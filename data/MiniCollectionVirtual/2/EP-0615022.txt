<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for optical data transmission between a fixed traffic device, in particular a beacon, and an individual vehicle passing the traffic device, the traffic device and the vehicle each having at least a transmitting and receiving unit and the traffic device having devices which permit exact identification of individual vehicles in specific limited areas, the said identification permitting reliable and effective transmission of data between the traffic device and the vehicle with a low outlay. For this purpose, there is provision for the transmitting and receiving unit (42, 44) of the vehicle (10) to have components of a head-up display (14).

Arrangement for optical data transmission between
a fixed traffic device, in particular a beacon, and an

individual vehicle passing the traffic device, the
traffic device and the vehicle each having at least one

transmit and receive unit, and the traffic device having
devices which permit precise identification of individual

vehicles in specific limited regions, characterized in
that the transmit and receive unit (42, 44) of the

vehicle (10) has components of a head-up display (14).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that a common optical system (16) is used for the

optical transmission of a head-up display image and of
the data.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the optical system (16) has

a component (22) which separates the signals for the
head-up display image and the data for the optical data

transmission.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a light source (38) of the

head-up display (14) is used as transmit unit for the
optical data transmission.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the 
signals for the optical
data transmission are emitted via an infrared

transmitter.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the component (22) for

decoupling the head-up display image and the optical data 
signals has a semi-transparent mirror (52).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that an infrared diode is used

as infrared transmitter (42).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the infrared receiver (44)

is actuated by means of a further semi-transparent mirror
which decouples the received optical data.
