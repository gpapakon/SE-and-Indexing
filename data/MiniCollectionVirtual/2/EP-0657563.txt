<ABSTRACT>
In a vacuum coating apparatus for applying thin layers to substrates (3, 3', ...), with an entry chamber (4), with at least one further chamber (5) for the treatment of the substrate (3, 3', ...) and with an exit chamber (4) as well as with a conveying device (7), arranged in an evacuable transport chamber (6), for transporting the substrates (3, 3', ...) through the chambers (4, 5, 6), there is provided a conveying device (7) which is arranged around a common axis (8) and which has mountings (9, 10) pivotable about the latter, in at least two positions, namely an entry and exit position and a treatment position, the mountings (9, 10) each executing a lifting movement relative to the wall (11) of the transport chamber (6), this lifting movement, in the first position, being such that, in the lifted position, the mounting (10) closes the orifice (17) of the entry/exit chamber (4) in the wall (11) of the transport chamber (3), a pot-shaped container (12, 13) for receiving a substrate (3, 3', ...) being capable of being placed in each case onto each mounting (9, 10), and, in the region of the treatment position (5), the mounting (9) lifting the container (12) until the top edge (16) of the container (12) comes to bear sealingly on the edge (14) of the orifice for the treatment chamber (5).

Vacuum coating installation for applying thin layers
onto substrates (3, 3', ...), having an inlet chamber

(4), at least one further chamber (5) for treating the
substrates (3, 3', ...) and having an outlet chamber

(4) as well as having a feed device (7) disposed in an
evacuable transport chamber (6) for feeding the

substrates (3, 3', ...) through the chambers (4, 5,
6), the feed device (7) being disposed around a common

axis (8) and comprising holding devices (9, 10)
capable of swivelling about said axis, wherein in at

least two positions, namely an inlet and outlet
position and a treatment position, the holding devices

(9, 10) are each movable up and down relative to the
wall (11) of the transport chamber (6), said upward

and downward movement in the first position being so
dimensioned that the holding device (10) in the raised

position closes the opening (17) of the inlet/outlet
chamber (4) in the wall (11) of the transport chamber

(6), 
characterized in
 that the installation has pot-shaped
containers (12, 13), one pot-shaped container

(12, 13) being mountable onto each holding device (9,
10) for receiving a substrate (3, 3', ...), and the

outside diameter (D
1
) of each container (12, 13) is
smaller than the inside diameter (D
2
) of the
inlet/outlet opening and the height (H
1
) of each
container (12, 13) corresponds substantially to the

total height of stroke of the holding devices (9, 10)
and the container (12) is movable upwards by the

lifting motor (22) in the region of the treatment
position (5) until the top edge (16) of the container

(12) is applied sealingly against the edge (14) of the
opening for the treatment chamber (5) or against a

collar or mask (15) inserted into the opening, the
opening diameter (D
3
) defined by the opening in the
wall (11) or by the collar or mask (15) being smaller

than the outside diameter (D
1
) of the top edge (16) of
the container (12, 13).
