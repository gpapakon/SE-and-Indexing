<ABSTRACT>
A combustion system wherein a defined uniform 
nonstoichiometric mixture of fuel (7) and oxygen is made in 

a compartment (3) outside a furnace zone and burned inside 
the furnace zone (1) in a luminous flame while additional 

make up oxygen (17) is provided into the furnace zone under 
conditions which avoid diminution of flame luminosity 

and high NO
x
 generation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to combustion 
systems which employ oxygen or oxygen-enriched air 
rather than air to carry out combustion with fuel. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are well known pollutants 
which are generated during combustion, especially 
combustion carried out at high temperatures. It is 
known that the levels of NOx generated during a 
combustion reaction may be reduced if pure oxygen or 
oxygen-enriched air instead of air is used to carry out 
the combustion because the large volumes of nitrogen 
present in air are kept away from the combustion 
reaction and thus kept away from reacting with the 
oxidant to form NOx if high flame temperatures can be 
avoided. Two recent significant advances in this 
technical field which enable oxygen combustion to 
proceed without high flame temperatures are the 
aspirating burner, disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,541,796-Anderson, and the stabilized jet burner, 
disclosed and claimed in U.S. 4,907,961-Anderson. Combustion with oxygen or oxygen-enriched air 
generally produces a flame which is not readily 
visually observable. In some situations it is 
desirable to carry out combustion with an easily 
observable or luminous flame, especially where 
adjustment of the flame shape or direction is desired. 
A flame which is not easily observable is more 
difficult to adjust accurately. It is known that the luminosity of a flame may be 
increased by carrying out the combustion in a manner  
 
wherein the fuel is not completely combusted. However, 
this mode of operation is undesirable both from a fuel 
consumption and an environmental perspective. The problem of obtaining a luminous flame occurs 
primarily when natural gas is the fuel. The main 
component of natural gas is methane. It is necessary 
to break down the methane to form carbon since it is 
the presence of carbon particles which is the primary 
source of luminosity in a flame. Carbon particles may 
be obtained by carrying out combustion in a fuel-rich 
portion and an oxygen-rich portion. However, such 
procedure is difficult to control effectively and, 
moreover, significant levels of NOx are formed in the 
oxygen-rich region of the combustion. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to 
provide a combustion system wherein a luminous flame is 
generated while the level of pollutants such as NOx is 
maintained at an acceptable level. The above and other objects which will become 
apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of 
this disclosure are attained by the present

A luminous combustion method comprising: 

(A) providing fuel into a first compartment 
communicating with a furnace zone; 
(B) providing from about 10 to 30 percent of 
the oxygen required to completely combust said fuel 

into the first compartment and mixing the fuel and 
oxygen within the first compartment to establish a 

uniform mixture of fuel and oxygen within the first 
compartment; 
(C) passing the fuel and oxygen mixture from 
the first compartment into the furnace zone in a 

uniform velocity profile, and thereafter combusting the 
fuel and oxidant mixture in a luminous flame within the 

furnace zone; 
(D) providing additional oxygen into a 
second compartment communicating with the furnace zone; 
(E) passing said additional oxygen from the 
second compartment into the furnace zone at a velocity 

about the same as the velocity of the mixture of fuel 
and oxygen passed into the furnace zone and at a point 

spaced from the point where the mixture of fuel and 
oxygen is passed into the furnace zone; and 
(F) combusting said additional oxygen with 
uncombusted fuel within the furnace zone.

to 25 percent of the oxygen required to completely 

combust the fuel is provided into the first 
compartment. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the oxygen 
provided into the first compartment is provided at a 

high velocity sufficient to entrain the fuel into the 
 

oxygen to achieve the uniform mixing, and the fuel and 
oxygen mixture passed from the first compartment into 

the furnace zone has a velocity less than that of the 
oxygen as it is passed into the first compartment.
