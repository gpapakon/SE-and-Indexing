<ABSTRACT>
A vane wheel (1) driven by a shaft (4s) for 
transferring a gas, comprising vortex flow chambers (9) 

opening in a direction substantially parallel to the shaft 
(4s) to receive the gas, to urge the gas in a substantially 

circumferential direction of the vane wheel (1), and to 
generate and accelerate a vortex flow of the gas, a vane 

member has a hub (8) through which the vane member is 
connected to the shaft (4s), a plurality of vanes (12) each 

of which extends integrally from the hub (8) in a 
substantially radial direction of the vane wheel (1) and 

includes a front surface for urging the gas in the 
substantially circumferential direction of the vane wheel 

(1), and a vortex flow chamber wall (10) extending 
integrally from both of the hub (8) and each of the vanes 

(12), and a cover (11) contacting with the vortex flow 

chamber wall (10) to form the vortex flow chambers (9) 
together with the vortex flow chamber wall (10) and the 

vanes (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vortex flow blower according
to the first part of claim 1, comprising a vane
wheel with three-dimensionally curved vane surfaces.Such a vortex flow blower is disclosed in JP-A-2-215997.
The vane wheel of this blower is divided into two
parts, and the parts are joined after the parts are formed
independently of each other. One part comprises a hub, the
row of vanes and a wall. The disc-shaped hub is formed integrally
with the radial inner edges of the vanes and the
ring-shaped wall is formed integrally on the radial outer
edges of the vanes in the radial plane of the hub. The
backside openings between the vanes are through-holes and
are covered by the second part. This second part is a cover
having a radial inner ring flange for fastening the cover
on the disc-shaped hub, a radial outer ring and a half-toroidal
middle portion contacting the rounded backside edges
of the vanes. This vortex flow blower also is shown in
Fig. 67 of EP-A-0 383 238 in which several other embodiments
of vortex blowers are disclosed. An object of the invention is to provide a vane
wheel which is divided into at least two members for easy
production, and whose rigidity, strength and vibration-absorbing
characteristic are high.For solving this object the vortex blower of the
invention is provided with the features of claim 1.Since the vane member has the vanes each of which
extends integrally or continuously from the hub in the substantially
radial direction of the vane wheel and the vortex
flow chamber wall extending integrally or continuously
from both of the hub and each of the vanes, the vortex flow
chamber wall supports the vanes strongly and rigidly on the
hub. Therefore, although the vane wheel is divided into the
vane member and the cover 
means, the rigidity and strength of the vanes are high.
Further, since the cover means contacts with the vortex
flow chamber wall, a friction between the cover means
and the vortex flow chamber wall (when an adhesive
adheres to the cover means and the vortex flow chamber
wall so that the cover means contacts with the vortex
flow chamber wall through the adhesive, a deformation of
the adhesive therebetween) absorbs a vibration of the
vane wheel, particularly a vibration generated in the
vortex flow chambers. A pressing force between the
cover means and the vortex flow chamber wall accelerates
to absorb the vibration. Therefore, although the vane
wheel is divided into the vane member and the cover
means, the vane wheel is restrained from generating the
vibration.T
