<ABSTRACT>
A sliding contact bearing, especially an aircraft landing gear trunnion bearing, comprises two bearing members (1, 3) composed of titanium or titanium alloy with cooperating sliding surfaces (2, 4), a first one of which is chromium plated and the second one of which is coated with nickel and fluorocarbon polymer. Preferably, the nickel coating is applied by an electroless plating process, and the fluorocarbon is infused into pores in the nickel plating. Preferably, the nickel and fluorocarbon coating is 0.025 to 0.041 mm thick, and has a hardness in the range 750-1000 VPN.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bearings, especially 
sliding contact bearings used in aircraft landing 
gear and incorporating titanium components in 
surface-to-surface sliding contact. Titanium is used in aircraft construction because 
it is lightweight compared with steel, but when 
used in bearings such as landing gear trunnion 
bearings that experience large shock loads, there 
can be problems with galling and seizure between 
titanium surfaces sliding on one another. It has 
been proposed in US-A-4848934 to overcome this 
problem by coating the surface of one titanium 
bearing component with chromium oxide and forming 
the other component of copper. Although chromium 
oxide is a brittle material, it is considered 
satisfactory provided the complementary bearing 
surface with which it cooperates includes copper 
or copper alloys. Furthermore, nickel and fluorocarbon polymer coatings of titanium or a 
titanium alloy are known from JP-A-1 158 217, FR-A-2 218 797 and US-A-4 846 122 
and a chromium plating from JP-A-61 000 596. According to the present invention a sliding 
contact bearing comprises two bearing members 
composed of titanium or a titanium alloy with  
 
cooperating sliding surfaces, characterised in 
that a first one of said surfaces is chromium 
plated and the second one of said surfaces is 
coated with nickel and fluorocarbon polymer. The nickel is preferably applied by an electroless 
plating process and provides a high level of wear 
and corrosion resistance. The fluorocarbon 
polymer is deposited on the metal surface so as to 
provide permanent lubrication between the two 
surfaces. A suitable nickel/fluorocarbon polymer 
coating may be provided by the General Magnaplate 
Corporation under their trade mark "NEDOX". Comparative tests indicate that a bearing 
according to the invention offers comparable 
performance and durability to that of conventional 
bearings comprising a chromium plated steel member 
in sliding cooperation with an aluminium bronze 
member and superior performance compared to 
bearings involving chromium plated, or chromium 
oxide coated or bronze coated bearing surfaces. 
Further, bearings according to the invention offer 
the advantage of limiting the friction between the 
bearing surfaces due to the effect of the 
fluorocarbon polymer used.  
 Figure 1 is a diametral cross-section through an 
aircraft landing gear trunnion bearing according 
to the invention, and Figure 2 is a graph of friction against bearing 
life for a bearing as shown in Figure 1 compared
