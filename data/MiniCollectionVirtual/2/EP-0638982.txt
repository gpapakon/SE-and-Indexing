closed at one end and a permanent magnet (2) fitted to 

the inner surface thereof. A case cap (6) closes the 
open end of the case (1), and a rotor (5) comprising an 

armature (3) and a commutator (4) is rotatably supported 
by bearings (9,10) provided on the closed end of the 

case and on the case cap (6). Input terminals are 
provided on the case cap (6), together with a retaining 

member (48) for holding a positive temperature 
coefficient resistor (49) against one of the input 

terminals (82,83). The retaining member (48) has a 
lanced and raised projection (57,61,63) and at least one 

retaining piece (58,62,74) which are directed towards 
the input terminal (82,83) and are adapted to engage and 

hold a resistor (49) thereagainst. The retaining member 
(48) makes no contact with the respective terminal 

(82,83), whether or not a resistor is installed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a miniature motor of the
type commonly used in audio equipment, precision
instruments and automotive electrical equipment.As miniature motors are low powered, overloading
(or stalling in extreme cases) may occur if the rotor is
impeded by rust or the entry of foreign matter into the
motor case for example; or if its operating limit is
reached. This leads to overheating or burning of the
windings of the armature. This problem may be addressed
by feeding the power to the armature via a positive
temperature coefficient resistor. In known miniature
motors, the resistor is commonly held between lugs
provided on an input terminal and a connecting piece. A
motor of this type is disclosed in Japanese Published
Unexamined Utility Model Application No. Hei-2(1990)-41664.
However as the resistor is retained only by the
frictional forces exerted by the lugs, it may be
dislodged by vibration or other external forces.
Increasing the holding force of the lugs increases the
pushing force required when inserting the resistor
during motor assembly. This may lead to damage of the
electrodes on the surface of the resistor and possibly
loss of the functions of the resistor. Furthermore, the
ability to control the holding forces is necessarily
limited by the particularly small size of the components
involved.Another disadvantage of a motor having the above
construction is that the lugs are configured to contact
each other if - the resistor is not present. Therefore,
the accidental omission of the resistor may be
undetected during assembly and inspection, because the
motor's electrical circuit is nevertheless continuous.Another prior art motor fed through a PCT resistor is disclosed in EP-A-0 511 776.The present invention is directed at an electric
motor construction in which a positive temperature
resistor may be reliably held within the motor case 
without the risk of damage during assembly. Also, the
absence of the resistor may be readily detected.Such a motor comprises a metallic tubular case
closed at one end with a permanent magnet fitted to the
inner surface thereof; a case cap closing the open end
of the case; a rotor comprising an armature and a
commutator, being rotatably supported by bearings
provided on the closed end of the case and on the case
cap; brushes supported on the case cap for making
sliding contact with the commutator; a pair of input
terminals electrically connected to the brushes and a
retaining member for connecting a brush to one of the
input terminals via a positive
