<ABSTRACT>
A filter screen structure for a backflushed liquid 
filter has a screen separating the raw-liquid side of the 

filter from the clean-liquid side thereof, including at 
least one row of substantially parallel rods extending along 

the screen, wherein the screen is threaded between the rods, 
partially enveloping the rods alternatingly from the 

raw-liquid side of the filter and from the clean-liquid side 
thereof. At least some of the rods are provided with 

substantially circumferential groove-like recesses, 
facilitating the passage of the liquid from the raw-liquid 

side via the screen to the clean-liquid side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid filter 
structure, especially for backflushed filter screens. Backflushed screens are exposed to two different forces 
acting in opposite directions, one being the direction of 
the main flow, the other the direction of the backflush. 
These opposite forces create a fatigue effect which, 
eventually, is liable to break the screen. Such a break is 
most likely to occur at stress concentration points which, 
with corrugated filter screens, are located at the 
corrugation edges. It is one of the objects of the present invention to 
provide a novel type of filter screen structure which is 
largely free of stress concentration points and will 
therefore ensure a substantially extended service life of 
the screen. According to the invention, this objective is achieved 
by providing a filter screen structure for a backflushed 
liquid filter having a screen separating the raw-liquid 
side of said filter from the clean-liquid side thereof, 
comprising at least one row of substantially parallel rods 
extending along said screen, wherein said screen is threaded 
between said rods, partially enveloping said rods 
alternatingly from the raw-liquid side of said filter and 
from the clean-liquid side thereof, at least some of said 
rods being provided with substantially circumferential 
groove-like recesses, facilitating the passage of said 
liquid from said raw-liquid side via said screen to said 
clean-liquid side.  The invention will now be described in connection with 
certain preferred embodiments with reference to the 
following illustrative figures so that it may be more fully 
understood. With specific reference now to the figures in detail, 
it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of 
example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the 
preferred embodiments of the present invention only, and are 
presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be 
the most useful and readily understood description of the 
principles and conceptual aspects of the invention. In this 
regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the 
invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental 
understanding of the invention, the description taken with 
the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how 
the several forms of the invention may be embodied in 
practice. Fig. 1is a schematic end view of a cylindrical filter 
screen structure according to the invention; Fig. 2is a side view of the structure of Fig. 1; Fig. 3represents the

<CLAIMS>
A filter screen structure for a backflushed liquid 
filter having a screen separating the raw-liquid side of 

said filter from the clean-liquid side thereof, comprising 
at least one row of substantially parallel rods extending 

along said screen, wherein said screen is threaded between 
said rods, partially enveloping said rods alternatingly from 

the raw-liquid side of said filter and from the clean-liquid 
side thereof, at least some of said rods being provided with 

substantially circumferential groove-like recesses, 
facilitating the passage of said liquid from said raw-liquid 

side via said screen to said clean-liquid side. 
The filter screen structure as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said filter screen structure comprises two rows of 

substantially uniformly spaced rods arranged along 
concentric circles and being mutually offset by about half 

their angular pitch. 
The filter screen structure as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said filter screen structure comprises two rows of 

uniformly spaced rods arranged along parallel lines and 
being mutually offset by about half their linear pitch. 
The filter screen structure as claimed in claim 1, 
further comprising a substantially cylindrical grid fitting 

inside said filter screen structure for the protection 
thereof. 
The filter screen structure as claimed in claim 1, 
further comprising a reinforcing belting helically wrapped 

around said structure. 
The filter screen structure as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
wherein the profile of at least some of said rods is 

provided with a neck portion. 
The filter screen structure as claimed in claim 6, 
wherein said neck portion protrudes beyond the center line 

of the adjacent row of rods.
