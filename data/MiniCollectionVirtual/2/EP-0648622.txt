<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a tread portion (12) 
provided with at least one circumferential groove 

(8) having an axially inner groove wall (6) and an 
axially outer groove wall (7), characterised in that 

the radially outer edges (6E,7E)of the axially inner 
and outer groove walls (6,7) are disposed towards 

the tyre equator, the axially inner groove wall (6) 
intersecting the tread face (2) at an inclination 

angle (alpha) of from 25 to 45 degrees with respect 
to the normal line to the tread face, and the 

axially outer groove wall (7) intersecting the tread 
face (2) at an inclination angle (beta) of from O to 

20 degrees with respect to the normal line to the 
tread face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre in 
which, by specifically limiting the inclination 
angles of the groove walls of a circumferential 
groove, running noise is reduced without 
deteriorating the aquaplaning resistance. In recent years, along with the development of 
automobile technology, increasing speeds and vehicle 
power have made new requirements for tyres which has 
in general caused the tyre aspect ratio to be 
lowered. In such a low aspect ratio tyre, as the ground 
contacting width is relatively large, running noise 
is liable to be increased and the aquaplaning 
phenomenon is liable to occur. In general, a tyre is provided in the tread portion 
with a plurality of wide grooves extending 
continuously in the tyre circumferential direction 
formed with axially inner and outer groove walls. 
Conventionally the axially inner groove wall 
inclines towards the tyre equator and the axially 
outer groove wall inclines towards the tread edge.  
 Such a conventional circumferential groove has a 
good drainage performance in its longitudinal 
direction, but causes an air resonance noise. This 
noise is generated by the air in the cavity formed 
between the circumferential groove and the road 
surface in the ground contacting patch being 
vibrated during running. The frequency spectrum of 
this noise has a maximum peak at a specific 
frequency, the wave length of which corresponds to 
twice the cavity length. JP-A-63-68406 discloses a tyre showing the features of 
the preamble of claim 1. In the case of a passenger car tyre, the maximum 
peak frequency lies around 800 Hz to 1 kHz, which is 
the most sensitive range for human ears, and thus 
this air resonance is a major source of the noise 
from the tyre since the noise from other factors is 
well reduced nowadays. If the volume of the circumferential groove is 
decreased, the resonance can be prevented and the 
noise can be reduced. However, a decrease in the 
drainage performance is inevitable, and aquaplaning 
is then liable to occur. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre in which the running  
 
noise (coasting noise) especially the above-explained 
air resonance noise is reduced without 
deteriorating the aquaplaning resistance. According to the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprises a tread portion provided 
with at least one circumferential groove having an 
axially inner groove wall and an axially outer 
groove wall, the radially 
outer edges of the axially inner and outer groove
