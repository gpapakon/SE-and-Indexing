<ABSTRACT>
An enzyme, which has a molecular weight of about 
57,000-120,000 daltons on SDS-PAGE and a pI of about 3.8-5.1 

on isoelectrophoresis using ampholyte, converts maltose into 
trehalose and 
vice versa
. The enzyme was isolated from 
microorganisms of the genera 
Pimelobacter
, 
Pseudomonas
 and 

Thermus
. By using the enzyme, trehalose is readily formed from 
a commercially available maltose in an industrial scale and a 

relatively-low cost. Trehalose and saccharide compositions 
containing the same, which are preparable with the enzyme, are 

suitably used in food products, cosmetic compositions and 
pharmaceutical compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel enzyme, and
preparation and uses thereof. More particularly, the present
invention relates to an enzyme which converts maltose into
trehalose or converts trehalose into maltose (hereinafter
designated as "maltose-trehalose converting enzyme"), as well
as to preparation thereof. The present invention further
relates to a microorganism capable of producing the enzyme,
trehalose prepared with the enzyme, saccharide compositions
containing the trehalose, and compositions containing the
trehalose or the saccharide composition.Trehalose or α, α-trehalose has been known as a non-reducing
saccharide consisting of glucoses. As is described
in Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry, Vol.18, pp.201-225
(1963), published by Academic Press, USA, and Applied and
Environmental Microbiology, Vol.56, pp.3,213-3,215 (1990),
trehalose widely exists in microorganisms, mushrooms, insects,
etc., though the content is relatively low. Trehalose is a
non-reducing saccharide, so that it neither reacts with
substances containing amino groups such as amino acids and
proteins, induces the amino-carbonyl reaction, nor deteriorates
amino acid-containing substances. Thus, trehalose can be used
without a fear of causing an unsatisfactory browning and 
deterioration. Because of these, the establishment of an
industrial-scale preparation of trehalose has been in great
demand.Conventional preparations of trehalose are, for
example, those disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No.154,485/75 wherein microorganisms are utilized, and in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.216,695/83 wherein maltose is
converted into trehalose by the combination use of maltose- and
trehalose-phosphorylases. The former, however, is not suitable
for the industrial-scale preparation because the content of
trehalose present in microorganisms as a starting material is
usually lower than 15 w/w % (the wording "w/w %" is abbreviated
as "%" in the specification, unless otherwise specified), on
a dry solid basis (d.s.b.), and the extraction and purification
steps are complicated. The latter has the following demerits:
(i) Since trehalose is formed via glucose-1-phosphate, the
concentration of maltose as a substrate could not be set to a
satisfactorily high-level; (ii) the enzymatic reaction systems
of the phosphorylases are reversible reactions, and their
yields of the objective trehalose are relatively low; and (iii)
it is substantially difficult to retain their reaction systems
stably and to proceed their enzymatic reactions smoothly.
