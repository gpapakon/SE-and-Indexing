<ABSTRACT>
The head in a series of video images is 
identified by digitizing sequential images, subtracting a 

previous image from an input image to determine moving 
objects, calculating boundary curvature extremes of 

regions in the subtracted image, comparing the extremes 
with a stored model of a human head to find regions shaped 

like a human head, and identifying the head with a 
surrounding shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and means for 
detecting people in image sequences, and particularly for 
locating people in video images to facilitate visual 
communication. Locating people in video images can facilitate 
automatic camera panning, interfacing of humans and 
machines, automatic security applications, human traffic 
monitoring, image compression and other applications. U.S. Patent No. 5,086,480 attempts to identify 
people in video images by subtracting corresponding image 
elements of subsequent images, thresholding the image 
elements against a luminous threshold to eliminate noise, 
filtering and clustering the resulting data sets, 
determining the minimum rectangle which will contain the 
sets, generating a border of finite thickness around the 
rectangles, and generating a head code book from the 
elements in the original images that correspond to the 
elements represented by the respective sets of data that 
fall within the respective borders. The patentee assumes 
that there is a moving head within any image which will 
provide the subtracted output. However, if a person in 
the image raises a hand, the disclosed method may confuse 
a hand and a head. An object of the invention is to improve 
systems for identifying persons in a series of images. Another object of the invention is to overcome 
the aforementioned difficulties. According to a feature of the invention, these 
objects are attained, by obtaining the difference between  
 
one image and a previous image to extract regions of 
motion; comparing local curvature extremes at the boundary 
of motion regions with a stored model of a human head; and 
identifying the local boundary corresponding to the model 
of the human head. According to another feature of the invention, 
the step of obtaining the difference between an image with 
a previous image includes digitizing the images before 
obtaining the difference. According to another feature of the invention, 
the step of comparing the local boundary curvature 
extremes includes calculating the local extremes of 
curvature of the boundaries before comparing them with the 
stored model. According to yet another feature of the 
invention, the step of comparing includes fitting a 
surrounding annular shape to the portion of the region 
boundary corresponding to a human head and neck. These and other features of the invention are 
pointed out in the claims. Other objects and advantages 
of the invention will become evident from the following 
detailed description when read in
