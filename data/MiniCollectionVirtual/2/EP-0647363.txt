<ABSTRACT>
An improved apparatus for cutting and stripping insulated wire. The apparatus includes a pair of cutting and stripping units which are mounted on a supporting structure in opposed relation and each cutting and stripping unit includes a central cutting knife and a pair of stripping knives, spaced laterally on opposite sides of the cutting knife. The insulated wire is fed between the cutting and stripping units and when a predetermined length of wire has been fed, the cutting units are moved toward each other in a first stroke of movement to cause the cutting knives to cut a length of wire. The wire and the cut length are then moved axially away from each other by gripping units in a first stroke of movement to position the cut end of the wire at the end of the cut length between the cutting knives and the respective stripping knives. The cutting and stripping units are then moved toward each other in a second stroke of movement to cut the insulation, and the gripping units are subsequently moved in a direction away from each other in a second stroke of movement to strip the insulation from the cut end of the wire and from the cut length. A mechanism is provided for adjusting the first stroke of movement of the gripping units to adjust the strip length and a second adjusting mechanism is included to adjust the stripping stroke of the cutting and stripping units to accomodate different gauges of wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
Electrical harnesses are produced by cutting insulated 
wire to the desired length, stripping the insulation from 
the cut ends and then applying terminals to one or both 
ends of the cut length. In the typical wire cutting and 
stripping process, wire is contained on a supply coil and 
fed in the desired increment of length to a cutting and 
stripping station by cooperating feed rolls or belts. The 
conventional cutting and stripping station includes a pair 
of opposed cutting and stripping units, each of which is 
composed of a central cutting knife and a pair of stripping 
knives which are located in spaced relation on either side 
of the cutting knife. After the predetermined length of 
wire has been fed through the cutting and stripping 
station, the cutting and stripping units are moved toward 
each other by fluid cylinders causing the cutting knives to 
sever the wire and simultaneously causing the stripping 
knives to cut the insulation. Wire gripping units, located both upstream and 
downstream from the cutting and stripping station, grip the 
wire, as well as the cut length, and move the wire and cut 
length in opposite directions, thereby stripping the 
insulation from the ends of the wire and from the cut 
length. In one common form of cutting and stripping units, the 
stripping knives are spaced from the cutting knife by 
spacer blocks and the entire assembly is clamped in a fixed 
position in a knife block. With this arrangement, the 
stripping knives are mounted in a fixed position relative 
to the cutting knives, so that both the cutting and 
stripping is accomplished in one operation. To change the 
strip length, the stripping knives must be manually removed 
from the knife blocks and relocated. Further, in order to  
 
accommodate wires of different gauges, it is necessary to 
utilize a different set of knives in the knife block. It has also been proposed to manually adjust the 
position of the stripping knives relative to the cutoff 
knife via screws and slides. With this system, the position 
of the stripping knives can be adjusted without removal, 
but exact alignment is difficult. A further proposal has been to separate the stripping 
knives from the cutting knives, so that cutting is done at 
one station and stripping at a second station. However, 
this is not only costly, but requires an additional process 
station for both the lead and trailing ends of the cut 
length of wire. The invention is directed to an improved wire cutting 
and stripping mechanism having full
