<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition
having low linear expansion coefficient, excellent dimensional
stability and an excellent balance between impact
resistance and rigidity.In recent years, for the purpose of reducing fuel consumption
by weight saving of automobiles, plastics have been
frequently used as parts for automobiles, and various plastic
materials have been used not only for interior parts
such as an instrument panel, a console box, a glove box, a
handle and a trim and exterior parts such as a protection
mold, a lamp housing, a front grille, a mud guard and a
side bumper, but also for a bumper, a fascia, a fender, a
door panel and a part of a body for which metallic materials
have been conventionally used.As plastics used for the above parts for automobiles, there
may be mentioned, for example, RIM (reaction injection
molding) urethane, composite polypropylene, inorganic substance-reinforced
plastics such as glass fiber-reinforced
polyamide and polymer alloy materials such as polycarbonate/polybutylene
terephthalate (PC/PBT) and polyphenylene
ether/polyamide (PPE/PA). Among these materials, as the
composite polypropylene, there have been described, for 
example, polypropylene type compositions in which a partially
crosslinked ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber and
oil are formulated into polypropylene in Japanese Provisional
Patent Publications No. 145857/1978, No. 16554/1979
and No. 135847/1982, and as the polymer alloy of PPE/PA,
there has been disclosed, for example, a composition in
which a rubber modified with a polar group-containing
compound is added as an impact modifier to a combination of
polyphenylene ether and polyamide in Japanese Provisional
Patent Publication No. 49753/1981. Further, for the purpose
of improving a balance between low temperature impact
resistance and rigidity, there has been proposed a composition
comprising a modified polyphenylene ether intermediate,
polyamide and an impact modifier in Japanese Provisional
Patent Publication No. 19664/1989.Further high level characteristics of a material used for a
fascia, a fender and a door panel have been particularly
demanded as compared with those of conventional plastic
parts. There may be mentioned, for example, (1) impact
resistance: a characteristic of absorbing energy at the
time of crash by distortion and then recovering from distortion
and a characteristic of ductile fracture by impact
at low temperatures; and (2) dimensional stability by low
linear expansion coefficient in order to solve
