<ABSTRACT>
An encoder contains a contact support (3) and a coding disk (4), which coding disk (4) can be set into a plurality of rotation positions relative to the contact support (3), in order to set corresponding codes. Furthermore, the coding disk (4) can be displaced (is adjustable) between an inactive position, in which it is at a distance from the contact support (3) and no coding acts, and an active position in which coding is set, via the coding disk (4), on the contact support (3), which coding corresponds to the rotation position of said coding disk (4). Since the coding disk (4) can be set into various rotation positions for code selection in the inactive position, the code selection can be carried out in an electrically floating manner.
