<CLAIMS>
Particles which are suitable as carriers for 
electrophotography and consist of 


a) a magnetic core and 
b) a shell of molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide or tin 
oxide or a mixture thereof. 
A process for the preparation of the particles as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein volatile molybdenum, tungsten 

and/or tin compounds are decomposed by reaction with 
steam and/or oxygen in the gas phase in the presence of 

agitated cores. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
volatile compounds used are the metal halides or 

carbonyls. 
Use of particles as claimed in claim 1 for the 
preparation of an electrophotographic two-component 

developer. 
An electrophotographic two-component developer, 
containing the particles as claimed in claim 1.
