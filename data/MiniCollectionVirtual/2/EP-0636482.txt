<ABSTRACT>
In the case that a size of each liquid droplet 
is enlarged to such an extent that liquid droplets 

each having a different color comes in contact with 
each other on a printing medium before completion of 

penetration into the printing medium, e.g., when the 
number of liquid droplets nb required for forming a 

black pixel and the number of liquid droplets ny 
required for forming a yellow pixel are "7", a 

maximum number of liquid droplets capable of 
overlapping each other at a substantially same 

location is limitatively determined to assume a 
value smaller than the numeral "7" that is a 

normally employed maximum numeral with respect to at 
least one ink color, e.g., yellow, whereby an image 

can be obtained without any deterioration of a 
quality while preventing a malfunction of color-staining 

from arising along the boundary between 
adjacent ranges each having an ink color.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
ink jet printing apparatus and an ink jet printing
method. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an ink jet printing apparatus and an ink
jet printing method both of which assure that one
dot is formed by shooting a plurality of liquid
droplets onto a printing medium at a substantially
same location thereof.An ink jet printing apparatus is used for
ejecting ink from ejection outlets of an ink jet
printing head to a printing medium in the form of
very small liquid droplets so that an image such as
a character, a figure, a picture or the like is
printed on the printing medium. Among various kinds
of ink jet printing apparatuses, an ink jet color
printing apparatus is used to form a pixel with a
plurality of colored inks typically composed of a
black-colored ink, a cyan colored ink, a magenta-colored
ink and a yellow-colored ink by making a
combination among these colored inks in accordance
with a desired color to dispose respectively on the
printing medium or to overlap each other on the
printing medium. It has been hitherto known that 
the ink jet ink printing apparatus exhibits highly
acceptable advantages not only as high resolution
color image outputting means but also as high speed
printing means.It should be noted that a printing medium to be
used in the ink jet printing apparatus should not be
limited only to a sheet of recording paper, a sheet
of paper for OHP or the like each of which has been
widely known but a various kind of medium capable of
allowing ink to be fitted thereto, e.g., a
printing/dyeing cloth is also employable as a
printing medium. Accordingly, it should be
construed that not only a sheet of recording paper
but also a various kind of printing medium capable
of allowing ink to be printed thereon are employable
for an ink jet printing apparatus and an ink jet
printing method as will be described later.A method of representing a gradation in an image
printed by an ink jet printing apparatus of the
foregoing type is exemplified by a method of
representing a gradation by binarizing an image
signal based on a predetermined threshold value
while a single pixel is formed in response to that
image signal, (hereinafter referred to as a Dither
method) and a method of representing a gradation in
an image depending on the number of liquid droplets
forming a single dot which is formed by shooting a
plurality of liquid droplets onto a printing medium
at a substantially same location as disclosed in
Japanese Patent Application

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet printing apparatus operable to perform
printing with an ink jet head (90) adapted to eject ink

droplets therefrom by ejecting ink droplets from said ink
jet head onto a printing medium (1) to form dots

corresponding to image data defining for each dot a
quantity of ink to be ejected, the quantity of ink being

defined by a number of ink droplets ejected to
substantially the same region; the apparatus comprising;


judging means (201,S11) operable to judge the
quantities of ink defined by the image data in relation

to a degree of mixing of ink between adjacent dots; and
suppressing means (201,S13) responsive to the judging

means and operable to suppress the quantity of ink
ejected to decrease mixing between adjacent dots;

wherein the apparatus is operable to print each dot
from a quantity of ink in accordance with the image data

and to control the quantity of ink forming each dot by
ejecting and depositing a respective number of droplets

defined by the image data;
the judging means is operable to judge for adjacent
dots whether the total quantity of the ink droplets for

the adjacent dots is equal to or greater than a
predetermined quantity of ink;
and the suppressing means is operable to suppress
the quantity of ink droplets to form at least one dot of 

said adjacent dots.
