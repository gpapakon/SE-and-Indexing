<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cylinder head construction 
for an internal combustion engine, in particular a diesel 

engine having a pre-combustion chamber which, at least 
partially is defined by an insert piece which is disposed in 

the surrounding cylinder head portion in a heat insulating 
manner. Moreover the insert piece may project into the main 

combustion chamber or may be recessed therefrom for added 
combustion efficiency. The insert may be mounted in the recess 

with fasteners or with a separate mounting plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a two-stroke cycle internal
combustion engine comprising a cylinder block with at least one
cylinder bore having at least one exhaust passage and at least
one scavenging port opposite to the exhaust passage for each
cylinder formed through the upper portion of the cylinder
block, a cylinder head comprising a first portion having a
sealing surface adapted to sealingly engage the associated
cylinder block around the cylinder bore to form at least in
part a combustion chamber defined by a cylinder head combustion
chamber surface surrounded by said sealing surface, said
combustion chamber surface of said cylinder head being formed
with a recess, an insert piece received at least in part within
said recess and affixed to said cylinder head, said insert
piece forming at least in part a prechamber, and means defining
a throat portion, communicating said prechamber with said
combustion chamber.It is well known that in certain types of engines it is
desirable to provide a sub or precombustion chamber in which
combustion is initiated before combustion begins in the main
combustion chamber. Once combustion is initiated in the
prechamber, the burning gases exit into the main chamber
through a throat and ensure complete burning in the main
chamber. This type of construction is frequently employed in
diesel engines wherein the fuel is injected into the
prechamber and initiates burning there and then emanates into
the main chamber for continued combustion.With this type of arrangement, it is generally the
practice to form the prechamber at least in part from an
insert piece that is affixed to the remainder of the cylinder
head. Normally the cylinder head is formed from a lighter
weight more heat conductive material than the insert piece.
The insert piece, because it must be subjected to the higher
temperatures and pressures in the prechamber, is normally
formed from a more heat resistant material, such as a steel
like SUH 3. With the normal attachment methods, the heat
resistant insert is in direct contact over a substantial area
with the remaining cylinder head material. It is, however, desirable to ensure that the prechamber
surfaces are maintained at a relatively high temperature so
as to ensure good initiation of combustion. However, since
the insert piece is in direct heat engaging relationship with
the remainder of the cylinder head which, as has been noted,
has a high thermal conductivity, then the insert piece will
be rapidly cooled between ignition cycles, and it is
difficult to
