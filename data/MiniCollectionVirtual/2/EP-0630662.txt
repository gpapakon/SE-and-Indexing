<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for securing an electrode lead to an apparatus for emitting electrical pulses, in particular a pace-maker or a defibrillator. The apparatus is provided with a connection member in which the securing device for the proximal end of the electrode lead is fitted, the proximal end of the electrode lead being pin-shaped. In order to obtain a securing device of the type mentioned which has a very simple structure and can thus be produced in an inexpensive manner and which, moreover, is extremely simple to handle and, at the same time, ensures satisfactory securing of the electrode cable and reliable electrical connection between the electrode lead and the apparatus, it is proposed, according to the invention, that the securing device (4) comprise a spring element (6) which is arranged approximately at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the proximal end of the electrode lead (5) which is to be fixed, and that the spring element (6) be provided with clamping means (7) for securing the proximal end of the electrode lead (5). The spring element (6) is partially transferred into a first position in which the clamping means (7) assume a position such that the proximal end of the electrode lead (5) can pass the clamping means (7), and can be partially transferred into a second position in which the clamping means (7) engage and secure the proximal end of the electrode lead (5).

Arrangement for fixing a pin-shaped proximal
end (15) of an electrode cable (5) in a connecting

portion (3) of a heart pacemaker (1) or a
defibrillator, in which the fixing arrangement (4)

comprises a spring element (6) which is arranged so as
to be substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal

axis of the proximal end of the electrode cable (5)
that is to be fixed, in which the spring element (6) is

provided with clamping means (7) for fixing the
proximal end of the electrode cable (5), and in which

the spring element (6) can partly occupy a first
position in which the clamping means (7) occupy such a

position that the proximal end of the electrode cable
(5) can pass through the clamping means (7) in a

contact-free manner, and can partly occupy a second
position in which the clamping means (7) act upon and

fix the proximal end of the electrode cable (5),
characterised in that the clamping means (7) are

arranged on a radially outer region of the spring
element (6).
Arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that the spring element (6) is a

curved disc, in which case the curvature of the disc
(6) in the first position points towards the proximal

end of the electrode cable (5) that is to be inserted
and in the second position points in the opposite

direction.
Arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that the spring element (6) has a V-shaped

profile so that the inside diameter of the
clamping means (7) is smaller that the outside diameter

of the proximal pin-shaped end of the electrode cable
(5) that is to be inserted.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the clamping means (7) are fitted

on the spring element (6) so as to be evenly
distributed in the latter's peripheral direction.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the clamping means (7) are formed

in a spherical manner.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the clamping means (7) are

electrically connected to an electrical connecting
point (10) that is provided in the heart pacemaker (1)

or in the defibrillator.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the spring element (6) and/or the

clamping means (7) consist of a material that can be
influenced by a magnet.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1, 2
and 4 to 7, characterised in that the fixing

arrangement (4) is arranged in a housing (8) that has
the form of a truncated cone, the base of which is

secured to the heart pacemaker (1) or to the
defibrillator, with the largest inside diameter of the

housing (8) being slightly larger than the spring
element (6) in an extended position and with the

incline of the inside wall of the truncated cone being
selected so that the latter substantially follows a

curve that describes the peripheral surface of the
spring element (6) when the spring element (6) is moved

from an extended position into a second position.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the central region of that side

of the spring element (6) that is directed towards the
heart pacemaker (1) or the defibrillator is fixedly

connected to the heart pacemaker (1) or to the
defibrillator.
