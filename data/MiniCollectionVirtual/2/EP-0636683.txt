of an electric field and a structural viscosity satisfying

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrorheological fluid. More specifically, it relates to
an electrorheological fluid which has excellent properties
in that a large shear stress and low current density can be
generated even when a reratively low electrical field is
applied to the fluid and the generated shear stress and
current density has excellent stability properties with time
(durability). The invention also has excellent properties
in regard to dispersion stability under the conditions of no
electrical field (the ability to uniformly maintain an
electrorheological fluid and not settle or float the
disperse phase therein), redispersibility (the ability to
duplicate a uniform electrorheological fluid by applying a
simple external force when the dispersed phase therein has
settled and floats in a non-uniform state), and fluidity
(having a low viscosity under the conditions of no
electrical field).There are known, as electrorheological fluid
generating high shear stress, a fluid in which a powdered
ion-exchange resin is dispersed in the higher alkyl ester of
an aromatic carboxylic acid (JP-A-50-92278), a composition
composed of a crystalline material which conducts current
only along one of the three crystalline axes, a dielectrical
fluid, and suspension stabilizing agent (JP-A-1-170693), and
a fluid using, as a disperse phase, a conductive particle
covered with a film layer of insulating material (JP-A-64-6093).
However, these electrorheological fluids have the
disadvantages of poor dispersion stability under the
conditions of no electricalal field, poor re-dispersibility
after sedimentation and floatation, and poor fluidity when
the concentration of the disperse phase is increased.In order to improve the dispersion stability, there
have been proposed the use of modified polysiloxane as an
composite polymer (JP-A-3-39560), the use of a polymer
having an ester group and an aromatic group structure as the 
composite polymer (JP-A-4-96997) or the like. However,
these composite polymers serve only to prevent the
sedimentation of the disperse phase, but have the drawback
of a reduction of the re-dispersibility after sedimentation.Further, in order to improve the re-dispersibllity,
there have been proposed electrorheological fluids using
fine particles as the composite polymer (JP-A-3-160094 and
JP-A-3-166295) or the like. However, these
electrorheological fluids have problems in that the shear
stress obtained when an electrical field is applied,
decreases due to the addition of the fine particles,
