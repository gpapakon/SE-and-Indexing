<ABSTRACT>
An attachment to a parenteral device (11) where the parenteral device (11) comprises a body (12) having a duct (15) which is to convey a parenteral fluid, the attachment comprising a housing (20) adapted to be removably engageable with the body (12) and to be rigidly supported by the body when in engagement therewith, the housing (20) having a flow path (22, 23) which communicates with the duct (15) on engagement of the housing with the body; a hollow needle body (26) slidably supported within the housing (20) and comprising a hollow needle having a free end; the needle body (26) is slidably received within the housing (20) for movement between a first position at which the free end is received within the housing and a second position at which the free and extends from the housing, and the needle body is movable from the second position to the first position; a retaining means (27, 32, 33) provided to retain the needle body (26) in the first or second position; the needle having a first aperture (28) provided at or adjacent the free end, and a second aperture (29) provided in the needle body (26) spaced from the free end, the second aperture (29) being in communication with the flow path (22, 23) when the needle body is in the second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an attachment for a parenteral device.Throughout this specification the term "parenteral device"
shall be taken to include any device which can be used for
the conveyance of parenteral fluids which are to be
introduced into or drawn from the body and shall include
within its scope a syringe, a cannula, hypodermic needle,
intravenous infusion line and the like devices.The parenteral device according to the invention relates to
one in which the needle body which incorporates a needle is
slidably supported in the body of the device to be movable
between a first position at which the needle body and
needle are fully accommodated within the body to be
inaccessible and a second position at which the needle is
caused to extend beyond the body whereby on the needle
being moved to the second position it is in communication
with a chamber or duct to or from which fluid can be
transferred through the needle.A difficulty which exists in relation to any form of
parenteral device which incorporates a needle relates to
the danger of inadvertent pricking of the user or another
person during the assembly and utilisation of the device
and its subsequent disposal.Furthermore, while devices are available which provide for
a retractable needle such devices are specialised.It is an object of this invention to provide
an attachment to
a parenteral
device of the form described above where once the
parenteral device has been used the needle can be withdrawn
to be inaccessible. Furthermore it is an object of the 
invention to provide a device which can be used with
existing parenteral devices.Previously syringes have been proposed which incorporate
retractable needles, however the interrelationship between
the components of the syringe have resulted in a variety of
complex arrangements. These forms of retractable syringe
have been found to be of limited acceptability because of
their complexity and consequent cost of manufacture.Another arrangement is disclosed in EP 0479303,
which was not published at the priority date of the present application
and
comprises a retractable device which is to be attached to a
specially modified syringe. The attachment accommodates a
retractable needle. This device however requires that the
needle be in an extended position prior to its use and on
completion of the stroke of the plunger of the syringe the
needle is irretrievably retracted into the body of the
attachment. As a result the device does not avoid the
possibility of an accidental "stick" injury or
contamination

<CLAIMS>
An attachment for a parenteral device (11) comprising
a body (12) having a duct for conveying parenteral fluid

and a first opening (15) at its outer end, the attachment
comprising a housing (20) adapted to be removably

engageable with the body and to be rigidly supported by the
body when in engagement therewith, a hollow needle body

(26) slidably supported within a passageway provided in the
housing and comprising a hollow needle having a free end

(28); means for moving the needle body from a first
position at which the free end is received within the

housing to a second position at which the free end extends
from the housing and from the second position to the first

position, and the needle body being movable from the second
position to the first position; a retaining means

(27,32,33) provided to retain the needle body in the first
or second position; the needle having a first aperture

provided at or adjacent to the free end, and a second
aperture (29) provided in the needle body spaced from the

free end, the housing having a flow path (23) extending
between a second opening formed in the housing and the

passageway, the second opening being adapted to be
sealingly engaged with the first opening

of the parenteral device
on engagement of

the housing with the body; the second aperture being in
communication with the flow path when the needle body is in

the second position.
An attachment according to claim 1, wherein the second
opening is provided in a socket (22) which is shaped to be

sealing engaged, in use, with a tubular boss, the duct
being at least partially accommodated, in use, in the

tubular boss which is formed on the exterior of the body to
form the first opening (15) at the outer end of the boss.
An attachment according to claim 2, wherein the
housing (20) is formed with a laterally directed bracket 

(24) which is engagable with the body (12) at a position
spaced from the socket (22), the socket and bracket being

offset laterally on the housing and being adapted to engage
the body in opposed relation to each other.
An attachment according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein
the housing is formed with at least one lateral arm (25)

which extends laterally from the housing (20), the at least
one lateral arm being configured, in use, to at least

partially extend around the body (12) and clampingly engage
the body.
An attachment according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the means for moving the needle body

is provided by the needle body being formed with a handle
(27) which extends laterally from the housing through an

axial slot (31) in the wall thereof, whereby slidable
movement of the handle in the slot causes the slidable

movement of the needle body (26).
An attachment according to claim 5, wherein the
retaining means comprises a lateral extension (32,33) of

the slot at two spaced locations along the length of the
slot (31) corresponding to the location of the handle (27)

when the needle body (26) is respectively at its first and
second position, the needle body being capable of rotation

within the housing (20) to enable the handle to be located
in the respective lateral extension when the needle body is

at its first or second position.
An attachment according to claim 6, wherein the
lateral extensions (32,33) have an entry of reduced width.
An attachment according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the portion of the housing (20) providing

the passageway is substantially tubular and a seal (30) is
provided between the interior walls of the passageway to 

each side of the flow path, the seals sealingly engaging
the needle body (26).
An attachment according to claim 8, wherein means is
provided to render the seal inactive on the needle body

(26) being moved to the second position from the first
position.
An attachment according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein a locking means is provided between the

housing (20) and the needle body (26), to lock the needle
body in position in the housing when the needle body is in

the first position and the second position.
An attachment according to claim 10, wherein a further
seal is provided to close the second aperture (29).
A combination of a parenteral device and an attachment
according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
