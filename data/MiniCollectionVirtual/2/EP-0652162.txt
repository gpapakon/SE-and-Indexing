<ABSTRACT>
A cap for a keg spear has internal teeth (13), which snap-engage over an 
annular projection on the spear. A tamper-evident ring (40) is provided 

on the cap skirt (12) and connected to the skirt by radial tags (41) having 
point attachment to the skirt. The ring obstructs access to the skirt for 

levering off the cap, so that any such attempt loosens the ring by breaking 
the tags to provide tamper evidence. The ring (40) is securely fixed to a 

tab (30,31) defined by a pair of lines of weakness extending axially in the 
skirt (12) and radially across the top (11) of the cap. The ring can be 

used as a handle to split the cap for removal in one piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tamper-evident cap for a keg spear, as provided 
on beer kegs. A keg spear is screw-engaged in a keg and has an external access portion 
comprising a peripheral wall defining a recess, an access device being 
provided in the recess. The peripheral wall is provided with an outwardly extending annular 
projection and a tamper-evident cap has a ring of teeth, which can be 
snap-engaged over the annular projection to cover the recess and prevent 
the keg contents being accessed without removal of the cap. The keg spears are generally made with the peripheral walls of the same 
diameter, within tolerances. The annular projections are made of different 
profiles by different manufacturers and the different profiles have, for 
example, varying axial depths. This makes it difficult to produce a cap, 
which is satisfactory with all keg spears. The cap has to be sufficiently resilient to snap over the annular projections 
of different profiles, but must be brittle enough for the cap to break, if an 
attempt is made to remove the cap. This has proven to be difficult to 
achieve in practice. Use of brittle materials means that different caps have to be made for 
different profiles and/or there are numerous failures when the caps are 
applied, whereas use of less brittle materials enables the cap to be 
removable without damage. This is sometimes achieved by gently 
warming the cap, if it is thermoplastic, so that it becomes easier to  
 
remove. One tamper-evident cap relies on brittleness of the material, so that the 
teeth, snap-engaged over the annular projection, break when an attempt is 
made to remove the cap. This is unsatisfactory for several reasons. The cap is not usable with all keg spears, because of poor tolerances. The 
brittleness of the material means that tolerances have to be small. The breaking of some of the teeth is not an immediately clear indication 
that a cap has been tampered with. It is necessary to break the teeth to open a keg, so that there are always 
tooth remnants produced. GB-A-2082151 proposed an arrangement in which the skirt of the cap, 
provided with the teeth, had a tapering portion below the teeth, which 
would break when an attempt was made to remove the cap. It has, 
however, proved difficult to make a cap, which is effective, because of the 
conflicting requirements of resilience, for snap-engagement on keg spears 
of different profiles, and brittleness to provide tamper-evidence, in 
particular, because of the possibility of increasing the

<CLAIMS>
A tamper-evident cap for a keg spear, the cap comprising a top (11) 
and a skirt (12) provided with a ring of internally projecting means (13) 

snap-engageable over an annular flange on the keg spear to resist removal 
of the cap, a tamper-evident ring (40) of larger diameter than the skirt 

(12), being attached to the skirt adjacent its free end remote from the top 
(11), the ring (40) extending axially away from the top (11) and being 

attached to the skirt (12) by several frangible tags (41) spaced around the 
ring and extending radially between the skirt and the ring; the skirt (12) 

having an axial weakened portion (19a, 19b) at a circumferential location 
(30) and the ring being securely fixed to the skirt adjacent said 

circumferential location; characterised in that the weakened portion does 
not extend into the ring (40), whereby the ring can be detached from the 

skirt, except at said location, by breaking of the tags (41) and used as a 
handle to split the skirt at the weakened portion, so as to remove 

the cap in one piece. 
A tamper-evident cap according to claim 1, wherein said weakened 
portion comprises a pair of lines of weakness (19a, 19b), circumferentially 

spaced on the skirt (12), with the ring being securely fixed to the skirt 
portion between the lines of weakness. 
A tamper-evident cap according to claim 2, wherein the top (11) 
has a tab (31) defined by a pair of lines of weakness (32,33) associated 

with the lines of weakness (19a,19b) in the skirt (12), so that during 
removal of the cap from a keg spear, the tab (31) is partially detached 

from the top to facilitate removal of the cap. 
A tamper-evident cap according to any preceding claim made as a 
one-piece plastics moulding from polyethylene, or polypropylene.  

 
A tamper-evident cap according to any preceding claim, 
including a label secured to the top of the cap and serving as a dust 

cover. 
A keg spear having attached thereto a cap according to any 
preceding claim, the keg spear having an annular flange and the 

projecting means (13) being snap-engaged over the flange so that the 
cap is rotatably secured on the keg spear with the ring blocking access 

to the interior of the skirt.
