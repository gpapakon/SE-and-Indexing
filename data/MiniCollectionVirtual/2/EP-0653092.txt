<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a platinum/cobalt materials system for use 
in magneto-optical recording, and especially to a system, comprising a plurality of 
platinum/cobalt multilayers, which is suitable for use in direct overwrite operations 
with laser power modulation. Magnetooptical (MO) materials comprising multilayer films of 
platinum and cobalt have not yet reached the stage of commercial production, 
mostly because until recently it had seemed to be impossible to achieve the 
necessary characteristics in a Pt/Co multilayer. It has long been appreciated,  
 
however, that a successful Pt/Co MO material would offer a range of advantages 
over the dominant commercial material, amorphous rare earth transition metal (RE-TM) 
alloy films. European patent application, publication number 0 549 246 A2, 
describes a Pt/Co multilayer film materials system having necessary requirements 
of a MO-recording material, including sufficient room temperature coercivity, Hc, 
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, a square polar Kerr hysteresis loop, and a 
sufficient polar Kerr rotation. Once commercialised, such a Pt/Co system could 
become the dominant commercial product in this field. However, as 
aforementioned, it was thought that the necessary properties could not be achieved 
in a Pt/Co system, and work has continued towards improving RE-TM films. Particularly interesting is the work which has been done towards the 
development of "direct overwrite" (DOW) RE-TM systems. Conventionally, when 
new data is written to MO films, previously-written data is completely erased prior 
to writing of the new data. This two-step process is time-consuming and of course 
a one-step process wherein no separate erasure of previously-written information 
is necessary would be extremely advantageous. No such product has yet been 
made commercially available. One type of laser-power modulated direct overwrite RE-TM film 
which has been investigated typically contains at least two magneto-optic layers 
with separately-controlled magnetic properties; one layer, hereinafter referred to as 
the "memory layer", having a relatively high room temperature coercivity and a 
relatively low Curie temperature is used to store the written data, and the other,  
 
hereinafter referred to as the "reference layer", having a relatively low room 
temperature coercivity and a relatively high Curie temperature. Lin (J. Appl. Phys. 
67 (9), 1 May 1990) discusses the requirements of such a bilayer. The scheme he 
discusses requires two permanent
