<ABSTRACT>

Electromagnetically controlled multipole switch device of 

the contactor type, comprising a casing consisting of a mount 
(S) and a cover (C), inside which is an electromagnet 

consisting of a coil (21) and a magnetic circuit formed by a 
fixed armature (10) and a moving armature (9) fixed to a 

moving-contact holder (16) comprising, for each pole: 

a spring (11) acting on a moving-contact bridge (7, 7′) for 
the purpose of providing contact pressure against 

corresponding fixed contacts (8), either when idle with regard 
to moving break contacts (7) or, with regard to moving make 

contacts (7′), when the coil (21) of the electromagnet (9, 10) 
is energised, and 
a recess affording guiding for the moving contacts (7, 7′),
 
including an ancillary part (A) fixed to the mount (S) of the 

casing, characterised in that the said ancillary part consists 
of a combination of: 


a plate (1) parallel to the base of the said mount (S), on 
which the springs (11) of the moving break contacts (7) rest, 

and 
partitions (2) perpendicular to the plate (1), cooperating 
with the walls of the guide recesses for the contact holder 

(16) and with those of the mount (S) in order to define one 
arc cut-off chamber per pole, and separating the said cut-off 

chambers. 
Switch device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
each recess for the moving-contact holder (16) has only a 

single housing (15) for the moving-contact bridges (7, 7′), 
which are identical, as are the blades of the fixed contacts  

 
(18) and the moving-contact holder (16), for the two versions 

with moving make and break contacts. 
Switch device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the ancillary part (A) forming the arc 

cut-off chambers comprises an opening (C) in the central area 
of the plate (1) affording a passage for a member (20) for 

holding the moving-contact holder (16) in the moving armature 
(9) of the electromagnet, and whose mechanical connection 

becomes effective only when there is a flexing of the said 
moving-contact holder (16) under the effect of the forces of 

the springs (11) or at the time of any welding of the contacts 
(7, 8). 
Switch device according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that the member (20) for holding the moving-contact 

holder (16) takes the form of a dovetail which 
cooperates with a corresponding housing in the moving armature 

(9) of the electromagnet. 
Switch device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the moving-contact holder (16), 

fixed at its two longitudinal ends (18, 18′) remote from the 
base of the mount (S) to manual control arms (19, 19′) for the 

device, constitutes, in association with the latter and with 
the ancillary part (A) defining the arc cut-off chambers and 

the moving armature (9) of the electromagnet, a complete 
subassembly which, at the time of assembly, is placed in the 

relieved areas (13) provided for this purpose in the mount 
(S). 
Switch device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the former (22) of the winding 

(21) of the electromagnet includes damping systems designed to 
damp the shocks caused by the moving armature (9) of the 

electromagnet when it comes to the end of its travel after 
contact with the fixed armature (10).  

 
Switch device according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that it includes, in the vicinity of 

the cover (C), a manual control part (25) provided with an 
operating button (26), connected to the two manual control 

arms (19, 19′) by means of cams (30) having, at their ends, 
two areas (R1, R2) for the said arms (19, 19′) to rest on, for 

which the armatures (9, 10) of the electromagnet are 
respectively in the close or distant position, the said rest 

areas (R1, R2) being connected by an inclined slope (32) 
enabling the movement of the button (26) parallel to the base 

of the mount (S) to be converted into a perpendicular movement 
produced by the moving assembly formed by the moving yoke (9), 

the contact holder (16) and the manual control arms (19, 19′), 
the said inclined slope (32) having an end point (P) only a 

little before the point of rest (R2), where the two armatures 
(9, 10) are in contact, whilst they are at a short distance 

from each other in the position at rest (R2), and in that the 
said part (25) provided with an operating button (26) has at 

least one spring member (27, 27′) designed to exert a 
restoring force towards the point of rest (R1), which is 

exerted when a voltage pulse in the coil (21) of the 
electromagnet brings the two armatures (9,10) into contact.
