<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for tuning a combiner filter. In the invention the measuring signals (Pr1...Prn, PF1...PFn) of a number of different combiner filters are multiplexed to the same detectors (23). Multiplexing allows the measuring and adjusting electronics required by the tuning and adjusting means of combiner filters to be simplified considerably especially with a high number of combiner filters. Multiplexing of measuring signals is used primarily to select the sample signals of the forward and reflected power of one and the same combiner filter to be tuned for the measuring electronics. In the invention selectors (21, 22) for reflected power and forward power are independent of each other, which allows isolation measurement between different channels. The sample signal of the forward power of one combiner filter and the sample signal of the reflected power of another combiner filter are thus connected to the measuring electronics. When both sample signals undergo frequency-selective detection at the same frequency, the degree of isolation between the radio channels will be determined. The invention also relates to a method for performing isolation measurement on radio transmitters isolated by combiner filters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for adjusting
a combiner filter, comprising means for receiving a
first sample signal proportional to forward RF power
to the combiner filter and a second sample signal
proportional to RF power reflected from the combiner
filter; a first frequency-selective detector means for
detecting the magnitude of the forward power by means
of said first sample signal; a second frequency-selective
detector means for detecting the magnitude
of the reflected power by means of said second sample
signal; a control means for adjusting the centre
frequency of the combiner filter in response to the
detection results of the detector means.One known way to connect several radio transmitters
to the same antenna or antenna line is to
connect each radio transmitter through a separate
bandpass filter having its centre frequency tuned to
the transmitting frequency of the radio transmitter.
Such bandpass filters are called combiner filters. The
function of the combiner filter is to feed the transmitting
signal of the respective radio transmitter to
the antenna with the smallest possible losses and
prevent the leakage of transmitting signals of different
frequencies from other radio transmitters, from
the direction of the antenna, to this particular radio
transmitter as efficiently as possible. Conventionally,
combiner bandpass filters are tuned fixedly to the
transmitting frequencies of the radio transmitters. So
it has not been possible to change the transmitting
frequency of the radio transmitter without simultaneously
changing the combiner filter or its tuning.In certain cases, however, it is desirable that
the frequencies of radio transmitters can be changed 
simply and rapidly. One such case is the base station
of a cellular mobile radio system to which predetermined
transmitting and receiving channels have
been assigned. In cases where the channel allocation
of the system can be altered, if desired, by varying
the transmitting and receiving frequencies of the base
stations, the channel capacity of the system can be
utilized in a flexible and efficient way in varying
conditions. Therefore combiner filters have been
developed in which the centre frequency changes automatically
with the transmitting frequency.The adjustment of known automatically tunable
combiner filters is based on measuring RF power
reflected from the input of the filter or RF power
passing through the combiner filter, and on locking to
a minimum/maximum value of the measured power. A
problem with this adjustment method is,
