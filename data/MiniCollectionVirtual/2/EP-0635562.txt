<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil for compression type
refrigerator systems. More particularly, it relates to a lubricating oil for
compression type refrigerator systems having low hygroscopic properties, high
thermal stability, high lubricating properties as well as good miscibility
with refrigerants such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) including
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (hereinafter referred to as R-134a).Generally, a compression type refrigerator system is composed of a
compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporator, having a
mechanism whereby a mixture of a refrigerant and a lubricating oil is
circulating in the closed system. In said compression type refrigerator
system, the temperature in the compressor generally rises to 50째C, while the
temperature can also come to be of -40째C or so, though it depends on the kind
of apparatus. Accordingly, the refrigerant and the lubricating oil must
circulate in this system without phase separation in the usual range of
-40
to +50째C If a phase separation occurs while the refrigerator system is
running, it seriously affects the life and efficiency of the apparatus. For
example, if phase separation of the refrigerant and the lubricating oil
occurs in the compressor, the moving parts would be inadequately lubricated,
resulting in seizure or other troubles, and thereby the life of apparatus
would be shortened considerably. If phase separation occurs in the
evaporator, the viscosity of the lubricating oil increases and thereby the
efficiency of heat exchange is decreased.Since a lubricating oil for refrigerator systems is used for the purpose of
lubricating the moving parts of the refrigerator system, its lubricating
properties are also important as a matter of course. Since the temperature
becomes very high, particularly in the compressor, the oil is required to
have a sufficient viscosity to retain the oil film necessary for lubricating.
The necessary viscosity varies with the kind of operating conditions of the
compressor, but usually, the kinematic viscosity of the lubricating oil
before mixing with a refrigerant is preferably 2 to 50 cSt at 100째C. If the
kinematic viscosity is lower than the above, the oil film becomes thinner and 
thereby seizure is liable to arise, while if it is higher, the efficiency of
heat exchange is decreased.Heretofore, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) including dichlorodifluoromethane
(hereinafter referred to as R-12) has often been used as the refrigerant for
compression type refrigerator systems, and various
