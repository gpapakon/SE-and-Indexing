<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power resistor cooled by natural convection including at least one resistive strip (43) arranged in a casing providing for its support and supporting the electrical connections to the strip, the support of the resistive strip being achieved by means of support combs holding the resistive strip by its longitudinal edges, characterised in that the casing consists only of two flanges (31, 32) spaced apart by at least a part of the support combs (33, 34).

Power resistor cooled by natural convection 
including at least one resistive strip (43, 44) disposed in a 

box section constituted of two flanges (31, 32) supporting 
said resistive strip through the intermediary of support comb 

assemblies and supporting electrical connections to said 
resistive strip; characterised in that: 


said box section is spaced apart by only some of said 
support comb assemblies (33, 34, 35), the other support comb 

assemblies (37, 38, 45) being mounted floating between said 
flanges so that the flanges are not deformed due to thermal 

expansion transmitted through the support comb assemblies, all 
of said support comb assemblies (33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 45) 

holding said resistive strip by its longitudinal edges 
disposed between the teeth (4) of insulative comb members (1) 

mounted on said support comb assemblies. 
Resistor according to claim 1 characterised in that 
it includes two stacked resistive strips (43, 44) separated by 

common support comb assemblies (45). 
Resistor according to claim 2 characterised in that 
a common support comb assembly (45) includes a cylindrical 

insulative comb member (61, 62) with an axial hole through it 
in which is inserted a rod (63) supported at opposite ends by 

the flanges (31, 32) of the box section. 
Resistor according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that each resistive strip is bent into a zigzag. 
Resistor according to claim 4 characterised in that 
said strip is constituted of metal elements with one or more 

bends welded together end to end to constitute the strip. 
Resistor according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that each resistive strip is a thick strip. 
Resistor according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that the flanges have insulative bushes (56)  

 
on the inside of the box section. 
Resistor according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that the flanges have lugs (53, 54, 55) for 

fixing the box section. 
Resistor according to any one of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that the electrical connections (46, 47) are 

fixed to the flanges by means of insulators (48, 49, 52). 
Resistor according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the flanges (31, 32) incorporate 

ventilation holes (58).
