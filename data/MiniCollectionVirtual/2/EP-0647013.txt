<ABSTRACT>
The control system provides for the synchronization of at least one 
operating element (125) that has a desired relationship relative to a 

movable element (115). The movable element (115) is set into motion in 
a prescribed and controlled manner. A reference signal (200) is derived 

from the movable element (115) such that the reference signal (200) is 
representative of the position of movable element (115). This reference 

signal (200) can represent either the absolute position or relative 
position of the movable element (115). This reference signal (200) is 

applied to the input of a programmable element (2). The programmable 
element (2) processes this reference signal (200) to generate control 

signal(s) (230) for the desired control state of the operating 
element(s) (125). The control signal(s) (230), either 

directly or indirectly, 
control the operating element(s) (125).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for synchronizing
the operation of multiple elements of a system to the motion of a
movable element using a programmable element as the control
element according to the preamble of claims 1 and 10,
respectively, as known from GB 2089072.The present invention relates to the refinement of the control of
multiple operating elements where a movable element is used as
the reference for synchronizing all other operating elements
within the system.In previously implemented motion control systems synchronization
was performed through analog methods or a discretely implemented
state machine as opposed to a programmable element.Analog methods previously used were susceptible to electrical
noise, and as such produced errors in position and velocity.
Initial analog implementations controlled the velocities of each
axis but did nothing to control the relative position of the
axes.The use of a hardware based state machine for this application
was driven in part from the synchronization requirement. The
state machine approach provides synchronization. This
implementation is typically unwieldy, complex and lacks
versatility. This approach usually produced circuitry that was in
many cases redundant, used multiple unsynchronized timing
references, and the completed design lacked flexibility such that
it was not easily modified for use on subsequent designs. Since the advent of programmable elements, their inherent ability
to be programmed made them seem ideal as a replacement for the
state machine. They would then allow for rapid development, low
cost, and enhanced flexibility over the hardware state machine
previously mentioned. Unfortunately, synchronization between a
movable element and the crystal oscillator clock of the
programmable element could not be assured.US 5055756 describes a traverse apparatus and an image recording
apparatus including a rotary member for traversing a material to
be traversed, a storage unit for prestoring rotation control data
based on diameter data corresponding to a rotation angle of the
rotary member from a reference position in its circumferential
direction, a detection unit for detecting the rotation angle of
the rotary member, and a control unit for controlling an angular
velocity of the rotary member on the basis of an output from the
detection unit and a content of the storage unit so as to make a
traverse velocity of the material to be traversed constant.It is, accordingly, a general object of the invention to provide
a method and
