<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
automatic placement of nodes in a graph based diagram (net diagram) representing a technical system including a logic
diagram, a process diagram, a relational tree diagram, a
layout of a printed circuit board.For a conventional schematic generator,
various proposals have been presented. For example,
articles of such proposals have been described in the
JP-A-61-204775, "A Method of Generating a Logic Diagram"
in the Technical Report CAS84-134 published in 1984 from
the Institute or Electronics and Communication Engineers
of Japan, an article entilted "A Visibility Oriented Construction System for LOGIC diagrams", in SYSTEMS and COMPUTERS in JAPAN, VOL 17 NO 7, July 86, pages 40-48, T. Hasegawa et al., the JP-A-60-205672, and the JP-A-60-176177.In an ordinary schematic generator, an entire
logic circuit is subdivided through a logic division such
that for each subdivided portion, arrangement of diagram
drawing symbols of respective circuit parts and the like
are determined in the subdivided constituent circuit 
through an automatic placement or placement. Routings
between the circuit parts are determined through an
automatic routing. In another ordinary schematic
generator, the circuit parts are arranged so as to be
thereafter divided, thereby generating a logic circuit
diagram. These methods produces a clear diagram primarily
by subdividing a logic circuit diagram in an effective
fashion, by employing a hierarchic representation of the
logic circuit diagram, or by using properties of
particular circuit parts other than the connective
relationships between the circuit parts.Moreover, conventionally, according to a method
of arranging circuit parts of a logical circuit diagram in
the schematic generating method, locations in which
drawing symbols are allocatable are limited to positions
defined by assuming a checkerboard or grid on the
objective diagram. The placements are then sequentially
determined beginning from an end of the diagram in a fixed
direction (for example, from an output side to an input
side or in a reverse direction thereto) according to the
connective relationships between the drawings symbols
(namely, between the circuit parts). In a procedure to
decide the placements, each drawing symbols are assigned
with a level (namely, a column for placement or placement)
based on the connective relationships with an input
terminal (or an input port) or an output terminal (or an
output port) set as a start point or an initial point.
Subsequently,

<CLAIMS>
A node placement method for automatic placement of nodes
in a graph based diagram representing a technical system, said diagram having levels assigned to its nodes, said method including a step (12) of determining

positional relationships between a plurality of nodes in one level and
not directly connected with each other in the

diagram, said method characterized in that said step
includes;


a substep (101) of determining all possible node
pairs among said plurality of nodes;
a substep (102) of regarding arcs as parent
child relationships, detecting one of a common ancestor

node and a common descendant node for each of said node
pairs, determining for each of said node pairs the level difference and the total number of arcs from the node pair's nodes

to said common ancestor node or said
common decendant node;
a substep (104) of determining a priority
sequence among said node pairs, said priority sequence

comprising assigning a higher priority to each one of
said node pairs which has a respective one of a smaller

value of said total number of arcs or a smaller
value of said level difference; and
a substep (105) of determining the positional
relationships between said plurality of nodes so that

those of said node pairs that have higher priorities are
located closer to each other.
