<ABSTRACT>
A polytetrafluoroethylene porous film which is suitable for trapping suspended fine particles in a gas such as 
air usable in a clean room widely used in a semi-conductor industry and so forth and is superior as an air filter having 

a small pressure loss, and a method for manufacturing a polytetrafluoroethylene porous film having an average pore 
diameter ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 µm and a pressure loss of 20 to 50 mm H₂O when allowing air to permeate it at 

a flow rate of 5.3 cm/sec by stretching a non-baked polytetrafluoroethylene body in two axial directions at a specific 
temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a porous film comprising 
polytetrafluoroethylene (referred to as "PTFE" hereinafter). 
More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a process for preparing a porous PTFE film which is excellent as an 
air filter medium, particularly an ULPA filter medium which Is used 
for cleaning internal atmospheres in clean rooms in the semiconductor 
industry and In productive facilities of precision electronic 
instruments, medicines, biochemicals, etc., and as a liquid filter 
medium. Recent semiconductor, precision and biotechnology industries 
require completely cleaned air or highly cleaned chemicals in their 
manufacturing processes. Particularly, the internal atmosphere of the 
equipment in the semiconductor industry is required to be highly 
cleaned with the development to high integration of semiconductors. 
The cleaned air is now obtained by filtering a circulating air through 
an air filter. The chemicals used in the semiconductor industry are 
also needed to be highly cleaned. Their cleaning is effected by filtering a 
circulating chemical through a filter. Various filters used for such purposes are hitherto 
proposed and practically used. An example of the air filters mainly 
used now is a filter medium prepared by making paper using a mixture  
 
of glass fiber and a binder. However such a filter medium has 
several disadvantages, for example, existence of microfibers attached 
thereto, occurrence of self-dust during folding it in processing or 
occurrence of dust due to deterioration of the glass fiber and the 
binder by contact with certain chemicals such as hydrogen fluoride, 
etc. An electret filter medium of a synthetic fiber is proposed to 
solve such problems (see JP-A-54053365). 
However, it is found that the electrostatic force generated in the 
electret filter medium is masked to lose its effect when it collects 
microparticles and its collection effect is thus lowered (see the 11th 
Air Cleaning and Contamination Control Research Congress, pages 153 - 
156). Thus, in order to avoid the disadvantage, auxiliary use of a 
porous stretched PTFE film is proposed to obtain a cleaned atmosphere 
(see JP-A-4010364 and JP-A-2284614 (EP-A-0395331)). In these proposals, porous PTFE films having pore sizes of not 
less than 1 µm are used to prevent the increase of pressure drop. The 
reason why floating particles in air having smaller sizes than the pore 
size of the film can be captured by the film is found to be based on the 
below

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a porous polytetrafluoroethylene 
film from an 

unsintered polytetrafluoroethylene tape, which is obtained by 
paste extruding a polytetrafluoroethylene fine powder and then 

rolling it, comprising the steps of stretching the tape lengthwise 
at a temperature of from 250 to 320°C, and 

subsequently stretching the tape crosswise at a temperature of from 100 
to 200°C. 
A process according to Claim 1, in which the stretching 
is carried out in a stretched area ratio of at least 100. 
A process according to Claim 1, in which the stretched 
film is not heat set at a temperature above the melting point 

of polytetrafluoroethylene. 
A process according to Claim 1, further comprising 
laminating a porous reinforcing material on at least one side 

of the stretched film. 
A process according to Claim 4, wherein the porous 
reinforcing material is laminated to the stretched film before 

the crosswise stretched film is wound up.
