<ABSTRACT>
An injection moulding apparatus has a plasticizing space 
(3) formed in a substantial cone or disk shape between a 

heating cylinder (1) and a screw (2), into which moulding 
resin is introduced. The moulding resin in the 

plasticizing space (3) can be maintained in its uniformly 
plasticized state by continuously rotating the screw 

during injection moulding operation, thus increasing the 
efficiency of injection moulding. The heating cylinder 

(1) and screw (2) can be readily be assembled because the 
heating surface (11) of the heating cylinder and the 

plasticizing surface (21) of the screw are formed in a 
substantial cone or disk shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection moulding apparatus
having a unique plasticizing structure capable of
constantly maintaining moulding resin in its uniformly
plasticized state, thereby to produce moulded articles of
high quality.There has been so far widely used an in-line screw type
injection moulding apparatus having a rotating screw
movable back and forth in a heating cylinder. Molding
material supplied into a plasticizing space defined
between the inner surface of the heating cylinder and the
circumferential surface of the screw is plasticized with
not only the heat essentially generated by the heating
cylinder but also shearing calorific stress caused by the
rotation of the screw. While feeding out the plasticized
material toward the cylinder head, the rotating screw is
forced backward by the reaction of the moulding material.
Then, the screw stops rotating and thrust forward to
inject the plasticized moulding material from the cylinder
into a mould.In the conventional injection moulding apparatus of this
type, the plasticizing space between the inner heating
surface of the heating cylinder and the outer surface of
the screw is formed in the shape of a thin tube extending
parallel with the axis of the cylinder.In the conventional moulding apparatus, the tubular
plasticizing space formed in the heating cylinder and
extending parallel with the axis of the cylinder entails
various problems as described below.The unit constituted by the heating cylinder and screw in
the conventional moulding apparatus necessitates a rather
long plasticizing passage for the moulding material in
order to uniformly plasticize the moulding material and 
allow the screw to sufficiently move back and forth in the
cylinder. Thus, the conventional moulding apparatus is
inevitably complicated in structure and made large in
size. In particular, as the screw having a feed zone,
plasticization zone, and metering zone is necessarily made
long, the heating cylinder and injection mechanism in the
conventional apparatus become long. As one example, the
injection mechanism capable of exerting a mould clamping
force of 25 tons has generally a length of about 350 mm to
400 mm, and that capable of exerting a moulding clamping
force of 200 tons becomes as long as about 1000 mm to 1500
mm in length.Furthermore, the plasticizing space between the heating
cylinder and the screw must be narrowed down to less than
0.02 mm in general in order to allow the screw to move
back and forth without degrading plasticizing efficiency.
However, the
