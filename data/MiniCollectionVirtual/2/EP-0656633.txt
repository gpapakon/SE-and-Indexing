<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a reactor vessel (1) of a boiling water reactor with a reactor jacket (2), a double-walled, cupola-shaped closure head (3) and an emergency cooling device (10). The emergency cooling device (10) has a first spray distributor (4) which is distributed over the internal wall (3a) of the closure head (3), and a second spray distributor (5) which is largely arranged in a plane (8) perpendicular to a main axis (7) of the core jacket (2), on the internal wall (3a). The invention further relates to a method for upgrading a reactor vessel (1) which has an irradiated core jacket (2) and an emergency cooling device (10), a further, more diverse spray distributor (5) being added to a spray distributor (4) which already exists and is arranged on the internal wall (3a) of the closure head (3).
