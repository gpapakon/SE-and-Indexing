<ABSTRACT>
Level-off DP cellulose which can be disaggregated in aqueous suspension on exposure to mechanical forces to give microcrystalline cellulose is prepared by partial hydrolysis of cellulose in such a way that the cellulose is partially hydrolysed in a pressure reactor with water under a gas pressure of 0.1 to 60 bar of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, measured at 20 DEG C, at a temperature of 100 to 200 DEG C until the levelling-off DP is reached. The partial hydrolysis is preferably carried out under a gas pressure of 0.5 to 30 bar, measured at 20 DEG C, and in a temperature range of 140 to 180 DEG C.
