<ABSTRACT>
An image processing circuit (16) which adds, by means of 
a yellow color image data, forgery tracing information to 

yellow, magenta and cyan color image data obtained by reading 
out of an original (12). A tracing information adder replaces 

the read-out yellow color image data with a yellow color 
image of a higher density in a low-density area where the 

density of the read-out yellow color image data is equal to 
or below a set threshold value (30). In a high-density area 

where the density of the read-out yellow color image data 
exceeds the set threshold value (30), the tracing information 

is added by adding a predetermined value B to the read-out 
yellow color image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing 
circuit for use in a digital full-color electrographic copying 
machine having a forgery preventing function. In recent years, digital color electrographic copying 
machines have been spreading, and most of them are used for 
beneficial purposes. However, since anyone can easily obtain a 
copy with a high resolution and an excellent color reproducibility 
because of the improvement in performance of such copying 
machines, the forgery of bank notes, which is a serious crime, 
may easily be committed. For this reason, manufactures of copying machines of this 
type enables tracing with respect to a copy (i.e. the tracing of 
the copying machine with which the original is copied and of the 
date of the copying) in order to prevent to the utmost the 
forgery of bank notes which is a crime exerting a great influence 
on society. Specifically, when an original is copied, 
tracing information such as the machine number of the copying 
machine and the date of the copying are added to the copy of the 
original. In order that the image other than the added information 
is not damaged due to the addition of such tracing information, 
it is necessary to add the information at a density where 
the information cannot visually be recognized. For this reason, 
a tracing information adding method is employed using a yellow  
 
color image data which is difficult to visually recognize. In such a tracing information adding method, when tracing 
information is added by adding a yellow color image data of a 
predetermined density (this density should be as low as possible 
so that visual recognition is impossible), for example at a low 
density portion (white portion) where there is hardly any yellow 
color image data, the density of the added tracing information 
is too low, so that it may be impossible to read out the 
information from forged bank notes by a color scanner. Therefore, 
a way to solve this problem is desired. In the above-described method of adding tracing information, 
in order to further decrease the influence on the reproduced 
image by the addition of the tracing information, it is 
desired that the tracing information is added uniformly to the 
entire image. In this case, the ratio of the area of the added 
tracing information to the area of the reproduced image is 
necessarily fixed. That is, the ratio of the area of the 
tracing information to the area of the reproduced image is 
necessarily fixed even if the contents of the tracing information
