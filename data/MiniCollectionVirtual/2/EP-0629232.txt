<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel additive composition. More
particularly, this invention relates to a fuel additive
composition containing a poly(oxyalkylene) hydroxyaromatic
ester and an aliphatic amine.It is well known that automobile engines tend to form
deposits on the surface of engine components, such as
carburetor ports, throttle bodies, fuel injectors, intake
ports and intake valves, due to the oxidation and
polymerization of hydrocarbon fuel. These deposits, even
when present in relatively minor amounts, often cause
noticeable driveability problems, such as stalling and poor
acceleration. Moreover, engine deposits can significantly
increase an automobile's fuel consumption and production of
exhaust pollutants. Therefore, the development of effective
fuel detergents or "deposit control" additives to prevent or
control such deposits is of considerable importance and
numerous such materials are known in the art.For example, aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenols are
known to reduce engine deposits when used in fuel
compositions. U.S. Patent No. 3,849,085, issued
November 19, 1974 to Kreuz et al., discloses a motor fuel
composition comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons in the 
gasoline boiling range containing about 0.01 to 0.25 volume
percent of a high molecular weight aliphatic
hydrocarbon-substituted phenol in which the aliphatic
hydrocarbon radical has an average molecular weight in the
range of about 500 to 3,500. This patent teaches that
gasoline compositions containing minor amount of an
aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol not only prevent or
inhibit the formation of intake valve and port deposits in a
gasoline engine, but also enhance the performance of the
fuel composition in engines designed to operate at higher
operating temperatures with a minimum of decomposition and
deposit formation in the manifold of the engine.Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,134,846, issued January 16,
1979 to Machleder et al., discloses a fuel additive
composition comprising a mixture of (1) the reaction product
of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol,
epichlorohydrin and a primary or secondary mono- or
polyamine, and (2) a polyalkylene phenol. This patent
teaches that such compositions show excellent carburetor,
induction system and combustion chamber detergency and, in
addition, provide effective rust inhibition when used in
hydrocarbon fuels at low concentrations.U.S. Patent No. 4,231,759 discloses a fuel additive
composition comprising the Mannich condensation product of
(1) a high molecular weight
