<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to imageable articles capable of producing multi-color 
images by dye diffusion. In particular, this invention relates to silver-based 
photothermographic materials employing oxidizable leuco dyes. Imaging systems capable of producing multiple colors often rely upon barrier 
interlayers to separate adjacent imaging chemistries. In some cases, such as those in 
which a dye image is formed and diffused to a receiving layer, the interlayer must not 
only separate imaging chemistries, but must be permeable to dyes as well. Dry 
silver-based imageable articles are one type of imaging system that may employ 
interlayers in this manner. Dry silver compositions are photothermographic compositions and contain a 
light-insensitive, reducible silver source; a light-sensitive silver source; and a 
reducing agent for the light-insensitive, reducible silver source. The light-sensitive 
material is generally photographic silver halide (e.g., silver chloride), which must be 
in catalytic proximity to the light-insensitive, reducible silver source (e.g., silver 
behenate). Catalytic proximity requires an intimate physical association of these two 
materials so that when silver specks or nuclei are generated by the irradiation or light 
exposure of the photographic silver halide, those nuclei are able to catalyze the 
reduction of the light-insensitive, reducible silver source by the reducing agent. It has 
been long understood that light exposed silver halide is a catalyst for the reduction 
of silver ions and the silver-generating, light-sensitive silver halide catalyst progenitor 
may be placed into catalytic proximity with the silver source in a number of different 
fashions, such as for example, by partial metathesis of the reducible silver source 
with a halogen-containing source and coprecipitation of silver halide and light-insensitive, 
reducible silver source material. In both photographic and photothermographic emulsions, exposure of the 
photographic silver halide to light produces small clusters of silver atoms. The  
 
image-wise distribution of these clusters is known in the art as a latent image. As 
this latent image generally is not visible by ordinary means, the light-sensitive article 
must be further processed in order to produce a visual image. The visual image is 
produced by the catalytic reduction of silver ions which are in catalytic proximity to 
the silver halide grains bearing the latent image. In color dry silver imaging systems, a leuco dye is typically incorporated
