<ABSTRACT>
A process for purifying organically polluted water, e.g. for obtaining drinking water, entails the untreated water being vigorously mixed with ozone in an ozone-treatment unit (2) and subsequently being passed through a filter (4) which is composed of different layers. To optimise the film of microorganisms which forms in the filter, sulphur is metered in, in the form of a compound which is available for assimilation by microorganisms, e.g. a sulphide, between the ozone-treatment unit (2) and the filter (4). The filter (4) preferably consists of an upper layer of filter carbon and an underlying layer of fine sand. Suitable and preferred as assimilable sulphur compound is aqueous sodium sulphide solution (3) or else hydrogen sulphide, sodium sulphite or sodium thiosulphate. An ozone treatment at the end of the process ensures that any traces of bioavailable sulphur are oxidised to the sulphate form.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the treatment of organic-laden water, e.g. for
the purpose of obtaining drinking water, whereby the

untreated water is intensively mixed with ozone in an ozone
treatment unit and is then directed through a filter

(fixed-bed reactor) composed of different layers,
characterised in that sulphur in the form of a compound

available for assimilation by means of microorganisms, e.g.
a sulphide, is added in metered doses between the ozone

treatment unit (2) and the filter (4).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
filter (4) has an upper coarse filter layer consisting of

filter carbon and a layer of fine sand located below this.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that an
aqueous sodium sulphide solution is added in metered doses.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that hydrogen
sulphide or sodium sulphite or sodium thiosulphate is added

in metered doses.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that a

treatment (5) of the water with ozone is performed to
conclude the process in order to oxidise any bioavailable

sulphur, e.g. sulphide, possibly still present into the
sulphate form.
