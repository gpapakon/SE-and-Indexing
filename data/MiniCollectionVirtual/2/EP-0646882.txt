<ABSTRACT>
A method for accessing a data item from a data base has the full data base 
contained in a plurality of blocks in a slow background memory and furthermore has a 

faster foreground memory. Each data item has a label containing one or more elements. 
The data base furthermore has an index containing a second multiplicity of treewise 

organized index items each comprising an initial part of its label header, one or more 
secondary pointers and an indication of whether all data items having that initial part are 

contained in only one or in a plurality of blocks. First the index is accessed with the 
initial part of the label. If the index item pertaining to the latter initial part signals said 

being contained in only a single block, the pointer in that index item points to that 
single block and the block is stored in the foreground memory. Extending the initial 

part to a full header identifies an intended subset of data items for accessing through its 
completed label. If the data items having the initial part are contained in a plurality of 

blocks, the pointer of the current index item points to a further index item of the tree 
having the current initial part extended by a next successor label element, whereupon 

the process repeats for the extended label header.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for accessing a particular subset of data items
from among a multiplicity of data items of a data base contained in a relatively slow
background memory, each data item comprising a string of label elements. Accessing of data
bases is an old art. The new media of CD-ROM and the like have made the physical carrier
containing such data base readily portable, and therefore, many non-computer environments
have been found to benefit from the accessibility of such data bases. The prime disadvantage
of CD-ROM based systems is the relatively slow accessibility of the disc itself as viewed
against the huge data storage therein; in particular for relatively inexpensive versions for
widespread consumer use. Access time to a particular data item directly from a CD-ROM may
be in the range of 0.5 seconds if only a single disc is present, which is relatively high in
regards to human keying speed. A particular field of use of the present invention is for
accessing geographical data bases in the physical environment of a motor car.US Patent 4,468,728 describes a data structure for searching a stored record on
a storage medium. The data structure is arranged as a plurality of search trees, organized in a
hierarchical way. This allows one or more initial search trees to be stored in relatively fast
foreground memory.Japanese Abstract JP 5 020 154 describes the usage of a tree structure with
blocks to speed up the access to a file. The addresses of the lowest blocks are stored at each
level of the hierarchy in the tree.Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to
provide an improved access mechanism to such data base through the provision of a relatively
small but fast foreground memory, and through an appropriate strategy for the access, in
particular for arriving at an improved strategy for determining when a part of the data base
must be transferred to the foreground memory. Thereto, according to one of its aspects, the
invention provides said data base comprising a sequence of blocks together containing said 
data items and furthermore comprising an index containing a second multiplicity of treewise
organized index items each comprising an initial part of a label header of an associated subset
of data items, one or more pointers and an indication of whether all data items associated to
that initial part are contained in only a single said block or in a plurality of said blocks.
The method of using the database comprises the steps of:
storing said index in a relatively fast

A method for accessing a particular subset of data items from among a
multiplicity of data items of a data base contained in a relatively slow background

memory, each data item comprising a string of label elements, and said data base
comprising a sequence of blocks together containing said data items and furthermore

comprising an index containing a second multiplicity of treewise organized index items
each comprising an initial part of a label header of an associated subset of data items,

one or more pointers and an indication of whether all data items associated to that initial
part are contained in only a single said block or in a plurality of said blocks, said

method comprising the steps of:

storing said index in a relatively fast foreground memory;
with respect to said index detecting of a particular such initial part being called;
then upon finding with respect to the latter initial part said being contained in only a
single block, reading the pointer contained in said index item as primary pointer to an

associated single block and storing that block in said foreground memory while enabling
extending said initial part to a full header for identifying said associated subset, and

accessing such subset through its eventually completed label;
but upon finding with respect to the latter initial part said being contained in a
plurality of blocks reading any pointer contained in said index item as secondary pointer

to a further index item of said tree having the current initial part extended by a next
successor label element while enabling selective extending of the current initial part by

such next successor label element.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, and comprising upon detecting
extending by an incongruous element an error signalizing step.
An apparatus for accessing a particular subset of data items from among a
multiplicity of data items each provided with a string of label elements of a data base,

said apparatus containing a relatively slow background memory with first access means
and having said data base that comprises a sequence of storage blocks containing said

data items and furthermore an index containing a second multiplicity of treewise 
organized index items each comprising an initial part of a label header of an associated subset of data items, one or more

pointers and an indication of whether all data items pertaining to that initial part are
contained in only a single said block or in a plurality of said blocks, said apparatus

comprising:

a relatively fast foreground memory with second access means;
control means for activating said first access means for storing said index in said
foreground memory;
first detecting means for detecting a particular such initial part being called;
second detecting means for detecting with respect to the latter initial part said being
contained in only a single block, and thereupon under control of a pointer contained in

said index item accessing the associated single block and storing that block in said
foreground memory while enabling extending said initial part to a full header of a

subset of data item identified thereby and thereupon activating second accessing means
for accessing such identified subset of data items;
but for upon finding with respect to the latter initial part said being contained in a
plurality of blocks reading any pointer contained in said index item to a further index

element while enabling selective extending of the current initial part by such next

successor label element.

A data carrier comprising data defining a data base for use in a method or apparatus as claimed
in any of the Claims 1 to 4, the data base comprising a sequence of blocks, each block

an initial part of a label,
a pointer, and
