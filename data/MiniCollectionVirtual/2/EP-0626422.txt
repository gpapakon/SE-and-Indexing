<ABSTRACT>
A flame retarded rubber modified graft 
copolymer composition is provided which easily 

yields dark colored composition. The composition 
comprises an antimony sulfide compound as a flame 

retardant synergist and either a halogen 
containing rubber modified graft copolymer or a 

combination of a rubber modified graft copolymer 
and a halogen containing compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to graft 
copolymer compositions, and more particularly 
relates to fire retardant graft copolymer 
compositions containing an antimony synergist. Fire retardant thermoplastic compositions 
comprising an antimony synergist are known, see 
Kamiyama et al U.S. Patent 4155949 issued May 22, 
1979, Yoshitaki et al U.S. Patent 3981843 issued 
September 21, 1976, Kirsch et al U.S. Patent 
4731405 issued March 15, 1988, and Furukawa et al 
U.S. Patent 3852393 issued December 3, 1974, all 
of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
In view of the above references, fire retardant 
thermoplastic compositions comprising (i) either 
a halogenated thermoplastic or a thermoplastic 
and a halogen containing additive with (ii) an 
antimony oxide synergist are well known. 
Disclosed thermoplastics include acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
(ABS) graft copolymers and 
halogenated thermoplastics containing 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers. While antimony trioxide is an effective 
synergist for flame-retardant ABS compositions, 
its presence in such composition, due to its 
being a white pigment of high tint strength, 
requires that in order to provide dark color 
compositions, high levels of carbon black and/or 
other dark pigments be added. Such high levels  
 
of carbon black and/or other pigments can result 
in the impairment of certain physical properties 
such as fire-retardancy. Antimony sulfides have 
previously been used in polymeric compositions 
other than ABS resins as a flame retardant 
additive and as a pigment. Consequently, there is a need for flame-retardant 
ABS resin composition containing an 
antimony synergist which can be made into dark 
resin compositions with reduced levels of carbon 
black and/or other dark pigments. The present invention involves flame-regardant 
rubber modified graft copolymer 
compositions comprising an antimony sulfide 
synergist. The antimony sulfides are black and 
allow for dark resin formulations without using 
high levels of carbon black and/or other dark 
pigments. The flame retardant thermoplastic composition 
of the present invention comprises (a) (i) a 
halogen containing rubber modified graft 
copolymer, or (ii) a halogen-free rubber modified 
graft copolymer and a halogen containing 
hydrocarbon, and (b) an antimony sulfide compound 
present in an amount sufficient to enhance the 
flame retardancy of the composition. The 
compositions may further contain carbon black 
and/or other dark pigments. Preferably the 
antimony
