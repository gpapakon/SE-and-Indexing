<ABSTRACT>
A rail-laying train for loading, transporting and unloading long railway rails (5) is equipped with wagon frames supported on rail travelling mechanisms and with rail supports (6) which run perpendicularly to the wagon longitudinal direction and are equipped with rollers provided for storing the long railway rails (5). These rollers are designed as flanged rollers (9) with a flange (14) arranged at the end.

A rail loading train for transporting and for loading 
and unloading long rails (5), comprising wagon frames (3) 

supported on on-track undercarriages (2) and rail supports 
(6), extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction 

of the wagon, with rollers provided for supporting the long 
rails (5) and, if appropriate, vertically extending spacer 

bars (13) located between said rollers, characterized in that 
in order to support a long rail (5) there are arranged two 

flanged rollers (9), positioned one behind the other in the 
transverse direction of the wagon or rails and spaced apart 

from one another, in each case forming a roller pair (15), 
the flange (14) being provided in each case on the opposite 

end to the mutually adjacent ends (16). 
A rail loading train according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a roller bearin
g shaft (8) bearing the flanged 
rollers (9) arranged one behind the other in the transverse 

direction of the wagon is supported by a plurality of shaft 
bearings (12), each positioned between the flanged rollers 

(9) of a roller pair (15). 
A rail loading train according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the width of the spacer bar (13), 

extending in the transverse direction of the wagon, is 
designed to correspond approximately to the width of two 

flanges (14) located beneath the spacer bar (13). 
A rail loading train according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the difference between the diameter 

of the flanged roller (9) and that of the flange (14) is 
designed to correspond to the height of a rail base, i.e. 

about 10 to 15 mm.  
 
A rail loading train according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that provided on each roller bearing shaft 

(8) of the rail support (6) are a total of twenty flanged 
rollers (9), arranged one behind the other, for supporting a 

total of ten long rails (5). 
A rail loading train according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the spacer bar (13) is in each case 

arranged above two adjacent flanges (14) of two flanged 
rollers (9).
