<ABSTRACT>
A composite sandwich panel structure having first and second honeycomb core layers and 
fire barrier membranes separating the honeycomb core layers as well as forming facing 

skins provides protection from burn-through after 15 minutes of subjection to a 1093°C 
(2000°F) front side flame impingement at 120 kW/m²(10.5 btu/ft² sec) heat flux density, 

with a 43°C (110°F) average off-surface temperature 305 mm (12'') off of the backside of 
the panel. The facing skins on the outside of the honeycomb core layers are preferably 

formed by a layer of vermiculite film together with a layer phenolic prepreg. The center 
septum layer separating the first and second honeycomb core layers can be an inorganic 

fiber membrane, with a layer of phenolic prepreg on both sides thereof, and/or a layer of 
vermiculite film or other suitable materials providing a fire barrier. The honeycomb core 

layers are preferably made of a nylon paper honeycomb having a coating that itself forms 
a fire barrier, such as a coating of 80-96% sodium silicate, 1-4% vermiculite HTS and 

2-15% H₂O based phenolic resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composite sandwich panels employing honeycomb cores, 
and in particular relates to such composite panels designed to be used in environments 
requiring fire or flame resistance, or fire protection. Standard low FST (Flame, Smoke and Toxicity) composite panel structures are normally 
made of phenolic prepreg skins on Nomex® honeycomb core. An example of this can be 
found in Applicant's own U.S. Patent No. 4,956,217. This patent provides a laminate 
structure that comprises a honeycomb core structure with facing sheets bonded thereto, 
the core being treated with a silica impregnant/coating to impart improved flame 
resistance and to reduce heat transmission and toxic emissions upon exposure of the core 
to direct or indirect heat, flame and/or a pirolytic environment. The use of the honeycomb 
core combined with rigid skin panels forms a sandwich structure providing semi-structural 
strength. In addition, this patent provides a honeycomb composite structure that exhibits 
excellent heat and flame barrier properties, while still retaining adequate mechanical 
strength. U.S. Patent 4,251,579 to Lee et al. discloses an alternate fire protection panel, wherein the 
cells of a honeycomb core are filled with a fire-extinguishing fluid. Thus, any projectiles 
impacting and passing through the facing sheets would cause the fire-extinguishing fluid 
to be rapidly liberated to suppress or extinguish any fire caused by entry of the projectile. U.S. Patent 5,106,668 to Turner et al. provides a multi-layer honeycomb core structure 
having a plurality of core layers of different densities and thicknesses. The emphasis in 
this patent is the maintenance of a low mass density while providing good strength in 
resistance to compressive bending stresses and high resistance to damage from drops or 
other impacts, as well as resistance to water ingression. U.S. patent 4,937,125 to Sanmartin et al. provides another multi-layer core sandwich 
structure that is resistant to both impact and thermal aggressions. A synthetic cellular 
material having a low thermal conductivity coefficient provides one layer, while another  
 
layer is made up of an off-the-shelf extruded polystyrene polyvinylchloride, or polyethene 
plate. However, none of the above provides a composite sandwich panel that provides a 15 
minute burn-through protection at 120 kW/m² (10.5 btu/ft²·sec) heat flux density at 
1093°C (2000°F). An initial object of the present invention is to provide a composite sandwich panel 
structure
