<ABSTRACT>
A blade sharpener for a pocket knife (25) is in the form of an 
appendage which can be removably secured to the knife handle (33) and 

which carries a superabrasive layer sharpening surface (23), such as an 
electroplated diamond grit. The appendage may take the form of a 

pair of tweezers (1), such as those commonly found on Swiss army type 
knives, with the superabrasive layer being attached to its inside 

surfaces (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cutlery combined with a sharpening 
feature, and more particularly to a superabrasive sharpening device 
which is compact, highly durable, and can easily be carried with 
and secured to a pocket knife. The effective and safe use of a knife requires occasional 
sharpening to maintain a keen edge. For a knife which is used at 
a single location, a sharpening device, such as a whetstone or a 
sharpening steel can be conveniently stored nearby. For a knife 
which is carried about, the carrying along of a separate sharpening 
device can be inconvenient, since the device can be bulky if it is 
a stone or can be easily lost if it is a smaller item, such as a 
tungsten carbide or ceramic device. For this reason, some knives 
designed for carrying have a sharpening device stored in or built 
into a sheath. The sharpening surface can be a feature of the 
sheath because the sheath can be moved relative to the knife. This 
is not the case for folding knives, since they typically need no 
sheath for carrying. Thus there is a need for a sharpening device 
which can be attached to a folding knife, but which is removable.  According to the present invention, a knife blade sharpening 
device is provided in the form of a removable appendage which is 
adapted to be secured to a knife and includes superabrasive 
material surface for sharpening. In further accord with the 
present invention, the knife blade sharpening device includes a 
plurality of superabrasive layers of varying abrasive texture. In 
still further accord with the present invention, the knife blade 
sharpening device includes a V-shaped appendage with two arms, each 
having an inside and an outside surface, and superabrasive layer 
secured to the inside surface of each arm. In still further accord 
with the present invention, the V-shaped appendage comprises a pair 
of tweezers of the general shape and size which are commonly fitted 
to pocket knives, said tweezers having been modified to also serve 
as a blade sharpener. In yet still further accord with the present 
invention, the superabrasive layer includes a diamond grit which is 
secured to the appendage. Another feature of the present invention is the ease and cost 
efficiency with which the invention can retrofit certain existing 
pocket knives. Swiss army folding type pocket knives commonly 
include a pair of tweezers as one of their detachable features. 
Such tweezers are suited to embody the V-shaped appendage of the 
present invention when a superabrasive layer is

<CLAIMS>
A knife blade sharpener, comprising 
   an elongated appendage adapted to be removably secured to a 

knife handle; and 
   a superabrasive layer disposed upon said removable appendage. 
The blade sharpener of claim 1 wherein said removable 
appendage comprises a V-shaped appendage having two arms, whereby 

superabrasive layer is disposed upon said arms. 
The blade sharpener of claim 1 wherein said removable 
appendage comprises a pair of tweezers having first and second 

opposed inside surfaces and first and second outside surfaces. 
The blade sharpener of claim 3 wherein said superabrasive 
layer is disposed upon said first inside surface of said tweezers. 
The blade sharpener of claim 3 wherein said superabrasive 
layer is disposed upon both said first inside surface and said 

second inside surface of said tweezers, thereby creating a first 
and a second inside sharpening surface. 
The blade sharpener of claim 5 wherein said first inside 
sharpening surface is of coarser abrasive texture than said second 

 
inside sharpening surface. 
The blade sharpener of claim 3 wherein said superabrasive 
layer is disposed upon said first outside surface. 
The blade sharpener of claim 3 wherein said superabrasive 
layer is disposed upon both said first outside surface and said 

second outside surface of said tweezers, thereby creating a first 
and a second outside sharpening surface. 
The blade sharpener of claim 8 wherein said first outside 
sharpening surface is of greater abrasive texture than said second 

outside sharpening surface. 
The blade sharpener of claim 1 wherein said abrasive layer 
includes a grit selected from the group consisting of diamond, 

silicon carbide, and aluminum oxide. 
The blade sharpener of claim 1 wherein said superabrasive 
layer is attached to said removable appendage by bonding means. 
The blade sharpener of claim 11 wherein said bonding means is 
electroplated metal. 
The blade sharpener of claim 1 wherein said superabrasive 
 

layer includes a free standing slab of diamond layer produced by 
chemical vapor deposition. 
A compact, lightweight, durable blade sharpener which can be 
secured to, and stored with, a folding blade pocket knife of the 

Swiss army type having a detachable tweezers feature and which fits 
removably into a rectangular box channel in the knife handle, 

comprising: 
   a pair of metal tweezers having two metal arms attached in 

cantilever fashion, each said arm having an inside surface; and 
   a diamond grit layer electroplated to said inside surfaces of 

said tweezer arms. 
A knife comprising a blade and a handle, the handle including 
an elongate channel and a sharpening tool removably secured in the 

channel, the sharpening tool comprising an elongated shaft on which 
is secured an abrasive layer. 
The knife according to claim 15 wherein the sharpening tool is 
a tweezers and the abrasive layer is secured to at least one 

surface of an arm of the tweezer. 
The knife according to claim 16 wherein the abrasive layer is 
a diamond grit layer electroplated to at least one inside surface 

of the tweezer.
