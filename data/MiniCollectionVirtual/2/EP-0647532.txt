<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus for forming image information corresponding to
its original image on recording sheets, for example
to an image forming apparatus for allowing copy fee or
printing fee at the store installing the apparatus
therein to be automatically calculated and displayed.Recently, the number of copy or printing shops for
serving copying or printing by using electrophotographic
copy machines or mimeographic printing machines has
increased among convenience stores and stationary stores.The image forming apparatus corresponding to these
purposes of the prior art are provided with a mechanical
key-counter for enabling the use of the apparatus by
inserting therein. Once copying or printing is
completed, the copy or print fee is calculated based on
the data of the number of printed sheets and the unit
price per sheet for the size of recording sheets.The fare adjustment may be easy when the printed
sheet size is limited to one or two. However, in the case
that a plurality of different sizes of recording sheets
has been used, the calculation of the printing charge may
be troublesome, and may result in the problem of
frequent calculation errors. PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, vol. 10, No. 358 (P-522) 2
December 1986 and JP-A-61156055, (MINOLTA CAMERA) is as
follows:PURPOSE: To form a copying machine provided with a copying
rate calculating function at the time of specific copying
requiring an additional rate by forming a control means for
calculating and displaying (unit price of each copying
paper size + unit price of additional rate) x (the number
of copied sheets) and a control means for calculating the
cumulative amount of the additional rates.CONSTITUTION: Copying paper is carried from a carrying
belt 22 to a fixing roller 24 through a guiding device 23,
a powdery image is fixed on the copying paper by the roller
24 and fixed paper is discharged by a discharge roller 25.
At that time, a paper discharge sensor 74 arranged close to
the discharge roller 25 detects whether the copying paper
is discharged or not. the copying machine 1 is provided
with the control means for calculating and displaying (unit
price of each copying paper size + unit price of additional
rate) X (the number of copied sheets) at the copying of a
specific original and the control means for calculating the
cumulative amount of the additional rates. Namely, a copy
allowing key sensor 75, a total counter 76 for displaying 
the total number of copied sheets and a sub-counter 77 for
displaying the

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus for forming image
information corresponding to an image of an original

document on recording sheets, comprising:

timer means (81) for sending timing data,
sheet size sensor means (48) for detecting the size
of said recording sheets (P),
counter means (52) for counting the number of the
recording sheets (P) on which the image information has

been recorded,
