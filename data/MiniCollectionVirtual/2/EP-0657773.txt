<ABSTRACT>
Construction:
 

   A color imaging material having a substrate 
and at least one photosensitive layer provided on the 

substrate, said photosensitive layer comprising, in 100 
parts by weight of a binder, 1 to 100 parts by weight 

of a fulgide compound having photochromic 
characteristics such that it has an absorption maximum 

in the region of 430 to 480 nm in color developed 
condition, 1 to 100 parts by weight of a fulgide 

compound having photochromic characteristics such that 
it has an-absorption maximum in the region of 500 to 

550 nm in color developed condition, and 1 to 100 parts 
by weight of a fulgide compound having photochromic 

characteristics such that it has an absorption maximum 
in the region of 600 to 650 rim in color developed 

condition. 
Technical Effect:
 

   A full color image can be obtained by 
a 
single
 time exposure. No other processing, such as 
development or fixation, is required. Multicolor 

images obtainable according to the invention have good 
dark-place storage stability and high image quality. 

The invention permits a wide range of binder selection. 
According to the invention, an image material capable 

of repetitive use is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to color image 
materials and, more particularly to a color imaging 
material capable of repetitive use. Hitherto, techniques for forming a color 
image on a substrate have been known including 
electrophotographic process, ink jet process, heat 
sensitive recording process, and transfer type heat 
sensitive recording process, which are already in 
practical application. However, these techniques have 
problems in operability, that is, complicated apparatus 
are required; operations for imaging process is 
conducted to each of colorants used; and operations for 
development and fixation are required. With these 
processes, therefore, it is impracticable to obtain 
images by simple and easy operation. It is also 
another problem that these processes can only produce 
permanent image and cannot provide color imaging 
material capable of repetitive use which is now largely 
demanded in the art of imaging. Attempts at providing a color imaging 
material capable of repetitive use which permits a 
color image to be formed in a simple and easy manner 
have been made by using photochromic compounds which 
will reversibly be developed and bleached through 
thermal or luminous energy. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 
S59-215382, for example, there is proposed a  
 
photochromic photosensitive material which contains at 
least two kinds of spiropyran having different 
absorption wavelengths in color developed condition. In this technique, however, since spiropyran 
is used as a photochromic compound, any resulting image 
has poor shelf stability, is of relatively lower 
resolution, and lacks color clearness. It is another 
problem that a desired color cannot be obtained unless 
the spiropyran is dispersed in a particular binder. 
This does not permit the spiropyran and a freely 
selected binder to be mixed, and makes it difficult to 
effect color adjustment. As a result, in order to 
provide a good color image, it is required to formulate 
each of the spiropyrans to each of different layers. 
Also, since single layer structure cannot be obtained, 
the manufacturing process for the image material is 
made complicated. Japanese Patent Kokoku Publication No. 
S53-23699, there is proposed a color image recording 
material formed in such a way that photochromic 
compositions having different visible light absorption 
spectra in colored condition are laid one over another 
in layer form or uniformly mixed together. However, in 
this case, spiropyrans are used as photochromic 
compounds
