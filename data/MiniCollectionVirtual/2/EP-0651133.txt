<ABSTRACT>
A diamond/cubic boron nitride coated low energy 
cutting insert (11) for an 

excavating tool. The insert includes a generally 
conical tip portion (12), an 

elongated intermediate portion (17), a shoulder (13) and 
a contact surface which attaches 

to a supporting surface (14A) of the tool body (10). 
The intermediate portion (17) of the insert 

includes a concave surface (17) portion and the 
coating is provided on the tip portion (12) 

and optionally on the intermediate portion (17) and the shoulder (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool for breaking or excavating of hard
material, such as asphalt, comprising a tool body and a cutting insert secured
thereto, for instance by brazing. The cutting insert is formed with a generally
conical tip portion and provided with a shoulder which in intended to rest
against a supporting surface on the tool body an insert having the features as set forth in the preamble portion of claim 1 is known for example through US patent No. 5,161,859.The purpose of the invention is to provide a wear-resistant tool of the
above type which requires a low cutting force at the same time as it is ensured
that the risk is low that the cutting insert will get loose even during working in
wear resistant material.The invention is described in detail in the following with reference to
the accompanying drawings, in which one embodiment is shown by way of
example. It is to be understood that this embodiment is only illustrative of the
invention and that various modifications thereof may be made within the scope
of the claims.The invention provides a wear resistant rotatable excavating tool having the features as set forth in the characterizing portion of claim 1. According to various features of the invention, the wear resistant coating
is of diamond and/or cubic boron nitride with or without one or more
intermediate non-diamond layers such as Ti, TiC or TiN. The concave surface
portion can have a constant radius of curvature. In addition, the distance (a)
from the abrupt transition between the tip portion and the intermediate portion
to the radially outermost portion of the rearwardly facing contact surface of the
shoulder can be larger than the distance (b) from the abrupt transition to the
axially forwardmost portion of the tip portion. The smallest diameter (d) of the
concave surface portion can be smaller than the distance (a+b) from the axially 
forwardmost portion of the tip portion to the radially outermost portion of the
rearwardly facing contact surface of the shoulder.FIG. 1 shows a side view, partly in section, of a prior art tool for
breaking hard material;FIG. 2 shows a side view, partly in section, of another prior art tool;FIG. 3 shows one embodiment of a tool according to the invention; andFIG. 4 shows on an enlarged scale the cutting insert in the tool shown in
FIG. 3.Corresponding details in the various figures have been given the same
reference numeral.Tools of the type in question are usually mounted rotatably in a tool
holder, which in turn is attached to an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rotatable excavating tool for breaking hard material, comprising:

an elongated tool body (10) having an end with a diameter and a supporting
surface (14);
a cutting insert (11) of hard metal having a tip portion (12), an elongated
intermediate portion (17) and a shoulder (13), the tip portion being generally conical in shape, the

shoulder having a diameter substantially larger than the maximum diameter of the tip
portion, the intermediate portion being integral with and extending between the tip portion

and the shoulder so as to define an abrupt transition from the tip portion, the intermediate
portion having a maximum diameter which is substantially less than the diameter of the

tool body end, the intermediate portion including a concave surface portion (17') extending
radially outwardly between the tip portion and the shoulder, the shoulder being integrally

joined to the concave surface portion, and the cutting insert having a rearwardly facing
contact surface (20) attached to the supporting surface of the tool body, characterized by
a wear resistant coating (60) of material harder than the cutting insert, the
coating being on at least an exposed working surface of the tip portion (12), the coating (60)

comprising at least one layer of diamond and/or cubic boron nitride with one or more
non-diamond intermediate layers between the cutting insert and the layer of diamond

and/or cubic boron nitride.
A tool according to claim 1, wherein the coating (60) comprises a single layer
of diamond.
A tool according to claim 1, wherein the concave surface portion (17') has a
constant radius of curvature.
A tool according to claim 1, wherein a distance (a) from the abrupt
transition between the tip portion (12) and the intermediate portion (17) to the radially outermost

portion (19) of the rearwardly facing contact surface (20) of the shoulder (13) is larger than a distance
(b) from the abrupt transition to the axially forwardmost portion of the tip portion (12).
A tool according to claim 4, wherein a smallest diameter (d) of the concave
surface portion (17') is smaller than the distance (a+b) from the axially forwardmost portion of

the tip portion (12) to the radially outermost portion (19) of the rearwardly facing contact surface (20)
of the shoulder (13).
A tool according to claim 1, wherein the coating (60) only covers the tip
portion (12).
A tool according to claim 1, wherein the coating (60) completely covers the tip
portion (12) and the intermediate portion (17). 
A tool according to claim wherein the coating (60) completely covers the tip
portion (12), the intermediate portion (17) and the shoulder (13).
