A method of manufacturing an oxide superconductor, comprising 
the steps of alternately laminating layers of an oxide 

superconductor (2) or a precursor thereof and a metal material 
layer (1) by a desired number of times, forming an outermost 

layer of a metal material on a laminated body, and performing 

predetermined heating and cooling operations of the laminated 
body as it is or after the laminated body is elongated into a 

desired shape, characterized in that the step of performing the 
heating and cooling operations comprises the step of heating 

the laminated body at a temperature to partially melt the oxide 
superconductor or the precursor thereof or more, and cooling to 

recrystallize the molten oxide superconductor or precursor 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide 
superconductor used in a transmission and distribution 
wire, a power cable, an equipment lead wire, a magnet 
wire, and a magnetic shield and a method of manufacturing 
the same and, more particularly, to an oxide 
superconductor capable of supplying a large current 
with zero resistance or small alternating-current 
loss. An intermetallic compound such as NbTi, Nb₃Sn, 
Nb₃Aℓ, or V₃Ga and a metal such as Nb or Pb are used 
as superconductive magnets, magnetic shields, 
coaxial cables, and cavities by utilizing an ultra 
low-temperature refrigerant such as liquid helium. 
These metallic materials, however, are limited as 
resources. In addition, helium is used to increase 
cost, which limits the range of practical applications. To the contrary, some substances which can be 
rendered superconductive at low critical temperatures 
(Tc) by inexpensive refrigerants have been found, and 
extensive studies on practical use of such substances 
in a variety of applications have been actively made. As the high Tc materials described above, 
La2-xBaxCu0₄ and La2-xSrxCuO₄ oxide superconductors 
have critical temperatures of 30 to 45K; a 
Y(Dy,Er,Ho)Ba₂Cu3O₇₋δ oxide superconductor has  
 
a critical temperature of up to 95K; Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O based 
oxide superconductors such as Bi₂Sr₂CaCu₂O₈ and 
Bi₂Sr₂Ca₂Cu₃O₁₀ oxide superconductors have critical 
temperatures of 80 to 110K; and Tℓ-Ba-Ca-Cu-O based 
oxide superconductors such as Tl₂Ba₂CaCu₂O₈, 
Tℓ₂Ba₂Ca₂Cu₃O₁₀ and TℓBa₂Ca₂Cu₇O8.5 oxide superconductors 
have critical temperatures of 90 to 125K. These 
oxide superconductors are manufactured as follows. A 
powder of each superconductor is kneaded with an organic 
binder to obtain a paste, and the paste is directly 
extrusion molded or screen-printed. Alternatively, the 
powder of each superconductor is filled in an Ag pipe or 
the like, and the pipe is elongated to obtain a conductor 
having a desired shape. In a superconductor, a metal stabilizing material 
is combined with a superconductor molded body to cope 
with a so-called quench phenomenon in which a superconductive 
state is lost. For the same purpose as in the 
oxide superconductor, it is proposed to combine a metal 
stabilizing material with an oxide superconductor. When 
the superconductive state is lost, the oxide superconductor 
becomes an insulator, and it is difficult to 
conduct heat or electric power to the metal stabilizing 
material. For this reason, a quench phenomenon more 
easily occurs. In particular, in
