<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a backwash filter (10) which can be backwashed with the liquid to be filtered. The filter according to the invention has a plurality of filter elements (25) arranged in the filter housing (11) and through which flow passes, the arrangement being such that in the filtration operation dirty liquid flows equally through the two ends (26, 27) of the filter elements and in the backwash operation the filter elements are joined at one end to a wash element (33) and are connected at their other end (26), preferably with intermediate connection of a throttle element (45 and 46), to the dirty liquid feed (14). By this means, in addition to high filtration efficiency with low pressure drops, particularly effective backwashing of the individual filter elements is achieved and their blockage is reliably avoided.

<CLAIMS>
Back-purge filter, comprising filter elements, which are arranged
circularly relative to each other in the filter housing and flowed

through in the longitudinal direction and during filtering operations
connected or connectable with both its ends (26, 27) to the filter

inlet and for back-purging connected individually or in groups to
a rinsing element which is connected to a sludge discharge and

driven by a rotary drive, 
characterised in that
 the filter elements
(25) are back-purgable with the soiled liquid which is to be filtered

and covered or coverable with one or more throttle elements
(45, 46) at the input end (26) opposite the rinsing element (33).
Back-purge filter according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
throttle element (45 or 46) is a throttle plate which is positioned at

a distance (
a
) from the input end (26), forming with the latter an
annular gap (66).
Back-purge filter according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the throttle plate (45 or 46) is adjustable relative to its
distance (
a
) to the input end (20).
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the throttle element(s) (45, 46) and the
rinsing element (33) are mounted on a common rotary shaft (32,

40) arranged inside the filter housing.
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the filter elements (25) are arranged on at
least two hole circles (23, 24) which are concentric relative to

each other.
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the filter housing (11) comprises a first
input chamber (15) and a second input chamber (19) which is

linked to the latter via a connecting pipe (21).
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the connecting pipe (21) is positioned in 
the centre of the filter elements (25) which are arranged in

circular rings (23, 24).
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the filter elements (25) are filter candles,
which extend in a straight line, are open on both sides and

arranged between a first perforated plate (18) and a second
perforated plate (20) having for each filter candle (25) a hole (22)

to offer a passage to the soiled liquid.
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 one of the perforated plates (18) forms a
control mirror surface (38) for the rinsing element (33) which is

provided with at least one connecting piece (36) which glides on
the control mirror surface (38) and connects the holes (22) during

a rotary movement in alternating sequence to the sludge
discharge (32).
Back-purge filter according to one of Claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the rinsing element (33) comprises at least
two radial rinsing arms (34, 35), and the one rinsing arm (34)

controls the filter elements (25) at the outer circle (23) and the
other rinsing arm (35) controls the filter elements (25) at the inner
