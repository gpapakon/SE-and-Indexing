<ABSTRACT>
A passively-multiplexed resistor array has rows and columns of 
conductors. Resistors span the intersections of the conductors, 

and one or more selected resistors may be energized by energizing 
the corresponding row(s) and column(s). However, other, 

unselected, resistors may also be partially energized. By adding 
additional rows or columns of "minimizer" resistors, the maximum 

power in unselected resistors may be reduced. The minimizer 
resistors are electrically connected in the passively-multiplexed 

resistor array but do not perform the function of the other 
resistors in the array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of passively-multiplexed
resistor arrays. More specifically, the present invention pertains
to decreasing the peak power dissipated by unselected resistors in
a passively-multiplexed resistor array.Large resistors arrays are used in many applications. Two examples
are thermal printheads used to print on thermal paper or used in
thermal transfer printing and thermal ink-jet printheads. In these
applications, electric currents are driven through selected
resistors in the resistor array to "mark" the print medium at a
specific location.Because these resistor arrays can comprise large numbers of
resistors, directly driving each resistor is typically impractical.
Thus, some form of multiplexing may be used, thereby decreasing the
number of leads required to control the resistors.One type of multiplexing is known as "passive multiplexing," and is
shown in FIG. 1. In the exemplary passively-multiplexed resistor
array shown, a plurality of resistors R11-R64 are connected in an
array having six rows 12a-12f and four columns 10a-10d.The columns 10a-10d may be selectively connected to a voltage
source 16 via column switches 18a-18d. Each column 10a-10d can be
"activated" in turn by closing its respective column switch. In
passive multiplexing, only one column switch may be closed at one
time; the other column switches must be open. The rows 12a-12f may
be selectively connected to ground via switches 20a-20f. Each row
12a-12f can be selected by closing its respective switch. Multiple
rows may be selected simultaneously. Each resistor R11-R64 bridges a respective intersection of the rows
12a-12f and columns 10a-10d. By activating a column and selecting
a row, the resistor which bridges the activated column and selected
row thereby has a voltage imposed across it and is thus directly
driven. In FIG. 1, the first column 10a is shown activated and the
first and third rows 12a and 12c are shown selected. Thus,
resistors R11 and R31 are shown directly driven.In the schematic diagram of FIG. 1, the resistors R11-R64 are shown
in a rectangular arrangement. This graphical arrangement is
selected only for the convenience of this description. The
resistors may be physically arrayed in any arbitrary arrangement
provided that the electrical connections remain as shown. For
example, the resistors could be arranged in a line for a thermal
printhead or a pair of lines for a thermal ink-jet printhead.In a passively-multiplexed resistor array, current can flow through
every resistor R11-R64
