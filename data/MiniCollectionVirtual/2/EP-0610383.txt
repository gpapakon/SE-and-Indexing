<ABSTRACT>
A new and improved unshielded horizontal magnetoresistive head (100) is disclosed which utilizes multiple pairs of magnetoresistive elements (1, 2, 3, 4). The present invention provides a device which is characterized by reduced output signal undershoot amplitudes, and an increased central peak pulse amplitude, while not significantly affecting the resolution of the device. The device is also characterized by increased signal to noise and signal to interference ratios. Magnetoresistive elements (1, 2, 3, 4) utilized in the device may be fabricated and/or manufactured by simplified processes, resulting in fabrication, manufacturing and cost benefits for the magnetoresistive head. Any number of additional magnetoresistive head. Any number of additional magnetoresistive element pairs may be utilized dependent on the accuracy and resolution required by the specific application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to an improved
horizontal magnetoresistive head which is unshielded and
which may be utilized for magnetic sensing and reading. In
particular, the present invention relates to an improvement
over the invention described in U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 07/605,513 which is assigned to the assignee of
the present invention. The improvement relates to the
utilization of multiple pairs of magnetoresistive sensing
elements. All of the fabrication and manufacturing
techniques and advantages, as well as the cost advantages,
of the magnetoresistive head described in U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 07/605,513 are equally applicable to
the improved device described herein.The improved magnetoresistive head of the present
invention may be utilized in a bill validator to sense the
magnetic properties inherent in paper currency, such as U.S.
currency, and in many other applications involving magnetic
sensing or reading which will be readily apparent to those
skilled in the pertinent art in view of the following
disclosure.A magnetoresistive head is a sensing or reading head
which utilizes magnetoresistive elements to sense or read
magnetic information inherent in a magnetic medium. A
magnetoresistive element is one whose electrical resistance
varies with varying incident magnetic fields. Many prior art magnetic heads, for a great many
applications including coin sensing, determining the
contents of a coin tube, currency and bill validation, and
determination of the denomination of paper currency or other
forms of scrip, are of the inductive type which require a
rapidly changing magnetic field in order for magnetic
information to be detected and recorded. Magnetoresistive
heads, on the other hand, are capable of detecting and
reading information inherent in a slowly moving or
stationary magnetic field. Prior art magnetoresistive heads
are typically difficult to fabricate and consequently,
relatively expensive.The present invention describes a new and improved
magnetoresistive head in which multiple pairs of
magnetoresistive sensing elements are situated either in
contact with, or adjacent to, the magnetic medium to be read
in an unshielded horizontal configuration.The unshielded horizontal magnetoresistive head
disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/605,513
provided for many fabrication and manufacturing advantages
as well as their associated cost benefits. The present
invention provides for a device having all of the
fabrication, manufacturing, and associated cost
