<ABSTRACT>
A pad for use in a magnetic tape cassette, which 
includes a base material (2), a large number of fluorocarbon 

fibers (1) filled on the base material, and a metallic plate 
spring (4) on which the base material is fixed at its side not 

filled with the fluorocarbon fibers (1). The fluorocarbon 
fibers are improved in the fiber falling off suppressing 

effect when they are subjected to easy adhering treatment such 
as plasma discharge treatment or corona discharge treatment. 

The base material (2) should preferably be of a double layer 
structure of a film-like sheet and an elastic member, and most 

preferably, should have a polyester group film as the film-like 
sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
magnetic tape cassette, and more particularly, to a pad 
employed in a magnetic tape cassette to be used, for example, 
for audio appliances. Conventionally, the pad used for an audio magnetic 
tape cassette has been prepared by forming animal fibers, for 
example, of a rabbit, sheep or the like into a felt material, 
which is mounted on a metallic plate spring. Meanwhile, there 
has also been conventionally proposed, for example, in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Tokkaisho No. 64-57469 
(i.e., Tokkaihei No. 01-57469), a pad formed by filling or 
setting synthetic fibers on a supporting layer which is then 
mounted on a metallic plate spring. In an embodiment of the 
above prior art, polyamide, and synthetic fibers of acrylic 
or polyester and cellulose group are described as materials 
therefor. Recently, some magnetic tapes used as a digital 
audio cassette (referred to as DCC hereinafter) or the like, 
are provided with a back coat layer mainly composed of carbon, 
etc. at the side opposite to the magnetic face of the magnetic 
tape in order to reduce adhesion of foreign matters to the  
 
magnetic tape by lowering electrical resistance thereof for 
decreasing writing or reading errors of digital signals. However, when a coefficient of dynamic friction 
against the back coat layer in the above magnetic tape was 
measured with respect to the pad prepared by the felt material 
of the animal fibers of a rabbit, sheep or the like mounted 
on the metallic plate spring as described above, it was found 
high at 0.35. In the case where the above pad was attached 
to a tape cassette, which was then loaded on a tape cassette 
recorder for recording and reproducing, the magnetic tape 
caused a "stick slip" with respect to the pad to produce an 
abnormal noise so-called "tape squeaking", thus giving rise 
to a serious problem on the characteristics of the product. On the other hand, in the pad as disclosed in 
Tokkaisho No. 64-57469 referred to above, since the synthetic 
fibers superior in slidability such as nylon, etc. are 
employed as compared with the animal fibers used in the known 
pad, although the dynamic frictional coefficient with respect 
to the back coat layer of the magnetic tape is comparatively 
low at 0.29, the serious problem of "tape squeaking" still 
occurred when the pad was mounted on a tape cassette and then, 
the tape cassette was loaded in the tape cassette recorder for 
recording and reproducing. Such problem related to "tape
