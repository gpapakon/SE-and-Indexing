<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a camera 
having a red-eye reducing function to prevent 

occurrence of the so-called red-eye phenomenon by 
preliminarily projecting light to a subject in photo-taking 

with flash light (25). The camera of the above type 
is so arranged that when the photo-taking mode is set 

to a mode requiring quick photo-taking response 
suitable for photo-taking of a moving object, for 

example to the servo AF mode, the light projection for 
preventing the red eye phenomenon is preliminarily 

inhibited even in the flash light (25) photo-taking to 
maintain the quick photo-taking response.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement
in an automatic focusing camera provided with a red-eye
reducing function in shooting with flash light, having
a photo-taking mode suitable for photo-taking of still
bodies, such as the one-shot AF (autofocus) mode for
inhibiting the operation of a focusing unit once the
in-focus state is achieved, and a photo-taking mode
suitable for photo-taking of moving bodies, such as the
servo AF mode for repeating detection of the focus
state after the in-focus state is achieved and
permitting the operation of the focusing unit depending
upon the focus state or the moving-body anticipation
(or predictive) AF mode for performing focusing in
accordance with focus detection results and
anticipation (or prediction) of movement of a subject.There are commonly known cameras having the
automatic focusing (AF) function to detect the focus
condition to automatically adjust the position of the
focal point. The cameras of this type are provided
with the one-shot AF mode for stopping the AF function
(or inhibiting the focusing operation) once focused,
and the servo AF mode for repeating the detection of 
the focal point after focused and effecting the AF
function depending upon the focus condition (or
performing the focusing operation).The former, the one-shot AF mode, is effective
to take photographs of still subjects, for example,
scenic photographs or commemorative photographs,
because re-framing after focused can be simply made in
the state of inhibiting the focusing operation after
focused. The latter, the servo AF mode, is effective
to take photographs of moving subjects, for example,
sports photographs or race photographs, because the in-focus
state is always maintained even with variations
of the focus position in the state of continuing the
focusing operation after focused.Now the processing capacity of micon is so
improved, the moving-body anticipation AF is also
devised to anticipate a motion of a subject and adjust
the focus so as to make the lens system in focus upon
shutter drive.Most of recent AF cameras are normally provided
with a variety of AF modes as described above and a
built-in flash device. Another device is the method
for reducing the red-eye phenomenon by applying light
to a man (subject) immediately before exposure in
shooting with flash light. The red-eye phenomenon is a
phenomenon that when the flash light is used to take a
photograph of a man under the low luminance condition, 
with the pupils of the eyeballs open, the red light is
reflected on the

<CLAIMS>
A camera comprising:

autofocusing means (10, 14-19);
control means (19) operable in a first mode suitable
for photographing a moving subject, in which autofocusing may be repeated after obtaining an in-focus state with respect to the subject by using said autofocusing means (10, 14-19),

and operable in a
second mode suitable for photographing a still subject,

in which autofocusing is inhibited as a result of obtaining an in-focus state
with respect to the subject by using said autofocusing means (10, 14-19);
means (29) for performing light projection toward the
subject before the start of photographing in flash light

photography, said light projection being suitable for
reducing the red-eye phenomenon,
characterized by:

   means (19) arranged to inhibit said light projection
when said control means (19) is set to operate in said

first mode. 
A camera according to Claim 1, wherein said
first photo-taking mode is an anticipation autofocus

mode.
A camera according to Claim 2, wherein said
anticipation autofocus mode is a mode for obtaining a

lens drive amount, based on a previously detected focus
state and a currently detected focus state.
