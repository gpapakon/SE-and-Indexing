<ABSTRACT>
Method of and apparatus for forming stacks of 
articles each comprising a first article stack on top of a 

second article and feeding the stacks forward wherein 
articles to be stacked are fed forward generally 

continuously one after another in series in a generally 
horizontal path at a predetermined level with the articles 

at spaced apart intervals along said path, the first of 
two successive articles in the series is picked up in 

synchronous relationship with the articles being fed 
forward and transported to a position above said level for 

placement of the first article on top of the second of the 
two successive articles as the second article continues to 

move forward at said level, and the first article is 
placed on top of the second as the second continues to 

move forward at said level for accumulation of the two 
articles in a stack comprising the first article on top of 

the second article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of 
and apparatus for stacking articles, and more 
particularly to a method of and apparatus for forming 
stacks of articles, such as rolls of paper, and 
especially rolls of toilet tissue or paper toweling, for 
ensuing wrapping of the stacks. The invention has been developed especially for 
the accumulation of stacks of rolls of paper such as 
toilet tissue and paper toweling into stacks, and 
ultimate delivery of stacks to wrapping apparatus of the 
type as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,430,844 of Robert 
C. James, issued February 14, 1984 to Hayssen 
Manufacturing Company of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, entitled 
Method of and Apparatus for Wrapping Articles. Wrapping 
apparatus of this type has been used for some years for 
wrapping rolls of paper (toilet tissue and household 
toweling) in both single roll and multiple roll 
configurations, generally in what is referred to as a 
"cores down" single level configuration. A "cores down" 
configuration is the configuration resulting from passage 
of the rolls through the wrapping machine as illustrated 
in said James U. S. patent with the cores of the rolls 
(the axes of the rolls) horizontal (as opposed to passing 
through the apparatus with the cores vertical, i.e. 
"cores up"). Rolls wrapped in this manner are currently 
widely sold in one roll, two roll, three roll, four roll, 
six roll, nine roll, twelve roll and sixteen roll 
packages. Market demand, particularly in Europe, has 
caused the package configuration to go from "cores down"  
 
to "cores up", and there is also a trend to go to more 
rolls in a single package to form what are referred to as 
"family packs". Packages with more rolls in a single level 
"cores down" configuration have been marketed, but 
present a problem in that the packages being of increased 
length and width are somewhat unstable. Also, they are 
difficult to stack on store shelves and difficult for the 
customer to handle and store in the home. The problems 
arising from packaging more rolls in a single level 
"cores down" configuration may be avoided by packaging 
stacks of rolls, e.g. by adding a second layer of rolls 
for double the number of rolls, without substantially 
changing the dimensional stability of the package, the 
package also being capable of being stored in less space 
and in a more convenient manner and using less packaging 
material than packages of similar numbers of rolls in the 
single level format. Reference may be made to U.S. Patent No.
