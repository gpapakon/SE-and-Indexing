<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims to provide a connector in which 
a stationary connector housing is provided on its flange 

with a cushion member to be closely attached to a panel 
to give a stable seal function regardless of a change of 

thickness of the panel. A male connector housing 13 of 
the connector is provided on an upper periphery on a hood 

13b with a flange 13d. The male connector housing 13 is 
provided with securing fixtures 19 made of a leaf spring 

material. The housing 13 is secured to a periphery around 
an opening 12a in a panel 12 by clamping it between an 

upper elastic piece 19a and a flange 13d. The flange 13d 
is provided on its upper face with a cushion member 20 which 

is softer than a seal member 16 of a waterproofing cover 17. 
When a female connector housing 14 is fitted to the male 

connector housing 13, the seal member 16 closely contacts 
with a surface of the panel. A compressive deformation of 

the cushion member 20 makes a distance between the upper 
face of the flange 13d and a lower end of the seal member 

16 a given value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector including a stationary
connector housing to be attached to an opening in a panel and a detachable
connector housing which is provided with a waterproofing seal member
and is adapted to be fitted to the stationary connector housing.DE-A-36 03 158 shows the features of the pre-characterising
portion of claim 1.For convenience of explanation, a conventional connector provided
with a waterproofing construction will be described below by referring to
FIGS. 4 and 5.FIG. 4 is a longitudinal sectional view of a conventional connector,
illustrating a state of the connector attached to a panel having a relatively
small thickness. FIG. 5 is a longitudinal sectional view of a conventional
connector, illustrating a state of the connector attached to a panel having a
relatively large thickness.In the conventional connector shown in FIG. 4, the male connector
housing 1 has a flange 1a on an upper end periphery of a hood 1b which
is opened at an upper face. The flange 1a is attached to the rear periphery
around an opening 2a in a panel 2 to secure the housing 1 to the panel 2.
On the other hand, a female connector housing 3 is covered with a
waterproofing cover 4 at its upper face and is provided around an upper
periphery with a waterproofing rubber seal member 5.In this case, the female connector housing 3 is coupled to the male
connector housing 1 through the panel 2 by fastening a bolt on a center 
front side of the panel 2 into a nut 7 on a center rear side of the panel 2.
At this time, terminals (not shown) in both the connector housings 1 and 3
are interconnected and the seal member 5 closely contacts with a front
periphery around the opening 2a in the panel 2 with the member 5 being
compressed by a given amount, thereby preventing water on the outside
from entering the housings. However, the panel 2 on which the connector is
mounted has various thicknesses. For example, there are
not only a panel 2 shown in FIG. 4 which is relatively thin
but also a panel 2 shown in FIG. 5 which is relatively
thick. However, if the thickness of the panel 2 is changed,
a distance between the flange 1a of the male connector
housing 1 and the surface of the panel 2, that is, a lower
end of the seal member 5 is changed in accordance with the
thickness in the above conventional construction.If a connector in which a dimension and a shape of
the seal member 5 are set to be suitable for, e.g. a thin
panel 2 shown in FIG. 4 is attached to a thick panel 2
shown in FIG. 5, a compression amount of the

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising:

a stationary connector housing (13) adapted to be secured to a rear
side of a panel (12) having an opening (12a) so that a connecting end

portion (13) of said housing is opposed to said opening (12a);
a detachable connector housing (14) adapted to be removably
attached to a front side of said panel (12) and fitted through said opening

(12a) in said panel (12) to said stationary connector housing (13);
a waterproofing seal member (16) provided on said detachable
connector housing (14) for closely contacting with a front side periphery

around said opening (12a) in said panel (12) upon fitting of said connector
housings (13, 14);
a flange (13d) provided on said stationary connector housing (13)
and adapted to be opposed to a rear side periphery around said opening

(12a) in said panel (12); and
a cushion member (20) disposed between said flange (13d) and said
rear side periphery around said opening (12a) in said panel (12),

characterised in that

said stationary connector housing (13) and said detachable connector
housing (14) are completely interconnected and said cushion member (20)

is made of a material which is softer than said seal member (16).
A connector according to Claim 1, wherein said stationary
connector housing (13) has securing fixtures (19) made of a leaf spring 

material, and wherein said panel (12) is clamped between said securing
fixtures (19) and said flange (13d) to secure said stationary connector

housing (13) to said panel (12).
