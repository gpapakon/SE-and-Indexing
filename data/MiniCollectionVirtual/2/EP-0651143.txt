<ABSTRACT>
An automatic transmission flusher and refill 
system includes a storage tank (33) for waste transmission 

fluid and a storage tank (35) for unused or replacement 
transmission fluid. A fluid-conducting hose (13) leading 

from the automatic transmission is connected to a fluid 
flow path leading to the waste fluid storage tank (33) and 

which includes an electric valve (27) and flow rate 
monitoring gauge (29). A second fluid-conducting hose (15) is 

connected to a pump (37) for pumping fluid from the unused 
fluid storage tank (35) into the transmission. The rate at 

which fluid is pumped out is monitored and a flow 
control valve (39) in the new fluid flow path is adjusted so 

that replacement fluid is pumped into the transmission 
at the same flow rate as used fluid is being pumped out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to vehicle maintenance and, more particularly, to
an apparatus for flushing and filling automatic transmissions with transmission fluid.
Flushing and filling automatic transmissions with fluid or oil according to
prior art methods is a relatively time-consuming and cumbersome process. The
conventional method is to change the fluid in the pan of the tranmission. The pan
typically holds from 1 to 5 litres (1-5 quarts) of the 7 to 15 litres (7-15 quarts) of oil which are
in the transmission. Hence, this conventional service is ineffective, since it mixes new
fluid with a large quantity of used fluid. More recently there have been efforts to
change all the fluid by disconnecting the fluid hose and draining the fluid into a waste
oil sump while manually pouring new fluid into the transmission dipstick hole. This
procedure has proved inadequate and unsafe, and has resulted in damage to
transmissions on which it has been used.A device for automating the exchange of fluid in an automatic transmission is
disclosed in Japanese patent specification number JP/A/2072299. In use the device is
connected in line between upstream and downstream portions of a conduit which
circulates fluid from the transmission to an oil cooler. The device comprises a tank
for receiving used fluid from a drain line connected to an upstream part of the conduit
and also a tank of new fluid which is connected to a downstream portion of the
conduit by a feed line. The device includes a pump for pumping new fluid to the
transmission and solenoid controlled valves for opening and closing the drain and feed
lines. In operation, a volume of fluid is first drained from the transmission conduit
and measured in a volume meter. The drain line valve is then closed and the feed line
valve is opened. The pump is then activated to pump a metered volume of fluid
(corresponding to the volume drained) to the transmission. As with the method
described above, there is a danger of damaging the transmission if the fluid level in
the transmission drops too far before the replacement fluid is supplied to the
transmission. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an apparatus which
simplifies and reduces the time involved in flushing and refilling an automatic
transmission.It is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus which
automatically flushes used transmission fluid and refills the transmission with new
fluid with minimal operator intervention.According to the present invention there is provided an

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for replacing fluid in an automatic transmission wherein said fluid
is circulated through a remote cooler (16) via conduits, comprising:


a receptacle (33) for used fluid;
a source (35) of fresh fluid;
a drain line (13) for conducting used fluid issuing from the upstream side of
one of the conduits (21) to said receptacle (33);
a feed line (15) for conducting fresh fluid from said source (35) to the
downstream side (19) of said conduit (21);
a pump (37) disposed between said source (35) and the downstream side of
said conduit (21) for forcing fresh fluid through said feed line (15) into the

transmission;

   characterised in that at least one of said drain and feed lines (13;15) is
provided with a flow control valve (29, 39) for regulating the flow rate of fluid

through the respective line so as to match the flow rate of used fluid issuing from the
transmission and the flow rate of fresh fluid into the transmission. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said at least one flow control valve
(39) is in said feed line (15) for regulating the flow of fresh fluid through said feed

line (15) into the transmission.
Apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising a flow control valve (29)
in said drain line (13) for regulating the flow rate of used fluid from the transmission

through the drain line (13).
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, further comprising a flow meter
(31) for measuring the flow rate of the used fluid from the upstream side of said

conduit (21), and a flow meter (41) for measuring the flow rate of the fresh fluid being
forced into the downstream side of said conduit (21). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said pump (37) is
electrically powered.
Apparatus according to claim 5, further comprising an electric cut-off valve
(27) for controlling the flow of used fluid through the drain line (13) wherein the flow

path is opened upon activation.
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said pump (37) and valve (27) are
powered by a 12V power source.
Apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7, further comprising a pressure
switch (23) for simultaneously activating the electric pump (37) and electric valve

(27) upon sensing a predetermined pressure in the drain line (15).
Method for replacing fluid in an automatic transmission wherein said fluid is
circulated through a remote cooler (16) via conduits (21, 22), comprising the steps of:


intercepting one of said conduits (21) to interconnect the upstream side with a
used fluid receptacle (33), and the downstream side with a source of fresh fluid (35);
causing the transmission pump to expel fluid into said receptacle (33) at a
controlled flow rate; and
causing an external pump (37) to force fresh fluid from said source (35) into
said transmission via the downstream side of the intercepted conduit (21),

characterised in that fresh fluid is supplied to said transmission at a flow rate matched
to the rate at which fluid is being expelled into said receptacle (33).
The method of claim 9, wherein the flow rate of fresh fluid being pumped into
said transmission is matched to the flow rate of used fluid being expelled from the

transmission by monitoring gauges (31, 41) measuring the respective flow rates and 
adjusting a flow control valve (39) disposed between the source (35) of fresh fluid and

the downstream side of the intercepted conduit (21) so as to effect a matched reading.
The method of claim 9 or claim 10, further comprising the step of adjusting a
flow control valve (29) disposed between the upstream side of the intercepted conduit

(21), and the used fluid receptacle (33) to limit the flow rate of used fluid being
expelled therefrom to a rate at which fresh fluid can be pumped into said transmission.
