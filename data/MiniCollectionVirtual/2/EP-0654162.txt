<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and a device for detecting
fouling of an axial compressor, said compressor comprising a rotor and a
housing, said rotor being rotatably mounted within said housing for rotation
about a rotational axis with variable or constant rotational speed, said
compressor further comprising at least one compressor stage, each of said at
least one stages comprising a row of rotor blades mounted on said rotor and
being arranged one following the other in a circumferential direction with
respect to said rotational axis and of a row of stator blades mounted on said
housing and being arranged one following the other in a circumferential
direction with respect to said rotational axis.The invention provides for a detection of fouling of either multi- or single
stage compressors. The compressor may be operated as an isolated unit or in
conjunction with a power turbine engine, as would be the case in a power plant
operation. The compressor may further be part of a gas turbine used for driving
aeroplanes, ships or large vehicles.Compressors exist of a series of rotating or stationary blade rows in
which the combination of a rotor (circular rotating blade row) and a stator
(circular stationary blade row) forms one stage. Inside the rotor, kinetic energy
is transferred to the gas flow (usually air) by the individual airfoil blades. In
the following stator, this energy is manifested as a pressure rise in the gaseous
air as a consequence of deceleration of the gaseous air flow. This deceleration of
the gaseous air flow is induced as a result of the design of the stator section.
The pressure ratio (exit pressure/ inlet pressure) of a single stage is limited
because of intrinsic aerodynamic factors, so several stages are connected
together in many turbo compressors to achieve higher pressure ratios than
could be achieved by a single stage.When operating an axial compressor, the problem of "fouling" arises,
namely the continuous contamination of the surfaces of the rotor and stator
blades with oil and dust,particularly of the first compressor stages at the inlet
of the compressor. In an initial phase of the fouling problem, an increased surface
roughness of the blades may be observed, influencing the behavior of the
boundary layer air associated with the blades. The air fluid flow around each
blade has an associated flow boundary layer which covers each blade and
coheres to the blade. The flow boundary layer associated with a rotor blade will
rotate as an associated entity of the blade as
