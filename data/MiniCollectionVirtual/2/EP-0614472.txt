<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation curable
poly(α-olefin) pressure-sensitive adhesive
compositions. The invention relates particularly to
radiation curable poly(α-olefin) pressure-sensitive
adhesive compositions having improved resistance to
oxidative degradation and superior cohesive strength
particularly at elevated temperatures, without use of
tackifiers, and to laminated structures made therefrom.A continuing need in the pressure-sensitive
adhesive (PSA) art is achievement of better control
over various mechanical and process properties so that
adhesives can be "tailor-made" for specific, highly
demanding end-use applications such as packaging,
medical, and masking tapes. These applications require
a proper balance of properties, and this balance
changes with the particular end-use.Among the earliest polymers to provide a
reasonable balance of the properties required for
satisfactory PSA performance were the natural and
synthetic rubbers. However, these PSAs had poor aging
properties, and the art quickly recognized the need to
eliminate ethylenically-unsaturated groups from the
polymer backbone of rubber adhesives in order to
improve their oxidative stability.With the discovery of ZN catalysts, it became
possible to polymerize α-olefin monomers to high
molecular weight. The homopolymers of the C6-C10 α-olefins
were naturally tacky and therefore good
candidates for PSAs since they also had low toxicity,
good aging and favorable environmental stability (i.e.,
low oxidation). These homopolymers were chemically 
inert, resistant to plasticizer migration, and
relatively inexpensive. However, they had poor
cohesive strength and therefore lacked characteristics
necessary for use at elevated temperatures.Radiation curing has been frequently used to
chemically crosslink the polymeric component of
adhesives in attempts to increase the cohesive strength
of coated adhesive films. The results have been
unsatisfactory because competing crosslinking and
degradation (chain scission) reactions occur
simultaneously. Therefore, in some PSA systems,
especially those formulated from polymers containing
propylene, radiation curing leads to a loss of cohesive
strength and shear adhesion.Adhesives derived primarily from C6 or larger α-olefins
are well known in the art. U.S. Patent No.

compositions comprising mixtures of polyolefin
copolymers derived from olefin monomers with different
