<ABSTRACT>
The present invention continuously monitors the amount of 
curing radiation available for curing coating material on a moving 

optical 
fiber (21) and includes a curing system having a radiation source (66) 

capable of 
providing radiation energy for curing coating material on an optical 

fiber (21) 
and a reflector system (60,62,64) which redirects non-direct radiation 

back toward the 
article. An optical fiber (21) which has been provided with a curable 

coating 
material is moved along a path of travel a curing area. The coating 

material 
is cured by causing the radiation source (66) to emit energy suitable for 

curing 
the curable coating material. The predictable average amount of light 

energy properly redirected by the reflector system (60,62,64) toward the 
curable 

article is sensed as the curable coating material is being cured to 
obtain 

continuous in-process reading. The average radiation value is obtained by 
positioning three longitudinally aligned holes adjacent the fiber path 

and 
between the fiber and a radiation sensing device (70). Furthermore, the 

amount 
of the light energy available from the reflector system (60,62,64) may be 

sensed at a 
location which is outside the reflector system to obtain a reference 

reading. 
The in-process readings may then be compared with the reference reading 

to determine the portion of the radiation available from the radiation 
source 

which is actually available for curing the curable coating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for continuously monitoring 
curing energy levels within a curing unit. Radiation curable materials have penetrated several areas of 
commerce due to their characteristic rapid processing speeds. One class of 
radiation curable materials are converted from a liquid to a solid upon 
exposure to ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such 
materials are commonly referred to as UV curable materials. Examples of 
such materials include UV curable optical fiber coatings, optical fiber 
cabling materials, adhesives, floor coatings, wood coatings, and metal 
beverage can coatings. Another class of radiation curable materials are 
converted from a liquid to a solid upon exposure to visible light. Such 
materials are commonly referred to as visible light curable materials. 
Examples of such materials include optical fiber coatings, pigmented inks, 
and adhesives. A characteristic of all radiation curable materials is that their 
extent of cure is dependent upon the amount of exposed curing radiation, 
referred to as dose. Cure dose is a variable which is sought to be carefully 
controlled during processing of radiation curable materials in order to 
ensure complete cure of the material. Some general methods currently used 
to control radiation curing dose include: 
1. Careful control of processing line speed; 2. Consistent exposure time for fixed substrates; 3. Output power meters for the curing radiation sources; 4. Preventive maintenance of curing radiation source reflector 
systems; 5. Routine replacement of curing radiation sources; and 6. Off-line, destructive quality control inspection of cured 
article to gauge the ultimate degree of cure achieved. One growing area of use for curable materials is as coatings for 
optical fibers. In the manufacture of optical fiber, a preform is suspended 
vertically and moved into a furnace. Optical fiber is drawn from the 
preform and afterwards is provided with one or more layers of various liquid 
coating material. In general, the liquid coating material is a curable coating 
material and typically it is an ultraviolet (UV) light energy curable material. Curing of the coating materials is accomplished by moving 
successive lengths of the optical fiber having the coating material thereon 
through a center tube which is disposed within an elliptically shaped 
housing as depicted in U.S. Patent 5,000,772. At one loci of the elliptical 
shape is disposed a curing lamp; at the other, the center tube. The 
elliptical housing
