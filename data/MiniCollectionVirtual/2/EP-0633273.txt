<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a vinyl chloride polymer comprising 
the steps of charging a vinyl chloride monomer or 

a vinylic monomer mixture containing a vinyl chloride 
monomer, an oil-soluble polymerization initiator, a dispersion 

stabilizer and water into a polymerization vessel, 
and suspension-polymerizing said monomer in an aqueous 

medium, wherein said water is charged into the polymerization 
vessel in a state of pH 2.5-5.0. According to this 

production process, a vinyl chloride polymer having good 
particle size distribution, initial coloration, heat stability, 

demonomering property (removal of monomer) and the 
like is obtained in a broad range of an oxygen amount 

without being affected by the oxygen amount in the polymerization 
vessel. Further, the polymer obtained by the 

production process presents a formed article having fewer 
fish eyes when it is formed. In addition, because an adhesion 

amount of polymer scales to an inner wall of the 
polymerization vessel is extremely less, productivity is 

good.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
vinyl chloride polymers by suspension polymerization. As processes for producing vinyl chloride polymers 
which present molded articles having high porosity, excellent 
processability and fewer fish eyes, there are known 
processes for producing vinyl chloride polymers by suspension 
polymerization using a partially saponified polyvinyl 
alcohol having an average polymerization degree of not 
more than 600 and a saponification degree of not more than 
55 mol% as a dispersion stabilizer (Japanese Patent Laid-open 
(KOKAI) Nos. 52-5886, 55-112210, 53-6392 and 63-264611 
and Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 61-18562 
etc.). However, in the case of the aforementioned processes, 
particle size distribution of an obtained polymer is deficient 
in stability, and for example, if polymerization is 
performed under a condition of a small oxygen amount in a 
polymerization system, coarse particles of a polymer are 
apt to be generated. Further, scales are apt to adhere to 
an inner wall of a polymerization vessel during this event, 
and the obtained polymer is apt to cause fish eyes when it  
 
is processed into a sheet shape. These problems can be 
suppressed to some extent by increasing the oxygen amount 
in the polymerization vessel to about 80 to 200 ppm, however, 
when the oxygen amount is increased in such a manner, 
the obtained polymer undergoes high initial coloration 
upon forming processing, and heat stability lowers. Thus a task of the present invention is to provide a 
process for producing a vinyl chloride polymer comprising 
suspension-polymerizing vinyl chloride or a mixture of 
monomers containing vinyl chloride in an aqueous medium 
containing a dispersion stabilizer, as a process for producing 
vinyl chloride polymers wherein vinyl chloride 
polymers which present formed articles, in which initial 
coloration upon forming processing is less, heat stability 
is good and fewer fish eyes exist even after being processed 
into a sheet shape, can be stably produced in a 
broad oxygen amount range without being affected so much 
by an oxygen amount in a polymerization vessel. As a result of vigorous investigation by the present 
inventors in order to solve the aforementioned task, the 
present invention has been achieved. Namely, the present 
invention provides:
 
   a process for producing a vinyl chloride polymer comprising 
the steps of:
