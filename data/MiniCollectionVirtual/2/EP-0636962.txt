<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for protecting distributed software 
which relies on a unique factor such as an accessible serial number 

or the generation of a profile or fingerprint of the computer of 
the user which is entered individually and/or with a random factor 

to generate a unique first key which will differ for different 
computers. The first key is sent to a processing center which then 

generates a second key. The user applies the second key which 
compares the unique and/or random factors. If the comparison 

matches, the first and second keys are used in an algorithm in the 
software to generate a decrypting key permitting the customer to 

purchase the selected program(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the protection of software,
software transmission, data transmission, etc., and more particularly
to the protection of distributed data from unauthorized use
in contrast to the prevention of copying of programs or protection
of programs by execution control means.Generally, the primary purpose of software protection is
to prevent the duplication and use of a program without the
purchase or payment of a fee. A number of solutions have been
advanced to deal with such problems, e.g., United States Patent
Nos. 4,562,306; 4,932,054 and 5,081,676. All require additional
hardware which probably would not be economically viable in a mass
mailing type distribution of software.A different problem is encountered when some type of
distribution is used to market the program in contrast to direct
point of sale marketing. In one such an arrangement the program
may be mass produced, e.g., records in the form of CD ROMs, and
sent out by a mailing. Such CD ROMs can combine a multiplicity of
independent programs or related programs which may be selected 
individually or in different combinations. The idea is then to
restrict the possibility to use a particular program only to those
willing to pay for that program and to prevent others who have not
obtained authorization from such use. For example, if the user
must call in to get a key which is then used to run a particular
distributed program and this key is the same for all copies of this
program, there is nothing to prevent the caller from simply giving
the key to a third party who then may access the program without
paying for such use.WO 88/02202 discloses a system for controlling and accounting for retrieval of
data from a CD-ROM memory containing encrypted data files from which retrieval
must be authorized. A unique identifier of the user's computer is generated and
sent, together with an identifier of the file requested, to a processing center. It is
checked whether the user is authorized to access the file, based on credit
conditions and user identification. If the user is authorized, a file encryption key is
generated and encrypted with a key that is unique to the user. This information is
read and checked, and the two keys are combined in an algorithm for generating a
decryption key for decrypting the distributed file.US patent 4,796,220 discloses a method for controlling the copying of software in
which an authorized user is allowed to make any number of backup copies of a
computer program and to execute such backup copy on the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The method of protecting mass distributed encrypted software having a
plurality of different programs and program combinations from unauthorized use in

a user's computer in communication through a user with a processing center
which, on receipt of a key specific to the user's computer, provides a key to the

user comprising the steps of:


encrypting each program and program combination on said software using
different encryption keys and different encryption algorithms which accompany

said programs on said software (10),
incorporating in said encrypted software an unencrypted installation utility
which, when applied to a user's computer, derives data specific to the user's

computer from a data file stored in the user's computer (10),
storing the derived data in an installation data file,
generating a first key (K
1
) based on the contents of said installation data file
stored in the user's computer when the unencrypted installation utility accesses

said data file (14),
transmitting the first key (K
1
) to the processing center (14),
calculating at the processing center and retuming a second key (K
2
) to user
(16) for each purchased program or combination of programs,
entering by the user the second key (K
2
) in user's computer (18) which
reads the data file stored in the user's computer, regenerates the derived data and

compares the regenerated derived data with the derived data stored in the
installation data file,
rejecting access to software if the two data sets are identical (18), and
otherwise
combining the first and second keys in an algorithm to provide a distinctive
decrypting key to identify and install the programs ordered (20).
