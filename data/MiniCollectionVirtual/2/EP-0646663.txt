<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a melt-blow spinneret device.
More particularly, it relates to a combined filament type,
melt-blow spinneret device wherein different spinning resins
are respectively and separately extruded through different
spinning nozzles, followed by subjecting the extruded
resins to melt-blow spinning by a high-speed
gas current. By means of the melt-blow spinneret device
of the present invention, microfine combined filaments
are processed into a web, non-woven fabric or molded product
to be used for a mask, filter for precision filtration,
battery separator, hygienic material, heat insulator, etc.The so-called melt-blow spinning wherein a
thermoplastic synthetic resin is extruded through spinning
nozzle plates, accompanied by spouting a high speed gas
onto the extruded unstretched filaments through clearances
provided on both the sides of the spinning nozzle plate,
can afford microfine filaments having a diameter of e.g.
10 µm or less, and also makes it possible to continuously
carry out spinning and production of non-woven fabric.
Hence, the above spinning is an advantageous process for
producing a non-woven fabric of microfine filaments. In recent years, a process of subjecting two different
kinds of polymers to conjugate melt-blow spinning, a process
of subjecting them to combined filament type melt-blow
spinning, and the like have been proposed.As to the so-called conjugate melt-blow spinning,
Japanese patent application laid-open Nos. Sho 60-99057
and Sho 60-99058 disclose a side-by-side type, conjugate
melt-blow spinneret device provided with conduits for
introducing two kinds of polymers from the respective
extruders, into holes connected to the conduits for
combining conjugate components, and an air orifice, and
a spinning process using the device. These patent
applications disclose that it is possible to produce
microfine filaments according to a side-by-side type conjugate
melt-blow spinning process, in combinations of various
heterogeneous polymers such as polypropylene/polyester,
polypropylene/nylon-6, etc.In the case of the spinneret device and the production
process of conjugate filament, disclosed in the above
patent applications, the objective microfine filaments
can be obtained by controlling the temperature, the
retention time of polymers inside the extruders, the polymer
compositions, etc. so that the viscosities of polymers
at the time of passing through the die can be similar.
However, a production of uniform conjugate filaments is
possible only in the case where
