<ABSTRACT>
A jack assembly (12) is provided with a contact 
switching system for receiving a coaxial plug (14). The 

assembly includes an insulative housing (18) having a 
terminal-receiving chamber (26) and an aperture (22a) 

communicating with the chamber for insertion therethrough 
of the coaxial plug. The housing includes a terminal pivot 

support (48a, 56a) in the chamber. A fixed terminal (46, 
54) is mounted on the housing and includes a fixed contact 

portion (46b, 54b) located in the chamber. A movable 
terminal (50, 58) is mounted on the housing and includes a 

cantilevered spring contact arm (50d, 58d) projecting from 
the terminal pivot support for pivoting thereabout. The 

cantilevered spring contact arm includes a first contact 
portion (50c, 58e) for contacting the contact portion of 

the fixed terminal and a second contact portion (50f, 58g) 
for contacting the coaxial plug when inserted into the 

chamber. The spring contact arm is resiliently preloaded 
to bias the first contact portion against the contact 

portion of the fixed terminal. The spring contact arm is 
configured so that the first contact portion slides along 

and wipes over the contact portion of the fixed terminal 
when the coaxial plug is inserted into the chamber and in 

contact with the second contact portion of the movable 
terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a jack assembly 
which includes a contact switching system for receiving a 
coaxial plug. Shielded electrical connector assemblies are 
widely used in various applications such as telecommunications 
equipment, computers and the like. The electrical 
wiring in such applications often include electrical cables 
having a plurality of electrically conductive leads surrounded 
and protected by an electrically conductive shield, 
such as a braid, foil or the like. In most such connector 
assemblies, it is necessary to shield the signal-carrying 
circuits to avoid electromagnetic interference caused by 
energy generated outside as well as inside the system, 
and/or to avoid radio frequency interference entering the 
system. Many such electrical connector assemblies are 
used in conjunction with systems which incorporate printed 
circuit boards to which the connectors are surface-mounted 
or with panels having apertures through which the connectors 
are mounted. Often, either the board or the panel 
have ground planes or plates to which the connectors are 
conductively coupled. The coupling usually is through the 
shield of the connector assemblies. One type of shielded 
electrical connector assembly is a jack which is "box" or 
rectangularly shaped and includes a rectangularly shaped 
dielectric housing having a front face and outside portions  
 
surrounding the front face covered by a stamped and formed 
metal shield. One such application of shielded jacks is for 
receiving a pin-type coaxial plug insertable through a hole 
in the front of the metal shield and into a cavity or chamber 
within the dielectric housing. The coaxial plug has a 
plurality of radially insulated terminals which are exposed 
at a tip of the plug in a fashion to provide axially separated 
terminal sections. The dielectric housing of the 
jack mounts a plurality of pairs of movable contacts or 
terminals and fixed contacts or terminals, with the movable 
contacts being engageable by the terminal sections of an 
inserted plug. The terminal sections of the plug not only 
establish electrical connection with the movable contacts, 
but the plug moves the movable contacts away from the fixed 
contacts to effect contact switching functions. One of the 
problems with jacks of this type is to maintain or ensure 
good electrical contact between the movable and fixed contacts. 
The engaging surfaces of the contacts often become 
contaminated which
