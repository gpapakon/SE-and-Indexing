<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRIC TAPE FENCING CONNECTORField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method and means for installing and/or repairing electric tape fencing.Background to the InventionElectric tape fencing is a comparatively recent development in fencing technology primarily for enclosing grazing animals. An example of the electric tape used in this fencing is disclosed in PCT/WO82/04378. The tape is woven from a plurality of resilient force-absorbing textile threads having electrically conductive threads inter-woven and extending longitudinally of the tape.Various means exist for supporting the tape from electrically insulated support posts. An example of such a support is disclosed in US4866218. However none of these means are suitable for joining lengths of the tape when installing or repairing the electric tape fencing whereas commercial electric fencing tape strainers, or tensioning devices, exist these are incapable of repairing broken fencing tape. Great difficulty and inconvenience can be experienced when attempting to join together two lengths of the tape to achieve suitable tension and good electrical conductivity therebetween.It is one general objective of the present invention to overcome the above problem and provide an efficient method and means for joining together 

 lengths of electric fencing tape to achieve suitable tension and good electrical conductivity, when installing or repairing electric tape fencing. The tensiomng is especially important to prevent wind damage to the tape.It is a yet further general objective of the present invention to provide an improved method and means for conveniently fastening and tensioning a length of electric fencing tape to a supporting member.Summary of the InventionAccording to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a component of an electric tape fence installation and/or repair system for joining lengths of tape which comprises:a connector body comprising a pair of clamp elements, moveable relative to each other to enable an end of a length of electric fencing tape to be passed therebetween and the tape to then be clamped flat therebetween, and incorporating means guiding the tape into the clamp in use and means to facilitate electrical continuity between a first length of electric fencing tape clamped in the connector body and a second length of electric tape clamped in the connector body.Preferably the pair of clamp elements are formed integrally; either in the sense that they comprise respective portions of a one-piece

 CLAIMS:
1. A component of an electric tape fence installation and/or repair system for joining lengths of tape which comprises:
a connector body comprising a pair of clamp elements, movable relative to each other to enable an end of a length of electric fencing tape to be passed therebetween and the tape to then be clamped flat therebetween, and incorporating means guiding the tape into the clamp in use and means to facilitate electrical continuity between a- j first length of electric fencing tape clamped in the connector body andajj second length of electric fencing tape clamped in the connector body.
2. A component as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the connector body is electro-conductive, being of an electro conductive material or having one or more electro-conductive elements extending such that electrical contact may be made between the connector body and each electrical fencing tape clamped therein and to conduct electricity from the first length of tape to the second length of tape.
3. A component as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the clamp elements are fixed together or moved apart by traction through contact with the electric fencing tape therebetween.
4. A component as claimed in Claim 3, wherein one of said pair of clamp elements is pivotally- mounted to the connector body in an over-centre arrangement such that in one direction of pivotal movement the said element will wedge a fencing tape fitted within the connector body against the other clamp element, and in the other direction of pivotal movement, the said clamp element will release the said fencing tape.
5. A component as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the connector body comprises three clamp elements, the first of which is electro 


conductive and extends longitudinally between the respective free ends of a pair of lengths of electric fencing tape to be joined, the other two clamp elements extending transversely of the first clamp element to clamp a respective one of said pair of ends to the first clamp element.
6. A component as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the connector body is provided with support post attachment means.
7. A component as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the support post attachment means insulates the connector body from the post in use-
8. A component as claimed in Claims 6 or 7 wherein the support post attachment means is detachably mountable to the connector body.
9. A component as claimed in any preceding claim wherein locking means are provided to lock the pivotal clamp elements in their clamping state.
10. A method of installing and/or repairing electric tape fencing which comprises the steps of:
providing the apparatus of the present invention;
passing an end of a first length of electric fencing tape between the clamping faces of the pair of clamp elements; passing an end of a second length of electric fencing tape to be joined to the first length of electric fencing tape between the clamping faces of the said pair of or another pair of said clamp elements on the connector body; and
clamping the said ends within the connector body securely and such as to enable electrical conduction. 


11, An electric tape fence connector substantially as hereinbefore described, with reference to any suitable combination of the accompanying drawings.
