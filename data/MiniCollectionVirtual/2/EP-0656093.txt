<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed to equip ladders with a supporting head during their manufacture or to retrofit existing ladders with supports (100). The support (100) is designed as a multifunctional head. The support (100) with specially designed supporting claws (20) not only allows ladders to be set against straight walls, inner and outer edges, without the need for exchanging apparatus, but also reduces the risk of accidents during almost all operations carried out on a ladder, without damaging the wall. The new invention may be very advantageously used in and at buildings, vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, etc. Bridging rails (205, 205') allow the support (100) to be mounted in a few seconds on almost all existing light ladders. A new adapting or bridging piece (51) is provided with a fixing slot (50) for fastening the support (100) to ladders of any width. Also disclosed is a kit for retrofitting existing ladders, in which even the bridging piece has already many advantages as it provides a surface for supporting the ladder on flat walls.

action of the contact faces (26) being arranged in a

transverse plane (10) to the two uprights (6, 6') which
assumes an angle (β) preferably of about 110° to the uprights

so the contact faces (26) contact the wall (5) over their
entire area in use or the contact faces (26) adopt an angle β

(= β x 90°) (Figure 11a).
Fastening device according to one of claims 6 or 7,
characterized in that the contact faces (26) are formed on

individual elastic shaped parts (27), in particular on rubber
peg-like exchangeable adhesive elements which form an annular

contact face (26).
Fastening device according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the adapters (51) each have a fixing

slot extending parallel to the rungs (7) and form two
articulations (50) for a positioning support (100). 
Positionable ladder (1) which has, at its upper
positioning ends (3) of the ladder uprights (6, 6'), a

respective articulation which is formed in the ends of the
uprights, a respective fixing slot (50, 106) which mates with

a bridging rail (105, 205) bridging the uprights being formed
in the articulations, and a quick-release securing device (47,

67 , 45, 107), in particular a straining screw, being provided
in order to secure the bridging rail to the fixing slot.
Positionable ladder according to claim 10, characterized
in that it comprises a supporting head or a positioning

support (17, 100), the bridging rail (105, 205) being
connecting means on the supporting head or on the positioning

support (17, 100) ) for compensating positioiiable, extending or
double ladders of various widths.
Positianable ladder according to claim 11, characterized
in that the positioning support or the supporting head ( 17,
