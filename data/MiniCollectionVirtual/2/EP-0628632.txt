<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microbial protease 
inhibitors and, specifically, to protein protease 
inhibitors produced by Streptomyces, which are 
structurally related to Streptomyces Subtilisin Inhibitor, 
and cloned genes and uses thereof in recombinant DNA 
processes. Protein protease inhibitors appear to play a role 
in regulation of protease functions in living organisms 
and cells. Such protease inhibitors are widely 
distributed in animals and plants. Exemplary of these are 
alpha-l-antiprotease, soybean trypsin inhibitor, bovine 
pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and antithrombin. 
Microbially produced protein protease inhibitors include a 
family of dimeric proteins, each 10 to 12 kilodaltons  
 
(kd). This family includes SSI, alkaline protease 
inhibitor (API-2) from S.griseoincarnatus, 
plasminostreptin (PSN) from S.antifibrinolyticus and a 
protease inhibitor from Streptoverticiliumcinnamoneum. 
The inhibitors of the SSI family share extensive sequence 
homology, e.g., about 70% between SSI and PSN, but appear 
to have different protease specificities. See, generally, 
"Protein Protease Inhibitors - The Case of Streptomyces 
Subtilisin Inhibitor (SSI)", edited by Hiromi et al., 
Elsevier, 1985, pages 1-14, 139-161 and 365-395. Kakinuma 
et al., U.S. Patent 4,014,860, disclose PSN and a 
producing strain thereof. Protein protease inhibitors have medical 
application such as in treatment of lung tissue 
degradation caused by deficiency in alpha-l-antiprotease. 
Protein protease inhibitors can also be utilized to 
prevent protein degradation caused by proteases such as 
are present in serum. Wilson, EP-A-113,319, report use of 
Erythrina trypsin inhibitor to inhibit conversion of one 
chain tissue plasminogen activator to the two chain form 
which occurs in a presence of serum. Streptomyces are an attractive host for 
production of desired polypeptides by recombinant DNA 
techniques because they possess the necessary cellular 
"machinery" to export proteins and because a great deal of 
experience in culturing Streptomyces for antibiotic 
production has been acquired. A problem which has been encountered in 
production of heterologous proteins in Streptomyces is 
protein degradation by endogenous proteases. A second 
problem which has been encountered is in obtaining export 
signal sequences which can be fused to heterologous coding 
sequences to direct export of heterologous gene products. Furthermore, it is desirable to obtain regulatory 
regions, e.g., promoters, ribosome binding sites and  
 
trans
