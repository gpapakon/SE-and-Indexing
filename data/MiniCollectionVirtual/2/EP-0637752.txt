<ABSTRACT>
Generally U-shaped contact elements (11) mounted in a socket 
body (2) each has a flexible portion (13), a generally 

U-shaped bent portion (14) which bends approximately 180° and a 
contact portion (15). A head (31) which supports an IC package 

(21) moves toward the main socket body (2) to mount the IC 
package (21) in socket (1). Immediately before reaching the 

mounting position of the IC package, an arm (9) of a lever (7), 
rotatably journaled in the socket body (2), is pushed by head 

(31) rotating lever (7). Arm (10) of lever (7), sandwiched 
between the contact flexible portion (13) and the lower end of 

the contact portion (15), rotates therewith pressing contact 
portions (15) against leads (26) of the IC package, thereby 

effecting an electric connection between the two.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a socket having means to 
make electrical connection with leads of an electronic device 
received in the socket and more specifically to a socket having 
electrical contact elements which, in connection with the 
insertion of a semiconductor integrated circuit package (which 
will hereafter be referred to as an IC package), makes electrical 
contact by biasing the contact elements against leads of the IC 
package and to a socket which is suitable for IC package testing, 
in particular, electrical property testing. A conventional socket for use in test apparatus for testing 
various electrical properties of an IC package is shown in Figure 
1. Contacts 101 are fixedly mounted on both sides of a main 
socket body 92. A fixed body portion 102 of each contact 101 has 
a U-shape with a bar shaped flexible portion 103 extending 
upwardly from the center of the body portion thereof. A wide 
contact portion 105 is provided at the tip of flexible portion 
103 for engagement with a lead of an IC package. A terminal leg 
106 protrudes from the lower side of the fixed body portion 102 
and extends through the bottom wall of main socket body 92 and is 
received through a bore of a printed circuit substrate (PCB) 30 
of the test apparatus (not shown in the drawing) to fixedly mount 
socket 91 to PCB 30. IC package 21 has generally J-shaped leads 26 on both right 
and left sides as seen in the figure, and is supported by a head  
 
31 which has been provided in the test apparatus in such a manner 
as to be able to move in alternating opposite directions. IC 
package 21 is mounted in main socket body 92, as shown in the 
figure, as a result of forward movement of head 31. In this position, leads 26 push contact portions 105 of 
contacts 101 outwardly toward the right and left sides 
respectively. As the flexible portions 103 of the contacts are 
elasticaily deformed, the contact portions 105 press against 
leads 26 by the spring return force thereby making an electric 
connection. In this manner, leads 26 of IC package 21 are 
connected to a prescribed electrical circuit in the test 
apparatus through contacts 101 and PCB 30. The procedural steps for mounting the IC package in the 
socket are shown in Figures 2(a) - 2(d) with only the left side 
being shown as a cross section since both sides are symmetrical. 
Figure 2(a) shows the socket prior to mounting the IC package in 
the socket. Figure 2(b) shows the structure when the lead of the 
IC package has just engaged the contact

<CLAIMS>
Socket apparatus for mounting IC units having a 
plurality of leads comprising, 

   a body member having a center and having opposed sides, 
a plurality of contact elements mounted on at least one opposed 

side of the body member aligned with respective leads of an IC 
unit to be received therein, each contact element having a 

flexible, elongated contact portion having a first surface facing 
the center of the body member and a second opposite surface 

facing away from the center of the body member, 
   a lever means pivotably mounted in the body member and 

having a first arm disposed in alignment with each contact 
portion on a side of the contact portion facing the second, 

opposite surface, the lever means having a second arm with a 
distal end portion, 

   a movable head member movable between a first IC unit 
loading position and a second IC unit mounting position, the head 

member having an IC unit receiving seat, IC leads of an IC unit 
disposed on the IC unit receiving seat moving into engagement 

with the first surface of respective contact portions as the head 
member moves from the first position toward the second position 

applying a first contact force on the leads, the head member 
engaging the distal end portion of the second arm when the head 

member is proximate to the second IC mounting position so that 
continued movement of the head member to the second IC mounting 

position causes the lever means to pivot concomitantly moving the 
first arms against the second surface of respective contact 

 
portions and toward respective IC unit leads applying a second 

force on each IC unit lead for a total contact loading at the 
mounting position. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 1 in which each 
contact element is generally U-shaped having first and second 

legs joined by a bight portion, the first leg being mounted on 
the body member and the second leg forming the flexible, 

elongated contact portion. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 2 in which the first 
arms of the lever means are sandwiched between first and second 

legs of respective contact elements. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 1 in which the 
contact elements are mounted on opposed sides of the body member. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 4 in which the lever 
means includes a lever element provided for the contact elements 

of each opposed side. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 1 in which the first 
contact force comprises approximately 40 percent of the total 

contact loading at the mounting position. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 1 in which the 
second contact force comprises approximately 60 percent of the 

total contact loading at the mounting position. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 6 in which the 
second contact force comprises approximately 60 percent of the 

total contact loading at the mounting position. 
Socket apparatus according to claim 2 in which an 
inclined surface portion is formed between each contact portion 

and the respective bight portion.
