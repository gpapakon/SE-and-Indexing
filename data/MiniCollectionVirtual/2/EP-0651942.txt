<ABSTRACT>
A tag for meat, suitable in particular for use as an ear 
tag for livestock, such as pigs and cattle, sheep and goats, 

which tag comprises an insertion element (2), a counterelement (3) and 
recognition means (1), the insertion element comprising at least a 

metal tubular element (7) provided at one end with a supporting 
surface (8) extending substantially at right angles to the axis 

thereof and at the other end with a tapered portion (10) provided 
at the free end with a cutting edge, the counterface (3) being 

provided with an opening (17) through which it can be arranged 
fittingly over the tapered portion (10) at some distance from the 

supporting surface (8) , in such a manner that it can be secured 
thereto fittingly. The recognition means (1) are constituted by a 

one-piece synthetic tag plate provided at the exterior with a 
positive printing, which tag plate is, at least in mounted 

condition, rigidly connected to one of the parts of the tag 
with sealing effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tag for meat, 
suitable in particular for use as an ear tag for livestock, 
such as pigs and cattle, sheep and goats, which tag comprises 
an insertion element, a counterelement and recognition means, 
the insertion element comprising at least a metal tubular 
element provided at one end with a supporting surface 
extending substantially at right angles to the axis thereof 
and at the other end with a tapered portion provided at the 
free end with a cutting edge, the counterface being provided 
with an opening through which it can be arranged fittingly 
over the tapered portion at some distance from the supporting 
surface in such a manner that it can be secured thereto 
fittingly. Such a tag is supplied by Nederlandse Metaal- en 
Kunststofwarenfabriek Record B.V. at Velp (NL). In the known tag the recognition means consist of a 
tag plate composed of a number of different layers, at least a 
supporting surface and a transparent film located at the 
outside being included. At the side facing the supporting 
plate the film is provided with a negative printing, and the 
supporting plate is provided with a recognition color. The 
insertion member is composed of a tubular element provided at 
one end with a collar and a somewhat tray-shaped receiving 
member provided with a central opening in the bottom. In 
mounted condition the tubular element extends through the 
opening, the collar abutting at the interior against the 
bottom of the tray-shaped receiving member. The composed tag 
plate is secured in the receiving member by beading the  
 
circumferential edge thereof around the tag plate. Thus, the 
insertion member is also attached. This known tag is arranged in an ear, e.g., in the 
manner described below. The insertion member and the countermember are laid in 
a special pair of tongs, after which the ear is received 
between the cutting edge of the tapered portion and the 
countermember. By closing the pair of tongs the cutting edge, 
and thus the tubular element, is pressed through the ear, 
providing a passage having a clean surface against which only 
the metal outer wall of the tubular element fittingly abuts. 
No hairs or such filth are received between the outer wall of 
the tubular element and the surface of the passage actually 
consisting of exposed meat which is therefore susceptible to 
infection. Moreover, with this tag synthetic parts thereof are 
prevented from coming into contact with the surface of the 
passage, which is of special importance with

<CLAIMS>
A tag for meat, suitable in particular for use as an 
ear tag for livestock, such as pigs and cattle, sheep and 

goats, which tag comprises an insertion element, a 
counterelement, and recognition means, the insertion element 

comprising at least a metal tubular element provided at one 
end with a supporting surface extending substantially at right 

angles to the axis thereof and at the other end with a tapered 
portion provided at the free end with a cutting edge, the 

counterface being provided with an opening through which it 
can be arranged fittingly over the tapered portion at some 

distance from the supporting surface, in such a manner that it 
can be secured thereto fittingly, characterized in that the 

recognition means are constituted by a one-piece synthetic tag 
plate provided at the exterior with a positive printing, which 

tag plate is, at least in mounted condition, rigidly connected 
to one of the parts of the tag with sealing effect. 
A tag according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
printing is embossed. 
A tag according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the insertion member is made in one piece. 
A tag according to any of claims 1 - 3, characterized 
in that the supporting surface or the counterface is provided 

with a raised outer edge, the tag plate being fittingly 
received within the outer edge and the upper part of the outer 

edge being bent grippingly over the longitudinal edge of the 
tag plate at the top surface thereof. 
A tag according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the tag plate is attached at least by 

gluing. 
A tag according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the tag plate is provided with a click-fit 

edge which can cooperate with a counteredge of the 
insertion member or the countermember, the counteredge being a 

cutting edge, in such a manner that when a loosening force is 
exerted on the tag plate in the direction of the top surface 

thereof the tag plate is damaged by the cutting counteredge. 
A tag according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the tag plate is provided at the bottom 

side with a rod-shaped element extending substantially at 
right angles thereto, which element is fittingly received in 

the tubular element. 
A tag according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
rod-shaped element is provided at the free end with a 

thickened portion abutting against the exterior of one of the 
ends of the tubular element. 
A tag according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
thickened portion extends over a part of the counterelement 

and abuts against the cutting edge of the tubular element, in 
such a manner that when a loosening force is exerted on the 

tag plate in the direction of the top surface thereof the 
thickened portion is damaged by the cutting edge. 
A tag according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the tag plate is integrated with the 

counterface. 
A tag according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the tag plate is provided with an 

opening fittingly arranged over the tapered portion, which
