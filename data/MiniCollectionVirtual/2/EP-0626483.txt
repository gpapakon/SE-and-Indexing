<ABSTRACT>
An improved pipeline padding apparatus (10) includes (18) a separator 
for separating fine material (26) 

out of spoil (24) which is piled along side an excavation (22), 
an elevator (16) 

for transporting spoil to the 
separator, and a pair of spaced-apart guide projections (12) for guiding 

spoil into the elevator. The 
spaced-apart guide projections (12) form a substantially open bottom 

extending the width of the 
elevator (16) between the guide projections (12). A conveyor (20) 

is provided 
to transport the separated fine 

portion (26) of the spoil (24) back into the excavation (22), 
thereby padding 

the pipeline. The separator (18) , the 
elevator (16), the guide projections (12), 

and the vehicle (10) are all mounted 
on a support vehicle (28). 

According to one aspect of the invention, one or more rotary 
feeder assemblies is mounted to 

the guide projections (12) for assisting in moving spoil (24) through 
toward the elevator (18). The rotary 

feeder assemblies (13) have a low profile so that spoil material 
and rocks do not become stuck as 

they move toward the elevator. In another aspect of the invention, 
the motor of the tracked 

support vehicle (28) is mounted above and forward of the elevator (16), 
which helps reduce the amount 

of dust that the motor is exposed to during operation. According 
to another aspect of the 

invention, the guide projections (12) may be configured to allow 
excess spoil to flow underneath in 

such a manner as to smooth out a path for the tracks (128) of the 
support vehicle (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for padding pipe. More particularly, the
invention relates to improvements in pipeline padding apparatus that more efficiently collects
and loads earth material for processing into padding material for padding a pipeline.A large demand exists in contemporary society for underground piping, which is used
to convey fluids from one location to another. The pipeline is buried to protect it, and it is also
usually coated with a plastic or other protective material to extend the life of the pipeline by
preventing corrosion.To lay an underground pipeline, a back hoe, trencher or the like is used to create an
excavated trench, and the excavated soil and rock, which is commonly called spoil, is piled to
one side of the excavation. The pipeline is then laid in the excavation. After the pipeline is
laid in the excavation, it must be covered with earth material. However, it is important that 
rocks in the spoil do not come into contact with the pipeline, which could breach the protective
coating and cause unnecessary corrosion of the pipeline. For this reason, it is common to fill
in a portion of the excavation surrounding the pipeline with fine material, which is commonly
called padding material. In the past, sand or other fine material usually had to be purchased
from remote locations and hauled great distances to the pipeline location for this purpose.
However, sand padding is labor intensive, and it also requires many trucks and loaders, which
can cause problems along the narrow right-of-way of the pipeline project.More recently, pipeline padding machines, such as disclosed in US-A-5120433,
US-A-4633602 have been developed that move along the pile
of excavated spoil and continuously collect spoil material, separate from the spoil fine material
suitable for pipe padding, and convey the padding material into the excavation to pad the
pipeline. These earlier padding machines were an improvement over sand hauling sand
padding, however, the costs associated with pipeline construction and pipeline padding are
considerable, and every increase in efficiency can translate to large savings in time and labor.For example, the pipeline environment can present excavated spoil that is wet, sticky,
and rocky, such spoil being difficult to load onto the machines for processing into padding
material. Such spoil conditions can slow down the padding process. Thus, there is a need for
improved padding apparatus that has better material handling ability and is more efficient at
collecting
