<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a highly purified acetic acid, which 

contains reducing substances in trace amounts and 
exhibits a satisfactory result in the permanganate 

reducing substance test, comprising the step of 
continuously reacting an aqueous solution of methanol 

and/or methyl acetate with carbon monoxide in a 
reactor, the step of continuously withdrawing a 

reaction fluid from the reactor and the step of 
evaporating the withdrawn reaction fluid in an 

evaporator to thereby obtain vaporous components 
containing acetic acid and distilling the vaporous 

components in a distillation column while withdrawing 
an overhead from the distillation column at its top, 

characterized in that the overhead is treated with 
ozone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an industrial 
process for producing a highly purified acetic acid. 
More particularly, the present invention is concerned 
with a process for continuously producing acetic acid 
having a lowered content of reducing impurities. Acetic acid is a basic chemical which is used in 
large quantity in the petrochemical industry, organic 
chemical industry, pharmaceutical and agricultural 
chemical producing industry, polymer chemical industry 
and the like. Various industrial processes are known for 
producing acetic acid. Among them, the process which 
comprises continuously reacting methanol with carbon 
monoxide to thereby produce acetic acid [see Herbert 
D. Grove, Hydrocarbon Process No. 11, 76 (1972)] is 
the most industrially advantageous one. According to 
this process, not only is the productivity of acetic 
acid high, but also the production of by-product  
 
impurities is reduced. Therefore, when acetic acid is 
produced by this process, acetic acid having a purity 
higher than those of the acetic acids produced by 
other processes can be obtained. However, even if the above process is adopted, 
trace impurities are produced as the by-products. 
Accordingly, when a continuous operation is performed 
for a prolonged period of time even though acetic acid 
is produced according to the above process, by-product 
impurities contaminate acetic acid as the target 
product to thereby degrade the quality of the product. 
Therefore, even if the above process is adopted, large 
facilities are used and much energy is consumed for 
purification of acetic acid. In recent years, a process with respect to the 
improvement of the catalyst for the production of 
acetic acid in which a catalyst stabilizer, such as an 
iodide salt, is added and another process in which 
methanol is reacted with carbon monoxide under such a 
condition that water content is lower than that of the 
prior art have been proposed as industrial processes 
for producing acetic acid at high productivity. It is 
stated that the amounts of by-products, such as carbon 
dioxide and propionic acid, are reduced when any of 
such processes is  
 
employed alone or such processes are employed in 
combination. However, as to some impurities produced 
as by-products in trace amounts, other than carbon 
dioxide and propionic acid, the amounts thereof are 
increased in accordance with an increase in the 
productivity of acetic acid. Therefore, when the 
productivity of acetic acid is enhanced by the above 
catalyst
