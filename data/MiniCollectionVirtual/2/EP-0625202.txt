Human serum albumin resulting from the
expression, in a yeast of the genus Kluyveromyces, of

an exogenous DNA sequence and possessing a colorimetric
index of less than 0.2, capable of being obtained using

the process for preparing the said human serum albumin
comprising the following steps:


in a first step, an exogenous DNA encoding
human serum albumin under the control of transcriptional

and translational signals appropriate to the
host used is introduced into a host cell,
in a second step, the cell thus obtained is
cultured in a medium of defined composition containing

at least one carbon source chosen from alcohols, nonreducing
sugars, organic acids and glucose derivatives

substituted on the oxygen of the carbon C4; or in a
medium prepared so as to remove or limit the formation

of aldehyde type impurities, and,
in a third step, the HSA produced is
recovered.
Human serum albumin according to Claim 1,
characterized in that it has a colorimetry index of

less than 0.15.
Human serum albumin according to Claim 2,
characterized in that it has a colorimetry index of

less than 0.1.
Human serum albumin according to any one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the exogenous DNA 

is chosen from the cDNA sequences, the genomic DNA
sequences and the hybrid sequences encoding HSA.
Human serum albumin according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the exogenous DNA comprises a

region for initiation of transcription and translation
joined to the 5' end of the sequence encoding HSA.
Human serum albumin according to any one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the exogenous DNA

is part of a vector, which may be one affording
autonomous or integrative replication.
Human serum albumin according to any one of
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that it results from

the expression, in a yeast of the genus Kluyveromyces,
of an exogenous DNA sequence and from the secretion of

the product of expression of the said sequence into the
culture medium.
Human serum albumin according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the exogenous DNA sequence

comprises, upstream of the sequence encoding the mature
HSA, a "leader" sequence directing the nascent protein

in the secretory pathways of the host used.
Human serum albumin according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the exogenous DNA sequence

comprises, in the 5'-3' direction, a region for
initiation of transcription and translation, a "leader"

sequence directing the nascent protein in the secretory
pathways of the host cell used, and a cDNA encoding

human serum albumin.
Human serum albumin according in either of
Claims 8 and 9, characterized in that the "leader"

sequence may be the natural "leader" sequence of HSA, a
heterologous "leader" sequence, or an artificial

"leader" sequence.
Process for preparing human serum albumin
having a colorimetry index of less than 0.2,

characterized in that the following steps are
performed: 


in a first step, an exogenous DNA encoding
human serum albumin under the control of

transcriptional and translational signals appropriate
to the host used is introduced into a eucaryotic or

procaryotic host cell,
in a second step, the cell thus obtained is
cultured in a medium of defined composition containing

at least one carbon source chosen from alcohols,
non-reducing sugars, organic acids and glucose

derivatives substituted on the oxygen the carbon C4;
or in a medium prepared so as to remove or limit the

formation of aldehyde type impurities, and,
in a third step, the HSA produced is
recovered.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the exogenous DNA is defined as in one of

Claims 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10.
Process according to Claim 12, characterized
in that the HSA is secreted into the culture medium.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the eucaryotic host is chosen from animal

cells, yeasts and fungi.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the procaryotic host is chosen from the

bacteria 
E. coli
, 
Bacillus
 and 
Streptomyces
.
Process according to Claim 14, characterized
in that the host is chosen from yeasts of the genus


Saccharomyces,
Kluyveromyces,

, 
Schwanniomyces

and 
Hansenula
.
Process according to Claim 16, characterized
in that the host is chosen from the yeasts of the genus


Kluyveromyces.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the alcohol may, be chosen from simple alcohols

containing at least two carbon atoms and polyalcohols.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the glucose derivatives are chosen from 

disaccharides, and preferably from the disaccharides
having a 1-4 type glycoside bond.
