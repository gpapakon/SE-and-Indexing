<ABSTRACT>
The terminating arrangement for optical fibres for connecting telecommunications and data communication devices comprises two cassettes (1 and 2) preferably connected to one another in a detachable manner and in each case forming a plane, the inner space of the one cassette (1) serving to accommodate an operating and splicing reserve of a bundle tube and the inner space of the other cassette (2) serving to accommodate operating and splicing reserves of pigtails, which cassettes (1 and 2) are surrounded by a housing (5) which is at least partly closed at the top by a cover plate (6) which carries an adaptor (9) which is covered by a hood (8) and is fitted with plugs. This results in a terminating arrangement for optical fibres, permitting simple connection of telecommunications and data communication devices in offices and at home without increasing the contact resistance of the fibre-optic cable.
