<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for illuminating the fundus of an eye 
with a scanned sample beam of radiation, the scanned sample 

beam emerging from a beam scanner which is exposed to a 
sample beam, which apparatus is for use in optical coherence 

tomography. An embodiment of the apparatus includes: a 
scanner lens and a beamsplitter for transferring radiation 

from the scanned sample beam, including chief rays of the 
sample beam which emerge from a point of final deflection of 

the beam scanner, and (b) lens focusing the transferred 
radiation so that the scanned sample beam is focused onto the 

fundus by the eye. In accordance with the invention the 
scanner lens is fixed with respect to the beam scanner so 

that the point of final deflection is located substantially 
in the back focal plane of the scanner lens and the scanner 

lens is movable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method and
apparatus for optical coherence tomographic ("OCT") fundus
imaging.At present, two techniques of reflectometry are
undergoing intensive research and development efforts, the
two techniques being optical time domain reflectometry
("OTDR") and optical coherence domain reflectometry ("OCDR").
OTDR is an optical analog of radar and sonar. In accordance
with OTDR, short light pulses having pulse durations in
picoseconds, or even femtoseconds, are emitted from a
suitable laser source and impinge upon a sample. The light
pulses are reflected from various structures comprising the
sample and the reflected pulses are detected by a time
resolving detector. The distance between each reflecting 
surface of the sample and the detector is determined by
reason of its proportionality to the time of flight of the
light pulses from the light source to the reflecting surface
and back again. In practice, the detection system can be a
nonlinear, optical, cross correlation apparatus such as that
described in an article entitled "Femtosecond Optical Ranging
in Biological Systems" by J. G. Fujimoto et al., published in
Optics Letters, Vol. 10., No. 3, March 1986, pp. 150-152. As
described in the article, a beam of light reflected from the
sample is superimposed upon a light pulse train emitted by
the source in a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical
pathlength of the reference beam is varied by moving a
reference mirror which is mounted on a translation stage.The resolution of the OTDR technique can be further
improved by an optical coherence domain reflectometry
("OCDR") technique which is described, for example, in an
article entitled "New Measurement System for Fault Location
in Optical Waveguide Devices Based on an Interferometric
Technique" by K. Takada et al., published in Applied Optics,
Vol. 26, No. 9, May 1, 1987, pp. 1603-1606. In accordance
with OCDR, a broad band, continuous wave source is used (in
accordance with OTDR a pulsed light source is used). As
shown in Section 7.5.8 of a book entitled "Principles of
Optics," 6th Edition, M. Born and E. Wolf, Pergamon Press,
New York (1986), the coherence length L of the broad band,
continuous wave light source is related to its bandwidth B by
the following equation:
L = c/B
where c is the velocity of light. In accordance with OCDR,
output from the source is separated into two beams by a
beamsplitter. One of the beams impinges upon a mirror which
is referred to below as a reference mirror. The other one of 
the beams is directed
