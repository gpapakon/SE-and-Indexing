<ABSTRACT>
An antiskid brake apparatus for a vehicle 
comprises a braking mechanism (2) for braking wheels of a 

vehicle, a master cylinder assembly (22) operated in response 
to a brake operation force and adapted to brake the wheels 

through the braking mechanism, a sensor (7) for detecting a 
rotating speed of the wheels, a direction control valve (3) 

disposed on a fluid passage (8,9) connecting the master cylinder 
assembly (22) and the braking mechanism, a pressure reducing 

cylinder assembly (23) which is operatively connected to the 
direction control valve, a pump unit (5) connected through a 

fluid passage (14) between the master cylinder assembly (22) and the 
pressure reducing cylinder assembly (23) for returning the 

hydraulic oil from the pressure reducing cylinder assembly (23) 
to the master cylinder assembly (22), and a control unit (6) for 

detecting a sign of locking of the wheels in accordance 
with an input from the sensor (7). The pressure reducing 

cylinder assembly (23) has a capacity smaller than a hydraulic 
oil discharge capacity corresponding to a full stroke of 

the master cylinder assembly (22). A pressure cut valve (122) is 
further connected to the master cylinder assembly (22) and the 

pump unit (5) through fluid passages for cutting a pump 
pressure of the pump unit with respect to the master 

cylinder assembly (22) and the pressure cut valve (122) is operatively 
connected to the braking mechanism (2) through a fluid passage (8,9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antiskid 
braking apparatus for a vehicle according to the 
pre-characterizing part of claim 1. Figs. 6A and 6B are structural views which 
illustrate a usual antiskid braking apparatus for use in an 
automobile or a motorcycle. The antiskid braking apparatus 
100 comprises a master cylinder 1, a braking mechanism 2 
for braking the rotations of wheels, a direction control 
valve 3, a pressure reducing valve 4, a pump unit 5, a 
control means 6 and a wheel-speed sensor 7 for detecting 
the rotational speed of the wheels. When braking force is applied to the master 
cylinder 1 from a brake pedal or a brake lever, an internal 
piston 1a disposed in the master cylinder 1 is pushed in as 
shown in Fig. 6B so that hydraulic oil (brake fluid) 
enclosed in the master cylinder 1 is discharged. On the 
other hand, the braking mechanism 2 comprises a disc rotor 
2a so formed as to be integrally rotated with the wheel and 
a brake caliper 2b holding the disc rotor 2a. The master cylinder 1 is connected to the 
direction control valve 3 via a fluid passage 8, the 
direction control valve 3 being connected to the brake  
 
caliper 2b via a fluid passage 9. The fluid passage 8 and 
the fluid passage 9 are connected to each other by a fluid 
passage 11. A check valve 12 for permitting only a flow of 
the hydraulic oil that returns from the brake caliper 2b to 
the master cylinder 1 is connected to an intermediate 
position in the fluid passage 11. The pressure reducing valve 4 is connected to the 
direction control valve 3 via a fluid passage 13. The fluid 
passage 13 and the fluid passage 8 are connected to each 
other through a fluid passage 14. The pump unit 5 includes 
a pump 5a connected to an intermediate position of the 
fluid passage 14. Check valves 15 and 16 for permitting 
only flow of the hydraulic oil that returns from the 
pressure reducing cylinder 4 to the master cylinder 1 are 
connected to the upstream and down stream sides of the 
pump 5a with respect to the flow of the fluid. The pump 
unit 5 is also equipped with a motor 5b for operating the 
pump 5a. The control means 6 is wired to a solenoid 3a for 
operating the direction control valve 3, the motor 5b and 
the wheel-speed sensor 7. An antiskid apparatus of this type 
is disclosed in DE-A-41 11 165. When the brake pedal or the brake lever of a 
vehicle is operated in the state shown in Fig. 6A, the 
hydraulic oil in the master cylinder 1 is, under pressure, 
fed to the brake caliper 2b via the fluid passage 8
