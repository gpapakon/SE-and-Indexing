<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Bremia lactucae resistance cultivated in lettuce (i.e. 
Lactuca sativa) plants. The fungus, Bremia lactucae, is the causative agent of the disease "Downy mildew" 
which affects large numbers of crop lettuces annually. Lettuce breeders have been 
trying for many years to breed lettuces which display resistance to this fungus and 
have met with only partial success with respect to the incorporation of a general 
Bremia lactucae resistance in agronomically important lettuce plants. A feature of Bremia lactucae is that it is able to develop new strains over relatively 
short time intervals. New strains of Bremia lactucae are continuing to appear. 
Currently, there are at least sixteen (16) so-called NL races of Bremialactucae known 
(36e Beschrijvende Rassenlijst voor Groentegewassen voor de Teelt onder Glas (1992) 
Eds. Aalbersberg IJ and Stolk J H, Centrum voor Plantenverdelings en 
Reproductieonderzoek, Wageningen) and other races of Bremia lactucae are 
identified (Bonnier F J M et al (1992) Euphytica 61: 203-211). Known commercial 
lettuce varieties which do display resistance to some Bremia lactucae strains typically 
comprise dominant resistant (Dm) genes in their genomes, which genes are thought to 
operate in a gene-for-gene system wherein the Dm gene or genes correspond with 
dominant avirulence genes of the pathogen (Bonnier supra). Dm is the abreviation for 
downy mildew; the capital letter D indicates that the gene is dominant. As long as a 
resistance factor has not been proved to be due to a single gene, it is characterised by 
an R. The Dm genes corresponding with most of the R-factors have been determined 
(an exception is the R18 factor). The term Dm gene as used herein comprises also 
such R-factors.  UPOV Guidelines for the Conduct of Tests for Distinctness, Homogeneity and 
Stability of Lettuce TG/13/4 (updated in 1992) and TG/13/7 (updated 26. October 
1993) refer to useful Dm-genes and to tests suitable for determining the presence of 
Dm-genes in lettuce. The useful Dm-genes listed by UPOV are Dm 2, Dm 3, Dm 4, 
Dm 5/8, Dm 6, Dm 7, Dm 10, Dm 11, Dm 16 and includes also the R 18 factor. 
UPOV states that only these should be tested on a routine basis and that special tests 
may be required for the presence of Dm 1, Dm 4, Dm 15 and Dm 10. The introduction of more than one Dm gene into the lettuce plant genome has not 
lead to lettuce types displaying a general and durable resistance to Bremia lactucae. A 
lettuce plant having one or more Dm genes which

gene confers resistance to the dutch Bremia races NL 1 to 7, NL 9 to 16, TV and 

to ITA1. 
Cultivated lettuce plants according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the non-Dm 
gene is obtained from Lactuca saligna.

Cultivated lettuce plants according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 comprising in 
their genome a non-Dm gene and one or more Dm genes. 
A method of obtaining a cultivated lettuce plants according to Claims 1 to 5 
which method comprises: 


i) performing an initial cross wherein the genetic material of one parent is 
provided by a wild type lettuce plant displaying a non-Dm gene mediated 

Bremia lactucae resistance in the cotyledon and in the true leaf, and that of 
the other parent is provided by a Lactuca sativa plant non-resistant to Bremia 

lactucae, followed by selfing to the F2 generation and selecting plants 
displaying resistance to B. lactucae strains at the cotyledon stage and the leaf 

stage (R escape plants); then 
ii) 

a) crossing said R escape plants with Lactuca sativa plants displaying 
desirable phenotype; 
b) selfing to at least the F2; 
c) selecting R escape plants therefrom; and 
d) repeating where desired steps a) to c) till lettuce plants compatible to 
lactuca sativa plants are obtained; and 
iii) 

e) crossing R escape plants selected from compatible lettuce plants with 
different Lactuca sativa plants displaying desirable phenotype; 
f) selfing to at least the F2; 
g) selecting R escape plants therefrom; and 
h) repeating where desired steps e) to g) so as to obtain Lactuca sativa 
plants; and 
iv) selfing plants obtained in iii) to at least the F4 
 
wherein at any stage in the method where a cross is made the female parent to be 

crossed is prevented from self-pollination. 
A method according to Claim 8 wherein the male parent of the initial cross is a 
Lactuca sativa plant and the female parent is a Lactuca saligna plant. 
A method according to Claim 8 or Claim 9 wherein the male parent used in 
crossing is a Lactuca sativa plant and the female parent carries the non-Dm gene 

mediated resistance to Bremia lactucae from Lactuca saligna. 
Cultivated lettuce plants obtainable according to the method of any one of claims 
6 to 8. 
Head or leaves of cultivated lettuce plants of any one of Claims 1 to 5 and 9.

Claims 1 to 5 and 9.
