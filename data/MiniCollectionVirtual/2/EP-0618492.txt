<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color photographic
material which can be rapidly processed and is high sensitive,
and more particularly to a photographic material for a color
print.It is well known that color photographs are formed by
methods comprising processing photographic materials having dye
forming couplers and silver halide emulsions on supports with
aromatic primary amine color developing agents, and reacting
oxidation products of the developing agents formed thereby with
the dye forming couplers (hereinafter referred to as couplers)
to obtain dye images.Easy rapid processing in this color development has
been very strongly required in the color photographic industry.
According to this requirement, great many improvements have
been achieved, and new, more easy rapid systems has been
developed for every several years.It is necessary for rapid processing that a reduction
in time is separately devised for each stage of color
development, bleaching-fixing, washing and drying. As a method
for rapid processing, PCT International Publication No. WO87-04534
discloses a method in which a high silver chloride color 
photographic material is rapidly processed with a color
developing solution substantially free from sulfite ions and
benzyl alcohol.High silver chloride silver halide emulsions to be used
in this method are known to be generally low in sensitivity.
For practical use, this has been a problem to be overcome.High silver chloride emulsion grains are usually liable
to become cubic crystalline grains having (100) outer planes.
However, it is possible to form grains having (111) outer
planes by existence of a grain forming controlling agent. A
method for obtaining tabular high silver chloride grains
having the (111) planes as main planes by forming grains in the
presence of a compound containing a sulfur atom in a
heterocycle is described in JP-A-63-2043 (the term "JP-A" as
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application"). Tabular grains are known to be highly
sensitizable by the use of a large amount of a sensitizing dye
because of their large surface area.However, the tabular high silver chloride emulsion
grains having the (111) outer planes are weak in absorption of
the sensitizing dye, compared with the high silver chloride
emulsion grains having the (100) outer planes, which causes the
problem that photographic characteristics considerably changes
with time after preparation of a coating solution. The tabular high silver chloride emulsion grains having
the (100)
