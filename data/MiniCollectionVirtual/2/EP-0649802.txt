<ABSTRACT>
A modular roller mat for providing rolling movement of cargo 
units over the floor of a cargo deck. The roller mat (10) comprises a 

plurality of interconnected roller tray assemblies (12). Each roller 
tray assembly comprises a tray (14) and a plurality of modular 

roller assemblies (16) including a housing and a roller unit. The 
tray includes a floor, a first side wall, a second side wall 

and a flange extending inwardly from each side wall. The 
housing includes a plate and a downwardly extending collar. The 

plate extends between the side walls of the tray and is 
removably attached to the flanges of the tray. The collar 

includes an annular sleeve through which the roller unit is 
inserted. The roller unit includes a rotatable retainer 

member. Once inserted, the roller unit retainer is rotated such 
that retaining lugs on the roller unit retainer engage the 

sleeve to retain the roller unit in the housing. The roller 
assemblies are easily removed and replaced in the tray and are 

interchangeable with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to roller conveyors used to provide 
rolling movement of cargo over the floor of a cargo deck, and 
in particular to modular roller trays and roller housings. Roller or ball mats have been used on cargo deck floors in 
aircraft to provide rolling movement of cargo carrying units 
such as cargo containers or pallets from the aircraft doorway 
to the cargo unit's final loaded position. Prior roller mats 
include an extruded frame in which a plurality of rotatable 
roller elements are mounted. However, the roller elements and 
their mounting mechanisms often become damaged during use and 
fail to operate properly. Prior roller mats require 
substantial disassembly in order to repair or replace 
individual roller units which have failed. U.S. Patent No. 3,763,980 discloses an assembly set for 
erecting roller conveyors. Each assembly set is connected to 
an adjacent assembly set by connector members disposed in the 
side walls of the assembly sets. In this fashion, a ball mat 
is constructed by interlinking a series of assembly sets. The present invention provides a modular roller mat having 
lower maintenance and lower manufacturing costs than former 
designs. The roller mat is comprised of a plurality of 
interconnected trays with each tray including a plurality of 
individual roller assembly units. The roller assembly units 
are interchangeable with one another and are easily removed and 
replaced in a tray. If a roller assembly unit fails it may be 
replaced by another unit with minimum downtime. Furthermore, 
the consistency between the modular roller assembly units 
offers cost advantages through economies of scale and a 
reduction of the inventory required to support an aircraft or 
other location where the roller mats are employed to transport  
 
cargo. The present invention is a modular roller mat for placement on 
the floor of a cargo carrying deck of an aircraft to provide 
an upper support surface over which cargo carrying units such 
as containers or pallets may be rolled. The roller mat may 
also be used on ship decks, truck beds, floors of train cars 
and buildings, and any other surface over which cargo is 
transported. The roller mat comprises a plurality of roller 
tray assemblies which are connected one to another in any 
desired arrangement. Each roller tray assembly comprises a tray having a floor 
plate, a first side wall and a second opposing side wall spaced 
apart from and extending parallel to the first side wall. The 
first and second side walls each

<CLAIMS>
A roller tray assembly for providing rolling movement of 
cargo units over a cargo deck, said roller tray assembly 

comprising: 
a tray having a first side wall and a second side wall spaced 

apart from said first side wall, 
at least one housing, said housing comprising a plate having 

an aperture said plate extending between said first and second 
side walls of said tray and being supported by said tray 

a roller unit located in said housing and projecting through 
said aperture in said plate, said roller unit including means 

for selectively engaging said housing to retain said roller 
unit in engagement with said housing, and a rotatable roller 

element projecting above said plate of said housing for 
rotatably supporting a cargo unit, said housing and roller unit 

being independently removable and replaceable in said tray as 
a unit. 
A roller tray assembly in accordance with claim 1, in which 
the roller unit comprises a casing having an aperture through 

which the roller element extends. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said 
tray includes first support means extending inwardly from said 

first side wall towards said second side wall and second 
support means extending inwardly from said second side wall 

towards said first side wall, said first and second support 
means being spaced downwardly from the tops of the side walls, 

and said plate of the housing bearing on said first and second 
support means. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 3 wherein said first 
support means comprises a first flange and said second support 

 
means comprises a second flange. 
The roller tray assembly of any of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
said means for selectively engaging said housing comprise a 

plurality of lugs. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 5 wherein said housing 
includes a plurality of grooves extending through said plate 

and forming a part of said aperture, said grooves allowing said 
lugs of said roller unit to slide through said plate when said 

lugs are in registration with said grooves. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 6 wherein each said 
roller unit is rotatable within each said housing, such that 

rotation of said roller unit rotates said lugs out of 
registration with said grooves whereby said lugs engage said 

housing and thereby retain said roller unit in engagement with 
said housing. 
The roller tray assembly of any of the preceding claims 
including a first shelf extending outwardly from said first 

side wall and a second shelf extending outwardly from said 
second side wall of said tray. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 8 wherein said first and 
second shelves are attachable to first and second shelves of 

adjacent roller tray assemblies. 
The roller tray assembly of any of the preceding claims 
including means for releasably attaching said tray to a cargo 

deck. 
The roller tray assembly of any of the preceding claims 
including a resilient member resiliently supporting said roller 

element. 
The roller tray assembly of any of the preceding claims 
 

wherein said housing includes a downwardly depending collar. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 12 wherein said collar 
includes a sleeve extending through said plate. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 13 wherein a plurality 
of grooves extend through said sleeve. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 13 wherein said collar 
includes a bottom wall spaced apart from below said sleeve. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 15 wherein said tray 
includes a floor extending between said first and second side 

walls. 
The roller tray assembly of claim 15 wherein said housing 
includes a plurality of ribs attached to said bottom wall of 

said housing, said ribs extending between said bottom wall and
