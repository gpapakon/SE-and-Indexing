<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a universal vane pump capable of drawing in with equal ease liquids of greater or lesser viscosity, or pasty, granular or fibrous substances, of the sort essentially including a stator with cylindrical bore, an eccentrical cylindrical rotor which, at its periphery, bears at least two articulated removable vanes, an inlet orifice and an outlet orifice. The pump, according to the invention, is characterised in that its rotor (2) includes recesses (14) emerging on its periphery and capable of completely housing the vanes (3) and of simultaneously containing a product to be pumped; in that the inlet (5) and outlet (6) orifices, during the intake and delivery phases, emerge in the zone freed by the said recesses and in that the leading edges of the rotor (10) and of the vanes (17, 18) and the trailing edges (11) of the inlet and outlet orifices operate in the manner of shears.

Vane pump, fit to indistinctly pumping more or 
less viscous liquids or pastes, granules or fibres such as 

meat, of the type essentially including: 

a chamber (19) delimited by a cylinder bore stator (1) 
and by two side circular flanges (7, 8), one of them (7) 

including an inlet port (5) and an outlet port (6), 
a rotor (2), cylindric, offset with respect to said 
chamber (19), including on the periphery, on one side, at 

least two paddles (3), hinged and removable , and, on the 
other side, cut-outs 14) fit to completely house said 

paddles (3) and to which lead, during said rotor (2) 
rotation, said inlet(5) and outlet (6) ports; the leading 

edges (10) of the rotor (2) and (17, 18) of the paddles 
(3) as well as the trailing edges (11) of the inlet (5) and 

outlet (6) ports, of the chamber act as a shear; 
 
characterized in that the rotor cut-outs (14) 

simultaneously contain, on its periphery, the paddles (3) 
in such a way that, between said paddles (3), in closed 

position, the side flanges (7, 8) , the leading and 
trailing edges (10, 12) and the bottom of said cut-outs 

(14), is included a well fit to contain the product to be 
pumped and to which lead, during said rotor (2) rotation, 

the inlet (5) and outlet (9) ports, of the chamber (19), 
which are completely swept by the rotor (2) solid walls. 
Pump, according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the areas of the cut-outs (14) and that of the full parts 

of the rotor (2) are identical. 
Pump, according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the rotor (2) leading edges (10) and the paddles (3) 

leading edges (17, 18) are oblique with respect to the side 
plane of the flange (7) bearing the chamber (19) inlet and 

outlet ports (5, 6). 
Pump, according to claim 1 or claim 3, 
characterized in that the leading edges (10) of the rotor 

(2) and (17, 18), of the paddles (3), have a curved shape  
 

with respect to the trailing edges (11) of the inlet (5) 
and outlet (6) ports of the chamber (19). 
Pump, according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the outlet port (6) is positioned in such a way that the 

beginning of its opening, when displacing the rotor (2) is 
coincident with the beginning of the closing of the lower 

paddle (3).
