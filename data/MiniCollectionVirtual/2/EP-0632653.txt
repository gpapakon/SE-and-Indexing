<ABSTRACT>
A digital video tape recorder records 
compressed image signals which include both intra-frame 

encoded image slices and motion compensated encoded image 
slices. The recorder receives the encoded data either in 

a format in which a portion of each frame is encoded 
using intra-frame techniques or in a format in which an 

entire frame of a group of frames is encoded using intra-frame 
techniques. Shuffling circuitry in the recorder 

recognizes the intra-frame encoded slices and reorders 
the slices as they are recorded such that a substantial 

portion of the intra-coded image slices will be recovered 
both in normal play mode and in trick play mode. For the 

one signal, these slices represent the intra-coded 
portion of each frame; for the other signal they 

represent the one intra-coded frame in the group of 
frames. In one embodiment of the invention, the trick-play 

mode is a three-times forward speed mode and the 
intra-coded slices are arranged such that substantially 

all of the intra-coded slices are recovered in trick-play 
mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video tape
recorder for recording high definition television (HDTV)
signals and in particular to a recorder which records
motion compensated compressed high definition television
signals and yet allows a high definition display to be
produced in trick-play modes, as well as to a corresponding method.Digital high definition television production
schemes have been under development for several years.
These schemes typically produce higher quality television
images and sound than conventional television systems.
To do this, these systems convey more information than is
conveyed in a conventional television signal.Recent regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), however, require that
this larger amount of information be sent within the same
band of frequencies as a conventional television signal. 
To fit the relatively large band width High Definition
Television (HDTV) signal into a standard television
channel, the information content of the HDTV signal must
be compressed.Because of the relatively large degree of
spatial redundancy and temporal redundancy in the HDTV
signals, relatively high levels of data compression can
be achieved in most television signals.One method by which spatial redundancy is
removed from a television signal is to generate a
discrete cosine transform representation of the image.
This representation resolves an image frame into
coefficient values representing its various spatial
frequency components. Portions of an image which are the
same from pixel to pixel or which exhibit a repetitive
pattern are resolved from many pixel values to a
relatively small number of frequency coefficient values.
In addition, since the human eye is less sensitive to
quantization errors in image components having high
spatial frequencies than in image components having
relatively low spatial frequencies, the high spatial
frequency coefficients may be coarsely quantized to
further reduce the amount of data used to represent the
image.Temporal redundancy in an image is removed by
encoding only the areas of a given frame which are
different from corresponding areas of a previously
encoded frame. This is generally known as predictive
coding. Temporal redundancy can be further exploited to
achieve even higher levels of data compression by
performing motion compensation. Using this scheme,
before a image block is encoded, the blocks surrounding
it in a previously encoded frame are searched for one
block which most closely matches the block in the
