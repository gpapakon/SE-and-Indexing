<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a blower for gas premix burners, in particular for burning gas in heating boilers, having a blower chamber which is provided with openings for the combustion mixture and has at least one flame-separating wall which is permeable to the combustion mixture. Arranged upstream of the blower chamber in the flow direction are a housing part (5), an impeller (8) and blower electronics (12). The impeller (8) is arranged inside the blower chamber (36) and the mixing of the combustion mixture takes place in the low-pressure operation of the impeller (8).

annular gap, is formed between an outer casing of a rotor
(7) of the driving motor (51) and the wall of the opening

that in the axial and/or circumferential direction the

gap (14) exhibits at least one narrow location (81) in
the direction of flow.

claims, characterised in that the blower wheel (8) blows

in a radial or axial direction or in a direction with
both axial and radial components.
Burner blower according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the blower wheel (8)

exhibits an upper cover (88) and a lower cover (89).
Burner blower according to one of the preceding
claims 6 to 10, characterised in that the blower wheel

(8) is coupled directly to the rotor (7) of the driving
motor (51).
Burner blower according to one of the preceding
claims 10 and 11, characterised in that the gas flows in

between the underside (58) of the housing part (5) and
the upper cover (88) of the blower wheel (8).

claims, characterised in that a gas distribution chamber

(17) is formed between the underside (58) of the housing
part (5) and the upper cover (88) of the blower wheel

(8).
Burner blower according to claim 13, characterised
in that the gas distribution chamber (17) is bounded on

the high-pressure side by a sealing labyrinth formed of
annular projections or grooves (38, 40) on the blower

wheel (8) and on the housing part (5), and in that the
sealing labyrinth is embodied in its geometric dimensions

with regard to the annular gaps (77) and the axial gaps
so that a throughput of gas is prevented when the blower

wheel (8) is rotating.
Burner blower according to one of the preceding
claims 13 and 14, characterised in that the gas

distribution chamber (17) is bounded on the low-pressure
side by a damming labyrinth formed of annular projections

or grooves (37, 39) on the blower wheel (8) and on the
housing part (5), and in that the damming labyrinth is

embodied in its geometric dimensions with regard to the
annular gaps (18) and the axial gaps so that a dynamic

head promoting the distribution of the gas over the
entire circumference (annular channel) is formed in

particular when the blower wheel (8) is rotating, but the
labyrinth gap is still large enough that the throughput

of gas required for operation of the burner can take
place.
