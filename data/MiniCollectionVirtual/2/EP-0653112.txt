<ABSTRACT>
A stator for an electric machine comprises a tubular unslotted ferromagnetic flux collector ring (16) and stator winding coils (18, 19, 20) having two legs which extend substantially axially along the inner cylindrical surface of the flux collector ring (16), wherein each winding coil leg being confined within an envelope (22) of a thin flexible non-conductive non-magnetizable material which is impregnated with and bonded to the next legs as well as to the flux collector ring (16) by a hot-setting resinous material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stator for an electric 
machine which includes a tubular unslotted ferromagnetic 
flux collector ring, and stator windings formed by a 
number of winding coils associated with the flux 
collector ring, wherein each of the winding coils has at 
least two legs which extend substantially axially along 
the inner cylindrical surface of the flux collector ring. A problem concerned with previous electric machines of 
the above type is a relatively small effective space 
available for the winding coil wires in relation to the 
total cross sectional area of the windings within the 
flux collector ring. This means a relatively low 
efficiency of the machine. One prior art method for arranging the stator windings 
inside a flux collector ring is described in EP 0 225 132 
and comprises mounting of the winding coils on a support 
structure of a non-magnetisable, non-conductive material 
and insertion of the support structure and the windings 
together into the flux collector ring. In this known 
machine, the winding support structure takes a lot of 
space and reduces the effective space available for the 
winding coil wires. Another prior art method for building electric machine 
stators, see for instance EP 0 193 929, comprises the 
measures of locating the winding legs by their end by 
using threads or tape, and then introducing them together 
with a fiberglass sleeve into the flux collector ring and 
fixing them to the latter by injecting a resin material.  
 By this known method it is very difficult to obtain an 
accurate orientation of the winding wires and hence a 
high density packing of the latter. Accordingly, the invention is intended to solve 
the problem of how to accomplish a stator for an electric 
machine with a maximum effective space available for the 
winding coil wires in relation to the total cross 
sectional area of the windings and at the same time 
obtain an accurate orientation of the winding coil wires 
inside the flux collector ring. The solution to this 
problem is accomplished by a stator design and a process according to 
the definitions stated in the following claims. A preferred embodiment of the invention is described 
below in detail with reference ot the accompanying 
drawing. On the drawing: Fig 1 shows an electric motor incorporating a stator 
according to the invention. Fig 2 shows a cross sectional view of a stator according 
to the invention. Fig 3 shows a cross sectional view of a winding coil leg 
envelope. On the drawing there is shown an

Stator for an electric machine, comprising a 
tubular slotless ferromagnetic flux collector ring (16), 

and stator windings(17) formed by a number of winding 
coils (18, 19, 20) associated with said flux collector 

ring (16), each of said winding coils (18, 19, 20) 
consisting of a number of wires put together in at least 

two legs (18a, b, 19a, b, 20a, b) extending substantially 
axially along the inner cylindrical surface of said flux 

collector ring (16),

legs (18a, b, 19a, b, 20a, b) is confined in a tube-shaped 

envelope (22) of a thin flexible non-conductive 
non-magnetizable material which is impregnated and bonded 

together with said wires in each of said winding legs 
(18a, b, 19a, b 20a, 20b) by a hot-setting resinous 

material, and said winding coil legs are fixed and 
secured to said flux collector ring (16) as well as to 

one another by bonding with said hot-setting resinous 
material.

effective space available for the winding coil wires 

consitutes more than 80 % of the total cross sectional 
area of said windings within said flux collector ring. 
Stator according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
envelope (22) has a longitudinal overlapping slot (23) 

for insertion of said winding leg, such that said 
envelope (22) encircles said winding leg by more than

said envelope material has a thickness in the range of 
0,1 - 0,5 mm. 
Process for installing the stator windings in a
