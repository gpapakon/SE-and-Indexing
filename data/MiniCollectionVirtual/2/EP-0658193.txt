<ABSTRACT>
Isolated 2-5A-dependent RNases, an interferon-induced enzyme which is activated by 5'-phosphorylated, 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) and implicated in both the molecular mechanisms of interferon action and in the fundamental control of RNA stability in mammalian cells (see Figs. 1 and 11), and encoding sequences therefor (see Figs. 3, 4, 9 and 10) are disclosed. The expression cloning and analysis of murine and human 2-5A-dependent RNases are also disclosed. Recombinant human 2-5A-dependent RNase produced in vitro and bound an activating affinity matrix, 2-5A-cellulose, have ribonuclease activity. The 2-5A binding properties of the recombinant and naturally occuring forms of 2-5A-dependent RNase are basically identical. Interferon induction of 2-5A-dependent RNase expression is demonstrated by measuring the mRNA levels in cells treated with interferon and cycloheximide. Analysis of aligned murine and human 2-5A-dependent RNase sequences revealed several features, including similarity to RNase E which is implicated in the control of mRNA stability in E. coli.

<DESCRIPTION>
ANIMAI, 2-5A- DEPENDENT RNases AND ENCODING SEQUENCES THEREFORField of the InventionThe present invention relates to isolated 2-5A-dependent RNases having the ability to bind 2-5A and/or cleave single stranded RNA when bound to 2-5A, encoding sequences therefor, recombinant nucleotide molecules, recombinant vectors and recombinant cells. BackgroundControl of RNA degradation is a critical cell function, and gene expression is often regulated at the level of RNA stability. See, e.g. , Shaw, G. and Kamen, R. , Cell. 46:659-667 (1986). Neverthe¬ less, relatively little is known about the bio¬ chemical pathways that mediate RNA degradation in mammalian systems. For instance, most if not all of the ribonucleases responsible for mRNA turnover in mammalian cells remain unidentified. This was reviewed in Brawerman, G. , Cell. 57:9-10 (1989). Presently, the 2-5A system is believed to be the only 

well-characterized RNA degradation pathway from higher animals including man. See FIG. 1. See also, e.g., Kerr, I.M. and Brown, R.E., Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 75:256-260 (1978) and Cayley, P.J. et al., Biophys Res. Commun.. 108:1243-1250 (1982); reviewed in Sen, G.C. and Lengyel, P., J. Biol. Chem.. 267:5017-5020 (1992). The activity of the 2-5A system is believed to be mediated by an endoribonuclease known as 2-5A- dependent RNase. See Clemens, M.J. and Williams, B.R.G., Cell. 13:565-572 (1978) . 2-5A-dependent RNase is a unique enzyme in that it requires 2-5A, unusual oligoadenylates with 2 ' ,5' phosphodiester linkages, pn(A2 p)nA, for ribonuclease activity. See Kerr, I.M. and Brown, R.E., Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 75:256-260 (1978) . 2-5A is produced from ATP by a family of synthetases in reactions requiring double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) . See FIG. 1. See also Hovanessian, A.G. et al., Nature. 268:537-539 (1977); Marie, I. and Hovanessian, A.G. , J. Biol. Chem.. 267:9933-9939 (1992) . 2-5A is unstable in cells and in cell-free systems due to the combined action of 2',5'-phosphodiesterase and 5'-phosphatase. See Williams, B.R.G. et al.; Eur. J. Biochem.. 92:455-562 (1978); and Johnson, M.I. and Hearl, W.G. , J. Biol. Chem.. 262:8377-8382 (1987). The interaction of 2-5A-dependent RNase and 2-5A(Kd = 4 X lO'11 M) , 

Silverman, R.H. et al., Biol. Chem.. 263:7336-7341 (1988), is highly specific. See Knight, M. et al., Nature, 288:189-192 (1980). 2-5A-dependent RNase is believed to have no detectable RNase activity until it is converted to its active state by binding to 2-5A. See Silverman, R.H. , Anal.
