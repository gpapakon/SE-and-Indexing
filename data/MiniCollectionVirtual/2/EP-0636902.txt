<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the position of a mobile vehicle within a 
limited area includes the distribution of fixed reference points along the 

perimeter of said area, the exploration of said perimeter by said vehicle by 
means of a directional electromagnetic signal, and the emission of a very 

short identification signal by said reference points in reply to the detection 
by the vehicle, said signal being decoded and processed by the vehicle 

together with the data on the direction of emission of the exploring signal. 
A device embodying said method consists in a first element, mounted on 

the vehicle, including a revolving transmitter (1) regulated and controlled 
by a clock (2) and a synchronizer (3), and a processing unit (4) which 

receives the signals from said members and from a decoder (5) which 
decodes the replies picked up by a receiver (6), as well as a plurality of 

second elements including a receiver (7) connected to a signal generator 
(8) which emits a reply by means of a transmitter (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns methods for determining the position
of mobile vehicles and in particular a method, and a relevant device, for
determining the position of mobile vehicles within a limited area.It is known that bearing devices (GPS, Loran, etc.) are used for air,
sea and land navigation which allow the determination of the vehicle
position with a maximum precision of about 10-15 metres. This precision is
amply sufficient for travels over kilometres but absolutely inadequate for
operations in small and/or crowded environments.This kind of operations in environments which are closed or however
of limited size is mainly applied in the industry and services for the
movements of items of various types and/or the inspection of environments
by means of automatic trucks or mobile robots, globally called AGV
(Automatic Guidance Vehicles). The operating areas of said AGVs may be
buildings, also on various floors, or open spaces of limited size. Most of
the problems concerning the AGVs (control, safety and obstacle
avoidance, autonomy, etc.) have already been solved but their application
in the different fields, especially outside the industry, is still limited due to
the unsatisfying methods for determining the position.A first method used in the industry is the use of magnetic tracks built
in the floor. This method assures a great precision but has two great
drawbacks. First of all it is very onerous from an economical point of view,
since it requires a serious intervention on the operation environment.
Moreover, it does not allow any operating flexibility because the paths are
fixed, so that the vehicles can not move out of the predetermined paths.A second method used in robotics is the odometric method, i.e. the
integration of the paths of the wheels or of the motion revolving members.
However, the application of said method is limited to areas with a
maximum size in the tens of metres, beyond which the odometric
calculation of the position has a greatly insufficient precision.In order to increase the precision of said method, absolute reference
points detected by means of electromagnetic (radio, laser, visual) or
magnetic signals are employed. These reference points may consist in bar
codes, light sources, magnetic tracks, etc. However, this method has the 
drawback that the detection takes place only periodically and is subjected
to environmental interferences caused, for example, by the light
conditions, the reading distance, the electromagnetic pollution, interposed
obstacles, etc. A further
