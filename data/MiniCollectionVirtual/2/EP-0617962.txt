<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-obesity agent and
more specifically to an anti-obesity agent comprising cholest-4-en-3-one
(4-cholesten-3-one) as an effective component.The obesity means such a body condition that adipose
tissue (body fat) is systemically overaccumulated and results
from an energy intake higher than the energy expenditure over a
long period of time. The obesity is accompanied by the
limitation in the physicalactivity and the application of an
excess load to various internal organs and results in various
associated diseases such as arteriosclerosis, cancers and
diabetes mellitus to thus ruin the obese person's health.Until now, there have been proposed a variety of
medicinal-therapeutic methods for preventing obesity, but these
methods must solve various difficulties in order to ensure a
satisfactory effect. For instance, the drug therapy using
hormones or excitometabolics suffers from a problem that the
decomposition of body proteins are promoted simultaneously with
the decomposition of body fats. Among the hormone, a certain
androgenic hormone has been known to show anti-obesity effects 
through the stimulation of the myotropic action and hence the
promotion of the consumption of reserve fats. Examples of such
androgenic hormones include dehydroepiandrosterone and 3-keto-Δ
↑ 9-19-norsteroid (Japanese Un-examined Patent Publication No.
Hei 02-275895). In addition, anorectics and digestive enzyme-inhibitors
suffer from a problem of side-effects such as nervous
sympton and diarrhea.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide an anti-obesity agent free of the foregoing
disadvantages.The inventor of this invention has found out that 4-cholesten-3-one
has a fat accummulation-inhibitory effect and
that obesity can be prevented and treated through the
administration of this compound, and thus have completed the
present invention.According to an aspect of the present invention, there is
provided an anti-obesity agent which comprises 4-cholesten-3-one
as an effective component and which is effective for the 
prevention and treatment of obesity.According to another aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a medicinal composition which comprises 4-cholesten-3-one
as an effective component and a pharmaceutically
acceptable excipient and which is effective for the prevention
and treatment of obesity.A still further object of the present invention is the use
of 4-cholesten-3-one in the preparation of a medicinal
composition for preventing or treating obesity.The
