<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionCHEMICAL PREVENTION OR REVERSAITOF CATARACT BY PHASE SEPARATION INHIBITORSGovernment SupportThe United States Government may have certain rights in this invention pursuant to National Institute of Health Grant Nos. NIH-5-R01- EY05127 and NIH-5-R01-EY05496.Technical FieldThe present invention relates generally to compositions for the prevention or inhibition of cataracts, and more specifically, to compositions containing coenzyme A or derivatives or metabolites thereof.Background of the Invention"Cataract" is the general term for any pathological condition in which the normal transparency of the ocular lens is substantially diminished. More than one million cataract extractions are performed annually in the United States, and it is estimated that 5 to 10 million individuals become visually disabled each year due to cataracts.Although often regarded as an inevitable accompaniment of advancing age, cataracts may develop at any time in life, even before birth. Risk factors for cataract formation include metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes), exposure to toxic agents in the environment (e.g., ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation), drug side effects, and inherited traits. Clinical experience suggests that the natural course of different types of cataracts are distinct. However, objective, quantitative data is generally lacking.Development of anti-cataract agents has been hampered, in part, by the lack of a good animal model of human cataract. Consequently, putative anti-cataract agents may be evaluated for efficacy in a variety of different models which, to the extent that they are understood at all, are thought to occur by different mechanisms. For example, radiation-induced cataract is generally believed to result from oxidative damage to the lens. Diabetic cataract is thought to be due to the accumulation of polyols (such as sorbitol) in the lens, resulting from increased activity of the enzyme aldose reductase. Selenite- induced cataract is thought to be due to activation of a class of Ca^+ -dependent 

proteases in the lens. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) hereditary cataract is thought to be due to the action of products released by the retina. Because cataract in the various animal models is thought to occur by different biochemical mechanisms, it is generally believed that no single anti-cataract agent can be effective in all models.In contrast to the understanding of cataract pathogenesis, the cellular structure of the lens is fairly well characterized. The lens exhibits a high

Claims
1. A composition for preventing or inhibiting the formation of cataract comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of coenzyme A or a derivative thereof in combination with an acceptable carrier or diluent.
2. The composition of claim 1 wherein the derivative of coenzyme A is selected from the group consisting of acetyl coenzyme A, malonlyl coenzyme A, methylmalonyl coenzyme A, succinyl coenzyme A, propionyl coenzyme A, coenzyme A glutathione disulfide and oxidized coenzyme A.
3. A composition for preventing or inhibiting the formation of cataract comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a metabolite of coenzyme A in combination with an acceptable carrier or diluent.
4. The composition of claim 3 wherein the metabolite of coenzyme A is selected from the group consisting of 4'-phosphopantothenic acid, 4'- phosphopantothenoyl-L-cysteine, 4'-phosphopantetheine, alethine, des-pantothenic acid, cysteamine and cystamine.
5. The composition of claim 3 wherein the metabolite of coenzyme A is dephospho-coenzyme A.
6. The composition of claim 3 wherein the metabolite of coenzyme A is a smaller compound formed by the breakage of one or more covalent linkages of coenzyme A.
7. A method for preventing or inhibiting the formation of cataract in the lens of a living warm-blooded animal, comprising administering to the animal a composition according to claims 1-7.
