<ABSTRACT>
The container has a first container part (26), having the length (L1) and an opening, furthermore a second container part (8) having the length (L3), which parts are connected to one another by means of a foldable wall part (6) having the length (L2). The diameter (D1) of the first container part (2) is smaller than the diameter (D2) of the second container part (8). Adjoining the second container part (8) at the bottom is a second foldable wall part (10) on which a third container part (12) is arranged, which contains a bottom (14) and which has, at the upper end, a larger or smaller diameter (D3) than the second container part (8). The lengths (L4, L5) of the second wall part (10) and of the third container part (12) are such that the second container part (8) can be fitted in or over the third container part (12), with the second wall part (10) being folded in. This results in a container which is particularly sturdy and facilitates writing (printing, labelling) and handling.

A compressible container, in particular a bottle, 
where a collapsible wall member (6, 6a) is disposed 

between a first container part (2, 2a) comprising an 
opening and a second container part (8, 8a), where the 

second container part (8, 8a) has a larger diameter (D
2
, 
Da
2
) than the first container part (2, 2a) and the 
container parts and the wall member possess lengths (L
1
, 
L
2
, L
3
, La
1
, La
2
, La
3
) such that in the compressed state 
the first container part (2, 2a) can be disposed in the 

second container part (8, 8a) by the collapsing of the 
wall member (6, 6a), characterised in that the second 

wall part (8, 8a) is downwardly adjoined by a second 
collapsible wall member (10, 10a) adjoining which a 

third container part (12, 12a) is disposed, which third 
container part (12, 12a) comprises a base (14) and at 

its upper end possesses a larger or smaller diameter (D
3
, 
Da
3
) than the second container part (8, 8a), where the 
lengths (L
4
, L
5
, La
4
, La
5
) of the second wall member (10, 
10a) and of the third container part (12, 12a) are such 

that the second container part (8, 8a) is invertible 
into or over the third container part (12, 12a) by the 

collapsing of the second wall member (10, 10a). 
A container according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the lengths (L
1
, L
3
, L
5
, La
1
, La
3
, La
5
) of the 
container parts (2, 8, 12, 2a, 8a, 12a) are 

substantially equal to one another and are equal to or 
smaller than the lengths (L
2
, L
4
, La
2
, La
4
) of the 
collapsible wall members (6, 10, 6a, 10a). 
A container according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that at least one collapsible wall 

member possesses a smaller wall thickness than the 
adjoining container parts.  

 
A container according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the collapsible wall member 

continues via a convex edge zone into the first 
container part and via a concave edge zone into the 

second container part. 
A container according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that at least one collapsible 

wall member (6, 6a, 10, 10a) is of bellows-like 
formation. 
A container according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that at least the inner connection (26) between the 

folds (22, 24) of a pair of folds has a rounded cross-section. 
A container according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that in each case one fold (22, 30) of 

a pair of folds forms a smaller angle (α) with the 
vertical plane (28) than the angle (β) of the other fold 

(24, 32). 
A container according to at least one of Claims 5 
to 7, characterised in that in each case one fold (22, 

30) of a pair of folds possesses a longer length (L
6
, L
8
) 
than the other fold (24, 32).
