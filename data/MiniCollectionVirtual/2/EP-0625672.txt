<ABSTRACT>
The fluid management system comprises a mixing/recirculation 
system including an external recirculation pump (14) for receiving 

fluid from a zero gravity storage system (12) and returning an output 
flow of the fluid to the storage system. An internal axial spray 

injection system (30) is provided for receiving a portion of the 
output flow from the recirculation pump. The spray injection 

system thermally de-stratifies liquid and gaseous cryogenic fluid 
stored in the storage system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cryogenic storage systems 
and more particularly to a cryogenic fluid management system for 
zero gravity applications.  
 Long term storage of sub-critical cryogens in space must 
address the problem of thermal stratification in storage tanks, 
and associated feed systems. Due to the absence of gravity 
induced body forces, thermal stratification in zero gravity can 
be much more severe than commonly experienced in a one G 
environment. If left uncontrolled, the thermal gradients in zero 
gravity will result in excessive tank pressure rise and formation 
of undesirable liquid and vapor mixtures within the liquid bulk, 
liquid acquisition system, and liquid transfer lines. Under zero gravity conditions, gases in any storage tank for 
liquids may occur in any physical location within the interior of 
the tank, for example, either at the top of the tank, the bottom 
of the tank, or any intermediate section thereof. A vehicle adapted to be subjected to the zero gravity 
operating environment of outer space may include a storage tank 
for liquids wherein solar heat input will increase the pressure 
of the tank and gases must be vented from the tank to prevent 
overpressurization and rupture. A special problem is thus 
presented in that it is necessary to vent only the gas from the 
system without loss of all liquid stored in the tank. State of the art thermodynamic venting system concepts have 
only addressed issues associated with the tank. Typically, only  
 
the liquid bulk has been considered. Ullage, feedline, or zero 
gravity liquid acquisition devices (screens, capillary channels), 
have not been included in the total thermal destratification 
system design. Also, the performance of previous thermodynamic 
venting concepts has relied on complex analyses to characterize 
the zero gravity fluid mixing and heat transfer phenomenon. U.S. Patent No. 3,105,361, entitled "Zero Gravity Vent 
System", issued to L. R. Bell, discloses the utilization of a 
centrifuge to separate the liquid and vapor phases of the fluid 
withdrawn from a cryogenic storage tank which is subsequently 
used to generate power to compress the withdrawn two-phase fluid 
and also to chill the liquid fluid phase across a heat exchanger 
prior to returning it to the cryogenic storage tank. Pressure 
reduction in the cryogenic liquid tank in this concept always 
results in overboard fluid venting losses. The venting loss 
increases if the fluid straight from cryogenic liquid tank is 
primarily of liquid

storage system, comprising: 


a mixing/recirculation system, comprising: 

a) an external recirculation pump (14) for receiving fluid 
from a zero gravity storage system (12) and returning an output flow 

of said fluid to said storage system;
 
   characterized by : 
b) an internal axial spray injection system (30) for 
receiving a portion of said output flow from said recirculation 

pump (14), said spray injection system for thermally de-stratifying 
liquid and gaseous cryogenic fluid stored in said storage system; and 
a heat rejection system, comprising: 

a) an external vent valve (40) for receiving a second 
portion of said output flow from said recirculation pump (14); 
b) an external expansion orifice (42) for receiving an 
output flow from said vent valve; 
c) an internal heat exchanger (44) for receiving an output 
flow from said expansion orifice for absorbing heat from said 

portion of the output flow from said recirculation pump (14) which was 
directed through said spray injection system (30), said heat exchanger (44) 

having an output flow; and, 
d) a back pressure orifice (46) for establishing a desired 

heat exchanger pressure level. 
The fluid management system of Claim 1, wherein said 
mixing/recirculation system comprises a controller (38) for initiating 

and terminating recirculation pump operation at a desired storage 
system fluid pressure range without activating said heat 

rejection system, thereby accomplishing pressure control without 
storage system fluid venting losses.  

 
The fluid management system of Claim 2, wherein said 
controller (38) includes means for initiating and terminating said 

control valve operation in a desired storage system fluid 
temperature range so as to control fluid bulk temperature by heat 

rejection through overboard venting.

a fill line (54) for receiving cryogenic filling fluid from an 
external cryogenic re-supply source and providing said filling 

fluid to said recirculation pump (14) ; and, 
a chill/fill valve (22) so positioned to operate in a closed 
position to prevent said cryogenic filling fluid from being 

introduced directly to said zero gravity storage system and 
preventing the bypassing of said spray injection system so as to 

thermally chill said zero gravity storage system, 
said chill/fill valve (22) being operable in a normally open 
position to allow simultaneous introduction of said filling fluid 

to said recirculation pump (14) and direct filling of said storage 
system, thereby accomplishing no vent fill with continuous ullage 

gas condensation through use of said spray injection system (30).
