A photosensitive material for electrophotography having 
an electrically conducting substrate and a photosensitive 

layer containing a charge-generating agent and a charge-transporting 
agent which comprises (i) a P-type charge-generating 

pigment and (ii) either an N-type charge-generating 
pigment or an N-type inorganic semiconductor or 

photoconductor, wherein at least part of the charge-generating 
agent is dispersed in the form of aggregates in 

the photosensitive layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive 
material for electrophotography and, more specifically, 
to a sensitized photosensitive material for 
electrophotography. Widely used photosensitive materials for 
electrophotography can be represented by those of the 
function separated-type that are obtained by providing 
on an electrically conducting substrate a photosensitive 
layer which contains a charge-generating agent and a 
charge-transporting agent. The photosensitive materials 
of this type can roughly be divided into those of the 
type of a so-called single dispersion layer obtained by 
dispersing a charge-generating agent in a medium that 
contains a charge-transporting agent and those of the 
type of a so-called laminated layer obtained by 
providing, on the electrically conducting substrate, the 
charge-generating agent and the charge-transporting 
layer in the order mentioned or in a reverse order. As the charge-generating agent, there are used, in 
many cases, P-type charge-generating pigments such as 
phthalocyanine pigment and like pigment as well as 
N-type charge-generating pigments such as perylene 
pigment, azo pigment and like pigment. Generally, 
however, these pigments have poor balance in the 
spectral sensitivity. When use is made only of the 
N-type charge-generating pigment such as perylene 
pigment or azo pigment, in particular, sensitivity is 
low on the side of long wavelengths of from 600 to 700 
nm and fogging occurs on a yellow-base paper. In 
designing a photosensitive material that can be used in  
 
common for the halogen source of light, fluorescent 
source of light and laser source of light, it is desired 
that the photosensitive material has panchromatic 
spectral sensitivity. There is, however, available no 
pigment that meets the above requirement, and technology 
has been proposed for using plural kinds of pigments as 
described below. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
222961/1990 filed by the present applicant discloses a 
photosensitive material of the laminated layer type in 
which a charge-transporting layer and a 
charge-generating layer are provided on an electrically 
conducting substrate in the order mentioned, by using, 
as charge-generating agents, an N-type pigment 
(dibromoanthanthrone) and a P-type pigment (metal-free 
phthalocyanine) at a ratio of from 40/60 to 90/10. Moreover, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
228670/1990 discloses the use of an X-type metal-free 
phthalocyanine in an amount of from 1.25 to 3.75 parts 
by
