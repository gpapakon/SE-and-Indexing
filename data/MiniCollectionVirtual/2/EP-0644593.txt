absorbing thermal deformation, is excellent in radiating 
ability and enables an easy maintenance operation. To this 

end, in the semiconductor module of the invention thermal

area of contact with a semiconductor device (3) or an inner 
surface of a housing (5, 7) and has opposed heat transfer 

surfaces. A radiator (7, 30) is formed integrally on the 
housing. With this structure, large thermal deformation 

resulting from a high heat production density design can be

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a semiconductor 
module for use in an electronic device with a 
high heat generation density, and more particularly to a 
semiconductor module suited for use in such an electronic 
device as a large-size general-purpose computer 
and a super computer. A module of the type in which flexible thermal 
conductors are provided between respective semiconductor 
devices and a housing, and heat generated from each 
semiconductor device is transferred to the housing 
through the associated thermal conductor to thereby 
effect cooling is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 
No. 5,005,638. In this conventional arrangement, cylindrical 
holes are formed in the housing at positions 
corresponding to respective chips therein, and a piston-like 
thermal conductor is fitted in each of the 
cylindrical holes. One end of each thermal conductor is 
urged by a spring into contact with the corresponding or 
associated semiconductor chip, so that heat from the 
chips is transferred to the housing. A water jacket for 
flowing cooling water is mounted on the housing, and the 
housing and the water jacket are separate in structure 
from each other. In another conventional arrangement as  
 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 
60-126853, planar or flat fins are interleaved with one 
another to form a thermal conductor. In this case, 
also, each thermal conductor is urged by a spring into 
contact with the surface of an associated semiconductor 
chip, but a housing itself has no radiation means, and a 
separate water jacket or the like is mounted on the 
housing. Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 61-231744 
discloses an arrangement in which each thermal 
conductor is urged by a spring into contact with both of 
an associated semiconductor chip surface and an inner 
surface of a housing. In this conventional arrangement, 
also, the housing itself is provided with no radiation 
means, and a separate water jacket or the like is 
mounted on the housing. Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 61-32819 
discloses an arrangement in which thermal 
conductors, each having interleaved planar fins, are 
fixedly secured both to respective semiconductor chips 
and to the inner surface of a housing. In this conventional 
arrangement, also, the housing itself is not 
provided with radiating means, and a separate water 
jacket is mounted on the housing. U.S. Patent No. 4,800,956 discloses an 
arrangement in which thermal conductors, each having 
interleaved planar fins, are
