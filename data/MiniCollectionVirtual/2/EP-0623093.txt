<ABSTRACT>
An attachment for a fork lift truck is disclosed for picking up slab-shaped components (35). The slab-shaped components (35) are picked up by a pick-up device on the attachment, secured by a supporting arm (10) and a guide rod (12) to a frame. The frame can be held by the fork (1) of the fork lift. By swivelling the supporting arm (10) through 90 DEG , the pick-up device rotates trough 180 DEG , guided by the guide rod (12). The supporting arm is swivelled by a hydraulic lifting cylinder.

<CLAIMS>
A supplementary unit for a travelling fork lift truck, 
comprising a frame which is adapted to be connected to the 

forks (1) of the fork lift truck, and a pick-up means provided 
with gripping elements (34) for holding platelike 

mounting elements (35), 
characterized in that
 said pick-up 
means is arranged on a carrier arm (10) which is supported 

on said frame such that it is pivotable about a horizontal 
shaft (11) so as to pick up the platelike mounting elements 

(35) from a pick-up position and so as to set them down in 
an overhead mounting position, that the pick-up means is 

provided with two spaced bearing locations (15 and 16) with 
pivot bearings permitting vertical pivoting, the first bearing 

location (15) being articulated on the carrier arm (10) 
which is adapted to be pivoted on the frame about a first 

horizontal shaft (11) and the second bearing location (16) 
being connected to a guide rod (12) which is articulated on 

the frame such that it is adapted to be pivoted about a second 
horizontal shaft (13) extending in spaced relationship 

with said first horizontal shaft (11), and that an actuator 
(8) used for pivoting the carrier arm (10) about the first 

horizontal shaft (11) is arranged between the carrier arm 
(10) and the frame, the two bearing locations (15 and 16) 

and the two horizontal shafts (11 and 13) being arranged 
relative to one another in such a way that, when the pick-up 

means is turned round by 180° from the pick-up position into 
an overhead mounting position, the carrier arm (10) can be 

pivoted about the first horizontal shaft (11) on the frame 
through an angle of less than 180°, preferably 90°, and that 

the first and second bearing locations (15 and 16) are arranged 
on a rotatable pick-up device (19), and that said 

rotatable pick-up device (19) has a vertical shaft (23) and  
 

a horizontal rotational shaft (26), which is pivotably 
supported on said vertical shaft (23), and that the pick-up 

means is rotatably supported on the horizontal rotational 
shaft (26). 
A supplementary unit according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the carrier arm (10) and the guide rod (12) intersect 
when they are in the pick-up position. 
A supplementary unit according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in that
, in the pick-up position, the first and 
second bearing locations (15 and 16) are arranged horizontally 

with respect to each other. 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
3, 
characterized in that
 the gripping elements (34) are constructed 
as suckers, which are provided with an air discharge 

means whose connection (27) is arranged at the free 
end of the horizontal rotational shaft (26). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 

4, 
characterized in that
 the horizontal rotational shaft 
(26) and the vertical shaft (23) are constructed as tubular 

sections, the horizontal rotational shaft (26) being connected 
to the circumferential surface of the vertical shaft 

(23) and cavities of said tubular sections being interconnected 
by a hole provided in the circumferential surface or 

said vertical shaft (23). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
5, 
characterized in that
 the two ends of the vertical shaft 
(23) are adapted to be provided with air connection means 

(24). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
6, 
characterized in that
 the air connection means (24, 27) 
are constructed as axially supported connection adapters  

 
arranged in the hole of a respective tubular section of the 

vertical shaft (23) and/or of the horizontal rotational 
shaft (26), said connection adapters being rotatably supported 

in the respective hole of the tubular sections and 
being adapted to be connected to air hoses or conduits (43). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
7, 
characterized in that
 the pick-up means is provided with 
a deflection lever (32) which is arranged in such a way that 

the movement about the horizontal rotational shaft (26) can 
be blocked by actuating said deflection lever (32). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
8, 
characterized in that
 the pick-up means is provided with 
a catch lever (31), and that movements about the horizontal 

rotational shaft (26) and the vertical shaft (23) of said 
pick-up means can be blocked by actuating said catch lever 

(31). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
9, 
characterized in that
 the frame has a vertical support 
(4) which carries the first and second horizontal shafts (11 

and 13), and a horizontal support (3) which is adapted to be 
connected to the forks (1) of the fork lift truck and which 

projects on the same side of the vertical support (4) as the 
carrier arm (10). 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
10, 
characterized in that
 at least one reinforcement rib (5) 
is arranged on the vertical support (4) of the frame on the 

side facing away from the horizontal support (3), said reinforcement 
rib (5) being provided with a hole (6) by means of 

which the frame can be connected to the fork lift truck. 
A supplementary unit according to one of the claims 1 to 
11, 
characterized in that
 there is provided a drive means, 
e.g. an electric motor or a hydraulic drive, for effecting  

 
the pivoting movement about the vertical shaft (23) and/or 

the horizontal rotational shaft (26).
