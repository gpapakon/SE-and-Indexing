A device for butt joining cable trunking portions (C and C') 
of the type comprising a joining plate (10) carrying in facing 

relationship to at least one line of perforations of said portions an 
aligned array of projecting loops (21, 21') adapted to engage into at 

least two perforations of each portion and a toothed comb member (30) 
for locking the joining plate by engagement of teeth (33, 33') into the 

loops which are thus engaged, characterised by the existence within the 
joining plate of means for regulating the position of the loops. 
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
regulating means comprise: 


a joining plate (10) having on respective sides of a central 
zone (13) a continuous slot (15) extending in facing relationship to a 

line of perforations, and 
at least one latch (20) associated with each of the slots with 
at least two projecting loops (21) and capable of sliding in said slot. 
A device according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
continuous slot (15) constitutes an elongate window at the bottom of a 

recess (16) provided in the thickness of the upright portion (12) of a 
joining plate. 
A device according to claim 3 characterised in that a front 
plate portion (22) of each latch is adapted to engage into and slide in 

the recess (10) of a corresponding window (15). 
A device according to claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in that 
retaining and guide teeth (171-173, 181-184) are provided along the 

lower and upper edges (17, 18) of the recess. 
A device according to claim 5 characterised in that there is 
further provided a flexible catch (170, 180) in a central part of each 

of the recess edges (17, 18).  
 
A device according to claim 1 characterised by the existence 
of means for locking the regulation of the position of the loops. 
A device according to claim 7 characterised in that the 
locking means are adapted to be actuated by the locking toothed comb 

member. 
A device according to claim 8 characterised in that the 
locking means comprise complementary tooth arrangements (19, 29) 

provided at the bottom of the recess and on the internal face of the 
plate portion of the latch. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the toothed comb member comprises a cap. 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 10 characterised 

in that the toothed comb member associated with each latch comprises a 
number of teeth corresponding to the number of loops of said latch. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised by a means for locking the toothed comb member which is 

adapted to come into operation when the teeth of the toothed comb member 
are engaged into the loops. 
A device according to claim 12 characterised in that the means 
for locking the toothed comb member comprises a latching catch (36) 

intended to co-operate with the perforation. 
A device according to claim 13 characterised by a wedge-shaped 
recess (37) in the dorsal wall of the toothed comb member. 
A device according to claim 9 characterised in that the plate 
portion of the latch is also provided with guide tongues (25) opposite 

each loop.  
 
A device according to claim 5 and claim 4 characterised in 
that grooves (22a, 22b) are provided along the upper and lower edges of 

the plate portion of the latch. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the joining plate is of a right-angled profile. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 16 characterised 
in that the joining plate is of a generally flat profile. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised by the provision in the central zone of the joining plate 

of a pivoting means (103). 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 19 characterised 
by a latch provided with aligned loops in opposite relationship to a 

plurality of lines of perforations of the cable trunking.
