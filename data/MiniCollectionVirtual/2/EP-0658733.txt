<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal insulation panel, in particular for refrigeration and/or freezer appliances, having supporting means (6) arranged between parallel wall surfaces (3, 4) and a tightly attached terminating element (5) in the edge region between the wall surfaces (3, 4), the hollow space receiving the supporting means (6) is evacuated to a great extent. In order to achieve a thermally insulating transition, one wall surface (4) has at least one edge (7) which is set back relative to the adjacent edge (8) of the other wall surface (3), the terminating element (5) being guided directly from the set-back edge (7) in at least two steps or in a straight line at an inclination into the region of the adjacent projecting edge (8) of the other wall surface (3).

Refrigerator and/or freezer with a heat insulating
panel, more particularly for the door wall, cover wall,

side wall or base wall, which comprises support means
arranged between parallel wall surfaces and a sealing

element which is fitted in a vacuum-tight manner in the
peripheral region between the wall surfaces, and the

cavity accommodating the support means is extensively
evacuated, a wall surface (4) facing the region which is

to be refrigerated comprising at least one edge (7) set
back relative to the adjacent edge (8) of the other wall

surface (3) facing the external region in order to
produce a heat conduction path extension between the

inner and outer wall surfaces and thus increase heat
transmission resistance, to which end the sealing element

(5) is guided directly from the set-back edge (7) in at
least two steps (5.1, 14, 18) or linearly at an

inclination into the region of the adjacent projecting
edge (8) of the other wall surface (3).
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 1,
characterised in that the edge (8) projecting bevond the

set-back edge (7) projects with this edge (8) beyond the
connecting region (9) of the sealing element (5).
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 1 or
2, characterised in that, in the region of edges (7, 8)

offset relative to one another, the sealing element (5)
is constructed in the manner of a bevelled edge.
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 3,
characterised in that sealing elements (5) of heat

insulating panels fitted at angles to one another are
arranged flush and closely adjacent one another. 
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 1 or
one of the following, characterised in that a sealing

element (5) is constructed as in stepped fashion and the
edge region of a wall element (2) standing at right

angles to the wall surfaces (3, 4) of a heat insulating
panel (1) engages in the step (14) adjacent the set-back

edge (7) of said heat insulating panel.
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 1 or
one of the following, characterised in that the sealing

element (5) is covered by means of a cover strip (12,
12.1) made of heat-insulating material and having a

matching profile.
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 1 or
one of the following, characterised in that the set-back

edge (7), at least over part of its length, comprises one
or more angled brackets (13), to which a cover strip (12)

covering the sealing element (5) or other fittings is/are
secured.
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 5 or
one of the following, characterised in that the cover

strip (12) is arranged between the sealing element (5)
and the front edge region (16) of the wall element (2).
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 8,
characterised in that a seal (20) is arranged between an

end face (16) of the wall element and the cover strip
(12).
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 5 or
one of the following, characterised in that, on its end

face (16) facing the adjacent sealing element (5), the
wall element (2) supports a cover strip (12.1) made of 

heat-insulating material, which engages over a sealing
element (5.2) of the wall element.
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 2 or
one of the following, characterised in that a swivel

bearing element (10) and/or control, regulating and/or
display elements is/are secured to the free edge section

(8) projecting beyond the connecting region (9).
Refrigerator and/or freezer according to claim 1 or
one of the following, characterised in that the sealing

element (5) is constructed as a diaphragm having a low
degree of thermal conductivity.
