<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 1,2-dithiole-3-thione 
derivatives; processes for production 
thereof; and therapeutic or preventive agents for 
diseases associated with peroxylipid, each containing 
said derivative as the active ingredient. It has recently been made clear that peroxylipid 
has close connection with various diseases. 
These diseases include, for example, arteriosclerosis, 
lung diseases, digestive diseases, hepatic diseases, 
heart diseases, cerebrovascular disturbance, inflammation, 
autoimmune diseases, shock, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, dermal diseases, ocular diseases, 
diabetes, cancer, renal diseases, iron hypersensitivity, 
pancreatitis, and toxicities of antibiotics and 
anticancer drugs. The manifestation and aggravation of 
said diseases is thought to be associated with the 
lipid peroxidation by active oxygens or free radicals. With respect to heart diseases, ischemic 
heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and the  
 
like are on the rapid rise in recent years. For the 
therapy thereof, reperfusion therapy has come to be 
used widely, and favorable results have been obtained. 
Meanwhile, it is reported that even when the reperfusion 
therapy enables the restart of blood flow, the 
therapy invites new injuries, i.e. reperfusion injuries 
such as malignant arrhythmia (e.g. ventricular fibrillation), 
hemorrhagic infarction, no-reflow phenomenon 
and the like. These reperfusion injuries are thought 
to be associated with active oxygens and peroxylipid. 
It is also thought that the reperfusion injuries arise 
in heart operation or organ transplant, and attention 
is being paid to the injuries. Therapeutic agents for ischemic heart diseases, 
having a 1,2-dithiole-3-thione skeleton are described 
in Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) 
No. 301868/1993. The agents have had a problem 
in water solubility when used as an injection. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a novel drug which is capable of inhibiting the 
formation of peroxylipid and accordingly is useful for 
the therapy or prevention of diseases associated with 
peroxylipid and which is further highly water-soluble 
and accordingly can be administered intravenously when 
said diseases need urgent treatments.  The present inventors made an extensive study 
with an aim of developing a drug effective for the 
therapy or prevention of the above-mentioned diseases 
and, as a result, found out that the novel compounds or 
their salts of the present invention have an excellent
