<ABSTRACT>
The present specification discloses an 
electrophoresis plate (10) and a method of making an 

electrophoresis gel plate package wherein said plate 
includes a substrate (16) and an electrophoresis 

medium layer (18) on the substrate, the 
electrophoresis medium layer including liquid in a 

microporous gel such as agarose. The electrophoresis 
plate is packaged with a protective plastic film (15) 

across the electrophoresis medium layer. Methyl 
cellulose is included in the electrophoresis medium 

layer so that expressed liquid will form a uniform 
layer on the electrophoresis medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophoresis plate and
a method of making an electrophoresis plate package. More particularly
the present invention relates to an electrophoresis plate which is sealed
in a container or package.Valuable diagnostic information can be obtained by an
analysis of certain biological fluids from a patient.
Electrophoresis is known to be an effective technique for
separating the various components of such fluids for
subsequent analyses using optical densitometry techniques.
The physical phenomenon underlying electrophoretic analysis
is that particles which have an effective electric charge
and which are deposited on a solid or semi-solid medium are
caused to move with respect to the medium by an electric
field applied across the medium. Particles of different
types move at different rates, so a mixture of different
types of particles is separated into its different components
or fractions by electrophoretic analyses. These
separated fractions may then be stained (visualized) by
exposing the fractions to a suitable reagent so that the
fractions can be optically detected using visible or
ultraviolet light.The electrophoresis process has been performed through
a series of manual steps for many years. The electrophoresis
medium is typically a gel substance such as
agarose that has been fixed onto a suitable substrate
(e.g., Mylar) to form an electrophoresis plate. The liquid
sample to be examined is typically blood serum, but of
course may be other liquids.The electrophoresis process requires careful attention
in order to provide accurate and reproducible results. It
is therefore not surprising that techniques for performing
electrophoresis automatically have been developed.US 4709810 discloses a container for protecting and enclosing on
electrophoretic support medium. The container includes a top portion and a bottom
portion, which when closed sealingly engage one another. EP-A-0246873 discloses an element for electrophoresis which comprises a
plastic film, a layer for electrophoresis comprising an aqueous polyacrylamide gel,
an adhesive layer containing gelatin and optionally a film-forming polymer and/or
fine particles and a plastic film.Electrophoresis plates for use with automatic equipment are typically
distributed with plastic films over the working portion of the electrophoresis medium
layer. The 
film protects the electrophoresis surface from contaminants
and also prevents evaporation of water and thus helps to
maintain the integrity of the electrophoresis medium
