<ABSTRACT>
The ostomy pouch 10 has a coupling member 32 that can be removed 
from the pouch envelope to permit flush disposal of the envelope 

without the coupling member. Flushability of the pouch is 
further enhanced by forming the pouch with converging side walls 

20, 22. Thus, when the pouch 10 is deposited in a toilet bottom 
end first in a carrier sleeve, the pouch can flow in streamlined 

fashion through the passages of a toilet and any sewer pipe or 
septic line connected to the toilet. Depending upon the flush 

capacity of the toilet and the flow rate of water through the 
toilet and sewer line, the ostomy pouch can be deposited in the 

toilet without a carrier sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to ostomy pouches and
more particularly to a novel flushable ostomy pouch.One of the problems associated with ostomy care is
the disposal of the ostomy collection pouch after it has been
used. If the used pouch is disposed of by flushing down a
toilet, there is a risk that the pouch may become trapped in
a toilet passage or sewer line, thereby causing plumbing
problems. Thus some users empty the contents of the pouch
into the toilet and then discard the pouch in the garbage.Other users dispose of the used pouch and its
contents in the garbage, which usually necessitates
prewrapping of the pouch with paper and/or placement of the
used pouch in a plastic bag prior to disposal. Regardless of
which measures are taken to dispose of a used ostomy pouch,
the process is generally unduly laborious and oftentimes
discomforting.Thus there has been an ongoing effort to develop an
ostomy pouch that provides relatively trouble-free
flushability down a toilet.A major problem in flushing an ostomy pouch down a
toilet is that the coupling or securing structure around the
waste inlet opening of the ostomy pouch, such as shown in
U.S. Patent 4,372,308, can cause the pouch to become trapped 
in the flow passages of the toilet or in a connecting pipe or
sewer line.Efforts have thus been made to form ostomy pouches
of materials that soften and become slimy or slippery when
contacted with water to promote flowage in pipelines and flow
passages.While pouches that become slimy or slippery upon
contact with water help minimize clogging and trapping
problems associated with flush disposal of ostomy pouches,
they can be discomforting if they become wet while being
worn. Such pouches might discourage a user from engaging in
swimming and other physical activity and would require
protective covering while showering. Furthermore, such
pouches may still cause clogging in toilets with relatively
low volume flush capacity.Another structure that facilitates flush disposal of
ostomy pouches is that of U.S. Patent 4,830,187, which shows
a carrier sleeve or bag into which a pouch can be placed
before flush disposal. The sleeve or bag forms a slimy or
slippery layer when exposed to water, thereby sliding on
surfaces that might otherwise cause snagging of the pouch.
However, since the carrier sleeve conforms to the pouch
during flushing, a pouch with a coupling that is not flexible
enough to negotiate the flow passages in toilet may still
become trapped even with a slippery carrier sleeve. Reference is also made to

<CLAIMS>
A flushable ostomy pouch (10) for holding body waste that passes through a
stoma comprising,


a) a envelope (12,14) formed of flexible plastic sheet material defining
a waste collection chamber for body waste that passes through a stoma,
b) a waste inlet opening (30) formed in said envelope for passage of
waste material from said stoma into said collection chamber,
c) flexible pouch-side coupling means (32) on said envelope around said
waste inlet opening for co-operating with a body-side coupling means for attaching said

waste inlet opening around a stoma,
d) bonding means (38) for detachably bonding said coupling means (32)
to said envelope, characterised in that said pouch-side coupling means (32) is removable

from said envelope to facilitate flush disposal of said envelope in a toilet without coupling
means (32) attached thereto, said bonding means (38) having a predetermined bond strength

that permits said coupling means (32) to be peeled as a unit from said envelope.
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 1 wherein said envelope has a top end
portion (18), a bottom end portion (26) opposite said top end portion, and opposite side

edges (20,22) extending between said top end portion (18) and said bottom end portion
(26), said side edge portions (20,22) converging toward each other in a direction from said

top end portion to said bottom end portion such that said envelope in plan view is
substantially V-shaped.
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 1 wherein said coupling means (32)
includes a coupling member (32) ad means (50
-56) for securing said coupling member
around a stoma in a fixed position. 
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 3 wherein said coupling member is s
molded annular plastic member (32) formed with a coupling portion (50-56), whereby said

coupling portion is interengagable with a complementary-shaped coupling portion provided
around the stoma.
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 4 wherein said annular plastic
member (32) has a peripheral edge portion (48) formed to permit bending of said edge

portion away from said envelope to initiate peeling of said annular plastic member from
said envelope. 
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 5 wherein
said annular plastic member includes indicator means (48) at said

peripheral edge to indicate where the annular plastic member
is to be initially peeled from said envelope.
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 6 wherein
said indicator means is formed with a touch detector (48) to

permit touch detection of said initial peel section.
The ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 7 wherein
said touch detector is a recess (48) in said peripheral edge. 
An ostomy pouch according to any preceding claim,
wherein said envelope has a top end portion (18), a bottom

end portion (26) opposite said top end portion, and opposite
side edges (20, 22) extending between said top end portion

(18) and said bottom end portion (26), said side edge
portions (20, 22) converging toward each other in a direction

from said top end portion to said bottom end portion such
that said envelope in plan view is substantially V-shaped

with an angle of convergence in the range of approximately
15° to 25°
A method for facilitating flush disposal of an ostomy
pouch comprising,


(a) forming an envelope of flexible plastic sheet
material (12, 14) with a waste inlet opening (30) and a waste

collection chamber, 
(b) bonding a flexible pouch-side coupling member (32)
onto the envelope around the waste inlet opening (30) for co-operating

envelope, and in that the method further comprises:
(c) removing the flexible coupling member (32) from the
envelope when the envelope is ready for disposal to permit

flushing of the envelope down a toilet without any coupling
member attached thereto.
The method of claim 10, wherein the coupling member (32)
is removed from the envelope by peeling the envelope away

from the coupling member.

member (32) is joined to the envelope by an adhesive tape (38) that is

joined to the envelope at a non-adhesive side and which holds
the coupling member it the adhesive side.
The method of claim 10 wherein the removal of
the coupling member from the envelope is initiated at an

initial peel section that is indicated with a touch detector (48).
The method of claim 10 including depositing the
envelope (12,14) in a V-shape.
