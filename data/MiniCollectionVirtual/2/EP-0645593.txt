<ABSTRACT>
An electronic cooling type refrigerator of the invention is basically formed of an 
electronic type thermo-module (3) in a plain plate shape, which is installed in an insulating housing 

(1) to cool an inside of the housing by utilizing Peltier effect of the thermo-module (3). The 
refrigerator further includes a heat absorbing member (4) with fins situated inside the housing 

and heat- conductively connected to a heat absorbing side of the thermo- module (3), and an inner 
fan (9) situated inside the housing for forcibly supplying air in the housing (1) toward the fins 

of the heat absorbing member arranged in rows. The refrigerator is improved in cooling ability 
and is handled easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic cooling type refrigerator directed to a 
portable cooler or cooling box for cooling the inside of the box by utilizing Peltier effect of an 
electronic type thermo-module using thermo-electric cooling elements. An electronic cooling type refrigerator is known in Japanese Patent Publication 
(KOKOKU) No. 5-17469, wherein an electronic type thermo-module using thermo-electric cooling 
elements is assembled in a heat insulating housing or box of the refrigerator for cooling the 
inside of the housing by utilizing Peltier effect of the thermo-module. Figs. 3 and 4 show a structure of a conventional electronic cooling type cooling 
box, wherein numeral 1 is a heat insulating housing and numeral 2 is a lid thereof. In a side wall 
of the heat insulating housing 1, an electronic type thermo-module 3 having a plain plate shape 
and formed of thermo-electric cooling elements is assembled such that a heat absorbing side of 
the thermo-module 3 is oriented inside the housing 1 and the heat radiating side thereof is oriented 
outside the housing 1. The thermo-module 3 is a plain shape module, which is formed of a plurality of 
thermo-electric cooling elements assembled in series. Each cooling element is formed such that 
P type and N type semiconductor elements are connected between two ceramic base boards in the 
form of a small character pi in a Greek letter.  
 A heat absorbing member 4 with fins is heat-conductively 
fixed to the heat absorbing side of the thermoelectric module 3, 
and a heat radiating member 5 with fins is heat-conductively 
fixed to the heat radiating side thereof. A wind channel 6 is 
formed outside the housing 1 to surround the fins 5a of the heat 
radiating member 5, and an outside fan 7 is attached to the wind 
channel 6 to supply outer air to the fins 5a. Numeral 8 is a 
direct current electric source, such as a battery, to supply 
electricity to the thermo-module 3. In the conventional electronic cooling type refrigerator as 
stated above, since heat exchange between air inside the housing 
1 and the heat absorbing member 4 is made based on a natural air 
convection, heat exchange efficiency is low. Thus, the cooling 
efficiency of the thermo-electric module has not been sufficiently 
obtained. DE-A-36 39 089 discloses an electronic cooling type refrigerator 
comprising a flat thermoelectric module installed in an 
insulated housing, a heat absorbing member with fins situated 
inside the housing and heat-conductively connected to a heat 
abs
