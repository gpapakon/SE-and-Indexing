<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
equipment used in processing storage phosphors and more
particularly relates to an autoloader for positioning
cassettes relative to a storage phosphor reader and to
a cassette sensor used therein.It is convenient to handle a storage phosphor
within cassettes that protect the storage phosphor from
extraneous light and damage. This is particularly the
case for storage phosphors in which the latent x-ray
image stored in the storage phosphor is read by photo
electrically detecting an emitted x-ray image formed by
scanning the storage phosphor with stimulating
radiation. It is desirable to retain the storage
phosphor within a cassette except during actual
processing. A hooked extractor can be used with the
storage phosphor cassette to move a storage phosphor
plate to and from a storage phosphor reader for
processing. It is desirable to provide an apparatus to
automate the presentation of such cassettes to such
an extractor so that a number of cassettes could be
processed in succession without attention from an
operator. It is also desirable that such an apparatus
be able to accurately position cassettes sequentially
to simplify removal and reinsertion of the storage
phosphor plate and that the presentation apparatus be
separate from the storage phosphor reader to permit
interchange of units and reduce repair times.In a storage phosphor reader/storage phosphor
cassette autoloader system, it is desirable that the
autoloader have several loading sites, a read site, and
several unloading sites. Since cassettes of different
sizes can be accommodated at each site, it is desirable
to provide a sensor which is capable of sensing
different size cassettes. In EP-A-0 544 326 an X-ray cassette positioner is
described which uses conveyor belts for positioning of
the cassettes and optical sensors for detecting
cassettes at certain positions. There are openings in
the conveyor belts through which the cassettes can be
detected by the optical sensor. These openings however
weakens the belts.It is therefore also desirable that a cassette
sensor be provided which does not result in weakening of
the autoloader positioning belts, such as might be
necessary if photosensors are used to sense cassettes
through holes or cutouts in the belts. It is also
desirable that the cassette sensor be reliable,
maintenance free, inexpensive and relatively simple.From the US-A-4 330 284 a capacitive sensor probe
is known which is moved across the surface of a model
board to sense its distance to

<CLAIMS>
A storage phosphor cassette autoloader(10)
for storing X-ray cassettes (20) and for positioning the X-ray cassettes

relative to a storage phosphor reader (12) comprising:

first and second endless conveyor belts (64),
said conveyor belts being spaced apart and having a

plurality of outwardly extending shelves (78) in vertical
alignment for defining a plurality of said cassettes, so as to define a storage phosphor cassette

read site (84) therebetween corresponding to the position
in the autoloader in which a cassette (20) carried by a pair of shelves can be accessed

by the reader (12) and so as to define a plurality of storage phosphor
cassette retaining sites (86, 88), said belts (64) being

of nonmetallic material;
a mounting assembly (54) for movably mounting each
of said conveyor belts (64);
a drive (90) operatively connected to said mounting
assembly (54) and said first and second conveyor belts (64)

for driving said conveyor belts in unison to transfer
cassettes (20) in said retaining sites (86, 88) serially

through said read site (84), 
characterized by
a capacitive sensor (120 ; 140) located at said
read site (84) or at one of said retaining sites (86, 88) on

the opposite side of said belt (64) with respect to said shelves (78) defining said sites,
to sense the presence of a cassette (20) at said sites (84,

86, 88), said sensor (120)
being capable of sensing a cassette (20) having a metallic portion

through said belts (64).
The autoloader of claim 1 wherein said capacitive sensor (120 ;
140) is included in a detection

circuit (124) for generating a sensor signal, when said sensor (120)
senses a cassette (20) at said read or retaining site (84, 86, 88).
The autoloader of claim 1 wherein said capacitive
sensor (120) includes an electrically conductive base (130),

an insulator (132) and an electrically conductive capacitive
sensing element (134). 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 wherein
said capacitive sensor (140) includes an electrically

conductive base (142), a first insulator (144), a
conductive shield (146), a second insulator (148) and

an electrically conductive capacitive sensing element
(150).
The autoloader (10) of claim 2 wherein
said detection circuit (124) includes a modulation

section (160),(162),(164) for modulating an oscillating
signal with said sensor signal when a cassette is detected and a demodulation

section (166),(168),(170),(172),(174) for separating
said sensor signal from noise to produce a noise free

cassette presence signal.
The autoloader (10) of claim 5 wherein
said modulation section (160),(162),(164) of said

detection circuit (124) includes an oscillator (160)
for producing an oscillating signal and a balanced

bridge (162), including said capacitive sensor (120 ;
140), for modulating said oscillating signal with said

sensor signal.
