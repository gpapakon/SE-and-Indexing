<CLAIMS>
A device for mechanically influencing the lungs for the release of mucus, having a 
support (10; 30) which is covered by a plurality of striker bodies (15) which can be 

driven individually or in groups, characterised in that the support is constructed in the 
manner of a waistcoat (10) with two front parts (10.1, 10.2) and a back part (10.3), 

the parts of which are at least partly coupled to each other by means of longitudinally 
adjustable tapes, and each comprise a plurality of striker bodies (15). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises a controller for the 
sequential control of the drive devices (20) of the individual striker bodies (15) or of 

groups of striker bodies. 
A device according to either one of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the striker 
bodies (15) are disposed in a water-tight manner between two external walls (27, 29; 

33, 35) of the support (10; 30), of which at least the inner wall (27; 35) facing the 
patient's body is of flexible construction, at least in the region of the striker bodies 

(15). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the striker 
bodies (15) are constructed as discs which are concave towards the patient's body and 

which are coupled to their drive device (20) on their back face remote from the 
patient's body. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the striker bodies (15) are 
constructed as cup bodies of rubber-like resilience. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the regions of 
the support (10; 30) which comprise the striker bodies (15) are delimited by 

cushioning chambers (24; 34) which are at least partially inflatable in order to adjust  
 

the distance of the striker bodies (15) in their inoperative state from the body of the 
patient (11). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the striker 
bodies (15) are provided with pneumatic drive devices (20) which comprise at least 

one compressed air chamber (19.1) of variable volume, which can be connected via 
the controller to a compressed air source (42) and which can be deaerated. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the striker 

bodies (15) are coupled to electromagnetic drive devices which are sequentially 
controlled electrically.
