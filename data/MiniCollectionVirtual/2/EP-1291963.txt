<ABSTRACT>
An antenna capable of transmitting/receiving waves in multi-ranged

frequency bands providing high antenna gain, reliability and productivity, and a
radio communication apparatus using the same. The feed portion is

electrically connected with the antenna element portion at its one end, and with
the radio-frequency circuit of the apparatus at the other end. The dielectric

material-made core rod mechanically supports the antenna element portion.
The dielectric material-made radome partially covers the antenna element and

feed portions. The antenna element portion is formed of an approximately
helical-shaped portion and an approximately meander-shaped portion, both of

which are made of a thin-belt-shaped conductive plate and concentrically formed
on the core rod. Properly adjusting of the helical-shaped and the meander-shaped

portions can provide impedance characteristics optimal for multi-ranged
frequency bands.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna fixed to a radio
communication apparatus for mobile communications and a radio
communication apparatus using the same.In recent years, as a demand for mobile communications drastically
increases, radio communication apparatuses have been developed in a wide
variety of forms. An example of the diversity is a radio communication
apparatus capable of transmitting/receiving radio waves in multi-ranged
frequency bands so that a single radio communication apparatus can handle as
much information as possible. Such an apparatus includes an antenna having
desirable impedance characteristics over multi-ranged frequency bands.A mobile phone system is the typical example of the mobile
communications, which is now widely used all over the world. The frequency
bandwidth for the mobile phone system varies by region: for the frequency
bandwidth for digital mobile telephone system, Personal Digital Cellular 800
(PDC 800) in Japan uses the frequency in the range from 810 to 960 MHz. On
the other hand, in the West, the range from 890 to 960 MHz is for Group Special
Mobile Community (GSM), the range from 1,710 to 1,880 MHz for Personal
Communication Network (PCN), and the range from 1,850 to 1,990 MHz for
Personal Communication System (PCS). Generally, for the mobile phone
corresponding to each of the multi-ranged frequency bands, a helical antenna
element formed of helically wound conductive wire is widely used. An antenna using a helical conductor is shown in EP-A-0 893 841. Further this
reference describes a method for manufacturing such helical conductors.From EP-A-0 987 788 a helix antenna is known, which further comprises a stub
inserted into the helix at its free end.EP-A-0 833 455 shows an antenna module for use with a mobile telephone which
comprises two separate antennas. The mobile telephone may switch to either of the
separate antennas to optimize reception/transmission.A chip antenna provided with plural antenna elements is described in EP-A-0 777
293. In a parallelepiped substrate, two conductors of helical or meandering shape
are arranged side by side. The conductors are connected with a feeding terminal in
series or in parallel.Fig. 12 is a general sectional view of the prior-art antenna for two
frequency bands - for the range from 890 to 960 MHz of GSM and for the range
from 1,710 to 1,880 MHz of PCN. Figs. 13 and 14 are the graphs that
represent the frequency characteristics of voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)
showing impedance characteristics.In antenna 8
