<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to stable (cyclo)aliphatic polyisocyanate compositions which can be obtained by phosgene-free processes, preferably by thermal cleavage of (cyclo)aliphatic polycarbonates and which comprise carbon dioxide, expediently in an amount of up to 0.3% by weight, for stabilisation purposes, and to a process for their preparation.
