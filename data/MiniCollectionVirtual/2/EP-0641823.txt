<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tire with a tread 
which is quantitatively reinforced with silica where 

the tread is composed of cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber, 
a high vinyl polybutadiene rubber and, optionally a 

medium vinyl polybutadiene rubber. In one aspect, the 
tread rubber can also contain a minor amount of cis 

1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tire having a rubber
tread which is reinforced with silica. In one aspect,
the tread is comprised of a specified multiple
component rubber blend reinforced with a quantitative
amount of silica or a combination of silica and carbon
black. In one aspect, the tread rubber is required to
be composed of cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber and high
vinyl polybutadiene rubber and or medium
vinyl polybutadiene rubber.Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally
prepared with a rubber tread which can be a blend of
various rubbers which is typically reinforced with
carbon black.In one aspect, rubbers are evaluated, selected
and blended for a purpose of achieving desired tire
tread properties and particularly a balance of tire
tread characteristic properties, mainly, rolling
resistance, traction and wear.For various applications utilizing rubber
including applications such as tires and particularly
tire treads, sulfur cured rubber is utilized which
contains substantial amounts of reinforcing filler(s).
Carbon black is commonly used for such purpose and
normally provides or enhances good physical properties
for the sulfur cured rubber. Particulate silica is
also sometimes used for such purpose, particularly
when the silica is used in conjunction with a coupling
agent. In some cases, a combination of silica and
carbon black is utilized for reinforcing fillers for
various rubber products, including treads for tires. Various rubber compositions have been prepared
for various purposes, some of which have included tire
treads, which contain a polybutadiene containing a
degree of 1,2-configuration, sometimes referred to as
vinyl content. Representative of such various
compositions include those, for example, taught in
various patent specifications such as US -A-3,937,681
relating to a tire tread of polybutadiene
containing twenty-five to fifty percent of its monomer
units in a 1,2-position. GB-A-1,166,832
relates to a tire tread of "high vinyl" butadiene
rubber containing at least fifty percent of its
monomer units in a 1,2-position.
US-A-3,978,165 relates to
a composition, taught to be useful for tire treads
composed of (a) "medium vinyl" polybutadiene, (b)
polybutadiene and (c) butadiene/styrene rubbers.
US-A-3,827,991, 4,220,564 and 4,224,197
relate to combinations of polybutadiene containing at
least seventy percent of 1,2-configuration with
various other rubbers. US-A-4,192,366 relates to
a tire with tread of a blend of cis-polyisoprene
rubber and a medium vinyl polybutadiene rubber cured
with an
