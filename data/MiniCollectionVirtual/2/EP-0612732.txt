 is unsubstituted or substituted, linear, branched or cyclic C2-C12-alkyl and in which 1 to 3 CH2 groups of the alkyl radical can be replaced in each case by oxygen, at a temperature of 150 - 175@C in a halogen-free inert solvent whose boiling point is equal to or greater than 150@C, or in a mixture of two or more such solvents, without an addition of an aromatic sulphonic acid as catalyst. Using the process according to the invention, 2-(cyanomethyl)benzimidazoles are prepared in good yields and high purity without the use of a catalyst.

 groups of the alkyl radical can 
in each case be replaced by oxygen, at a temperature 

of 150 - 175°C, in a halogen-free solvent which is 
inert as regards the reactants under the selected 

reaction conditions, has a boiling point of 150°C or 
above and is selected from the group consisting of 

cycloaliphatic substances, olefins, cycloolefins, or  
 

aromatic or araliphatic substances, it also being 
possible for said solvent to contain oxygen atoms, 

or in a mixture of two or more of such solvents, 
without adding an aromatic sulfonic acid as 

catalyst. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction is carried out at a temperature of 155 to 

170°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein n is 
the number 1. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein R
1
 is methyl or methoxy. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein n is 
the number 0. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein R
2
 is ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, 
n-pentyl, iso-pentyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-octyl, 

2-methoxyethyl or 2-ethoxyethyl. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein a mixture of various cyanoacetic 

esters of the formula (III) is employed. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 7, wherein ethyl cyanoacetate is employed in a 

mixture with n-butyl cyanoacetate or with iso-butyl 
cyanoacetate. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 8, wherein the solvent is an aromatic, 

araliphatic or alkoxyaromatic substance whose boiling 
point is 150°C or above or an aromatic hydrocarbon 

fraction whose lower limit of the boiling 
range is 150°C or above.  

 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 8, wherein the solvent is cumene, mesitylene, 

tetralin, phenetole or a mixture thereof. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
