<ABSTRACT>
A process is shown for fabricating upholstered articles 
in which a cover (14) is formed of a laminated material having an 

outer layer (18) and an inner foam sheet layer (20). The foam sheet has 
an interior surface treated to form a skin to prevent 

penetration of a liquid urethane foam into the cover. The 
surface is also embossed to produce dimples in the treated 

surface overcoming the increase in foam stiffness caused by the 
surface treatment thereby enabling the foam to bend without 

creasing the treated surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of fabricating 
an upholstered article and in particular to the treatment of 
upholstery material to reduce permeability of the material and 
to reduce the variability of other material properties and 
characteristics. Several upholstered articles, particularly seat 
components, headliners and other vehicle interior trim 
components, are being fabricated using a pour-in-place foam 
molding process in which a foam pad is molded by pouring a 
liquid foaming agent onto an upholstery cover to form a 
resilient foam pad bonded to the cover. Such a pour-in-place 
process reduces the number of manufacturing steps required from 
previous methods in which a shaped foam pad is first molded or 
cut and then attached to the cover. While a pour-in-place process has its advantages, it is 
not without its own difficulties. For example, steps must be 
taken to prevent the seepage of the liquid foaming agent 
through the cover, either through a porous fabric or through 
stitching holes at the seams in a vinyl or leather cover. The fabric, vinyl or leather outer cover is typically 
bonded to a thin foam sheet forming a laminated upholstery 
material. This foam sheet gives the desired stiffness 
characteristics to the cover. The foam is porous by nature 
such that when contacted by the liquid foaming agent, it will 
allow the foaming agent to seep through the foam sheet layer. 
The liquid foam may seep entirely through the foam layer and  
 
through a fabric outer layer or through the stitch holes in a 
leather or vinyl outer layer, thus damaging the cover. One approach to preventing the liquid foam seepage through 
the cover is to use a plastic film barrier along the inner 
surface of the foam sheet. While a film barrier is effective 
in preventing seepage, it is expensive and has undesirable 
effects. A film barrier is undesirable because it prevents the 
venting of gases produced by the liquid foam agent, creating 
voids in the foam, it prevents bonding between the poured 
urethane and the cover and it reduces the breathability of the 
upholstered article. For seat assembly components in 
particular, it is desirable that the article breath for the 
comfort of a seat occupant. It is an object of the present invention to develop a 
process to prevent seepage of the liquid foam through an 
upholstery cover when used in pour-in-place foam molding while 
maintaining the breathability of the cover. It is a feature of the present invention to treat the 
interior foam surface of the

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating a foam sheet having 
first and second surfaces comprising the steps of: 

   pressing said foam sheet and applying heat to 
said first surface to heat set the foam sheet at said 

first surface by permanently compressing the foam cells 
thus forming a skin at said first surface having a reduced 

porosity as compared to the foam that is not heat set; and 
   embossing said first surface to form a plurality 

of dimples in said first surface. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said dimples 
comprise dimples which are circular or multidirectional in 

shape. 
A foam sheet product made by the process of 
claim 1 or 2. 
A method of manufacturing a laminated 
upholstery material comprising: 

   providing a thin foam sheet and treating it in 
accordance with the method of claim 1 or 2; 

   providing an outer cover sheet; 
   bonding said outer cover sheet to said second 

surface of said foam sheet forming a sheet of laminated 
upholstery material. 
A laminated upholstery material made by the 
process of claim 4. 
A method of fabricating a padded upholstered 
article comprising the steps of: 

   providing a thin foam sheet and treating it in 
accordance with the method of claim 1 or 2; 

   providing an outer cover sheet; 
   joining said outer cover sheet to said second 

surface of said foam sheet forming a sheet of laminated 
upholstery material; and 

   joining a resilient foam pad to said first 
surface of said foam sheet to cover at least a portion of 

said resilient foam pad. 
The method of claim 6, wherein said 
resilient foam pad is joined to said first surface of said 

foam sheet by pouring a liquid foaming agent onto said 
treated first surface and allowing said agent to cure to 

form said resilient foam pad in contact with said treated 
first surface of said foam sheet, said skin on said 

treated surface allowing limited permeation of said 
foaming agent into said foam sheet to join said resilient 

foam pad to said laminated upholstery material. 
A padded upholstered article made by the 
process of claim 6. 
A padded upholstered article comprising: 
   think foam sheet having first and second 

surfaces, said first surface having a skin with a reduced 
porosity as compared to the remainder of said foam sheet 

and a pattern embossed in said first surface;
 

   an outer cover sheet joined to said second 
surface of said foam sheet; and 

   a resilient foam pad joined to said second 
surface of said foam sheet whereby said foam sheet and 

said outer cover serve to cover at least a portion of said 
resilient foam pad. 
The article of claim 9, wherein said 
embossed pattern comprises a plurality of circular dimples 

or a plurality of dimples that are multi-directional in 
shape.
