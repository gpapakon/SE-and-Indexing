<ABSTRACT>
Proanthocyanidin-containing compositions with
excellent proanthocyanidin stability, as well as drinks,

foods, cosmetics and medicaments containing these
compositions, are provided by admixing a vitamin B
6

derivative or its salt in proanthocyanidin. Also shown is
a method for stabilizing proanthocyanidin to prevent its

color change, etc. caused by oxidative polymerization and
the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions containing
proanthocyanidin, drinks, foods, cosmetics and medicaments
containing these compositions and a method for stabilizing
proanthocyanidin.It is known that proanthocyanidin, which is a
substance contained in a number of plants and having a
strong antioxidant effect, is susceptible to oxidation and
quickly undergoes oxidative polymerization in the presence
of oxygen, thereby showing a color change.Conventional techniques to stabilize proanthocyanidin
mainly include addition of potassium pyrosulfite (e.g., to
wine) and addition of ascorbic acid (e.g., to apple juice).JP-A-6-336420 discloses cosmetics containing sodium
hydrogensulfite, 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-disulfonic acid,
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid or phytic acid to
prevent the color change of proanthocyanidin with the
passage of time (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application").On the other hand, examples of methods for
stabilizing polyphenol or preventing its color change or 
compositions for stabilizing polyphenol or preventing its
color change are as follows: (1) a method for preventing
the color change of polyphenol by adding a porphyrin zinc
complex and an organic reducing agent to polyphenol as
disclosed in JP-B-8-2819 (the term "JP-B" as used herein
means an "examined Japanese patent publication"); (2) skin
cosmetics containing a polyphenol compound together with a
sucrose higher fatty acid ester disclosed in JP-A-5-112441;
(3) skin cosmetics containing a polyphenol compound
together with an alkyl glucoside disclosed in JP-A-5-163131;
and (4) a method for preventing the color change
of skin preparations for an external use which contain a
polyphenol compound carrying at least 3 phenolic hydroxyl
groups by adding a polyhydric alcohol or a sugar to the
preparations disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2,744,572.An object of the invention is to provide
proanthocyanidin-containing compositions having excellent
proanthocyanidin stability, as well as drinks, foods,
cosmetics and medicaments containing these compositions,
and a method for stabilizing proanthocyanidin so as to
prevent the color change, etc. caused by the oxidative
polymerization, etc., thereof.The invention provides compositions containing
proanthocyanidin and a vitamin B6 derivative or its salt, 
and drinks, foods, cosmetics and medicaments containing
these compositions.The invention further provides a method for
stabilizing proanthocyanidin characterized by blending
proanthocyanidin with a
