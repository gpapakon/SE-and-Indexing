<ABSTRACT>
A machine for the silk-screen printing of flat sheets of glass or the 
like comprising a supporting structure (1) capable of moving parallel 

to the printing plane of a frame (3) and equipped with a spreading 
squeegee (8) and a printing doctor (7), both capable of moving in a 

direction perpendicular to the plane of frame (3) and independently of 
one another, comprising a device with automatic action for the removal 

of ink residue from such screen frame (3) and consisting of at least 
one suction unit (10) capable of moving in a perpendicular direction 

with respect to such screen frame (3) simultaneously with such 
spreading squeegee (8), suction nozzle (14) of such unit being 

connected to a suction header (15) and positioned between such doctor 
(7) and squeegee (8), according to the direction of travel thereof, so 

as to make possible the continuous suction of the ink residue and of 
any impurities liable to clog the screen during any spreading movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a silk-screen printing machine equipped
with an automatic suction device for the complete removal of ink
residue from the screen frame used in the printing of flat sheets such
as sheets of glass, paper, fabric and the like.As is known, the so-called silk-screen process uses for the creation of
images, lettering, patterns and the like on flat sheets of glass, paper
and the like the transfer of inks whether black or coloured, which are
spread on a mesh (screen) frame in which such mesh has openings for the
passage of the ink arranged in such a way as to match the pattern or
image to be printed on the flat sheet, placed in contact with a fixed
supporting surface.More particularly, the current silk-screen printing machines used to
print flat media (sheets of glass or of another material, sheets of
paper and the like) provide a fixed supporting structure with a flat
surface on which is placed in a stable manner the medium to be printed
and, above the latter, a perforated frame, normally termed the "screen
or printing frame". Above such screen frame is positioned a structure
capable of being moved, parallel to the plane of the sheet to be
printed, from one end of the frame to the opposite end and vice versa.
Such structure carries an initial support, in the form of an arm, to
the lower end of which is secured a squeegee used to spread the ink on
the underlying frame, and a second supporting arm having at its lower
end a doctor intended to force the ink, previously spread by the
squeegee on the screen, through the latter so as to print the
underlying sheet. The supports or arms of the spreading squeegee and of the doctor are
capable of being moved in opposition to one another according to a
direction perpendicular to the printing plane and in both senses, in
order to make possible an initial outward stroke parallel to the
printing plane with the squeegee lowered into contact with the screen
and the doctor raised, and a second return stroke with the squeegee
raised end the doctor lowered, by which means printing is achieved.The use of such known silk-screen printing machines poses in practice
a number of serious disadvantages, especially in the printing of
peripheral strips of sheets of gloss, for which special arrangements
are required in order to carry out printing in a fully correct manner.Moreover, such type of printing requires that the surface of the screen
whose perimeter determines the printing of the edge strip shall be
smaller than the surface of the sheet of glass to

<CLAIMS>
A flat sheet of glass (2) silk-screen printing machine
comprising a supporting structure (1) capable of

moving parallel to the printing plane of a screen frame (3) and
equipped with a spreading squeegee (8) and a printing doctor (7),

joined to a movable structure (4) both capable of moving in a
direction perpendicular to the plane of the screen frame (3) and

independently of one another, wherein such screen frame (3) has
larger dimensions than those of the flat sheet (2) to be printed

comprising a device for the automatic removal of ink residue from
such screen frame (3) consisting of at least one suction unit

(10) integrally secured to such movable structure (4) and capable
of moving in a perpendicular direction with respect to such

screen frame (3) simultaneously with such spreading squeegee (8) a
suction nozzle (14) of such unit being connected to a suction

header (15) and positioned downstream such squeegee (8),
along its direction (A) of working travel, so as to

make possible the continuous suction of the ink residue and of
any impurities liable to clog the screen during any spreading

movement, the stroke of such suction unit being set to a length
at least equal to the longitudinal dimension of the frame (3),

characterized in that such device comprises an arm (11)
parallel to the screen frame (3) whose opposite ends are respectively

rigidly joined to the movable structure (4) and to a slide (12)
carrying a rod (13) whose translation to/from the screen (3) is 

operated by pneumatic
means, such rod (13) and such slide (12) being

tilted with respect to the plane vertical to the printing plane. 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that inside such
suction duct (15) is provided a removable and/or replaceable filter

element capable of retaining any surplus ink and any impurities present 
in the ink and/or on screen frame (3).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that suction
nozzle (14) of such suction device (10) has a transverse dimension at

least equal to the width of screen frame (3).
