<ABSTRACT>
A disc reproduction apparatus includes a disc 
reproduction assembly (2) and a tray accommodating unit 

(3, 4) positioned at either side of the disc reproduction 
assembly (2) on the upper face of a main body (1) of the 

apparatus. A disc tray group (12) including a plurality 
of disc trays (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) sequentially connected 

in series by a joint (18) is provided in a movable manner 
between the tray accommodating units at either side of the 

disc reproduction assembly (2). In accordance with the 
travel of the disc tray group (12), one disc tray is 

selectively positioned in the disc reproduction assembly 
(2) and the remaining disc trays are stored in the tray 

accommodating units (3, 4). According to this structure, 
the number of loadable discs can be increased without 

unduly increasing the size of the entire apparatus and the 
complexity of the selecting mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disc reproduction
apparatuses, and more particularly, to a disc reproduction
apparatus including a disc changer function that can have
a plurality of discs loaded for sequentially selecting a
desired disc for reproduction.Conventional disc reproduction apparatuses with a
disc changer function are already proposed such as a disc
reproduction apparatus with the so-called roulette type
disc changer (refer to Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 4-10274,
for example) that has a plurality of discs mounted
annularly on a round disc table, wherein a desired disc is
transferred for reproduction to a disc reproduction
assembly by a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of
the disc table, or a disc reproduction apparatuswith the
so-called stocker type disc changer (refer to Japanese
Patent Laying-Open No. 3-83262, for example) that selects
a desired disc out of a plurality of discs accommodated in
a stocker at a predetermined pitch by moving vertically
the stocker, whereby the selected disc is chucked by a
disc moving means to be transferred to a disc reproduction 
assembly for reproduction.The above-described roulette type disc changer had a
problem that an increase in the loaded number of discs
will increase the diameter of the disc table in proportion
to the increased number to significantly increase the size
of the apparatus. In order to avoid increase in the size
of the apparatus, the number of discs that can be loaded
was limited.In the above-described stocker type disc changer,
increase in the thickness of the stocker itself can be
suppressed even if the loadable number of discs was
increased since discs are accommodated in a stacked manner
at a predetermined pitch. However, this type requires a
complex operation of moving vertically the stocker for
selecting a disc, taking out the selected disc from the
stocker, and transferring the disc to the disc
reproduction assembly. In order to realize this complex
operation, the mechanism becomes complicated with increase
in weight of the apparatus.Furthermore, a disc reproduction apparatus including
the above-described two types of disc changer had a
problem at set forth in the following when combined with a
portable radio cassette tape recorder. In the case of a
roulette type disc changer, the disc table becomes too
large with respect to the size of the main body of the 
radio cassette tape recorder. This become a bottleneck to
make difficult the realization of such a combination. In
the case of a stocker type disc changer, such a
