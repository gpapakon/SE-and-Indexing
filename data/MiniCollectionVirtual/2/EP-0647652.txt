<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for the preparation of 
saccharide fatty acid polyesters via an intermolecular 

transesterification reaction is provided. A saccharide 
lower acyl ester (for example, sucrose octaacetate) is 

reacted with a fatty acid lower alkyl ester (for example, 
methyl stearate) in the presence of an alkali metal 

alkoxide catalyst to produce a saccharide fatty acid 
polyester. The reaction is carried out at relatively low 

temperatures in the absence of solvent. The relatively 
low molecular weight by-product ester is removed from the 

reaction mixture during the course of the reaction in 
order to drive the equilibrium transesterification 

reaction to completion. The saccharide fatty acid 
polyesters are useful as fat substitutes or low-calorie 

fats in food compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides an improved method for 
the preparation of saccharide fatty acid polyesters, 
especially sucrose fatty acid polyesters, via an 
intermolecular transesterification reaction of the acyl 
ester or hydroxyl groups of a saccharide with a fatty 
acid ester or esters. The improved method of this 
invention essentially eliminates or reduces the hazards 
(i.e., fire or explosion) associated with the use of 
molten alkali metal catalysts in the prior one-step, 
solvent-free transesterification reaction methods used 
for the production of saccharide fatty acid polyesters. 
Additionally, the improved method of this invention 
provides for more rapid conversion to the desired 
products and provides products having better (i.e., 
lighter) color characteristics. The sucrose fatty acid 
polyesters produced by the improved method of this 
invention are especially useful as fat substitutes in 
food applications and products. The human consumption of fats in various 
foodstuffs contributes significantly to obesity. High 
fat diets also contribute to various human diseases such 
as heart and coronary diseases. One method of reducing 
obesity and/or diseases such as heart and coronary 
diseases in the human population is to reduce the 
consumption of fat. In recent years, fat substitutes or 
low-calorie fats have attracted increasing attention as a 
method of reducing the fat and calorie content of 
foodstuffs. The objective is to provide edible fats with 
reduced absorption and digestive properties with minimal  
 
side effects and with acceptable taste and feel 
characteristics when incorporated into food compositions. Transesterification reactions have been used to 
prepare saccharide polyesters with reduced absorption and 
digestive properties. Such transesterification reactions 
generally required high temperatures and/or toxic 
solvents (such as dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, 
dimethylsulfoxide, and the like) and were not, therefore, 
generally suitable for the preparation of fat substitutes 
for use in food applications. More recently, Meyer et al., U.S. Patent 
4,840,815 (issued June 20, 1989), and Meyer et al., PCT 
Publication WO 92/0360 (published March 5, 1992), 
provided a one-stage, solvent-free, low-temperature, low-pressure 
process for the preparation of saccharide fatty 
acid polyesters. The Meyer et al. process involves 
reacting a mixture of a lower acyl ester saccharide, a 
fatty acid lower alkyl ester, and an alkali metal 
catalyst at a reaction temperature of 100° to
