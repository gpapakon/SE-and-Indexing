area and capable of storing data by itself without need 
for cooling at a cryogenic temperature, and a memory

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
element suited for integration with a high
density and a semiconductor memory device implemented by
using the same.Heretofore, polycrystalline silicon transistors
have been used as elements for constituting a
static random access memory device (referred to as SRAM
in abbreviation). One of the relevant prior art
techniques is described in T. Yamanaka et al: IEEE
International Electron Device Meeting, pp. 477-480
(1990). By making the most of polycrystalline silicon
transistors, integration density of the integrated
circuit can be enhanced, the reason for which can be
explained by the fact that the polycrystalline silicon
transistor can be formed in stack or lamination atop a
conventional bulk MOSFET (Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
Field Effect Transistor) formed on a surface of a
semiconductor substrate with an insulation film being
interposed between the polycrystalline silicon transistor
and the bulk MOSFET. In the SRAM, implementation
of a memory cell for one bit requires four bulk MOSFETs
and two polycrystalline silicon transistors. However,
because the polycrystalline silicon transistors can be
stacked atop the bulk MOSFETs, a single memory cell of 
the SRAM can be implemented with an area which substantially
corresponds to that required for the bulk
MOSFETs.A further device of this type is disclosed in EP-A-0 366 146.As another preceding technique related to the
invention, there may be mentioned a single-electron
memory described in K. Nakazato et al: Electronics
Letters, Vol. 29, No. 4, pp. 384-385 (1993). It is
reported that a memory could have been realized by
controlling electron on a one-by-one basis. It is
however noted that the operation temperature is as very
low as on the order of 30 mK.As a further prior art technique related to
the invention, there may be mentioned one which is
directed to the study of RTN (Random Telegraph Noise) of
MOSFET, as is disclosed in F. Fang et al: 1990 Symposium
on VLSI Technology, pp. 37-38 (1990). More specifically,
when a drain current of a MOSFET is measured for a
predetermined time under the constant-voltage condition,
there makes appearance such phenomenon that state
transition takes place at random between a high-current
state and a low-current state. This phenomenon is
referred to as the RTN, a cause for which can be
explained by the capture or entrapping of a single
electron in a level node existing at an interface
between silicon (Si) and silicon oxide (SiO2) and the
release therefrom, whereby the drain
