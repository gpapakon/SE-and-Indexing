<ABSTRACT>
Biodegradable, liquid impervious monolayer film compositions are disclosed. In particular, the monolayer films comprise composite structures derived from blends of biodegradable polymers. The biodegradable polymers are selected from the categories of moisture sensitive polymers, thermally sensitive polymers, mechanically limited polymers, polymers not easily processed into films, hydrolytically cleavable polymers, and degradable elastomers. The biodegradable polymers are combined in various ways to overcome the deficiencies of the individual components, yet at the same time impart specific performance properties to the film. The monolayer film compositions are suitable for use as backsheets in disposable absorbent products including diapers, adult incontinent pads, sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid impervious films
comprising blends of biodegradable thermoplastic polymers. The films
are especially suitable for use as backsheets in articles such as
diapers, sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and the like, which are
adapted for absorbing various bodily fluids. The films herein may
also be used in a sealable packaging film, plastic garbage bags, etc.A wide variety of absorbent articles designed to be efficient
for the absorption of body fluids such as blood, urine, menses, and
the like, are known. Disposable products of this type generally
comprise some sort of fluid-permeable topsheet material, an absorbent
core, and a fluid-impermeable backsheet material. Heretofore, such
absorbent structures have been prepared using, for example, topsheet
materials prepared from woven, nonwoven, or porous formed-film
polyethylene or polypropylene materials. Backsheet materials
typically comprise flexible polyethylene sheets. Absorbent core
materials typically comprise wood pulp fibers or wood pulp fibers in
combination with absorbent gelling materials. One aspect of such
absorbent articles that has recently been considered is their
disposability. Although such products largely comprise materials
which would be expected ultimately to degrade, and although products
of this type contribute only a very small percentage of the total
solid waste materials generated by consumers each year, nevertheless,
there is currently a perceived need to devise such disposable
products from materials which are compostable.A conventional disposable absorbent product is already to a
large extent compostable. A typical disposable diaper, for example,
consists of about 80% of compostable materials, e.g., wood pulp 
fibers, and the like. In the composting process soiled disposable
absorbent articles are shredded and commingled with organic waste
prior to the composting per se. After composting is complete, the
non-compostable particles are screened out. In this manner even
today's absorbent articles can successfully be processed in
commercial composting plants.Nevertheless, there is a need for reducing the amount of
non-compostable materials in disposable absorbent articles. There is
a particular need to replace polyethylene backsheets in absorbent
articles with liquid impervious films of compostable material,
because the backsheet is typically one of the largest non-compostable
components of a conventional disposable absorbent article.In addition to being compostable, the films employed as
backsheets
