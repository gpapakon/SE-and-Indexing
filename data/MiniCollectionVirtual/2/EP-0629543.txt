<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support-post coupling for tarpaulin frames of lorries and trailers, which tarpaulin frames are formed from longitudinal frame members (1) and cross frame members (2) supported against the loading platform via upright support posts (3). The support posts (3) each comprise a profiled portion provided at the top and bottom with a respective device for connection, on the one hand, to the upper longitudinal frame members (1) of the tarpaulin frame and, on the other hand, to the longitudinal struts of a loading platform. For simplifying the insertion and removal of individual support posts (3) from the tarpaulin assembly it is provided that the device for connecting the support post to the upper longitudinal frame member or cross frame member of the tarpaulin frame comprises a push-in and swivel locking device.

Support post coupling device for roof frames of trucks and trailers in the form of 
lengthwise (1) and crosswise struts (2) supported on the loading platform (5) on 

upright support posts (3), in which the support posts each comprise a profiled 
section provided at the top and the bottom with a mechanism to connect on the 

one hand with the upper lengthwise struts of the roof frame and on the other 
hand with the lengthwise shafts of the loading platform, characterised in that the 

coupling for connecting the support post (3) with the upper lengthwise (1) or 
crosswise strut (2) of the roof frame is formed by a plug-in- pivot locking 

mechanism, whereby the plug-in pivot locking mechanism for connecting the 
support post (3) with the lengthwise strut (1) of the roof frame at the top 

comprises an eye (6) on the side of the post and a pin (8) on the side of the roof 
and a locking plate (9) having a detent recess (11) and a locking mechanism 

comprising a locking nose (7). 
Support post coupling device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
plug-in connection comprising the pin (8) and eye (6) is arranged parallel to the 

lengthwise extension of the lengthwise strut (1) of the roof frame. 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
the pivot locking mechanism comprises a locking nose (7) aligned tangentially 

in relation to the outer periphery of the eye (6) on the support post (3) and a 
detent recess (11) in the form of a longitudinal hole in a locking plate (9) 

connectable to the upper lengthwise strut (1) of the roof frame. 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 

the pin (8) of the plug-in connection has a smaller cross section than the inside 
diameter of the eye (6) on the support post (3). 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the locking nose (7) is furnished with lengthwise (12) and side flanges (13) 

converging to a point.  
 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the longitudinal hole (11) in the locking plate (9) forming the detent recess is 

furnished with straight rectangular peripheral walls and is arranged 
asymmetrically in relation to the longitudinal axis of the support post (3). 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the lengthwise extension of the longitudinal hole (11) corresponds to the middle 

length of the locking nose (7). 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 
the locking plate (9) and the pin bearer (10) are arranged on a coupling part for 

connection with the upper lengthwise strut (1) of the roof frame. 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
the coupling part comprises an essentially U-shaped support element (14) 

partly surrounding the roof frame and at least one locking mechanism (15) for 
securing to the lengthwise strut (1) of the roof frame. 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 9, characterised in that 
the coupling element comprises two locking devices (15) arranged 

symmetrically in relation to the locking plate (9) for connecting with the 
lengthwise strut (1) of the roof frame and in that the two locking mechanisms 

(15) are each in the form of a spring-loaded catch. 
Support post coupling device according to claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the locking plate (9) is formed by a blank of flat material and is connected to the 

support element (14) of the coupling part by welding and in that a mount (17) for 
a reinforcing strut of the roof frame is connected to the support element (14).
