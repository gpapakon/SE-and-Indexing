<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling the ink supply in a halftone printing machine, in particular an offset printing machine, is described. Both in the case of a reference master and on the printed sheet, the standard colour values of the four-colour combined halftone print are determined at test regions located within the subject. For the printing colour black, the infrared colour density is determined within the close infrared. These standard colour values of the four-colour combined print are converted by linear transformation into standard colour values which correspond to the combined printing of only the three chromatic colours. In this case, the coefficients of this transformation depend on the infrared colour density of the printing colour black, for which the corresponding correlations are determined empirically. The effective colour area for the printing colour black depends on the infrared colour density which is likewise determined empirically. The effective colour areas for the chromatic colours are calculated using a modified approach according to Neugebauer using the transformed standard colour values.

Process for controlling the ink feed of a half tone 
working printing press, particularly an offset 

printing press, in which in selected test regions of 
the image of a proof as well as corresponding test 

regions of the printed product, reflectance values 
are photoelectrically sensed, from which surface 

covering values for the printed inks are determined, 
for which for the printing ink black the reflectance 

is sensed in the near infra-red, and the control 
commands for the ink feeding elements of the 

printing press are determined by a comparison of the 
corresponding surface covering values of master and 

printed product characterised in that for the 
printing ink black the infra-red colour density DIR 

is determined from which via an empirically 
determined relationship the optically effective 

colour surface value EFF(K) for the printing ink 
black is determined, that the reflectance from the 

test regions are calculated to standard colour 
values X(CMYK), Y(CMYK), Z(CMYK), that from the 

standard colour values X(CMYK), Y(CMYK), Z(CMYK) of 
the four colour superimposed print by a linear 

transformation the following standard colour values 
are calculated: 


X(CMY) = ax(1) · X(CMYK) + ax(2), 
Y(CMY) = ay(1) · Y(CMYK) + ay(2) and 
Z(CMY) = az(1) · Z(CMYK) + az(2). 
 
Wherein these standard colour values X(CMY), Y(CMY), 

Z(CMY) correspond to a colour locus which arises by 
the combined printing of only the three coloured 

inks, and wherein the coefficients ax(1), ax(2), 
ay(1), ay(2), az(1), az(2) are determined 

empirically as a function of the infra-red ink  
 

density DIR and that from the standard colour values 
X(CMY), Y(CMY), Z(CMY) obtained in this way the 

optically effective colour surface covering values 
EFF(C), EFF(M), EFF(Y) of the three coloured inks 

are determined. 
Process according to claim 1 characterised in that 
for determining the values of the effective colour 

areas EFF(C), EFF(M), EFF(Y) for the three coloured 
inks C, M, Y the Neugebauer equations are used 

wherein the theoretically calculated standard colour 
values X(CMY), Y(CMY), Z(CMY) are used and for the 

standard colour values to be substituted into the 
Neugebauer equation the individual colour and also 

superimposed print combination standard colour 
values are used which have been determined in print 

tests on raster areas. 
Process of according to claim 1 or 2 characterized 
in that the process is repeated sufficiently until 

the colour deviations lie within a predetermined 
tolerance range.
