<ABSTRACT>
Laser-addressable thermal transfer donor 
elements for producing color proofs, printing plates, 

films, printed circuit boards, and other media are 
disclosed. The thermal transfer donor elements include 

a substrate with a gas-producing polymer layer thereon, 
and an array of discrete nanostructured elements 

embedded within the gas-producing polymer layer. The 
gas-producing polymer layer has a thermally available 

nitrogen content of greater than about 10 weight 
percent. Each of the nanostructured elements includes 

an elongated structure conformally coated with a 
radiation absorbing material. A thermal mass transfer 

material (e.g., a metal or colorant such as a dye or 
pigment) is included in or over the gas-producing 

polymer layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermally 
imageable materials for the production of printed 
circuit boards as well as color proofs, printing 
plates, films, and other graphic arts media using 
thermal transfer imaging methods. More particularly, 
the invention relates to thermal transfer donor 
elements having a gas-producing polymer with radiation 
absorbing nanostructured elements therein. The phenomenon of laser-induced ablation 
transfer imaging is generically known and is believed 
to entail both complex non-equilibrium physical and 
chemical mechanisms. Such laser-induced ablation 
transfer is thought to be effected by the rapid and 
transient accumulation of pressure beneath and/or 
within a mass transfer layer initiated by imagewise 
irradiation. Transient pressure accumulation can be 
attributed to one or more of the following factors: 
rapid gas formation via chemical decomposition and/or 
rapid heating of trapped gases, evaporation, photo 
expansion, thermal expansion, ionization and/or by 
propagation of a pressure-wave. The force produced by 
the release of such pressure is sufficient to cause 
transfer of the imaging layer to an adjacent receptor 
element. The force is preferably sufficient to effect 
the complete transfer of the exposed area of a layer 
rather than the partial or selective transfer of 
components thereof. Laser-induced thermal mass transfer of 
materials from a donor sheet to a receptor layer has 
been described in the patent and technical literature  
 
for nearly thirty years. However, few commercial 
systems have utilized this technology. Exposure 
fluences required to transfer materials to a receptor 
have been, at best, on the order of 0.1 Joule/cm² (i.e., 
J/cm²). Consequently, lasers capable of emitting more 
than 5 Watts of power, typically water-cooled Nd:YAG 
lasers, have been required to produce large format 
images (A3 or larger) in reasonable times. These 
lasers are expensive and impractical for many 
applications. More recently, single-mode laser diodes 
and diode-pumped lasers producing 0.1-4 Watts in the 
near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum 
have become commercially available. Diode-pumped 
Nd:YAG lasers are good examples of this type of source. 
They are compact, efficient, and relatively 
inexpensive. In order to use these new sources in a 
single-beam, large format imaging system, the exposure 
fluence of thermal transfer materials should be reduced 
to less than 0.04 J/cm² and the exposure pixel dwell 
time should be less than 300
