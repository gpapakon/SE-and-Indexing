<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to thermal insulation (3) for internal areas of combustion installations and gas turbines (1). The thermal insulation used for this is exposed to the destructive effects of the hot gases of these installations. The thermal insulation (3) according to the invention is provided with protection (5) in the area of its surfaces (3S) which are in contact with the hot gases. This protection (5) is formed by rod- or plate-shaped reinforcing elements (1) which are partly or fully integrated in the surface (3S).

Thermal insulation (3) consisting of a fibre
composite (3V) for the inner regions (4), through which

hot gases flow, of combustion plants (1) and gas
turbines (1), characterized in that the surface (3S) of

the insulation (3) is provided with a protection (5) in
the form of bar- or plate-shaped reinforcing elements

(5) which are manufactured from zirconium dioxide,
Al
2
O
3
, mullite, magnesium oxide or a spinel, in that the
reinforcing elements (5) are integrated partially or

completely into the fibre composite (3V) and those ends
of the reinforcing elements (5) which are arranged in

the fibre composite (3V) are provided with additional
anchoring (5A), and in that the longitudinal axes of

the bar-shaped reinforcing elements (5) are oriented
perpendicularly to the surface (3S) of the fibre

composite (3V) whilst the surfaces of the plate-shaped
reinforcing elements (5) form an angle of between 10°

and 70° with the surface (3S) of the fibre composite
(3V).
Thermal insulation according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the reinforcing elements (5) are

arranged in rows, and the reinforcing elements (5) of
one row are arranged offset relative to the reinforcing

elements (5) of the two directly adjacent rows.
Thermal insulation according to one of Claims
1 or 2, characterized in that the smallest spacing

between two bar-shaped reinforcing elements (5) of a
row is equal to the diameter of the reinforcing

elements (5), and in that the spacing between two
adjacent rows of bar-shaped reinforcing elements (5)

likewise corresponds to the diameter of a bar-shaped
reinforcing element (5).
Thermal insulation according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the bar-shaped

reinforcing elements (5) are provided, at their end
facing the hot gas, with a head (5K) which is made

round or rectangular.
Method for the protection of thermal 
insulation (3) consisting of a fibre composite (3V) for

the inner regions (4), through which hot gases flow at
an onflow angle Ω, of combustion plants (1) and gas

turbines (1), characterized in that the surface (3S) of
the insulation (3) is provided with protection (5) in

the form of bar-shaped reinforcing elements (5)
consisting of zirconium dioxide, Al
2
O
3
, mullite,
magnesium oxide or a spinel, which are integrated

partially or completely into the fibre composite (3V)
and of which the ends arranged in the fibre composite

(3V) are provided with additional anchoring (5A), and
in that the longitudinal axes of the bar-shaped

reinforcing elements (5) are oriented perpendicularly
to the surface (3S) of the fibre composite (3V), and

the distance between the bar-shaped reinforcing
elements (5) is made the smaller, the larger the onflow

angle Ω of the hot gas is.
