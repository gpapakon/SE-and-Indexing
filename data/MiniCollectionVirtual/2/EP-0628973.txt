<ABSTRACT>
This support has the general shape of a comb, including, in a vertical plane, two parallel identical small plates (3) spaced apart and each provided with several parallel vertical grooves (7), which are open upwards and distributed over the entire length of the small plate, defining between them areas in the form of teeth (9), and each intended to receive an electrical conductor transversely. In the space (5) separating the two small plates (3) is arranged a flat slide (15) which is provided with several teeth (20) separated by recesses having a bottom located at the same level as the bottom of the grooves, and which can move horizontally between a rest position in which it allows the conductor to be inserted into the corresponding groove (7) and a clamping position in which each of its teeth (20) forms, with each of the teeth (9) associated with the small plates, an area for clamping the conductor, this area varying as a function of the cross-section of the conductor used.
