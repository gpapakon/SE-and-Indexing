<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for shearing elongated products such as 
rods, bars and the like moving longitudinally along a path 

of travel (Pt). The apparatus includes a pair of 
constant diameter helical blades (44) mounted for rotation 

about axes parallel to the path of travel. The 
rotational orientation of the blades and the spacing 

between their respective axes is such that segments of the 
blades coact along a cutting path (Pc) parallel to the 

path of travel. The blades are rotated in opposite 
directions to thereby cause coacting segments thereof to 

move repetitively along the cutting path in the direction 
of product movement. A switch (56) diverts the products 

from the path of travel across the cutting path for 
shearing by the coacting segments of the cutting blades.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to continuous hot rolling mills of the type producing 
rods, bars and the like, and is concerned in particular with an improved shear for trimming the 
front and back ends from hot rolled rods being delivered from the finishing stands of high speed 
rod mills. Conventionally, the front and back ends of hot rolled rods are trimmed by shears located 
along the rolling line in advance of the finishing stands, where the product is moving at slower 
speeds. Some trimming shears operate intermittently, whereas others operate continuously. 
Intermittently operable shears necessarily require complex control systems which precisely 
position the shear blades during each cut in response to rod end position signals generated by 
sensors located along the rolling line. From the standpoint of control complexity, continuously 
operating shears such as disc shears are far less demanding, but they commonly produce sharply 
oblique cuts with undesirable jagged ends. In any event, none of the conventional disc shears has been deemed capable of operating 
safely and reliably at delivery speeds on the order of 90 m/sec. and higher. Thus, the front and 
back ends of finish rolled rods must be trimmed manually after the laying head, either while the 
product is being conveyed n overlapping ring form on the cooling conveyor, or after the cooled 
rings have been gathered into a coil at the reforming station. Manual trimming is labor 
intensive, often inconvenient, and potentially hazardous to operating personnel.  An objective of the present invention is the provision of an improved shear for trimming 
the front and back ends from rods emanating at high speed from the finishing stands of rod 
mills. A related objective of the present invention is the provision of a continually operating 
shear which inherently makes a single cut in response to diversion of the product from its normal 
path of travel, and which does not require a rod end position signal to coordinate actuation of 
the shear blades. Still another objective of the present invention is the provision of a continually operating 
shear which severs the product cleanly and at an angle which avoids undesirable sharp or jagged 
ends. In a preferred embodiment of the invention to be described hereinafter in greater detail, 
these and other objects and advantages are achieved by the provision of a shear having a pair 
of constant diameter helical blades mounted for contra-rotation about axes parallel to the path 
of product travel. The

Apparatus for shearing elongated products such 
as rods, bars and the like moving longitudinally along a 

path of travel, said apparatus comprising: 
   a pair of constant diameter helical blades (44) 

mounted for rotation about axes parallel to said path of 
travel (Pt), the rotational orientation of said blades and 

the spacing between said axes being such that segments of 
said blades coact along a cutting path (Pc), parallel to 

the path of travel; 
   means for rotating said blades in opposite directions 

to thereby cause the coacting segments thereof to move 
repetitively along said cutting path in the direction of 

movement of said products along said path of travel; and 
   switch means (56) for diverting said products from 

said path of travel across said cutting path for shearing 
by the coacting segments of said cutting blades. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
helical blades are carried respectively on rotatable 

cylindrical drums (34). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein each 
helical blade circumscribes at least one turn about the 

circumference of its respective drum. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein each of 
said cutting blades has a helix angle of between 45°-60°. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
axial length of each of said blades is equal to the 

circumference of the circular path circumscribed by the 
rotation thereof. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 further 
comprising guide means defining upper and lower guide 

paths extending in parallel relationship with said cutting 
path, said switch means being operable during a cutting 

cycle to divert said product from said lower guide path 
across said cutting path and into said upper guide path. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 wherein said 
upper and lower guide paths are defined respectively by 

downwardly and upwardly facing grooves in stationary guide 
elements. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 further 
comprising means for opening and closing said grooves to 

accommodate exit and entry of products during a cutting 
cycle. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 wherein said 
means for opening and closing said grooves comprises 

slotted guide pipes lining said grooves, and means for 
rotating said guide pipes between open positions at which 

their slots accommodate entry and exit of products from 
the respective guide grooves, and closed positions at 

which said pipes confine products in the respective guide 
 

grooves.

longitudinally along a path of travel, said system 

comprising:
