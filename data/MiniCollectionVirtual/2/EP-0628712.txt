<ABSTRACT>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine of a 
motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12) having 

an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38) extending 
therethrough and an outer wall (40), the bore having a 

longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14) extending across 
the bore and having a longitudinal axis (Y) 

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 
of the bore, the shaft being rotatably mounted in the 

inner wall of the throttle body for pivotal movement 
about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, at least one 

end (42) of the shaft passing through the inner wall 
to extend beyond the outer wall; a flap valve (16) 

secured to the shaft inside the bore for movement 
between a fully open position and a substantially 

closed position on rotation of the shaft; a lever arm 
(18) secured to the said at least one end of the shaft 

adjacent the outer wall; and a throttle linkage (20) 
pivotally connected to one end of the lever arm and 

pivotally connected to the outer wall of the throttle 
body at one or the other of two positions (130,132) 

which are diametrically opposed relative to the 
longitudinal axis of the shaft and substantially 

equidistantly spaced therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a throttle
mechanism for an engine of a motor vehicle.There are numerous designs of throttle
mechanisms for engines which are well known to those
skilled in the art. These known throttle mechanisms
basically comprise a throttle body with a bore
therethrough, a shaft extending across the bore and
having a flap valve secured thereto, and means for
rotating the shaft relative to the throttle body.
Generally, the problem associated with these known
designs is that for each design of engine, and/or for
each application of the throttle mechanism, a
different design of throttle mechanism is required in
terms of the layout of the throttle mechanism and/or
the layout of the elements attached to, or forming
part of, the throttle mechanism. EP-A-0220572
discloses a throttle mechanism in accordance with the
preamble of Claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of these disadvantages.A throttle mechanism in accordance with the
present invention is characterised over EP-A-0220572
by the features specified in the characterising
portion of Claim 1. This arrangement is such that the
positioning and orientation of the throttle linkage
relative to the throttle body, and hence relative to
the engine, can easily be adjusted to meet the
requirements of a layout for the throttle mechanism
relative to the engine.The present invention will now be described,
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a plan view of a throttle
mechanism in accordance with the present invention;Figure 2 is an end view of a manifold to
which the throttle mechanism of Figure 1 can be
attached;Figure 3 is a plan view of an air horn which
is attached to the throttle mechanism of Figure 1;Figure 4 is a side view in the direction of
arrow IV in Figure 1 showing the attachment of the
throttle position sensor and the idle air control
valve motor but with other features omitted for
clarity;Figure 5 is a side view in the direction of
arrow V in Figure 1 showing the fluid heating means
and the air horn positioned on the throttle body but
with other features omitted for clarity;Figure 6 is a side view in the direction of
arrow VI in Figure 1 showing the throttle linkage and
idle adjust means but with other features omitted for
clarity; Figure 7 is a view similar to that of Figure
6 with the positions of the throttle linkage and idle
adjust means reversed;Figure 8 is a cross-sectional view of the
idle adjust means of Figure 1; andFigure 9 is an alternative

<CLAIMS>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine
of a motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12)

having an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38)
extending therethrough and an outer wall (40), the

bore having a longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14)
extending across the bore and having a longitudinal

axis (Y) substantially perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the bore, the shaft being

rotatably mounted in the inner wall of the throttle
body for pivotal movement about the longitudinal axis

of the shaft, at least one end (42) of the shaft
passing through the inner wall to extend beyond the

outer wall; a flap valve (16) secured to the shaft
inside the bore for movement between a fully open

position and a substantially closed position on
rotation of the shaft; a lever arm (18) secured to the

said at least one end of the shaft adjacent the outer
wall; a throttle linkage (20) pivotally connected to

one end (122) of the lever arm; and connecting means
(134) at a first postion (130) on the outer wall of

the throttle body; characterised by substantially
identical connecting means (136) at a second postion

(132) on the outer wall of the throttle body, the
first and second postions being diametrically opposed

relative to the longitudinal axis of the shaft and
substantially equidistantly spaced therefrom; and in

that the throttle linkage (20) is pivotally connected
to one or the other of the two connecting means.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
1, wherein the throttle linkage (20) comprises first

and second arms (118,120), the first arm being
pivotally connected at one end to the said one end

(122) of the lever arm (18) and being pivotally
connected at the other end to a point intermediate the 

ends (124,126) of the second arm, the second arm being
pivotally connected at one end to the one or the other

of said two connecting means (134,136) and being
connectable at the other end to a throttle cable.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
2, wherein the second arm (120) is substantially

L-shaped.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
1, wherein the throttle linkage (20') comprises first

and second arms (118,120'), the first arm being
pivotally connected at one end to the said one end

(122) of the lever arm (18), the second arm being
pivotally connected at one end (124') to the one or

the other of said two connecting means (134,136),
being connected at the other end to the other end of

the first arm, and being connectable intermediate
(128') its ends to a throttle cable.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in any
one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the throttle linkage

(20) is pivotally connected to the outer wall (40) by
a screw (138) having a threaded shank, and wherein the

connecting means at said first and second positions
(130,132) each comprise a threaded bore (134,136)

formed in the outer wall into which the screw can be
threaded.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in any
one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the throttle linkage

(20') is pivotally connected to the outer wall (40) by
a r
od (160) which is attached to the outer wall at one
or the other of the first and second positions

(130,132) and by means (162) pivotally fastening the
throttle linkage to the rod.
