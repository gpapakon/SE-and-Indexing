<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided which allow 
sounds emanated by objects in a viewer-interactive, 

computer-generated graphic virtual world, and other 
virtual world sounds (e.g., a music score), to be 

reproduced using flexibly and automatically scheduled 
resources of a virtual world sound system. Sound 

system resources are allocated in accordance with 
priority values associated with sounds, sound-emanating 

objects or requests for sound channel allocation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and system 
for reproducing sounds in an interactive virtual world 
environment. "Virtual reality" is the experience of living 
or playing in a computer-generated environment which 
models a three-dimensional ("3-D") virtual space (i.e., 
a virtual world). In virtual reality systems, a viewer 
typically dons a set of goggle-mounted video screens or 
some other form of head-mounted display ("HMD"), and an 
audio headset, to block out the real world. Typically, 
the HMD is a conventional pixel (picture element) 
based, raster scan video display device. The viewer 
might also be provided with a simulated laser gun, a 
vehicle with accelerator and brake pedals, or some 
other device coupled to the computer system to enable 
the viewer to move about in, interact with or otherwise 
influence objects and characters in the virtual world. 
Sounds emanating from the virtual world (such as lasers 
firing or vehicles accelerating) are reproduced by 
speakers in the viewer's headset or by external 
speakers. On the HMD the viewer sees images of virtual 
world scenes that are generated from a 3-D model of the  
 
virtual world by a computer graphic system. The scenes 
are displayed to the viewer as they appear from a 
specific position and orientation in the virtual world, 
called the "viewpoint" or "eyepoint." Usually, the 
viewer is given some degree of control over the 
position and orientation of the viewpoint, thus 
allowing the viewer to see different images from a 
plurality of different viewpoints. By enabling the viewer to change the position 
and/or orientation of his or her viewpoint, the 
computer graphic system can create the illusion of the 
viewer "travelling" through the virtual world and 
looking in-all directions. Depending on the 
capabilities and programming of the system, the viewer 
might be allowed to "travel" without restriction above, 
below and around a scene, as well as into or through 
structures, as though the viewer could fly or had other 
capabilities. The system might also be designed to 
constrain the motion of the viewpoint in various ways 
to achieve realism. For example, the viewer might only 
be allowed to position and orient the viewpoint no 
closer than six feet from the ground to simulate a view 
of the virtual world from the vantage of a person 
standing on the ground in the world. Alternatively or 
in addition, the viewpoint might be constrained from 
passing through the image of a solid surface (such as 
the wall of a building) -- just as
