<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an automatic docking system for a 
portable computer which docks with a docking station. The 

approach of the computer to the station is detected, and docking 
is temporarily prevented, while automated equipment (such as a 

program run on the processor of the computer) protects data 
within the computer, and takes other necessary steps. Then, 

docking is allowed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns docking stations for portable 
computers. Specifically, the invention concerns apparatus which 
automatically suspends operation of the computer, and other 
components, during docking. Portable computers, such as laptop and notebook computers, 
are designed to be small in size and light in weight. These 
computers eliminate heavy, bulky accessories, such as cathode-ray-tube 
monitors, large disc drives, large tape drives, and 
full-size keyboards. Many of these portable computers maintain the ability to be 
re-connected to these accessories. However, making and breaking 
connections to accessories requires a significant amount of time 
and manipulation, particularly if the number of accessories is 
large. To alleviate these problems, "docking stations" have been 
developed. A docking station is a stationary device which stands 
connected to multiple accessories. In addition, docking stations 
frequently include facilities for accepting expansion cards, and 
for connecting the expansion cards to the internal busses of the 
portable computer. The user connects the portable computer to 
the docking station, in a single, easy maneuver. When connected, 
the portable computer acquires the capabilities of a larger, 
desktop machine. To connect a portable computer with the docking station, the 
user typically first terminates power to both the computer and 
the docking station, and then slides the computer into a chute, 
or along rails, until connectors on the computer make connection 
with corresponding connectors on the docking station. A primary reason for terminating power is the potential  
 
hazard (to data) in making connections between powered electronic 
components. One data hazard is that, if the computer is running, some of 
the lines on the internal bus will be in a logic HIGH state (eg, 
above 2.0 volts for TTL). When one of these lines connects to a 
mating line, in a docking station, there is no assurance that the 
mating line will be in the same logic state, nor, if in the same 
state, at the same voltage. When connectors at different voltages make contact, 
intermittent electrical arcing occurs during the contacting 
process. (This type of arcing occurs in electrical switches, and 
is called contact bounce.) The arcing acts as a short circuit 
between the two lines. The result is that a random number of 
ONEs and ZEROs are applied to the line carrying the lower 
voltage. This random sequence, occurring on multiple lines, can be 
interpreted as data, or commands, and can

<CLAIMS>
A portable computer characterized in that the computer 
comprises control means for modifying the operation of the 

computer in response to a signal indicative that docking of the 
portable computer with a docking station is to take place. 
A portable computer according to claim 1, characterized 
by a detector (A,B,P1,P2,36,39) which detects the presence of a 

docking station, and issues a signal in response thereto which 
activates the control means. 
A portable computer according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the control means causes a processor within 

the computer to become idle during docking. 
A portable computer according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized by means for suspending a clock in the computer in 

response to the signal produced by the detector. 
A portable computer according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by means (S',B,R') which prevent 

the connection of the computer to the docking station before the 
control means has modified the operation of the computer for 

docking. 
A docking station for a portable computer, comprising 
one or more accessories which connect with the computer when the 

computer is docked in the station, characterized in that the 
docking station further comprises a detector (A,B,P1,P2,36,39) 

 
for detecting the approach of the computer and producing an 

approach signal in response thereto, and an initialization system 
for applying a predetermined sequence of signals to the one or 

more accessories, in response to the approach signal, to modify 
the operation of the one or more accessories for connection to 

the computer prior to docking. 
A docking station according to claim 6, characterized by 
a processor which can communicate with the one or more 

accessories connected thereto, and a memory means accessible by 
the processor. 
A docking station according to claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterized by means which prevent the connection of a portable 

computer to the docking station before the operation of the one 

or more accessories has been modified. 
A method of docking a portable computer with a docking 
station connected to one or more accessories, characterized by 

actuating a detector (A,B,P1,P2,36,39) within the computer or 
docking station by moving the computer with respect to the 

docking station, the detector thereupon producing a signal which 
instructs the portable computer or docking station to protect 

data within the computer, docking station or one or more 
accessories from disruption caused by docking. 
A method according to claim 10, characterized by 
further including temporarily preventing docking until data 

within the computer, the docking station or the one or more 
accessories has been protected.
