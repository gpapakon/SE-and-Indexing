<ABSTRACT>
A CMOS circuit (2, 28, 56, 82, 136, 146, 158, 166) in which the 
threshold voltage of at least one MOS transistor of the CMOS circuit is 

altered is disclosed. By altering the threshold voltage the speed/power 
dissipation tradeoff can be modified to match the design criteria of a 

particular CMOS circuit. For example, to increase the pull-up speed of the 
PMOS transistor (4) in the CMOS transistor pair (4, 6) of a CMOS circuit 

(2), the threshold voltage of selective MOS transistors is lowered. The 
altering can occur on a device level or a circuit level. A method for 

designing such CMOS logic circuits is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application is related to our copending 
British application GB-A-2272588, the disclosure of which is hereby 
incorporated by reference. The present invention relates to a CMOS integrated circuit and to a 
method of producing a CMOS circuit, for example a circuit which can adapt 
its speed/power dissipation tradeoff to design conditions. In recent years complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) 
technology has been widely used for VLSI design. The advantage of CMOS 
technology is that it has very low power dissipation in comparison with other 
technologies such as bipolar devices. The disadvantage of CMOS technology 
is that its performance is slow compared to bipolar devices. As a result of this disadvantage of CMOS technology, BiCMOS 
technology was developed. BiCMOS technology largely retains the low 
power dissipation of CMOS technology, yet performs with the high speed of 
bipolar devices. However, the BiCMOS solution is considerably more 
complex to fabricate because of the presence of the bipolar devices. Another problem of BiCMOS technology is that the scalability of this 
technology at supply voltages of 2 volts or less is a problem. Today, supply 
voltages of 5 volts and 3.3 volts are most common, but it is thought that the 
supply voltage could eventually drop to about 1 volt. Hence, the high speed 
and relatively low power dissipation of BiCMOS is not likely to be available 
for supply voltages below 2 volts. One attempted solution to the scalability 
problem of BiCMOS is found in U.S. Patent 5,132,567 which discloses a 
BiCMOS NAND circuit that apparently provides improved scalability by 
employing low threshold n-channel FET transistors in conjunction with  
 
standard threshold n and p channel FET transistors. The resulting BiCMOS 
NAND circuit is even more complex to fabricate than conventional BiCMOS. It is known that higher drive current and faster performance can be 
obtained by making the cell size of MOS transistors on an integrated circuit 
larger. However, although increasing the cell size improves switching 
performance of the given cell, it also undesirabiliy increases the input gate 
capacitance of the cell which slows the driving of this cell, and requires 
additional die area which limits chip density. Conventionally, in the design of integrated circuits, the threshold 
voltages of the MOS transistors are intentionally made the same magnitude. A threshold voltage is the voltage required to put the transistor in a 
conductive state. It is
