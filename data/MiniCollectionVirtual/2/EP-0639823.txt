<ABSTRACT>
When data of EEPROM storing 
set data such as interlocking data representing 

the interlocking relation between 
a fire sensor and an appliance to be controlled, 

correspondence data between the 
address of each terminal and an installation 

position of each terminal, display 
data displayed at a display portion of 

a fire receiver, reception function data 
representing the functions of the fire receiver, 

etc, are updated, the fire receiver 
of the present invention uses a memory 

pack which consists of an IC card, etc, 
and can be removably connected to the 

fire receiver, connects the memory pack 
storing data for updating the data to the 

receiver and reads the data and writes it 
to the EEPROM. Further, the set data before 

updating, that are stored in the EEPROM, 
are read into the memory pack, 

and this memory pack is carried to a service 
center, etc, so that set data for updating 

can be generated in consideration of 
the set data before updating, and are similarly 

written into the EEPROM through 
the memory pack. In this way, even those 

who have no knowledge on the ROM, 
that is, electronic circuits, can appropriately 

update the set data. Moreover, the 
updating operation is easy. The present 

invention provides such a fire alarm receiver 
and a fire alarm system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fire protection
receiver and a fire protection receiver system including the
fire protection receiver, which provide the functions of a
central processing unit mainly controlling terminals and
displaying information, conditions, etc., in fire protection
equipment primarily composed of a fire detector, a controlled
apparatus composed of, for example, a smoke controller, the
actuation thereof being interlocked with the fire detector, and
a transmitter connected to the foregoing component units.FIG. 8 is a conceptual view showing an example of a
fire protection receiver in conventional fire protection
equipment.The example of the conventional equipment has a
display unit 30 showing fire information, operation statuses,
etc., a control unit 40 composed of switches and the like, and a
printer 50 on the front surface of a receiver R. Provided
inside the receiver R are mainly a CPU (not shown), which
controls the receiver R, and a ROM (read-only memory) 70,
wherein preset data is stored.When installing fire protection equipment at a site
such as in a building, data showing the correspondence between
the addresses of terminals, including fire detectors and smoke
controllers, and the places, where the terminals are installed 
(e.g., conference rooms, office rooms, and an entrance hall), is
stored beforehand in the ROM 70 of the receiver R according to
the situations of the site, the data showing such correspondence
being used for display at the time of regular inspection or in
case a fire alarm is given. Further, interlock data showing the
interlock relationship between fire detectors and controlled
equipment (data showing which controlled equipment should be
actuated when a certain detector is actuated) and display data
to be indicated on the display unit of the receiver R are also
stored in advance in the ROM 70 when fire protection equipment
is installed at a site.If, however, a partition change or the like takes
place after installing the fire protection equipment at a
building or the like, and if, for example, an office room is
changed to a guest room, then the correspondence between the
fire detectors and the installation places changes. This
requires updating the set data, which has been stored in the ROM
70.To update the set data stored in the ROM 70, the ROM
70, which is an IC package having an IC chip sealed with resin,
for example, is removed from a ROM socket, which is soldered to
a substrate, then a new ROM 70a (a ROM storing updated set data)
is attached to the
