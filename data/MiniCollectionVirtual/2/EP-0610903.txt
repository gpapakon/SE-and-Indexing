<ABSTRACT>
The TV signal transmission system has a PAL-plus encoder (1) and a PAL encoder (2). Located in the path of the PAL-plus encoder is a unit (3) that adds in status bits and identification signals. The output signals are received by a switching unit (4) that allow either the PAL plus or standard PAL format signals to be transmitted. The identification signal component of the PAL plus transmission is in the form of an additional burst signal. The signals are received at the TV receiver unit and identification is provided by a built in circuit.

<CLAIMS>
A colour television system comprising a transmitter 
for coding and receiver for decoding colour television 

signals, wherein at the receiving end in accordance with a 
control signal either decoding according to the colour-plus 

process or decoding using comb- or notch filters takes 
place, characterised in that 


in the transmitter a code signal is inserted into the 
active part of a line of the colour television signal 

not visible on the screen and 
for the determination of the control signal in the 
receiver the time-base fluctuations of the code signal 

are determined. 
A colour television system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the code signal is a burst signal 

(B2) with the colour auxiliary carrier frequency. 
A colour television system according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that in the receiver a comparison between 

the burst signal (B2) and the burst signal (B2) delayed by 
a specified time period takes place and that the control 

signal is determined from the comparison result. 
A colour television system according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that by a suitable selection of the phase 

position of the burst signal (B2) compared to the burst 
signal (B1) present in the horizontal blanking interval of 

the colour television signal, further data relating to the 
transmitter-end signal processing are transmitted from the 

transmitter to the receiver and these further data are 
transparent in respect of a recording/playback process. 
A transmitter for coding colour television signals in 
a colour television system according to one or more of 

Claims 1 - 4 which comprises means (3) for inserting a  
 

burst signal (B2) with the colour auxiliary carrier 
frequency into the active part of a line of the colour 

television signal not visible on the screen, characterised 
in that the burst signal (B2) remains coupled to the 

synchronising signal of the colour television signal 
according to the standard. 
A transmitter according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that by a suitable selection of its phase position compared 

to the burst signal (B1) present in the horizontal blanking 
interval of the colour television signal, the burst signal 

(B2) contains further data relating to the transmitter-end 
signal processing. 
A receiver for decoding colour television signals in a 
colour television system according to one or more of Claims 

1 - 4, characterised in that it comprises: 

a gate circuit (13) which transmits the code signal 
present in the active part of a line of the colour 

television signal not visible on the screen and 
a circuit (14, 15, 16, 17, 18) for detecting the time-base 
fluctuations of the code signal, at whose output 

the control signal is available. 
A receiver according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
it comprises a gate control circuit (19, 20, 21, 22) which 

generates a gate control signal using the synchronising 
signals separated from the colour television signal and at 

least one status bit transmitted together with the colour 
television signal. 
A receiver according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the gate control circuit comprises a counting circuit (20) 

which is supplied with the synchronising signals separated 
from the colour television signal.  

 
A receiver according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the gate control circuit comprises a status bit decoder 

(21) which supplies output signals from the counting 
circuit (20) and from the status bit decoder (21) to a 

logic gate (22) and the gate control signal is made 
available at the output of the logic gate (22). 
A receiver according to one or more of Claims 7 - 10, 
characterised in that the circuit for detecting the time-base 

fluctuations of the code signal comprises a delay 
component (14) for delaying the code signal by a defined 

time interval, an adder (15) for adding delayed and 
undelayed code signal, a rectifier (16) connected to the 

output of the adder, a low-pass filter (17) connected to 
the output of the rectifier, and a threshold value circuit 

(18) which is connected to the output of the low-pass 
filter and at whose output the control signal is available. 
A receiver according to one or more of Claims 7 - 11, 
characterised in that it comprises means for detecting the 

phase position of the burst signal (B2) compared to the 
burst signal (B1) present in the horizontal blanking 

interval of the colour television signal.
