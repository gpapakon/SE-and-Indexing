<ABSTRACT>
The present retaining element serves for the releasable fastening of skirting boards (9) on walls (10). It comprises a wall plate (1), which can be screwed pivotably on the wall (10), and a vertical leg (4) which projects at right angles from the wall plate (1). Said leg (4) has a cutout (5) which is open towards the border of the leg (4), widens somewhat as it becomes deeper and in which a resilient clamp (6) with two resiliently compressible legs (11) can be latched. In order to ensure particularly good abutment of the skirting board (9) on the floor (17), the wall plate (1) is provided with a supporting leg (7) which is integrally formed on approximately at right angles beneath the screw hole (2) and exhibits a supporting lug (8) which bears resiliently on the floor (17).
