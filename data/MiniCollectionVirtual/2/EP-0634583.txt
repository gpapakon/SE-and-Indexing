<ABSTRACT>
Nuts have a tendency to work loose from their 
tightened condition on bolts due to vibration, the effect 

of which appears to be aggravated by heating. Means for 
effectively locking a nut (22, 40 or 60) on a bolt (10, 42 

or 50) comprise an inwardly tapered axial hole (18 or 54) 
in the threaded end of the bolt, two diametrical slits (20 

or 56) at right angles to each other in the threaded end 
of the bolt which slits extend only partway along the 

threaded zone (16 or 52) of the bolt, and a tapered pin 
(28 or 64) adapted to be driven into the hole to expand 

the slit portion of the threaded zone of the bolt. When in 
the tightened condition, the threaded end of the bolt 

projects from the nut for a distance of several thread 
pitches so that the pin not only takes up radial clearance 

between the nut and the bolt, but also enlarges the 
projecting end of the bolt to a diameter slightly larger 

than the internal diameter of the nut so that any risk of 
the nut becoming dangerously slack or lost is obviated. 

The important use proposed for this invention is for the 
wheel nuts of lorries.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to means for locking a nut on 
a bolt. The word "bolt" is herein intended to include any 
male-threaded member such as a stud or end of a shaft. The invention is useful in all cases where nuts are 
liable to become loosened by vibration, and is 
particularly but by no means exclusively beneficial in the 
case of wheel nuts for lorries. In spite of being 
tightened to very high torque values of the order of 500 
pound feet (610 newton metres), lorry wheel nuts tend to 
work loose with potentially disastrous consequences and 
thus require very frequent checking. It is beleived that 
axial expansion of the associated bolts due to heating of 
the wheels caused by long periods of running, especially 
at speed on motorways, enables the vibrations constantly 
experienced during running to loosen the nuts more easily. 
However, similar problems occur in many other 
applications, for example in the case of drums used in 
paper-making. Locking means such as split pins and tab 
washers are well known but are not always reliable in 
practice. The object of this invention is to provide means for 
effectively locking a nut on a bolt. According to the invention, means for locking a nut 
having an internally screw-threaded zone on a bolt having 
an externally screw-threaded zone are characterised by an  
 
inwardly tapered axial hole in the threaded end of the 
bolt, at least one radial slit in said end extending only 
partway along the threaded zone of the bolt, and a tapered 
pin adapted to be driven into said hole to expand the slit 
portion of the threaded zone of the bolt. Preferably, the pin has a slightly steeper taper than 
the hole. When the nut and the bolt are tightened in operative 
position, the threaded end of said bolt preferably 
projects from said nut for a distance of several thread 
pitches. Preferably, the axial length of the or each slit is 
substantially equal to the diameter of the bolt plus the 
distance said bolt projects from the nut. Preferably, also, the effective length of the pin is 
substantially the same as the axial length of the or each 
slit, and the axial length of the hole is greater than the 
effective length of said pin. Preferably, the pin has an externally threaded head 
upon which a supplementary nut can be screwed to withdraw 
the pin from the hole. Preferably, also, the threaded end of the bolt has 
two diametrical slits at right angles to each other. Preferably, the nut is elongated so as to be 
significantly longer than the diameter of the bolt.

Means for locking a nut (22,40 or 60) having an 
internally screw-threaded zone (24) on a bolt (10, 42 or 

50) having an externally screw-threaded zone (16 or 52) 
characterised by an inwardly tapered axial hole (18 or 54) 

in the threaded end of the bolt (10, 42 or 50), at least 
one radial slit (20 or 56) in said end extending only 

partway along the threaded zone (16 or 52) of the bolt 
(10, 42 or 50), and a tapered pin (28 or 64) adapted to be 

driven into said hole to expand the slit portion of the 
threaded zone (16 or 52) of the bolt (10, 42 or 50). 
Means according to claim 1, further characterised in

Means according to either of the preceding claims, 
further characterised in that when the nut (22, 40 or 60)
