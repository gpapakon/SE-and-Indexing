<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for use in an ink-jet 
printer (10) having a printhead (26
a
) and an opposing platen (18
a
) capable of 
movement toward and away from the printer's printhead (26
a
) to define a record 
media gap therebetween. The system is effective to selectively restrict movement 

of a printer's platen (18
a
) to effect adjustment of the record media gap upon 
detection of record media (20
a
, 20
b
, 20
c
) having a characteristic which warrants 
such a change. The system is provided with a detector (24) capable of 

recognizing the characteristic, and with a stop mechanism (44) which acts in 
concert with the detector (24) to effect the desired change. In its nominal 

configuration, the stop mechanism (44) limits movement of the platen (18
a
) at a 
first position so as to define a first record media gap. However, upon detection 

of record media (20
a
, 20
b
, 20
c
) having the characteristic, the stop mechanism (44) 
is automatically reconfigured so as to allow movement of the platen (18
a
) to a 
second position defining a second record media gap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to printers and, more
particularly, to an ink-jet printer employing a system which automatically adjusts
the distance between the printer's platen and printhead. Toward this end, the
system utilizes a stop mechanism which effects controlled positioning of the platen
based on detected characteristics of the record media to be printed on.In a conventional ink-jet printer, ink is deposited on record media
via a traveling printhead which propels ink drops onto the record media as it
passes thereacross. The record media is spaced from the printhead, the upper
surface of the record media being held at a predetermined minimum distance
from the printhead (Dm). Most printers set distance (Dm) using a platen which
supports the record media, the platen generally being held in a fixed position
relative to the printer's printhead. The distance between the printhead and platen
is defined as the record media gap. This gap must accommodate the passage of
record media therethrough without smearing, but spacing should be kept to a
minimum so as to maximize the quality of print. Consequently, the platen is set
at a distance from the printer's printhead which is approximately equal to the
nominal record media thickness plus the desired printhead-to-medium spacing
(Dm).A problems arises, however, where different types of record media
are used, particularly where such record media are of differing thicknesses, or
where the different record media experience differing degrees of curl. This
situation most commonly arises in ink-jet printers where both paper sheets and
envelopes are to be printed on. Envelopes, it will be appreciated, are of a
different thickness than paper sheets due to multiple paper layers, and experience
increased curl due to the flap and adhesive used. These factors impact on the
printhead-to-medium spacing and consequently impact on the overall quality of
print. For example, where thicker record media is used, the risk of ink smear is
increased. Although the risk of ink smear may be decreased by expanding the
record media gap, such an expanse would impact negatively on the accuracy of 
ink dot placement due to the increase in distance to be
travelled by the ejected ink.One solution to this problem involves the adjustment
of the record media gap whenever a new form of record media
is used. In the past this has involved operator-directed
adjustment of the printer's printhead or platen, an adjustment
which requires complex mechanism and which requires the
operator to

<CLAIMS>
A printer comprising:

a printhead (26a);
a platen (18a) movable towards and away from the
printhead for adjusting a record media gap;
record media detection means (24) arranged in a path
of movement of said media towards the printhead (26a) so as

to detect record media of a predetermined width and thereby
make an adjustment of the record media gap;

   characterised in that said detection means includes
camming means (40) which can be contacted, and thereby

caused to move, by said media of a predetermined width,
whereby the camming means (40) releases a stop (42) that

enables movement of the platen (18a) for automatically
adjusting the media gap to suit such media.
A printer according to claim 1, wherein the platen is
normally biased in a direction to close the record media

gap; the stop (42) abutting the camming means (40) to
maintain a wider media gap to suit media which is thicker,

but narrower than said predetermined width, and the stop
being released to reduce the media gap to suit said media of

a predetermined width.
A printer according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the camming
means includes a tab (40) having a camming surface (40a) for

contacting said media and an abutment surface (42a) for
abutting the stop (42).
A printer according to claim 3, wherein the tab (40)

normally protrudes through an opening (20a) in a recording
media guide.
A printer according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the tab
(40) is biased by gravity into its position for abutting the

stop (42). 
A printer according to claim 3, 4 or 5, wherein the
camming surface (40a) of the tab (40) is inclined towards

the approaching media.
A printer according to any preceding claim, wherein the
stop (42) is on the platen (18a).
A printer according to any preceding claim, wherein the
platen (18a) is pivotally mounted and is biased to rotate

against the stop (42).
A printer according to any preceding claim, wherein the
platen (18a) is provided with a catch (18b) that engages a

second stop (34) on the printer, whereby the media gap is
set to suit said media of a predetermined width.
A printer according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the camming means is positioned so as not to be

contacted by media having a width less than 12.7 cm (5
inches).
