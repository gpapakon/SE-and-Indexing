Ignition system for internal combustion 
engines with a monitoring circuit for generating a 

digital ignition diagnosis signal of such a type that a 
central control unit of the ignition system sets the 

ignition diagnosis signal to a first predetermined 
level before each ignition and switches the ignition 

diagnosis signal to a second level depending on the 
sensor signal either after each correct or after each 

incorrect ignition, the ignition being monitored by a 
sensor arranged in the ignition circuit, characterized 

in that an analysis device records the respective level 
of each ignition diagnosis signal (zü
nd OK) cylinder-selectively 
and undertakes a statistical weighting with 

preceding ignition diagnosis signals for each cylinder 
and in that an ignition diagnosis value (ZÜNTAB) 

weighted in this manner introduces emergency measures 
for protecting a catalyzer when a specified fault 

threshold (AFSDZU) is exceeded. 
Ignition system according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the analysis device increases the 

weighted ignition diagnosis value (ZÜNTAB) by an amount 
(DAFDZU) in the case of each faulty ignition and 

reduces it by 1 in the case of a correct ignition 
Ignition system according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the amount (DAFDZU) is greater than 1 

in the case of a faulty ignition. 
Ignition system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the fault  

 
threshold (AFSDZU) can be adjusted in practice for each 

engine type to values 
>
 1. 
Ignition system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the ignition 

diagnosis value (ZÜNTAB) is limited to an applicable 
maximum value (AFXDZU). 
Ignition system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the interval 

between the maximum value (AFXDZU) and the fault 
threshold (AFSDZU) determines the number of correct 

ignitions until correction of a fault is recognized. 
Ignition system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that in the case of 

fault correction, the ignition diagnosis value (ZÜNTAB) 
leads to the resetting of all the emergency measures 

when it falls below the fault threshold (AFSDZU). 
Ignition system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that when the fault 

threshold (AFSDZU) is exceeded, storage of the fault in 
the vehicle and a fault display for the driver are 

provided. 
Ignition system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that in the case of 

a fault, the injection for the corresponding cylinder 
is interrupted and the lambda control is switched off.
