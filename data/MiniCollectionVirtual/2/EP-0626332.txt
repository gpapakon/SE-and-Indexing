<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for producing a continuous web of adhesive labels is 
placed in nearby proximity to a computer printer (12) having a 

sheet-feeding 
tractor mechanism. A spool (28) of base tape material comprises 

superposed, continuous webs of a print-receiving layer and a 
carrier layer with the wider carrier layer including longitudinally 

spaced perforations extending in two laterally spaced rows 
outwardly of each side of the label layer. Spools (28,30) of base tape 

and 
transparent overlay tape materials are rotatably mounted upon 

spindles (72,74) on the apparatus with the base tape web (14) being 
directed 

from its spool (28) to and through the sheet-feeding mechanism of the 
printer (12). The perforations in the carrier layer are registered with 

the pins of the sheet-feeding mechanism and the printer performs a 
printing operation upon the label layer of the base tape web. The 

printed base tape web is directed back to the apparatus where the 
perforations in the carrier label are again placed in registry with 

pins of a web guide (18) on the apparatus. The web of base tape is 
guided from the printer and the web of overlay tape (24) is guided from 

its spool (30) to the entry of a pair of tangent pressure rollers 

(20,22), one 
of which has a handle (136) for manual advance of the superposed webs. 

As the webs pass through the rollers, the overlay tape is 
superposed with an adhered to the printed label layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus which produces labels by 
adhesively bonding a transparent overlay tape material in covering 
relation to the printed surface of an opaque base tape material 
and, more particularly, to such an apparatus which is a unitary, 
stand-alone unit for positioning adjacent a computer printer having 
a tractor-type paper feed mechanism. The apparatus is operable to 
concurrently deliver a continuous web of blank base tape material 
to the printer, receive the web of printed base tape material 
therefrom, and adhesively apply a continuous web of transparent 
overlay tape material thereto thereby producing a continuous web of 
smudge-proof, dirt-resistant labels which are cut or otherwise 
separated from the web into individual labels for application to a 
substrate such as the binding of a library book, for example. The type of base and overlay tape materials preferably used to 
make the labels with the present invention are disclosed in prior 
U.S. Patent No. 4,564,411, which issued on January 14, 1986 to 
Gaylord Bros., Inc., which patent is of common ownership with the 
present application. The '411 patent discloses three different 
embodiments of label producing apparatus which operate by 
detachably mounting to a typewriter or printer having rolling, 
movable and fixed platens. In each of the embodiments, individual 
spools of the base tape material and overlay tape material are 
rotatably mounted upon respective spindles and are unwound  
 
therefrom and ultimately directed between an upper, pressure-loaded 
roller and a lower drive roller which are rotatably mounted with 
tangent surfaces in rolling engagement with one another. In two of 
the three embodiments which detachably mount to typewriters having 
rolling, and moving and rolling platens, respectively, the 
typewriter platen serves as the drive roller. In the embodiment 
which detachably mounts to a printer having a fixed platen and 
sheet-feeding tractor mechanism, the drive roller shaft of the 
label producing apparatus coaxially connects to the drive shaft of 
the sheet-feeding tractor mechanism of the printer. The base tape 
material spool is mounted via a second assembly to an internal 
portion of the printer housing with the base tape material being 
directed upwardly therefrom, between the fixed platen and printer 
head of the printer, and between the feed rollers which are located 
thereabove on the printer housing. While the invention of the '411 patent improved upon such 
label producing apparatus in

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for use with a printer for producing 
laminated printed labels comprising a first continuous web 

(16) of transparent adhesive overlay tape material fixed to 
a second continuous web (14) of printed tape material; the 

apparatus comprising a support frame (44,46,50,52,56,58); 
first and second spindles (74,72), each mounted upon the 

frame with spaced, parallel axes for supporting spools 
(30,28) of the webs of overlay tape material and the base 

tape material to be printed respectively; pressing means 
comprising first and second rollers (20,22) mounted on the 

frame for rotation about axes spaced from and parallel to 
the spindle axes, the rollers (20,22) being biased 

together; drive means (136) for effecting rotation of the 
first roller (22); and, second web guide means (18) mounted 

upon the frame and including spaced engagement portions 
(108,110) respectively engaging opposite, lateral edge 

portions of the second web; characterised in that the 
support frame is free-standing and arranged to work 

remotely from the printer whereby, in use, the second web 
(14) can pass from the second spool (28) to a print head of 

the printer and return through the second web guide means 
(18) to the pressing means, and whereby the first web (16) 

passes directly from the first spool (30) to the pressing 
means, such that actuation of the drive means causes the 

webs to be drawn through the pressing means and adhered 
together. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second web 
guide means (18) is a non-driven movable pin feeder and the 

second web comprises lateral rows of spaced perforations 
(38) for cooperating with pins of the pin feeder. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, including 
first web guide means (92) mounted on the frame comprising 

spaced, lateral edge engaging portions (94,96) to establish 
 

a path of travel of the first web (16) from the first spool 
(30) to the pressing means (20,22). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, whereby the spaced 
engagement portions of the first and/or second web guide 

means (92,18) respectively are selectively adjustable to 
vary the spacing thereof to accommodate webs of different 

widths. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, whereby the first and second spindles (74,72) are 

each mounted to the frame only at one end. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, including inner stop members (86,84) mounted upon 

the first and second spindles (74,72), respectively, and

spindle. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, including adjustable 
outer stop members (90,88) selectively positionable on the 

first and second spindles (74,72) and extending radially 
outwardly therefrom whereby a spool placed on the first or 

second spindle respectively will be laterally constrained 
between the inner and outer stop members. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 5 to 7, 
wherein the support frame means comprises a planar panel 

member (56) and a base (44,46,50,52), the first and second 
spindles (74,72) being mounted on the panel me
mber so as to 
extend perpendicularly therefrom. 
Apparatus according to claim 8, including means 
(58,62,64) for detachably securing the panel to the base 

such that the axes of the first and second spindles and the 
first and second rollers are parallel to one another. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, whereby the driving means is a handle (136) 

operatively connected to the first roller (22) for 
selective manual actuation of the pressing means.
