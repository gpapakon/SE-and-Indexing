Apparatus for the rotary drive of a winding shaft (10) of an 
automatic safety belt retractor comprising a drivable rotary member (4, 

7) which is rotatably arranged in a housing (8) and a coupling with 
which the driven rotary member (4, 7) can be coupled to the winding 

shaft (10), wherein formed between the rotary member (4, 7) and an 
inside wall (11) of the housing (8) is at least one explosion chamber 

(3) which rotates by virtue of the rotary movement of the rotary member 

(4, 7), and at least one first force storage means which is in the form 
of a propellent charge (2) and which at the beginning of the rotary 

movement is connected to the explosion chamber (3) and which can be 
fired to start the rotary movement of the rotary member (4, 7) by a 

firing device (1) which can be triggered by actuation of a sensor 
device,
 
   characterised in that
 
   arranged along the rotary path of the explosion chamber (3) is 

at least one further force storage means which is in the form of a 
propellent charge (2, 5) and which can be fired when the explosion 

chamber (3) reaches the location of the further propellent charge (2, 
5) in the rotary movement of the rotary member (4, 7). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
propellent gas charge or charges (5) which follow the first propellent 

gas charge (2) in the rotary movement of the explosion chamber can be 
fired by the propellent gas temperature obtaining in the explosion 

chamber (3) or mechanically by the rotary member. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
propellent gas charge or charges (5) which follow the first propellent 

gas charge (2) can be fired by a firing device (1).  
 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the spacing between successive propellent gas charges (2, 5) is 

less than the extent of the explosion chamber (3) in the direction of 
rotation. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that a progressive boost force is applied to the rotary member (7) by 

the successive propellent gas charges (2, 5). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that a coupling actuating device (13) is provided at the inside of the 

rotary member (4, 7). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in 
that coupling elements (14) are moved by the rotary movement of the 

rotary member (4, 7) into a coupling position in which a force-locking 
engagement is made between the winding shaft (10) and the rotary member 

(4, 7). 
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that a guide 
device (9) for the coupling elements (14) is held stationarily relative 

to the rotating rotary member (4, 7) until the force-locking engagement 
is made between the winding shaft (10) and the rotary member (4, 7) by 

the coupling elements (14). 
Apparatus according to claim 7 or claim 8 characterised in that 
the rotary member (4, 7) has around its axis of rotation a cavity (18) 

in which the coupling elements (14) are arranged and into which 
projects an engagement member for the coupling elements (14), the 

engagement member being non-rotatably connected to the winding shaft 
(10).  

 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in 
that the rotary member is in the form of a rotary piston (4). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in 
that the rotary member is in the form of a bladed wheel (7). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in 
that the rotary member (7) is rotatably mounted at its periphery at the 

cylindrical inside wall (11) of the housing (8) and at least one 
explosion chamber (3) is provided at the periphery of the rotary member
