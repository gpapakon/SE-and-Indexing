<ABSTRACT>
A printing apparatus has a control unit for 
controlling the driving of a print head in accordance 

with a temperature measured by a sensor which is 
provided on a movable carriage for mounting the print 

head. The control unit controls a sensor such that the 
sensor measures the temperature when the carriage is in 

a position where the heat from motors or the like in 
the printing apparatus does not affect the sensor on 

the carriage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for controlling a printing operation in
accordance with a temperature of a print head, and more
particularly, to a printing apparatus and method in which
the temperature of a print head is measured with high
precision and the print head is controlled in accordance
with the measured result.In an ink jet printing apparatus, an ink droplet is
discharged from a discharge opening of a print head using
thermal energy onto a printing medium. The ink jet
printing apparatus has several advantages such as high
speed printing, high resolution, high image quality and
low noise output.The ink in a nozzle of the print head is heated
rapidly by an ink discharge heater and the force of film
boiling occurring in the 
ink causes an ink droplet to be discharged from the
discharge opening of the print head. Therefore, the
temperature of the print head influences the stability
of the amount of the ink droplet. In a conventional
ink jet printing apparatus, an expensive sensor for
measuring the temperature of the print head is provided
on the print head. The temperature of the print head
is controlled on the basis of this measurement to
maintain the temperature of the print head
within a certain range, or an ink discharge
recovery operation is controlled on the basis of the
measured result. These control methods are called
closed-loop control methods.A drive control of the print head for stable
discharging is performed based on the temperature of an
ink discharge heater of the print head. However, even
if the temperature of the heater is
constant, since the temperature of the ink is
influenced by ambient temperature, a discharge amount
varies in accordance with the ambient temperature. In
order to diminish this variation, the print head is
driven in accordance with a table in which the
combination of the temperature of the ink and the
temperature of the discharge heater are stored such
that the discharge amount of the ink is to be the same
even if the temperature of the ink changes. Therefore,
it is important to detect the ambient temperature of
the print head precisely.Figs. 2A-2C are schematic cross sectional views
for explaining the mechanism of ink jet printing. In

passage of a print head, reference numeral 202 denotes
ink, reference numeral 203 denotes a heater for heating
