<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a viewing apparatus exhibiting a high 
performance and an image forming apparatus including the 

same. 
The viewing apparatus of this invention comprises a 
projection optical system (104) for projecting an image on a 

viewer's eye (101), means (113) for detecting a refracting power of 
the viewer's eye and means for adjusting (114) the projection 

optical system so that the image is formed substantially 
on a viewer's eye fundus (105). 
The imaging apparatus of this invention comprises 
means for forming an image of an object, a projection 

optical system for projecting the object image on the 
viewer's eye, means for detecting a refracting power of 

the viewer's eye and means for adjusting the projection 
optical system so that the object image is formed 

substantially on the viewer's eye fundus in accordance 
with the refracting power of the viewer's eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a viewing
apparatus and, especially, to automation of a diopter
adjustment mechanism of a viewfinder of a silver halide
film camera, an electronic still camera, a cam coder and a
microscope and the like.A remarkable advancement of putting a single-lens
reflex camera into an electronic form has been seen in
recent years. Electronic versions of a focusing mechanism
and an exposure mechanism have been sequentially offered.
Recently, there has been offered a so-called visual axis
input autofocus camera in which a visual axis direction of
the photographer is detected, and focusing at a point of
gazing is attained. FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. 1-241511,
the arrangement being such that a visual axis
direction detecting unit is incorporated into the single-lens
reflex camera, and the focusing is performed to one
of detected fields of a plurality of focus detection units
116. The visual axis detection unit includes elements
marked with 709 through 714. The numeral 709 indicates an
eyepiece; 710 denotes a visible transmission/infrared
reflection dichroic mirror; 711 represents a light 
projecting/receiving lens; 712 stands for a half-mirror;
713 designates an eyeball illumination light source; and
714 is a sensor having a multiplicity of pixels. Provided
further are a phototaking lens 115 and a flip-up mirror
117. A visual axis direction is obtained from mutual
positions of a plurality of Purkinje images or mutual
positions of the first Purkinje image and the center of
the pupil. The method of obtaining the visual axis
direction has already been known in the above Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Application and the other documents, and,
therefore, the explanation thereof will be omitted. In
any case, intention of the photographer is reflected in an
phototaken image by adopting the visual axis input system,
and a higher-level photographic expression can be
actualized.In the conventional cameras, however, an optical
system of a viewfinder is fixed, and hence the following
defects arise irrespective of magnitude of a visual acuity
(or an eye refracting power) of the photographer.In an ordinary camera and a video finder which do not
take the visual axis input system, especially a myopic
photographer (having a larger eye refracting power) sees a
blurred image of the finder and is therefore required to
invariably wear spectacles. It is difficult to view an
object through the eyepiece, resulting in a failure of
taking a

An observing apparatus having a projecting optical system
(104) for projecting an object image onto an eye (101) of an

observer, comprising:

image detecting means (113) for receiving a first
reflection light from a fundus of said eye (101);
controlling means (114) for detecting a refracting power
of said eye (101) based on an output of said image detecting

means, said controlling means (114) including adjusting means
for adjusting said observing apparatus so that said object

image is substantially focused on said fundus of said eye
(101) based on a result of detection of said refracting

power,

said image detecting means (113) is disposed at a
position in optical conjugation with a pupil of said eye such

that a second image by a second reflection light from said
pupil of said eye and a neighborhood of said pupil is formed

on said image detecting means (113) and a first image by said
first reflection light from said eye fundus is formed in

front of said image detecting means (113);
said observing apparatus is adapted to change a
distribution of intensity of light on said image detecting

means by said first and second reflection light according to
said refracting 
power of said eye and a direction of visual
axis of said eye; and
