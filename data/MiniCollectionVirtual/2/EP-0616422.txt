<ABSTRACT>
To suppress electromagnetic radiation without exerting 
any harmful influence upon both S/N ratio and dynamic 

range, a pulse width modulation circuit includes: an 
integrating circuit (10) for integrating an input signal 

applied to an input terminal with respect to time; a 
comparing circuit (20) provided output side of the integrating 

circuit and having hysteresis characteristics; a 
feedback circuit (30) for feeding back the output of the 

comparing circuit to an input of the integrating circuit; 
and an amplitude modulation circuit (40) provided in a loop 

including the integrating circuit and the comparing 
circuit, for implementing amplitude modulation to modulate 

a frequency of the output of the comparing circuit. 
Further, the output of the comparing circuit can be fed-back 

to the integrating circuit via an amplitude modulation 
circuit. Alternatively, the amplitude of the output of the 

integrating circuit is first modulated by the amplitude 
modulation circuit, before applied to the comparing 

circuit. A dither signal is applied to the amplitude 
modulation circuit or, alternatively, a signal for maintaining 

frequency of the pulse modulated signal may be 
applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pulse width
modulation circuit comprising:
an input terminal;an integrator circuit for integrating an input
signal applied to said input terminal with respect to
time;a comparator circuit, provided at an output side
of said integrator circuit, having first and second
threshold values, and arranged to compare the input
signal thereof with the first and second threshold
values;an output terminal connected to an output of said
comparator circuit; anda feedback circuit for feeding back the output of
said comparator circuit to an input of said integrator
circuit. Such a pulse width modulation circuit is
known from GB-A-2 096 850. The invention may be
implemented in a pulse width modulation (PWM) circuit
for controlling a duty factor of an output pulse
thereof in response to an amplitude of an analog input
signal, and finds particular application in a pulse
width modulation circuit suitable for use to amplify
power of audio signals.A pulse width modulation circuit is generally composed
of an input terminal for receiving signals to be pulse
width modulated, an integrating circuit, input side thereof
being connected to the input terminal, a pulse width
modulated wave output terminal, an output terminal for
outputting a pulse modulated signal. The PWM circuit also
includes a comparing circuit having a hysteresis characteristic
for comparing an input signal with a reference signal
applied to a reference input terminal to output the
comparison result to the output terminal, and a feedback
circuit for feeding back the pulse width modulated wave
obtained at a pulse width modulated wave output terminal
to the input terminal of the integrating circuit. Under the condition that no input signal is applied to
the pulse width modulated wave input terminal, the following
monotonous oscillating operation is repeated: a
potential change of the integrating circuit (across a
capacity) due to current flowing through the feedback
circuit is acquired by the comparing circuit, and the
direction of the current flowing through the feedback
circuit is switched according to the polarity of the output
of the comparing circuit. The pulse generated by this
oscillation becomes a carrier. Here, when an analog input
signal is applied to the pulse width modulated wave input 
terminal, since the potential change rate of the integrating
circuit is subjected to the influence of the input
signal amplitude, the polarity inversion time changes at
the output of the comparing circuit. In other words, since
the duty
