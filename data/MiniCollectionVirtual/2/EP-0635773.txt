<ABSTRACT>
One initial position of the mobile unit (E) is known. The first self-position of the unit is determined relative to the initial position with a position uncertainty. A first distance from the first position to a landmark (L) is determined with a bearing uncertainty. The first position and the landmark serve as the starting map. A second distance from a second self-position to the landmark is determined, so that, using the standing map, a predicted second distance to the landmark is computed. At least one difference between the computed predicted second distance and the determined second distance is determined as a system fault.

Method for producing an environment card and
for determining a self-position of an automotive unit

in an environment by means of the automotive unit, in
which


a) starting from an initial position of the
automotive unit, a change in position is

carried out and determined by at least
one first measuring means arranged on

the unit;
b) a first self-position (P1K) of the
automotive unit is determined relative

to the initial position, taking account
of a positional uncertainty (U1K) of the

automotive unit;
c) a starting distance from a landmark is
measured by a second measuring means

arranged on the automotive unit;
d) taking account of the positional
uncertainty and of the starting distance

to the landmark (LP), a first distance
is established with a positional

uncertainty (ULP) between the automotive
unit and the landmark;
e) the first self-position (P1K) and the
landmark, which can be determined from

the first distance to the automotive
unit, form an environment card; 
f) with the aid of a further positional
change
, determined by the first
measuring means, of the automotive unit,

a second self-position (P2P) is
determined relative to the first

self-position (P1K), taking account of
the positional uncertainty (U2P) of the

automotive unit;
g) a first second distance (MP) to the
landmark is predicted using the second

self-position with the aid of the
environment card;
h) a second second distance (MR) is
measured between the automotive unit and

the landmark;
i) a difference (
) between the first
second distance (MP) and the second

second distance (MR) is determined as
system error;
j) as a function of the positional
uncertainty (U2P) of the self-position

and the positional uncertainty of the
landmark, the difference (
) is
subdivided into a positional correction

(PK) and a positional correction (LKO)
with the aid of which the second

self-position (P2P to P2K) and the
position of the landmark (LP to LK) in

the environment card are corrected.
Method according to Claim 1, in which a
plurality of landmarks are taken into account

simultaneously.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the
steps f) to j) are applied iteratively, and thus the

environment card is refined by further positional
changes of the automotive unit.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which an environment card is prescribed. 
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, in which a position of at least one

additionally detected landmark is entered in the
environment card.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, in which the measuring means is a distance-measuring

unit.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, in which the positional correction (LKO)



and the positional correction (PK)


are determined using


a positional uncertainty


a positional uncertainty


a system error

calculated predicted landmark distance
(MP) at time k + 1 with

z and(k+1/k)=h(x and(k+1/k),p and

predicted self-position (P2P) of the
unit at time k + 1,

difference value.
Method according to Claim 7, in which it holds
that R(k + 1) = 0.
