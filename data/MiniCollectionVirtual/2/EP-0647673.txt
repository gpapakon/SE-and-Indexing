<ABSTRACT>
An expandable polyolefin composition and a method 
of preparation are provided. Isobutane or mixtures of 

isobutane with other physical blowing agents are utilized 
to expand polyolefin compositions which have been modified 

by the addition of a stability control agent. The 
composition has a high degree of dimensional stability and 

exhibits minimal shrinkage during curing and/or aging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This inventio relates to expandable olefin
polymer compositions, and more particularly
to expandable modified olefin polymer compositions having
dimensional stability and to processes utilizing low cost isobutane as a
primary blowing agent.It is well known to prepare olefin polymer foams
by heat plastifying a normally solid olefin polymer resin,
admixing such heat plastified resin with a volatile
blowing agent under heat and pressure to form a flowable
gel and thereafter extruding the gel into a zone of lower
pressure and temperature to activate the blowing agent and
expand and cool the gel to form the desired solid olefin
foam product.GB-A- 1 059 426 (in example 4) discloses the preparation of a soft
rubbery foamed product wherein a 1 : 1 mixture of 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane
and iso-butane was used as the foaming agent.
The obtained product is an open cell foam.DE-B-1 282 918 discloses the use of branched C4-6 hydrocarbons, among
which isobutane, as blowing agent for foaming of olefinic (co)polymer
resins.
In example 2 it is disclosed that isobutane leads to a lesser shrinked
EVA foam than n-butane. The results of said example 2 indicate that the
foam in question most probably was a substantially open cell foam.US-A- 4 368 276 and US-A- 4 528 300 disclose a conventional polyolefin
extrusion foaming process wherein a stability control agent (e.g. a
fatty acid amide) and a certain volatile organic blowing agent is used.
The blowing agent is a halogenated hydrocarbon compound. US-A 3,808,300 relates to a process improvement in the extrusion of plastic foam
based on using temperatures slightly below the melting point of the crystalline polymer
being extruded to obtain low density foams, i.e. foams having a high degree of
expansion. It discloses broad classes of polymers which can be employed in the
patented process and further a broad classes of blowing agents to be used with these
polymers. There is no suggestion in the reference, aside from the examples, as to
which blowing agent or combination of blowing agents is suitable with any one of the
olefin polymer described, which include polymers formed from one or more of a
great variety of monomers.US-A 4,217,319 relates to a limited improvement in the extrusion of foams. More
particularly, it relates to a particular way of adding an ester of a long chain fatty acid
and a polyhydric alcohol such as GMS. A broad listing of suitable polymers and
blowing agents is set forth in without any particular suggestion of which polymer is
to be combined with which
