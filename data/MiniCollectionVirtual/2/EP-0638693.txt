<ABSTRACT>
The component (7) is for a rail of sheet-metal joined at the end to a transverse angle-section (6). A plate (8) formed on it is inserted in the double-skinned rib (2) of the rail (1) and which joins on to a top hollow bead (3). It has a supporting foot (9) protruding beyond the rail end, and which rests on the horizontal flange (10) of the angle-section. A guide flange (12) can be bent over horizontally from the top edge of the plate, bearing against the bottom of the bead on the inside, and at the bottom of the foot there can be two supporting lugs, extending obliquely downwards and in opposite directions.

Arrangement for the front face attachment of a T-section bar (1) of a false
ceiling to a transverse contact angle section (6), where the T-section bar (1) is made

from sheet metal and comprises a double-wall web plate (2) with hollow edge bead
(3) at the top, having a support member (7), which is inserted into the front face of the

double-wall web plate (2) using an insert plate (8, 8') that is formed on said support
member (7), the latter being supported by the horizontal side (10) of the contact angle

section (6) by means of a support foot (9) located in front of the head of the T-section
bar (1).
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the insert plate (8, 8')
has a horizontally bent guide flange (12) along its top edge, said guide flange resting

inside against the bottom of the edge bead (3) of the T-section bar (1).
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the support foot
(9) has, along its lower edge, two support plates (11) which are bent at an angle

downwards in opposite directions.
Arrangement according to claims 1 to 3, characterised by a stop plate (13) that
is bent to the side and comes out flush with the insert plate (8, 8'), said stop plate 

forming a stop for the front end of the T-section bar.
Arrangement according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
height of the insert plate (8) is considerably less than the height of the double-wall

section of the web plate (2) of the T-section bar (1).
Arrangement according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
height of the insert plate (8') is the same as or only slightly less than the height of the
