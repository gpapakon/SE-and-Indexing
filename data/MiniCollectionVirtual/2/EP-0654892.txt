<ABSTRACT>
A microprocessor (5) or an equivalent circuit is assigned to the stepper motor (1). This microprocessor (5) is driven via a control line (9) and via an analogue to digital converter (6) by means of an analogue control signal in order, for its part, to control the stepper motor (1) via power electronics (4). Acknowledgements can be transmitted in digital form via a line (11) and the control line (9). At the same time, the microprocessor (5) carries out a wide range of monitoring and control tasks, for example detection of switching losses, regulation of the torque, compensation for instabilities in the stepper motor (1) and regulation of the motor position. In the simplest case, a potentiometer (10) can be used as the control device and, nevertheless, very versatile control and monitoring of the stepper motor are possible.
