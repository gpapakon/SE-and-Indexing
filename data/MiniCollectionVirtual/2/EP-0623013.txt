<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for increasing the density and strength of bone, particularly for preventing or treating osteoporosis, by subjecting the bone to unfocussed compressional shock waves. The treatment is effected by a shock wave generator (8) adapted to be coupled to the bone being treated by an acoustic coupling (10). In one embodiment the shock wave generator (8) includes a spark gap (2) at the focal point of a paraboloidal reflector (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR TREATING OSTEOPOROSISThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus particularly useful for treating osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a bone disorder which affects middle and old age people, especially women. It is characterized by an abnormal loss of bone tissue, and consequently by a decrease in the density of the bone. The reduction in bone density reduces the strength of the bone such as to make the afflicted person susceptible to easy fracture, particularly of the pelvis (hip), spine, femoral neck, and forearm.Osteoporosis affects millions of elderly people. In the USA, it affects about one out of every four women over the age of 45, and half of all women over the age of 60. Each year approximately 200,000 persons break a hip because of osteoporosis. It is therefore one of the major causes for prolonged hospitalization of the elderly; and resulting complications, particularly from hip fracture, constitute a frequent cause of death in the USA.At the present time there is no generally accepted cure for osteoporosis, although various treatments are used with varying degrees of success. Thus, calcium supplementation, regular exercise, and enhanced physical activity may prevent deterioration of the bone; arid at a later stage, more elaborate treatment, such as the administering of hormones, calcium, phosphate and vitamin D analogues may be used.An object of the present invention is to provide a novel method of increasing the density and strength of the bone, particularly for preventing or treating osteoporosis. Another object of the invention is to provide apparatus for use in such treatment.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of increasing the density and 

strength of the bone, particularly for preventing or treating osteoporosis comprising subjecting the bone to unfocussed compressional shock waves. Such unfocussed shock waves thus produce dynamic repetitive loading of the bone. This increases the mean bone density, and thereby strengthens the bone against fracture.According to further features in the preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the unfocussed shock waves are applied to the bone at an intensity of 50-500 atmospheres, and in the form of substantially planar,2 unfocussed wavefronts covering an area of from 10 to 150 cm of the bone.According to one described embodiment, the unfocussed shock waves are applied by a point-source shock wave generator located at the focal point of a
