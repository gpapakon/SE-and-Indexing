<ABSTRACT>
A filtrate which has passed a filter bed (2) of granular filter medium intended for treating a suspension or a liquid solution can contain air bubbles and granular filter medium as a result of a gas, preferably air, being brought into contact with the filter medium. Separation of air bubbles and filter medium now takes place by the filtrate before being taken away from the filtering process, being caused to flow substantially downwards in a special path (12a; 15) at a rate sufficiently low for gas bubbles to rise upwards and is subsequently taken substantially upwards at a rate sufficiently low for the granular filter medium to be separated by precipitation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
separating gas bubbles and granular filter medium from a 
filtrate, which has passed a filter bed formed by the filter 
medium intended for biological treatment of a suspension or 
liquid solution, in this treatment a gas, e.g. air, being in 
contact with the filter medium, the uppermost layer of the 
filter bed hereby being whirled up by the gas bubbles so that 
the filtrate above the filter bed is contaminated by the filter 
medium and gas bubbles, which filtrate is passed to an outlet. 
The invention is particularly usable in a continuously 
operating reactor for biological nitrogen reduction of a 
suspension or liquid solution.  
 From the Swedish patent specification 396 552 it is known to 
perform filtration of a suspension or an emulsion in a filter 
bed of particulate filter medium by allowing the suspension to 
flow upwards through the filter bed simultaneously as the 
filter medium flows downwards through a filtration tank, 
wherein filtration takes place. Supply of suspension takes 
place in the lower part of the filter bed and the filtered liquid 
phase is taken out from a zone above the filter bed. The polluted 
filter medium close to the bottom of the filtration tank is 
taken out for conveyance to a washing apparatus above the 
filter bed and after washing is returned to the upper surface 
of the filter bed. Such conveyance of the filter medium takes 
place most simply using a so-called air lift pump, which works 
with such as air as a conveying medium. It is also known to use a continuously operating granular 
filter bed for biological nitrogen reduction of a suspension or 
liquid solution, i.e. nitrification and denitrification. 
Bacterial strains suitable for the purpose are used in this 
case, and these bacteria are established in the filter bed. In 
the nitrification process, primarily ammonium compounds are 
oxidized to nitrates with the aid of oxygen, usually coming 
from air. Sand of a suitable grain size is preferably used as a 
filter medium. When the filter is used as a nitrification 
reactor, a relatively large air stream is blown into the lower  
 
part of the filter bed. However, the stream must be restricted 
to the order of magnitude which does not cause fluidizing of 
the filter bed. The uppermost layer of the filter sand is even 
so inevitably whirled up by air bubbles, causing the filtrate 
above the filter bed to be contaminated by sand and air bubbles. This whirling 
sand mixed with air bubbles causes

Method of separating gas bubbles and granular filter medium 
from a filtrate, which has passed a filter bed formed by the 

filter medium intended for biological treatment of a suspension 
or liquid solution, in this treatment a gas, e.g. air, being 

in contact with the filter medium, the uppermost layer of the 
filter bed hereby being whirled up by the gas bubbles so that 

the filtrate above the filter bed is contaminated by the filter 
medium and gas bubbles, which filtrate is passed to an outlet, 


characterized
 in that before reaching the outlet the filtrate 
is caused to flow substantially downwards in a special path at 

a rate sufficiently low for gas bubbles to separate and move 
upwards, the filtrate being subsequently led upwards at a rate 

sufficiently low for the granular filter medium to separate by 
movement downwards. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, intended for nitrification, 
where air is blown into the granular filter medium, 


characterized
 in that said upward flow of the filtrate takes 
place immediately before the filtrate is discharged from the 

filtering process. 
Method as claimed in claim 1 and 2, 
characterized
 in that 
the filter medium from the bed is continually taken out in its 

most polluted state and is cleaned by filtrate in a washing 
apparatus in the filtrate zone for subsequent refluxing to the 

bed, that downward flow of filtrate takes place in a path 
through the filtrate zone close to the washing apparatus 

towards the inlet of the washing apparatus, thereby separating 
gas bubbles from the filtrate subsequently used as washing 

liquid to which is given a low upwardly moving velocity in the 
washing apparatus. 
An apparatus for carrying out a method in accordance with 
claim 1, which comprises a tank (1) containing a filter bed (2) 

of a granular filter medium and a filtrate zone (3) above it, 
and having an outlet (8) for the filtrate at the filtrate level  

 
(10), 
characterized
 in that a first chamber (15) with an inlet 
placed at the filtrate level (10) and an outlet placed below 

for the filtrate is located in the filtrate zone to form a path 
for separating gas bubbles, said first chamber (15) having flow 

communication from its outlet to a second chamber (16) via an 
inlet placed low in this chamber, an outlet for the filtrate 

from the second chamber being placed no higher than the 
filtrate level and being in flow connection with the outlet (8) 

for the filtrate from the tank (1), said second chamber (16) 
having a low placed outlet opening for the granular filter 

medium sedimented from the filtrate in said second chamber for 
returning the filter medium to the filter bed (2). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
 in that both 
chamber (15, 16) are disposed in the tank adjacent the outlet 

(8) of the filtrate. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the 
chambers (15,16) are formed as a trough-like container 

comprising two mutually opposing and mutually inclined, 
downwardly sloping wa
lls (13,14) which leave a slot-like 
opening at the bottom and an approximately vertical plate 

extending towards the bottom but leaving an opening along it 
for the formation of a flow passage between the chambers. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 3 to 6, 
characteized
 
in that a washing apparatus (5) comprising a vertical washing 

path (6) for the filter medium is located in the filtrate zone 
(3), to which washing apparatus filtrate as washing liquid is 

supplied at its lower part via a chamber (12a), which is formed 
between the washing path (6) and a concentrically arranged 

cylinder (12) for effecting separation of gas bubbles, a 
horizontal sedimentation plate (11) is located under the inlet 

of the washing apparatus (5) and the chamber (12a) at a 
distance from it to receive filter medium sedimented from the 

filtrate in the chamber and to prevent gas bubbles from 
entering the washing path (6).
