<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a pointing device writing tip comprised of a surface being structured in a manner that while writing with the writing tip on a writing surface, the contacts of the writing tip with the writing surface produce different sounds in different directions. A hand writing recognition system is provided based on at least the recognition of sounds produced by the writing tip having a surface being structured in a manner that while writing with the writing tip on the writing surface, the contacts of the writing tip with the writing surface produce different sounds in different directions for use by the recognition system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Stylus ComputerField of the InventionThis invention relates to a data entry system and method based on hand-writing-sound recognition system, through which, a naturally, easily and quickly full text and functions input can be provided. It also relates to a computer mouse system for data entry and manipulation, for mobile and fix electronic devices. It finally relates to a stylus-type computer device, using the above-mentioned data entry methods and means.Background of the InventionMiniaturization has been a key component to recent technological advancement, enabling production of many devices that would otherwise be impracticable for reasons of size alone. In fact, the very essence of, for example, portable computers and cellular phones, is their size as a primary feature.Yet, primarily because of human constraints, there are many obstacles to the growth of miniaturization in several areas. For example, it 

may be desirable to have a portable computer that fits in one's wallet, but such a computer would not be useable without a large input device that enables human interaction with the computer. In other words, complex miniature computers and devices such as cellular phones (now, also used for the Internet, email, m-commerce, Short Massages Services, etc.), notebooks, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices, require keyboards, numeric pads or other input facilities to allow the user to enter a phone number, send e-mail or transcribe a letter, etc. Also a convenient LCD display for viewing data entered or received is an important feature. Thus, as advanced as miniaturization technology may get, there are other human factors involved that prevent certain devices from realizing a truly miniature state.As is well known, the key feature of a successful technological product, is its easily manipulations. For above-mentioned instruments and similar devices, a quickly, easily and most importantly, naturally, full text and function entry system is vital. Also a display device of the width of a standard text line is appreciable.Proposals have been put forward to solve this fundamental man- machine-interface problem of how to quickly and easily enter text and functions using small communication devices. 

 The telephone-type keypad, is the most common input device for small electronic and telecommunications instruments. It is integrated in many electronic devices such as mobile and wired telephones, PDA, notebooks, laptops, faxes, remote controllers of TVs or other electronic devices, cameras, etc. This keypad
