<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide and a process for
preparing the polyimide, and a aromatic diamino compound used for
preparing polyimide and a process for preparing the aromatic diamino
compound. More particularly an embodiment of the invention
relates to a thermoplastic polyimide having excellent heat
resistance and a preparation process thereof and further
relates to a polyimide based resin composition comprising
said polyimide and a fibrous reinforcement.A novel aromatic diamino compound of the formula (3-1) having a
pyridine skeleton and a novel aromatic diamino compound represented by
the formula (3-2) having a cyano radical are useful as the raw material
of polyimide in the invention and can also be applied to the raw
material of polyamide, polyimide, polyamideimide, bismaleimide and epoxy
resin.Conventionally, polyimide has been widely used in the field of
molding materials, composite materials and electric. electronic
appliances because polyimide has excellent heat resistance and
additionally is excellent in mechanical properties, chemical
resistance, flame retardance, electrical properties and other
characteristics.For example, a representative polyimide which has been known is
Kapton and Vespel (Trade Mark of E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co.) which
have recurring structural units of the formula (A) : 
The polyimide, however, is insoluble and infusible and thus must be
molded by using a specific technique such as sinter molding by way of
polyamic acid precursor. Such problem leads to difficulty in processing
and the process is difficult to provide articles having a complex
shape. Consequently, finishing operation such as cutting is
additionally required in order to obtain satisfactory articles and
causes a serious defect of high processing cost.Similarly, another type of polyimide which has been generally known
as a film forming resin is Upilex (Trade Mark of Ube Industries Co.)
which has recurring structural units represented by the formula (B) :

   wherein Ar is
The resin itself has no melt-flowability and cannot be extruded.
Consequently, the resin has a problem that the resin film can be
obtained by casting alone.Japanese Laid-Open Patent SHO 62-205124 has disclosed thermoplastic
polyimide which has improved glass transition temperature, melt-flowability 
and processability and has recurring structural units of the
formula (C) :
The polyimide has good melt-flowability and can be processed by
injection molding. The polyimide, however, is essentially crystalline
and thus
