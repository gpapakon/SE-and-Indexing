<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a premix (premixture) as starting substance for blending with a polyolefin or a polyolefin mixture for the preparation of a polyolefin coating composition for photographic layer supports. The invention furthermore relates to a polyolefin-containing masterbatch, to a coating composition for photographic layer supports and to the layer support itself. A common feature of the above materials is that the starting point is a premix containing, in proportions suitable in each case: pigment(s) and/or filler(s), dispersants and polyolefin wax(es).

A polyolefin coating material for photographic
film bases, produced by blending a polyolefin-containing

master batch with a polyolefin, the
master batch containing polyolefin, one or more

pigments, one or more fillers and dispersing agents
in suitable proportions,

characterised in that

the master batch contains one or more polyolefin
waxes having a melting point approximately equal to

or in no case more than ± 15°C from the melting-point
of the polyolefin processed in the master

batch, the content of polyolefin wax or waxes in the
master batch being made such that after dilution

with pure polyolefin the resulting polyolefin
coating material contains between 0.3 and 5 wt.%

polyolefin wax and the pigment content is over 15
wt.%.
A coating material according to claim 1,
characterised in that the polyolefin in the master

batch is a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or a
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or an ethylene/α-olefin

copolymer.
A coating material according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the polyolefin wax in the

master batch melts at 120 to 132°C, preferably at
127 ± 1°C. 
A coating material according to claim 1 or 2 or
3, characterised in that the polyolefin wax in the

master batch is a polyethylene wax.
A coating material according to claim 1 or 4,
characterised in that the pigment or pigments and

the filler or fillers in the master batch are one
substance or a mixture from the following group:

titanium dioxide, ultramarine, cobalt blue, cobalt
violet, carbon black, aluminium oxide, silicon

oxide, calcium carbonate and barium sulphate.
A coating material according to claim 1 or 5,
characterised in that the dispersing aid in the

master batch is a salt or an ester of a higher fatty
acid, preferably a zinc or calcium or magnesium

stearate.
A coating material according to any of the
preceding claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the

polyolefin used for dilution is a low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) or high-density polyethylene

(HDPE) or an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer.
A photographic film base comprising a substrate
provided on at least one flat side with a film base

made of a coating material according to any of
claims 1 to 7 and containing between 0.3 and 5 wt.%

of polyolefin wax, preferably between 0.5 and 3
wt.%.
