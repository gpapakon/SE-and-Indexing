<ABSTRACT>
Methods of diagnosing or prognosing Alzheimer's disease in a subject are disclosed. The method involves detecting the presence or absence of an apolipoprotein E type 4 (ApoE4) isoform or DNA encoding ApoE4 in the subject. The presence of ApoE4 indicates the subject is afflicted with Alzheimer's disease or at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of
diagnosing and prognosing Alzheimer's disease.The senile plaque and congophilic angiopathy
are abnormal extracellular structures found in abundance
in brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The
biochemical composition of these structures has been
extensively studied to better understand their possible
role in the pathogenesis of this dementing disease. The
mature senile plaque is a complex structure, consisting 
of a central core of amyloid fibrils surrounded by
dystrophic neurites, axonal terminals and dendrites,
microglia and fibrous astrocytes. See D. Selkoe Neuron 6,
487-498 (1991). The amyloid core of the senile plaque
surrounding blood vessels, producing the congophilic
angiopathy, is a peptide of 39 to 43 amino acids termed
the β-Amyloid (βA) peptide. G. Glenner and C. Wong,
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 120, 885-890 (1984). βA
peptide is found in brain in Alzheimer's disease, Down's
syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage of the Dutch
type, and in old age. K. Kosik, Science256, 780-783
(1992). βA is produced by abnormal proteolytic
processing of a larger protein, the amyloid precursor
protein (APP). See K. Beyreuther and C. Masters, Brain
Path. 1, 241-251 (1991).The senile plaque and congophilic angiopathy
contain proteins in addition to βA peptide. APP itself,
among others, has been identified in the senile plaque by
histochemical studies employing antibodies recognizing
either the amino- and carboxy-termini of the precursor
protein. See, e.g., F. Tagliavine et al., Neurosci.
Lett. 128, 117-120 (1991); C. Joachim et al., Amer. Jour.
Path.138, 373-384 (1991); The mechanisms by which these
proteins aggregate in the extracellular space to
associate with the senile. plaque and congophilic
angiopathy are not known.While there has been considerable research into
the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, there
continues to be an ongoing need for new ways to
investigate and combat this disorder. Methods of diagnosing, prognosing or screening for risk of Alzheimer's
disease in a subject are disclosed. The methods comprise detecting the
presence or absence of DNA encoding apolipoprotein E type 4 (ApoE4)
isoform, or detecting the presence or absence of ApoE4 isoform
in a biological sample of the subject. The presence of ApoE4 isoform or of
DNA encoding ApoE4 isoform indicates that the subject is afflicted with
Alzheimer's disease or at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.The foregoing and other objects and aspects of the instant invention are

<CLAIMS>
A method of diagnosing, prognosing or screening for risk of
Alzheimer's disease in a subject wherein the presence of apolipoprotein E

type 4 (ApoE4) isoform indicates said subject is afflicted with Alzheimer's
disease or at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, said method

comprising:

detecting the presence or absence of ApoE4, or DNA encoding it, in
a biological sample of said subject e.g., a blood sample.
A method of claim 1 wherein said subject has not previously been
diagnosed as afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.
A method of claim 1 or claim 2 said detecting step comprising
detecting whether said subject is homozygous for the gene encoding the

ApoE type 4 isoform.
A method of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said subject has
previously been determined to be at risk of developing Alzheimer's

disease.
A method of any of claims 1 to 4 wherein said subject is afflicted
with dementia.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said step of
detecting DNA encoding ApoE4 is carried out by amplifying DNA encoding

ApoE4.
A method according to claim 6 wherein said amplifying step is
carried out by polymerase chain reaction or by ligase chain reaction. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said step of
detecting ApoE4 is carried out by isoelectric focusing or by immunoassay,

optionally immunoassay with an antibody that selectively binds to the
ApoE4 isoform.
The use of a means of detecting apolipoprotein E type 4 isoform
(ApoE4), or DNA encoding it in a biological sample of a subject, in determining if said subject is afflicted with or

at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
A use of claim 9 when applied to diagnosing or determining the
prognosis of Alzheimer's disease in a subject.
A use of claim 9 or claim 10 when effected by detecting for DNA
encoding ApoE4.
A use of claim 9 or claim 10 when effected by directly detecting for
ApoE4.
A use of any one of claims 9 to 12 including detecting if said subject
is homozygous for the gene encoding ApoE4.
