<ABSTRACT>
Video format conversion apparatus and method for a high-definition 
TV including motion compensation of 

macroblocks, determining stationary condition, motion-involved 
condition or scene change pixel by pixel and achieving 

interpolation pixel-wise, thereby realizing 
conversion of a interlaced scanning video format into 

a progressive scanning video format. 
The video 
format conversion is achieved by substituting the value of 

the current pixel by the mean of the values of reference 
pixels, positioned at the same position 

in a previous respectively a next field when the 
current pixel is a stationary pixel; interpolating the current 

pixel through a motion compensation when the current pixel is 
a motion-involved pixel; determining whether a displaced frame 

difference is less than a predetermined threshold value when 
the current pixel is neither of the stationary nor the 

motion-involved type to substitute the current pixel value by 
the mean of the reference pixel values of the previous and 

next fields when the displaced frame difference is less than 
the threshold value, and substitute the current pixel value 

by an intra-field generated pixel value when the displaced frame 
differen
ce is above the threshold value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video format conversion
apparatus and method for a television (TV), and more
particularly to video format conversion apparatus and method
for a TV for converting an interlaced video format into a
progressive video format.High definition TVs (HDTVs) of the interlaced scanning
system developed in Japan and being experimentally on the air
utilize easily a video source because their peripheral
appliances such as camera and video cassette recorders have
already been developed. In a case of a HDTV of the
progressive scanning system developed in U.S.A., it is
difficult to utilize a video source of the progressive
scanning system because of no peripheral appliance developed.
In the latter case, it, therefore, is required to convert a
video of the interlaced scanning format into a video of the
progressive scanning format. In particular, the format of
videos displayed on a monitor should be of the progressive
scanning system. For transmitting compressed videos of the
interlaced scanning format, accordingly, it is important and
essential to efficiently convert them into those of the
progressive scanning format as a display format. In conventional analog systems, pixel (line)
interpolation for NTSC TV or digital TV is carried out using
one of the following methods:
First, the intra-field interpolation that is to
interpolate lines not scanned by using scanned lines in the
current field. Although this method is most simple, there is
a problem of a deterioration in resolution because each line
is interpolated by the mean value of pixels on scanned upper
and lower lines positioned with respect to the line to be
interpolated;Second, the inter-field interpolation that is to simply
interpolate lines not scanned by using scanned lines of the
current field and other fields, without any motion
compensation. Although recovering videos with high resolution
for stationary video portions, there is a problem of a severe
artifact for motion-involved video portions: andThird, the interpolation involving the motion
compensation. This method solves the problems encountered in
the intra-field interpolation method and the inter-field
interpolation method.In accordance with the interpolation method involving the
motion compensation, motion information is searched. Based on
the searched motion information, a video scene is divided into
a stationary video portion and a motion video portion which
will be adaptively interpolated. For example, the stationary video portion is substituted
by the mean value of
