<ABSTRACT>
A new treatment schedule for administration of N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide and other related carboxamide anticancer drugs in which the drug is administered in a divided-dose shedule comprising two or more administrations at frequent intervals, for example every hour. Schedules to produce cyclic peaks/troughs in plasma levels are mentioned. The compounds can be used for circumventing multidrug resistance in cancers and may, for example, be used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, especially non-topo II inhibitors. Treatment of melanoma and advanced colon cancer is included.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of
tumours, especially to the treatment of melanoma and
cancer of the colon, and to the circumvention of
multidrug resistance in cancer treatments.For certain types of cancer, chemotherapy has been
capable of rendering patients with responsive tumours
free of disease. However, this responsive category does
not include the most frequently encountered forms of
malignant tumours.The most common types of cancer in western populations
are colon, lung and breast cancer. Each of these
can be treated to some extent with existing chemotherapy,
with different drugs being used preferentially for each
type of malignancy (for instance, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide
and methotrexate for breast cancer, 5-fluorouracil
for colon cancer), but response rates are not
good. In addition, melanoma is a disease which is
increasing in incidence at an alarming rate among fair-skinned
populations. In melanoma, only 25-30% of
patients with disseminated disease respond to treatment,
and only 5-10% sustain durable remission (Evans B.D., et
al., Proc. Am. Soc. din. Oncol. 1990, 9, 276).There is therefore a great need for new types of
cancer therapy, and a desperate need for such treatments
for the above cancers in particular. The basis for the development of the majority of
anticancer drugs used today has been a panel of mouse
tumours including transplantable leukaemias, the Lewis
lung carcinoma and the colon 38 adenocarcinoma. A number
of human tumour xenografts in mice have also been used.
In general, the leukaemias are the most sensitive to
experimental agents, the xenografts are the most resistant
and the Lewis lung and colon 38 are of intermediate
sensitivity (Goldin A., et al., Eur. J. Cancer 1981, 17,
129-142).The murine Lewis lung adenocarcinoma is a tumour
which initially arose spontaneously in C57Bl mice and
which has a number of features which make it a good model
for clinical carcinomas. It grows easily both invitro
and invivo, and is aneuploid, heterogeneous, metastatic
and resistant to many but not all clinical antitumour
agents. Zacharski (Zacharski L.R., Haemostasis 1986,
16, 300-320) has concluded that although Lewis lung has
the cytological appearance of a large-cell cancer, its
rapid rate of growth, propensity to cause lethal metastases,
as well as its susceptibility to combination
chemotherapy, radiation and anticoagulant treatment, make
it a good model for human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
The colon 38 tumour arose in carcinogen-treated mice, and
because it is
