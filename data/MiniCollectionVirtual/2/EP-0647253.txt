<DESCRIPTION>
Fluoroelastomers based on vinylidene 
fluoride (VF2), such as copolymers with 
hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and tetrafluoroethylene 
(TFE), are well-known materials which have a unique 
combination of properties. Their high chemical, 
thermal and oxidative stability give them high value 
in the marketplace. While these elastomers have many 
desirable properties, their low temperature 
flexibility is not adequate for all low temperature 
applications. There has been considerable effort to 
improve the low temperature flexibility of these 
elastomers. It is known that the low temperature 
flexibility, as measured by the glass transition 
temperature (Tg), of VF2/HFP/TFE copolymers varies 
inversely with the VF2 content of the copolymer. 
However, increasing the VF2 content of these 
copolymers is not always desirable, since their 
chemical resistance becomes poorer as the VF2 content 
is raised. Another method for improving the low 
temperature flexibility of VF2 elastomers is to 
substitute perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ethers) for the HFP 
in VF2/HFP/TFE copolymers. For example, when 
perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) (PMVE) is substituted 
for HFP, the resulting VF2/PMVE/TFE copolymers have 
Tg's which are 10 to 20C° lower than those of the 
corresponding VF2/HFP/TFE copolymers. While this is a 
good method for improving the low temperature 
flexibility of VF2 fluoroelastomers, the cost of 
copolymers containing perfluoro (alkyl vinyl ethers) 
is much higher than that of conventional VF2/HFP/TFE 
copolymers.  
 Representative of previously known polymers which fail to 
provide the desired combination of elastomeric characteristics and low 
temperature properties include: 
US, A,4 243 770 (M. TATEMOTO ET AL.) DE,A,4 023 657 (NIPPON MEKTRON, LTD) US,A4 949 852 (A. L. MOORE) EP,A,0 361 506 (DAIKIN IND., LTD) EP,A,0 045 070 (DAIKIN KOGYO CO., LTD) EP,A,0 206 126 (AUSIMONT S. P. A.) The present invention provides a method of improving the low 
temperature properties of both VF2/HFP/TFE and VF2/PMVE/TFE copolymes, 
without depreciation of the other beneficial properties of these copolymers. Specifically, the present invention provides a cured

units, 12-24 mole % CF3(CF2)n OCF=CF2 polymer repeat
