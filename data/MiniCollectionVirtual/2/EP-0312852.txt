<ABSTRACT>
A radially expandable vascular stent of the type formed of wire wound 
generally in a helix. Bends are provided in the wire outside its helical 

path which straightens as the stent is expanded. The stent preferably 
is made of a low memory metal such as copper alloy, titanium, or gold, 

and provides a radial support from within a blood vessel after implan­
tation therein. The stent is ada
pted to act as a permanent prosthesis 
to assure vascular patency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radially expandable vascular stent of the 
type formed of wire wound generally in a helix. In US-A-4649922 a device is described in combination with a catheter 
which is basically a compression spring retained between a partially inflated 
balloon and an abuttment immediately behind the balloon on the 
catheter shaft. The intent is to transport the spring prosthesis in this 
manner to the desired location and then after a successful angioplasty 
procedure release said spring prosthesis by totally evacuating said 
balloon, thus allowing said spring prosthesis to expand linearly and 
stay in place while the balloon catheter is withdrawn. This method is 
quite simple and its simplicity is very attractive; however it has some 
drawbacks. One disavantage is the fact that the spring has a fixed 
diameter and as such is unable to fully conform to the inside wall of the 
vessel which at times is quite tortuous and thus could conceivably create 
a somewhat turbulant flow of blood, and possible thrombosis could in some 
cases result. Other patents, e.g. US-A-4553545 on which the preamble of 
claim 1 is based, teach a different design 
where a relatively complex mechanical rotating device and co-axial 
cables are employed to achieve the necessary means to change the diameter 
of the implanted stent to a larger dimension at the point of implant. 
Still other patents, e.g. US-A-3868956, describe a design 
wherein a temperature responsive metallic device is used and expanded 
after implant using external heat sources. All of the above mentioned 
devices present drawbacks of various magnitudes including blood coagulation 
and possible thrombosis, and considerable complexity of procedure. Other reference publications are:1."Self-expanding metallic stents for small vessels",
