production apparatus marking engine (30) having a media 
positioning system driven by a motor, includes a 

motion control loop to control the motor; a sensor 
adapted to detect the position of the media and to 

create a trigonometric signal characteristic of the 
position of the media, the trigonometric signal 

comprising frequency and phase components; a 
resolver electronics subsystem adapted to 

trigonometrically process the trigonometric signal 
to create a resolved signal; and means for comparing 

the resolved signal to a reference clock signal of 
predetermined frequency and phase to provide an 

error signal used to control the motor that drives 
the media positioning system. The trigonometric 

signal may include a sine portion and a cosine

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to document 
production apparatus such as copiers, printers, and 
other marking engines having the need to transport 
media with high position and velocity control to 
maximize the registration accuracy of the media, 
thereby insuring the quality of the document. Document production apparatus such as copiers, 
printers, and other marking engines use a variety of 
methods for moving media so that images can be 
transferred onto hard copy output paper or 
transparency media. For example, color thermal 
printers use a media transport control system to 
move media (receiver webs and sheets) beneath a 
thermal print head. In color printers, the quality of the final 
print image is directly related to the registration 
accuracy of the successive color planes on the final 
print. Therefore, media transport systems for color 
printers are designed to very accurately control the 
position and velocity of the media so as to maximize 
the ability to print two or more successive color 
planes in a highly registered fashion. Accurate position and velocity control is 
especially difficult in thermal printers because the 
required media velocities are generally very low 
relative to other types of document production 
apparatus. Therefore, designers have long attempted 
to employ methods for enhancing the position and 
velocity control of the media. Such methods have 
ranged from simple to exotic. For example, a simple  
 
method might include the use of a stepper motor with 
a speed reduction transmission system to drive a 
rotating drum or roller; while an exotic method 
might include a closed loop feedback system to 
control a DC motor that powers a drum or roller. One such closed loop feedback system is shown 
in Figure 1, wherein a computer-generated desired-position 
command is compared with a trigonometric 
signal (explained below) by a digital comparator 10. 
The difference signal is converted to analog form at 
12 and input to a compensation network 14 for 
filtering. The filtered signal is amplified at 16 
and used to drive a DC motor 18 for positioning the 
media via, say, a rotating drum or roller. The 
media position is detected by a digital position 
sensor 20, which creates the trigonometric signal 
which was referred to above as one of the inputs to 
comparator 10. While motion control loops such as shown in 
Figure 1 are widely used, they have the disadvantage 
of requiring many performance tradeoffs, depending 
on the designer's choice of subsystems. For 
example,
