<ABSTRACT>
Method for storing and/or transporting fresh goods (1), for example fruit and vegetables, in which a closeable wrapping, bag or sack (8), for example of plastic sheeting material, is filled with fresh goods, in which the bag or sack is then closed and sealed, in which a gas mixture which inhibits the decay of the fresh goods is introduced into the inside of the bag/sack via a first place (16) on the bag and in which the air and gas driven out of the bag pass out via a second place (17) and in which the gas mixture is continuously fed into the bag/sack during storage by means of external supply (21, 19) to the stated first place (16) and evacuated from the stated second place (17) and/or that the bag is sealed during transportation at the stated first and second places.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for storing and/or transporting fresh 
goods, for example fruit and vegetables. Previous arrangements are known in which large storerooms are used for storing 
fresh goods, where a gas mixture, containing, for example, nitrogen and oxygen 
to inhibit the decay of the fresh goods, such as fruit and vegetables, is introduced 
into the storeroom under controlled conditions. These solutions, however, 
require specially designed premises and that the persons operating the system, 
and who may enter the storeroom, have sufficient protective equipment. When such fresh goods are to be removed from the storeroom, the crates which 
contain the fresh goods are transported out of the storeroom by means of 
transportation pallets and are placed in transportation vehicles which may be 
equipped with a common refrigeration aggregate. Furthermore, it is known that both natural and unnatural wastage occurs during 
the storage and transportation of fresh goods. The natural wastage is due to 
deterioration of the fresh goods during storage, if any, at the producer, 
transportation from the producer to the wholesaler, storage at the wholesaler and 
transportation to the retailer. The unnatural wastage is due to theft of goods  
 
during storage and transportation. The overall wastage is very large for some 
types of goods which also has an effect on the sales price at the retailer. According to U.S. patent no. 4,055,931, devices for storing fruits in a protective 
atmosphere or for providing a protective atmosphere with trucks and box cars 
are known. These devices utilise a purge technique, to replace the air 
atmosphere within the container with the desired atmosphere. The desired 
atmosphere flows into the container and the displaced atmosphere is vented out 
of the container. Thus, there is a continuous mixing and dilution of the 
atmosphere within the container, until the original air is almost totally expelled. 
Because of the mixing of the atmosphere, this known method is costly, is 
inefficient, is wasteful of the purging gas, and requires a long time to expel the 
original atmosphere. U.S. patent no. 4,055,931 further describes an apparatus for protecting 
perishable products comprising a flexible bag for enclosing said product, a probe 
for insertion into said bag after the bag is sealed, and a hose connecting said 
probe to a multi-positioned valve. Means for evacuating the air within the bag 
including a vacuum pump, and means for introducing a gas into the bag, both

<CLAIMS>
Device for storing and/or transporting fresh goods, comprising a closeable 
wrapping being filled with or arranged around the fresh goods, having a 

first and a second place (16, 17) for respectively introduction and 
evacuation of gas into and from the wrapping, and comprising 

closeable coupling nozzle 
pipes having a pointed tube-shaped part (22) with perforations (23) fastened to a 

flange coupling (24) with an outer coupling part (25), wherein the flange 
couplings (24) are fixed to the wrapping at the first and second place (16, 

17) for introduction and evacuation of gas. 
Device according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 the flange couplings (24) are fixed to the 
wrapping by means of welding or gluing. 
Device according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 the coupling part (25) is constituted by 
a female or a male part of a quick-action coupling, for example a bayonet 

coupling.
