<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a gas lighter. To use the gas lighter, a push-down member (6) 
is depressed. As a result, a rotary body (13) rotates and an engage pawl (17) of the rotary 

body (13) engages with ratchet teeth (18) of a ratchet (12). This rotates the ratchet (12), 
causing a rotary ignition means (10) to rotate. As the rotary ignition means (10) rotates, 

it rubs against a flint (5) to make sparks, which ignite gas ejected from a gas ejection 
means (2). To stop using the gas lighter, the depression of the push-down member (6) is 

released. Consequently, the push-down member (6) returns by a returning elastic member 
(25) so that the rotary body (13) rotates in the opposite direction, thus disengaging the 

engage pawl (17) from the ratchet teeth (18). At this time, the ratchet teeth (18) and 
rotary ignition means (10) do not rotate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas lighter, and, more particularly, to a gas 
lighter in which the structure for rotating a rotary ignition means, such as a rotary file, is 
improved, and which is easy to manufacture and can easily be designed compactly, and 
has improved ignition efficiency. A conventional flint type gas lighter is designed as follows. The gas lighter has a 
lighter body with a gas ejection nozzle provided at the upper portion of the lighter body, 
and a rotary file which has a file face on its outer surface and is rotatably attached at the 
upper portion of the lighter body. A flint is placed inside the lighter body and is urged by 
a spring to elastically abut the rotary file. An actuator for rotating the rotary file is 
attached to the upper portion of the lighter body. One side of the rotary file is provided 
with segment portions that are equally divided (eg. into fifths), with an engage step 
portion formed in each segment portion. A spring piece having engage pawls, which are 
detachably engaged with the engage step portions of the segment portions, in provided on 
the actuator side. To use the gas lighter with the above structure, first, the actuator is pressed down. 
The depression of the actuator causes the engage pawls of the spring piece to engage the 
engage step portion of any one of the segment portions, thus rotating the rotary file. As 
the rotary file rotates, it rubs against the flint that is pressed against the file face to make 
sparks. The sparks ignite gas ejected from the nozzle. As mentioned above, the structure for rotating the rotary file in the conventional 
gas lighter requires the segment portions to be formed on one side of the rotary file with 
the engage step portion formed on each segment portion, and the spring piece to have the 
engage pawls on the actuator side. It is however difficult to form the segment portions. 
In manufacturing the rotary file, for example, a metal wire is cut to a predetermined length 
and the cut wire pieces are pressed into a mould to be cast. Thus, to provide the  
 
mentioned segment portions, it is necessary to form the equivalent shapes in the mould. 
The manufacture of the rotary file including the preparation of such a mould is very 
difficult. The production of the conventional gas lighter therefore needs many steps, 
resulting in a high manufacturing cost. Further, the number of segment portions is limited to about five because the shape 
of the aforementioned mould would become complex to ensure finer

<CLAIMS>
A gas lighter comprising: 
   a lighter body (1) for retaining liquid gas and provided with gas ejection means 

(2); 
   a push-down member (6) attached to said lighter body (1), the push-down member 

being movable between a rest position and depressed position, and urged in a direction 
opposite to the depressing direction by a returning elastic member (25); 

   rotary ignition means (4) rotatably attached to said lighter body (1), with a flint (5) 
elastically abutting said rotary ignition means (4), said rotary ignition means (4) rubbing 

against said flint (5) when being rotated; 
   a ratchet (12) attached coaxially to said rotary ignition means (4) and having a 

plurality of ratchet teeth (18); and 
   a rotary body (13) attached to said ratchet (12) coaxially and rotatably and having 

an engage pawl (17), said rotary body (13) being rotatable as a result of depression of 
said push-down member (6) to permit said engage pawl (17) to engage with said ratchet 

teeth (18) of said ratchet (12), thereby rotating said ratchet (12) and said rotary ignition 
means (4) to cause sparks between the rotary ignition means (4) and flint (5) to ignite gas 

ejected from the gas ejection means (2), said rotary body (13) being rotatable in an 
opposite direction as a result of release of said push-down member (6) and disengagement 

of the engage pawl (17) from said ratchet teeth (18). 
A gas lighter as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said rotary ignition means (4), said 
ratchet (12) and said rotary body (13) are covered with a cover (16) adapted to rotate by 

depression of said push-down member (6) and thus rotate said rotary body (13). 
A gas lighter as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein said rotary body (12) has a 
pair of engage pawls (17) symmetrically opposite. 
A gas lighter as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the engage pawls (17) are engaged 
with symmetrically opposite ratchet teeth (18). 
A gas lighter as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein a driving 
elastic member (29) is located in a push-down member (28) such that said driving elastic 

member (29) is compressed but rotation of said rotary body (13) is restricted despite part-depression 
of said push-down member (28), and compression of said driving elastic 

member (29) is released to rotate said rotary body (13) after said push-down member (28) 
is depressed by a predetermined amount. 
A gas lighter as claimed in Claim 5 wherein a movable member (31) is linked to 
said rotary body (13) to receive the biasing force of said driving elastic member (29) and 

is retained movable in said push-down member (28), depression of said push-down 
member (28) compresses said driving elastic member (29) but movement of said movable 

member (31) is restricted due to an engagement with said push-down member (28), and 
when said push-down member (28) is depressed by a predetermined amount, said 

movable member (31) is disengaged from said push-down member (28) to permit said 
movable member (31) to move, thereby rotating said rotary body (13). 
A gas lighter as claimed in Claim 5, wherein a movable member (45) is linked to 
said rotary body (13) to receive the biasing force of a driving elastic member (49) and is 

retained movable in a push-down member (48), depression of said push-down member 
(48) compresses said driving elastic member (49) but movement of said movable member 

(45) is restricted due to an engagement of said movable member (45) with a slide member 
(51) disposed transversely thereagainst, and when said push-down member (41) is 

depressed by a predetermined amount, said push-down member (41) disengages said 
movable member (45) from said slide member (51) and the biasing force of said driving 

elastic member (49) moves said movable member (45) to rotate said rotary body (13).
