<DESCRIPTION>
 MEDICAMENT FOR PROMOTING GROWTH OF MAMALIAN NERVEBackground of the inventionThis application relates to nerve regeneration by the administration of growth factors.Growth factors are polypeptide hormones which stimulate a defined population of target cells. Examples of growth factors are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) , insulin-like growth factors (IGF's) , transforming growth factors beta (TGF-β) , and alpha (TGF-α) , epidermal growth factor (EGF) , acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) , basic FGF(bFGF) , and nerve growth factor (NGF) .The application of a combination of PDGF and IGF-I or PDGF and IGF-II in wound healing and bone regeneration has been described (Lynch et al, 1987, Proc. Nat'1. Acad. Sci. USA. 84:7696 - 7700; Lynch et al, 1989, J. Clin. Invest. 84:640-646,-Lynch et al, 1989, J. Clin. Periodontol. 16:545-588; Lynch et al, 1991, J. Periodontol:62:458-467. US Patents No. 4,861,757 and 5,019,559, hereby incorporated by reference).IGF's, or somatomedins, are polypeptides of about 7.5 KD that have a strong homology to human proinsulin (Hu bel, 1984 in Hormonal Proteins and Peptides 12:pp57- 79) . IGF-I and II share a 62% sequence homology. Their actions are mediated through two distinct receptors. The IGF-I receptor is named type-I receptor (IGF-IR) , and the IGF-II receptor is named type-II receptor (IGF-IIR) . The IGF-IR is a transmembrane protein structurally related to the insulin receptor (Ullrich et al, 1986 EMBO J. 5:2503- 2512) . It contains an extracellular binding domain consisting of two α-subunits and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain consisting of two β-subunits. The type-I receptor has a high affinity for IGF-I and a lower affinity for IGF-II and insulin. The type II receptor is distinct from the IGF-I and insulin receptors (Morgan et al, 1987 Nature 329:301-307). It has a high affinity for IGF-II, a low affinity for IGF-I and it does 

 not bind insulin. It is a transmembrane protein with a large extracellular binding domain and it does not seem to process tyrosine kinase activity. Its primary sequence is identical to that of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Morgan et al, 1987 ibid). In addition to IGF-I and IGF-II, a truncated form of IGF- I has been obtained from brain and was named IGF-III (Sara et al, 1986; Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. : USA; 83:4904- 4907) . IGF-III is lacking the three amino-terminal amino acid residues of IGF-I, but it retains functional properties similar to those of IGF-I. In vitro, IGF's exert diverse metabolic activities
