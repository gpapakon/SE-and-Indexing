<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multi-layer sheet (film) which permits a coloured design of characters and pictorial markings by means of a laser beam. Sheets which have been written on in this way are preferably used as labels. The object of the invention is to create a multi-layer sheet which can be written on by means of a laser beam, has a simple structure and permits a label to be designed using coloured characters and pictorial markings. The invention achieves this object by means of a multi-layer sheet which can be written on by a laser beam and in which there is located beneath a cover layer (1), which consists of an aluminium substrate and which can be thermally and locally removed by means of a laser beam, a second layer which may have any colour and which does not absorb the laser beam used.
