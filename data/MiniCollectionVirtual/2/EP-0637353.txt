<ABSTRACT>
The equipment comprises a suction mould (1) having a plate (2) with perforations (5) and a covering of wire gauze (6). A number of projections (8) in the form of hollow members (9) of plastic, e.g. high-density polyethylene, are secured on top of suitable openings (7) in the plate (2) and the wire gauze (6). The hollow members (9) are perforated (11) and covered with wire gauze (10) on the outside, and they are selected from a first modular system comprising a relatively small number of types of pre-fabricated projections (8) with different dimensions and shapes. The equipment can also comprise a pressing mould (not shown) for hot-pressing of a papier-mâché product made by using the suction mould, said pressing mould comprising a first mould part with projections complementary to and having the same dimensions and shape as the recesses in the papier-mâché product produced by the projections on the suction mould, and a second mould part with recesses complementary to the projections on the first mould part, but having dimensions larger than the latter by the thickness of the hot-pressed papier-mâché product. The projections of the first mould part are pre-fabricated and selected from a second modular system comprising a relatively small number of types with different dimensions and shapes, after shrinkage corresponding to the dimensions of the recesses produced in the papier-mâché product using projections according to the said first modular system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to equipment of the 
kind set forth in the preamble of claim 1. Pulp moulding dies of this kind for the production of 
egg flats or fruit packaging trays are e.g. known from GB-A-708393 
and US-A-2903062 which solved a problem inherent to 
earlier pulp moulding dies, namely the undue stretching or 
distortion of the wire mesh. The manufacture of such a die 
or mould necessitates, however, extensive machining for the 
shaping of both the base surface and the individual projections, 
and the die or mould is therefore costly to manufacture 
and may only be used profitably when producing extremely 
great numbers of articles such as the aforesaid egg flats 
or fruit packaging trays. Recently, the need has arisen for also being able to 
make smaller series of articles, e.g. thin-walled papier--mâché 
products of pulp material with raised portions or 
projections to be used as shock-absorbing filling bodies 
instead of moulded filling bodies of rigid porous plastic 
material between an external packaging means, e.g. a corrugated-paper 
box, and an article packaged therein, such as 
an electronic apparatus, a kitchen machine etc., said projections 
or raised portions necessarily having various shapes 
and sizes and being located in a manner corresponding to 
the article to be packaged. On the above background, it is the object of the 
present invention to provide equipment of the kind referred 
to initially, with which it is possible to fill the need 
mentioned above, and which can be produced at such low cost,  
 
that it makes it possible in a profitable manner to produce 
limited numbers of thin-walled or shell-shaped products of 
pulp material. This object is achieved with equipment, according 
to the present invention being characterized by the features 
set forth in the characterizing clause of claim 1. With this arrangement, it is possible to assemble a 
suction mould with the desired raised portions or projections 
from a small number of standardized and series-produced components, 
which may in certain cases be used again, and the 
base surface may be made from e.g. a sheet metal where all 
the machining needed is the provision of perforations and 
openings, so that the suction mould can be produced at substantially 
reduced cost. A preferred embodiment for the equipment according 
to the invention is set forth in claim 2. Another embodiment of the equipment according to 
the invention is set forth in claim 3. The use of stainless 
steel makes the components concerned easy
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Equipment for making a thin-walled papier-mâché 
product from pulp material and comprising a suction mould (1) 

with flushing edges (3) and a shaping surface having projections 
(8) and covered with wire gauze (6,10), said projections 

having a suitable taper permitting problem-free 
liberation of the moulded product from the suction mould, 

wherein 

a) the suction mould (1) comprises a base surface (2) provided 
with perforations (5) and covered by wire gauze, and 

wherein 
b) the projections (8) are releasably secured (12) to the 
plate (2) above suitable openings (7) in the latter and in 

the wire gauze (6) and consist of perforated hollow members 
(9) covered on the outside with wire gauze (10), 
characterized 
in
 that said base surface is a plane plate (2) 
and that said projections (8) are selected from a first 

building-set system comprising a relatively small number of 
types of pre-fabricated projections (8) with different dimensions 

and shapes. 
Equipment according to claim 1, 
characterized in
