<ABSTRACT>
A method for using atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and/or migration enhanced epitaxy (MEE) to grow high efficiency quantum wells in II-VI laser diodes. The substrate and previously grown layers of the laser diode are heated to a temperature less than or equal to about 200 DEG C in an MBE chamber. Sources of Cd, Zn, and Se are injected alternately into the chamber to grow a short-period strained-layer superlattice (SPSLS) quantum well layer including overlaying monolayers of Cd, Zn and Se. The quantum well layer is described by the notation [(CdSe)m(ZnSe)n]p where m, n and p are integers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Research undertaken by 3M in St. Paul, Minnesota,
culminated in the demonstration of the world's first laser
diodes fabricated from II-VI semiconductor materials. These
devices emit coherent radiation at 490nm in the blue-green
portion of the spectrum. They are disclosed generally in
Haase et al. article, Short Wavelength II-VI Laser Diodes,
Conference Proceedings for Gallium Arsenide and Related
Compounds, 1991 Institute of Physics Conference Series, No.
120, pp 9-16.The light-generating (active) layers in the above-described
laser diodes include strained CdxZn1-xSe single
quantum wells grown by conventional molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) techniques. Unfortunately, the composition and
thickness of the random CdZnSe alloy is difficult to control
by this process. Luminescence efficiency is also relatively
poor. These characteristics limit the overall efficiency of
the devices.Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol. 101, No. 1-4, 1 April
1991, pp. 81-85 discloses a method for operating an MBE
system to grow a quantum well active layer on a substrate
and the manufacture of photoluminescent II-VI structures.
Similarly, EP-A-0 284 031 discloses MBE growth methods.It is evident that there is a continuing need for
improved laser diodes. For wide spread commercial viability,
the devices must be capable of efficiently generating high
intensity beams of light at room temperatures. Fabrication
techniques for laser diodes having these characteristics are
also needed.The invention as defined in claims 1 and 2 relates to a quantum well compound
semiconductor electroluminescent device and to a method of making thereof.
Claims 15 and 16 relate to the use of such a device in a laser diode and, respectively,
to an electronic system including such a device emitting in the blue and/or green
portions of the spectrum. In
one embodiment, the substrate and previously grown
layers of the device are heated to a temperature of
about 150°C, while Cd, Zn and Se are injected
alternately into the chamber to produce a laser diode
active layer including a CdSe/ZnSe short-period
strained-layer superlattice (SPSLS) quantum well layer
described by the notation [(CdSe)1(ZnSe)2]3. Prototypes
of laser diodes fabricated through the use of this
technique exhibit greater room temperature
photoluminescence and electroluminescence intensities
than those described in the Background of the Invention
section, yet operate at lower threshold currents.
