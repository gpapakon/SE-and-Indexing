<ABSTRACT>
A digital audio signal is compressed, converted to serial, passed to a quadrature phase modulator (101) and transmitted to a receiver (RX), attached to a loudspeaker (HP). Serial conversion adds protocol information, destination address, loudspeaker control information, and encryption key. The receiver checks the packet address and carries out decryption if it matches its own.

<CLAIMS>
Wireless digital transmission system for loudspeakers comprising:

means for compressing the file representing the audio digital signal of
the "Compact disc" type, a transmission device comprising means for

transforming this compressed signal into a serial signal circulating in
packets going to a phase-quadrature modulator circuit, and means for

transmitting the signals leaving the phase-quadrature modulator
circuit to the domestic electrical supply network;
a reception device comprising means for connecting to this domestic
network and extracting from the electrical supply signal, using a

phase-quadrature demodulator, the packets of information conveying
the audio digital signal, transformation means for the packets of

information in order to transform them into a parallelised digital signal
sent to a decompression circuit;
means for transforming the decompressed digital signals into an
analogue signal intended to supply a loudspeaker after suitable

amplification.
Wireless digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim
1, 
characterised in that
 the serialisation means comprise means for
inserting a destination address into the packets of serialised signals;

and 
in that
 the reception means comprise means for comparing the
address shown in the received packet with the address specific to the

reception device to which the loudspeaker is connected.
Wireless digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim
1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the serialisation device comprises means for
multiplexing several frames of digital files representing a different audio

signal to different addresses. 
Wireless digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim
1, 
characterised in that
 the transmission circuits comprise an encryption
circuit and the connected reception device comprises a decryption circuit

using a secret key stored in the memory of the deserialisation circuit.
Digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the information from the digital signal is serialised
according to a protocol comprising a first part (IP) constituting protocol

information, a second part (AD) constituting the address of the recipient,
a third part (SNA) constituting the digital signal or the multiplexed digital

signals, and a fourth part (IFP) constituting end-of-protocol information.
Digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim 5,

characterised in that
 the protocol comprises a fifth part (IC) constituting
control information for the loudspeakers.
Digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim 5,

characterised in that
 the protocol comprises a sixth part (CE) constituting
at least one encryption key.
Digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 it comprises means for including control commands
permitting individual adjustment of each loudspeaker, in the serial signal

circulating by packet.
Digital transmission system for loudspeakers according to Claim 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 it includes means for converting an analogue signal
into a digital signal, arranged upstream of the compression means for

the file representing the audio signal, when the audio signal to be
transmitted is of the analogue type.
