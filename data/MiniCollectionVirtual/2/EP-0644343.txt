<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a roller bearing comprising 
a cage (3) with a seal (5,6) attached thereto. The cage (3) and the seal 

(5,6) possess different material properties, adapted to the function 
they perform in a roller bearing. The seal (5,6) is more elastic 

than the material of the cage (3). According to a preferred embodiment 
these different material properties are achieved by 

cross-linking of the material of the cage and/or seal by 
radiation. The invention further relates to a method of manufacturing 

such a bearing and a cage with an attached seal for 
such a bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller bearing 
comprising two race rings with rotating bodies between them 
which are held in position by a cage having recesses for the 
individual rotating bodies, which cage is fitted with a seal 
sealing the space between the race rings and around the rotating 
bodies. Such a roller bearing is known from the British 
patent application 2 115 889. This application describes a 
cage for a conical needle or roller bearing, whereby the cage 
is provided with tag members. These tag members extend circumferentially 
from the cage, whereby these tag members are 
present on the inside as well as the outside of the cage and 
their ends cooperate with shoulders of the race rings. This 
gives the tag members in the roller bearing a centering and 
sealing effect. The cage with sealing tag members is integrally 
made from plastic. The type of roller bearing described above has the 
disadvantage that the sealing tag members and the cage are of 
equal hardness, so that the sealing effect of the tag members 
is not satisfactory. It is the object of the present invention to provide 
an improved roller bearing in which the above disadvantage is 
removed. According to the invention this objective is achieved 
with a roller bearing of the kind mentioned in the preamble, 
which is characterized in that the material of the cage and 
the material of the attached seal have different material 
properties and the material of the seal is more elastic than 
that of the cage. Said measures have made it possible that both the 
cage and the seal possess the material properties necessary 
for their function, the seal with its elasticity safeguarding 
a good sealing effect. According to one preferred embodiment of the roller 
bearing according to the invention, the various material 
properties are achieved because the material of the cage  
 
and/or the seal comprises thermoplastic polymer and the material 
is cross-linked by radiation. The different material 
properties can, for instance, be obtained by different degrees 
of cross-linking of the cage and sealing material. A roller bearing containing a cage and/or seal made 
from material comprising cross-linked, thermoplastic polymer 
can be used under high load. This load may so high that temperatures 
near or above the melting point of the thermoplastic 
polymer occur, however, without adverse effects on the roller 
bearing, such as damage or destruction. In a favourable embodiment the material of the cage 
and/or seal may contain a
