<ABSTRACT>
A stud welding device (1) with a stud holder (3) comprising a pointed region
(2) for holding a weld stud (4) and a device (5) designed as an insulating spacing

means with a rim (7). The pointed region (2) of the stud holder (3) always remains
behind the rim (7) of the spacing means thereby preventing electrical contact between

the pointed region (2) and a component (6). The stud welding device (1) is reduced in
size because it is formed without a support foot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is a stud welding device with a stud holder having a pointed region for holding a weld stud and a device for preventing an electrical contact between the pointed region of the stud holder and a component, the device being designed as an insulating cylindrical tube portion (5) which is arranged substantially annularly round the pointed region of the stud holder (3) and spaced thereof and has a rim, the pointed region of the stud holder always remaining behind the rim of the spacing means (see, for example, FR-A-2 190 563).Another stud welding device with the features of the preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-4 201 904. In the known stud welding device the device for preventing an electrical contact between the pointed region of the stud holder and a component, for example a car body panel, is achieved by a so-called support foot which basically produces the mechanical primary contact between the stud welding device and the component when the stud welding device moves towards the component in order to weld a stud. This support foot is conventionally applied adjacent to the stud holder and therefore considerably increases the overall size of the stud welding device also due to the fact that the stud holder is axially movable relative to the support foot. Owing to increasing automation it has become necessary to offer stud welding devices which are smaller in overall size but which have the same performance profile as stud welding devices with support foot.The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a stud welding device which is considerably smaller in overall size but without forfeiting technical properties of previous stud welding devices.This object is achieved by the stud welding device according to the invention with the features in accordance with claim 1.By removing the support foot in the stud welding device according to the invention it is achieved that only the diameter of the stud holder and optionally of the substantially cylindrically formed spacer located around it produce the maximum overall size of the stud welding device, so areas of application which conventionally could not be reached by stud welding devices with support foot can be penetrated with the stud welding device according to the invention.Whilst it is possible to reduce the overall component size of a stud welding device simply by omitting the support foot, omission of the support foot runs the considerable risk that the pointed region of the stud holder is placed on the

<CLAIMS>
Stud welding device (1) with a stud holder (3) having a pointed region (2) for holding a weld stud (4), and a device for preventing an electrical contact between the pointed region (2) of the stud holder (3) and a component (6), the device being designed as an insulating cylindrical tube portion (5) which is arranged substantially annularly round the pointed region of the stud holder (3) and spaced thereof and has a rim (7), the pointed region (2) of the stud holder (3) always remaining behind said rim (7), 
characterised in that
 the stud welding device (1) is formed without a support foot and that the insulating cylindrical tube portion (5) for preventing an electrical contact is securely connected to the stud holder.
