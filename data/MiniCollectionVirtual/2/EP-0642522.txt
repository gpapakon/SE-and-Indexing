<DESCRIPTION>
Glycoside surfactants have been known for at least
sixty years. They are nonionic surfactants with low
toxicity and gentleness to the skin. They can be made from
renewable resources and are rapidly degraded in the
environment.In spite of the excellent properties of the glycoside
surfactants, they have not achieved great commercial
acceptance because of the difficulties encountered in their
production. Rohm & Haas Corporation has been providing
alkyl glycosides in which the alkyl group is formed from a
mixture of fatty alcohols having 8 and 10 carbon atoms.
The compositions are sold under the trade names BG-10 and
CG-110. The BG-10 composition is a dark, almost black
material and is used only in commercial formulations. The
CG-110 material is a light colored product useful for
consumer applications. Early processes for the preparation of glycoside
surfactants were two-step processes. The first step
comprised the reaction of a lower alcohol having 1 to 6
carbon atoms with a saccharide source in the presence of an
acid catalyst to form a glycoside. The glycosides prepared
from the lower alcohols did not have useful surfactant
properties. Since water is soluble in the alcohols, the
reaction mixture could contain a substantial quantity of
water (see U.S.-A-4,721,780). The higher glycoside
surfactants in which the organic group attached to the
glycoside moiety contains more than about 7 carbon atoms
are then prepared by transacetalization of the lower
glycoside with alcohols containing at least 7 carbon atoms
under substantially anhydrous conditions.More recently, aliphatic glycosides having aliphatic
groups with from 7 to 22 carbon atoms have been prepared by
a "direct process". In the "direct process" a long chain
fatty alcohol is reacted with a source of saccharide in the
presence of an acid catalyst under conditions in which the
water formed in the reaction is removed as quickly as it is
formed to maintain the water content of the reaction
mixture at as low a level as is reasonably possible. The
water formed in the reaction is only sparingly soluble in
the fatty alcohol and any undissolved water results in the
rapid formation of unwanted byproducts. The parameters of
the "direct process" with a less than ideal catalyst and
neutralization procedure are disclosed in U.S.-A-3,839,318.
Other patents 
such as U.S.-A-4,939,245, U.S.-A-4,950,743 and U.S.-A-5,003,057
also disclose the "direct process".The glycoside surfactants are formed by the reaction
of the alcohol having more, than about 7 carbon atoms and

<CLAIMS>
A method for reducing the content of fatty alcohol in

a mixture of fatty alcohol and fatty glycoside product
which comprises:


a) continuously introducing a mixture of fatty
alcohol and fatty glycoside product into a forced

circulation evaporation zone operated at a temperature
of from 140°C to 220°C and a pressure of

from 133.2 Pa to 13.32 kPa (1.0 millimeter Hg to 100 millimeters
Hg) to remove a portion of the fatty alcohol and

produce a mixture of fatty alcohol and fatty glycoside
product with reduced fatty alcohol content; and
b) directly passing the mixture of fatty alcohol
and fatty glycoside product with reduced fatty alcohol

content continuously from the forced circulation
evaporization zone into a wiped film evaporation zone

operated at a temperature of from 140°C to
240°C and a pressure of from 13.3 Pa to 11.999 kPa (0.1 millimeter Hg

to 90 millimeters Hg) to produce a fatty
glycoside product containing less than 5% by

weight of fatty alcohol.
A method of claim 1 wherein the fatty glycoside
product is an aliphatic glycoside having an aliphatic

moiety containing from 8 to 20 carbon
atoms. 
A process of claim 1 wherein the fatty glycoside
product contains less than 1% by weight of fatty

alcohol.
A process of claim 1 wherein the forced circulation
evaporation zone is maintained at a pressure in the

range of from 666 Pa to 2.666 kPa (5 millimeters Hg to 20
millimeters Hg) and a temperature of from 150 °C

to 175 °C.
A process of claim 1 wherein the fatty alcohol content
of the mixture of fatty alcohol and fatty glycoside

product entering the forced circulation evaporization
zone is in the range of from 50% by weight to

80% by weight.
A process of claim 1 wherein the mixture of fatty
alcohol and fatty glycoside product introduced into

the wiped film evaporation zone contains from
60% by weight to 10% by weight of fatty alcohol.
A process of claim 1 wherein the flow of the mixture
of fatty alcohol and fatty glycoside product with the

reduced fatty alcohol content into the wiped film
evaporation zone is controlled by a flow control

means.
A process of claim 1 wherein the fatty glycoside
product is an aliphatic glycoside having an aliphatic

moiety containing from 8 to 16 carbon
atoms.
A process of claim 1 wherein the fatty glycoside
product comprises an aliphatic glucoside.
