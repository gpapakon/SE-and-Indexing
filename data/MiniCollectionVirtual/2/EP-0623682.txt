<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for isothermal in vitro nucleic acid
amplification, and in particular to methods for assessing the amplification activity of a sample
or quantitating the amount of a target sequence present in a sample.In vitro nucleic acid amplification techniques have provided powerful tools for
detection and analysis of small amounts of nucleic acids. The extreme sensitivity of such
methods has lead to attempts to develop them for diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases.
Nucleic acid amplification techniques can be grouped according to the temperature
requirements of the procedure. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR; R. K. Saiki, et al. 1985.
Science230, 1350-1354) , ligase chain reaction (LCR; D. Y. Wu, et al. 1989. Genomics4,
560-569; K. Barringer, et al. 1990. Gene89, 117-122; F. Barany. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA88, 189-193) and transcription-based amplification (D. Y. Kwoh, et al. 1989.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA86, 1173-1177) require temperature cycling. In contrast,
methods such as strand displacement amplification (SDA; G. T. Walker, et al. 1992. Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA89, 392-396; G. T. Walker, et al. 1992. Nuc. Acids. Res.20, 1691-1696),
self-sustained sequence replication (3SR; J. C. Guatelli, et al. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA87, 1874-1878) and the QÎ² replicase system (P. M. Lizardi, et al. 1988.
BioTechnology6, 1197-1202) are isothermal reactions. In addition, WO 90/10064 and WO
91/03573 describe use of the bacteriophage phi29 replication origin for isothermal replication
of nucleic acids.In general, these nucleic acid amplification techniques have been used to produce
qualitative results in diagnostic assays. There is, however, a great deal of interest in
developing quantitative nucleic acid amplification methods and methods for determining the 
amplification activity (i.e., efficacy) of a sample. These capabilities would provide improved
reliability and precision to nucleic acid-based amplification diagnostic assays.Because, in many cases, nucleic acid amplification is an exponential process,
quantitation of the absolute amount of a specific target by coamplification of an internal
control sequence has been difficult. For this reason, small differences in the efficiency of
amplification of the control and target sequences can result in large differences in the yield of
amplification products and erroneous quantitative comparisons. Coamplification of internal
control sequences has been used in PCR to quantitate the amount of target sequence

A method for determining the amplification efficacy of a sample comprising:

a) coamplifying by isothermal amplification a known amount of an internal control
nucleotide sequence and a target nucleotide sequence, if present, the control sequence having

substantially the same length and substantially the same G+C content as the target sequence,
and;
b) determining the amplification efficacy of the sample by detecting amplification
of the internal control sequence.
The method of Claim 1 wherein a 
M. tuberculosis
 target sequence is coamplified with
an internal control sequence by strand displacement amplification.
The method of Claim 2 wherein a target sequence having the nucleotide sequence of
SEQ ID NO:2 is coamplified with an internal control sequence having the nucleotide sequence

of SEQ ID NO:1.
The method of Claim 3 wherein amplification is detected in a chemiluminescent assay.
The method of Claim 4 wherein amplification of the target sequence is detected using a
probe having SEQ ID NO:7 and amplification of the internal control sequence is detected

using a probe having SEQ ID NO:5.
A method for quantitating a pre-amplification amount of a target nucleotide sequence
in a sample comprising:


a) coamplifying, in an isothermal nucleic acid amplification reaction, a known pre-amplification
amount of an internal control nucleotide sequence and the target sequence, if

present, the internal control sequence having substantially the same length and substantially 
the same G+C content as the target sequence, such that a detectable amount of post-amplification

control sequence is produced;
b) determining the post-amplification amount of the control sequence and a post-amplification
amount of the target sequence, if present, and;
c) calculating a ratio of the post-amplification amount of the target sequence and
the post-amplification amount of the internal control sequence, and;
d) calculating the pre-amplification amount of the target nucleotide sequence
using the ratio and the pre-amplification amount of the internal control sequence.
The method of Claim 6 wherein a 
M. tuberculosis
 target sequence is coamplified with
the internal control sequence by strand displacement amplification.
The method of Claim 7 wherein a target sequence having the nucleotide sequence of
SEQ ID NO:2 is coamplified with an internal control sequence having the nucleotide sequence

of SEQ ID NO:1.
The method of Claim 8 wherein amplification is detected in a chemiluminescent assay.
The method of Claim 9 wherein amplification of the target sequence is detected using a
probe having SEQ ID NO:7 and amplification of the internal control sequence is detected

using a probe having SEQ ID NO:5.
