<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing titanium from a device is disclosed. The 
titanium is etched at a controllable rate. The etchant oxidizes the titanium, and the 

oxidized titanium forms a complex in the etchant. When the concentration of this 
complex in the etchant nears its solubility limit, it precipitates and forms a film on 

the titanium metal surface. This film reduces the rate of the etch, enabling the 
amount of titanium removed by the etchant to be controlle

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a process for etching titanium at a 
controllable rate. Devices such as multichip modules and hybrid integrated circuits are 
typically fabricated, in part, by depositing one or several layers of metal and/or 
polymer onto a substrate such as silicon or ceramic. Titanium metal is frequently 
used in the fabrication of devices to promote adhesion between the substrate and a 
metal layer, between the substrate and a polymer layer, or between a metal layer and 
a polymer layer. The titanium layer is patterned during the fabrication of these devices by 
forming a patterned polymer mask (denominated a resist mask) over the titanium 
layer and removing the regions of the titanium metal that are not covered by the 
resist. The exposed titanium metal is removed by immersing the substrate in an 
etchant such as aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF), or by spraying the etchant onto the 
substrate. HF etches through the native titanium oxide on the titanium surface in an 
amount of time that is sufficiently short to satisfy processing needs. However, the 
HF etches the titanium metal underlying the oxide at a much more rapid rate. Thus, 
an aqueous HF etchant that will etch through a thin layer of oxide (less than 100Å) 
in 5 or 10 seconds will etch through a 1000Å-thick titanium metal layer in less than 
one second. The patterns in these devices, i.e., the metallized line dimensions and the 
spaces between the lines, are becoming increasingly fine. Currently, lines and spaces 
are typically 150 microns on printed circuit boards, 50 to 100 microns on ceramic 
substrates for multichip modules, and less than 10 microns on silicon devices. Finer 
lines and spaces allow greater density of components and active elements. Aqueous HF etchants etch titanium isotropically. Therefore, regions of 
titanium that underlie a mask are susceptible to lateral attack from the etchant as the 
etch proceeds downward. This lateral component of the etch is referred to as 
undercut. As the linewidth becomes smaller, less undercut is advantageous. 
Therefore, especially when linewidths are small, it is desirable to terminate the etch 
as soon as the objectives of the etch are accomplished, i.e., the desired metal has 
been removed. However, it is extremely difficult to target the precise moment that 
the desired amount of metal has been removed, especially when the etch rate is rapid.  
 
Typically, the substrate is overetched to ensure that the requisite amount of metal is 
removed from the entire substrate. During

<CLAIMS>
A process for fabricating a device having a layer of titanium 
comprising: 

   contacting a titanium surface with an etchant comprising water, an acid 
and a salt, wherein the etchant oxidizes the titanium and induces film formation on 

the titanium layer and wherein the etchant oxidizes the titanium at a first rate before 
the film is deposited on the titanium surface and a second rate after the film is 

formed on the titanium surface. 
The process of claim 1 wherein a portion of the titanium layer is 
covered by a mask. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the etchant further comprises a polar 
organic solvent, which may have a dielectric constant of about 15 to about 50, and 

which may be selected from lower aliphatic alcohols and lower alkylene glycols, 
wherein lower is defined as containing 5 or less carbon atoms per molecule. 
The process of claim 3, wherein the lower aliphatic alcohol is 
methonol, and/or the lower alkylene glycol is ethylene glycol, or propylene glycol. 
The process of claim 3 wherein the concentration of polar organic 
solvent in the etching solution is about 20 volume percent to about 80 volume 

percent. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the salt is selected from metal halide

the etchant is significantly below the solubility limit of the titanium complex in the 

etchant, and removing the titanium metal at a second rate when the concentration of

the etchant, wherein the first rate is faster than the second rate.
