<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cigarette paper having a low 
total filler content, 20% by weight of the paper or less, a 

proportion of the filler being a filler capable of effecting 
visible sidestream smoke reduction. The basis weight of the 

paper is about 30 g m⁻² or more and the total weight of 
filler is not more than 8g/m². 
Smoking articles made with such papers provide a 
synergistic sidestream smoke component reduction when 

compared with control cigarettes. Papers according to the 
invention with the addition of various burn additives are 

also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a divisional application from
European Patent Application No. 90306819.5 filed on 21 June
1990.The invention the subject of the present application
relates to paper wrappers for wrapping smoking materials of
smoking material rods of smoking articles. Hereinafter such
wrappers are referred to as cigarette papers.It has previously been proposed in US Patent No.
4,231,377 to provide cigarette paper in which the basis weight
of the sheet is 50 g/m2 or greater comprising at least 15% magnesium
oxide, the purpose of such paper being to effect, in
comparison with a conventional cigarette paper, a reduction
in visible sidestream smoke. This cigarette paper has,
however, proved to be less than fully satisfactory. Thus,
for example, cigarettes incorporating the prior proposed
sidestream-smoke reducing paper were noticed by smokers to
exhibit a mainstream smoke off-taste and poor ash formation.It is an object of the subject invention to provide an
improved sidestream-smoke reducing cigarette paper.It is a further object of the subject invention to
provide an improved low sidestream smoke cigarette or similar
low sidestream smoke smoking article.The subject invention provides cigarette paper
comprising a total filler content of 20% by weight, or less,
a proportion at least of the filler being a visible
sidestream reducing filler, the weight of the paper being 
30g/m2, or more, and the maximum weight of total filler being
8g/m2.The subject invention also provides a smoking article
comprising a smoking material rod, which rod comprises
smoking material and a paper wrapper circumscribing said
smoking material, said paper of said paper wrapper comprising
a total filler content of 20% by weight, or less, a
proportion at least of the filler being a visible sidestream
reducing filler, the weight of the paper being a 30g/m2, or
more, and the maximum weight of total filler being 8g/m2.Preferably, the filler which effects a reduction in
visible sidestream is magnesium oxide and/or magnesium
hydroxide or high surface area chalk or mixtures thereof.
Magnesium oxide utilised for the purposes of the present
invention is preferably a reactive grade of magnesium oxide.
In addition to the visible sidestream reducing filler, the
filler may comprise conventional chalk. If conventional
chalk is present, it is preferably present in a range of
about twelve per cent by weight of the paper to about three
per cent by weight of the paper, and more preferably does not
constitute more than about ten per cent by weight of
