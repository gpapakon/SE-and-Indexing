<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (32) for automatically creating a simulated mosaic 
(Figs. 5a,5b,5c,12a,12b,13a-c,14a) controllably discharges tile 

pieces 
onto plate material (36) and secures the tile pieces in place 

such that the 
plates with the tile pieces are freestanding permitting the plates 

themselves 
to be an ordered arrangement of sections (Fig.16b) of the mosaic 

once 
cemented to the substrate. Many different forms may be had for 

the plate 
material, including ones that are pressure (Fig.20) or heat 

activatable (Fig.19) to bond with the tile 
pieces or ones that are mechanically 

connectable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system and related method
for creating art work using tile pieces and deals more particularly with an
automated tiling system whereby tilings are arranged in an ordered
collection of plates in accordance with numeric data representing a pattern to
be followed by the tile pieces such that the ordered collection of plates once
bonded to a substrate surface depict the pattern initially prescribed by the
input data.Hitherto, the creation of tile plates, that is, the pre-made
assembly of the tile pieces and the material backing on which they are
attached, were manufactured for the most part by hand. This involved the
time consuming process of hiring people to pick and place individual tile
pieces in a given arrangement on the plate material. The manual
arrangement of tilings on a backing material has without doubt many
problems associated with it, and among these problems is that the
complexity of the design to be carried out is limited by the skill of the worker.
Attempts have been made to simplify the creation of designs.One such attempt is disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,715,289 wherein
fabrication of repetitive or nonrepetitive designs is accomplished using plates
having a repeating pattern baked in them. The design is created by varying
the orientation of the individual plates relative to one another. A mosaic is
thus created by the juxtaposition of each plate with the other. However, the
tile pieces used are all of the same shape and size so that there is no
aesthetic enhancement through shape and size variances. Also, there is no
point-by-point color variation capability with this system, thus making it
virtually impossible to portray different designs outside of those which are
provided for by the system. With the advancement of new scanning technology, the ability
to take an image and transpose it into digital form for use in a computer is
readily available. The availability of such scanning technology presents
countless possibilities for decorating interiors and exteriors of an
environment. In addition, surfaces on commonly found items, such as
plazas, walkways, pool areas, coffee tables, dining tables, counter tops,
mantle pieces and wall hangings, could all be decorated in tile with exquisite
beauty using the data representing the design which is to be represented by
the tile pieces. In digital form, a desired design could be projected
electronically in a simulation of an environment in which it is to be used. That
is, data representing a graphic in digitized form
