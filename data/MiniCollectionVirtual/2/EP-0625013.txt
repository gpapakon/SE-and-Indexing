<ABSTRACT>
Inflatable footwear is disclosed in which an inflatable bag (25) under the foot is formed by two sheets of material welded together. Interior welds (28) are provided to moderate the thickness of the inflatable bag. A foam layer (62) having apertures (64) is positioned adjacent to the inflatable bag. The apertures (64) overlie the interior welds (28, 28') and are sized larger than the interior welds. Also described is a slide valve system (Fig. 11) which enables selective inflation of individual bladder chambers (32, 30).

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUPPORT SYSTEM FOR FOOTWEARBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention5 The present invention relates generally to footwear and more particularly to an under the foot support system which provides both improved shock absorption (cushioning) and support.2. Background10 The past decade has brought to the forefront the importance of exercise. Commensurate with the public awareness has been a flurry of activity in the development of footwear. One of the problems faced by the footwear industry relates to the physiological15 variances between people. Thus the requirements of footwear varies from person to person. The Running Shoe Book states, in discussing a study undertaken by the U.S. Army to determine the shape of soldier's feet, that *'[p]erhaps the most important finding from20 this massive survey is contained in the following stodgy 'Army-ese' conclusion: ' (to make a single last to fit all men) may not prove possible since it is evident that consistent or orderly schemes of dimensional inter-relationships applicable to all, or25 even a majority of men, probably do not exist. '"» In the last several years, Reebok International^ Ltd. , the assignee of the present invention, has been*■ successful in alleviating the problems associated with variations in foot shape by providing inflatable30 technology in the uppers of its shoes. The inflatable technology enables an individual user to custom fit his or her shoe by inflating the upper to fill in 

those gaps ordinarily present between the upper and the foot of a wearer. The Reebok inflatable technology, sold under the trademark THE PUMP utilizes a pair of thin sheets.of material. The sheets are radio frequency (rf) welded about their periphery to form a substantially air impervious pocket or bag. The sheets are also welded together interiorly to moderate the inflated thickness of the system at selective locations. For example, a series of weld lines or spots may be located in the tongue region of the shoe (where only a small gap is expected between the foot and the shoe) . The frequency of weld lines or spots is less in area where larger gaps are expected, for example around the malleoli of the wearer's foot.It has been known to utilize fluids (gas or liquid) in the sole of footwear. For example U.S. Patent No. 4,610,099 to Signori (the Signori patent) shows a shoe having an inflatable bladder in the sole. The Signori patent provides for the bladder to be inflated using a hypodermic needle insertion. While the device shown by
