<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed toward a cytology collection apparatus (10) and a method for preparing a uniform monolayer of cells. The apparatus allows the rapid preparation from body fluids of a cytology monolayer with very few overlapping cells and with fewer contaminants than prior devices. The apparatus is in the form of an openable cell collection container (10) which houses a filter (46) for collection of cells when body fluid passes therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus
and method for collecting a uniform layer of cells
from body fluids suitable for use in cytological
protocols.Diagnostic cytology, particularly in the area of
clinical pathology, bases diagnoses on a microscopic
examination of cells and other biological samples.
The accuracy of a diagnosis and the preparation of
optimally interpretable specimen slides may depend
both upon adequate patient sampling and on culture or 
slide preparation procedures.Prompt processing of urine to obtain fresh cells
traditionally has been recommended to ensure the
accuracy of quantitative culture results, urinalysis
and microscopy. Fresh cells tend to stick to a glass
slide much better than cells from preserved urine,
allowing for smoother cell spread onto the glass body.
Delays in processing, negligent care in either
inpatient or outpatient settings and lack of
refrigeration may lead to non-optimal slide
preparation. One known solution to the delay problem
is the use of chemical preservatives with the urine.
The presence of liquid preservatives, however, in the
urine specimen raises the specific gravity of the
specimen to unmeasurable levels and may limit the
potential usefulness of the urine for various types of
traditional quantitative analysis, such as slide
microscopy.A number of urine or other biological fluid
specimen containers have been developed to allow
liquid biological specimens to be tested without
removing the lid of the urine or biological fluid
container. U.S. Patent No. 3,904,482 discloses an apparatus
and method for the collection, cultivation and
identification of microorganisms obtained from bodily
fluids. The apparatus includes an evacuated tube
containing a culture medium, an inert gaseous
atmosphere and a vent-cap assembly. The tube
containing the culture medium is fitted with a stopper
for introduction of bodily fluid by means of a cannula
and, after growth of the organisms, transfer of the
cultured medium is completed for subculturing or
identification procedures.U.S. Patent No. 4,024,857 discloses a micro
device for collecting blood from an individual or
other blood source into a sampler cup. The cup has a
removable vented truncated cone-shaped top with a
capillary tube passing through a well formed in the
top, proximate to the inside wall of the cup to
deliver blood directly from the blood source to the
cup. None of the previously noted references solves
the problem of transferring cells in a uniform layer
to a slide for examination while at the same
