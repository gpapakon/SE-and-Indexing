<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic position control means for a cluster mill which has a two-part
pre-stressed housing in which the two parts are joined by hydraulic

cylinders and associated columns. It comprises an actuating means located
between the housings of the mill, so as to vary the relative separation or the

relative orientation or both of the two halves of the housing during rolling.
The actuating means includes at least one hydraulic lifting ram disposed

substantially between the two halves of the housing, and ideally four
hydraulic lifting rams each ram disposed at the corner position of a

rectangular housing. The hydraulic lifting rams are of the doughnut type,
encompassing each of the hydraulic cylinder's columns. The dynamic

position control means includes position monitoring means, in particular,
four position transducers mounted between the four respective corners of

the housings. Control means then adjust the actuating means in response to
the position monitoring means or other measured data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cluster mills, in particular, the
controlling of the position of the rolls presented to the strip.The type of cluster mill commonly known as a "Sendzimir" mill or
"Z" mill comprises a housing containing two sets of opposing rolls in a 1-2-3-4
arrangement. (EP 0 693 327 A1 describes a mill
according to the preamble of claim 1, and references
earlier US patents to such mills.) More specifically, in such a mill a pair of
work rolls is typically supported by two pairs of first intermediate rolls, in
turn supported by three pairs of second intermediate rolls, these being
finally supported by four pairs of roller bearing assemblies. The housing
includes an entrance and exit by which metal strips to be rolled can gain
access to the work rolls and leave the mill. Means are provided for
adjusting the positions of the backing rolls so as to adjust the gap between
the work rolls.In the original type of cluster mill, the housing is a single piece in
which all rolls are mounted, this housing being known as a monobloc
housing. In an alternative type, the housing is a two-part housing, the two
parts being split horizontally. The two parts of the housing, arranged one
on top of the other, are held together by four columns mounted at the
comers of the housing, each column running through both halves of the
housing and anchored in the lower housing, securing the two halves of the
housing together. Four hydraulic cylinders are mounted upon the comers
of the upper half of the housing, each cylinder pulls upon a respective
column to secure the two halves of the housing whilst the strips are being
rolled.The relative position between the rolls may be varied to achieve
particular transverse profiles and longitudinal sections, or in response to the
strip's shape. Conventionally, this is done by varying eccentrics within the
backing assemblies. Each backing assembly consists of a plurality of roller
bearings mounted upon a shaft. The shaft is mounted upon a series of 
eccentrics keyed to the shaft, each eccentric being mounted upon a saddle
which rests in a partial bore of the mill housing. On the uppermost and the
lowermost pair of backing assemblies, the eccentrics include eccentric rings,
these rings having teeth which engage with similarly toothed racks.
Movement of the racks, by a hydraulic cylinder, turns the eccentrics, and so,
via the roll stacks, alters the position of the work rolls.In order to vary the work rolls position a small amount, a large
movement of the hydraulic cylinder is
