<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vulcanizable 
compositions including copolymers of acrylic esters and 
acrylonitrile. The present invention also relates to the end-products 
which can be obtained by the vulcanization of 
the above vulcanizable products. Nitrile rubbers are often used in special 
applications, in particular in the automobile industry, 
and in the fields of cables and technical items, where 
excellent mechanical properties are required together 
with a good resistance to solvents and to the cold. 
Particularly in the car industry, the above nitrile 
rubbers cannot be used at high temperatures (for 
example more than 130°C), which often occur in certain 
parts of the bonnet, such as the power supply circuit, 
conduction and oil-cooling circuits, transmission and 
air-conditioning apparatus.  
 An alternative to the above nitrile rubbers 
consists in acrylic rubbers which have a good 
resistance to temperature but have inadequate 
mechanical properties and a limited resistance to 
solvents. JP-A-203614/1985, 203615/1985 and 203616/1985 
and US-A-4129 708 describe an elastomeric composition containing 
cyanoalkyl acrylate. When the alkyl group has a short 
chain, for example cyanomethyl or cyanoethyl acrylate, 
the polymers have the disadvantage that the glass 
transition temperature tends to be too high with a 
consequent limited resistance to the cold. EP-A-467 348 describes elastomeric copolymers 
containing a monomer having the formula 
CH2=CR1-CO-O-R2-O-CH2-CH2-CN.The complexity involved in the preparation of the 
above acrylates is evident, with consequent effects on 
the economy of the process and cost of the finished 
product. The present invention relates to a vulcanizable 
composition which overcomes the disadvantages mentioned 
above, and the end-products which can be obtained from 
the above vulcanizable composition. In accordance with this, the present invention 
relates to an elastomeric copolymer obtained from the  
 
statistic polymerization of: 
a) a monomer selected from those having general formula 
CH2=CR'-CO-OR, wherein R is a monofunctional radical 
selected from linear or branched C1-C6 alkyl radicals, 
preferably C2-C4, and more preferably butyl, and (C1-C6 
alkoxy)-C1-C6-alkyl radicals and R' is selected from -H 
and -CH3, and is preferably -H; b) (meth)acrylonitrile; c) a third monomer selected from: 
c1) a chlorinated vinyl ester, preferably 
vinylchloroacetate; c2) a mixture of an unsaturated carboxylic acid, 
preferably (meth)acrylic acid, and an aliphatic or 
ar
