<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a decorative cover for an aperture cutout in an electrical cabinet door or cover plate in order to allow access to a control element of an electrical appliance, such as, for example, a handle of a circuit breaker. This decorative cover consists of a rectangular or square frame (10) and of integral fixing means including at least two screws (11) associated with two nuts (12) provided with fixing lugs (13). These nuts can take up a first rest position in which the lugs are integrated at the side of the frame carrying the corresponding screw and, after rotation by a quarter-turn, a second fixing position in which they protrude with respect to the frame and bear against the cover plate (5) in order to clamp it against the frame. This embodiment is advantageous in that it avoids cutting out the cover plate and producing fixing holes for the decorative cover in the factory.
