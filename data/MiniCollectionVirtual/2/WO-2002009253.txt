<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: System for overvoltage protectionBackground of the inventionThe invention relates to a system for lightning and surge protection of objects, in which equipment is set up which has an electrical power supply. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system for surge protection of an object comprising a supply unit, which is connected to the secondary output of an external transformer, in which the secondary windings of the external transformer are coupled in a star configuration, the star point of the transformer being connected to a downstream neutral conductor and an earth electrode provided near to the transformer.In particular, the invention may be used as a system for lightning and surge protection for an object set up on a limited area, on the ground or on a building. Examples of such an object comprise an installation provided with an antenna, e.g. a GSM base station. Surge protection devices for electrical power supplies are generally known.The protection device according to the application may be used to protect against surges with a high energy content, such as surges caused by lightning or electromagnetic pulse (EMP). More in particular, the application relates to protection against surge caused by lightning strikes in a power supply for electrical equipment set up in objects, such as transmitter/receiver stations for radio traffic.For such a protection device, in addition to a number of specific components and measures, one or more (preferably at least two) earth electrodes are employed for the purpose of deflecting the charge which is inherent in the surge and distributing it over the greatest possible area. It goes without saying that these earth electrodes must have the least possible resistance to the zero potential. It is, moreover, important that the ground area over which the charge of the lightning strike is to be distributed is at least of a minimum magnitude.E.g., in the case of electrical power supplies for base stations for mobile telecommunications, such a minimum area is often not available because, for economic reasons, the area is preferably chosen to be no larger than necessary for the dimensions of the foot of the antenna mast. In the case that the object is positioned on top of a building, usually only a limited number of conductors with earth electrodes are used. 

 If the charge of a lightning or of EMP strikes the cabinet in which the power supply is housed or the metal frame to which the cabinet is attached, there is a danger of parasitic flash-over
