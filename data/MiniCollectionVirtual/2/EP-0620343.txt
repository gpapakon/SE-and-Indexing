<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a kinematic 
device for cremone bolt closings, comprising a handle 

assembly and a moving mechanism for the rods of the 
cremone bolt, connected together by a square cross-section 

shaft. The handle assembly comprises a handle 
1 coupled by means of a boss 6 to a second tubular 

element 12 on a support case 10, a device being formed 
in the lower portion 16 of said case 10 to fix the 

angular open/closed positions of the handle 1. The 
square cross-section shaft 3 connects the handle 

assembly to a moving mechanism 2, in which, inside a 
box-shaped body 35, there is a mechanism made up of a 

sprocket wheel 38 and a pair of rack elements 44, 45, 
integral with respective guides sliding in respective 

straight guide housings 50, 51, elements 48, 49 
engaging the pair of cremone bolt rods 59, 60 being 

formed on the outside of said box-shaped body 35. The 
present invention is particularly suitable for closing 

metal doors and windows opening outward.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kinematic device for 
cremone bolt closings, comprising a handle assembly and 
a moving mechanism for the rods of the cremone bolt, 
which are connected together by a square cross-section 
shaft, said device being particularly suitable for 
closing metal doors and windows that open outward. The use of metal doors and windows, in particular 
made of aluminium, has further increased with the 
decrease in the types of profile used to manufacture 
door and window frames, and with the use of the so-called 
"European chamber", that is to say the use of a 
space of a substantially unified size for all frames 
(for example that between the wing profile and the 
frame profile) made to house certain types of accessory 
and mechanism specially studied to be inserted and 
locked into this space, substantially without having to 
perform any type of operation. However, in some 
working conditions, for example in case of windows 
opening outward, for geometrical reasons, the space 
known as the "European chamber" cannot be used. 
Furthermore, there are some disadvantages connected 
with the working dimensions of the handle with respect 
to the fixed frame, in particular when opening. In 
these cases, in order to house the accessories, it is 
necessary to use the base chambers of the profile, and 
if necessary to use larger sized chambers. Handles for windows opening outward are found in 
the state of the art, which, although based on the 
cremone bolt mechanism (which guarantees optimal 
closing, locking the window both above and below onto 
the window frame), move the cremone bolt rods by means 
of sliders, which move the cremone bolt rods directly. 
The handle forms an integral part of this type of 
device and, consequently, it cannot be used separately  
 
in other types of accessory, whatever its aesthetic value 
may be. Swiss patent No. 473300 (granted on May 31, 1969 and 
published on July 15, 1969) discloses a kinematic device 
for cremone bolt closing devices for door and window 
frames comprising a handle and a moving mechanism 
connected by a shaft, in which said shaft has a 
square cross-section, and said moving mechanism comprises 
a box-shaped body substantially in the shape of a 
parallelepipedon, a first closing plate, a bore 
being formed on said plate, and a sprocket wheel, 
said mechanism further comprising a pair of rack elements 
cooperating with said sprocket wheel and 
elements for engagement of a pair of rods, the 
arrangement being such that rotation of said

Kinematic device for cremone bolt closing devices 
for door and window frames, comprising a handle assembly 

(1') and a moving mechanism (2) connected by a shaft (3), 
in which: 


said handle assembly (1') comprises a handle (1), 
coupled by a first tubular element (4), the engaged end 

thereof being integral with the handle, and by means of a 
boss (7) to a second tubular element (12) arranged in a 

substantially central position on the upper part (11) of 
a support case (10), substantially in the shape of a 

parallelepipedon, a first bore (8) being formed in a 
substantially central position on said boss (7), there 

being formed in the lower part (16) of said case (10) a 
first housing (17) of substantially circular form and a 

pair of grooves (18, 18') arranged in a diametrically 
opposite position with respect to said first housing and 

in communication therewith, a positioning ring (20) with 
a square opening (21) being arranged in said first 

housing, a plurality of indentations (23) being formed 
symmetrically around the external edge (22) of said ring, 

said indentations being arranged so as to cooperate with 
spherical elements (24) held against said outer edge by 

the action of spring elements (25) housed inside said 
grooves, a pair of bores (13, 13') being formed in said 

support case, in a position substantially symmetrical to 
said second tubular element (12); 
said shaft (3) has a square cross-section 
substantially coinciding with that of said opening (21), 

and can be inserted into said first tubular element, 
said moving mechanism comprises a box-shaped body 
(35) substantially in the shape of a parallelepipedon and 

a first closing plate (36), a second bore (37) being 
formed on said plate, a second housing (41) of a 

substantially circular shape being formed within said 
box-shaped body, said second housing holding a sprocket 

wheel (38) in movable engagement in a coaxial relation  
 

with an adaptor (40) having a square internal opening 
(39) capable of engaging with said shaft, said mechanism 

further comprising a pair of rack elements (44, 45)
