<ABSTRACT>
Guide stretcher for electrically charged particles using electrodes (11) connected to a sleeve (12) by support structures (14) which consist, according to the invention, of radial members under tensile stress. Good centring of the electrodes (11) is maintained, as is a low degree of degassing.

<CLAIMS>
Structure for guiding electrically charged 
particles, composed of electrodes (11) located along a 

trajectory (T) of the particles, a sleeve (12) around the 
electrodes (11), and supports (14) joining the sleeve 

(12) to the electrodes (11), characterized in that the 
supports (14) are spokes which are embedded in the 

electrodes (11) and in the sleeve (12) and are under 
tensile stress. 
Guide structure according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the sleeve has surfaces provided with 

protuberances (18 and 19) between consecutive spokes of 
the electrodes (11). 
Guide structure according to either of Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the sleeve (12) is monobloc. 
Guide structure according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that circular electrically conductive 

deposits (20 and 21) joining together the spokes of 
a single electrode (11) are formed on the sleeve (12).
