<ABSTRACT>
A thermistor positioned within a tubular 
probe adjacent its closed distal end has lead wires 

connected with terminals by both crimp and weld 
connections that are independent of one another. A 

non-rigid heat transfer medium fills the distal end 
portion of the probe in surrounding relationship to 

the thermistor. An opening in the sensor housing 
leads to the interior of the probe and receives a 

dielectric sleeve in which tail end portions of the 
terminals are positioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to the art of 
sensors and, more particularly, to sensors of the 
type having a thermistor positioned within a tubular 
probe. The invention is particularly applicable to 
temperature sensors for sensing the temperature of a 
fluid and will be described with specific reference 
thereto. However, it will be appreciated that the 
invention has broader aspects and can be used for 
other purposes such as sensing liquid levels by 
supplying sufficient current to the thermistor to 
cause self-heating. Temperature sensors commonly include a 
thermistor positioned within a tubular probe. It is 
common to pot the thermistor in a rigid heat 
transfer medium such as epoxy. Damage to the 
thermistor, and to the lead wires and their 
connections to plug-in terminals, may occur due to 
thermal expansion and contraction during use of the 
device or by curing of the potting medium. It would 
be desirable to improve the integrity of the 
connections between the lead wires and the 
terminals, and to minimize damage or failure caused 
by expansion and contraction during use of the 
device. A temperature sensor of the type described 
has the thermistor lead wires connected to the 
terminals with both crimp connections and weld  
 
connections. This redundant connection arrangement 
between the thermistor lead wires and the terminals 
provides very high reliability of the temperature 
sensor. In a preferred arrangement, the crimp 
connection is located closer to the thermistor than 
the weld connection. In accordance with another aspect of the 
application, a non-rigid heat transfer medium such 
as silicon grease completely fills the distal end 
portion of the probe in surrounding and 
encapsulating relationship to the thermistor. The terminals are shaped with grooves and 
embossed depressions for enhancing the crimp 
connection to the lead wires. The terminals are 
also shaped to minimize leakage of air or liquid 
therepast, and to securely lock same in a molded 
plastic connector. An opening in the sensor housing 
communicates with the interior of the tubular probe. 
The opening is enlarged and receives a dielectric 
sleeve in which the lead wire-to-terminal 
connections are positioned. The cylindrical bore in the probe has two 
different diameters intersecting at a shoulder and 
the dielectric sleeve has one end abutting the 
shoulder. It is principal object of the present 
invention to provide an improved sensor having 
redundant connections between terminals and lead 
wires. It is also an
