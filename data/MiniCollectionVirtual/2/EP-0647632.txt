<ABSTRACT>
A novel benzodiazepine derivative represented by general formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. These 
compounds are useful as medicines, in particular, for treating and preventing diseases in which CCK-B receptor and gastrin receptor 

participate, because they have CCK-B receptor antagonism, gastrin receptor antagonism and the effect of inhibiting gastric 
juice secretion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical agent, in 
particular, a novel benzodiazepine derivative or a salt 
thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base 
having a CCK-B receptor antagonistic activity and/or a 
gastrin receptor antagonistic activity. With respect to benzodiazepine derivatives, various 
synthetic studies have been made for the purpose of 
developing drugs having an activity on the central nervous 
system (psychotropic agents) which act on a benzodiazepine 
receptor. Recently, some of the benzodiazepine derivatives 
have been reported to exhibit a CCK-A (cholecystokinin-A) 
receptor antagonistic activity and a CCK-B (cholecystokinin-B) 
receptor antagonistic activity. Also, it is reported that a compound having a high 
CCK-B receptor antagonistic activity inhibits the gastric 
acid secretion induced by pentagastrin (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 
162, 273-280, 1989). The present inventors disclosed, in an earlier 
application (WO92/11246), novel benzodiazepine derivatives 
which are apparently different in the chemical structure from 
the conventionally known compounds described in the  
 
unexamined published Japanese Patent Application No. Sho-63-238069 
and which have markedly excellent effects in the 
pharmacological activity. The above-described compounds have 
markedly excellent pharmacological effects and hence are 
expected to have clinical effects. However, similar to the 
conventionally known benzodiazepine derivatives, these 
compounds have a problem with absorption by oral 
administration. In view of the above problem, the present inventors 
made extensive studies on the synthesis of analogues, and 
found novel benzodiazepine derivatives which are expected to 
have excellent activities even by oral administration and 
completed the present invention. That is, the present invention relates to novel 
benzodiazepine derivatives represented by the general formula 
(I) or salts thereof: 
wherein R¹ represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or 
a hydroxyl group,
 
 
   R² represents (a) a phenyl group substituted with at 
least one of the following substituents: an amino group which 
may be substituted, a lower alkyl group, a cyano group, a 
nitro group, a carboxyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, 
a carbamoyl group which may be substituted or a 3- to 
7-membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group; (b) a 
pyridyl group; or (c) a benzimidazolyl group, and
 
   R³ represents a phenyl group or a pyridyl group,
 
   with the proviso that, when R¹ is a hydrogen atom or 
a
