<ABSTRACT>
Offset printing machine comprising a plate cylinder (2) for 
receiving the block (5), an inking apparatus (6) mounted at 

the plate cylinder, a blanket cylinder (3) and an impression 
cylinder (4) serving to press the material to be printed (9) 

against the blanket cylinder. The blanket cylinder (3) is 
supported by bearings (11) mounted fixedly in the frame (1) 

of the printing machine and the plate cylinder (2) and the 
impression cylinder (4) are adjustable in relation to the 

blanket cylinder (3), such as through eccentric bushes mounted 
in the machine frame (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an offset printing machine 
comprising a plate cylinder for receiving the block, an 
inking apparatus mounted at the plate cylinder, a blanket 
cylinder and an impression cylinder serving to press the 
material to be printed against the blanket cylinder, with at 
least one of the cylinders being supported by the frame of 
the machine in such a way that it is adjustable in relation 
to the other cylinder or cylinders. Such a machine is known from EP-A-0 453 850. With this 
machine, at both its ends, the blanket cylinder is supported 
by bearings mounted in eccentric bushes incorporated in knee 
levers. By means of the eccentric bushes the blanket cylinder 
can be adjusted in relation to the other cylinders, and 
through the knee levers the cylinder is adjustable for 
switching the machine on and off. At high printing speeds, transitions between the plate 
cylinder and the block and at the ends of the blanket mounted 
on the blanket cylinder can cause vibrations. This 
phenomenon has been described in EP-A-0 131 813, for example, 
though with this known machine two plate cylinders and 
two blanket cylinders cooperating therewith are applied for 
printing material two-sidedly. In this case, occurence of vibrations is counteracted 
by positioning the one blanket cylinder somewhat obliquely. 
Obviously, this results in the fact that the distance between 
the cylinders is not equal across the total length. According to the invention, it has turned out that the 
occurence of vibrations can be counteracted in particular 
by providing for the fact that the blanket cylinder is 
supported by bearings fixedly mounted in the frame of the 
printing machine, and that the plate cylinder and the impression 
cylinder are supported by the frame in such a way, 
that they are adjustable in relation to the blanket cylinder. Surprisingly, the occurence of vibrations can thus be 
counteracted by supporting the blanket cylinder extremely 
stable in the machine frame, while the other cylinders can 
be adjustable .  Since the distance across which the plate cylinder is 
to be adjustable is only small, its adjustability will cause 
no problems as far as the arrangement of the inking apparatus 
is concerned. Preferably, it will be provided for, that the axes of 
the three cylinders will be almost in one plane. Due to the 
fact that the plate cylinder and the impression cylinder are 
adjustable in relation to the blanket cylinder, a deviation 
from this plane can occur, but this deviation will only be 
very

<CLAIMS>
Offset printing machine comprising a plate cylinder 
(2) for receiving the block (5), an inking apparatus (6) 

mounted at the plate cylinder, a blanket cylinder (3) and an 
impression cylinder (4) serving to press the material to be 

printed (9) against the blanket cylinder (3), with at least 
one of the cylinders (2, 3, 4) being supported by the frame 

(1) of the machine in such a way that it is adjustable in 
relation to the other cylinder or cylinders, characterized 

in that the blanket cylinder (3) is supported by bearings 
(11) fixedly mounted in the frame (1) of the printing machine, 

and that the plate cylinder (2) and the impression 
cylinder (4) are supported by the frame in such a way, that 

they are adjustable in relation to the blanket cylinder (3). 
Offset printing machine according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the axes (19, 20, 21) of the plate 

cylinder (2), the blanket cylinder (3) and the impression 
cylinder (4), respectively, are substantially in one plane 

(22). 
Offset printing machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the blanket (7) is fixedly mounted to 

a clamping bush (8), substantially seamless, said bush being 
slidable onto the blanket cylinder (3) owing to a slight 

expansion, and after that fixedly clamps itself on the 
cylinder. 
Offset printing machine according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the bearing (11), through which at 

least the one end of the blanket cylinder (3) is supported 
in the frame (1) of the machine, is received within a part 

(12) to be mounted to the machine frame (1) and bridging an 
opening (14) in the frame, said opening being so large that 

after removing the part (12), the clamping bush (8) can be 
moved through the opening on removing it from the blanket 

cylinder (3) or mounting it on the cylinder.
