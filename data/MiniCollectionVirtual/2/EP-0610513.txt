<ABSTRACT>
This cell is provided with a 
time input port a
t
, a plurality of 
space input ports b₀ to b
u
, a time 
output port a
t+1
, a plurality of 
space output ports C₀ to C
u
 and a 
calculation circuit to obtain the time 

output data and space output data 
from the time input data and space 

input data. The cell is so structured 
that the time output data is inputted 

into the time input port as the next 
time input data. The calculation circuit 

uses the above-mentioned time 
input data as time output data after 

inverting it or as it is, without inversion, 
depending on whether or not 

the sum of all the space input data 
is larger than a threshold value, and 

uses all the space input data as 
space output data after inverting it 

or as it is without inversion in accordance 
with the logic of the time 

input data. A plurality of basic cells 
are arranged in matrix in correspondence with the pixels arranged in matrix. The space output port and space input port of 

each basic cell are connected to the space input port and space output port of the other basic cells, respectively, to form a 
spatio-temporal pulse generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a basic cell for
firing spatio-temporal pulses for use in detecting
segments, contours, circles, squares and similar simple
graphic forms and their movement in the pattern
recognition of characters and graphic forms and a
cellular automaton-type pattern recognition unit using a
two-dimensional array of such cells. More particularly,
the invention pertains to a pattern recognition unit
which is applicable to the quantitative estimation of
reproduction errors display variations in testing CCD
image sensors, liquid crystal display TFT panels and the
like.Conventionally, CCD image sensors are visually
checked for color reproduction errors; but it is proposed
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 97074/91,
100768/91 and 100769/91 to estimate reproduction errors
on the basis of a quantified numerical value obtained by
fusing the errors detected through statistical processing
thereof, and these proposed schemes are disclosed in
United States Patent No. 5,204,948 issued to the inventor
of this application. Moreover, the inventor proposes, in
his paper "Color Reproduction Test For CCD Image
Sensors," Proc. 1990 International Test Conference, pp
493-497, Washington, D.C., September 10-14, 1990
(Literature 1), to test CCD image sensors by numerical
values obtained by fusing and quantifying various
variations detected through statistical processing.However, these conventional schemes utilize 
statistical techniques, and hence they rely largely on
probabilistic factors; it is impossible to definitely
say, "Here is a vertical stripe," or "Here is a slanted
stripe." The prior art methods are unsatisfactory in
this respect.In an example of conventional pattern
recognition, each pattern contained in an image is
attached a name by list processing and, to detect its
shape, the pattern is matched with a template pattern
prestored in a memory; the pattern recognition depends on
the extent of their matching.A neural network has also been under study as
another pattern recognizing scheme.In another example of the conventional pattern
recognition techniques, image processing operators such
as Laplacian, Sobel and differentiation are used to
detect segments and contours. An example of such an
image processing operator is shown in Fig. 1. The figure
is composed of 3 x 3 = 9 squares, each of which
corresponds to one pixel of an image to be processed.
The numerical value in each square is its weighted value.
The square at the center of the figure is made to
correspond to the pixel being
