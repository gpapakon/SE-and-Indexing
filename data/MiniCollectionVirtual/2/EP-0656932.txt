<ABSTRACT>
A process for ferreting out and extracting latent sediment-forming components from citrus oils to supplement a dewaxing process for the citrus oils. Psoralen epoxides in citrus oils are converted to diols in an accelerated and controlled manner. The epoxide-to-diol transformation is effected by mixing citrus oil with an aqueous acidic treatment solution under conditions (i.e., solution pH and volume) and for a sufficient period of time to convert substantially all of the psoralen epoxides. The diols formed thereby are preferentially dissolved in the aqueous phase during mixing. Upon separation of the aqueous phase from the oil, the citrus oil is substantially free of psoralen epoxides. By this method, epoxides are inexpensively eliminated from the citrus oils, resulting in an improved product having, for example, reduced sedimentation potential and reduced phototoxicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for removing sediment-forming
materials, such as high boiling components ("waxes"),
from citrus oils. More particularly, the invention relates
to a process for ferreting out latent waxes by treating
citrus oils with an aqueous acidic treatment solution.A well known problem with cold pressed citrus oils is
that they tend to develop sediments during storage.
Formation of these sediments is primarily attributable to the
presence of certain high boiling components in the oils,
commonly and generically referred to as "waxes". The removal
of sediments can be a tedious and expensive process.
Therefore, the art has searched for ways to reduce the wax
content of citrus oils, and thereby minimize sediment
formation. Unfortunately, no method known to date has proven
to be completely effective.The most common commercial "dewaxing" procedure involves
chilling freshly-produced citrus oil well below its normal
storage temperature. By chilling the oil, the solubility of
the waxes present in the oil is reduced and some of the waxes
tend to precipitate out of solution. The precipitates are
then removed by centrifuging the chilled oil. A very soluble
portion of the waxes, however, remains in solution after this
process.If the soluble waxes remaining in the citrus oil were
not susceptible to any subsequent chemical changes, this
commercial dewaxing procedure would provide a shelf-stable
citrus oil, because these waxes would remain soluble
indefinitely at normal storage temperatures. However, a
principal weakness of this procedure is that some of the
waxes do undergo chemical changes during storage. For
example, psoralen epoxides, which are relatively soluble in
cold citrus oils and thus are not removed by chilling-dewaxing,
gradually undergo hydrolysis in solution to yield
the corresponding diols. These diols are much less soluble
than their epoxide precursors in the citrus oil, and they
precipitate. In a typical citrus oil kept under typical 
storage conditions, this transformation occurs slowly but
continuously, resulting in increasing amounts of sediment
deposition over a period of years.The psoralen epoxides not removed by chilling are also
known to be phototoxic, making commercially-available citrus
oils unsuitable for use in fragrances and other products
applied to the skin.Attempts have been made to improve upon conventional
chilling-dewaxing processes. US-A-2,863,861 to
