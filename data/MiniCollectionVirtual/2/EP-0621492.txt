<ABSTRACT>
An antenna system comprising two similar antennas (1,1) with a 
monopulse feed system is scanned while transmitting in-phase 

radio waves from the two antennas. Reflected radio waves are 
received by the two antennas and fed to a hybrid circuit (4) which 

in turn produces a sum signal Σ and a difference signal Δ. 
After detection is performed by a detector (5), a signal processing 

unit (6) subtracts the difference signal Δ from the sum signal Σ. 
In this processing step, the output signal produced by the 

above subtraction process is actually output only if the 
receiving pattern waveform associated with the sum signal Σ has 

an upwardly convex form, that is, its double differential 
coefficient is negative and further if the receiving pattern 

waveform associated with the difference signal Δ has a 
downwardly convex form, that is, its double differential 

coefficient is positive, whereby an antenna pattern with beam 
compression is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of performing 
beam compression of radar antenna patterns, which can provide 
better performances in the beam compression process of an 
antenna pattern of a radar including a monopulse power feed 
system. In general, the beam width is one of the indexes representing the 
performance of an antenna pattern of a receiving antenna or 
other type antennas. A narrower beam width in an antenna 
pattern will give a better performance. However, there is a 
relationship of inverse proportion between the beam width and the 
size (length) of an antenna. Therefore, if the beam width is 
reduced, then the size of the antenna will be increased. 
Conversely, if the dimension of the antenna is reduced, then 
the beam width will be broadened. For example, in an antenna for a radar system, if it is 
desired to double the ability or the resolution to discriminate 
objects, it is required to halve the beam width and thus it is 
required to double the size of the antenna. The doubling of the  
 
size leads to not only a larger occupied region but also various 
disadvantages such as an increase in the weight of the antenna 
and in the size of a structure for supporting the antenna. 
Conversely, if the size of an antenna is halved, then the beam 
width will be doubled and the discrimination ability will be 
degraded by a factor of two. It is well known that there is such a conflicting 
relationship between the beam width and the size of an antenna. 
In most cases, an actual antenna has a limitation in the region 
it can occupy. Therefore, under these limited conditions, a 
certain degree of compromise associated with the beam width has 
to be made. One known beam compression technique to alleviate the 
above-described problems is to employ two similar antennas with 
a monopulse power feed system so as to reduce the beam width by 
subtracting the difference signal pattern between the two 
antennas from the sum signal pattern of the two antennas. 
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings is a schematic diagram illustrating 
a radar system which can perform beam compression in such a manner 
described above. In this figure, reference numerals 101, 101 
designate a pair of antennas with a monopulse power feed 
system, wherein each antenna has a length of a, and the 
center-to-center distance between the antennas is d. Reference 
numeral 102 designates a power divider and reference numeral 
103 designates a transmission circuit. The transmission circuit  
 
103 generates the transmission

<CLAIMS>
A method for compressing the beam width of the antenna 
pattern of a radar system , comprising the steps of: providing 

a radar antenna system including two similar antennas (1,1) 
having a monopulse power feed system; scanning said antenna system 

while transmitting radio waves from said two antennas of the 
antenna system in such a manner that both the radio waves 

transmitted from the respective antennas are in the same phase; 
receiving by the antenna system the radio waves which were 

transmitted from said antenna system and reflected by 
scattering objects and have finally come back to said antenna 

system; producing a sum signal and a difference signal of the 
received signals of said two antennas of the antenna system; 

and performing signal processing comprising the steps of 
subtracting said difference signal from said sum signal and 

providing the resulting signal as a final antenna output 
signal; said method being characterized in that said signal 

processing step further comprises the step of providing said 
final antenna output signal only if the double differential 

coefficient of the receiving pattern waveform associated with 
said sum signal is negative and further if the double 

differential coefficient of the receiving pattern waveform 
associated with said difference signal is positive, but 

providing a zero output signal if the above conditions are not 
satisfied.
