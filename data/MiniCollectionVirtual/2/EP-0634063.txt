<CLAIMS>
An earthing switch for a compressed gas-insulated, 
metal-clad, high-voltage switchgear with a movable 

earthing contact (3; 11), which is arranged so as to 
be insulated relative to the earthed cladding (1), 

and an electrical connection which bridges the 
insulating arrangement of the earthing contact (3; 

11) if necessary, characterised in that an 
additional contact arrangement (7, 8; 7a, 8a) is 

provided, which forcibly electrically bridges the 
insulating arrangement and which connects the 

movable earthing contact (3, 11) with the earthed 
cladding (1) outside the on and off switching 

positions during the course of the switching 

movement between these two positions. 
An earthing switch according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the movable earthing contact 

(3) is a knife switching contact (3), which is 
arranged on a rotatably driven shaft (4) and can be 

connected to sliding contact path (8) of the 
cladding (1) arranged concentrically around the 

shaft by means of a resilient pin (7), which is 
movable transversely to the shaft (4). 
An earthing switch according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the movable earthing contact 

is a linearly guided, movable switching rod (11), 
which can be connected to a sliding contact surface 

(8a) of the cladding (1) extending axially parallel 
by means of a resilient pin (7a), which is mounted 

so as to be movable transversely to the switching 
rod (11).
