<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a local area network (a
LAN) and, more specifically, to a network of the cordless
(or wireless) type, to enable data to be communicated by
radio between a plurality of user stations each comprising
a respective data terminal, by means of a fixed central
control device.Local networks have become increasingly widespread in the
informatics and telematics world for short-range
connections for enabling the transmission and distribution
of data and services between a plurality of users within
the same area, for example, in the same building. A local
network enables many data terminals of different kinds,
such as personal computers (PCs), minicomputers, printers,
etc. to be connected in an extremely flexible manner,
enabling very fast transmission speeds of the order of
hundreds of thousands of Kbits/sec.Up to now, most local networks have been of the wired type,
that is, of the type in which the connections between the
user stations and the central control devices are formed
entirely by wires.The appearance on the market of portable computers such as
laptop personal computers, has created a need for cordless
LANs.A cordless local area network reduces installation costs
because it eliminates the need to install connecting
cables. This type of network can also be formed in
situations in which it would be difficult or impossible to
install connecting wires, such as, in buildings which do
not have sockets for LANs or in which there are 
architectural constraints.A cordless LAN network may represent the ideal solution in
an organisation in which the positions of the user stations
or the number of stations connected in the network are
subject to frequent changes or modifications.A cordless LAN also represents the ideal solution for
organisations which are subject to frequent changes of
location. In this case, it would in fact be neither
practical nor economical to transfer a wired LAN.Finally, as stated above, a LAN network enables data to be
communicated even by portable personal computers, without
limiting the mobility of these new devices.The network according to the invention operates
particularly in accordance with the DECT (Digital European
Cordless Telecommunications) standard developed by ETSI
- the European Telecommunications Standards Institute - which
defines the specifications for radio connections between
users and a network in a private environment.The DECT system operates in the band between 1880 MHz and
1900 MHz and provides for radio transmission by means of a
hybrid
