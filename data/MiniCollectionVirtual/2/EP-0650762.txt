<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for methanol reforming which consists 
of an alloy represented by the general formula TM, 

wherein T is at least one element selected from the 
group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Y, Nb and Zn; and M is 

at least one element selected from the group 
consisting of elements (Cu, Ag and Au) belonging to 

group IB of the periodic table and elements (Fe, Co, 
Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) belonging to group VIII 

of the periodic table, said alloy having a surface 
comprising an oxide including the element T and, 

dispersed therein, fine metal particles composed of 
the element M. The catalyst is produced by preparing 

an alloy having an amorphous phase and/or a microcrystalline 
phase from a molten composition of TM, and 

subsequently heating the alloy at 50 to 700째C in an 
oxidizing atmosphere or an atmosphere like that in 

which methanol reforming is performed. Using the 
catalyst, methanol reforming can be efficiently 

performed at relatively low temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a methanol
reforming catalyst for use in the production of
hydrogen from methanol, a process for producing the
same, a method for reforming methanol, and the
use of a catalyst for methanol reforming.The demand is increasing for a highly purified
hydrogen gas to be used as, for example, an
atmospheric gas for use in the production of
semiconductors, and a fuel for use in a fuel cell, the
future spread of which is anticipated. Accordingly,
various hydrogen producing techniques have been
developed. In particular, the technique in which
methanol is cracked is drawing attention as a process
for obtaining hydrogen on a small or medium scale in
accordance with the above uses. This is because the
technique for mass-producing methanol from a variety
of resources such as petroleum, coal and natural gas
has been established in recent years, so that it can
be obtained at a lowered cost, and that methanol is
safer than hydrogen gas in handling so as to
facilitate its transportation and storage and to
permit realization of a system for easily producing
hydrogen.Various catalysts for use in methanol reforming
are known, including those disclosed in the 
specifications of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 47281/1974, 56302/1982, 17836/1983,
131501/1984, 96504/1985, 77103/1985 and 77104/1985 and
Japanese Patent Publication No. 11274/1979. Further,
a catalyst for use in cracking methanol to obtain
hydrogen is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. 166937/1983 published as JP-A-58 166 937
and corresponding to GB-A-2 117 366. In addition, a process for
producing methanol in the presence of an amorphous
alloy as a catalyst is described in the specification
of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
87233/1985.All the above conventional methanol reforming
catalysts do not always exhibit satisfactory
performance in practical use. Further, the production
of the catalysts has a problem in that the process is
complicated and it is difficult to obtain high
catalytic activities, because a metal salt or oxide is
used as the starting material, so that a treatment
comprising heating in an air stream containing
hydrogen to reduce part of the metal oxide or
hydroxide is essential for imparting a catalytic
activity to the catalysts. In particular, the catalyst
described in the specification of the Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 166937/1983 is produced by a chemical
process in which a metal salt is also employed as the
starting material, thereby bringing about a drawback
in that
