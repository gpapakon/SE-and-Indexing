<ABSTRACT>
A method of applying a clear glass primer (84) material and 
then a black glass primer (49) material onto the marginal edge (40) 

of a vehicular window glass (42), such as a windshield 
and/or rear window of an automobile, in which a dispenser 

(38) is employed to discharge a clear primer (84) material in 
discrete streams or drops and in which a black primer (49) 

material is conformally coated onto the clear primer 
material by another dispenser (36). The clear and black 

primer (84,49) materials are able to be applied to the window glass 
in a single pass operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to preparing the window glass of
automobiles or other vehicles for bonding with an associated
body flange of the vehicle, and, more particularly, to a
method of applying glass primer coatings onto the marginal
edge of the windshield or other glass elements of the
vehicle, in preparation of adhesively bonding the glass and
body flange together.The assembly of the windshield, rear window and other
glass elements of a vehicle to their associated body flanges
is an important operation in the manufacture of vehicles,
particularly from a safety standpoint. The federal
government requires vehicles to pass a windshield retention
test, and the materials which are used to assemble the
windshield to the body flanges of the vehicle must be
properly applied in order to pass the test and avoid
expensive recalls.The preparation of the windshield and associated body
flange of a vehicle for assembly involves a number of
operations. With respect to the windshield, glass
manufactures supply automobile windshields with a "blackened
area", i.e., an area of predetermined width along the
marginal edge of the windshield which is covered with a
black, ceramic frit having a roughened surface. It is the
responsibility of the automotive manufacturer to prepare 
this blackened area for assembly to the body flange of the
vehicle. First, a clear glass primer material is applied to
the blackened area, usually with a wet brush manipulated by
a robot or other automated brush mover. The primer may be
applied to the bristles of the brush by dispensing the
primer through the center of the brush. Preferably, a felt
wick is dragged by the robot immediately behind the wet
brush to wipe dry the clear glass primer, and to force the
clear glass primer into the roughened surface of the
blackened area. The clear glass primer prepares the
blackened area for receipt of a coat of black glass primer
material.The next step in the preparation of the windshield for
assembly to the vehicle body flange involves the application
of a black glass primer over the area which had been
previously coated with the clear glass primer. One method
of applying the black glass primer to the windshield
involves a manual operation using a flow brush or the like.
This method is labor-intensive, and human applicators are
prone to dripping some of the black glass primer from the
brush onto areas outside of the blackened, ceramic frit.
Such drips onto the clear portion of the glass are
unacceptable and may require rejection of the windshield for
use.

<CLAIMS>
A method of dispensing fluid coating materials
onto a glass substrate in a single pass comprising the steps

of:

a) causing a wick means and first and second
dispensing means to be moved together relative to the glass;
b) intermittently dispensing a first fluid
coating material from said first dispenser means such that

streams or drops of the first coating material are propelled
under pressure to impinge upon the glass while substantially

avoiding the application of liquid coating material outside
a portion of the glass to be coated;
c) distributing the dispensed first fluid coating material
over the portion of the substrate to be coated by said wick

means; and
d) dispensing a second coating material from
said second dispensing means such that a liquid film

emission is discharged from said second dispensing means,
the liquid film emission being substantially free of

atomized particles of the second coating material, to
provide a conformal coating to the first coating material.
The method of claim 1 wherein the first fluid coating material
is directed to impinge upon the glass at an angle of

incident which is less than 45° and within the vicinity of
an area formed between the wick means and the glass and

wherein at least some deflected droplets or particles of
first fluid coating material are entrapped by the wick means.
The method of claim 2 further comprising: 

providing a first support arm for carrying said
first dispensing means;
providing a second support arm for carrying said
second dispensing means;
a support means, said first and second support
arms attached to said support means; and
wherein said wick means is disposed between said
first and second dispensing means.
The method of claim 1 wherein the first and second
dispenser means are diametrically opposed to one another and

wherein said wick means is disposed between said first and
second dispenser means. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the intermittent
dispensing of the first fluid coating material is varied over the

portion of the substrates to be coated.
An apparatus for coating a portion of window glass (42)
used in the assembly of vehicles, said apparatus comprising:


a first dispensing means (38) for intermittently
dispensing a first fluid coating material (84) such that streams

or drops of the first coating material are propelled under
pressure to impinge upon a portion (40) of the glass to be

coated;
a wick means (46) for distributing the dispensed first fluid
coating material over the portion of the glass to be coated;

and
a second dispensing means (36) for dispensing a second
coating material (49) as a film emission, the film emission being

substantially free of atomized particles of the second
coating material, over the portion (40) of the glass to be

coated.
The apparatus of claim 6 further comprising:

a first support arm (52) for carrying said first
dispensing means (38);
a second support arm (50) for carrying said second
dispensing means (36);
a support means (34), said first and second support
arms attached to said support means; and
wherein said wick means (46) is disposed between said
first and second dispensing means.
The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the streams or
drops of the first coating material (84) impinge the glass at an

angle of incidence which is less than 45°.
The apparatus of claim 6 further comprising:

a means for controlling the dispensing of material
from said first and second dispensing means, including a

means for delaying the dispensing of material from said
second dispensing means after the first dispensing means (38)

begins dispensing and a means for delaying the stoppage of
dispensing from said second dispensing means (36) once said first

dispensing means stops dispensing.
The method of preparing window glass for
attachment to a vehicle comprising the steps of:


a) causing relative movement between a coating
tool assembly and said window glass;
b) intermittently dispensing a first fluid
coating material from a first dispenser means, carried by

said coating tool assembly, such that streams or drops of
the first coating material are propelled under pressure to

impinge upon a marginal edge of the glass while
substantially avoiding the application of liquid coating

material outside the marginal edge of the glass to be
coated, wherein the first fluid material is directed to impinge

within the vicinity of an area formed between a wick means,
carried by said coating tool assembly, and the glass, such

that at least some deflected droplets or particles of first fluid
coating material are entrapped by the wick means; 
c) distributing the dispensed first fluid material,
over the marginal edge of the glass to be coated, by said

wick means;
d) delaying the dispensing of a second coating
material from a second dispensing means, carried by said

coating tool assembly, until said second dispensing means
has been moved relative to the glass, so as to provide a

conformal coating of said second coating material onto said
first coating material which has been deposited on the

glass, said second dispensing means dispensing said second
coating material as a liquid film emission, substantially

free of atomized particles of the second coating material;
and
e) discontinuing the dispensing of coating
material from said first dispensing means once the portion

of the glass to be coated has been coated with said first
coating material, while continuing the dispensing and

relative movement thereof of the second dispensing means
until the first coating material deposited on the substrate

has been coated with the second coating material.
