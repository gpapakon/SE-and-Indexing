<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of treating glass light
waveguide ends according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a method according to the preamble of claim 1 for
mechanically polishing a glass waveguide end is known from US 51
36 820. In US 52 26 101, published on equal date as the present
application's priority by the same assignee, a similar method is
disclosed to obtain better return loss results.
A method was therein disclosed to mechanically
polish the distal end of a glass waveguide thereafter to
slightly melt the surface of said distal end to reduce
return loss, the preferred means of inducing such melting
being a laser.While the method is described in said former application
achieved and proved results, potential problems
remained. Melting the glass at the surface of the light
waveguide can alter the light waveguide surface geometry,
and the degree of melting can be difficult to control. Due
to the large amounts of energy needed, undesirable melting
and the formation of holes in the light waveguide surface
can occur. Another related problem is that of changes to
the mode field diameter of the light waveguide due to dopant
diffusion.Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide an
improved method which retains the advantages of the former method
while reducing or eliminating some of the disadvantages. The foregoing object is solved according to the invention by a
method having the features set out in claim 1. The improved
method of treating glass light waveguide ends begins,as did the
former method, with mechanically polishing the light waveguide
distal end. The reflectance of the light waveguide end is
thereafter reduced by vaporizing at least some glass at the light
waveguide distal end by use of a laser beam directed thereon
wherein the laser beam uses a wavelength in the range of 0.1 x 10-6
meters to 1.5 x 10-6 meters. Using this method, the reflectance
of the light waveguide can be brought into the range of -45 dB to
-80 dB.According to a preferred embodiment, while it is
possible to practice the present method by directing the
laser beam at the light waveguide distal end only once,
results tend to improve by increasing the number of times
the laser is directed against the light waveguide distal
end. Preferably repetitions can increase from 2 to 1000 times, as
desired, by the user. Superior results have been obtained
by employing a laser beam having a peak power in the range
from 0.1 to 100 watts and a pulse duration of less than 1/2
second, with the spot size of
