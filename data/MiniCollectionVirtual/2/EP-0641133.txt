<ABSTRACT>
An improved system for effecting broadband/multimedia calls and 
connections within an intelligent switched telecommunication network. This system, which 

employs object-oriented commands, is capable of establishing complex call and connection 
configurations between multiple network subscribers participating in a 

broadband/multimedia call. These object-oriented commands, which are stored in and 
initiated from network adjuncts or service control points, eliminate the need for long series 

of individual low-level commands to be transmitted to the network switching system. 
Furthermore, the system provides for a finite set of object-oriented commands which are 

capable of implementing the many complex and diverse interconnections which may be 
required in effecting multi-party broadband/multimedia calls. This is accomplished by 

selectively combining various object-oriented commands to produce the connectivity which 
will support the desired broadband/multimedia call.

<DESCRIPTION>
Modern switched intelligent telecommunication networks typically comprise 
one or more central office switching systems trunked together, and connected to lines that 
which are directed to the various network subscribers. A variety of communication 
services are provided to the network subscribers via one or more service network elements 
connected to the switching systems. These services range from standard voice-band audio 
connections (also referred to as "narrowband" connections) established between two or 
more network subscribers, to broadband connections which allow subscribers to 
simultaneously exchange of audio, video, and/or digital data (such connections may be 
classified as "broadband/multimedia"). Within a switched telecommunication network, the network elements send 
predetermined commands to the switching systems relating to the particular service or 
services requested by a network subscriber. The switching systems configure themselves 
in response to the commands to effect the requested services. Despite wide acceptance of 
intelligent network architectures in principle, there has been no clear industry consensus 
on how to implement and deploy such systems. The most significant issues involved are 
the creation and control of complex call and connection configurations in the switching 
systems by the services network elements, along with resolution of interaction between 
commanded services and existing switching system features. Existing methods of handling the complex control of intelligent switching 
systems (such as the method put forth in the Bellcore's "Advanced Intelligent Networks 
Technical Advisory," TA-NWT-001112, Issue 1, May 1991) require network elements, 
such as adjuncts and service control points ("SCPs"), to produce a set of low level service 
instructions to the switching system which directly manipulate call topology component 
resources in order to reach a desired switch configuration. These instructions directly 
manipulate low-level switching system resources and, therefore, contend for the use of 
these resources with existing switching system features. Typically, these low-level 
instruction sets do not follow any set pattern, and therefore result in difficult to solve 
feature interaction problems that directly impact all existing switch features. The required 
low-level transformations also are difficult to design and do not always naturally lead to 
a target switch configuration. The drawbacks of this type of low-level, direct manipulation of an
