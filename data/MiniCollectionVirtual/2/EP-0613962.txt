<ABSTRACT>
A high gloss color finish for a plastic 
article is formed by coating and curing a colored primer 

layer (12) onto a plastic substrate (10). A light 
transmissive basecoat (14) is applied and cured onto the 

primer layer (12) to form a substrate (10) with a 
colored surface. Indium islands (20) are vacuum deposited 

onto the basecoat (12) to a thickness up to 100 
Angstroms to form a visually macroscopically continuous 

layer (21). The island layer (21) is etched to remove 
smaller sized islands. A transparent topcoat (24) is 

applied onto the basecoat and indium islands and cured 
in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention relates to a 
substrate coated with a high gloss color coating incorporating 
metallic islands. It has long been desired to produce a high 
gloss paint system for automotive finishes. Various 
technologies have been attempted to produce a brilliant 
reflective color finish that can be applied to plastic 
material as well as metal surfaces. A high gloss finish 
gives a wet appearance to the surface without a metallic 
flake appearance. These technologies varied from trying 
new high gloss formulas of paint, new processes of 
applying the paint to the surface such as electro-coating, 
to adding metallic flakes to the liquid paint 
resin. The consuming public, has long been desirous of 
having a rich glossy finish coating often having a 
highly polished appearance. It has been known to produce bright chrome 
finishes to provide a mirror-like finish on a plastic 
substrate to substitute for chrome metal parts. Some of  
 
these technologies use vacuum depositing of metal film or 
discrete islands onto the plastic substrate and covering 
the metal with a clear resinous top coat. Processes for 
producing bright chrome metallic finishes have been 
taught in United States Patent Nos. 4,407,871; 4,431,711; 
and 4,713,143 which suggests solvent etching to provide 
areas of substrate which may bond to the resinous top 
coat, and EP-A- 0,037,235 which relates to a mirror-like 
finish on a plastics component. Elastomeric materials are also desired to substitute 
for conventional metal parts. The coating on elastomeric 
materials must have the same gloss and lustre and 
otherwise correctly match the color applied onto other 
metal components. US-A-4 551 387 provides a process in which a filmy 
layer of metal of 20-300 Angstrom in thickness is applied 
so as to provide a concealed tone of metallic lustre. What is desired is a high gloss colored finish and a 
process for making the high glass color finish that 
incorporates the vacuum deposition of metallic islands 
on a plastic color substrate and allows a color layer 
underneath to be visible and enhanced therethrough. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a 
process for applying a high gloss color coating on an 
article includes the steps of providing a colored surface 
on a substrate and vacuum depositing discrete thin 
islands of a low melting metal having a thickness  
 
up to approximately 10nm (100 Angstroms) on the substrate. The 
metal has a melting point between 100 degrees 
C to 350 degrees C., preferably between 125

A process for applying a high gloss color coating on 
an article characterized by the steps of providing a 

colored surface on a substrate, vacuum depositing metal with a melting point between 100° and 350°C 
on the substrate to a thickness up to approximately 10 nm (100 

Angstroms), and applying a clear resinous protective top 
coat as a liquid, and drying said top coat to adhere said protective 

film to the article, characterized in that the metal 
is deposited 

in discrete thin islands formed to visually appear 
macroscopically as a continuous film while having spaces 

between said discrete islands where said colored surface 
of said substrate remains visible through said spaces and through said thin islands, 

by etching the vacuum deposited material to remove small 
islands that have been deposited on said substrate in the 

spaces between said discrete islands and enlarging the 
spaces through which said colored surface is visible 

between the remaining islands, by wetting the colored substrate surface with said top coat liquid, drying said top coat so applied to a protective film encapsulating said discrete islands and adhering 
said protective film directly to said colored surface of said substrate.
