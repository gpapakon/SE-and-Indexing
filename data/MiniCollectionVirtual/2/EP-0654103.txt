<ABSTRACT>
A method for construction of a noise screen or baffle and a possibly planted noise screen or baffle (2) with a core consisting of sound absorbing material and being surrounded by a steel netting (6), said noise screen being anchored in the ground by means of vertical supports (4) being anchored with mutually distance in the ground on a row along one side of the noise screen (2), whereafter steel netting (6) is bound together to a net wall along one side of the supports (4). Thereafter said core is made by stacking up layers of blocks (10) preferably consisting of steady mineral wool (for instance (Grodan)TM) or similar material along the net wall, whereafter the steel netting (6) is bound together to a further net wall along the opposite side of the stacked-up core of blocks (10), before final positioning in front of said supports (4) at opposite side of the noise screen (2) vertical panels (18) made from steel or wood, which panels (18) together with the steel net walls (6) and the core material (10) are connected tight to the supports (4) by means of through-going bolts or threaded rods (20), fishplates (22) and nuts (24). If the noise screen (2) has to be planted, the core material (10) is surrounded by a web or a mat (8) with plant seeds, for instance grass seeds, or with inserted little plants, so that the web or the mat (8) is surrounded by the steel netting walls (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for construction of a noise screen of the type 
as described in the preamble of claim 1. In urban areas it is particularly in connection with road and industrial systems often necessary 
to etablish noise screens - and often one has forgotten during projecting to take 
into account space for such noise screens. Also from a financial point of view one tries to 
avoid noise screens, which traditionally are very expensive. For environmental reasons it is often decided to build the noise screens afterwards along 
roads or along a neighbour boundary to a noisy company, which often implies huge 
traffic problems and/or problems of placement, because known noise screens need 
much space - both for the construction work - but also still because of the construction. EP-A-393 735 discloses a wall on which vegetation can grow comprising a frame, at 
least one panel carried by said frame and containing a vegetation substrate, means for 
adding liquid at the top of said panel, means for collecting liquid at the bottom of said 
panel, wherein said panel is built up of at least two layers of mineral wool which are 
mutually separated by a capillary separating material, and to a panel therefor. A panel 
could be assembled from a number of layers of mineral wool which are in turn mutually 
separated by a layer of capillary separating material. This panel is formed into a very 
managable product because it is arranged in a very coarse-mesh net stretched around it, 
which, if desired, need not to be removed during arranging of the panel in the wall. The invention has for its purpose to provide a method for construction of a noise screen 
of the type described in the introductory part, and by means of which a very considerable 
relief and reduction of price of the construction work by simple provisions may be 
obtained, as the method according to the invention only needs very little space - during 
the construction work. The method according to the invention is distinctive in that the steel netting is bound together 
to form a net wall along one side of the supports, that said core consisting of blocks of, for instance 
GRODAN™, is stacked up along the net wall, that the steel netting along the  
 
opposite side of the core is bound together to form a net wall, that vertical panels made 
from steel or wood are positioned in front of said support at the opposite side of the noise 
screen, and said panels together with the steel nettings and the core material are 
connected tightly

supports (4) being anchored in the ground in a row and with mutual distance and said 

core being made by stacking layers of blocks (10) consisting of steady mineral wool, 
namely
