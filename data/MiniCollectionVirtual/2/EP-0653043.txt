<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger, in particular an oil cooler for internal combustion engines, consists of several parallel tubes (19) for the heat exchange medium and of leaf- and plate-shaped heat exchange elements (10) perpendicular to the tubes and fixed thereto. The heat exchange elements (10) are bent at their outer edges (11) and are imbricated on top of each other. An adapter element (13) is provided for supplying the medium to be cooled. The adapter element (13) has a liquid inlet pipe (15), a liquid outlet pipe (18) and fastening means (14).

<CLAIMS>
Heat exchanger, especially oil cooler for internal combustion engines, constituted of
several pipes with pipe sections (17, 19) parallel arranged in respect to each other for

conducting the heat exchanging means, and are also constituted of plated and lamellar
heat exchanging elements (10) perpendicular arranged with respect to the pipes, the said

elements being tightly connected to the pipes ; the said plated heat exchanging elements
(10) being bent at the external edges (11) and flaky overlapped, 
characterised in that
 the
medium supply occurs through further pipes (17, 19) perpendicularly arranged in respect

to the heat exchanging elements and 
characterised in that
 the said pipes meet an adapter
element (14) ; the said adapter element (14) presenting a liquid inlet (15), a liquid outlet

(18) and attachment means ; the said adapter element (14) being aplane plate which is
attached inside the last heat exchanging element (10).
Heat exchanger according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a high pressure valve (23) is
arranged in the adapter element (14).
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the pipes
(figure 4) are arranged on the opposite side of the adapter plate for the heat exchanging

media.
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the heat
exchanging elements (10) and/or the adapter element (14) as well as the pipe sections (17,

19) arranged in the heat exchanging elements are constituted of solder - plated
aluminiums.
Heat exchanger according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
different elements (11, 12, 13, 17, 19) are connected to each other while being soldered.
