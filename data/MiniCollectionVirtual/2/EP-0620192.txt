<ABSTRACT>
A solid-liquid separator for sludge which includes a 
tank (1) with a sludge suction port (2), an intake/exhaust port (3) 

and a 
sludge discharge port (4). A plurality of agitating blades (6) are 

mounted on a rotatable shaft (7) within the tank and are capable of 
being driven in either of two rotational directions. A 

plurality of injection nozzles (5) are internally mounted on the 
bottom of the tank in such a manner as to eject a mixture of 

sludge coagulant and air into sludge contained within the tank. 
A pump (8) which is capable of producing a vacuum or pressure is 

connected to the intake/exhaust port so as to produce either a 
vacuum or a pressure within the tank and the sludge suction 

port is adapted to be connected to a source of sludge to intake 
the sludge into the tank. The injection nozzles (5) are connected 

to a source of sludge coagulant (13) and air. The disclosure also 
relates to the method of treating the sludge to separate into 

solid and liquid phases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separator for 
efficiently separating sludge into solid and liquid phases in a 
recovery tank for solidifying the sludge, thereby facilitating 
the disposal thereof. Sludge is not easily separated into solid matter and 
water content, and accordingly, technical development has been 
demanded for solidifying sludge to a state practicable for 
disposal of the same. In recent years, chemicals for 
solidifying sludge have been studied; however, the 
solidification of the sludge using these chemicals does not 
obtain satisfactory results. For example, a sludge solidifying technique on its 
way to development has a construction as shown in Figure 4 of 
the drawings of the application. In Figure 4, a sludge 
coagulant and a gas are injected through an injection port N 
mounted on one end of the bottom portion of the tank T into 
recovered sludge D in the tank T. Then, the interior of the 
tank T is evacuated by vacuum by way of a vacuum pump (not 
shown) through an exhaust port A mounted in the upper portion 
of the tank T, so that the gas injected through the injection 
port N together with the sludge coagulant is passed through the 
sludge D as rising bubbles. Thus the sludge coagulant is raised 
in the gas and reacts with the sludge D to separate the sludge  
 
into solid and liquid phases. The sludge thus separated into 
solid and liquid is discharged from the interior of the tank T, 
and dewatered and filtered, to be solidified. The prior art described above, however, has the 
following disadvantage. Namely, sludge in the vicinity of the 
injection port N reacts with the coagulant to be separated into 
solid and liquid; however, sludge in the area shown by slant 
lines in Figure 4 other than the vicinity of port N does not 
have an opportunity to react with the coagulant, and is not 
separated into solid and liquid. Accordingly, the solid-liquid 
separation of sludge in the sludge recovery tank is 
insufficient, which prevents satisfactory disposal of the 
sludge. According to the present invention, a plurality of 
injection nozzles are provided for injecting a sludge coagulant 
together with a gas into the bottom portion of a sludge 
recovery tank in a manner indicated by the dotted lines in 
Figure 3, and a plurality of agitating blades are also 
installed in the tank. A sludge discharge port of a sludge recovery tank is 
closed, and air in the tank is discharged through an 
intake/exhaust port provided on the upper portion of the tank 
so that the interior of the tank
