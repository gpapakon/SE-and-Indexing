<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making 
flexographic printing plates and, in particular, to a 
process for making laser engraved single layer, 
flexographic printing plates and also of concern are 
laser engravable single layer flexographic printing 
elements. Printing plates are well known for use in 
flexographic printing, particularly on surfaces which 
are corrugated or smooth, such as packaging materials, 
e.g., cardboard, plastic films, etc. Typically, flexographic printing plates which have 
heretofore been used are those made from vulcanized 
rubber. Rubber was favored because it could be used 
with harsh solvents, it had good ink transfer, high 
elasticity, and high compressibility. Rubber elements 
were made by vulcanizing the rubber in a suitable mold. More recently, it has been possible to laser 
engrave a rubber element directly. Laser engraving has 
provided a wide variety of opportunities to rubber 
printing plates. Highly concentrated and controllable 
energy lasers can engrave very fine details in rubber. 
The relief of the printing plate can be varied in many 
ways. Very steep as well as gently decreasing relief 
slopes can be engraved so as to influence the dot gain 
of such plates.  
 Commercial rubbers can be natural or synthetic. An 
example of synthetic rubber includes ethylene-propylene-diene 
monomer elastomers (EPDM), which can be used to 
make a laser engravable flexographic printing element. 
Elements made from natural or synthetic rubbers require 
vulcanization with sulfur, a sulfur-containing moiety, 
or peroxide to effect chemical crosslinking. Such 
materials will hereinafter be referred to as "rubber". 
In addition, such vulcanized elements require grinding 
to obtain uniform thickness and a smooth surface 
suitable for printing. This is extremely time consuming 
and labor intensive. U.S. Patent 3,549,733 issued to Caddell on 
December 22, 1970, describes a method for producing 
polymeric printing plates. The printing plate is made 
by exposing a layer of the polymeric material to a 
controlled laser beam of sufficient intensity to ablate 
the polymer and form depressions in the surface. This invention relates to a process for making a 
single layer flexographic printing plate which comprises 
(a) reinforcing an elastomeric layer situated on 
top of a flexible support to produce a laser engravable 
flexographic printing element which optionally has a 
removable coversheet situated on top of the elastomeric 
layer, said reinforcement being selected from the group
