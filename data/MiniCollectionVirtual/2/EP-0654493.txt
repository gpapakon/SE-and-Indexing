<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing peroxidic perfluoropolyethers by oxidation 
of tetrafluoroethylene with oxygen, in liquid phase 

comprising a solvent and in the presence of a chemical initiator, 
at a pressure between 2 and 15 absolute atm and 

operating with a molar ratio of the tetrafluoroethylene to 
the chemical initiator higher than 35. The process allows 

to increase the molecular weight of the perfluoropolyethers 
at the same content of peroxidic oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
peroxidic perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes, usually called peroxidic
perfluoropolyethers.As it is known, the peroxidic perfluoropolyethers are
used as initiators of radical polymerizations and as
crosslinking agents for polymers. They can be transformed
into inert perfluoropolyethers (i.e. devoid of peroxidic
groups and reactive terminal groups) which are used as inert
fluids in various applications: "testing" in electronics,
welding in vapour phase and in liquid phase, protection of
the building materials, lubrication, etc. Moreover,
functional perfluoropolyethers, used for instance as
intermediates for polymers, can be obtained from peroxidic
perfluoropolyethers by means of known techniques of chemical
reduction.According to the art, the peroxidic perfluoropolyethers
are normally prepared by reaction of perfluoroolefins with
oxygen under the action of ultraviolet radiations. Lately,
it has been found, however, that the reaction can be carried
out also without using ultraviolet radiations, provided that
a substance acting as initiator of the polymerization, for
instance fluorine and the compounds containing the fluoroxy
group F-O-, is present. This process is disclosed in EP-A-0393700
and EP-A-0393705. By changing the operating modalities, the known
processes without the use of radiation allow to obtain
peroxidic perfluorooxyalkylenes having different structural
characteristics. In particular, by increasing the ratio
between the amounts of monomer and initiator fed to the
process, products with rising molecular weight are obtained;
at the same time, however, the content of peroxidic oxygen
(PO, defined as grams of peroxidic oxygen per 100 g of
product) increases over the acceptability limit, estimable
around a PO value equal to about 4, almost reaching the
danger point set around 4.5-5. Perfluoropolyether products
having molecular weight higher than about 5000 and
contemporaneously with a PO value lower than the above
mentioned maximum acceptability limit cannot practically be
obtained in the absence of ultraviolet radiation.As the peroxidic groups are randomly distributed along
the polymer chains and the terminal groups are not
functional, a functional derivative obtainable by chemical
reduction of the polymer shows characteristics of average
molecular weight (m) and of functionality (f) theoretically
obtainable according to the following relations:

wherein M is the number average molecular weight of the
peroxidic crude product and PO is the value of
