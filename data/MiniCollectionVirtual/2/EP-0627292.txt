<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-feeding
device for use in the production of a molded article
having an excellent appearance free from sink marks and
distortion, by an injection molding method. More specifically,
it relates to a gas-feeding device for feeding
a pressurized gas into a molten resin injected into
a cavity of a mold, attached to an injection molding
machine for producing a molded article having a hollow
portion.For example, JP-A-64-14012 (corresponding to
U. S. Patent 4,740,150) discloses an injection molding
machine used for injection molding a molten thermoplastic
resin for producing a molded article having an
excellent appearance free from sink marks and distortion.
In the injection molding method disclosed in
JP-A-64-14012, as shown in Fig. 1 attached thereto, a
molten plastic material 19 is injected into a mold
cavity 13, then a pressurized gas is fed into the molten
plastic material 19 in the mold cavity 13 to form a
gas-containing hollow portion 25 within the plastic
material 19, and the gas within the gas-containing
hollow portion 25 is released into atmosphere before the
mold is opened.In the gas-feeding device disclosed in the
above JP-A-64-14012, for feeding the pressurized gas
into the molten plastic material 19 in the mold cavity
13, a nozzle 26 is shifted to a forward position as
shown in Fig. 2 attached to JP-A-64-14012. In this
state, a cap 32 of the nozzle 26 is in contact, under
pressure, with a conical valve seat of a valve opening
42 provided to an insert 41 in a lower mold member 12.
The contact of the cap 32 of the nozzle 26 and the valve
seat of the valve opening 42 under pressure can prevent
the molten plastic material 19 injected into the mold 
cavity 13 from leaking around the nozzle 26. Further,
the pressurized gas can be reliably fed into the molten
plastic material 19. When the pressurized gas in the
gas-containing hollow portion 25 is released to atmosphere,
the nozzle 26 is shifted to a backward position
as shown in Fig. 3 attached to JP-A-64-14012. In this
state, the cap 32 of the nozzle 26 is apart from the
valve opening 42, and the gas in the gas-containing
hollow portion 25 is released through the valve opening
42 around the valve 26 and further through a gap formed
by the nozzle 26 and the insert 41 to atmosphere. The
nozzle 26 is shifted under the control of a piston 29
and a cylinder 27.In an injection molding machine having the
above nozzle 26 and valve opening 42, however, the
centerline of the nozzle 26 and the centerline of the
valve opening
