<ABSTRACT>
A rotary engine is provided comprising a housing (12) and a rotor (14) comprising a compression eccentric (20) and a power eccentric (22). Gases are compressed within the space formed by the housing (12), the compression eccentric (20) and a compression gate (72), after being introduced through an intake manifold (28). Gases are transferred from the compression eccentric to the power eccentric through a rotary combustion chamber (36), in which combustion of the gases is initiated by an ignition device. Expanding gases cause rotation of the rotor (14) by expanding in the space formed by the housing (12), power eccentric (22) and a power gate (66). Gases exit from the power eccentric (22) through an exhaust port (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to internal combustion engines, and in 
particular to rotary engines. Needs for more efficient and powerful internal combustion engines are ever 
present. Rotary engines have proven to be important alternatives to conventional 
piston-type engines. The efficiency of an engine is based in part on whether it makes full use of 
the energy available from the expansion of combusted gases. Limitations in the size 
of the available volume for gas expansion during combustion has been a problem in 
making full use of the energy available from the combustion of gases in existing 
rotary engines. Accordingly, one efficiency limitation results when exhaust occurs 
before the combusted gases have completely expanded, i.e., before the power stroke 
has completed. Therefore, a need has arisen for a rotary engine that, through the efficient use 
of space in a same engine, provides a relatively large volume for gas expansion to 
take advantage of the available energy from the combustion of gases. Patent specification US-A-4 739 615 discloses an internal combustion engine 
with a reciprocating suction piston and reciprocating power piston cooperating with 
rotating combustion chambers which receive compressed air and fuel from the 
cylinder of the suction piston and, after complete combustion, discharge into the 
cylinder of the power piston. Patent specification GB-A-1 531 541 discloses a rotary internal combustion 
engine with a cylindrical rotor having two spaced circumferentially extending grooves 
with contact valves which divide up the grooves into induction and compression 
chambers and expansion and exhaust chambers respectively. Patent specification DE-A-822312 discloses an internal combustion chamber 
with twin eccentrics forming separate compression and power chambers and with a 
common crossover chamber. According to the invention there is provided a rotary engine, comprising: 
a housing having two ends and having a bore extending therethrough;  
  a rotor including a compression eccentric and a power eccentric, the eccentrics 
being spaced apart and the rotor being housed within the bore in the housing and 
including an axial shaft;  an intake manifold aligned with the compression eccentric and operable to 
convey gases into a compression space formed between the housing, the compression 
eccentric, and a compression gate, the compression gate being disposed adjacent to 
the compression eccentric and means being provided for maintaining the compression 
gate in sealing
