<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a compound having a 12-lipoxygenase inhibitory effect and a drug selectively inhibiting 
12-lipoxygenase and relates to a novel coumarin derivative represented by general formula (1) and a drug comprising 

said compound as the active ingredient. In formula (1) R¹ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R² and R³ represent each 
hydrogen or hydroxyl provided that R² and R³ do not represent hydrogen atoms at the same time; and Ar represents 

(a) (b), (c) etc.; and R⁴ represents lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl or cyano. It further provides a 
compound which can be converted into another compound capable of selectively inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase activity 

through cleavage and breakage of its modifying moiety 
in vivo
 and a drug which selectively inhibits 12-lipoxygenase 
and relates to a novel coumarin derivative having an acyl group as the modifying moiety and a drug containing 

said compound as the active ingredient. The invention compound, which can potently inhibit 12-lipoxygenase at 
a high selectivity, is useful as a drug for preventing and treating circulatory diseases such as arteriosclerosis and 

vasoconstriction and preventing the metastasis of certain cancers. It has a low toxicity and little exhibits side effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel coumarin
derivatives inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase selectively, and
medicines containing these compounds as effective
ingredients; and furthermore, the present invention
relates to coumarin derivatives having a effect of
inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase activities in the 12-lipoxygenase
pathway selectively, and medicines
containing the compounds as effective ingredients and
having the effect of inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase
selectively being useful as medicines for preventing and
treating various circulatory diseases such as
arteriosclerosis and vasospasm and for preventing the
metastasis of some kinds of cancers (e.g., Lewis lung
cancer).In addition, the present invention relates to novel
coumarin derivatives capable of forming substances
inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase selectively through the
cleavage of their modified moieties in vivo, and
medicines containing these compounds as effective
ingredients; and furthermore, the present invention
relates to coumarin derivatives (hereinafter may be
referred to as precursors) capable of converting to
compounds inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase activities in the
12-lipoxygenase pathway, and medicines containing the
precursors as effective ingredients and having a effect
of inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase selectively being useful
as medicines for preventing and treating various
circulatory diseases such as arteriosclerosis and
vasospasm and for preventing the metastasis of some
kinds of cancers (e.g., Lewis lung cancer).In the present specification, the indication of 
percentage means values by weight unless otherwise
specified, and an IC50 value means a mol concentration
to produce 50 % inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase or 12-lipoxygenase
activities.It is known that there exists a metabolic pathway
called a 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the cascade of
arachidonic acid and that arachidonic acid is converted
to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (hereinafter may
be referred to as 5-HPETE) by the function of 5-lipoxygenase
("Prostaglandin and Morbid States", edited
by Seiitsu Murota, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 1984).It is known that various leukotrienes can be
synthesized by using this compound as an intermediate
("Prostaglandin and Mobid States", edited by Seiitsu
Murota, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 1984), and it is also known
that, for example, leukotriene B4 of these leukotrienes
has a strong activity of leukocyte migration and is a
mediator for inflammation, and that leukotriene C4 and
D4 are mediators for asthma ("Prostaglandin and Morbid
States", edited by Seiitsu
