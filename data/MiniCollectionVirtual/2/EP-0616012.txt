<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to organopolysiloxane 
compositions and more particularly, to fluorinated 
organopolysiloxane compositions, their manufacture and 
use, e.g. as packing, sealing and coating materials in 
electric and electronic fields. In addition to electric insulation, heat resistance, 
low-temperature resistance and weatherability inherent to 
silicone rubber, fluorinated silicone rubbers generally 
have improved surface properties including solvent 
resistance, water repellency, oil repellency and 
releasability, but suffer from poor adhesion to various 
support materials. There is a desire to have new 
fluorinated silicone rubbers available, and particularly 
having acceptable adhesion as well as good surface 
properties.  
 We have found that certain fluorinated cyclic 
organosiloxanes may exert a useful tackifying or adhesion-promoting 
effect in a composition of linear fluorinated 
organopolysiloxane having aliphatic-type unsaturation, 
typically together with organohydrogen polysiloxane for 
crosslinking. The compositions, this use of the cyclic 
organosiloxanes, and methods of preparing the 
compositions, are independent aspects of the disclosure. A specific product proposal herein is an 
organopolysiloxane composition comprising 
(A) a linear fluorinated organopolysiloxane 
having in a molecule at least two 
monovalent hydrocarbon groups each having an 
aliphatic unsaturated bond attached to a silicon 
atom, and further having at least one group 
selected from monovalent perfluoroalkyl and 
monovalent perfluoropolyether groups attached to 
a silicon atom, (B) a cyclic fluorinated organosiloxane of 
the general formula (1): 
  
 
wherein R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted 
monovalent hydrocarbon group having an aliphatic 
unsaturated bond, R2, R3 and R6 are independently 
selected from substituted or unsubstituted 
monovalent hydrocarbon groups free of an 
aliphatic unsaturated bond, R4 and R5 are 
independently selected from substituted or 
unsubstituted divalent hydrocarbon groups free 
of an aliphatic unsaturated bond, Rf is a 
monovalent perfluoropolyether group or 
monovalent perfluoroalkyl group, and letters m 
and n are numbers satisfying n + m = 3, n ≧ 1, 
and m ≧ 1, Other components typically included are (C) an 
organohydrogenpolysiloxane having at least two hydrogen 
atoms attached to a silicon atom in a molecule, and (D) a 
platinum group metal catalyst. The composition is obtainable simply, e.g. by 
blending the above-mentioned components together, 
preferably
