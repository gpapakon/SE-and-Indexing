<ABSTRACT>
Method to produce a composite yarn (11) consisting of at 
least one metallic wire (12) and at least two textile 

threads (13), the method comprising a first step (14) of 
coupling the metallic wire (12) with at least two pre-doubled 

textile threads (13) so as to produce a coupled 
thread (15) in which the metallic wire (12) is positioned in 

an intermediate zone between the two textile threads (13), 
and a second twisting step (16) in which the desired twists 

are imparted to the coupled thread (15), at least the 
metallic wire (12) in the coupling step being unwound by 

being drawn from a hank positioned on a stationary swift. 
Composite yarn (11) which comprises at least one metallic 
wire (12) and at least two textile threads (13) and is 

produced with the above method, at least the metallic wire 
(12) in the coupling step being unwound by being drawn from 

a hank positioned on a stationary swift and being positioned 
in the vicinity of a lateral terminal position in the zone 

of reciprocal contact between the two textile threads (13) 
and being at least partly covered by the textile threads 

(13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method to produce a composite
yarn consisting of textile threads and metallic wire and
concerns also the composite yarn thus produced, as set forth
in the respective main claims.The composite yarn thus produced is employed in the
manufacture of knitted underwear and outer knitted
garments,, shirts, jeans, furnishing fabrics, curtains,
blankets, carpets and other textile products.The state of the art covers various types of composite
yarns consisting of a metallic wire associated with one or
more textile threads. These composite yarns are employed in
the manufacture of fabrics, knitted goods, carpets, etc.
which possess the properties of providing screening against
electromagnetic waves or antistatic properties and earth the
body of the person who wears clothes made with such fabrics.Moreover, these composite yarns are also employed in the
production of fabrics that reduce physical pains associated
with the breaking of bones inasmuch as they make normal the
electrical charge of the body and reduce the differences of
potential occurring in the body, for these differences of
potential are the cause of pains due to the breaking of
bones.The philosophies which lead to the composite textile-metallic
yarns are substantially two in number and affect
the conformation of the metallic component.A first philosophy provides for the use of segments of
metallic wire which are assembled with the textile fibre
component.A second philosophy, from which this invention is derived, 
provides for the use of one or more continuous metallic
wires.The present invention is concerned with composite yarns
employing continuous metallic wire.The prior art document IT-BZ-92A000019 discloses a
composite yarn in which at least two textile threads are
wound on a taut metallic wire, which stays substantially
straight substantially in the centre between the two textile
threads.This kind of yarn can be made only with a cording machine
of the type used to produce cords or with a braiding
machine.The use of these machines entails a high production cost
since these machines are very slow and therefore have a low
output.Other prior art exists which discloses the winding of one
or more textile yarns together with metallic wire; one
method of the prior art is to wind together long textile
fibres or very fine textile threads with metallic wires so
as to produce a composite yarn in which the metallic wire is
positioned at random in the composite yarn.This means that the metallic wire can come readily to the
surface of the
