<ABSTRACT>
Up to now, it has been customary to equip assemblies of the kind described with contact units (100) designed to provide a connection to the internal lines (102) and further contact units (101) to provide a connection to the external lines (103). The internal and external lines are connected to each other by a prefabricated harness whose design will depend on the particular wiring plan. The invention calls for standardized types of assembly with different ratios of internal lines to external lines to be manufactured and equipped with a harness standardized in the same way. This makes it possible to lower manufacturing costs and reduce the time between an order being placed and the assembly being delivered.

Assemblies for installation in distributor racks 
of communications networks, preferably in telephone 

exchanges, in each case one of the modular assemblies 
having a carrier part on which there are held contact 

units (101) with connections of external lines (103), 
leading to subscribers, and contact units (100) with 

connections of internal lines (102), leading to switching 
devices, the contact units (101) for the external lines 

(103) and the contact units (100) for the internal lines 
(102) in each case being combined in regions of the 

assembly which are spatially delimited from one another, 
the number of connections for the external lines (103) 

with respect to the number of connections for the internal 
lines (102) defining a quantitative ratio greater 

than 1, the contact units (100) for the internal lines 
(102) and the contact units (101) for the external lines 

(103) being connected by means of jumpering lines (107), 
which are laid and connected before installation of the 

assembly, it being possible for the jumpering lines (107) 
to be altered and added to after installation into the 

distributor rack, characterized in that the quantitative 
ratio is equal to an integral or half-integral multiple, 

in that for all the assemblies with the same quantitative 
ratio the jumpering lines (107) are connected in accordance 

with a respectively standard wiring plan to the 
contact units (100, 101) for the internal and external 

lines (102, 103), in that the assemblies are inscribed 
with counting numbers assigned to the connection elements 

of the contact units (100, 101), in that the jumpering  
 

lines (107) are connected uninterruptedly in series to 
the connections for the internal lines (102) and the 

other ends of the jumpering lines (107) are connected to 
the connections for the external lines (103) in the same 

sequence as in the case of the internal lines and in a 
counting interval which remains the same and is equal to 

the quantitative ratio, there remaining free between the 
connections for the external lines (103) which are 

occupied by the jumpering lines (107) a number of reserve 
connections which remains the same in each case, and in 

that the assemblies with varying quantitative ratios in 
each case have the same installation connections for 

installation into the distributor racks. 
Assemblies according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that within the region of the contact units (101) for the 

external lines (103) there are formed various subregions, 
in which the jumpering lines (107) are connected to the 

contact units (101) in a respectively varying integral 
counting interval.
