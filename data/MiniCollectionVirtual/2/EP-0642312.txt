<ABSTRACT>
A sampler for delivery of microencapsulated liquid fragrance material is provided that comprises at least one treated paper sheet (12) defining an enclosed cavity. The paper sheet (12) is at least partially treated with a volatile containment treatment (14), wherein the volatile liquid containment treatment (14) is water-stable and organic liquid capsule fill-stable. The enclosed cavity is substantially completely defined by treated portion(s) of the sheet. Microcapsules (20) comprising microencapsulated organic liquid capsule fill are disposed within the cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microencapsulated
fragrance samplers. More particularly, this invention
relates to microencapsulated fragrances provided in a
special reduced odor delivery system.Fragrance samplers comprising a microencapsulated
fragrance and at least one binder layer
between two surfaces are well known in the industry.
These samplers have become a common vehicle for
advertising perfumes and other fragrances through
inserts in magazines and the like. Use of these
fragrance samplers has become objectionable to some
consumers because many samplers have a tendency to
prematurely release some fragrance. This premature
emission may be due to accidental breakage of some
microcapsules during the handling of the inserts or the
magazines themselves, or may be due to the presence of
non-encapsulated fragrance in the sampling device.U.S. Patent No. 4,925,517 discloses the use
of a base coating on a surface to be subsequently
coated with a microcapsule-bearing layer. The base
coating functions in part to control the rate and
degree of penetration of liquid from the carrier for
microcapsules into the underlying paper. Typically the
base coating is softened by the carrier liquid of the
capsule containing slurry as a means of controlling the
bond strength within the sampling device. Preferred
polymers to be used in the base coating are
water-softenable or organic solvent soluble, as
disclosed at column 5, lines 7-15.U.S. Patent No. 4,988,557 discloses a similar
carrier activated base coating that is applied in a
discontinuous pattern to provide separate areas of the 
sampler in which the capsules are ruptured when the
piece is opened, as well as regions in which the
microcapsules may be freely removed.U.S. Patent No. 4,876,136 to Chang, et. al.
discloses a lipstick sampling device that is a three
layered structure to deliver a small amount of lipstick
to a potential customer. The construction comprises a
carrier sheet, a window sheet and a cover sheet. The
carrier sheet may be any film or sheet material, and is
preferably paper that has an oleophobic impregnate or a
barrier layer coated on one side. See column 3, lines
31-37 and column 5, lines 10-32.U.S. Patent No. 4,878,775 to Norbury, et. al.
discloses a dry liquid applicator that is a support
surface with a coating of relatively large
microcapsules and with an overlay of a liquid permeable
top protective layer. The bottom of the support
surface is preferably not readily penetrated by the
liquid in the capsules, and is preferably completely
impermeable to

A sampler for delivery of microencapsulated liquid fragrance
material comprising :


at least one treated paper sheet (12) defining an enclosed cavity,
the paper sheet (12) being at least partially treated with a

polymeric volatile liquid containment treatment (14) wherein said
polymeric volatile liquid containment (14) treatment is water-stable

and organic liquid capsule fill-stable, thereby forming an effective
barrier to oils and water fluids such that the enclosed cavity is

substantially completely defined by treated portion(s) of the sheet ;
and
microcapsules (20), comprising microencapsulated organic liquid
capsule fill, disposed within said cavity, wherein said treated paper

sheet (12) allows the transmission of moisture vapor therethrough.
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein the cavity is formed by
gluing portions of the treated paper together with an adhesive.
A sampler according to claim 2, wherein said adhesive contains
microcapsules that comprise microencapsulated organic liquid capsule

fill.
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein treated portion(s) of the
treated paper are releasably adhered together to form the enclosed cavity.
A sampler according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises:

a cover paper sheet (16) that has been treated with said volatile
liquid containment treatment (14),
means for bonding said cover paper sheet (16) to said substrate
paper sheet (12).
A sampler according to any of claim 1 to 5, wherein said organic
liquid capsule fill is a fragrance. 
A sampler according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein said
polymeric volatile liquid containment treatment is a cross linked polymer.
A sampler according to claim 5, wherein said microcapsules are
strongly bonded to said substrate paper sheet (12) and said cover paper

sheet (16), so that when the cover sheet is removed from the substrate
sheet (12), the microcapsules (20) are ruptured and the fragrance is

released.
A sampler according to claim 5, wherein said microcapsules (20)
are loosely associated with the substrate sheet (12), such that when the

cover sheet (16) is removed the microcapsules are available to be picked
up by a user.
A sampler according to claim 5, wherein said microcapsules are
lightly bound to the substrate sheet (12) by a binder material (22), such

removed by light finger pressure.
A sampler according to claim 5, comprising :

microcapsules (20) that are strongly bonded to said substrate
paper sheet (12) and said cover paper sheet (16) so that when the

cover sheet (16) is removed from the substrate sheet (12), the
microcapsules (20) are ruptured and the fragrance is released ; and
