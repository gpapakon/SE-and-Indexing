A resin composition curable through a Michael reaction 
between (a) a component having a plurality of α,β-unsaturated 

carbonyl groups and (b) a component having a 
plurality of activated methylene, activated methyne or 

hydroxyl groups is disclosed. The curing reaction is 
catalyzed with a quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium 

or tertiary sulfonium salt in the presence of an epoxy 
compound independently added to the composition or 

covalently attached to either component (a) or component 
(b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a curable resin composition
for coating uses. More particularly, it relates to a
resinous composition which cures through a Michael
reaction.Michael reactions comprising a base-catalysed addition of
carboanions to activated unsaturated systems are utilized
in the crosslinking of resinous compositions for use in coating.
Theses compositions are advantageous in that the
Michael reaction gives a chemically stable crosslinking bond
without forming any reaction by-product.Typical examples of prior art include the following
patent literature:
U.S. Patent No. 4,408,018;U.S. Patent No. 5,017,649;U.S. Patent No. 5,084,536;EP-A-0448154JP-A-01/121341 (EP-A-0310011);JP-A-01/204919 (EP-A-0326723);JP-A-01/152117;JP-A-01/167355;JP-A-01/167356; and JP-A-01/229019.Michael reactions in general require a base catalyst
for forming carboanions from active hydrogen sites such as
activated methylene or methyne groups. Most of the prior art
compositions utilizing the Michael reaction for
crosslinking employ a strong base such as alkali metal
hydroxides, alkali metal alkoxides, quaternary ammonium
hydroxides or carbonates, tertiary amines, guanidines,
amidines and tertiary phosphines.Because such strong base catalysts may catalyze the
Michael reaction even at ambient temperature, systems
containing the strong base generally have to be formulated
into a two component composition. The strong base catalyst
may also hydrolyze or otherwise deteriorate resin components
when remained in the films applied on substrates. For
example, amines may cause yellowing of the cured films.
Alkali metal based catalysts are hardly soluble in organic
solvents conventionally used in coating compositions and,
therefore, may result, when used, in cured films of
unsatisfactory appearance.JP-A-01/167356 discloses the use of quaternary ammonium
salts with carboxylic acids. However, the quaternary
ammonium carboxylates themselves have only a weak catalytic
activity and do not promote the crosslinking reaction
satisfactorily when used alone. Halides and other ammonium 
salts have been proven to have no or little catalytic
activity when used alone.JP-A-01/204919 and EP-A-0 326 723 disclose a catalyst system containing a
tertiary amine and an epoxide. The curing mechanism of this
system was explained by the inventors that, unlike the
reaction in the absence of an activated methylene, the
tertiary amine reacts first with the epoxide and then with
a weakly acidic methylene component to form a quaternary
ammonium salt resulting in the
