<DESCRIPTION>
 STRUCTURED SILICATES AND THEIR USE IN AUTOMATIC DISHWASHERSField of InventionThe invention relates to an aqueous liquid composition which is especially useful as detergent compositions. If the water content is low enough, shear thickening is exhibited.Background of the InventionLiquid automatic dishwasher detergent compositions, both aqueous and nonaqueous, have recently received much attention, and the aqueous products have achieved commercial popularity. The acceptance and popularity of the liquid formulations as compared to the more conventional powder products stems from the convenience and performance of the liquid products. However, even the best of the currently available liquid formulations still suffer from two major problems, product phase instability shear sensitivity and bottle residue, and to some extent cup leakage from the dispenser cup of the automatic dishwashing machine.Representative patent art in this area includes Dixit, et al., U.S. Patent5,053,158; Prince, U.S. Patent 5,130,043; Baxter, U.S. Patent 4,950,416; Wise, U.S.Patent 4,941 ,988; Cilley, U.S. Patent 4,933,101 ; Colarusso, U.S. Patent 4,927,555;Gabriel, U.S. Patent 4,859,358; Roselle, U.S. Patent 4,824,590; Rek, U.S. Patent 4,556,504; Bush, et al., U.S. Patent 4,226,736; Ulrich, U.S. Patent 4,431 ,559;Sabatelii, U.S. Patent 4,147,650; Paucot, U.S. Patent 4,079,015; Leikhem, U.S. Patent4,116,849; Milora, U.S. Patent 4,521 ,332; Jones, U.S. Patent 4,597,889; Heile, U.S.Patent 4,521 ,332; Laitem, U.S. Patent 4,753,748; Sabatelii, U.S. Patent 3,579,455;Hynam, U.S. Patent 3,684,772; U.S. Patent 4,836,946; Ahmed et. al., U.S. Patent 

4,889,653; Smeets, U.S. Patent 3,720,621 ; U.S. Patent 4,836,948; and U.K. Patent Applications GB 2,116,199A and GB 240.450A.While the compositions disclosed in the above patents provide satisfactory solutions to the problems of phase instability and bottle residue, as well as cup leakage, it has now been found that under some storage/handling conditions and/or processing conditions, additional improvements would be desirable. Specifically, if the viscoelastic compositions are subjected to repeated heating and cooling cycles, growth of crystals and product thinning and/or precipitate formation has been observed. Chemical analysis of the precipitated crystals has shown that these crystals are comprised predominantly of sodium pyrophosphate. In addition, it appears that the crystals tend to become entangled with the polymeric thickener which tendency is presumed to account for the thinning (shear
