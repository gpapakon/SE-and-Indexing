<ABSTRACT>
A low noise tyre having a block pattern, in which 
the running noise during running on well-paved roads 

at high speed can be reduced without sacrificing 
off-the-road running performance. The tread portion 

(3) is provided with a plurality of 
circumferentially extending main grooves (2) and a 

plurality of axial grooves (4) to divide the tread 
portion into blocks (5) each having a top plane (6) 

and side planes (7,8). The corners (12) of the 
blocks (5) are cut off with a triangular plane (14) 

having a horizontal edge (13A) between the 
triangular plane (14) and the top plane (6) and two 

oblique edges (13A) each between the triangular 
plane (14) and one of said side planes (7,8). The 

height (y) of the radially innermost end of the 
triangular plane (14) from the bottom of the main 

grooves (2) is in the range of from 0.4 to 0.6 times 
the depth of the main grooves (h). The axial and 

circumferential lengths (s) of the horizontal edge 
(13A) are in the range of from 2 to 4 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low noise tyre 
having a block pattern. In off-the-road cars, tyres having a block type 
tread pattern are widely used for their superior 
grip performance. In recent years, as the expressway 
network is developed, the need for off-the-road cars 
with block pattern tyres to run on well-paved 
expressways is increasing. It is required to reduce 
the running noise from such a block pattern tyre 
since the block pattern tyres generate much noise 
when running on well-paved roads at high speed. A running noise from a tread pattern, the so-called 
impact noise, is known. During running, especially 
high speed running, tread blocks repeatedly contact 
with and detach from the ground. As a result, the 
blocks are vibrated, and the vibration is 
transmitted to the tyre sidewall portion and 
amplified to generate audible noise. Further, a so called air resonance noise is known. 
Vibrations of the tread rubber vibrate the air 
existing in the tubes formed between the ground and  
 
the tread grooves in the ground contacting patch, 
and the columns of air resonate at a certain 
frequency. If the depth of the tread grooves is decreased, 
impact noise and resonance noise can be reduced, but 
the road grip performance particularly during off-the-road 
running especially on-the-snow running is 
greatly decreased. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a low noise tyre having a block type 
tread pattern, in which the running noise during 
high-speed running on a well-paved road is reduced 
without sacrificing off-the-road performance 
especially on-the-snow performance. According to the present invention a 
low noise tyre comprises a tread portion, provided 
with a plurality of main grooves extending in the 
tyre circumferential direction and a plurality of 
axial grooves extending in the tyre axial direction 
to divide the tread portion into blocks, each said 
block having a top plane and side planes defining 
corners, characterised in that the corners adjacent 
to the main grooves are cut off by a triangular  
 
plane having a horizontal edge between the 
triangular plane and the top plane and two oblique 
edges each between the triangular plane and one of 
said side planes, the height of the radially 
innermost end of the triangular plane from the 
bottom of the main grooves being in the range of 
from 0.4 to 0.6 times the depth of the main grooves, 
the circumferential length of the horizontal edge 
being in the range of from 2 to 4 mm, and the axial 
lengt
