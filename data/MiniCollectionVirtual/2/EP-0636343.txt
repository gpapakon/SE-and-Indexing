<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a collection assembly useful for collecting small 
quantities of blood. The assembly comprises a container (12) with 

an integrallip for 
facilitating collection of the blood and a cap (14) suitable for 

enclosing the container. The 
assembly further comprises a sealing (67) arrangement for securing the 

cap with the 
container and a cam (46) arrangement for unsecuring the cap (14) from 

the container. The 
container also has a finish on its inner surface (26) that promotes 

mixing of a liquid 
specimen contained therein, when using a mechanical device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collection assembly and, more
particularly, to a microcollection container and cap suitable for collecting small
quantities of blood from a patient and maintaining the blood in secure fashion
for subsequent testing.Analytical instrumentation has made it possible to carry out a variety of 
hematological diagnostic procedures on very small quantities of blood. Because of
this, a patient's finger or earlobe, for example, may be punctured and a very small
quantity of blood may be rapidly collected into a container for such testing.
However, in order to carry out testing and analysis on small quantities of blood, the
blood must be rapidly collected prior to any coagulation thereof.A collection arrangement as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,397,318, has
been provided wherein a cap is configured to fit the top of a microcollection container
with the cap having a removable capillary scoop for engaging the puncture site and
transferring blood to the container. However, with such an arrangement, if precise
positioning is not carried out, capillary action is not initiated or slowed and the
collected blood will clot.Moreover, when a sample is taken with this collection arrangement, blood
droplets may be left in and around the top area of the container. When the scoop is
removed from the cap and the cap is fitted onto the top of the container, the excess
blood may be forced onto the outside surface of the container.Another problem with conventional plastic blood microcollection containers
is that they do not facilitate specimen mixing unless the surface chemistry of the
container is changed to increase wettability. For example, the surface chemistry of
such plastic containers can be changed using O2 plasma treatment and coating the
plastic surface with a surfactant to reduce surface tension. However, changing the
surface chemistry of the plastic blood collection assembly using a surfactant has been
found to adversely affect test parameters and the use of plasma treatment would
undesirably increase the cost of the container. EP-A517,119 describes a container assembly for collecting capillary blood from a
lanced wound. The container includes an integral lip for facilitating collection from the
wound with the entire length of the container from lip to curved closed end being
substantially the same large diameter for rapid collection before coagulation. The
container includes an annular integral skirt enclosing the rounded bottom of the
container to provide a stable surface for

A collection container (12) comprising:

an open top portion (28);
a closed bottom portion (30);
a sidewall (22) extending from said top portion (28) to said bottom portion (30)
having an inner surface (20) and a outer surface (24), said inner surface (26)

promoting mixing of a specimen contained therein; and
an integral collector (34) extending from said top portion (28);

characterized in that the inner surface (22) is textured to promote the mixing, the
texture on said inner surface of said container being a matte finish that decreases

the total interaction between the specimen and said inner surface.
The container of Claim 1, further comprising an annular skirt (37) extending
from said closed bottom portion (30) and said outer surface (24) of said sidewall

(22).
The container of Claim 2, further comprising a lip portion (34) and a receiving
edge (36) associated with said integral collector.
The container of Claim 3, further comprising a locking ring (48) positioned
between said integral collector and a cap seating flange (40) on said outer

surface (24) of said sidewall (22). 
The container of Claim 4, further comprising an upper edge (50) and a lower
edge (52) on said locking ring.
The container of Claim 4, further comprising:

a reservoir (42) positioned within said cap seating flange (40); and
at least one lug (44) positioned within said reservoir (42).
A collection assembly (10) comprising:

a cap (14) comprising a longitudinal axis, a top portion, a bottom portion (54),
an annular skirt (58) extending from said top portion to said bottom portion and

having an inner surface (62) and an outer surface (60), an inner inverted skirt
portion (64) surrounded by said inner surface (62) of said annular skirt (58) and

extending from said top portion toward said bottom portion and an annular
space (68) between said inner surface (62) of said annular skirt (58) and said

inverted skirt portion (64) ; and
a container (12) comprising an open top portion (28) , a closed bottom portion
(30), a sidewall (22) extending from said top portion to said bottom portion and

having an inner surface (26) and an outer surface(24) , an integral collector
extending from said top portion and a cap seating flange (40) associated with

said outer surface of said sidewall,

wherein said inner surface (26) of said container (12) promoting mixing of a
specimen contained therein;

characterized in that the inner surface (22) is textured to promote the mixing, the
texture on said inner surface of said container being a matte finish that decreases

the total interaction between the specimen and said inner surface.
The assembly of Claim 7, further comprising: 

a locking ring (48) on said outer surface of said container (12) positioned
between said integral collector and said cap seating flange;
at least one protrusion (70) positioned on said inner surface of said annular skirt
(58) of said cap (14);
a sealing ring (67) on said inner inverted skirt portion (64) of said cap; and
a rim extending from said outer surface of said annular skirt (58) of said cap;

wherein said protrusion (67) bears against said locking ring (48) of said
container, said sealing ring bears against said inner surface of said top portion of

said container and said rim abuts with said cap seating flange when said cap is
placed over said open top portion of said container.
The assembly of Claim 7 or 8, wherein said matte finish is Society of Plastics
Industry surface finish #4.
