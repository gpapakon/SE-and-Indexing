<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid silicone
compositions curable to rubber. The cured rubber has a
unique combination of properties including unprimed adhesion
to a variety of substrates, such as glass and stainless
steel.Liquid silicone compositions curable to rubber
based upon vinyl-containing polydiorganosiloxane polymer,
organohydrogensiloxanes having silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms
and platinum catalyst are well known in the art of silicone
elastomer compositions. Such compositions are also well
known for their reluctance to adhere to substrates on which
the composition is cured. Many additives have been
developed to improve adhesion of such compositions to a
variety of substrates. However, the additives are, for the
most part, selective to compositions and substrates in which
they are effective. Many approaches are found in the prior
art to solve the problem of adhering such addition-curable
silicone compositions to substrates. Some solutions use the
primer approach and others use the adhesion promoter
approach. While each of these approaches have merit, their
solutions do not provide the rapid cure needed at low
temperatures, good adhesion to both glass and stainless
steel substrates and bond durability under adverse
conditions.The prior art for various combinations of
catalysts and adhesion promoters, primer compositions or
other self-bonding additives is represented by US-A
4,332,844; 4,659,851; 4,719,262; 4,737,562; 4,754,013;
4,906,686; 5,006,580 and 5,023,288. This invention provides a silicone composition
curable to a rubber comprising
(A) 100 parts by weight of an alkenyl-containing
polydiorganosiloxane having an average of at least two
silicon-bonded alkenyl radicals per molecule where the
alkenyl radical has from 2 to 10 inclusive carbon atoms per
radical, each organo radical of the polydiorganosiloxane
being a monovalent radical selected from the group
consisting of hydrocarbon radicals and fluorinated alkyl
radicals both having less than 7 carbon atoms per radical,
the polydiorganosiloxane having triorganosiloxy endgroups,(B) an organohydrogensiloxane having an average of
at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule and
valences of any silicon atom in the organohydrogensiloxane
not satisfied by a hydrogen atom is satisfied by a divalent
oxygen atom or an organo radical wherein each organo radical
is a monovalent radical selected from the group consisting
of hydrocarbon radicals and fluorinated alkyl radicals both
having less than 7 carbon atoms per radical, the
