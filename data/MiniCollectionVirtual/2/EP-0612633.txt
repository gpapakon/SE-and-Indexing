<ABSTRACT>
In an air suspension valve with fine adjustment, in particular for commercial vehicles, means are provided which permit the actuation lever (27) of the air suspension valve to be secured in both horizontal positions (left-hand and right-hand version). A fixed fork (39) is provided in the horizontal position on the housing (1) of the air suspension valve, which fork (39) permits one horizontal position of the actuation lever (27) to be secured with the aid of securing means (pin), the neutral position of the inlet valve and outlet valve in the interior of the air suspension valve being adjustable in this horizontal position. In the position opposite of the housing, a fork (41) which is adjustable in its position relative to the housing is provided, which fork (41) serves to adjust the opposite horizontal position of the actuation lever and to secure it when the inlet valve and outlet valve of the air suspension valve are in the neutral position.
