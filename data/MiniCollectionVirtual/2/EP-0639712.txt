<ABSTRACT>
The filter (40) of a compressor (10) is located in the casing (12) 
of the 

compressor. The fluid path includes passages in the 
casing (12) such that brazed connections are not required 

between the filter (40) and the parts requiring lubrication.

<DESCRIPTION>
In refrigeration compressors the affinity between 
refrigerant and lubricant generally requires separation of 
oil from the discharged refrigerant and its return to the 
compressor. Additionally, the returned oil is normally 
filtered before being supplied to the oil distribution 
structure. Because the filter must be accessible for 
replacement as well as isolatable to minimize oil loss, it 
is located external to the compressor. This, however, 
requires brazed lines downstream of the filter and this 
can result in debris being carried to the bearings, etc. A filter housing is part of the compressor casting 
allowing for a single oil entry location to the 
compressor. The filter is sealed to a check valve 
assembly. The check valve assembly prevents back flow 
when the filter is being changed. A solenoid valve is 
located downstream of the check valve but upstream of the 
bearings and running gear of the compressor which require 
lubrication. Accordingly, the solenoid must be opened to 
permit supplying lubricant. It is an object of this invention to supply proper 
filtration of oil as close as possible to the compressor 
wear surfaces. It is another object of this invention to eliminate 
brazing downstream of the filter. These objects, and 
others as will become apparent hereinafter, are 
accomplished by the present invention. Basically, a filter is located within the compressor 
casing such that passages in the casing can form at least 
part of the lubrication supply path which serially 
includes a filter, a check valve and a solenoid valve.  
 
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a portion of a compressor 
employing the present invention; Figure 2 is a sectional view of the check valve assembly; Figure 3 is a view of the valve member; and Figure 4 is a view of the snap ring. In Figure 1, the numeral 10 generally designates a 
compressor having a casing 12. An opening is formed in 
casing 12 and serially includes threaded portion 12-1, 
bore 12-2, shoulder 12-3 and threaded bore 12-4. Threaded 
bores 12-5 and 12-6 communicate with bore 12-3. Bore 12-7 
communicates with bore 12-4 and bore 12-8 communicates 
with the compressor's bearings, running gear, etc. As best shown in Figure 2, check valve assembly 20 
includes a body 22. Body 22 has bores 22-1 and 22-3 with 
valve seat 22-2 therebetween. Annular recess 22-4 is 
formed in bore 22-3. Body 22 is divided by annular flange 
portion 22-5. One portion of body 22 has an annular 
groove 22-6 and a threaded portion 22-7. The other 
portion of body 22

<CLAIMS>
Compressor means (10) including: 

casing means (12); 
a first bore (12-3) in said casing means and 
having a first and a second end; 
a means (44) for fluidly sealing said first end 
of said first bore; 
a second bore (12-4) in said casing means having 
a first end and a second end; 
a check valve assembly (20) secured in said 
second bore and permitting flow from said first bore to 

said second bore; 
filter means (40) located in said first bore and 
sealingly connected to said check valve assembly; 
a return line (32) connected to said first bore 
means whereby oil returning via said return line enters 

said first bore and passes through a flow path serially 
including said filter means, said check valve assembly and 

said second bore for providing lubrication to said 
compressor means. 
The compressor means of claim 1 wherein 
said flow path downstream of said second bore serially 

includes a third bore (12-7) in said casing means, 
solenoid valve means (50) and a fourth bore (12-8) in sa
id 
casing means whereby said solenoid valve means selectively 

permits flow through said flow path from said third bore 
to said fourth bore while said check valve assembly 

prevents flow from said second bore to said first bore. 
The compressor means of claim 1 wherein 
said check valve assembly includes: 


a first portion (22-7) extending into said 
second bore and secured therein; 
a second portion (22-10) extending into said  
 

first bore and adapted to receive said filter means 
thereover; and, 
a check valve member (24) adapted to only permit 
flow from said second portion to said first portion. 
The compressor means of claim 3 wherein 
said first portion is threadably received in said second 

bore. 
The compressor means of claim 3 wherein 
said check valve assembly further includes valve seat 

means (22-2) and said check valve member is held in place 
by a snap ring (26) secured in said first portion.
