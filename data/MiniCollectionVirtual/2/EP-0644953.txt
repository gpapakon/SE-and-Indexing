<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor wafer processing apparatus (10) or module for a cluster tool is provided with a single wafer rotating susceptor (40) that thins the gas boundary layer to facilitate the transfer of material to or from the wafer (44), in, for example, CVD for blanket or selective deposition of tungsten or titanium nitride, and degassing and annealing processes. Preferably, a downwardly facing showerhead (35) directs a gas mixture from a cooled mixing chamber (30) onto a rapidly rotating wafer (44), for example at from 500 to 1500 RPM, thinning a boundary layer for gas flowing radially outwardly from a stagnation point (198) at the wafer center. Smoothly shaped interior reactor surfaces include baffles (90, 101, 102) and plasma cleaning electrodes (80, 90) to minimize turbulence. Inert gases from within the rotating susceptor (40) minimize turbulence by filling gaps in structure, prevent contamination of moving parts, conduct heat between the susceptor and the wafer (44), and vacuum clamp the wafer to the susceptor (40). A susceptor lip (162) surrounds the wafer (44) and is removable for cleaning, to accommodate different size wafers, and allows change of lip materials to different processes, such as, one which will resist deposits during selective CVD, or one which scavenges unspent gases in blanket CVD. The lip smooths gas flow, reduces thermal gradients at the wafer edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) reactors for the processing
of semiconductor wafers, and particularly to CVD
reactor modules for semiconductor wafer processing
cluster tools. More particularly, the present
invention is applicable to the CVD of coating
materials such as tungsten, titanium nitride and
other metal and dielectric substances onto silicon
semiconductor wafers, and to other silicon
processes in which mass transport is a present but
not controlling characteristic of the process.In the manufacture of semiconductor
wafers and of other similarly manufactured
articles, sequences of processes including coating,
etching, heat treating and patterning are
sequentially employed. Most of these processes
involve the chemical or physical addition or
removal of material to or from a surface of a
substrate, usually transported as a vapor. Certain coating processes in such
sequences are performed by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD). CVD is preferred, for example,
in applying films to the differently facing
surfaces of holes through underlying layers, as,
for example, to apply conductive films for the
purpose of making interconnections across
insulating layers and the like.The ultimate result of CVD processes for
filling holes or vias, and for forming
interconnections between layers on semiconductor
wafers, is frequently the selective deposition of
the film, that is, formation of a permanent film on
only selected portions of the wafer surfaces.
Direct selective application by CVD of such
coatings is often unreliable, unsuccessful, or
slow, and thus undesirable on a commercial scale,
where rapid throughput and efficient use of
expensive machinery is important. Therefore,
selective end product films are often applied in
blanket fashion and then etched back from the areas
where permanent film is undesired.Blanket CVD of materials, such as
tungsten, followed by an etching back of the
deposited material, requires a high degree of
uniformity in the blanket film, particularly on the
areas of a substrate from which the material is to 
be etched. If the coating is irregular in the
etch-back areas, the etching process may
selectively damage the underlying layers in regions
of the wafer where the blanket film to be etched is
thin, or may result in regions where residual film
remains. CVD reactors of the prior art have coated
substrates with limited uniformity, or at limited
speed. Accordingly, more uniform application of
the films and higher speed CVD reactors,
particularly for blanket
