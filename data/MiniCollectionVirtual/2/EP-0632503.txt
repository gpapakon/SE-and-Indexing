<ABSTRACT>
An integrated edge structure for a high voltage 
semiconductor device comprising a PN junction represented by a 

diffused region (3,7) of a first conductivity type extending 
from a semiconductor device top surface is described. The edge 

structure comprises a first lightly doped ring (4) of the first 
conductivity type obtained in a first lightly doped epitaxial 

layer (2) of a second conductivity type and surrounding said 
diffused region (3,7), and a second lightly doped ring (8) of 

the first conductivity type, superimposed on and merged with 
said first ring (4), obtained in a second lightly doped 

epitaxial layer (6) of the second conductivity type grown over 
the first epitaxial layer (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing
a high voltage semiconductor device.High voltage semiconductor devices include PN junctions
which must withstand high reverse voltages; an example is
represented by the base-collector junction of a bipolar NPN
transistor.Most of PN junctions fabricated by planar technology
essentially consist of a first semiconductor region of a given
conductivity type diffused into a second semiconductor region
of opposite conductivity type. An insulating oxide Layer is
superimposed to the two regions and metal contacts are provided
for electrical connection of the two semiconductor regions.A depletion region is associated with the PN junction, which
can be considered as made up of two regions, a first one along
the plane portion of the junction, a second one at the edges of
said plane portion. The electric field has a different
behaviour in the two regions. In the plane portion the
equipotential lines are parallel to the junction, the maximum
electric field is located at the junction and the breakdown
occurs when it reaches the critical value Ecrit. At the
junction edges, because of the finite junction depth, the
equipotential lines are curved, and less spaced than in the
plane portion. As a consequence, the electric field increases,
higher electric fields are associated with smaller curvature
radii, i.e. shallower junctions. The breakdown voltage of a PN 
diffused junction is usually lower than that of the
corresponding plane junction, since the electric field in the
edge region is much higher. The ratio between the breakdown
voltage of the edge and the plane portion is thus below the
unity.Several techniques have been developed to increase said
ratio, essentially by changing the size of the depletion layer
so to avoid local increases in the electric field which can
lead to early breakdown.In one of said techniques, the metal contact of the diffused
region of the junction is extended over the insulating oxide
layer; in this way, a metal field-plate is formed which, acting
as a shield, forces the equipotential lines to extend over a
wider region, thus reducing the electric field. The high
density of the equipotential lines in the oxide Layer does not
represent a problem, because of the higher dielectric strength
of the oxide layer with respect to the silicon. At the metal
field-plate edge, however, the shielding action ceases, with an
increase of the electric field in the surface region.To reduce the surface electric field, the metal field-plate
can be
