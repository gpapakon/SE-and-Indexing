<ABSTRACT>
Following soldering of electrical components on a 
circuit card in a soldering process that includes use of an 

aqueous-based flux, the circuit card, containing the soldered 
electrical components, is exposed to a dilute aqueous 

basic solution prior to a final hot water rinse. The dilute 
basic solution prevents the formation of a white residue 

commonly associated with the use of aqueous-based 
fluxes. For example, using a flux consisting essentially 

of an aqueous solution of citric acid, and rinsing in either 
an aqueous ammonia solution consisting essentially of 

about 20 to 250 ppm ammonium hydroxide or an aqueous solution 
of about 0.1 to 3 wt% sodium bicarbonate, prevents 

formation of the white residue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soldering electrical 
components on circuit cards, and, more particularly, to a 
process for preventing a white residue, commonly associated 
with soldering using an aqueous-based flux, from forming. In the soldering of electrical components on circuit 
cards using an aqueous-based flux, a "white residue" has 
been observed when rinsing the soldered circuit card to 
remove flux residues. While the white residue was believed 
in the past to be the result of using the aqueous fluxing 
agent, more recent indications are that the white residue 
is a result of residual products from the plating process 
used to form the conductive traces on the circuit card. The white residue is objectionable, due not only to 
the appearance, but also because the composition is unknown, 
and this raises a concern that the residue may 
somehow be a corrosion product or be corrosive to the soldered 
joints. Attempts have been made over the years to 
get rid of the residue, all to no avail. For example, detergents 
and surfactants have variously been employed, 
typically in hot water solutions. Thus, there is a need for a process that can be incorporated 
in a soldering/cleaning process employing an 
aqueous-based flux that would prevent the formation of such 
a white residue.  In accordance with the invention, following soldering, 
the circuit card, containing the soldered electrical components, 
is exposed to a dilute basic solution prior to a 
final water rinse. The dilute basic solution prevents the 
formation of the white residue. When cleaning circuit cards after wave soldering with 
a water-soluble flux, the circuit cards are pre-rinsed in 
a dilute solution of a weak base, such as ammonium hydroxide 
(NH₄OH) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃). The circuit 
cards are then processed through the remainder of the conventional 
cleaning cycle, which includes exposure to a water, 
usually deionized, bath. In one example, a dilute aqueous solution of ammonia, 
ranging from about 20 to 250 ppm, has been found to eliminate 
the white residue. Less than about 20 ppm of ammonia 
does not prevent the formation of the white residue. A 
concentration of greater than about 250 ppm of ammonia results 
in the onset of the characteristic ammonia odor, 
which is objectionable to human operators. A concentration 
of ammonia in water in the range of about 20 to 250 ppm is 
odorless, and hence desirable. Ammonia is used in the form of ammonium hydroxide and 
is dissolved in water to the desired concentration. For
