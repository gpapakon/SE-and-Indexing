<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photoelastic stress 
analysis, which has for many years been the only tool 
available to the experimental stress analyst capable of 
providing full-field stress analysis away from the 
external surface. The technique has become extremely well 
refined permitting structures of great complexity to be 
modelled. As a result it has become very useful for 
verification of finite element models where contact and 
interference stresses are present. Techniques such as SPATE (Stress Pattern Analysis by 
Thermal Emission) and Holography have received much 
attention lately but suffer inherently from the 
limitations that they can only examine external surfaces, 
and do not measure the variable of greatest interest, 
shear stress, which is generally considered in most 
engineering stress models as being the most damaging. 
SPATE measures the sum of the principle stresses and 
Holography either in-plane or out-of-plane displacement 
depending on the optical configuration. Shear stress is 
equal to the difference in principle stresses. However, because of the great skill required in 
interpreting the photoelastic data and the time taken, the 
two techniques mentioned above have received greater 
popularity despite their own particular drawbacks.  
 Photoelastic stress analysis is a technique which allows a 
complete stress analysis to be carried out on scale models 
of components and structures. The model, made of a suitable material such as Araldite, 
can be stressed either by being held under a load, or by 
having the stress "frozen" into it by applying a load to 
it and oven heating it so that the stress remains when the 
load is removed. Under strain the Araldite becomes 
birefringent, and polarised light produced with a light 
source and a polariser and passed through the model is 
split into two components; one in the direction of the 
algebraic maximum principal stress, σ1, and one in the 
direction of the algebraic minimum principal stress, σ2. 
The refractive index of the material is proportional to 
the level of stress, so each component will pass through 
the model with a velocity which is dependant on the 
corresponding principal stress. Therefore, if σ1 is 
greater than σ2, there will be a phase lag between the 
emerging component waves, which can be used to calculate 
the magnitude of (σ1-σ2), and hence the magnitude of 
the shear stress, τ. The model can tnen be viewed through an analyser which 
will allow through only one component, for example the 
horizontal
