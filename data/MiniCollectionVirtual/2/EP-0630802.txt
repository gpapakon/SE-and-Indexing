<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The pressure locks based on engagement into the spokes of the back wheel particularly and padlocks and pivoting-shackle, steel-cable and chain locks are easily accessible from outside and are therefore easy to eliminate or put out of operation by means of a suitable tool. The new safety device is to be of difficult access and simple and robust in construction and mode of operation and is therefore to afford increased safety. 2.2. Fastened preferably in the seat tube of the bicycle frame, near the pedal-bearing shaft reinforced with a bead-like thickening and provided with depressions, is a guide sleeve which has an adjusting member which can be actuated via the lock cylinder of a cylinder lock and of which the rotation as a result of the locking of the lock puts a locking bolt, arranged axially displaceably in the guide sleeve, under spring pretension in the direction of the pedal-bearing shaft and presses it into a depression of the pedal-bearing shaft located opposite the locking bolt. 2.3. The safety device is suitable for ladies' and mens' bicycles of the customary types and sizes.
