<DESCRIPTION>
 SKIN LIGHTENING AGENTSThe present invention relates to compounds from natural biological materials such as plant material which display unexpectedly good skin lightening properties and their use as skin lightening agents.There are three main uses for skin lighteners; to lighten age spots (liver spots or senile lentigo), to reduce the brown-black colour of non- Caucasian skin and to prevent the darkening of Caucasian and Japanese skins. The main mechanism of action is believed to involve inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase that is involved in the metabolism of tyrosine into melanin in the melanocytes present in the skin. Therefore, to be effective, it is desirable that a skin lightener should inhibit mammalian tyrosinase effectively, should be permeable through both the cell and melanocyte membranes and should be safe and non-toxic to skin cells at the concentration it is to be used at.Commonly used skin lighteners are hydroquinone, arbutin and kojic acid. Hydroquinone is the most effective but has significant adverse effects so that it is no longer registered for use in the EC. Many other materials have also been used or documented as skin lighteners, including lactic acid, ferulic acid and nicotinamide as well as plant extracts such as Bearberry extract. Other skin lighteners include glycosides and esters of hydroxy salicylic acid, ascorbyl methylsilanol and liquorice extracts.The use of caffeic acid or an ester or amide thereof to depigment the skin is described in US 5164185. Depigmenting compositions containing di- or tri- caffeoylquinic acid are disclosed in US 5445816. 

The naturally occurring compound ferulic acid is known to have skin lightening activity. Ferulic acid is a phenylpropenyl molecule.According to the invention, there is provided the use of a compound having the following formula I in the manufacture of a composition for use as a skin lightening agent:wherein R1 is CH = CH2 , COOH or CH2-CH3 ; R3 is OH, or -OCH3; R4 is OH; and R2, R5and R6 are all hydrogen,the compound of formula I optionally being in the form of a salt (including mono- , di- or poly- valent salts), when it contains a COOH and/or OH group.Preferably in the compounds of formula I, R1 is CH=CH2, COOH or CH2-CH3.The compound of formula I is preferably selected from vinylguaiacol, protocatechuic acid and ethylguaiacol. More preferably, the compound is vinylguaiacol or protocatechuic acid, most preferably vinylguaiacol. 

By "skin lightener" we include the meaning that the compound inhibits melanogenesis, especially the
