<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for controlling one or more ventilation units (Vent) for an air-conditioning installation for a building for rearing livestock, which system comprises a control unit (UC) designed to determine values of a regulation signal (Sre) as a function of one or more climatic variables measured by at least one probe (STi, STe, Sh) and as a function of set parameters (C1, Cn) and to deliver the said regulation signal (Sre) to the said ventilation unit or units (Vent). It further comprises a conversion circuit (CT) for delivering to the said or to each ventilation unit (Vent) a control signal (Sc) whose value is deduced from the value of the regulation signal (Sre) determined by the control unit (UC) by application of a transfer function defined by at least three pairs or at least three parameters, and means (CI) for allowing the user to supply the said transfer function to the said system.
