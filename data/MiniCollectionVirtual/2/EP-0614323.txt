<ABSTRACT>
The method involves the steps of establishing on request of a first 
DTE to a second remote DTE a set of n independent digital communication 

channels between said terminal adapters, and determining during an 
initialization phase the relationship between the slot of each channel 

used for the building of said aggregation superchannel and the 
chronologic order of the establishment of the considered slot. Then, the 

high-rate data flow is splitted and each byte is transmitted through the 
independent digital channels in accordance with the chronologic order 

which was previously assigned to each of the said channels. In the 

remote DTE, each byte of the splitted high-rate data flow are received 
through the different independent digital channels and are loaded in a 

single memory at an address which is computed from the following 
formula:



A(n)= A(n-1) + n 



 
Where A(n-1) corresponds to the address in which is stored the preceding 

byte conveyed through the considered channel, and n corresponds to the 
number of digital channels established. Therefore, each channel works 

independently and there is no need to measure any delay between the 
channels. The memory storage will contain at continuous addresses the 

high-rate data flow. Applied to a ISDN, fractional T1 or multi-channel 
E1, the method provides an aggregate link operating a nx64 kpbs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the telecommunication field and
more particularly to a method for transmitting an unique
high-rate digital data flow over n separate independent
digital communication channels.FR-A-2 634 082 and EP-A-0 414 950 relate to processes for
establishing a high communication link by means of
independent channels.Integrated Services Digital Network (I.S.D.N) is an
international communications standard that makes it possible
to deliver multiple services in addition to the normal
telephone (voice) service - so that fax, video, data and all
kinds of images can be transmitted to a terminal over a
single line. The ISDN is provided by public network operators
at both national and international levels which offer a
choice of Basic or Primary Rate access to the ISDN network.
The basic access (also called 2B+D) provides two 64 kbps
channels for voice or data communications plus one extra D
channel for the controlling and the monitoring of the
transmission, giving an aggregate speed of 144 Kbp. The
primary rate (which is called 30B+D) offers up to 30
simultaneous 64 Kbps B-channels and one 64 kbps D channel for
an aggregate speed of 2,048 Kbps (referred to as El) or 23
simultaneous 64 Kbps B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel for
an aggregate speed of 1,53 Kbps in the case of a T1 primary
channel. The performances offered by the ISDN networks, and particularly
the speed provided by the primary rate will allow
the developpement of powerfull and effective multimedia
applications in which data, images and voice will be processed.
However, in order to ensure that a maximum number
of different software applications take advantage of the
substantial performances of the ISDN networks, it is highly
desirable that multiple different telecommunication
links having a wide range of different speeds be provided.European patent application n[ 91480136.0 entitled "Apparatus
for connecting a communicating equipment to a digital
communication network having at least two digital
communication channels" filed on August 29th 1991, not
published at the date of filing of the present patent
application and assigned to the assignee of the present
application discloses an apparatus providing the aggregation
of two B-channels in order to provide a single 144
kbps channel which is fully transparent to the application.
However, it this system it remains necessary to
measure the delay which exists between the different channels
forming the required aggregate channel. Therefore, in
view of the different possible requirements
