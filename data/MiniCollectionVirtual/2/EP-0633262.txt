<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel ring fused indole-2,3-dione oxime derivatives,
to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, to the use of these
compounds for the manufacture of a medicament, and to a method of preparing the novel compounds of
the invention.It is an object of the present invention to provide novel isatin derivatives which are useful in the treatment of
diseases in mammals, including a human, and especially in the treatment of diseases which can be treated
by antagonizing an excitatory amino acid of such mammal.Another object of the present invention is to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of
diseases in mammals, including a human, responsive to the blockade of glutamic and aspartic acid
receptors.Excessive excitation by neurotransmitters can cause the degeneration and death of neurons. It is believed
that this degeneration is in part mediated by the excitotoxic actions of the excitatory amino acids (EAA)
glutamate and aspartate at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
propionic acid (AMPA) receptor, and the kainate receptor. This excitotoxic action is responsible
for the loss os neurons in cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral ischemia or cerebral infarction
resulting from a range of conditions, such as thromboembolic or haemorrhagic stroke, cerebral vasospasm,
hypoglycaemia, cardiac arrest, status epilepticus, perinatal asphyxia, anoxia such as from drowning,
pulmonary surgery and cerebral trauma as well as lathyrism, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases.The compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, epilepsy, 
anxiety, pain and drug addiction.EP A 529636, published March 3, 1993, and EP A 522494, published January 13, 1993, discloses certain
isatineoxime derivatives.The invention then, inter alia, comprises the following, alone or in combination:A compound having the formula

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof
wherein
R4 and R5 independently represent hydrogen, halogen, CF3, CN, NO2 or a group of the formula
SO2NR1R2 wherein R1 and R2 independently represent hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl which may be straight or
branched, or C3-C7-cycloalkyl,and RII represents hydrogen, benzyl, -(C=O)CF3, C1-6-carboxylic acid acyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-alkyl
which may be straight or branched, or CH2CO2RVI wherein RVI represents hydrogen or C1-C6-alkyl which
may be straight or branched, anda compound as above wherein R4 is hydrogen, R5 is hydrogen and RII is methyl
