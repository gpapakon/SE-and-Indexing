<ABSTRACT>
A closed system suction catheter assembly has a valve 3 controlling suction applied at the 
patient end of the assembly. The valve 3 has a barrel 61, 61' with a bore 62, 62' and is 

rotatable in a housing 50, 50' between an open position, in which the bore is aligned the inlet 
51 and outlet 5 of the valve and a closed position, in which it is out of alignment. The barrel 

61, 61' has teeth on its outer surface forming a pinion 63, 70 that are engaged by teeth on a 
rack 60, 71 on a switch 58, 72. Actuation of the switch 58, 72 rotates the barrel 61, 61' and 

controls flow through the valve 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to suction catheter assemblies including a suction catheter and a 
valve connected to the catheter to control flow of fluid along the catheter, the valve 
including a housing having an inlet and an outlet and a valve member mounted in the housing. The invention is more particularly concerned with medical suction catheter assemblies 
including valves which can be used for aspirating secretions from the respiratory system or 
tracheal tubes or, for example, for removing blood and debris from surgical sites. Suction catheter assemblies of this kind are connected to the inlet of a container, the 
outlet of the container being connected to a vacuum pump so that a reduced pressure is 
created in the container which in turn applies suction to the catheter. In such systems, the 
vacuum pump generally operates continuously and the catheter includes a valve by which 
suction at the tip of the catheter can be controlled. In its simplest form, the valve comprises 
an aperture in the wall of the catheter which, when open, allows air to enter the catheter and 
thereby prevents any significant suction effect at the tip. The aperture can be closed, when 
desired, by the thumb of the user, or by a movable flap, so that the suction effect is confined 
to the tip of the catheter. Examples of such catheters are described in US 3,911,919 and US 4,468,216. The 
problem with this form of valve is that the suction control aperture provides a path through 
which contaminated material sucked into the catheter can leak out. This is a significant 
disadvantage in view of the present concern about cross-infection and the transmission of 
infectious diseases. In order to reduce the risk of escape of material, catheters have been made which 
include a sealed valve. Examples of suction catheters with a push-down spool valve are  
 
shown in US 4,680,026, US 4,526,573 and US 4,502,508. A suction catheter with a resilient 
valve member is described in US 4,569,344. Many other forms of suction catheter with 
different suction control valves are also known. One problem with these valves is that they have as a part of their sealing system an 
obstruction to flow. The obstruction is created by the stem which connects the spool, plunger 
or other seal to the manually-actuable button by which the valve is operated. In some valves 
the stem itself creates the seal. The obstruction created by the stem causes the fluid flow path 
to be split into two paths around opposite sides of the stem. This does not permit the free

A suction catheter assembly including a suction catheter (1) and a valve (3) connected 
to the catheter to control flow of fluid along the catheter, the valve including a 

housing (50, 50') having an inlet (51) and an outlet (5) and a valve member (61, 61') 
mounted in the housing, characterised in that that the valve member (61, 61') has a 

fluid passageway (62, 62') therethrough, that the valve member (61, 61') is rotatable 
about an axis transverse to the fluid passageway, that the valve includes a manually-actuable 

member (58, 72) mounted for linear movement relative to the housing (50, 
50') along a path transverse to the axis of rotation of the valve member (61, 61'), that 

the valve member and the manually-actuable member (58, 72) have respective 
contacting surfaces (63, 60) such that displacement of the manually-actuable member 

(58, 72) effects rotation of the valve member (61, 61'), and that the manually-actuable 
member (58, 72) is movable from a first position, in which the fluid passageway (62, 

62') through the valve member (61, 61') is aligned with the inlet (51) and outlet (5) of 
the housing so that fluid can flow through the valve, to a second position, in which the 

fluid passageway (62, 62') is out of alignment with the inlet or outlet (51 or 5) so that 
fluid is prevented from flowing through the valve. 
A suction catheter assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that the contacting 
surfaces each have teeth that engage each other. 
A suction catheter assembly according to Claim 2, characterised in that the teeth are 
provided on a rack on the manually-actuable member and by a pinion on the valve 

member. 
A suction catheter assembly according to Claim 3, characterised in that the pinion is 
formed around a circumference of the valve member. 
A suction catheter assembly according to Claim 3, characterised in that the pinion is a 
pinion gear at one end of the valve member. 
A suction catheter assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the inlet and outlet are axially aligned, and that the manually-actuable 

member is movable parallel to the axis of the inlet and outlet. 
A suction catheter assembly according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the inlet and outlet are axially aligned, and that the manually-actuable member is 

movable transversely of the axis of the inlet and outlet. 
A suction catheter assembly according to Claim 7, characterised in that the manually-actuable 
member includes a thumb pad at one end such that by pushing down on the 

thumb pad the manually-actuable member is moved down and transversely of the axis 
of the inlet and outlet.
