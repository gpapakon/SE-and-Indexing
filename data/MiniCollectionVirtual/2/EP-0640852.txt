<ABSTRACT>
A device and method of organizing optical fiber for 
attachment to a component. Two flanges are mounted on a 

base plate. The flanges are shaped concave toward each 
other. The base plate is hinged to the housing of the 

component. A fiber is slipped through a notch into the 
space between the flanges and looped under the flanges. 

The fiber is then attached to the component. The base 
plate is rotated to be substantially parallel to the face 

of the component and clasped in the closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
organizing optical fibers. Optical fibers can carry light signals from one point 
to another. Such fibers are presently being used to carry 
telecommunication signals from one component of a 
telecommunication system to another. Optical fibers can 
carry more signals over higher bandwidths in the same 
amount of space than traditional electrical wires. To reduce the space taken up by them, the fibers are 
bundled together and covered with a sheath to form an 
optical cable. In general, the cable manufacturer cuts 
the fibers and attaches an optical connector to the end of 
each fiber so that all the fibers in a single cable are of 
the same length. In use, the fibers of a single cable 
often need to reach different distances. Consequently, 
the fiber that needs to span the shortest distance often 
has excess length. Even if the fibers are cut to 
different lengths, there is often excess fiber length to 
ensure that all the fibers will reach from one component 
to the other. It is difficult, however, to cut fibers and 
mount new optical connectors in the field. Such field 
terminations take a long time, are expensive to do and, at 
best, result in connections of inconsistent quality. 
Consequently, the excess fiber is generally allowed to 
hang loosely about the components. Since the fiber is 
stiff, it will often protrude from the component, 
extending beyond the desired footprint of that component. This excess fiber length may cause the fiber to snag 
on a passerby and be broken, or get tangled with the other 
fibers, as well as extend beyond the desired footprint of  
 
the electronic equipment or component. When many fibers 
are connected to a piece of electronic equipment, it can 
be difficult to determine which fiber is which. Further, 
leaving the fibers exposed may result in someone hitting 
the fibers, bending them beyond their acceptable bending 
radius, and destroying their ability to carry optical 
signals clearly. Optical fibers have a natural stiffness and 
elasticity which cause them to resist bending and return 
to a straight condition. Because of this, an optical 
fiber extends straight out from the component to which it 
is mounted. However, if the fiber is bent too much (i.e., 
beyond its bending radius), the signal quality may be 
compromised. Further, the reliability of the fiber may 
also be compromised. Consequently, optical fibers can not 
simply be bent to run along the side of the component, 
like electrical wires. It is therefore
