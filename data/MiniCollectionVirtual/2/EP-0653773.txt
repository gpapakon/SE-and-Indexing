<ABSTRACT>
The x-ray target assembly (22) comprises an x-ray target 
member (24) having an opening (27) disposed therethrough 

and a support member (28) having: a mounting surface 
(30) disposed
 transversely to the axis (32) of rotation, 
a lower surface (29) of the target member (24) being 

disposed on the mounting surface (30); and, a threaded 
stem (53) extending from said mounting surface (30) 

through the opening (27). The support member (28) also 
comprises a nut (54) receiving the threaded stem (53) 

and engaging an upper surface (26) of the target member 
(24). Brazing material (36) is disposed at the threaded 

interface between the nut (54) and the threaded stem (53) of the 
support member (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates 
to a process for mounting a rotatable X-ray 
target member to a support member as described in the first part of the indepentent claim. As is known in the art, x-ray tubes have a wide 
variety of applications and constructions. In one type of 
x-ray tube, a high-energy electron beam is emitted by a 
heated-filament cathode and focused onto an x-ray emissive 
region of an anode. The x-ray emissive region comprises a 
material, such as a tungsten-rhenium alloy, which emits 
x-rays in response to the incidence of such focused electron 
beam thereon. Hence, the anode is commonly referred to as 
the x-ray target. The incidence of the high-energy electron 
beam on the x-ray target generates a large amount of heat 
in the target which is deleterious to the target structure 
and hence to the operation of the x-ray tube. Hence, in 
conventional x-ray tubes of this type, the target anode 
comprises a member, such as a disk, which is mounted on a 
supporting shaft and rotated by a motor. The disk and 
supporting shaft are typically made of a high-melting-temperature 
metal alloy, such as titanium-zirconium-molybdenum 
(TZM). The electron beam is focused onto a focal track, 
an annular portion of a surface of the disk comprising the  
 
tungsten-rhenium x-ray emissive material. The motor 
rotates the target disk at high speeds, for example 10,000 
RPM, thereby rotating portions of the focal track into and 
out of the path of the focused electron beam. The electron 
beam therefore is incident on only a portion of the x-ray 
emissive focal track at a time, allowing the remainder of 
the focal track to cool during the time taken to rotate 
such portions back into the path of the focused electron 
beam. In conventional x-ray tubes, the supporting shaft 
comprises a flanged mounting member with a threaded stem 
projecting therefrom. The stem fits through an opening 
disposed in the center of the target disk, such disk engaging 
a surface of the flanged mounted member. The TZM x-ray 
target disk is secured to the TZM supporting shaft by 
clamping the disk against the flanged mounting member with 
a TZM nut threaded onto the stem. The target disk is then 
dynamically balanced on the shaft, for example by shifting 
weights on the underside of the disk or removing small 
amounts of material from the underside of the disk. While 
the above-described securing arrangement has performed 
satisfactory in some applications, in other applications 
the target disk has been found to slip on the supporting 
sha

<CLAIMS>
A process for mounting a rotatable x-ray target member 
(24) to a support member (28) which can be rotated by a 

motor, the process comprising the steps of placing the x-ray 
target member on a mounting surface (30) of the support 

member and securing the target member to the support member 
using brazing material, characterised in that the support 

member is provided with a threaded end portion (53), the 
brazing material being disposed at an interface between 

such threaded end portion and a nut (54) adapted to receive 
such threaded end portion, the process further comprising 

the steps of fastening the nut on the threaded end portion 
and tightening the nut against the x-ray target member (24) 

to secure the x-ray target member against the mounting 
surface (30), the heating of the x-ray target member 

causing the brazing material to diffuse into the nut and 
the threaded end portion.
