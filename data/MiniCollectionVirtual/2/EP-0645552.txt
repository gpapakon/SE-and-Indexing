<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a friction material comprising 
a silicone resin, a phenolic resin, and, in certain embodiments, silicon 

nitride particles, incorporated into an aqueous paper formulation 
which is then formed into a friction material. The friction material is 

prepared by mixing the silicone resin, the phenolic resin (and, in 
certain embodiments, silicon nitride particles) into a raw paper 

formulation, forming a porous friction material, and heating the friction 
material to cure the phenolic resin and silicone resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making non-asbestos
friction materials and the friction materials produced thereby.New and advanced transmission systems and braking systems
are being developed by the automotive industry. These new systems
often involve high energy requirements. Therefore, the friction
materials technology must also be developed to meet the increasing
energy requirements of these advanced systems.The friction material must have high heat resistance in order to
be useful in the new transmission and braking systems. Not only
must the friction material remain stable at high temperatures, it must 
also be able to rapidly dissipate the high heat that is generated during
operating conditions.The high speeds generated during engagement and
disengagement of the new transmission and braking systems mean
that a friction material must be able to maintain a relatively constant
frictional engagement throughout the engagement and disengagement
of the friction material. It is important that the frictional engagement
be relatively constant over a wide range of speeds and temperatures
in order to minimize "grabbing" of materials during braking or
"shuddering" of the transmission system during power shift from one
gear to another.In particular, the new high energy friction material must be able
to withstand high speeds wherein surface speeds are up to about
71m/s (14,000 feet/minute). Also, the friction material must be able to
withstand high energy pressures up to about 4.8 MPa (700 psi). It is also
important that the friction material be useful under limited lubrication
conditions and also be able to withstand the extreme pressures and
speeds applied during use.Previously, asbestos fibers were included in friction materials.
For example, Arledter et al. US-A-3 270 846
describes phenolic and phenolic-modified resins in asbestos-filled
friction materials. Now, however, due to health and environmental
problems, asbestos is no longer being used. However, friction
materials without the presence of asbestos not only encountered
structured integrity problems during processing, but also lacked the
thermal stability which the asbestos provided. More recent friction
materials have attempted to overcome the absence of the asbestos in
the friction material by impregnating the paper or fiber materials with
phenolic or phenolic-modified and other new resins. Attempts to
overcome the limitations and drawbacks of phenolic resin impregnated
friction materials include the replacement of phenolic resins with
