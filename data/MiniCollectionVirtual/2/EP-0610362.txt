<ABSTRACT>
In order to render more difficult the copying of tickets, a laminated security ticket comprising a carrier sheet of paper material and a face sheet of direct thermal paper is disclosed in which the face sheet is sufficiently transparent to permit the carrier sheet to be seen therethrough. Such an arrangement allows the carrier sheet to be provided with a watermark and/or security pattern and/or machine-readable code which is visible through the face sheet. The face sheet itself may also be provided with a security pattern and/or machine-readable code.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated security ticket 
comprising a carrier sheet of paper material and a face sheet 
of direct thermal paper. The invention further relates to a 
system for handling security tickets. The illegal copying, or forgery, of valuable documents such as 
pre-sold tickets for events such as concerts and sports 
meetings is a growing problem which costs the organizers of 
these events an incalculable amount every year. Particularly 
with the advent of high resolution colour copying machines, 
even tickets with an intricate multi-coloured security pattern 
printed thereon are possible to reproduce very accurately. In order to reduce the demands on ground personnel at stadiums 
and arenas, it is desirable if tickets can incorporate some 
form of machine-readable code so that entrance can only be 
granted to ticket-holders whose ticket includes the 
prerequisite code. By using different codes for different 
sections of the stadium or arena, entrance to various sections 
can be effectively controlled. In order to create different 
security levels, a flexible and easily adaptable printing 
technique is needed. As well as incorporating a machine-readable 
code, it is advantageous if the ticket also displays 
a visible security pattern so that a visible check of the 
ticket is possible. One known type of security ticket is preferably of a laminate 
construction comprising a carrier sheet of card or paper and a 
sheet of face material of thermal paper. When a ticket is to be 
issued, relevant information such as the name of the event, 
date, time, seat number, etc. can be printed onto the face  
 
material simultaneously with a machine-readable code. The 
machine-readable code is normally of a bar code type which can 
be read by a scanner. Scanners are installed for example at 
entrances to arenas where the event for which the ticket is 
valid is being held. The ticket is inserted into a slot reader 
containing the scanner and, provided that the bar code 
information corresponds to information previously entered 
into the memory of the computer to which the scanner is 
connected, the holder of the ticket is admitted to the arena. Such tickets are, however, relatively easy to copy since the 
bar code can be photocopied. Thus, the potential purchaser of 
such a ticket has no means of assuring that the ticket is in 
fact genuine and not a forgery. A multilayer identification card is known from US-A-4 579 754 
in which information in the form of patterns, letters, numbers 
and/or

<CLAIMS>
A laminated security ticket comprising a carrier sheet 
of paper material and a face sheet of direct thermal paper, 


characterized in
 that said face sheet is 
sufficiently transparent to permit the carrier sheet to be seen 

therethrough. 
A laminated security ticket according to claim 1, 

characterized in
 that said carrier sheet is 
provided with a watermark. 
A laminated security ticket according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that said carrier sheet is 
preprinted with a security pattern or machine-readable code on 

its side to which the face sheet is to be laminated before 
lamination of the face sheet takes place. 
A laminated security ticket according to any of claims 
1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that a security 
pattern or machine-readable code is printed on said face sheet. 
A laminated security ticket according to claim 3 or 4, 

characterized in
 that said security pattern is 
a Guilloche pattern. 
A laminated security ticket according to any of claims 
1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that said face sheet 
is a sheet of infrared readable thermal paper. 
A laminated security ticket according to claim 6, 

characterized in
 that said face sheet is 
provided with a blackened window in which an IR-readable code 

is thermally printed.  
 
A laminated security ticket according to claim 3, 4 or 
7, 
characterized in
 that said machine-readable 
code is a non-standard bar code. 
A laminated security ticket according to any of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that said 
carrier sheet is provided with a watermark in the form of a bar 

code which can be read through the face sheet. 
A system for handling security tickets comprising a 
supply of carrier sheets, a supply of transparent or semi-transparent 

face sheets, means for laminating the face sheets 
to the carrier sheets, hardware for thermal printing 

information on said face sheets, software to allow variation of 
the information printed on said face sheets and a programmable 

scanner means for reading at least some of the information on 
the thus formed ticket. 
A system for handling security tickets according to 
claim 10, 
characterized in
 that the software is 
adapted to generate non-standard bar codes. 
A system for handling security tickets according to 
claim 10 or 11, 
characterized in
 that the 
transparent or semi-transparent face sheets are sheets of 

infrared readable thermal paper.
