<ABSTRACT>
Method of controlling power of an access packet (PA) sent by a mobile (MS) towards a base transmitting/receiving station (BTS) within a radio communication system (1), this base transmitting/receiving station (BTS) regularly sending a broadcasting channel (BCCH). Within the base transmitting/receiving station (BTS), power information is included in the broadcasting channel (BCCH), which information is representative of the transmission power (TPo(BTS)) on this channel. Within the mobile (MS), a measurement is taken of the power received on this channel, this power measurement (RP(MS)) is compared with the transmission power obtained from the transmitted power information included in the broadcasting channel (BCCH), in order to deduce therefrom an estimate of the propagation loss from the mobile (MS) to the base transmitting/receiving station (BTS), and an optimal transmission power for the access packet (PA) is determined on the basis of the estimated propagation loss and of parameters of the system (1). Use in radio telephony, especially for GSM and TETRA systems.

Method of controlling the power at which an access

channel to a base transceiver station (BTS) of a mobile radio
system, said base transceiver station (BTS) transmitting a

broadcast control channel (BCCH) regularly, characterised in

at the base transceiver station (BTS) the broadcast
control channel (BCCH) transmits a power indication

representing the transmit power of said channel;
at the mobile (MS) the power received on said channel
is measured, the measured power (RP(MS)) is compared

with the transmit power indicated by the transmit
power indication on the broadcast control channel

(BCCH) to deduce an estimated propagation loss from
the mobile (MS) to the base transceiver station (BTS),

and an optimal transmit power (TPo(MS)), for the access

estimated propagation loss and parameters of the
mobile radio system.
Method according to claim 1 characterised in that

Method according to claim 3 characterised in that
the optimal transmit power (TPo(MS)) for the access packet

TPo(MS)=TP(BTS)-RP(MS)+Ro(BTS)+X

TP(BTS) is the power at which the broadcast control 
channel (BCCH) is transmitted by the base transceiver

station (BTS),

Method according to claim 4 characterised in that
the optimal power ((TPo(MS)) for transmission of the access

TPo(BTS) is a corrected transmit power equal to the
transmit power TP(BTS) of the broadcast control

channel (BCCH) increased by a base component (x) of

Ro(BTS) is the required receive power at the base
transceiver station (BTS), and

Method according to claim 7 characterised in that
before a mobile (MS) in the access phase transmits an access

packet (PA) to the base transceiver station (BTS) on an access
channel (RACH) the optimal power (TPo(MS)) for transmission of

said access packet (PA) is calculated from the corrected
transmit power indication TPo(BTS) received on the broadcast

control channel (BCCH) , from the measured power RP(MS)
received on said broadcast control channel (BCCH) by the

mobile (MS), and from an internal required receive power
indication (R'o(BTS)) representing the predefined required

receive power Ro(BTS) increased by the second margin component
