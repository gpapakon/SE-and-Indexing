<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acaricide, 
and more specifically to a propiolate ester compound 
suitably used for controlling house dust mites. Phenyl salicylate has been known as an active 
ingredient of an acaricide for controlling acarines such 
as house dust mites. However, the controlling effect of 
said compound is not always satisfactory and more 
effective compounds are desired. Novel propiolate 
ester compounds have been found possessing 
potent acaricidal activities. The present invention 
provides a propiolate ester compound represented by the 
formula I: 
wherein R₁ represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a  
 
C₁-C₄ alkyl group or a C₁-C₄ alkoxy group;
 
m is an integer of from 1 to 5;
 
Y represents -CH₂CH₂CH₂-, -OCH₂- or -CH₂O-;
 
Z represents a C₂-C₆ alkylene group which may be 
substituted with a C₁-C₄ alkyl group; and
 
R₁ may be the same or different, when m is an integer 
larger than 1. An acaricidal composition containing the 
compound as an active ingredient is also provided and a 
method for controlling acarines by applying the 
composition. The compound of the present invention (which 
will be hereinafter referred to as "present compound") 
shows an excellent quick action and residual effect, and 
it has a good fumigating effect without an offensive 
smell. The present compound is particularly good in 
controlling house dust mites. Examples of the C₁-C₄ alkyl group for R₁ of the 
formula I include a methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl 
group, isopropyl group, n-butyl group, isobutyl group, 
sec-butyl group and t-butyl group, and examples of C₁-C₄ 
alkoxy group for R₁ include methoxy group, ethoxy group, 
n-propyloxy group, isopropyloxy group, n-butyloxy group, 
isobutyloxy group, sec-butyloxy group and tert-butyloxy 
group. The present compound may be produced according 
to one of the following methods.  A method for producing the present compound, 
which comprises reacting an alcohol compound represented 
by the formula II: 
wherein R₁, Y, Z, and m represent those specified above, 
with propiolic acid chloride in the presence of a base. The reaction is usually carried out in a 
solvent, which includes ethers such as diethyl ether, 
tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, aromatic hydrocarbons such 
as toluene, benzene, xylene and chlorobenzene, aliphatic 
or alicyclic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane or 
cyclohexane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylenechloride, 
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane, 
esters such as ethyl acetate and methyl 
acetat
