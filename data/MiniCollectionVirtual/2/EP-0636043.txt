Container (1, 1', 28) with a pressure vessel for the regeneration and storage of tennis 
balls (21,21') under excess gas pressure, preferably excess air pressure, with a bottom 

(3, 20, 35) and an easily opened and closed pressure-tight cover (3', 4, 31, 31'), 
with a pressure relief valve (7, 7') as well as an outlet valve (6, 6') which are connected 

with the pressure vessel (2, 2') of the container (1, 1', 28), with an inlet valve 
(24, 24'), as well as with a gas pump (8, 8', 34) attachable to it, characterized in that
 
in that the gas pump (8, 8', 34) is arranged in a structurally integrated manner inside 

the pressure vessel (2, 30, 30') or the container (1, 1', 28) and inside the pressure 
vessel (2), there is a removable receptacle (12) which consists of several mutually 

detachable parts (13, 14) and inside of this receptacle, there are recesses (15, 16) of 
the size of tennis balls (21, 21') for holding the balls separately from each other and 

said recesses (15, 16) are separate but they communicate with one another with 
respect to the gas via channels (32) or the closing gap of the parts (13, 14) of the 

receptacle, and this objective is achieved in that the recesses communicate with 
respect to the gas via channels (32) or the closing gap of the parts (13, 14) of the 

receptacle as well as via the inlet valve (24, 24') and they extend over the parts (13, 
14) of the receptacle (12) which, taken together, comprise all of the recesses (15, 

16), and the excess pressure of the gas can be applied via the recesses (15, 16) to the 
tennis balls (21, 21') by means of the gas pump (8, 8'). 
Container according to Claim 1 characterized in that
 
the pressure vessel (29) consists of at least two chambers (30, 30'), which communicate 

with respect to the gas via a connecting channel (32), and the gas pump (34) is 
arranged inside the container (28) between the chambers (30, 30').  

 
Container according to Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that
 
the pressure vessel (2) and the receptacle (12) have cylindrical shapes, which, in the 

longitudinal direction, exhibit a segmental flattening (17), inside of which the gas 
pump (8) is integrated into the pressure vessel (2), which is open towards the bottom 

and can be closed by means of a pressure-tight cover (4), for which purpose the 
pressure vessel (2) and the cover (4) preferably have threads (25). 
Container according to Claim 1 characterized in that
 
the gas pump (8) consists of a piston (9) with a cylinder (26), which passes through 

the bottom (20) of the pressure vessel (2) in a gas-tight manner and terminates in the 
upper cover (3), and the piston (9) of the gas pump (8) has a handle (10) which is 

arranged so as to swivel around the piston axis and which can be lowered into a 
recess (11) withi
n the upper cover (3). 
Container according to Claim 4 characterized in that
 
the handle (10) is arranged in such a way that, when folded out of the recess (11), it 

can be swiveled by 90 degrees and has a detachable engaging device. 
Container according to Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that
 
the gas pump (8, 8') can be operated electrically and is arranged inside the upper 

cover (3') of the container (1'). 
Container according to one of the preceding claims characterized in that
 
a pressure gauge (5, 5') and a pressure regulator (22) are integrated into the upper 

cover (3, 3') of the container, and they are connected with the pressure vessel (2, 2') 
of the container in order to maintain a constant specified pressure.  

 
Container according to Claim 1 characterized in that
 
the receptacle (12) is formed of two parts (13, 13', 14, 14') that can be detached 

from one another and the receptacle (12) consists of non-compressible, preferably 
closed-cell plastic foam. 
Container according to Claim 1 or 8 characterized in that
 
the receptacle consists of several layers (13', 14') which can be stacked one above 

the other, whereby each layer consists of at least two mutually detachable parts. 
Container according to one of the preceding claims characterized in that
 
attachment devices equipped with shut-off valves are arranged on the container or 

on the pressure vessel for the attachment of further mobile pressure chambers. 
Container according to Claim 2 characterized in that
 
the pressure vessel consists of a block with three bores, whereby two bores are 

designed as interconnected pressure chambers and the gas pump is integrated into 
the third bore. 
Container according to Claim 1 characterized in that
 
the pressure relief valve (7,7') and the outlet valve (6, 6') are structurally combined 

into a single valve.
