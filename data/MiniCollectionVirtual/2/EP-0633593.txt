<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron 
beam source and an electron beam application apparatus, 
and particularly relates to an ultra-monochromatic 
electron beam source suitable for making the resolution 
of an electron microscope high and suitable for an 
analyzer for performing material evaluation based on 
energy analysis, and an electron beam application 
apparatus and an electronic apparatus using such an 
ultra-monochromatic electron beam source. A field emission electron gun is widely used 
as a conventional electron beam source of small energy 
dispersion. For example, the operating theory of the 
field emission electron gun is described in "Electron-Ion 
Beam Handbook 2nd Edition", pp. 145-151, edited by 
a 132th committee of the Japan Society for the Promotion 
of Science (Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun Ltd., 1986). In 
this electron beam source, a tip of a tungsten (W) 
cathode is sharpened into a diameter of about 100 nm so 
that electric field is concentrated into the tip, and 
field emission electrons emitted from the tip into a 
vacuum are used. On the other hand, in order to obtain an 
electron beam of small energy dispersion in apparatus 
such as an analyzer using a monochromatic electron  
 
beam, a very small part of an electron beam emitted 
from a conventional electron beam source is extracted 
by means of a slit or the like after the electron beam 
is passed through an energy analyzer to disperse energy 
on the basis of magnetic field or electric field. A concept that a cathode which comprises a 
multi-layer structure of Semiconductor/Insulator/ 
Semiconductor (SIS) being substituted for a conventional 
cathode which comprises Metal/Insulator/Metal structure 
(MIM) is disclosed in Takeuchi et al. entitled 
"Physics and Applications of a Tunneling Effect 
(Baifukan LTD.,), Chapter 6, pages 88-90, December, 
(1987). This document however fails to show any concrete 
structure thereof and a method for applying a 
voltage thereto. A voltage is applied between a substrate 
and an upper electrode of the MIM structure to 
draw out electrons in the substrate to the electrode by 
the tunneling effect. The potential between the substrate 
and the electrode becomes larger than a work 
function thereof, then the emitted electrons are easily 
emitted into a vacuum therefrom. JP-A-5-74333 discloses a structure to obtain 
an electron beam on the basis of a resonant tunnelling 
effect using a quantum well layer. In the structure disclosed in JP-A 5-74333, 
sufficient transparency cannot be obtained,
