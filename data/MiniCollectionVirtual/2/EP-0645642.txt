<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aircraft landing systems and more
especially it relates to scanning beam MLS (Microwave Landing
Systems).As is well known to those skilled in the art, MLS systems
comprise two ground based beam scanning equipments one of
which scans in elevation and the other of which scans in azimuth,
aircraft guidance information being derived by an airborne
receiver responsive to the scanned beams. One of the problems
associated with MLS is that the beams from which the airborne
receiver derives guidance can be affected by a combination of
MLS ground equipment errors and multipath effects dependent on
the local terrain.This problem stems from the fact that MLS scanning beam
antennas produce a main beam and associated sidelobes. The
scanning beam sidelobes are distributed throughout the space in
front of the MLS ground based equipment and illuminate any
multipath reflectors. The multipath reflectors in the case of the
azimuth ground equipment, can be buildings or elevated terrain
(hills) etc., and may, or may not, be present at a particular
aerodrome runway location. The multipath reflector in the case of
the elevation equipment, is the ground and is therefore always
present at any location. The MLS regulatory authorities (ICAO, Eurocae, FAA, CAA)
specify a maximum limit on guidance error caused by the effect of
sidelobes reflected into the scanning beam by multipath reflectors. They
also specify that the MLS ground based equipment shall shut itself down
if the maximum specified guidance error due to the effect of sidelobes
and multipath is exceeded. The MLS ground based equipment for
elevation or for azimuth comprises a phased array which is necessary to
achieve the high scan rate required. Each element of the phased array
must contain as a minimum, an electronic phase shifter. Failures of
individual array phase shifters cause the MLS array antenna sidelobes to
degrade and hence increase the effect of the sidelobes on guidance via
any multipath reflector.It is therefore necessary to monitor in MLS ground based
equipment, the effects of sidelobes due to phase shifter module failure
via the multipath on guidance, and shutdown the MLS ground equipment
when guidance due to this effect is out of allowed tolerance. One such
known MLS system is disclosed in European Patent Serial Number
EP 0343295. This known system is arranged to monitor various
parameters of the transmitted radar beam such as scanning beam mean
angle error, effective radiated power and timing error and to shut down
the station if
