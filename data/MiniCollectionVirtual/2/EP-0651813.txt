<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an isolated promoter element that exhibits root abundant expression in (Brassica) sp. The promoter element has particular utility in driving the transcription of heterologous structural proteins that confer disease immunity or resistance to disease susceptible roots. The word "disease" encompasses any adverse condition caused to a plant by an organism other than itself, such as fungi, bacteria, and insects. Plasmids incorporating the promoter are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an isolated 
promoter for root abundant gene expression. More 
particularly, the present invention is also directed 
to a composite gene comprising the isolated promoter 
in combination with a heterologous structural gene, 
preferably a heterologous gene encoding a protein or 
peptide that when expressed in the roots of a plant 
confers immunity or resistance to disease to the 
roots of the plant. The present invention is useful 
because it provides a promoter and a method for 
genetically conferring immunity or resistance to 
disease to the roots of transformable plants. In canola as well as other crops, various fungal 
and insect diseases exist that are manifested in the 
roots of the plant. Although the plant's roots are 
underground, conventional methods of treatment to 
prevent or control root diseases come from above 
ground. These conventional treatments include the 
application of a variety of chemicals via sprays, 
granules and the like. These conventional 
treatments are both labor intensive and costly. 
Often, the exposed edible portion of the crop plant 
receives application of the chemical agent that is 
intended for localization at the roots. On 
occasion, the conventional treatments require that 
the applied chemical agent be worked into the 
ground. However, care must be exercised to avoid 
damaging the plant's roots. Because conventional 
treatments are applied from above ground, excess 
quantities of the chemical agent must be applied to 
maintain an effective concentration at the portion 
of the root zone furthest from the application 
point. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a means for generally or specifically  
 
conferring immunity or resistance to fungal or 
insect diseases on a plant whose roots are 
susceptible to such a disease. It is a further object of the present invention 
to provide the components and a method for 
conferring disease resistance on the roots of food 
crops that eliminates conventional treatments and 
that exhibits minimal or no manifestation in the 
edible fruit or leafy portions of the plant. The process of tissue and organ development in 
plants involves the temporal and spatial expression 
of a large array of genes that determine the 
patterns of cell division, elongation and 
differentiation leading to the final structure and 
function of the tissue or organ. For example, 
Kamalay and Goldberg (Cell 19:935, 1980; Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA, 81:2801, 1984) estimated that as 
many as 25,000
