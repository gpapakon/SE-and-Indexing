Two-stage, torsionally flexible shaft coupling in 
particular for boat drives, substantially comprising a 

coupling flange (10), which is to be disposed at the 
drive end, and a hub (12) which is to be disposed at the 

output end and engages axially into a central recess (13) 
of the coupling flange (10), a secondary power 

transmission element (20) which is connected non-rotatably 
to the hub (12) and has claws (19) engaging 

paraxially into peripherally extending longitudinal 
recesses (18) of the coupling flange (10
), and having two 
groups of elastic coupling elements (16; 17), of which 

the first group comprising at least one elastic element 
(16) is disposed between the coupling flange (10) and the 

hub (12) and the second group is associated with the 
longitudinal recesses (18) in the coupling flange (10), 

with which longitudinal recesses the claws (19) are 
associated so as to be peripherally movable in peripheral 

direction, the first group of elastic coupling elements 
(16) being tuned so as to be torsionally less rigid than 

the second group and the power transmission at low torque 
and no load or low partial load being transmitted from 

the coupling flange (10) exclusively via the first group 
of elastic coupling elements (16) to the hub (12) and the 

second group of torsionally stiffer elastic coupling 
elements (17) being automatically introduced into the 

power transmission only in the event of higher partial 
load to full load with higher torque, 
characterized by
 
construction of the first elastic coupling stage in the 

manner of a known rubber roller coupling having rod-shaped, 
rubber-elastic coupling elements (16) supported 

between the hub (12) and an outer polygon (14), further 
characterized in that the wall portions of the coupling 

flange (10), which towards the centre delimit the 
longitudinal recesses (18) for engagement of the claws 

(19), simultaneously form the outer polygon (15) and that  
 

the elastic coupling elements (16; 17) of both groups are 
disposed concentrically relative to one another 

substantially without any axial offset. 
Coupling according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the 
central recess (13) of the coupling flange (10) and the 

hub (12) in each case have a polygonal contour, hub (12) 
and coupling flange recess (13) engage one into the other 

with their contours peripherally offset and the elastic 
coupling elements (16) of the first group are inserted, 

preferably under radial initial tension, into the gaps 
between hub (12) and coupling flange recess (13) which 

are created by the peripheral offset. 
Coupling according to claim 1 or the following claim, 
characterized in that the contours of hub (12) and 

coupling flange recess (13) are defined by regular, foursided 
polygons. 
Coupling according to claim 1 or one of the following, 
characterized in that the coupling flange recess (13), on 

the one hand, and the longitudinal recesses (18), on the 
other hand, are in each case circumscribed or delimited 

by - relatively thin - wall portions (35), in each case 
one polygon angle (36) being disposed in radial alignment 

with a wall portion (35) which separates two longitudinal 
recesses (18) of the coupling flange (10). 
Coupling according to claim 1 or one of the following, 
that the secondary power transmission element (20) having 

the claws (19) which engage into the longitudinal 
recesses (18) of the coupling flange (10) takes the form 

of a substantially flat disk and is non-rotatably 
connected directly to the hub (12). 
Coupling according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
secondary power transmission element (20) has a central  

 
location recess (21), which substantially has the 

polygonal contour of the hub (12), and is connected to 
the hub (12) by caulking or riveting. 
Coupling according to claim 1 or one of the following, 
characterized in that the elastic coupling elements (17) 

of the second group take the form of sleeves, which are 
mounted onto claws (19) of the secondary power 

transmission element (20), which is connected to the hub 
(12), and cooperate with the transverse edges of the 

longitudinal recesses (18). 
Coupling according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
elastic elements (17; 22) of the second group take the 

form of cushion-like shaped parts and are inserted and 
held in pocket-like receivers (37) in the region of both 

transverse edges of the longitudinal recesses (18). 
Coupling according to claim 8, characterized in that in 
the unloaded state of the coupling the claws (19) occupy 

their position of rest in each case roughly midway 
between the elastic elements (17, 17; 17, 22).

coupling elements (17) of the second group, which are 

directed in driving direction of rotation (U), take the
