<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head slider includes a track portion 
which is constituted by a flat surface (5) to be opposed to 

a recording medium and two track side surfaces (12) each 
having a concave conical peripheral shape and defining 

the width of the track as viewed on the above flat 
surface. A process is also disclosed for producing such 

a magnetic head slider by using a grinding stone having 
a conical or frusto-conical shape 

at a peripheral side and rotated, so that the track side 
surfaces each having a conical or frusto-conical 

peripheral shape and defining the width of the track as 
viewed on the above flat surface are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic head 
sliders to be used for recording information on 
recording media and reading out it from the recording 
media. The present invention also relates to a process 
for producing such magnetic head sliders. Heretofore, magnetic head sliders have been used 
to record information on recording media such as hard 
discs and to read out information from such recording 
media. Fig. 5 illustrates the construction of an 
example of the conventional monolithic magnetic head 
sliders of a center rail type. In Fig. 5, a magnetic 
head slider 51 includes air bearing surfaces (ABS) 53-1 
and 53-2 provided on opposite side portions of a slider 
body 52, and a center rail 56 in a central portion of 
the slider body 52. The center rail 56 is constituted 
by a yoke portion 54 around which a coil is to be 
wounded, and a track 55 involving a magnetic gap having 
a given width and a given depth. Leading ramps 57-1 and  
 
57-2 are provided in the form of inclined surfaces at 
end portions of the air bearing surfaces 53-1 and 53-2, 
respectively, on a side from which air is introduced. 
On the other hand, a trailing ramp 58 is provided in the 
form of an inclined surface at an end of the center rail 
56 on an air outlet side. In order to produce the conventional magnetic 
head slider 51 having the above construction, a yoke 
portion 50 is bonded to a slider body 52 made of a 
magnetic material such as ferrite. Then, the slider 
body 52 and the yoke portion 50 are roughly machined to 
form the air bearing surfaces 53-1 and 53-2, and the 
center rail 56 is formed as shown in Fig. 5 by a dotted 
line. After the above rough machining, beveled portions 
59-1 through 59-4 are formed by beveling edges of the 
air bearing surfaces 53-1 and 53-2, and to finally 
define the air bearing surfaces (ABS) through fine 
grinding. On the other hand, the width of the track is 
determined by beveling (fine grinding) edge portions of 
the center rail 56. Thereby, the magnetic head slider 
51 having a given final shape with a given track width 
"d" is obtained. Since the information is recorded or read out by 
means of the track 55 in the magnetic head slider 51, it 
is necessary, in the production of the magnetic head  
 
slider, to work, with a high accuracy, the depth "d" of 
the track 55 and the depth of the track from a plane 
surface of the track at which the track is opposed to 
the recording medium. For this purpose, according to 
the conventional magnetic head sliders 51, the slider 
body 52

A magnetic head slider comprising a track 
portion, said track portion being constituted by a flat 

surface to be opposed to a recording medium and two 
track side surfaces each having a convex conical 

peripheral shape and defining the width of the track 
portion as viewed on the above flat surface. 
The magnetic head slider set forth in Claim 1, 
wherein said two track side surfaces are symmetrical 

with respect to a plane vertically passing a center line 
of a center rail of the magnetic head slider. 
The magnetic head slider set forth in Claim 1 or 2 
wherein a line drawn on the conical peripheral surface 

of each of the track side face of the track portion and 
passing a vertex of a conical shape constituting the 

conical peripheral surface forms an angle of 30째-80째 
between a center line of the conical shape. 
A process for producing a magnetic head slider, 
comprising step of forming each of two track side surfaces by 

descending, relative to a track portion of a core 
portion of the magnetic head slider, a grinding stone

shape at a peripheral side while being rotated, said 

track side surfaces each having a conical peripheral 
shape and defining the width of the track as viewed on 

the above flat surface. 
The producing process set forth in Claim 4, 
wherein the grinding stone is used, which has a conical 

peripheral surface corresponding to that of each of the 
track side faces of the track, and the conical 

peripheral surface of the grinding stone forms an angle 
of 30째-80째 between a center line of the conical shape. 
A magnetic head slider comprising: 

(1) a slider body; and 
(2) a yoke portion provided at one end of said 
slider body, wherein projections are provided on 

opposite sides of the slider body, respectively, an air-floating 
surface is formed on an upper portion of each 

of said projections, a central rail is provided in a 
central portion of an upper face of the slider body and 

an upper face of the yoke portion, a magnetic gap is 
formed between the slider body and yoke portion, a track 

portion is provided on the upper face of the central 
rail, and said track portion is constituted by by a flat 

surface to be opposed to a recording medium and two 
track side surfaces each having a convex conical 

peripheral shape and defining the width of the track 
portion as viewed on the above flat surface.

said process comprising: 


(1) bonding a yoke portion-forming part to a slider body 
part; 
(2) forming air bearing surface portions on opposite 
sides of upper faces of the thus bonded slider body part 

and yoke portion part; 
(3) forming each of two track side surfaces by means of a
