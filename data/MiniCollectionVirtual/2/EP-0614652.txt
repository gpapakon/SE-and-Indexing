<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a convenient and secure hemostasis 
of arteries at the puncture area after removal of an 

injection needle, etc. used for therapies or tests involving 
arterio puncture, or a convenient and secure hemostasis of veins 

after removal of an injection needle, etc. inserted into a vein 
for blood extraction, drop of water, blood transfusion, 

artificial dialysis, etc. 
On one surface of a stretchable base material (1) having a 
strong recovery action, an adhesive layer (2) is formed, and a 

pad (3) is placed thereon. This pad has a thickness of about 8 
to 20 mm and such a size that it presses both the puncture of 

the arterial blood vessel and the puncture of the skin surface, 
with an elasticity and a compression strength capable of pressing 

the arterial blood vessel. 
The pad is put on the puncture area and the base material 
is stuck to the skin while stretching the base material whereby 

the pad is pressed tightly against the puncture by the shrinking 
base material. The puncture of the artery is thereby pressed and 

is closed for hemostasis. Further, the blood leaking out of the 
puncture of the skin surface is absorbed in the pad. After the 

hemostasis is completed, the pad is peeled off and removed. 
A pressing plate (21) larger in size than the pad may be 
interposed between the base material and the pad, to press the 

pad more strongly against the puncture area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sticking material for
hemostasis, i.e. a hemostatic adhesive bandage or plaster.EP-A-0 067 622 describes a surgical plaster having a
stretchable strip carrying a pad, the pad being sufficiently
incompressible to insure that the pad will completely flatten
and close a vein against escape of blood after a puncture of the
vein or blood sampling. The pad is not compressible more than 25
% of its height by the elastic strip, and has a substantially
non absorbing surface. While this surgical plaster is suitable
to flatten a vein, it is not satisfactory to provide hemostasis
after an arteric puncture.EP-A-O 141 693 describes a compressing hemostatic plaster comprising a body
of such form, dimension and rigidity as to exert a compressive action on the
point or region of hemorrhage while allowing free blood circulation, the body
serving as support for a pad of a non-adherent hemostatic and/or cicatrising
material in form of a powder, gel or tablet. The body (2) is fixed to or
incorporated in a band (1) which itself may be chosen from woven or unwoven
textile materials and may optionally be provided with an adhesive for application
to the skin. While this plaster may be suitable to provide hemostasis of a vein, it
is not satisfactory to provide hemostasis after an arteric puncture. In recent years, therapies and tests involving arteric
puncture such as arterio puncture catheter, arteriographs or
inter arterial injection, have been widely conducted. The arteric
puncture catheter is widely used for the purpose of
monitoring the blood pressure of artery during operation, and
collecting the blood from the artery to check the conditions of
the lungs by the blood conditions. The arterio puncture catheter
is also applied to hemodialysis or the like. Further, the
arteriography is widely used not only for diagnosis, but also
for the procedure of arterial embolism and percutaneous trans-catheter
angioplasty.Heretofore, when the therapies and tests involving arterio
puncture are conducted, in many cases, after the therapy or the
like, the injection needle, catheter, therapeutic tube or the
like is removed from the ductus arteriosus, and the area from
which it is removed (the puncture area) is pressed with fingers
for at least about 10 minutes. Then, a gauze is placed over the puncture area and a large
pillow-like pad is put thereon, and then fastened to apply
pressure to the ductus arteriosus for hemostasis. After the
hemostasis is ascertained, the patient is returned to a ward or
the

A sticking compressing material for hemostasis comprising an elastically stretchable and
long strip-shaped base material (1) having a recovering property with an adhesive layer (2)

disposed on one surface thereof and carrying a pad (3) of suitable form, dimension and
rigidity for exerting a compressing action when applied to the point or region of hemorrhage,

so as to ensure complete flattening and closing of a vein when applied against a puncture area
of said vein, 
characterised in that
 for hemostasis of a blood vessel being a vein or artery, the
body is a pressing plate (21) of larger size than the pad (3) and is interposed between the pad

(3) and the adhesive layer (2) on the base material (1) and that the pad (3) has a multi-layer-structure

comprising, on said base material (1) in a sequence, a cushion layer (4) having a
high pressing effect in a thickness direction, a lower layer (5) which absorbs blood and has a

pressing effect, an upper layer (6) which rapidly absorbs blood, and a surface layer (7) which
prevents hairiness of the upper layer (6) and deposition of coagulated blood.
A sticking compressing material for hemostasis according to claim 1 wherein the pad (3)
has an elliptical shape having a long side of from 20 to 40 mm, a short side of from 10 to 20
