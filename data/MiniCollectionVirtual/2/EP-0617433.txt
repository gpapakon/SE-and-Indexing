<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
composite electrical insulator wherein a metal fitting
is fixedly secured to one end of a plastic rod which is
covered by an insulating sheath.A composite electrical insulator with such a
constitution is known, e.g., from U.S. Patent
No. 4,654,478, wherein a fiber-reinforced plastic rod is
covered by a sheath comprising a resilient and
electrically insulating material, such as silicone
rubber, ethylenepropylene rubber and the like, and one
end portion of the plastic rod as covered by the sheath
is inserted into the bore in a sleeve portion of the
metal fitting and the metal fitting is then fixedly
secured to the plastic rod. Such a composite insulator
makes use of advantages of various materials, e.g., an
improved resistance to tensile force and an excellent
weight to strength ratio of the fiber reinforced plastic
material, and the distinguished weatherability and antitracking
characteristics of silicone rubber, 
ethylenepropylene rubber or the like.To manufacture such composite insulators, the
sleeve portion of the metal fitting is usually
compressed radially inwardly onto the plastic rod so as
to firmly clamp the rod. That is to say, by compressing
the sleeve portion radially inwardly, the end portion of
the plastic rod situated opposite to the metal fitting
is uniformly and tightly clamped to integrally connect
the metal fitting with the plastic rod and prevent
withdrawal of the plastic rod from the fitting even
under a large tensile force, while maintaining a watertight
state of the annular space between the outer
surface of the sheath and the inner surface of the
sleeve portion of the metal fitting.Typically, the metal fitting is subjected to a
dip-plating so that the outer surface of the metal
fitting is more or less uneven. In this instance,
an insufficient clamping force tends to form a gap
between the metal fitting and the sheath, often making
it difficult to preserve the required tightness.
A deteriorated tightness results in intrusion of water
from outside into the space between the metal fitting
and the sheath, and hence in a difficulty to maintain
the required electrical insulating property, possibly
giving rise to an internal destruction due to flashover.While a required tightness may be realized by 
an increased clamping force, the resilient material
forming the sheath would then be maintained in an
excessively compressed state and thus undergo a gradual
deterioration in the restoring characteristic so that it
would be impossible to achieve the
