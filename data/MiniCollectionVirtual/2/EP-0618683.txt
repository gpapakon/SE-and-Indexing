<ABSTRACT>
A changeover means provides for contactless interchange of power between an r.f. 
source such as a transmitter Tx‚ÇÅ and two loads, such as an aerial 2 and a test load 3. 

It can be used in a changeover system for exchanging main and standby transmitters in 
the event of failure of the main transmitter between the aerial and a test load, or for 

connecting transmitters in parallel in such a way as to leave them well matched in the 
event of failure of one while permitting half power operation from the surviving 

transmitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a changeover means for an r.f. source, particularly but not
exclusively for use with an r.f. transmitter.It is normal practice for radio and television transmitting stations to provide a standby
transmitter as well as a main transmitter for each frequency on which transmission takes
place. In the event of the main transmitter failing, it is switched off, disconnected from
the aerial, and the standby transmitter is then connected to the aerial and then switched
on. The main transmitter would then normally be connected to a test load and powered
on to enable the fault to be located. It would be desirable to be able to exchange the
main transmitter and the standby transmitter between the aerial and a test load in the
event of a problem developing on the main transmitter, to ensure no loss of transmission,
but the high powers of transmitters would cause arcing at switch contacts, and so in
practice both transmitters are switched off at the changeover, necessitating an
interruption of transmission. Also, transmitters could be damaged if working into
mismatched loads and, for this reason, normally have in-built protection circuits to
switch themselves off. It is also known, e.g. from FR-A-1 079 069, US-A-2 534 624 or CH-A-427 934,
to connect two transmitters in parallel to an
aerial, so that transmission is maintained if one transmitter fails. However, the output
drops to one quarter power in such a case, and the functioning transmitter has to be
disconnected and reconnected on its own to the aerial to enable its power output to be
fully utilised, again resulting in a loss of transmission. The Applicants have invented a changeover means
as defined in the appended Claims
which can be used to avoid this
disadvantage, while also having more general use. The changeover means is based on
the coupling between resonant circuits.Referring to Figure 1, in a circuit with an LC parallel resonant circuit connected in
parallel with an input and another connected in parallel with an output, there would
normally be no coupling between the input and the output, so that an AC source
connected to the input would not be coupled to the output. However, there are two ways
of achieving coupling between two such resonant circuits, namely, inductively and
capacitively. Inductive coupling could be accomplished by mutual inductance of the
inductors by arranging them in sufficiently close proximity, or by the use of a common
inductor (Figure 2) and capacitive coupling can be accomplished by a capacitor
connecte
