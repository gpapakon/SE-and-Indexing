<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to structural adhesives 
based on an acrylic reactant. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
double-component structural adhesives (bonding agents) based 
on an acrylic reactant. In the art, structural adhesives based on acrylic 
reactants are already known. They are disclosed, e.g., in 
U.S. patents 3,591,438; 3,594,451; 3,642,750; 3,203,941 and 
3,890,407. In particular in U.S. patent 3,890,407; adhesive 
compositions are disclosed in which the critical components 
and essentially constituted by chlorosulfonated polyethylene 
or a mixture of sulfonyl chloride with chlorinated 
polyethylene, a vinylic monomer and a polymerization 
catalyst constituted by a free-radical generator, a 
polymerization initiator, an adhesion promoter and an 
adhesive-activator component. Among vinylic monomers, also polyol (meth)acrylic esters 
are included, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate or 
dimethacrylate, the function of which is of crosslinking the 
adhesive during the curing step. The present Applicant has found now a novel class of 
double-component acrylic adhesives in which crosslinkers are 
used which are perfectly compatible with the components 
which constitute the same adhesives, which were never  
 
described in the past literature, with regard to this 
function. Therefore, the object of the present invention are the 
double-component structural adhesives based on an acrylic 
reactant, which comprise: 
(a) a first adhesive component constituted by a solution of 
a chlorosulfonated polymer in a mono-functional acrylic 
monomer containing a free-radical generator agent, a 
stabilizer agent, an adhesion promoter and a crosslinker 
selected from among silicon derivatives falling within 
the scope of the following general formulae: 
 
wherein: 
R₁represents an alkyl radical of from 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms, R₂represents an alkyl radical of from 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms or a phenyl radical, Yrepresents an oxygen bridge, an amino group or an 
alkylene radical of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, nis an integer comprised within the range of from 1 to  
 
50; (b) a second component, which activates the adhesive 
component, constituted by a mixture of aldehyde-amine 
condensation products, in which an organic salt of a 
metal belonging to the first transition series, in a low 
oxidation state, is dissolved. Preferred products according to the present invention 
falling within the scope of general formulae (I) and (II) 
are: 
1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane; 
1,3-divinyl-1,3-diphenyl-1,3-
