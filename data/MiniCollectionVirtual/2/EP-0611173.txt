<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing juice for wine-making, including a first stage of harvesting the bunches of grapes with the aid of one or more self-propelled grape-harvesting machines, a stage of collecting the grapes in a mobile trailer, the capacity of which corresponds to the capacity of several grape-harvesting machines, a stage of transportation between the grape-harvesting location and the winemaking site, a stage of pressing in order to extract the juices and a stage of placing in a fermentation vessel (vat). Pressing takes place at least partially during the stage of transportation of the grapes between the vineyard and the winemaking site, by means of a vehicle including a part (8) for storing the grapes and a part (9) for receiving the pressed juice, the said parts (8, 9) being separated by a grid (7), the process also consisting in directly pouring out the pressed juice obtained during the stage of transportation into a fermentation vessel. The invention also relates to a vehicle for carrying out the said process.

Process for the preparation of juice for wine-making
including a first step of vintaging bunches of grapes by

means of one or more automotive gathering machines, a
step of collecting grapes in a mobile trailer having a

capacity corresponding to the capacities of several
gathering machines, a transport step between the

gathering location and the wine-making plant, a pressing
step to extract the juice and a step of placing in a

fermentation vat, characterised by the fact that pressing
is at
 least partially effected during the step of
transporting the grapes between the vineyard and the

wine-making plant in a vehicle formed by means of a
vehicle having a part (8) for the storage of the grapes

this part (8) being covered after filling by a membrane
(14) which effects the tight closure of the said part

(8), and a part (9) for collecting the pressed juice, the
said parts (8, 9) being separated by a grid, the process

also consisting of discharging the pressed juice obtained
during the transport step directly into a fermentation

vat.
Process for the preparation of juice for wine-making
as described in claim 1, characterised by the fact that

the pressed grapes remaining in the transport and
pressing vehicle are charged into a fixed press installed

in the wine-making plant, the pressed juice from the said
fixed press being introduced into a fermentation vat

different from the fermentation vat intended for the
juice from pressing by means of the transport and

pressing vehicle. 
Process for the preparation of juice for wine-making
as described in either one of the preceding claims,

characterised by the fact that transport and pressing are
effected in a closed vehicle.
Process for the preparation of juice for wine-making
as described in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised by the fact that pressing during transport
is effected at a pressure of between 2.10
4
 and 6.10
4
 Pa.
Transport and pressing vehicle for carrying out the
process as described in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised by the fact that it consists of a chassis
with wheels (2, 3) supporting a tank divided into two

compartments (8, 9) separated by a grid (7) for
separation of the grapes and the juice, the grape

compartment (8) being covered after filling by a membrane
(14) which tightly closes the said grape compartment (8),

including means to apply a pressure differential of
approximately 2.10
4
 and 6.10
4
 Pa between the compartment
(8) intended for the grapes and the compartment (9)

intended for the juice, and means for tightly closing the
filling opening of the compartment intended for the

grapes.
Transport and pressing vehicle as described in claim
5, characterised by the fact that the compartment (8)

intended for pressing the grapes is covered, after
filling, by a membrane (14) which tightly closes the said

compartment (8).
Transport and pressing vehicle as described in claim
6, characterised by the fact that it includes a vacuum 

pump to apply a reduced pressure in the compartment (9)
intended to collect the juice.
Transport and pressing vehicle as described in claim
6 or claim 7, characterised by the fact that the

compartment intended for pressing (8) is covered, after
filling, as well as by the said membrane, by a rigid

cover and by the fact that it includes a compressor to
blow compressed air between the membrane (14) and the

rigid cover.
Transport and pressing vehicle as described in claim
8, characterised by the fact that the rigid cover is

mobile by tilting relative to one of the upper edges of
the said tank.
Transport and pressing vehicle as described in any
one of claims 5 to 9, characterised by the fact that the

separation grid (7) is concave, viewed from the side of
the compartment intended to receive the grapes.
