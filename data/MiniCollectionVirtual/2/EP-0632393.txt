<ABSTRACT>
A method of connecting an IC card to a 
motherboard, comprising steps of: 


(a) detecting that an IC card has been inserted 
into a connector located on said motherboard; 
(b) connecting a power bus of said motherboard 
to a power bus of said IC card; and 
(c) connecting a general signal bus of said 
motherboard to a general signal bus of said IC card; 
   in which said step (b) includes substeps as 
follows: 


(b1) allowing only a low current to flow between 
said power bus of said motherboard and said power bus of 

said IC card; 
(b2) waiting for a predetermined period of time, 
said predetermined period of time corresponding to the 

time it takes for voltage levels between said motherboard 
and said IC card to become equalized; and 
(b3) allowing a full current to flow between 
said power bus of said motherboard and said power bus of 

said IC card.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector
circuit for connecting an integrated circuit card (IC
card) to a motherboard. The connection is made in a hot
pluggable manner, meaning that when a card is being
connected to the motherboard, there is no need to
deactivate the motherboard bus.In the prior art, when a new IC card was being
connected to a motherboard bus, the motherboard bus had to
be deactivated, thus the bus could not be used by another
IC card which had previously been connected. Deactivation
was necessary because noise signals could be added to the
bus by the new card during insertion, such noise signals
negatively impacting the use of the bus by the existing IC
cards previously inserted. For example, data being
transmitted along the motherboard bus using an existing IC
card could be lost during insertion of the new IC card.Hot pluggable connections between IC cards and a
motherboard have been developed in which it is not
necessary to deactivate the motherboard bus during
insertion of a new card. In these prior art devices, edge
connectors are located on the IC cards for connection to
the motherboard. When the IC card is connected to a
corresponding receptacle on the motherboard, both power
connections to the electrical components on the IC card 
and general purpose signal connections (e.g. for data and
addresses) are established during the same connection. To
ensure a stable operation of the bus while a card is connected,
it is necessary to make sure that power and general
purpose signal connections are made in a certain order. For
example, it is better to have the power connections made
before the general purpose signal connections.In US-A-5210855, a connection sequence is described in
which first ground connections are made, then power connections
are made and finally general purpose signal connections
are made. However, a problem has existed in these
devices. Specifically, when the power connection is made
between the IC card and the motherboard bus, power is
applied to the card immediately. This causes a short circuit
to exist across the motherboard power bus. This can
cause many problems to occur as follows. First, physical
damage to the connectors can occur, for example, the connectors
can be depleted by the temporary short circuit.
Second, disturbances to the signal lines on the motherboard
bus can be created by the short circuit on the power bus by
electromagnetic interference. Third, regulated voltage
levels on the motherboard bus can be caused to fall out of
regulation, thus
