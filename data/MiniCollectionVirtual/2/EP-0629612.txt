<ABSTRACT>
Ureas are obtained by reaction, in basic medium, between an N
<
 omega 
>
-(aryloxycarbonyl)diamino acid and a compound containing a free amino group. The chirality of the compounds is outstandingly well preserved.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of ureins derived from an α,ω-diamino acid
according to which a compound containing a free amino group is reacted, in

basic medium, with a diamino acid derivative containing an N
ω
-aryloxycarbonyl
group.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the diamino acid
derivative used contains, as aryloxycarbonyl group, a group comprising from 7

to 15 carbon atoms.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that the aryloxycarbonyl
group is a phenyloxycarbonyl or naphtyloxycarbonyl group optionally

substituted by at least one group chosen from alkyl groups comprising from 1 to
4 carbon atoms and the nitro group.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that the aryloxycarbonyl
group is the phenyloxycarbonyl group.
Process according to any one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the compound comprising a free amino group is chosen from ammonia, primary

and secondary amines and amino acids.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in that the compound
comprizing a free amino group is an amino acid.
Process according to Claim 6, applied to the preparation of N
ω
 -carboxyalkylcarbamoyl-α,ω-diamino
acids of general formula



in which A represents a bivalent group consisting of a linear carbon chain
formed from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, which chain is optionally substitued by one or

a number of groups chosen from C
1
-C
3
 alkyl groups and functional groups
comprising at least one oxygen or sulphur atom such as a carboxyl, acyl,

hydroxyl, alkoxy or mercapto group, and in which R3-NH represents an amino
acid or a peptide. 
Process acording to Claim 6, applied to the preparation of cyclic ureins
of general formula



in which A represents a bivalent group consisting of a linear carbon chain
formed from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, which chain is optionally substituted by one or

a number of groups chosen from C
1
-C
3
 alkyl groups and functional groups
comprising at least one oxygen or sulphur atom such as a carboxyl, acyl,

hydroxyl, alkoxy or mercapto group, with the exception of 2-oxoimidazolidinyl-4-carboxylic
acid and (LD)-2-oxohexahydropyrimidinyl-4-carboxylic acid.
Process according to Claim 8 applied to the preparation of a cyclic
ureins in which A represents a trimethylene group -(CH
2
)
