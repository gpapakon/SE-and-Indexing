<ABSTRACT>
A heat pump device composed of a high-temperature-side 
heat pump (2) comprising a high-temperature-side 

cylinder (21) which receives therein 
a high-temperature-side displacer (22), and a low-temperature-side 

heat pump (3) comprising a low-temperature-side 
cylinder (31) which receives therein 

a low-temperature-side displacer (32). Rods (23, 33) 
connected to the respective displacers (22, 23) are 

connected to each other by a coupling mechanism 
(4). Volume regulating means (8a) is provided for 

changing a volume in an intermediate-temperature space 
(35) in the low-temperature-side rod (33). In addition, 

volume control means (9a) is provided for detecting 
the number of revolutions of a crankshaft (42) on 

the coupling mechanism (4), calculating a volume in 
the intermediate-temperature space (35), which volume 

corresponds to the above number of revolutions, and 
controlling the volume regulating means (8a) such that 

the volume in the intermediate-temperature space (35) 
eqals the calculated volume. Thus an improvement of a 

net COP (coefficient of performance) is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vuilleumier heat pump device 
and particularly relates to a countermeasure for controlling 
driving power of the vuilleumier heat pump device. In general, a vuilleumier heat pump device used in such 
as an air conditioner comprises a hot-side heat pump and a 
cold-side heat pump, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
laying Open Gazette No.1-137164. In the vuilleumier heat 
pump device, each of the heat pumps is so composed that a 
displacer is housed in a cylinder. Both the displacers of the 
hot-side and cold-side heat pumps are connected to each other 
so as to reciprocate at a set phase angle (e.g., 90° ). A hot 
space and a middle-temperature space in the hot side cylinder 
are communicated with each other through a hot side passage, 
while a cold space and a middle-temperature space in the cold 
side cylinder are communicated with each other through a cold 
side passage. Reciprocations of both the displacers change volumes of 
respective spaces above-mentioned in the cylinders, so that a  
 
working gas is changed in pressure to form a thermodynamic 
cycle. Heat input is conducted at a heater and a cooler on the 
hot side and cold side passages, while heat radiation is 
conducted at middle-temperature heat exchangers on both the 
passages. Further, in the hot-side heat pump, heat is stored 
in a regenerator on the hot side passage when a working gas 
moves from the hot space to the middle-temperature space, 
while heat stored in the regenerator is regenerated when a 
working gas moves from the middle-temperature space to the hot 
space. In the cold-side heat pump, heat is stored in a regenerator 
on the cold side passage when a working gas moves from 
the middle-temperature space to the cold space, while heat 
stored in the regenerator is regenerated when a working gas 
moves from the cold space to the middle-temperate space. In the above-mentioned vuilleumier heat pump device, a 
rod of one displacer is connected to a rod of another displacer 
via a connection mechanism. A crank shaft of the connection 
mechanism is connected to an auxiliary driving motor as an 
auxiliary driving power source. The auxiliary driving motor 
enables the displacers to reciprocate. That is, when a rotation 
speed of the crank shaft increases over its self operating 
point, the auxiliary driving motor gives auxiliary driving 
power to the crank shaft. On the contrary, when the rotation 
speed of the crank shaft decreases below its self operating  
 
point, the auxiliary driving motor
