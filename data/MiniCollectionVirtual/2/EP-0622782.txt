<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive having a passive slider exhibiting 
two fly heights, one for recording and reading 

operations and a second for idling, is disclosed. The 
disk drive has a magnetic recording surface set for 

rotation in a direction. A transducer carrier is 
radially positionable relative to the magnetic 

recording surface and can be moved between recording 
portions and idling portions of the annular surface. 

In the idling zone the surface includes a plurality of 
shallow depressions (84,86) disposed in an annular 

zone. The depressions are generally trench like. The 
orientation of the depressions depends on the type 

carrier for the transducer. If oriented transversely 
to the direction of rotation of the magnetic recording 

surface, they will boost pressure under the carrier 
increasing or introducing spacing between the body and 

the carrier. Where the carrier has an air bearing 
surface including regions creating zones of relatively 

negative pressure, the depressions are grooves 
paralleling the direction of rotation of the disk. The 

grooves diminish the effectiveness of the zones of 
negative pressure to increase carrier fly height.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to direct access type 
magnetic storage systems including rigid disk drive 
systems and contact type read/record systems (e.g. 
floppy or diskette systems). More particularly the 
invention relates to apparatus for increasing fly 
height between a read head or slider and the recording 
media when positioned over a modified zone on the 
surface of the recording media. A disk drive (hard drive) is an information 
storage device which utilizes at least one rotatable 
magnetic disk to store information. The information is 
represented on the disk as a series of magnetically 
orientated regions. The magnetic regions are arrayed 
along the surface of the disk on either a plurality of 
concentric data tracks or spiral data tracks. 
Transducers generate magnetically orientated regions 
and sense such regions to store and read data on the 
disk. In so-called hard drives, a transducer is mounted 
on a carrier called a slider. In operation, the slider 
flies just off the surface of the disk. Separation of 
the slider and disk reduces wear and consequent 
premature destruction of the components. An extremely 
low fly height of the slider is used to achieve high 
density data storage. High stability in fly height is 
required for accurate data storage, data signal 
reproduction and the avoidance of collision between 
slider and disk.  A slider flies as a result of the relative 
movement of the disk surface and the slider. This 
movement creates a cushion of air between the disk and 
the slider forcing the slider and the disk apart. The 
face of the slider toward the disk is known as the air 
bearing surface. Design of a slider air bearing 
surface, a suspension system for the slider and an 
actuator arm for slider positioning are directed to 
achieving a low mass assembly and a high degree of 
positional stability of the slider for a broad range of 
disk drive unit operating conditions. The suspension system provides dimensional 
stability between the slider and the actuator arm by 
compensating for the force of the air between the air 
bearing surface and the disk surface as well as 
providing rapid motion damping of the slider following 
repositioning from one track to another. The 
suspension system should control slider position 
relative to its directions of motion between tracks 
while resisting out-of-plane movement relative the 
preferred fly height above the disk surface. At no 
time during data read or write operations of the drive 
should the slider come into contact with the disk
