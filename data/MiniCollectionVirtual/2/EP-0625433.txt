<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method to produce decorative 
lining sheet for furniture elements and lined elements thus 
produced for furniture items of a container type, such as 
cupboards, etc., as set forth in the respective main claims. To be more exact, this invention concerns a method to 
produce a decorative lining sheet which is applied to 
suitably shaped filler cores so as to form lined elements 
for furniture items of a container type. The invention is applied to the furniture industry and 
especially to the production of lined elements for furniture 
items of a container type, the elements including a filler 
core of compressed wood chips, medium density fibreboard or 
foamed material and having their front surface smooth or 
shaped with mouldings, cornices, ornaments, etc. The lined elements made for furniture items of a container 
type by the method according to the invention can be used 
in the production of furniture either as sidewalls or work 
surfaces, or as small doors and/or doors for cupboards, etc. Lined elements for furniture items of a container type, 
such as cupboards, etc., where the elements consist of a 
shaped filler core generally composed of compressed wood 
chips, medium density fibreboard or foamed material lined on 
one or more faces with a decorative sheet of a plastic 
material, are included in the state of the art. The plastic material most commonly used nowadays is PVC. 
The PVC sheet is supplied at present in rolls and is printed 
with a roller that prints the desired decorative design on 
the PVC. The decorated PVC sheet is varnished thereafter for  
 
protective purposes and is possibly embossed to obtain in 
relief the imprint of the design, with a view to designing 
the pores of the wood, for instance. This method requires great investments owing to the high 
cost of the rollers that print the PVC sheet. These high 
costs do not allow the production of small quantities of PVC 
sheets decorated with a particular design inasmuch as only a 
considerable production of PVC sheets with a particular 
design can justify the investments involved by these 
printing rollers. For this reason only big plants to produce decorated PVC 
sheets exist at the present time, and these big plants 
therefore supply only big quantities with resulting high 
plant costs and long delivery times for the material. Moreover, the decoration and colours produced on the PVC 
sheets possess a definition which is not always satisfactory 
from an aesthetic point of view. Furthermore, where the
