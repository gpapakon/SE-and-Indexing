<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for shaping perforations of sheet material (16) which comprises a first mould structure (18, 44) at one side of the sheet material and a complementary mould structure (30, 52) at the other side of the sheet material to cooperate with the first mould structure wherein the structures are arranged to be reciprocated and are capable of meeting approximately half way through the sheet material whereby to shape the perforations between them. The apparatus can include a needle (10) so that perforations are simultaneously formed and shaped, or it may be used to shape pre-formed perforations. If a needle is included it may be of the ultrasonic type or it may be heated, e.g. electrically heated (40). If a needle is used, one of the mould structures may be defined by an appropriate formation (32) on the needle, or the structure may be separate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
perforating, or shaping the perforations of, thermoplastic
sheets, for example plain or corrugated polyolefin sheets.Containers for the preservation and transport of food stuffs
may be made from thermoplastic sheet material so as to be
solid, light and economical. However, when used for the
transport and storage of wares having a high moisture content,
for example fruit or vegetables, deterioration of the product
may occur owing to build up of moisture within the container.
It has been proposed to provide such containers with a
plurality of holes, for example by forming them from perforated
sheets, and this reduces the problem considerably.However, when the sheets are perforated with heated needles or
punches alone, or similar techniques where direct heat is used
to melt the material (including the use of lasers), the melted
material forms a deposit, as indicated at 1 in Figure 1 of the
accompanying drawings. The deposit 1 is upstanding from the
general plane of the face of the corrugated sheet and therefore
provides a trap or barrier for retention of moisture 2 which
can both lead to deterioration of the packed product, in
particular fruit and vegetables, and unwanted variations of the
tare (unloaded weight) of the package.If perforation of the sheet is carried out using conventional
ultra sonic equipment, as illustrated in Figure 2 of the
accompanying drawings, the moisture retention and stagnation
problem is avoided but instead a different problem arises.
This is the weakening of the whole structure due to the large
sealing area 3 which is needed and the unbalanced deformation
of the sheet as illustrated at 4, both of which affect the
mechanical performance of the package. US-A-2633441 describes an apparatus for perforating plastic
board which comprises a pair of die members which are advanced
from opposite sides of the board and pinch two portions of the
facing sheets abutting the holes into engagement with each
other.EP-A-0339593 discloses a perforating device for thermoplastic
sheet comprising a cylindrical body ending in a cone-shaped or
truncated cone-shaped tip having a fixed needle or a movable
coaxial needle connected with a piston.The present invention seeks to provide a method and apparatus
for producing perforations in thermoplastic sheet materials
which are improved in the above respects.According to the present invention there is provided an
apparatus for shaping perforation in plastics sheet material
with the features as mentioned in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for shaping perforation in plastics sheet
material (16) which comprises one mould structure (18,30,44,52)

at one side of the sheet material and a complementary mould
structure (18,30,44,52) at the other side of the sheet material

to cooperate with the first mould structure together with a
plunger (10',22), at least one of the structures and/or the

plunger being adapted to be heated
and one of this mould structures having a needle (10, 10'),

the mould structures being
capable of meeting approximately halfway through the sheet

material, whereby one of the structures cooperates with the
plunger (10', 22) whereby to perforate the material thereafter the

plunger is withdrawn and the other mould structure cooperates
with the first to shape the perforation (34) and seal the sheet

characterised in that one of the mould structures is defined by
an outwardly disposed partly circular portion (30, 52) at or near the

upper end of a cylindrical portion (12) of the needle (10)
which cooperates with a similar corresponding peripheral

portion (28, 44) on the other mould structure (20)
by being moved toward each other

whereby to form
a smooth half-circular section bead (34, 34c) on the final perforated

product.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the plunger is the
needle (10').
An apparatus as claimed in either of claim 1 or 2 in which
one of the mould structures (30) incorporates the needle (10).
An apparatus as claimed in either of claims 2 of 3 in which
the needle (10) is of the ultra-sonic type or is heated, e.g.

electrically.
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4 in which
the needle or ultra-sonic electrode (10) has a generally

cylindrical main section (12) and a tapered or conical end
portion (14) suitable for penetrating the thermoplastic sheet, and

the circular portion is at or near the upper end of the cylindrical
main section of the needle. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 2 to 5 in which
the mould structures (44,52) are capable of reciprocation with

respect to one another and independently of the needle (10')
whereby to form a bead (34c).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6 in which the mould
structures are easily exchangeable so as to alter the bead

shape.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7 in which the mould
structures are provided with associated reservoirs (50,60) of

cooling or heating fluid.
A method for shaping perforations in plastics sheet
material (16) with an apparatus according any preceding claim

which comprises presenting a first mould structure
(18,30,44,52) to one side of the sheet material and a

complementary mould structure (18,30,44,52) to the other side
of the sheet material applying heat, and bringing the mould

structures towards one another so that they meet approximately
half way through the sheet material whereby to shape the

perforation between them, and moving mould structures (10, 18; 44, 52) toward one
another whereby to form a bead (34, 34a to 34c).
