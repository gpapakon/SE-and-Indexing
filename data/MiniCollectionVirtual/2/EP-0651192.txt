<ABSTRACT>
A device (3) for indicating the operating state of a linear 
actuation valve (5) 

comprises a mounting plate (9) having a rectilinear slot (11) therein 
for slidably receiving 

a perpendicularly extending follower stem (6) fixed to 
a follower nut (4). The nut (4) is 

threaded to the exterior of a sleeve (7) which is 
mounted for conjoint rotation with the 

hub of a hand wheel (2) of the linear actuation valve. 
Engagement of the follower stem 

(6) with the slot (9) prevents rotation of the 
nut (4) and provokes it to moveaxially relative 

to the sleeve (7). 
The mounting plate (9) also includes means 
for fixing sensors (15) and (16) to the 

plate for detecting arrival of the follower stem (6) 
moving along the slotin either of two 

positions to be detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for indicating the operating state
of a linear actuation valve, to show e.g. whether the valve is fully open or fully shut.This device may be fitted on the valve, for example between the valve wheel and
the bonnet of the linear actuation valve, and is provided with sensors which will indicate
whether the valve is fully open or fully shut.Owing to the ever-increasing growth of remote control systems meant to operate
some kind of process, the need has been felt for various kinds of device to indicate
fundamental parameters for different sorts of equipment. As regards manually-operated
linear actuation shut-off or block valves, which valves are widely used in the flow of
liquids, it is becoming important that the operating state of the valve - whether open or
shut - be known at a remote location.Various ways of dealing with this problem have been put forward. EP-A-0369918
teaches the use of two coils concentrically fitted to the valve shutter, the first
coil inducing a voltage in the second coil, in a direct relationship to the position of the
valve shutter so as to enable the state of the valve to be correctly indicated.This arrangement works well but one of its chief drawbacks is that because there
are a lot of mechanical and electrical parts, the manufacturing cost is high, and the large
number of electrical parts makes it more likely to break down.US-A-4967792 brings in the use of small magnetized parts fixed to the valve
stem, together with a device fitted between the bonnet and the valve wheel and able to
detect the magnetic field generated about such small parts when they pass close to sensors
lying within the device. A signal is thereby generated to indicate the operating state of
the valve, that is, whether it is open or shut.This arrangement works well but is hampered by the fact that the valve stem has
to be drilled, thereby diminishing the valve stem cross-sectional area which may affect
strength of the stem at such drilled points.US-A-2,407,944 discloses an indicator device comprising an externally threaded
sleeve (7) to be connected to the handwheel (9) of a "non-rising stem" valve 
to surround the valve shaft (stem) for rotation synchronously with the handwheel, and
a follower nut (12) screwed onto the sleeve and having a follower stem (13) extending
perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the threaded sleeve and engaging with a
rectilinear slot (16) on a plate (17) to prevent rotation of the nut as it moves along the
axis of the valve shaft or stem

A device for indicating the operating state of a linear actuation valve (5) having
a rotatable valve shaft (1) carrying a handwheel (2), said device comprising an externally

threaded sleeve (7) for arrangement around said shaft (1), means for connecting the
sleeve (7) to the handwheel (2) for rotation synchronously therewith, a follower nut (4)

screwed on to said externally threaded sleeve (7), and means (6, 9, 11) for preventing
rotation of said follower nut (4) during rotation of said threaded sleeve (7), said means

(6, 9, 11) comprising a follower stem (6) fixed to said follower nut (4) and extending
perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the sleeve (7), and a plate (9) having a

rectilinear slot (11) formed therein, said slot (11) cooperating with said follower stem
(6); characterised in that sensors (15, 16) are provided for sensing the position of said

follower stem (6) relative to said plate (9) to detect the arrival of the linear actuation
valve in one or other of two operating states, for example the valve open state and the

valve closed state; and in that the sensors (15, 16) are mounted on said plate (9) by
means of slots (12, 13) allowing the positions of the sensors (15, 16) on the plate to be

adjusted so that the sensors can sense the longitudinal movement of said follower nut (4)
relative to the plate during rotation of said externally threaded sleeve (7).
A device according to claim 1, and including a collar (8) on said externally
threaded sleeve and having holes (17) for attachment bolts to secure the collar to the hub

of a said handwheel (2) of a linear actuation valve whose state is to be sensed.
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said plate (9) has holes (10)
enabling it to be screwed to the 

bonnet of a linear actuation valve (5) whose state is to be
sensed.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said sensors (15, 16) are mechanical sensors requiring

contact with said follower stem (6) to indicate arrival of the
follower stem at a position corresponding to the desired

operating state to be sensed.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
sensors (15, 16) are electronic proximity sensors which do not

require physical contact for sensing the valve operating state.
