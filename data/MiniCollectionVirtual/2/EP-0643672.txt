<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a wastewater purification plant comprises the steps of measuring two or more of a number of parameters, automatically controlling the plant on the basis of the measurement values obtained using a mathematical model for the purification process, evaluating the quality of the measurement value for at least one parameter on the basis of a comparison of the said value with an expected, dynamic value interval calculated continuously on the basis of said mathematical model and a simultaneous and/or a previous measurement of one or several other parameters and/or a previous measurement of the same parameter, and controlling the plant on the basis of the quality evaluated measurement values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling a waste 
water purification plant comprising the steps of measuring two or 
more of a number of parameters, such as the concentration of 
ammonium, nitrate, oxygen and phosphate and oxygen supply, and 
automatically controlling the plant on the basis of the measurement 
values obtained using a mathematical model for the purification 
process. When treating e.g. municipal waste water, where a removal of 
nitrogen and phosphate containing compounds and organic matter is 
typically desired, in a biological purification plant considerable 
variations occur during a day both in the concentration of the 
polluting substances in the waste water and in the amount of waste 
water supplied to the purification plant. The great variation in the 
load of the plant makes heavy demands on the control of the plant in 
order to avoid that the concentration of the polluting substances in 
the effluent exceeds the maximum limit values. The control of biological purification plants is typically based on 
measurements of primarily phosphate, nitrate, ammonium and oxygen 
carried out with photo or electro chemical electrodes (sensor 
systems). Such sensor systems are very sensitive and require 
continuous maintenance and frequent calibration, in particular in 
connection with measurements carried out in liquid mixtures from 
biological purification plants, which i.a. is due to the fact that 
such liquid mixtures contain many interfering substances, and that 
the particles and active sludge contained therein give rise to 
bacterial growth in the sensor systems as well as clogging thereof. As a result thereof, measurements carried out using sensors, and in 
particular the measurements of nitrate and ammonium, are very 
unreliable and present a central problem in the control of 
biological purification plants. "Computer Control of an Alternating Activated Sludge Process" by 
KÃ¼mmel M. and Nielsen M.K., published at The International Symposium  
 
on Process Systems Engineering, Kyoto, August 23-27, 1982 discloses 
a method of controlling a biological purification plant comprising 
two treatment tanks which are alternately operated in anoxic and 
aerobic conditions and wherein the flow pattern is changed 
accordingly and so that the untreated waste water is supplied to the 
anoxic tank, from which it is carried to the aerobic tank and 
therefrom further on in the plant to a clarification tank in which a 
sedimentation of active sludge is carried out, which sludge is 
subseq

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling a waste water purification plant 
comprising the steps of measuring two or more of a number of 

parameters and automatically controlling the plant on the basis of 
the measurement values obtained using a mathematical model for the 

purification process, 
characterized
 in that the quality 
of the measurement value for at least one parameter is evaluated on 

the basis of a comparison of the said value with an expected, 
dynamic value interval calculated continuously on the basis of the 

mathematical model and a simultaneous and/or an earlier measurement 
of one or several other parameters, and that the plant is controlled 

on the basis of said evaluated measurement values. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

that the expected, dynamic value interval is calculated on the basis 

of the mathematical model and a simultaneous and/or an earlier 
measurement of one or several other parameters and a previous 

measurement of the same parameter. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the expected, dynamic measurement interval is determined by 

calculation of an expected, dynamic value and maximum deviations 
therefrom. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that the credibility of the measurement value 

is evaluated on the basis of the comparison of the measurement value 
with the expected, dynamic value interval by allocation of a 

credibility factor which in combination with the measurement value 
is used in the subsequent selection of the final control action. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the measurement value is corrected with a 
value corresponding to the magnitude of identifiable measurement 

interference, if any, and that the corrected measurement value is 
used in subsequent selection of the final control action. 
A method according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in  
 

that the quantification of the identifiable measurement interference 
is carried out on the basis of the mathematical model and past data 

of response courses for control modifications of the same type 
previously made. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized

(control apparatus) collecting and storing measurement results and 

control signals, processing the collected data using the 
mathematical model and implementing new control actions. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 


characterized
 in that the controlled waste water purification 
plant is a biological waste water purification plant wherein the 

purification is carried out by means of microorganisms.
