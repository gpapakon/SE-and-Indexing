<CLAIMS>
Use of a glutathione alkyl ester corresponding to 
the formula: 


 
in which: 


R represents an alkyl radical having from 1 to 10 carbon 
atoms, for the preparation of a cosmetic or dermatological 

composition intended for the topical treatment of 
cutaneous ageing. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the said glutathione alkyl ester is glutathione 

monomethyl ester, monoethyl ester or monooctyl ester. 
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized by 
the fact that the said glutathione alkyl ester is present 

in the composition at a concentration of between 0.01 % 
and 10 %, and preferably between 0.5 and 5 % by weight 

relative to the total weight of the composition. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said composition 

comprises, in addition, an additional active ingredient 
at a concentration of between 0.001 and 10 % by weight 

relative to the total weight of the composition. 
Use according to Claim 4, characterized by the 
fact that the said additional active ingredient is chosen 

from optionally modified purified or unpurified superoxide 
dismutase or a substance having a superoxide 

dismutase activity. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said composition  

 
comprises, in addition, at least one metal-chelating 

agent. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said composition 

comprises, in addition, pigments of metallic oxides. 
Use according to Claim 7, characterized by the 
fact that the said pigments are present in the composition 

at a concentration of between 0.1 and 15 % and 
preferably between 0.5 and 10 % by weight relative to the 

total weight of the composition. 
Cosmetic or dermatological composition intended 
for the topical treatment of cutaneous ageing, characterized 

by the fact that it contains a glutathione alkyl 
ester of formula (I) and a superoxide dismutase. 
Cosmetic or dermatological composition according 
to Claim 9, characterized by the fact that the said 

glutathione alkyl ester is present in a proportion of 
between 0.01 % and 10 % and preferably between 0.5 and 

5 % and that the said superoxide dismutase is present in 
a proportion of between 0.001 and 10 % by weight relative 

to the total weight of the composition.
