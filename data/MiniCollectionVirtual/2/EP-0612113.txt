<ABSTRACT>
Superconductors using oxide superconducting 
materials having pinning centers inside crystal grains are 

enhanced in transmissible critical current density and 
allowed to have a high critical 
current density even in the 
magnetic field. A superconductor is produced comprising 

superconducting materials having a high irreversible 
magnetic field where the c axes of their crystals are 

oriented in one direction. This can be practically realized 
by heat-treating a superconducting material having a 

composition expressed by the Composition:

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide based 
superconducting material capable of exhibiting a 
superconductive property when cooled with liquid helium or 
liquid nitrogen, a superconductor capable of transmitting a 
superconducting current under cooled condition with liquid 
helium or liquid nitrogen, a process for the production 
thereof, and a superconducting wire, superconducting coil, 
and magnetic shield substance comprising the superconducting 
material. Conventional high temperature oxide based 
superconducting containing Tl, Sr, Ca, Cu, and O as major 
elements have a superconducting critical temperature as high 
as about 120 K as reported in Physica C vol. 183, pp. 67-72; 
Proceedings, Vol. 235, Materials Research Society Symposium, 
Boston, Dec. 1st-6th, 1991; Japanese Patent KOKAI (Laid-open) 
No. Hei 4-300202; and Japanese Patent KOKAI (Laid-open) 
No. Hei 5-816. Although they are very promising 
materials which could have succeeded in the introduction of 
pinning centers thereinto, i.e., the prerequisite for 
achieving a high critical current density, they are  
 
difficult to retain such a high critical current density as 
transmission current when formed into superconducting wires 
as well as to make into practical products, through which an 
actual superconducting current can be passed. Satisfactory consideration has not been given 
heretofore to the electrical connections between the crystal 
particles of superconducting material present in the 
conventional superconducting wires, i.e., the connections of 
grain boundaries, across which a sufficient superconducting 
current can be passed. Therefore, there has been a problem 
that the critical current density is drastically reduced 
only by applying a slight magnetic field to the 
superconducting materials. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
superconductor comprising a high temperature oxide base 
superconducting material which can exhibit a higher critical 
current density even in a magnetic field by improving the 
electrical connection between the crystal grains of 
superconducting material present in the superconductor. Figure 1 shows the crystalline structure obtained 
in Example 1. Figure 2 shows the crystalline structure obtained 
in Example 2. Figure 3 shows the crystalline structure obtained  
 
in Example 3. Figure 4 shows the crystalline structure of the 
material having a property of growing in the form of plate 
crystal obtained in Example 4 according to the present 
invention. Figure 5 shows the
