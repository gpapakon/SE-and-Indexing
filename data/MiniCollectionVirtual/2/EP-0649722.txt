Hydraulic device for supplying a driving unit (10) in an injection moulding machine
for processing plastics materials, comprising a control for controling at

least one control pump (15), a main line (16) extending from the control pump
(15) to the driving unit (10), at least one controllable or adjustable valve (14)

which is disposed in the main line (16) and determines quantity (Q
actual
) and
pressure (P
actual
), a control line (17) which connects the adjusting mechanism
(15a) of the control pump (15) to the main line (16) downstream of the valve (14),

and at least one pressure sensor (13) for determining actual pressure values
downstream of the valve (14), which values, after comparison with a desired

pressure value (P
desired
), supply a correcting variable (y
1
) for the adjusting
mechanism (15a) in order to follow-up the operational pressure gradient as far as

the pressure sensor (13), 
characterised in that
 the control pump (15) is driven by
a rotary current motor (18) known per se, which is connected to the current

source via a frequency converter (19) known per se so as to be adjustable in respect
of the speed (n
mot
), so that the maximum capacity (Q
max
) of the control
pump (15) is predetermined by the frequency converter, by virtue of values prescribed

for the respective injection cycle, in dependence on a correcting variable
(y
2
), which is dependent on quantity and pressure, and 
in that
 the pumping capacity
of the control pump (15) is actively adjustable by the control (12) below its

maximum capacity at the adjusting mechanism (15a) by the correcting variable
(y
1
).
Hydraulic device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 correcting variable
(y
2
) is calculated separately for individual sections of an injection cycle.
Hydraulic device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

a speed transmitter picks-up the speed of the rotary current motor (18) and 
in
that
 the speed is adjusted by means of the frequency converter (19).
