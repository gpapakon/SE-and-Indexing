<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a check valve, especially for sanitary water fittings, on which the valve closure member (11) preferably consists of a cone (4) and a cone cap (5) having a domed attachment (12) with a lateral exit aperture (9) in the closing direction of the check valve in which there is the valve closure member (8) of an overpressure valve (10), while in the opening direction of the check valve the cone (4) has a tubular extension (14) having a lateral inlet aperture, the upper end of which forms a seat (15) for the valve closure member (8) of the overpressure valve (10). This valve closure member (8) is supported on the head (16) of the attachment (12) on the side away from the valve seat (15).

<CLAIMS>
A non-return valve, in particular for sanitary water fittings, 
comprising a valve seat (1) and a valve closure portion (11), which is 

provided with a pressure-relief valve (10) which is operative, that is to 
say openable, in the closing direction of the non-return valve, 

characterised in that its valve closure portion (11) is composed of a 
cone (4) and a cone cap (5) which in the closing direction of the non-return 

valve is provided with a cap-like portion (12) thereon which has a 
lateral discharge opening (9) and in which is disposed the valve closure 

portion (8) of the pressure-relief valve (10) while in the opening 
direction of the non-return valve the cone (4) has a tubular projection 

portion (14) which has a lateral intake opening (13) and whose end which 
is in the closing direction of the non-return valve forms a valve seat 

(15) for the valve closure portion (8) of the pressure-relief valve (10), 
wherein said valve closure portion (8) on the side remote from its valve 

seat (15) bears against the head (16) of the cap-like portion (12). 
A non-return valve according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the valve closure portion (8) of the pressure-relief valve (10) is formed 

from an elastic shaped portion. 
A non-return valve according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in 
that the shaped portion (8) consists of rubber.
