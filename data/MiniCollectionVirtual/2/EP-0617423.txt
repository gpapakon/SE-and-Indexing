formed of a fixed data pattern having a predetermined bit number is 
inserted at a predetermined time interval L. The synchronizing signal 

generating apparatus is comprised of a delay circuit (21, 22, 23, 24, 
25) for obtaining a plurality of digital data having a delay time of n 

times (n is a positive integer) as long as the predetermined time 
interval L by delaying the digital data at the unit of the time 

interval L, a bit shift detector (26) for detecting a phase coincident 
with the fixed data pattern by delaying the digital data at the bit 

unit, a plurality of bit shifters (27, 28, 29, 30, 31) for bit-shifting 
of a plurality of digital data (D0, D1, D2, D3, D4) outputted from the 

delay circuit in response to detected result of the bit shift detector, 
a plurality of synchronizing detectors (32, 33, 34, 35, 36) for 

detecting whether or not a plurality of digital data bit-shifted by the 
plurality of the bit shifters and the fixed data pattern are coincident 

with each other, and a synchronizing signal generating circuit for 
generating a synchronizing signal in response to an output signal of 

the synchronizing detector which detected coincidence between the 
digital data and the fixed data pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synchronizing
signal generator for use in an apparatus which detects a
synchronizing signal of digital data.Heretofore, digital data is comprised of sync.
(synchronizing) pattern, data ID0 (ID number assigned to each of
sync. blocks which will be described later on) and data ID1
(representing content of data) all of which are needed when
digital data is reproduced. FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings
shows an arrangement of a conventional synchronizing signal
generator for generating a synchronizing signal by detecting a
sync. pattern of digital data, for example.As shown in FIG. 1, digital data supplied from some
suitable means, such as a reproducing system of a digital VTR
(video tape recorder), not shown, or the like, is supplied to an
input terminal 1. The digital data thus supplied to the input
terminal 1 is supplied to a delay circuit 2, a variable shift
register (VSR) 7 and a bit shift detector 6 which will be
described later on. The delay circuit 2 delays the digital data
supplied thereto through the input terminal 1 by a predetermined
delay time L. Delayed data outputted from the delay circuit 2
is further delayed by a delay circuit 3 by a delay time 5L. A
variable shift register (VSR) 4 latches therein output data Dx
of the delay circuit 3 on the basis of a control signal supplied 
thereto from a bit shift phase corrector 16 which will be
described later on. A latched output signal from the variable
shift register 4 is supplied to some suitable means, such as the
reproducing system of the digital VTR (not shown) or the like
through an output terminal 5. The above predetermined delay
time L has a duration corresponding to a length of one sync.
block which will be described later on.The bit shift detector 6 detects a bit shift amount of
digital data D0 supplied thereto through the input terminal 1 on
the basis of bit shift information contained in the sync.
pattern which will be described later on. Detected shift amount
data (referred to hereinafter simply as "signal" when necessary)
PH0 representing a shift amount from the bit shift detector 6 is
supplied to variable shift registers (VSRs) 7, 10 and the bit
shift phase corrector 16 which will be described later on,
respectively.The variable shift register 7 bit-shifts the digital
data D0 supplied thereto through the input terminal 1 on the
basis of the shift amount data PH0 representing a shift amount
from the bit shift detector 6. The variable shift register 10
bit-shifts digital data D1, delayed by the delay
