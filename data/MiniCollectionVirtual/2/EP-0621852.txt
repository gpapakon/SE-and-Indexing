<ABSTRACT>
A film dispenser includes a housing having bottom (2), front (5), rear (4) and side walls and a pivotally mounted top cover (6). The front wall (5) defines a substantially elongate opening (8). Film or wrap severing means (15) are provided at or adjacent said opening. An elongate and transversely extending support recess (20) is provided within said housing and rearwardly of the opening, so as to allow for an elongate roll of film or wrap to be located therewithin. A pivotally mounted pressure flap (25) is provided within the housing and is positioned above and apart from said support recess. A roll of film or wrap is adapted to be located within said support recess (20), with said pressure flap (25) providing a downward pressure thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for dispensing film and 
wrap, such as for example plastic film or wrap, polyethylene 
cling wrap and the like. It is particularly relevant to the 
dispensing of plastic film or wrap of the kind that is 
provided in roll form, normally disposed around a cylindrical 
core. Cling wraps and films are common household and commercial 
products, used for example in the packaging of a great 
diversity of products, including foods, magazines, stationery 
and many other consumer goods. In many cases, such film or 
wrap is supplied as a cylindrical roll extending about a core 
(such as for example a cardboard core). In use, only limited 
length of film or wrap are required from time to time for any 
particular use, and thus means are usually provided in 
association with said rolls of film or wrap, for the cutting 
of film or wrap as may be desired. It is common to use cardboard boxes for packaging such film 
or wrap which have also included a serrated metallic blade on 
an exterior surface for cutting the film. This has proved to 
be unsatisfactory in so far as the film often folds up over 
onto itself (especially due to its inherent clinging nature). 
Further, such serrated blades often become blunt before the 
roll of film has been fully used and, being disposable, are 
not environmentally acceptable to many people. Alternative methods and arrangements have been proposed 
whereby containers or housings are provided, which involve 
the utilisation of severing means in the form of a hot wire, 
operated by electrical power or battery or the like. This  
 
wire is used to quickly melt through the film to provide an 
even cut. Australian patent 544,332 and US patent 4,427,144 
disclose a film and wrap dispenser which uses hot-wire 
severing means and a drop-plate to prevent accidental contact 
with the wire, the drop-plate being raised to uncover the 
wire by raising the film. Whether serrated blades or hot-wires are used as the severing 
means, it is desirable to maintain a certain tension on the 
film as it is being severed to ensure that the cut is even 
and straight. If the tension is too great, the film may be 
prone to stretch and/or tear as it is being cut; if it is too 
little, the film will tend to drag over the severing means as 
it is being cut. Some prior dispensers address this problem by mounting the 
rolls on rotatable lugs or axles which provide a uniform 
resistance to the rotation of the roll, giving a tension 
which is substantially independent of the diameter

<CLAIMS>
A film and wrap dispenser including a housing (1) having a 
bottom wall (2), a front wall (5), a rear wall (4) and a 

top cover (6) extending transversely between a pair of side 
walls (3); an elongate and transversely extending opening 

(8) formed by said front wall through which the film or 
wrap may be dispensed; transversely extending film or wrap 

severing means (15) at or adjacent said opening for 
severing film or wrap dispenser through the opening; an 

elongate transversely extending recess (20) within said 
housing to the rear of said opening for accommodating an 

elongate roll of film or wrap (7); an elongate transversely 
extending pressure flap (25) pivotally mounted within the 

housing so that it is adapted to rest upon a roll of film 
or wrap (7) accommodated within the recess (20) and maintaining 

tension in film or wrap dispensed through said opening (8); 
the film and wrap dispenser being characterised in that: 


a transversely extending substantially planar fixed 
base plate (10) is located at the base of the opening 

(8) in the front wall (5), said fixed base plate being 
spaced below the severing means (15); 
a transversely extending moveable plate (11) having 
front and a rear edges is pivotally mounted at or near 

its rear edge within the opening between said fixed 
base plate (10) and the severing means (15) so that 

the front edge of said movable plate (11) normally 
rests upon said fixed base plate (10); 
a transversely extending cover plate (12) extending 
upwardly from said movable plate (11) and having a 

upper edge provided with a downwardly extending lip 
(14) that extends over the severing means (15) to 

normally shroud and thus protect it 
(8); 
the arrangement is such that, when a roll of film or 
wrap (7) is located in the recess (20) and the free 

end of the film or wrap is withdrawn upwardly under 
tension from the opening between said fixed and  

 
movable plates (10 and 11), the front edge of the 

movable plate and the cover plate (12) are moved 
upwards by the film or wrap to expose the severing 

means (15) for severing contact with the film or wrap; 
and 
the arrangement is such that, after severance of the 
film or wrap by contact with the severing means (15), 

(i) the movable plate (11) returns to its normal 
position to rest upon the fixed plate (10) and to 

thereby capture the end of the film or wrap between it 
and the fixed plate, and (ii), the cover plate (12) 

returns to its normal position so that its lip shrouds 
the severing means (15). 
A film and wrap dispenser according to claim 1, 
characterised in that: 


said movable plate (11) and said cover plate (12) are 
formed integrally with one another, 
the cover plate is attached to the movable plate near 
the rear edge of the movable plate. 
A film and wrap dispenser according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that: 


said severing means comprises a taut wire (15) adapted 
to be heated by electrical power, and 
the cover plate (12) extends upwardly from the movable 
plate (11) above and to the rear of said wire so that 

said lip (14) extends forwards over said wire and 
downwardly in front of the wire when the cover plate 

(12) and the movable plate (11) are in their normal 
positions. 
A film and wrap dispenser according to any preceding 
claim, characterised in that:  

 

said pressure flap (25) is pivoted about a transverse 
pivot axis located above that of a full roll of film 

or wrap located in the recess (20) so that the 
underside of said flap rests on a roll in the recess,, 
the underside of said flap is of a substantially 
concave configuration where it rests upon a roll of 

film or wrap (7) located within the recess (20), and 
said pivot axis is located in the front-to-back 
direction so that the flap (25) applies a frictional 

force on a roll of film or wrap (7) located within the 
recess (20) which is substantially inversely 

proportional to the diameter of the roll. 
A film and wrap dispenser as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that: 


stopper lugs (30) extend downwardly from adjacent each 
end of said pressure flap (25) so as to be adapted to 

transversely locate a roll of film or wrap (7) 
therebetween. 
A film and wrap dispenser as claimed in claim 5, 
characterised in that: 


each of said stopper lugs (30) is removably attached 
to the pressure flap (25) so that its transverse 

position with respect to the flap is adjustable, 
whereby rolls of film or wrap (7) having different 

lengths may be transversely located between said lugs. 
A film and wrap dispenser according to any preceding 
claim, characterised in that: 


said fixed base plate (10) is formed integrally with 
the front wall (5) so as to define the bottom of the 

opening (8) and so as to extend upwardly and 
rearwardly into or toward the recess (20) to terminate 

at a level substantially above the centre of a roll of 
film or wrap (7) located within the recess.
