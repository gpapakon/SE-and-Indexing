<ABSTRACT>
In order to make the bulging out deformation of the printing drum 
of a rotary stencil printer having a flexible cylindrical body by the 

internal press roller to be more easy and more uniform over the entire 
width of the printing, a flexible perforated sheet (20) forming the 

flexible cylindrical body of the printing drum is beforehand constructed 
to be a cylindrical body with its opposite annular edge portions being 

laid over a pair of annular portions (10a, 10b) connected with one 
another by a transverse bar portion (12), wherein the internal 

circumferential length of the cylindrical body made of the flexible 
perforated sheet is larger than the outer circumferential length of the 

annular portions as much as a determinate amount for allowing a part 
of the flexible cylindrical body to bulge radially outwardly, and the 

flexible cylindrical body is latched at a portion thereof laid one over 
the other with the transverse bar portion against relative 

circumferential movement while relatively movable in the radial 
direction within a determinate range against the transverse bar portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary stencil printer, and more
particularly to the construction of a printing drum thereof.In order for a rotary stencil printer to quickly start up to operate
normally after the start thereof such that high quality prints are
available from the first or second print with almost no trial printing,
and in view of the matter that, in a rotary stencil printer wherein each
printing paper is pressed between a printing drum and a back press
roller for each printing, while the printing drum and the back press
roller must be retracted from one another at each interval between two
successive supplies of printing sheets, either the printing drum or the
back press roller each having a substantial mass must inevitably be
frequently reciprocated, thereby substantially restricting an increase of
printing speed, it has been proposed in Japanese Patent Application 63-28553
(Laid-open Publication 1-204781) by the same assignee as that of
the present application to construct a rotary stencil printer such that a
principal portion of the printing drum extending between opposite axial
ends thereof to support a stencil sheet wrapped therearound is
constructed by a flexible perforated sheet, instead of the conventional
printing drum entirely made of a rigid cylindrical body, whereby a part
of the cylindrical body is bulged radially outwardly by an internal press
roller adapted to rotate along the inner surface of the cylindrical body,
such that, according to a rotation of the printing drum in the printing
operation, each portion of the flexible cylindrical body opposing the
back press roller is successively bulged out by the internal press
roller so as to apply a stencil printing to a printing sheet pressed
between the bulged out portion of the flexible cylindrical body and the
back press roller. Further, as an improvement of such a rotary
stencil printer, it has also been proposed in Japanese Patent Application
1-47029 (Laid-open Publication 2-225078) by the same assignee as that
of the present application to construct a printing drum such that the 
above-mentioned flexible cylindrical body is provided by a flexible
perforated sheet having a rectangular configuration in development, said
flexible perforated sheet being mounted around two annular portions
forming opposite axial end portions of the printing drum with opposite
side edge portions thereof being slidably seated on the outer
circumferential surfaces of the two annular portions.When the above-mentioned flexible perforated sheet
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A printing drum of a rotary type stencil printer in which said
printing drum (1) has a cylindrical body of a perforated construction

adapted for carrying a perforated stencil sheet wrapped therearound,
and ink supplied to the inside of said cylindrical body is supplied to

said stencil sheet through perforations of said cylindrical body due to
urging by an internal press roller (3) adapted to rotate along an

internal surface of said cylindrical body, wherein a part of said
cylindrical body is bulged radially outwardly by said internal press

roller as much as a predetermined substantial bulge out amount, while
said printing drum rotates with a print sheet (8) being pressed against

said cylindrical body thereof by a back press means (2) such that a
stencil printing is applied onto the printing sheet, said printing drum

having a frame body including two annular portions (10a, 10b) forming
opposite end portions thereof and a transverse bar portion (12)

connecting said two annular portions with one another and equipped with
a stencil sheet leading end mounting means (14) for selectively

mounting a leading end of a stencil sheet, and a flexible perforated
sheet (20) of a rectangular configuration in development with opposite

side edge portions thereof (20a, 20b) being adapted to freely seat on
outer circumferential surfaces of said two annular portions thus

constructing said cylindrical body, characterized in that said flexible
perforated sheet (20) is constructed to be a cylindrical body having an

inner circumferential length larger than the circumferential length of
said outer circumferential surfaces of said annular portions (10a, 10b)

as much as an amount which allows for the bulging out thereof of said
predetermined amount by said internal press roller (3).
A printing drum according to claim 1, wherein said transverse bar
portion (12) is shifted radially outwardly from a cylindrical surface

enveloping the outer circumferential surfaces of said two annular
portions (10a, 10b).
