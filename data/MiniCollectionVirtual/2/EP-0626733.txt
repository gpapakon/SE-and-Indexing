<ABSTRACT>
Method for connecting a metallic connection on to an electrode whose core has a fibrous or spongy (foam) structure, for an electrochemical generator, and electrode obtained, according to which method at least one metallic strip is applied on to an edge of the said core and compression-welding is carried out, which method is characterised in that, at least in line with the welding region between the said strip (24) and the so-called main core (22), a holding core (27) which is similar in nature to the main core is arranged prior to welding.

core having a fiber or foam-type structure for an electrochemical cell,

in which method at least one metal strip is pressed against one edge of
said core and said strip and said "main core" are welded together under

compression, said method being characterized by the fact that, prior to
the welding, an additional part referred to as a "retaining core" of a

type analogous to that of said main core is disposed at least in
register with the welding region.
