<ABSTRACT>
An imaging system includes a method and apparatus for use in processing fish 
body sections that have been transversely cut. The system uses a frame with a pair of 

shrouds (14,15), each having an interior space that contains an 
illumination system for 

illuminating the fish section. A pair of video cameras (48,49) housed 
respectively within the 

shrouds scan opposed flat sides (26,27) of the fish section to produce 
images of the 

respective sides. Screens (29,30) move behind the fish section in 
sequential 

fashion as each 
camera scans the fish section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fish processing and more particularly to a improved 
method and apparatus for processing a fish body that has been cut into a plurality of 
transverse fish body sections, and more particularly relates to an improved imaging apparatus 
that features imaging of both sides of a transverse fish slab section using automated 
illumination and background screening to produce an improved image of each of the 
opposed sides of a fish body section.  
 In the processing of fish such as tuna, it is common to freeze a catch of fish at sea, and 
to process the catch on shore. The processing normally involves thawing the fish followed 
by manual operations of slicing the fish belly and the removal of viscera. The visceral cavity 
is then washed with water, and the tuna inspected for spoilage. The tuna is then usually 
cooked whole in a batch type precooking operation. Manual prior art methods of processing tuna are described in greater detail in U.S. 
Patent 3,594,191 issued to J.M. Lapeyre. The '191 Lapeyre patent discloses the concept of 
cutting the tuna in lateral sections at spaced intervals and thereafter separating the edible loin 
portions to provide discrete cannable portions. A later U.S. Patent 3,593,370 entitled "Method of Butchering Tuna" issued to J.M. 
Lapeyre, describes a method for processing such transverse tuna sections while frozen. The 
method of butchering frozen tuna described in the '370 Lapeyre patent includes the 
subdivision of the whole fish into a plurality of transverse cross-sections 
and subsequently 
subdividing the cross-sections into frozen segments. The junctures between the segments are 
along lines generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fish and to the backbone thereof 
Each lateral fish section is skinned and the skinned sections operated on to effect a 
separation of the scrap parts of the segments from the loin meat parts, while the latter were 
still in at least a partially frozen condition. U.S. Patent 3,800,363 issued to J.M. Lapeyre entitled "Tuna Butchering Method and 
System" describes an automated butchering method and system for separating the edible loin  
 
portions of transverse tuna slices provided by subdivision of a frozen whole tuna. Three additional, more recently issued U.S. Patents include U.S. Patent No. 
4,748,724, entitled "Support Apparatus For Use In Video Imaging And Processing 
Of Transverse Fish Sections," U.S. Patent No. Re. 33,917, entitled "Support 
Apparatus For Use In Video Imaging And Processing Of

<CLAIMS>
A video imaging apparatus for use in processing transversely cut fish slab 
sections having an edible portion and a non-edible portion, the section including a 

pair of opposed flat surfaces surrounded by a curved peripheral portion, characterised in that it comprises: 

a) a frame (11); 
b) a video camera (48, 49, 108, 109) at each end of the frame; 
c) a target area adapted to receive the fish section; 
d) a holder (21, 64) for removably supporting a fish section to be processed in 
a position that enables one of the cameras to view one flat side of the fish section and 

the other camera to view the other side of the fish section. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the frame includes a pair of shrouds (14, 15, 102, 103) 
that surround the video cameras. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the holder (21, 64) forms a connection with the 
fish body section at the peripheral portion. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the target area is positioned generally 
between the cameras (48, 49, 108, 109) and equidistant to each camera so that the image generated by 

each camera is about the same size as the other generated image. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the frame (11) includes shroud means (14, 15, 102, 103) 
aligned with the cameras along a longitudinal axis that defines the line of sight 

between each camera and the fish section to be processed. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the frame includes a pair of shrouds (14, 15, 102, 103) 
that are generally opposed and that are aligned with the cameras respectively, and  

 
each shroud has a longitudinal axis that defines a line of sight between the cameras 

and the fish section to be processed. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein there is further provided background 
means for screening (29, 30, 65, 66) behind the fish body section during imaging. 
The apparatus of Claim 7 wherein the background means comprises a 
pair of background sheets (29, 30, 65, 66) that are movably affixed to the frame so that a selected one 

of the sheets can be placed behind the fish section surface to be viewed. 
The apparatus of Claim 1, further comprising positioning means for 
moving the holder (21, 64) supporting the fish section to be processed into the position in the 

target area that enables one of the cameras to view one flat surface and the other 
camera to view the other flat surface of the fish section.
