<ABSTRACT>
The present invention makes it possible to 
obtain good characteristics of forming sprays of fuel 

jetted through a plurality of injection ports of a fuel 
injection valve with respect to separation of sprays in 

different directions, atomization, jetting angles and 
penetrating force. 
Fuel jetted through the injection ports of the 
fuel injection valve is jetted in separate jets from a 

plurality of fuel flow separating holes (32, 33) of a 
sleeve nozzle (30). On the other hand, band-like assist 

air flows are jetted in a two-dimensional manner from 
slit-like air holes (62, 63) opened on the opposite sides 

of the fuel flow separating holes (32, 33) to impinge 
obliquely against the jetted fuel. Atomization of fuel 

jetted through the plurality of fuel flow separating 
holes (32, 33) is thereby promoted and fuel sprays are 

accurately separated and supplied independently in two 
directions toward two intake valves while the directions 

of jets from the injection ports of the fuel injection 
valve are maintained, thus injecting and supplying fuel. 

As a result, an amount of fuel impinging directly against 
walls which separates and forms two intake ports is 

reduced and an amount of atomized sprayed fuel directly 
entering a combustion chamber from the intake ports is 

therefore increased, thereby improving combustion 
characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel supply system
for an internal combustion engine according to the preamble of the patent claim 1.A fuel supply system is known in which a fuel
injection valve is provided in an intake pipe on the
upstream side of an intake port of an internal combustion
engine, and an air-fuel mixture in which a fuel from the
fuel injection valve and air are preliminarily mixed is
supplied to the engine. Pulverization or atomization of
the injected fuel and the atomized state of the fuel are
controlled so as to improve combustion characteristics.If a combustion chamber is provided with two
intake valves for the purpose of achieving high-speed and
high-power performance of an internal combustion engine,
it is necessary to evenly distribute fuel from a fuel
injection valve in the vicinity of an intake port to the
two intake valves. To achieve this effect, a fuel
injection valve has been proposed which is designed so as
to form bundles of fuel spray by separating fuel flow in 
two directions from the fuel injection valve (Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication No. 4-50472). In this
case, fuel is jetted from two injection holes so that two
fuel flows are evenly directed toward the two intake
valves. Simultaneously, air and fuel are caused to
impinge against and mix with each other so that injected
fuel is finely pulverized.For example, in the case where, as shown in
Fig. 3, fuel is to be jetted from a fuel injection valve
1 toward two intake valves 101 and 102 of a combustion
chamber, fuel pulverization/atomization characteristics
cannot be improved sufficiently, although fuel jetted
from the injection holes can be separated into two flows.The inventors of the present invention has
experimentally found the following fact. If a main air
hole is provided at a position between two injection
holes for separating a fuel spray in the fuel injection
system disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No.4-50472, it is necessary to supply air
through the main air hole at a very high flow rate in
order to separate a fuel spray in two directions. For
example, fuel jets from the two injection holes cannot be
separated suitably unless the area of a sub air hole is
made smaller than that of the main hole so that the area
ratio (main air hole area)/(sub air hole area) is about
6. with respect to non-supercharging introduction of air
from the upstream side of an intake throttle valve to a 
fuel injection valve in an internal combustion engine,
there is a limit to the maximum air flow rate in view of
