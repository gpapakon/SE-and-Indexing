<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new generation of electronic
microcircuit technology, having dimensions much smaller than those of
semiconductor integrated circuits, and to a related process of manufacturingTo better explain the significance and advantages of these innovations,
the following paragraphs (down to page 10) will review some technological
context. This technological context is not necessarily prior art, but is
intended to help in pointing out the disclosed inventions.Since about 1960, the steady downscaling of integrated circuit
minimum dimensions has permitted ever-increasing density, and thus an
ever-increasing range of functionality at an ever-more favorable cost. This
wealth of opportunity has permitted system designers to introduce many of
the electronic products which have revolutionized industry and daily life in
these decades. Continued downscaling steadily improves the available 
functionalities and pricing, and thus steadily challenges system designers.
This fosters a continuing climate of active innovation and competition.The most obvious index of downscaling is the steady reduction in the
"minimum geometry" which can be specified for fabrication of an integrated
circuit. This corresponds to a reduction in the size and spacing of the
individual transistors, and thus steadily increases the number of transistors
which can be fabricated in a given area. However, it is important to note
that scaling has also provided exponential improvements in device speed and
power dissipation, which has led to substantial enhancement of system
performance. Thus, an end to the epoch of downscaling would drastically
reduce the speed of progress in electronics.The danger now in sight is that the downscaling of minimum
geometries of transistor-based integrated circuits will eventually be brought
to an end by a combination of problems related to devices, interconnections,
noise, and reliability.1 The resulting saturation of circuit densities almost
certainly implies a saturation of the historical exponentially downward trend
in cost and volume per bit or function.Several constraints are visibly converging to cut off the advantages of
further scaling. While it is likely that clever process modifications can
postpone the impact of some constraints, it does not seem likely that all can
be avoided. One of the basic problems is alignment tolerances: formation of
features at a small minimum size λ does not imply that that minimum size
can be used for fabrication of working circuits: it is also necessary to
