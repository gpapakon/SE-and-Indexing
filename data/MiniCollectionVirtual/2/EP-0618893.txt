<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to energetic binders, and, more specifically, a class of nitramine-containing polyether polymers characterized by favorable viscosity and glass transition temperature, as well as resistance to hydrolysis are prepared. The invention also claims a process for producing a polymer containing nitramine- and/or nitro- and/or fluoro-groups which comprises reacting at least one nitramine-containing diacid chloride monomer with at least one nitro- or fluoro-containing diol monomer in an anhydrous organic solvent (preferably tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile, or diethylether, although other organic solvents can be employed such as pentane, hexane, heptane, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, toluene, benzene, and the like) in the presence of a tertiary amine base at a reaction temperature of between about 0  DEG C and about 50  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
•ENERGETIC POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOFThis invention relates generally to energetic binders, and, more specifically, to a class of nitramine-containing polymers characterized by enhanced energy, as well as favorable viscosity, glass transition 5 temperature, and resistance to hydrolysis.The demand by the military community for low signature propellents has resulted in the change from ammonium perchlorate to ammonium nitrate as the oxidizer of choice in the production of tactical rocket motors. 10 Unfortunately, however, this change has resulted in a reduction in the performance of the rockets, as measured by the specific impulse (ISD) of the rocket motors.Various nitropolymers have been fabricated in the past for application in solid, smokeless propellants. 15 For example. Aerojet General published a report. No 1162, dated September 28, 1956, entitled "Research in Nitropolymers and Their Application to Solid Smokeless Propellarts". This report documents various polymer:' - tion reactions useful in making nitropo•

 ., . ΛC.. 3i- vari \ - -' rε cJ. litramir.o diaciS**; --■- polymers, however, generally have a higher molecular weight than might be desired and do not possess carefully controlled, reactive, functional end groups as would be desirable. 25 Hercules Incorporated investigated a specific nitramine-containing polymer, ρoly(diethylene glycol-4,7- nitrazadecanedioate) designated as P-DEND. In a report entitled "High Performance Minimum Smoke 

 Propellants", Technical Report CR-RD-PR-86-4, dated May, 1986. Hercules documents work performed for the U.S. Army Missile Command wherein P-DEND is described as being a feasible ingredient for use in nitrate ester-plasticide propellants. This report states that attempts to fabricate P-DEND by an acid catalyzed esterification reaction of 4,7-dinitrazadecanedioic acid (DNDA) with diethylene glycol in a variety of organic solvents were unsuccessful. This failure is attributed in the report to the fact that a cyclization reaction rather than a polymerization reaction occurred. More recently, it has been found that P-DEND has a viscosity and a glass transition temperature that are higher than might be desired. There is a need by the military community for high energy binders which are safer and less expensive to manufacture and still afford a good combination of high impetus, low glass transition temperature, and low viscosity. One such way is to prepare energetic poly esters by condensing monomers of energetic diacids or diesters with monomers
