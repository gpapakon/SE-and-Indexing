<ABSTRACT>
A device for deburring edges (1', 1'') of a plate (1), in particular a metal plate, has a rotating tool (18) which, with two machining edges provided in the area of its outer periphery and facing one another, encloses two edges running essentially parallel to one another and can be brought into contact with these edges, of which a first edge is formed on a bottom surface and a second edge is formed on a top surface of the plate. In addition, the device has at least one bearing surface for positioning the tool with regard to the plate.
