<DESCRIPTION>
A method for making a lithographic printing plate 
that comprises of imagewise exposing a developer 
incorporated light sensitive material which consists of 
a support, and at least a negative working silver 
halide emulsion layer and a surface physical 
development nucleating layer on said support, and 
processing said construction in a silver complex 
diffusion transfer alkaline activator and/or developer 
containing anti-sludge agents. Said anti-sludge agents 
comprising an aminocarboxylic acid or an (α,β-enediol. This invention relates to a method of making a 
lithographic printing plate by the silver complex 
diffusion transfer process. In particular, this 
invention extends the life of the alkaline activator 
and/or developer solution by reducing the build-up of 
sludge due to the oxidation of eluted developers from 
the processed plate. Photographic precipitates in treatment solutions 
used in the process of developing silver halide images 
are well known and understood in the art. Typically 
the precipitates are due to hard water or silver salt 
deposition. US 4,310,613 teaches the benefit of 
quaternary ammonium salts over mercapto-heterocyclic 
compounds to reduce colored silver sludge in a 
diffusion transfer process. However, with aminophenol  
 
or dihydroxybenzene containing silver halide printing 
plates processed in a diffusion transfer alkaline 
activator, a humic acid sludge is formed in developer 
or activator solutions which limits the useful life of 
the chemistry. Ascorbic acid is a well established anti-oxidant, 
though in photographic applications it is better known 
as a developer. T.H. James, The Theory of The 
Photographic Process, 4th. Ed., Macmillan Pub., 1977, 
p.303-304 provides several references of ascorbic acid 
reducing silver halide. EP 498,968 and 531,582 describe ecologically 
improved graphic arts developers for silver halide 
emulsions by replacing hydroquinone with at least 0.4 
molar ascorbic acid. WO 93/11456 also states that substituting 
hydroquinone with ascorbic acid in a rapid access non-diffusing 
silver halide system developer will reduce 
sludge build-up. The absence of hydroquinone accounts 
for the lack of sludge. As applied to diffusion transfer systems, U.S. 
3,730,716 discloses improved stability of developed 
silver in cine film by the use of α,β-enediols. U.S. 
3,549,364 prevents colored developer oxidation products 
in a diffusion transfer system by using large 
quantities of ascorbic acid as an alternative to 
conventional developers.
