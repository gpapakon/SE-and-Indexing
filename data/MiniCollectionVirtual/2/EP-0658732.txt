<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming an artificial snow layer (3) is 
disclosed. Water content is added to to atmosphere (7) 

above a floor by a humidifying device (13), or water mist 
is added to the atmosphere (7) by a water-mist supplying 

device. The water content or the water mist is frost-frozen 
by a refrigerating device (6) incorporated at the 

floor, thus forming on the floor an accumulated frost 
layer as an artificial snow layer (3). A method of 

maintaining the formed artificial snow layer (3) is also 
disclosed. After the formation of the artificial 

snow layer (3), an atmosphere refrigerating device (12) is 
stopped or reduced in its operation so as to release 

the maintenance of the atmosphere below the freezing 
point. Then, the refrigerating device of the floor (6) is 

operated to prevent melting of the formed artificial 
snow layer (3) so as to prevent coagulation of water 

content in said atmosphere (7) on a surface of the 
artificial snow layer (3) through humidity adjustment of 

the atmosphere by a humidity adjusting device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
forming and maintaining an artificial snow layer, and
more particularly a method of forming and maintaining
an artificial snow layer at e.g. an artificial snow
indoor skiing slope.Conventional methods of forming an artificial
snow layer will be described. According to a first
conventional method, indoor atmosphere present
immediately above a floor surface is refrigerated to
e.g. a low temperature ranging between - 6 and - 10
degrees in Celsius and then cold water is sprayed
through a spraying nozzle onto the floor with
compressed air. With this, through the adiabatic
expansion effect associated with the nozzle spraying
and the refrigeration of the indoor air, the sprayed 
water is frozen into fine ice particles. Then, as the
ice particles are accumulated on and spread over the
floor, an artificial snow layer comprised of ice
particles is formed on the floor surface.According to a second conventional method, water-absorbent
resin particles containing water are sprayed
over a floor surface and the layer of the sprayed
water-containing resin particles is frozen there by
means of a refrigerating means incorporated at the
floor. Then, this frozen layer is pulverized into
fine particles by a pulverizing machine, thereby to
form on the floor surface an artificial snow layer
comprising the layer of frozen water-absorbent resin
particles. This method is described, for instance, in
the PCT/AU85/00267.However, according to the first conventional
method, an enormous amount of energy is required for
maintaining the indoor atmosphere (the atmosphere can
be huge in volume in case of e.g. the indoor skiing
slope) at such low temperature ranging between - 6 and
- 10 degrees in Celsius regardless of the outdoor
temperature. The amount of energy required will be
significant in the summer season. Therefore, this
method suffers the problem of significant cost for the
formation of the artificial snow layer. Moreover, the 
maintenance costs will also be significant for
maintaining the indoor atmosphere at the low
temperature of - 2 to - 3 degrees in Celsius by
preventing the snow layer from being melted.In addition, since the indoor atmosphere is
maintained at such low temperature as described above
during the snow-layer forming operation and also
during the actual use of the formed snow layer, the
user of the slope, i.e. a skier, or a worker tends to
feel uncomfortably cold or even feel dizzy due to a
thermal shock from the drastic change in the
temperature between the extremely

A method of forming and maintaining an artificial snow layer in
an indoor atmosphere, the method comprising the steps of:


(a) maintaining the temperature of said indoor
atmosphere above a floor surface (2) below the freezing point

of water by an atmosphere refrigerating means (10);
(b) forming said artificial snow layer (3) by
spraying water into said indoor atmosphere and causing said

water to freeze and accumulate as ice particles on said
floor surface (2);
(c) after step (b), reducing the work of said
atmosphere refrigerating means (10) to no longer maintain

the temperature of the indoor atmosphere below the freezing
point of water;
(d) operating a floor refrigerating means (6)
incorporated at said floor surface (2) to prevent melting

of the formed artificial snow layer (3); and
(e) controlling the humidity of said indoor
atmosphere by adjusting a humidity adjusting means (12) to

maintain the water vapor pressure of said indoor atmosphere
at a value substantially equal to the water vapor pressure

at the surface of said artificial snow layer (3) and to
prevent water in said indoor atmosphere from coagulating on

said surface of said artificial snow layer (3).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the indoor
atmosphere above the floor surface (2) is maintained below

the freezing point of water during step (a) by circulating
a refrigerating medium to a refrigerating coil (10a) of

said atmosphere refrigerating means (10) by means of a
cooling device (4).
A method according to claim 1, wherein said
humidity adjusting means (12) comprises a dehumidifier.
