<ABSTRACT>
Method for making a porous membrane with a symmetrical structure which is gastight when saturated with electrolyte and whereby, according to this method, a solution is made from an organic binding agent in a solvent and the solvent is removed by means of extraction through immersion in an organic non-solvent, characterized in that an amount of metal oxide and/or metal hydroxide is added to the solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for making a porous 
membrane, according to which method a suspension is made 
from a solution of an organic binding agent in a solvent 
and an amount of metal oxide and/or metal hydroxide, the 
suspension is brought into the desired shape by providing 
it on a support or by shaping techniques such as extrusion 
of spinning, and the solvent is removed by means of 
extraction through immersion in a non-solvent, this is a 
liquid which is not a solvent for the binding agent and the 
metal oxide and/or metal hydroxide. A metal of this kind is disclosed in EP-A-0 241 995. 
According to this method a filtration membrane is prepared 
by dissolving a polysulfone in a solvent and adding 
zirconium oxide. The mixture is cast and the solvent is 
removed by submerging the mixture in a water bath and 
subsequently in a bath containing a boiling mixture of 
glycerine and water. By removing the solvent by means of water, an asymetrical 
structure with finger-like pores is obtained. This 
structure seems to be the consequence of the speed at which 
the solvent is removed by the water. Such finger-like pores 
are excellent for filtration membranes. It is clear that with asymmetric membranes with finger-like 
pores, the gas tightness when saturated with electrolyte is 
not always guaranteed. With the useable thicknesses of the 
membranes in for example electrochemical cells, one or more 
pores can extend crosswise through the membrane. Also when 
welding, the membranes in for example an electrochemical  
 
cell structure or when the surface is damaged, gas leaks 
may occur in membranes made according to above mentioned 
known method whith water as non-solvent. The invention aims to remedy said disadvantage and to 
provide a method for making a memrane of the type mentioned 
in the first paragraph, but according to which a 
symmetrical membrane can be obtained which does not only 
have the required pore structure but also the required 
conductivity and gastightness when saturated with 
electrolyte, such that the membrane can be used in 
electrochemical cells. To this aim, an organic non-solvent is used instead of 
water to extract the solvent. By using an organic non-solvent instead of water, another 
symmetrical porous structure is obtained. The obtained 
membrane can be used a separator in an electrochemical cell. The influence of the non-solvent on the structure is known 
as such but in ultrafiltration membranes comprising no 
metal oxide. This influence is described amongst others in
