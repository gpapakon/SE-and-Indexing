<ABSTRACT>
A feeder box for the feed and/or storage of bulk material, especially clay, possesses a housing (1), designated as a charging box, with two longitudinal side walls (1a and 1b), a rear end wall (1c) and a discharge orifice (1d) in the front region. The bottom is formed from transversely extending slats (3) driven longitudinally movably, these being arranged as a rotating strand and being guided back in the opposite direction via deflecting members underneath the upper strand (3a) forming the bottom. The drive takes place by means of at least one intermittently working thrust-generating drive unit (6'; 6; 7) engaging on the upper strand (3a). The deflecting members are non-driven deflecting regions. Such a drive makes it possible to construct feeder boxes virtually without any size limitation.

<CLAIMS>
A box feeder for the loading with and/or the storing
of clay, with a housing (1) open at the top, which has two

longitudinal side walls (1a and 1b) and a rear end wall
(1c) and in the front area a discharge opening (1d) for

the bulk material (12) as well as a longitudinally
moveable floor made from lamellae (3) extending crosswise

to below the longitudinal side walls, whereby the lamellae
(3) are positioned as a circulating strand and are passed

back below the top run (3a) forming the floor in the
opposite direction via deflecting instruments,

characterised in that

the drive is formed through at least one drive unit
producing thrust and touching on the top run (3a), and the

deflecting instruments are non-driven deflecting areas,
whereby the drive 
unit has a piston-cylinder unit (6, 7)
working in a stroke-wise way, which touches on drive rods

(8, 9, 10, 11), which carry carriers (8a, 9a, 10a, 11a)
which during the forward stroke engage in a shape-locking

way with the lamellae (3) or lamellae holders, and during
the backward stroke disengage, whereby the drive rods are

positioned parallel to the floor and below the same.
A box feeder according to Claim 1

characterised in that

at least two piston-cylinder units are provided which work
in a contra-rotating way.
A box feeder according to Claim 1 or 2

characterised in that

the piston-cylinder units (6, 7) are hydraulic piston-cylinder
units. 
A box feeder according to one of the Claims 1 to 3

characterised in that

the deflecting areas are formed in a stationary way.
A box feeder according to Claim 4

characterised in that

the deflecting areas are semi-circular deflecting
segments.
A box feeder according to one of the Claims 1 to 5

characterised in that

a piston-cylinder unit (6, 7) touches on a pair of drive
rods (8, 9, 10, 11) which are parallel to one another.
A box feeder according to Claim 6

characterised in that

a pair of drive rods (8, 9, 10, 11) is allocated to each
of the contra-rotating piston-cylinder units (6, 7)

respectively, whereby all drive rods run parallel to one
another.
A box feeder according to one of the Claims 1 to 7

characterised in that

the lamellae (3) cover themselves in an imbricated way on
their longitudinal sides.
A box feeder according to one of the Claims 1 to 8

characterised in that

in the area of the discharge opening (1d) there is a
paddle wheel (2).
