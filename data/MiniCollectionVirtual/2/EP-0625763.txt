<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to signal couplers. Conventionally, signal couplers are used in demountable electronic devices 
such as smart cards. Smart cards are credit card size devices containing an 
integrated circuit, and in use are arranged to communicate to a base device 
through a signal coupler which provides an electrical connection for the flow 
of supply current and/or data signals between the base device and the 
integrated circuit of the smart card. A problem with this arrangement is that in normal use, the contacts may 
become worn, thereby not efficiently transmitting the power supply or the 
data signals between the base device and the demountable device. 
Functionality of the circuit within the device may thereby be impaired or 
lost. It is known to use an inductive connection composed of two inductive coils 
which do not require physical contact. However, very close proximity 
between the two coils is necessary for good functionality with this 
arrangement. Furthermore, the coil of the device cannot easily be integrated with the 
circuit thereof, thereby placing a constraint on the minimum size of the 
device and convenience of manufacture. This invention seeks to provide a signal coupler in which the above 
mentioned disadvantages have been mitigated.  It is an object of the present invention to provide a signal coupler for 
incorporating in a predetermined one of a demountable device and a base 
device, comprising an optocoupling arrangement for exchanging optical 
signals between the demountable device and the base device, the two devices 
being in proximity to each other. The optocoupling arrangement provides a non-contact conductive path 
between the demountable device and the base device. The optocoupling arrangement may comprise at least one photovoltaic 
generator. To advantage, when incorporated in the demountable device, the at least one 
photovoltaic generator may be fabricated by epitaxial growth from a 
semiconductor wafer incorporated in the demountable device. The signal coupler may be arranged to transfer data or power signals 
through the conductive path between the demountable device and the base 
device. Alternatively, the signal coupler may be arranged to transfer a combined 
data and power signal through the conductive path between the 
demountable device and the base device. Further, the demountable device may be a smartcard. In this way, the wearing of metal contacts is avoided and functionality of a 
circuit within the demountable device is preserved whilst
