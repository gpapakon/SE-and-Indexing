<ABSTRACT>
A device is specified for the connection of an explosive charge, which can be triggered by electrical current, to a current source, in the case of which device a two-wire electrical cable is connected to the explosive charge. A plug (4) having two plug pins (7, 8) which run parallel to one another and onto which a mating plug is plugged when the device is in the closed position is fitted on that end of the cable facing away from the explosive charge. A short-circuiting element (11) is fitted in the region between the two plug pins (7, 8). This short-circuiting element (11) consists of resilient metal and is arranged such that it can move in the plug (4) in the direction of the axis of the plug pins (7, 8), between a defined rest position and an operating position. In its rest position, which is predetermined by its own shape and spring force and corresponds to the device being in the open position, the short-circuiting element (11) projects into the space which is provided for mating the plug when the device is in the closed position, making contact with both plug pins (7, 8), by a distance which is shorter than the length of the plug pins (7, 8). In its operating position, it is arranged in a recess (14) in the plug (4), making contact on the end surface of the mating plug, which is located in the closed position of the device, without touching the plug pins (7, 8).

An electric plug connector with a short-circuiting
element (11) comprising a connector (4) having two

contact elements (7, 8) extending in parallel to one
another and a mating connector (5), wherein a two-wire

electric line (2) is connected to the contact elements
(7, 8) of the connector (4), wherein in an open

position the contact elements (7, 8) are free of the
mating connector (5), wherein the connector (4)

contains an outwardly open recess (14) for the
accommodation of the short-circuiting element (11)

which is composed of resilient metal and has two arms
extending approximately in a V-formation relative to

one another, the opening of said recess being situated
between the contact elements (7, 8), and wherein the

short-circuiting element (11) bears against the two
contact elements (7, 8) in its rest position

corresponding to the open position of the plug
connector, does not contact the contact elements (7,

8) in its operating position corresponding to the
closed position of the plug connector, and is arranged

in the connector (4) so as to be moveable in the
direction of the axis of the contact elements (7, 8)

between its rest position predetermined by its own
shape and spring force and its operating position,

characterised in that

in its rest position the stirrup-shaped short-circuiting
element (11) projects into the space

provided for the mating connector (5) in the
closed position of the plug connector by a

distance which is shorter than the length of the
contact elements (7, 8) formed by contact pins

projecting from the connector (4),
in its operating position the short-circuiting
element (11) is arranged in the connector (4) 

bearing against the end face (18) of the mating
connector (5) plugged onto the connector (4) and
in the region of its opening the recess (14) of
the connector (4) is widened conically outwards

by sloping surfaces (15, 16) serving as bearing
surfaces for the short-circuiting element (11).
A plug connector according to Claim 1, characterised
in that at its two free ends the stirrup-shaped short-circuiting

element (11) in each case comprises an
outwardly directed deflection (12, 13) bent in an

approximately semi-circular formation.
A plug connector according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that a stop means (17) for limiting

the movement of the short-circuiting element (11) is
arranged in the recess (14).
A plug connector according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that at least those surfaces of the

short-circuiting element (11) which bear against the
contact elements (7, 8) in its rest position are gold-plated.
