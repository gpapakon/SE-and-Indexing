<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to adhesives for 
bonding polyolefin film, polyolefin film employing this 
adhesive and methods for applying the polyolefin film 
with adhesive to containers. Polyvinyl chloride is currently employed 
for shrink wrap films. However, use of polyvinyl 
chloride is diminishing due to actual or perceived 
environmental concerns. Thus, it would be desirable to 
find a substitute for polyvinyl chloride. Polyolefins 
such as polypropylene or polyethylene would be desirable 
alternatives but they are difficult to bond. 
Polypropylene is particularly difficult to bond because 
it has a low surface energy (i.e. 27 dynes/cm.). Tensile 
shear during heat shrinking of polypropylene causes 
overlapping film ends to separate from one another. This 
is particularly a problem in commercial use because ovens 
used to heat shrink the polypropylene film about a 
product typically have varying temperatures at different 
parts of the oven. Thus, the adhesive has to withstand 
local hot spots of typically 230-250Â°F. In shrink wrap 
applications, where a label is attached to a container  
 
and then the container is spun such that the label wraps 
around the container, an adhesive needs to be able to 
stick on contact because typical commercial units wrap 
from 100 up to more than 1000 containers per minute. There are basically three ways to apply a label 
to a container: wrap, mandrel and sleeve. Wrap methods are disclosed by U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,844,760; 4,781,785; 4,694,633; 4,544,431; and 4,574,020 
incorporated herein by reference. In the wrap method, 
the label is attached to the container and then the 
container is spun to wrap the label about the container. 
The label is then heat shrunk if necessary. Mandrel methods are disclosed by U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,496,409 and 4,366,016 incorporated herein by 
reference. In the mandrel method the label is wrapped 
about a mandrel and then drops off the mandrel to 
surround a container. The label is then heat shrunk to 
snugly fit the container. Sleeve methods are disclosed by U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,454,181; 4,562,684; and 4,806,187 incorporated 
herein by reference. By this method, a sleeve is cut 
from a pre-formed roll of flat tubular film. The sleeve 
is placed about the container and then heat shrunk to 
snugly fit the container. Elastomeric polyurethanes are known adhesives. 
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,001,971 and 2,871,218 disclose some 
polyurethanes. Polyurethanes may include additives. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,301,053 discloses an aqueous carboxyl 
functional
