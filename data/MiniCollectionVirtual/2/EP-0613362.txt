<ABSTRACT>
A disposable article, e.g. a diaper, having a backing layer (5) formed of soluble material constructed so that when in contact with a relatively large volume of liquid, e.g. that produced by flushing a lavatory, the backing layer (5) dissolves and loses its integrity but when in contact with a relatively small volume of liquid, e.g. when handled with wet hands, dissolution is restricted so that the backing layer (5) maintains its integrity. The backing layer may have variable solubility across its thickness, e.g. one side of the backing layer may comprise a relatively soluble material (4), whereas the other side comprises a less soluble material (6). Alternatively, the backing layer may comprise a soluble membrane (5) having a discontinuous layer (14, 16) of relatively insoluble material applied to at least one surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disposable articles and more particularly to
disposable composite structures such as nappies (diapers), feminine
hygiene products, and incontinence products.The increasing demand for disposable products is producing an
escalating problem of waste build up which contaminates the natural
environment.One of the major contributors to this build up of waste is in the
domain of absorbent products. It is well known that current
technologies fall short in providing materials which obviate the
problem.Consideration of current structures used to produce disposable
absorbent products, especially those which absorb body fluids, reveal
that they represent a health risk due to the difficulties of handling
and storage in the soiled state. Attempts have been made to re-cycle
such products through collection and eventual processing but any
system which requires mass storage prior to re-cycling will, almost by
definition, increase the risk to health and is likely to be socially
unacceptable.Whilst feminine hygiene products are routinely flushed (after being
torn in half along their length prior to flushing), the materials
conventionally used in the manufacture of both nappies (hereinafter
called diapers) and adult incontinence products, make them incompatible
with the flushing process and the subsequent sewage cycle. Diapers
are, for example, usually provided with a polythene backing layer
which is both insoluble and does not biodegrade. An advance in this field is described in PCT patent specification
publication No WO-A-92/02199 (priority date 10 August 1990,
international filing date 9 August 1991 and publication date
20 February 1992). This describes a composite material for providing a
disposable product such as a diaper having an outer, soluble layer
supporting a liquid impervious barrier, exampled by a coating, which
separates the soluble layer from a disintegratable and dispersible liquid
absorbent layer. However, this construction suffers from the
disadvantage that although it is designed to maintain its integrity
during normal use, problems arise because the outer soluble layer can
dissolve if it inadvertently comes into contact with liquid. e.g. if it is
handled by a person having wet hands. This problem is acknowledged
in the final paragraph of WO-A-92/02199 which describes an insoluble
re-usable plastics outer cover (shown in Figure 15 thereof) in which
the disposable linings can be used. This cover obviously helps protect
the lining, and particularly the soluble outer layer

<CLAIMS>
An article which is disposable in water, the article comprising a
backing layer (5) which provides the article with mechanical

strength, the backing layer including a membrane (4, 6) formed
of material which is soluble in water such that when the article is

in contact with a relatively large volume of water, e.g. that
produced by a flushing lavatory, the membrane (4, 6) readily

dissolves to an extent that the backing layer (5) loses its
integrity and mechanical strength, wherein the outer surface of

the membrane (4, 6) is adapted so as to dissolve less readily than
the inner surface of the membrane (4, 6) whereby, when the

outer surface of the article is in contact with a relatively small
volume of water, e.g. when handled with wet hands, dissolution

of the membrane (4, 6) is restricted so that the backing layer (5)
maintains its integrity and mechanical strength.
An article as claimed in Claim 1 in which the membrane (4, 6) has
variable solubility across its thickness, the outer surface being

less soluble in water than the inner surface thereof.
An article as claimed in Claim 2 in which the membrane comprises
two layers, an inner layer (6) formed of a first material which is

relatively soluble in water, e.g. a cold water soluble material,
and an outer layer (4) formed of a second material which is less

soluble in water, e.g. a hot water soluble material.
An article as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3 in which the membrane
(4, 6) has a discontinuous layer (12, 14; 16; 56; 59) of insoluble

or relatively insoluble material applied to at least the outer
surface thereof which restricts dissolution of the membrane (4,

6).
An article as claimed in Claim 4 in which the discontinuous layer
(12, 14; 16; 56; 59) is applied to the said outer surface, at least

in the most vulnerable areas thereof, in a pattern which exposes
only discrete areas of the membrane (4, 6). 
An article as claimed in Claim 4 or 5 in which the discontinuous
layer (12, 14; 16; 56; 59) covers between 5% and 95% of the said

outer surface.
An article as claimed in Claim 6 in which the discontinuous layer
(12, 14; 15; 56' 59) is applied in a pattern which leaves areas of

the membrane (4, 6) exposed, e.g. in the form of bands or
squares, having a width of between 2mm and 30mm.
An article as claimed in any preceding claim comprising an
absorbent layer (34; 36) and a substantially impervious membrane

(19; 27) interposed between the absorbent layer (34; 36) and the
backing layer (5).
An article as claimed in Claim 8 in which the substantially
impervious membrane (19) comprises a fibrous web (18) having a

layer (20) of water resistant material applied to at least one
surface thereof.
An article as claimed in Claim 8 comprising a liner (44;
54) covering the absorbent layer (34; 36) on the opposite side to

the backing layer (5) to prevent the absorbent layer (34; 36)
coming into direct contact with a user.
An article as claimed in Claim 10 in which the liner (44; 54) is

attached to the backing layer (5) so that when the article is in
contact with a relatively large volume of water the liner (44; 54)

becomes detached from the backing layer (5) as the soluble
membrane (4, 6) dissolves and thus releases the absorbent layer

(34; 36) and the impervious membrane (19; 27).
An article as claimed in any preceding claim in the form of a
diaper.
