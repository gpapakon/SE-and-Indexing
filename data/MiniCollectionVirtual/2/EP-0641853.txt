<ABSTRACT>
Water-in-oil emulsions are broken by the use of 
adducts prepared by reacting high molecular weight 

polyalkylene glycol with ethylene oxide, or diglycidyl 
ether, or both ethylene oxide and diglycidyl ether. The 

adduct demulsifiers may be used alone or as a blend with 
other demulsifiers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of
demulsifying water-in-oil emulsions using polyalkylene glycol
derivatives. In one aspect, the method relates to the
demulsification of crude oil in water emulsion.In the production of oil from oil wells, the produced
fluids frequently include water in the form of free water or
emulsion. In order for the oil to be of pipeline quality, it
is necessary to reduce the water content to below a specified
amount (e.g. below 1.0%).A variety of mechanical, electrical, and chemical methods
are used in the dehydration of produced fluids. The present
invention relates specifically to the chemical treatment using
chemicals referred to as demulsifiers. A demulsifier is
defined as a single or a blend of surfactant compounds in a
suitable solvent system which is formulated to treat a particular
emulsion on an optimum cost/performance basis. The
method of the present invention employs demulsifiers for
treating water-in-oil emulsions, the most common type of
emulsions encountered in oil field-production. It specifically
excludes the treatment of oil-in-water type emulsions
(i.e. reverse emulsions).A variety of demulsifiers are known in the art, including
those derived from alcohols, fatty acids, fatty amines,
glycols, and alkylphenol formaldehyde condensation product. As noted above, the method of the present invention
involves the use of certain polyalkylene glycol derivatives,
specif-ically adducts of a high molecular weight polyalkylene
glycol and ethylene oxide and/or a diglycidyl ether.As illustrated by the following references, polyalkylene
glycol and its derivatives have been long used in the demulsification
of oils.
(a) U.S. Patent 4,374,734 discloses the use of polyoxypropylene
polyol (mw of 2,000 to 4,500) for the
breaking of water-in-oil emulsions wherein the
emulsion is produced by surfactant flooding.(b) U.S. Patent 3,835,060 teaches that conventional
demulsifiers include polyoxyalkylene glycol and
block polymers of polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene.(c) U.S. Patent 2,754,271 discloses treating agents
comprising an addition product of an alkylene oxide
with an aliphatic dihydric alcohol and further
describes the dihydric alcohol (polyoxypropylene
diols) are known to have molecular weights as high
as about 3,000.(d) U.S. Patent 3,557,017 discloses water-in-oil demulsifiers
comprising ultra high molecular weight (of
molecular weight at least 100,000) polymers. The
polymers are selected from a group that includes
polyoxyalkylene polymers and copolymers of monomeric
al
