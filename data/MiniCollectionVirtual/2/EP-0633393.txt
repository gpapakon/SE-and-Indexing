<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement for distribution of cooling liquid in the cooling 
liquid jacket in an internal combustion engine(2) with 

cylinders(8) disposed in line in the engine's cylinder block(4) 

or in a bank of cylinders of the engine. The liquid jacket 
includes a liquid inlet chamber(10) at one end(12) of the row 

of cylinders and a liquid outlet chamber(14) at the same end 
(12) or at the opposite end(16) of the row of cylinders and, in 

the cylinder block or bank of cylinders with associated 
cylinder head(4), mutually interconnected cooling liquid spaces 

(18,20,22) and ducts(24,26) which communicate with those 
chambers. In the lower portion of the cooling jacket a liquid 

distribution pipe(44) running along the row of cylinders is 
inserted at one side of the row of cylinders and has at one end 

a liquid inlet(46) which communicates with the liquid inlet 
chamber(10). In the wall of the distribution pipe(44) there 

are liquid outlet holes(50,52-62) which are distributed along 
the distribution pipe and are so placed and directed in the 

distribution pipe wall as to direct cooling water flows(S) 
towards the cylinder tops and/or the spaces between them. 

These liquid outlet holes(50,52-62) in the wall of the 
distribution pipe(44) have successively increasing diameters as 

from the end of the row of cylinders where the liquid outlet 
chamber is situated. The outlet holes are preferably directed 

obliquely upwards towards the roof of the cooling jacket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an arrangement of the kind 
indicated in the introduction to claim 1 for the distribution 
of cooling liquid in the cooling jacket of an internal 
combustion engine (see US-A-1822857). Such an arrangement is applicable in engines in which the 
cylinders are disposed in line in the cylinder block (in the 
case of an in-line engine) or in each bank or row of cylinders 
(in the case of a vee-engine). In either case the cooling 
jacket includes a cooling liquid inlet chamber and a cooling 
liquid outlet chamber at the ends of the rows of cylinders, and 
the cylinder block/bank of cylinders with associated cylinder 
head contains mutually interconnected cooling liquid spaces and 
ducts which communicate with both chambers. An internal combustion engine converts approximately only one-fourth 
of the heat evolved into useful work. The remaining heat 
has to be led away to prevent engine overheating. When the 
engine is running at full capacity, the surplus heat is removed 
by the exhaust gas system, by internal friction, by lubricating 
oil becoming warm and by the cooling system. The heat led away 
by the cooling system may amount to 30-35% of the heat evolved 
by the engine. An effective cooling system (in the present case 
a liquid cooling system) is therefore absolutely necessary for 
an internal combustion engine to work properly. The heat evolved in an internal combustion engine is not 
evolved uniformly throughout the engine, since certain portions 
of the engine are particularly subjected to heat, namely the 
cylinder tops with the combustion chambers, exhaust gas ports 
and exhaust gas ducts, and the upper portions of the cylinder 
barrels. The portions of a liquid cooling system which are part of the 
engine have therefore to be so designed as to achieve  
 
particularly effective cooling for the aforesaid portions of 
the engine which are most subjected to heat. To this end, a 
plurality of design solutions have been developed which in 
different ways endeavour to achieve such "specially directed" 
effective cooling of certain portions of an internal combustion 
engine. For instance, there is a previously known solution whereby the 
engine cooling water inlet and outlet are placed at the same 
end of the engine and a cooling water pipe is inserted in the 
cooling jacket in order to lead all the cooling water supplied 
via the cooling water inlet towards the cylinder situated 
furthest from the inlet, thereby making all the cooling water 
pass all the cylinders before
