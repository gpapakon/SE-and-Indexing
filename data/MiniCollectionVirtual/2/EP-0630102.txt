<ABSTRACT>
A high gain differential amplifier including a 
differential transistor pair (M₁, M₂) having first and second 

transistors (M₁, M₂) whose gates are connected to first and 
second input terminals (t₁, t₂); a current mirror circuit 

wherein the drain of the transistor (M₁) is connected to an 
output terminal; a transistor (M₅) whose gate and drain are 

connected to the drain of transistor (M₁) and output terminal 
of the current mirror circuit, and to the output terminal (t₃) 

and the drain of transistor (M₂), respectively; a transistor 
(M₆) whose drain and gate are connected to an input terminal 

of the current mirror circuit, and to a bias power supply 
terminal, respectively; and constant-current source (I₁, I₂) 

which are connected to the common sources of differential 
transistor pair (M₁, M₂) and a source of the transistor (M₆), 

respectively. The addition of the sixth transistor (M₆) 
permits a voltage between the drain and source of the third 

and fourth transistors (M₃, M₄) to be nearly equal. As a 
result, a drain current ratio between the third and fourth 

transistors (M₃, M₄) can be precisely determined and thus an 
input offset voltage can be reduced to nearly zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a differential
amplifier having high gain at a low frequency signal input.Examples of prior art differential amplifiers with offset- compensation or offset voltage
control are known from US- A- 5 045 806 and US- A- 4 658 157, respectively.As a prior art on the present invention, one
differential amplifier has been proposed, as disclosed in the
published Japanese Patent Application JP-A-6-045 844.Fig. 1 shows a conventional typical differential
amplifier as disclosed in JP-A-6-045844. In this case, a pair of FETS (field-effect
transistors) M101 and M102 whose sources are coupled with
each other in common and whose gates are connected to
respective input terminals t1 and t2 constitute a
differential transistor pair. One end of a first constant-current
source I101 is coupled with the common source
connection point of the FETs M101 and M102 and the other end
of the first constant-current source I101 is connected to a
low power supply terminal t4. The drain and gate of an FET
M103 are coupled with each other and the source of the FET
M103 is connected to a high power supply terminal t5. The
gate of another FET M104 is connected to the gate of the FET
M103, and the source to the high power supply terminal t5, and
the drain to the drain of the FET M101. The FETs M103 and
M104 constitute a current mirror circuit. The gate of an FET
M105 is connected to the drains of the FETs M101 and M104, and
the source to the high power supply terminal t5, and the
drain to an output terminal t3 and to the drain of the FET
M102. One end of a second constant-current source I102 is 
coupled with the drain and gate of the FET M103 and the other
end to the low power supply terminal t4.Next, the operation of this differential amplifier
will now be described.First, the differential transistor pair composed of
the FETs M101 and M102 distributes the current of the first
constant-current source I101 depending on signal voltages
applied to the input terminals t1 and t2 to flow a drain
current. The current mirror circuit including the FETs M103
and M104 outputs a current which is fixed and equal to the
current value determined by the second constant-current source
I102 and hence the variation of the drain current of the FET
M101 is transferred to the gate of the FET M105.The variation of the drain current of the FET M101 is
amplified by the FET M105 and the amplified current is output
from the output terminal t3.On the other hand, the variation of the drain current
of the FET M102 turns to a value to
