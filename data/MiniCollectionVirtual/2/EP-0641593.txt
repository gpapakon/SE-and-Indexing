<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for breaking or separating a liquid mixture 
or emulsion having two or more components. The apparatus 

includes a closed vessel having one or more sequentially 
connected filtering compartments holding a filtering element 

such as a membrane assembly capable of achieving a multi-stage 
pervaporation to separate out a vaporous component of the 

solution. The apparatus further includes a bypass facility 
which interconnects adjacent filtering compartments. To 

compensate for the loss of heat energy during the vaporization 
segments, the residual liquid solution is bypassed into a 

second vaporization phase, the bypass facility including 
heating means for maintaining the residual solution of a 

predetermined liquid temperature prior to its entering the 
second or subsequent filtering phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
Processes for the separation of liquids or emulsions 
into components, have rapidly advanced through the development 
of more sophisticated techniques and equipment. In one of the 
more advanced practices, liquids, emulsions and solutions are 
separable into individual components with a high degree of 
purity when subjected to a pervaporation process prompted by 
the utilization of membrane separation techniques. To most effectively utilize this technology, it is 
found desirable and productively effective to maintain 
substantially uniform separating conditions throughout the 
process. Such control is deemed relevant in the instance of 
separations embodying pervaporation, particularly during 
consecutive steps or phases. It is known, for example, that by forcing the subject 
liquid or solution through consecutive membrane separation 
steps causing removal of the vaporized permeate, the residual 
liquid or liquid mixture can be substantially free of the 
permeate segment. It is, therefore, a primary object of the invention 
to provide an apparatus for the pervaporation of a solution or 
emulsion to achieve a high degree of accuracy and production 
efficiency in the removal of at least one of the vaporizable 
segments of the solution.  Toward achieving the object of the invention, there 
is presently provided a pervaporation vessel adapted for 
pervaporation of an organic aqueous liquid under preferred 
operating condition. The apparatus or vessel is comprised primarily of a 
closed casing into which inlet and discharge ports are formed 
and into which a barrier wall is positioned to define a 
plurality of, and at least two adjacent filtering compartments. A pervaporation element in the form of a membrane 
assembly is positioned in each filter compartment for 
contacting hot aqueous or organic fluid and vaporized permeate 
which passes through the respective compartments. The membrane 
assembly is structured to pass only the vaporized permeate and 
block the residual liquid. At least one bypass means external to the vessel 
receives residual liquid which is substantially free of the 
vaporized component. Heating means in said bypass means 
restores the liquid to its operating temperature prior to 
reintroducing it into an adjacent filter compartment for the 
next nanofiltration of the treatment. One method for utilizing the apparatus comprises the 
multi-stage processing of a liquid solution to separate a 
vaporizable component from the solution by
