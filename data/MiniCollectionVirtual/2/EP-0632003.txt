<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel phenol
compounds containing a methoxymethyl group or a hydroxymethyl
group.It has conventionally been known that hydroxymethyl-containing
phenol compounds are used in various applications.
For example, besides being applied to coating compositions as
described in "THE CHEMISTRY OF ORGANIC FILM FORMERS" written
by D.H. Solomon, hydroxymethyl-containing phenol compounds
are used in many fields such as, e.g., lithographic plates,
photoresists, adhesives, molding materials, laminating
materials, and binders.Frequently used in these applications are a phenol-formaldehyde-resol
resin or the compounds described in
Japanese patent publication (examined) No. Hei-1-49932,
specifically such compounds as bishydroxymethyl-p-cresol and
tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)bisphenol A.However, such conventionally known hydroxymethyl-containing
phenol compounds have been disadvantageous in that
methylol groups, which function as a crosslinking group,
cannot be incorporated in the molecule in a large number.
The phenol-formalin-resol resin also is disadvantageous in
that the number of the reactive hydroxymethyl groups 
contained in the molecule is small. Hence, both the
hydroxymethyl-containing phenol compounds and the phenol-formaldehyde-resol
resin have failed to attain sufficient
cured-film performances when used in coating compositions,
photosensitive printing plates, etc. It has therefore been
necessary that in order to meet cured-film performance
requirements, the hydroxymethyl-containing phenol compounds
or the resol resin should be incorporated in a large amount.Further, there has been another problem that the
incorporation of a hydroxymethyl group results in impaired
solvent solubility.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a methoxymethyl- or hydroxymethyl-containing phenol
compound which has sufficient cured-film performances even
when used in a smaller amount as compared with the
conventional hydroxymethyl-containing phenol compounds and
resol resin.The methoxymethyl- or hydroxymethyl-containing phenol
compound of the present invention is represented by the
following formula (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V): 

wherein
each R represents CH2OCH3, CH2OH, or H, provided that
at least three of the R's are CH2OCH3 or CH2OH, with at least
one thereof being CH2OCH3;each R1 represents CH2OCH3, CH2OH, or H, provided that
at least two of the R1's are CH2OH; andeach R2 represents CH2OCH3, CH2OH, or H, provided that
at least two of the R2's are CH2OH.In the formula (I), each R
