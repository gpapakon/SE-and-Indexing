<ABSTRACT>
A differential amplifier formed by a pair of transistors 
(U01C, U01B) couples a vertical sawtooth signal (VRAMP1) to an 

input side of a vertical deflection amplifier. Nonlinearity of the 
transistor pair provides S-correction in the vertical direction. The 

current in the transistor pair varies when vertical height is 
adjusted, in service operation, so that the nonlinearity changes. In 

a vertical shrink mode of operation, the amplitude of the sawtooth 
signal is reduced. The nonlinearity (ratio of VRAMP1/VSAW) 

associated with a given level of the sawtooth signal that 
corresponds to a given vertical position in the vertical shrink 

mode is the same as that associated with the same level of the 
sawtooth signal in the vertical, non-shrink mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a video display deflection
apparatus.Side by side pictures are an appealing feature for a
television apparatus, especially one having a wide screen display.
One can watch two programs simultaneously, with equal size
pictures. This can be significantly more pleasing than a picture-in
picture format, wherein a second picture overlays a main picture,
and is quite small in display area by comparison to the main
picture. However, side by side picture display formats can
present a problem, even on a wide screen display, because
significant amounts of subject matter might have to be cropped in
order to avoid image aspect ratio distortion.In a video display, embodying an aspect of the
invention, a vertical deflection angle of the video display device is
reduced when operating in the side-by-side display mode for
reducing image aspect ratio distortion. This is accomplished by
reducing the amplitude of a vertical deflection current in a
vertical deflection, referred to herein as a vertical shrink mode.It may be desirable to provide for S-correction in the
vertical deflection current both in normal operation, when most of
the entire height of the CRT display screen is utilized for picture
display purposes, and in the vertical shrink mode, when the
deflection angle is reduced for providing the aforementioned side-by-side
display mode.U.S. patent No. 5,229,692, entitled A VERTICAL
DEFLECTION ARRANGEMENT WITH S-CORRECTION, in the name of
Wilber discloses a differential amplifier formed by a pair of
transistors having a nonlinear gain. The differential amplifier
couples a vertical rate sawtooth signal to a vertical deflection
winding and introduces nonlinearity in the deflection current in a
manner to provide for S-correction. In, for example, service
operation, picture height adjustment is obtained by varying the
amplitude of the sawtooth signal. Adjustment of the picture
height also causes the gain nonlinearity of the amplifier to be
different at a given instantaneous value of the sawtooth signal for
different picture height adjustment settings. The variation of the
gain nonlinearity of the amplifier reduces changes in the 
nonlinearity of the deflection current that, otherwise, might be introduced as a result of the picture
height adjustment.GB-A-2 186 165 discloses a video display device for displaying wide aspect ratio (e.g.
16:9 or 5:3) pictures on a conventional (e.g. 4:3) display. The vertical scanning amplitude is
reduced by a factor necessary to preserve picture geometry. The change
