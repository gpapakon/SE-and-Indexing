<CLAIMS>
New polypropylenes having an improved profile of 
properties which are obtainable by chemical degradation 

of elastic polypropylenes having a stereoregular block 
arrangement in the polymer chain or mixtures of 

polypropylenes and elastic polypropylenes having a 
stereoregular block arrangement in the polymer chain by 

means of organic peroxides, if appropriate with the 
addition of customary additives and/or fillers. 
New polypropylenes according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the elastic polypropylenes employed for 

the degradation have an MFI (230°C/2.16 kg) of less than 
0.1 g/10 minutes. 
New polypropylenes according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that bis(2(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxyisopropyl)benzene 

or di-tert-butyl 
peroxide are employed as peroxides. 
New polypropylenes according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, 

pentaerythrityltetrakis-(3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionate), 
tris-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenyl) 

phosphite or tetrakis-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenyl) 
4,4'-biphenylene-diphosphonite or mixtures thereof are 

employed as stabilizers. 
Process for the preparation of new polypropylenes 
having an improved profile of properties, characterized 

in that elastic polypropylenes having a stereoregular 
block arrangement in the polymer chain or mixtures of 

polypropylenes and elastic polypropylenes having a 
stereoregular block arrangement in the polymer chain are 

degraded by means of organic peroxides, if appropriate  
 

with the addition of customary additives and/or fillers 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that 0.05 to 0.5 % by weight of peroxides, based on the 

amount of polypropylenes, are used. 
Process according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the degradation is carried out at temperatures of 

190 to 240°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that the degradation is carried out 

continuously in an extruder.
