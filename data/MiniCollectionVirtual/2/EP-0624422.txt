<ABSTRACT>
A status indicator system for a laser beam includes a laser; a device for 
transporting a laser beam from the laser to a target; an illumination source for providing 

a visible status beam through the means for transporting with the laser beam to the 
target; and a switching device for switching the laser between energized and unenergized 

conditions and for correspondingly switching the status beam between different states. 
one associated with each of the conditions of the laser.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved surgical laser system with a status indicator
system for indicating when a laser beam, especially an invisible one, is ready to fire or
not ready to fire.Lasers are becoming an ever more important part of the surgical environment.
They provide a precision, sterile means for performing even the most intricate of
procedures. In return they require intense concentration and full attention of the operator
and staff. Typically surgical laser equipment uses a CO2 laser or other laser whose beam
is not readily visible to the human eye but is nonetheless dangerous. To partially address
this problem visible non-harmful aiming beams such as from red HeNe lasers are
provided coincident with the track of the main beam to visually illustrated the path of the
laser beam. This also aids the surgeon in aiming the device so that it is perfectly aimed
at the surgical site when the main laser beam is energized. In addition, indicators are
employed on the laser equipment to show when the main beam is energized. However,
there are still a number of problems that occur. When a surgeon is aiming the laser
using a microscope or a laparoscope or in any other manner he must pay careful,
continuous attention to the site and the laser beam. But at some point when he is ready
to operate he must check to see if the laser is energized. This requires him to look up
out of the target field of view and momentarily lose sight of the target and perhaps lose
the registration of the beam. In addition, since the handpiece is separated from the laser 
and the main housing by the articulated arm that carries the beam from the laser to the
handpiece, the surgeon or others may pick up or handle the handpiece without being
aware that the laser is energized. Adding more indicators at the handpiece is expensive
and complicated since the indicator has to be wired through the articulated arm. It is
also cumbersome because the surgeon has to hold the handpiece for precise manipulation
and may cover the indicator. Further, the indicator, even the whole handpiece, may not
be visible in the surgeon's field of view. JP-A-1-151466
discloses a laser treatment apparatus including an invisible
laser beam and a LED visible light.
When the laser beam is energized, then also the led is energized, providing a visible signal
that the laser beam is on. 
US-A-4478217 discloses a
handpiece which vibrates when the laser beam is firing. US-A-4582405

<CLAIMS>
A surgical laser system with a status indicator
system comprising:


a surgical laser (52) which provides a surgical laser
beam for surgery;
switching means (42), remote from the surgical laser (52) and having
at least two switch positions, a ready position (50) for switching the

surgical laser to a condition wherein the surgical laser is ready
to fire and standby position (48) for switching the surgical laser to

a condition wherein the surgical laser is not ready to fire;
an illumination source (54) separate from the surgical laser (52) for
providing a visible laser status beam proximate the surgical

laser beam, said visible laser status beam being capable of at
least two states, a first state indicating that the surgical

laser is ready to fire and `a second state indicating that the
surgical laser is not ready to fire;
control means (50), responsive to said switching means (42) and
coupled to said illumination source (54), for automatically causing

said illumination source (54) to enter the first state when said
switching means (42) is switched to the ready position (49), and for

causing said illumination source (54) to enter the second state when
said switching means is switched to the standby position (48).
The system of claim 1 in which said surgical laser (52) is
a CO
2
 laser. 
The system of claim 1 in which said illumination
source (54) is a HeNe laser.
The system of claim 1 in which said illumination
source (54) includes a power source (75) and said control means includes

means (90,92,96) for varying the amount of power supplied by said power
source to fluctuate said visible laser status beam.
The system of claim 4 in which said control means
includes means for varying the amount of power supplied by the

power source (75) when said switching means (42) is in said ready position (50).
The system of claim 4 in which said control means
includes means for varying the amount of power supplied by the

power source (75) when said switching means (42) is in said standby
position (48).
The system of claim 1 in which said illumination
source includes a first laser (72) for providing a first color visible

laser status beam and a second laser (70) for providing a second color
visible laser status beam.
The system of claim 7 in which said control means
includes means (74) for causing said illumination source to operate

said first laser (72) when said switching means (42) is in said standby
position and for causing said illumination source to operate said

second laser (70) when said switching means (42) is in said ready position. 
The system of claim 1 further including means (102) for
varying the diameter of said visible laser status beam between

first and second diameter beams.
The system of claim 9 in which said first state is the
first diameter beam and said second state is the second diameter

beam. 
The system of claim 1 further including a foot switch (15)
connected to said switching means (42).
The system of claim 11 in which said switching means
includes means for operating said surgical laser to fire only

when said foot switch (15) is depressed and said switching means (42 is in
the ready position (49).
