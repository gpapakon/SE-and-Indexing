<ABSTRACT>
A microminiature cantilever structure is provided having a cantilever arm (102) with a piezoresistive resistor (120) embedded in at least the fixed end of th cantilever arm. Deflection of the free end of the cantilever arm produces stress in the base (150) of the cantilever that changes the piezoresistive resistor's resistance in proportion to the deflection. Resistance measuring apparatus (124) is coupled to the piezoresistive resistor. The microminiautre cantilever is formed on a semiconductor substrate (152). The cantilever arm is doped to form an electrically separate U-shaped piezoresistive resistor (160). A metal layer (266) is deposited over the semiconductor's surface and patterned to form electrical connections (162, 164) between the piezoresistive resistor and a resistance measuring circuit. The semiconductor substrate below the cantilever arm is substantially removed forming a cantilevered structure, and a tip (104) is connected to the free end of the cantilever arm for use in an atomic force microscope (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods of forming microcantilevers for 
use in atomic force microscopes and other microscope systems. An atomic force microscope (AFM) scans over the surface of a sample. Typically, 
in the "contacting mode" of operation, a sharp tip is mounted on the end of a 
cantilever and the tip rides on the surface of a sample with an extremely light 
tracking force, on the order of 10-5 to 10-10 N. Profiles of the surface topography 
are obtained with extremely high resolution. Images showing the position of 
individual atoms are routinely obtained. In a second mode of operation, the tip 
is held a short distance, on the order of 5 to 500 Angstroms, from the surface 
of a sample and is deflected by various forces between the sample and the tip; 
such forces include electrostatic, magnetic, and van der Waals forces. Atomic force microscopy is capable of imaging conductive as well as insulating 
surfaces with atomic resolution. Typical AFM's have a sensitivity of 0.1 Angstrom 
in the measurement of displacement, and a spring constant of about 1 Newton 
per meter (1 N/m). Further, the cantilever must be mounted so that the cantilever 
can approach and contact a sample.  
 Several methods of detecting the deflection of the 
cantilever are available which have a sub-angstrom 
sensitivity, including vacuum tunneling, optical 
interferometry, optical beam deflection, and capacitive 
techniques. Optically operated AFM's, while very accurate, 
are more difficult to build and operate than the present 
invention because several optical components and fine 
alignments are required. "IEEE Electron Device Letters", vol 10, No. 11,

dielectric layers upon which conductors are deposited. The 
ZnO layers possess piezoelectric properties whereby 
deflection of the cantilever provides corresponding 
electric signals on the conductors. US Patent No. 4706374 discloses an accelerometer
