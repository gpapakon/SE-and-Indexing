<ABSTRACT>
A bezel connector (28) for an electronic device in 
a vehicle, such as a radio (20), having a removable bezel 

(24). The bezel connector (28) has a support member (38) 
that is removably attached to the radio housing (21), and 

along with the other components of the connector form a 
removable module. The support member (34) supports a PC 

board (42), which has connector pins (52) protruding 
therefrom in spaced relationship. The connector pins (52) 

are rigid and protrude from the PC board (42) in a 
cantilever fashion. Also movably supported by the support 

member is a cover member (62) having an electrically 
conducting portion (76). The cover member (62) includes 

holes (70) aligned with the connector pins (52) to thereby 
shield and support the connector pins. Grounding springs 

(90) bias the cover member (62) in a position which 
selectively shields the connector pins (52) and also 

provides an electrical connection between the cover member 
(62) and the radio housing (21) to discharge any static 

electricity charge that may be imparted to the cover member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive radios and 
more particularly to automotive radios having removable 
bezels. Vehicle radios are becoming more and more 
sophisticated and as a result more expensive. The radio, 
being mounted with its control panel (i.e., bezel) located 
visibly on the vehicle instrument panel, is an easy target 
for thieves. This has led to an increase in theft of car 
radios. Consequently, some vehicle radios are now designed 
to be rendered inoperative if stolen from a vehicle. Typical measures taken to discourage thieves 
include rendering the radio inoperable in a visible manner. 
This can be done by providing a radio alarm or by allowing 
for removal of the entire radio when the vehicle operator 
leaves the vehicle. This can also be done by requiring the 
entry of a security code to get the unit to play. 
Additionally, thieves can be discouraged by allowing an 
occupant to remove the entire radio bezel when the operator 
leaves the vehicle so the car radio loses its appearance as 
a car radio. Further, some are designed such that an 
operator may remove only an essential portion of a bezel to 
render the radio inoperable. Removing only the bezel is 
easier than requiring the removal of the entire radio since 
the overall radio tends to be heavy and bulky; also, this 
does not require occupants to remember a security code. More often, a removable radio bezel is preferred 
because it is small and light weight, which makes it easy to 
carry around. The removable portion of the bezel has 
contacts exposed on its back side that are electrically 
connected to the radio buttons on the front of the bezel. 
When referring to front and back herein, front refers to the 
side of the radio facing the occupant on the instrument 
panel of the vehicle, while back refers to the side of the 
radio that extends into the instrument panel of the vehicle.  
 
The electrical contacts on the bezel can be fabricated as a 
separate part affixed to the removable bezel circuit board 
or they can be integral with the removable bezel circuit 
board. The contacts maintain surface contact with connector 
pins, mounted within a recess to the fixed portion of the 
radio, when the removable portion of the bezel is installed 
into the radio. The buttons and knobs on the removable 
bezel will then be electrically connected to the connector 
pins. The connector pins, in turn, are electrically 
connected to the main circuit board of the radio. In general, the pins are directly connected to the 
main radio circuit

An electronic device for use in a vehicle 
comprising: 


a grounded housing (21) for enclosing an electronic 
circuit and adapted to be mounted to the vehicle; 
a bezel (22) having a removable portion (24) for 
repeated removal from the housing (21) for disabling the 

electronic device; 
a bezel connector (28) for disabling the electronic 
circuit each time the removable portion (24) is removed, the 

bezel connector (28) having a support member (38) mounted to 
the housing and being provided with a number of contacts 

for establishing electrical contact between the 
electronic circuit and the removable bezel (24); and 
a cover member (62) having an electrically conductive 
portion (76), said cover member (62) being provided with a 

spring (90) made from an electrically conductive material 
which serves to selectively move the cover member (62) into 

a position where it shields the contacts each time 
the removable portion (24) is removed and electrically 

connecting the housing (21) to the electrically conductive 
portion (76) of the cover member (62) for grounding any 

static charge engaging the conductive portion of the cover 
member (62);
 
characterised by: 
a connector circuit board (42) adapted to be 
electrically connected to the electronic circuit and mounted 

in the support member (38); 
said contacts comprising 
a plurality of connector pins (52) extending from the 

connector circuit board (42) and spaced from each other, the 
connector pins (52) being made of an electrically conductive 

material sufficiently rigid to resist bending thereof;  
 
said cover member (62) being movably mounted with 
respect to the said support member (38) and the connector 

circuit board (42) and being provided with a plurality of 
openings (70), each opening reciprocally receiving one end 

(54) of a respective connector pin (52) in a sufficiently 
guiding and concealing relationship therewith to 

continuously space the said electrically conductive portion 
(76) from the connector pins (52) and to selectively shield 

the ends (54) of said connector pins; and 
said spring (90) including a portion in biasing 
engagement (96) with the connector circuit board (42) for 

biasing the respective ends of the connector pins (52) for 
movement toward the removable portion (24) when the 

removable portion (24) is not removed. 
An electronic device as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the connector pins (52) are substantially straight, 

have a predetermined cross-sectional configuration, are 
rigidly mounted in the connector circuit board (42) and 

extend in cantilever fashion from one side of the connector 
board (42); and each opening (70) of the cover member (62) 

closely conforms to the cross-sectional configuration of a 
respective pin (52), to thereby continuously guide and 

support the pins (52) when the cover member (62) moves 
relative to the connector board (42). 
An electronic device as claimed in either claim 1 
or claim 2, wherein the support member (38), connector 

circuit board (42), connector pins (52), cover member (62), 
and spring (90) form a module, the module being removably 

mounted to the housing. 
An electronic device as claimed in either claim 1 
or claim 2, wherein the connector circuit board (42) is 

removably connectable to the electronic circuit.
