<ABSTRACT>
Process for chemically thinning the vine which consists in determining, in order to obtain a given degree of thinning, the amount, which is a function of the desired given degree of thinning and of the normal output which would be obtained without thinning treatment, at which it is advisable to apply an ethephon solution to the vineyard to be treated.

Process for chemical thinning of grapevine 
characterized by the fact that, to obtain a given 

predetermined thinning rate, a solution of ethephon, 
advantageously at a rate of about 360 g/ha, is applied to 

grapevine, especially by spraying, at a precise moment 
during one of the days of the period of about 15 days 

which separates the stage of the late flowering , i.e. 
stage 25 according to Eichhorn 
&
 Lorenz, from that of the 
beginning of berry touch, i.e. stage 33 according to 

Eichhorn 
&
 Lorenz, the said moment which is a function of 
the given requested thinning rate and of the normal yield 

which would have been obtained without thinning treatment, 
being determined, for a given plot of grapevine to be 

treated, by proceeding at regular intervals, generally 
every two to four days, to a pool of observations 

consisting of an examination of the stocks of several 
plots regularly spread over the vineyard and comprising 

each the same given number of stocks, the said examination 
consisting of counting in each plot the number of grapes 

corresponding respectively to each of the stages according 
to Eichhorn 
&
 Lorenz, of multiplying the number of grapes 
corresponding to each of these stages by the rate of the 

corresponding thinning class and of dividing the sum of 
the thus obtained values by the total number of grapes, 

which provides the probable thinning rate at the given day 
of observation for the plot, the average of the values 

recorded for the whole of the plots giving the value of 
the probable thinning rate of the vineyard, the said pool 

of observations being repeated until the day at which the 
probable thinning rate thus determined is very close to 

the requested thinning rate, the whole plot being then 
treated, preferably the same day, by the abovesaid  

 
solution of ethephon, the stages according to Eichhorn 
&
 
Lorenz being as follows: 


Stage 
Description of the stage 
Thinning Class 
25
Late flowering: 80% of flowerhoods fallen
100% 
26
Very early fruit set, 90% of flowerhoods fallen
95% 
27
Fruit set: young fruits begin to swell, remains of flowers lost
90% 
28
Berries little piece of lead-sized
75% 
29
Berries piece of lead-sized
50% 
30
Berries pea-sized
35% 
31
Berries big pea-sized
25% 
32
Bunch closing
5% 
33
Beginning of berry touch
0% 
Process according to claim 1, characterized by 
the use of tables prepared in advance and comprising for 

each plot of the vineyard which is observed, boxes 
corresponding to each of the thinning classes, boxes in 

which are indicated, on the one hand, the number n of 
grapes which are at the phenologic stage of the grapevine 

corresponding to the thinning class in question and, on 
the other hand, possibly the number obtained by the 

multiplication of the number of grapes by the percentage 
of the corresponding thinning class, the said tables 

comprising also for each plot a box reserved for the 
indication of the probable average thinning rate 

determined for this plot and, preferably, a box reserved 
for indicating the average of thinning rates of the group 

of plots comprised in the vineyard, average which 
corresponds to the probable thinning rate at the day of 

observation for the entire vineyard.
