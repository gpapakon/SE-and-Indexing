<ABSTRACT>
In a microcomputer including a microprogram storing 
memory (1) for receiving a first address information 

signal (ADD1) to generate control signals (C1, C2,...) and 
a second address information signal (ADD2), there is 

provided a selector (2') for receiving the second 
addressing signal, an operation code signal as a third 

address information signal (ADD3) and a fourth address 
information signal (ADD4) from a counter (7). In a burn-in 

test mode, the selector selects the fourth address 
information signal and transmits it as the first address 

information signal to the microprogram storing memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
microprogrammed microcomputer capable of a dynamic burn-in 
test screening operation. In a prior art, in order to eliminate defective 
microcomputers resulting from time and stress due to 
inherent defects or manufacturing fluctuations, a burn-in 
test screening method is carried out at a stage of 
testing at shipment. As typical burn-in test screening 
methods, there are a static burn-in test screening method 
and a dynamic burn-in test screening method. In a static burn-in test screening method for a 
microcomputer, all of the input/output terminals are made 
to b at special levels, and power supply voltages are 
applied to power supply terminals, so that the 
microcomputer is not operated. This microcomputer is left 
alone in a high temperature state. In the static burn-in 
test screening method, since the microcomputer is not 
operated, stress is not equally applied to all of the 
transistors of the microcomputer, thus obtaining only a 
small burn-in test screening effect. On the other hand, in a dynamic burn-in test 
screening method for a microcomputer, the microcomputer 
is operated and left alone in a high temperature state. 
As a result, voltages are applied to all of the 
transistors of the microcomputer, so that stress is 
applied to all of the transistors as equally as possible, 
thus enhancing the burn-in test screening effect. In a dynamic burn-in test screening method for a 
prior art read-only memory (ROM)-incorporating single-chip 
microcomputer, a clock signal is supplied from the 
exterior to a central processing unit (CPU), and as a  
 
result, instructions are read out of the ROM and are 
carried out in the same way as in usual processing, to 
thereby enhance the burn-in test screening effect. 
However, if jump (branch) instructions for looping a 
program, conditional instructions and the like are 
present stored in the ROM, only special addresses of the 
ROM are looped to carry out only special loops, so that 
the program is locked in the loop. In this case, all of 
the transistors are not always operated, and thus, it is 
impossible to enhance the burn-in test screening effect. 
In order to avoid the above-described problem, the CPU 
invalidates any jump instructions, and therefore, it is 
possible to carry out all of the instructions stored in 
the ROM except for the jump instructions, thus enhancing 
the burn-in test screening effect (see: JP-A-SHO60-31652) 
. This will be explained later in detail. However, in the above-described prior art
