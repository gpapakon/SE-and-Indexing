<ABSTRACT>
A first conductor plane (LE1), a dielectric layer (DS) and a second conductor plane (LE2) are produced successively on a substrate (S) which is produced by injection moulding and is provided with a trough (M), after which an electronic component (B) is inserted into the trough (M), the connections (A) of the component (B) are electrically conductively connected to associated connecting surfaces (AF) on the substrate (S), preferably by bonding, and encapsulation (V) for the component (B) is then formed by filling the trough (M) with plastic. The result is a compact, thin design, with a high wiring density. The recessed installation and encapsulation of components in troughs in the injection-moulded substrate results in the component and its connecting wiring being optimally protected, in addition to the thickness being reduced.
