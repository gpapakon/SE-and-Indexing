<ABSTRACT>
A radar system for sensing the presence of obstacles in a vehicle's "blind spots" and generating a signal (41) to the vehicle operator indicative of the presence of such an obstacle. The system uses a common radar transceiver (7) that transmits a radio frequency signal directed at a blind spot of the vehicle. A Doppler shift in the received reflected frequency generally indicates that an obstacle has moved into the blind spot. Doppler frequencies attrributable to objects which are of no interest, such as stationary objects, are filtered out. Only obstacles that are traveling at approximately the same speed and direction as the vehicle are considered to be of interest, and will cause the blind spot sensor to generate an indication that an obstacle is present in the blind spot. The indication is preferably an unobstrusive illuminated indicator which is affixed to one of the vehicle's mirrors. An obstrusive audible indicator is provided which creates an audible tone, whistle, or buzz when an obstacle is present and the vehicle's turn signal is active.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive radar systems, and
more particularly to a radar system for sensing the
presence of obstacles in a vehicle's "blind spots".A continuing problem that presents itself to operators
of automotive vehicles is the difficulty in seeing
obstacles near the vehicle but in a location that is
difficult to observe from the driver's seat. Such
regions are commonly referred to as "blind spots". For
example, the angles between 90° and 170° from the
forward direction of a vehicle (i.e., to the right of
the vehicle and slightly behind the operator thereof)
is a common blind spot, particularly for large vehicles
such as buses and trucks. This right-side blind spot
is a source of numerous accidents when a drive makes a
right-hand turn or a right lane change and does not see
another vehicle in the blind spot. Another common
blind spot is the rear of a vehicle when backing up.The most common solution to the problem of blind spots
has been to use mirrors to aid the operator of the
vehicle in determining whether obstacles are present in
a blind spot. Such mirrors have been made in a variety
of shapes and mounted in various locations to provide
the operator with the greatest ability to detect
obstacles in particular blind spots. For example, it
is common place today to see a concave mirror mounted
to the right side of a vehicle aimed at the right-side
blind spot. While mirrors provide the operator with
some information regarding the presence of obstacles in
certain of a vehicle's blind spots, but they are less 
useful at night and under adverse weather conditions. Hence, a more complete and
satisfactory solution is still sought by many.A known alternative to the use of mirrors to detect obstacles in a vehicle's blind spot
is to mount a camera on the vehicle to provide the operator with a visual image of
obstacles in the vehicle's blind spot. However, this solution is complex and
expensive, requiring a video camera and video monitor. Further, a video monitor can
present a complex image that must be interpreted by a driver, and such monitors can
be distracting. Moreover, like mirrors, such camera systems are less useful at night
and under adverse weather conditions.Therefore, there is presently a need for a simple, and inexpensive solution to the
problem of detecting hazardous obstacles in the blind spots of a vehicle. Such a
solution should also be useful at night and under adverse weather conditions. The
present invention provides such a solution.EP-A-0381016 discloses a system for a vehicle

A system for detecting the presence of targets moving at slow speeds relative
to the vehicle upon which the system is mounted and adjacent to, and on at

least one side of, the vehicle upon which the system is mounted, including:

(a) a transceiver (7) for emitting signals along side a vehicle upon which the
system is mounted and for receiving reflections of the emitted signals;
(b) a Doppler circuit (9), coupled to the transceiver (7), for generating a Doppler
signal having a frequency equal to the difference between the emitted signal

and the received reflections;
(c) a signal processing section (11) including:

(1) an amplifier (21), coupled to the Doppler circuit (9), for amplifying the
Doppler signal such that only targets within a predetermined range

equivalent to a road lane spacing from the transceiver (7) are detected
characterised in that the signal processing section further includes:
(2) a sample and hold circuit (23), coupled to the amplifier (21), for
sampling the output of the amplifier (21) during periods concurrent

with the emission of the emitted signals and generating a signal having
a voltage level that is proportional to the phase difference between the

emitted signal and received reflections;

which the system is mounted from the signal output by the sample and

for sensing the level of the direct current offset of the signal generated
by the sample and hold circuit (23), to determine when the system is

(b) the indication of the presence of an object is by means of a visual indicator:
