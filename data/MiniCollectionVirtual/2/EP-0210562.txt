<ABSTRACT>
Methods for overcoming transient magnetic field grad­
ient inhomogeneity in a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging 

and/or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging 
system, wherein the inhomogeneities are induced by the 

pulsed magnetic field gradients utilized in the imaging pro­
cess itself, provide at least one correction pulse signal during, 

or after, any application of the desired magnetic field to the 
sample-to-be-investigated in the system. At least one of the 

pulse signal characteristics is adjusted to oppose and sub­
stantially cancel an error-producing portion of the total mag­

netic field gradient in a particular direction. The magnetic field 
gradient correction signal(s) can be applied: during a non-­

selective RF pulse; immediately subsequent to an initial grad­
ient field application (either alone or coincident with a selec­

tive 180° RF pulse); during acquisition of response signal 
data; or at any time to correct for inter-gradient cross-talk con­

ditions.
