According to the invention:     - in a preliminary step:     . load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp) are defined; and . the laws of variation of the allowable values (C1ad, C2ad, ..., Cpad) of these load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp) are determined as a function of input parameters (P1, P2, ..., Pn); and     - at the moment of landing:   . the values of the said input parameters (P1, P2, ..., Pn) and of the said load criteria (C1, C2, ... Cp) are measured; . the allowable values (C1ad, C2ad, ..., Cpad) of the said load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp) are calculated; . for each of the said load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp), the actual measured value (C1m, C2m, ..., Cpm) are compared with the calculated allowable value (C1ad, C2ad, ..., Cpad); and . the decision is taken as to whether structural inspection is to be carried out.

Method for detecting that the design loads of an 
aircraft have been exceeded during landing, necessitating 

a structural inspection of the said aircraft being 
invoked, characterized in that: 


in a preliminary step: 

load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp) are defined, which 
are measurable on the aircraft and representative of 

the effective loads to which the aircraft is subjected; 
and 
laws of variation of the allowable values (C1ad, 
C2ad, ..., Cpad) of these load criteria (C1, C2, ..., 

Cp) are determined as a function of input parameters 
(P1, P2, ..., Pn) measurable on the aircraft; and 
at the moment of landing: 

the values of the said input parameters (P1, P2, ..., 
Pn) and of the said load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp) 

are measured; 
on the basis of the said laws of variation and of the 
said measured values of the input parameters, the 

allowable values (C1ad, C2ad, ..., Cpad) of the said 
load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp) are calculated; 
for each of the said load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp), 
the measured effective value (C1m, C2m, ..., Cpm) is 

compared with the calculated allowable value (C1ad, 
C2ad, ..., Cpad); and 
on the basis of the result of the various comparisons, 
it is determined whether a structural inspection 

has to be carried out. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, on the basis of the result of the various comparisons, 

the type of structural inspection to be carried out 
is determined as appropriate. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that, according to the type of structural inspection to 

be carried out, one or more of the following parts of the 
aircraft are checked: the nose landing gear, the main 

landing gear, the central landing gear, the wings, the  
 

fuselage and the engine pylons. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, in order to determine the law of 

variation of the allowable values (Ciad) of a load 
criterion (Ci) as a function of an input parameter (Pi), 

the corresponding allowable value (Ciad) of the load 
criterion is sought for various values of the said input 

parameter (Pi), by carrying out the following steps, for 
each of the said various values of the input parameter: 


a) an assumed value of the load criterion is chosen; 
b) the said assumed value of the load criterion and the 
said value of the input parameter are inserted into 

a landing model; 
c) with the aid of this landing model, the effective 
loads to which the aircraft is subjected are determined; 
d) these effective loads determined are compared with 
the design limit loads; and 
e) if the said loads are equal, the said assumed value 
of the load criterion is defined as allowable value, 

corresponding to the said value of the input parameter; 
otherwise, steps a) to e) are repeated, 

choosing a different assumed value of the load 
criterion. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the law of variation of the allowable values (Ciad) 

of a load criterion (Ci), as a function of an input 
parameter (Pi), is of the form 


Ciad = a3Pi
3
 + a2Pi
2
 + a1Pi + a0 
 
an expression in which a0, a1, a2 and a3 represent 

constant coefficients. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that, in order to determine the law of variation of the 

allowable values (Cjad) of a load criterion (Cj), as a 
function of several input parameters (P1, P2, ..., Pn), 

the corresponding allowable value (Cjad) of the load 
criterion (Cj) is sought for different combinations of 

values of the said input parameters (P1, P2, ..., Pn), by 
carrying out the said steps a) to e), for each of the  

 
said combinations, for which the chosen values of all the 

said input parameters (P1, P2, ..., Pm) are input each 
time into the landing model. 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the law of variation of the allowable values (Cjad) 

of a load criterion (Cj), as a function of input parameters 
(P1, P2, ..., Pn), is of the form 


Cjad = b1P1 + b2P2 + ... + bnPn 
 
an expression in which b1, b2, ..., bn represent constant 

coefficients. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that, as input parameters (P1, P2, ..., 

Pn), at least some of the said following parameters are 
used: the mass of the aircraft, the centre of gravity of 

the aircraft, the acceleration at the moment of landing, 
the maximum acceleration recorded in the course of the 

landing, the attitude of the aircraft, the roll-off speed 
and the roll speed. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, as load criteria (C1, C2, ..., 

Cp), at least some of the said following criteria are

lateral acceleration and the vertical load on the nose 

gear.

P2, ..., Pn);

to measure the values (C1m, C2m, ..., Cpm) of the said 

load criteria (C1, C2, ..., Cp); 
a computer (CAL) linked to the said first set (E1) of 
sensors, including the laws of variation of the allowable 

values of the load criteria, receiving the 
measured values of the input parameters (P1, P2, ..., 

Pn) and determining the corresponding allowable values 
(C1ad, C2ad, ..., Cpad) of the load criteria (C1, C2,  

 
..., Cp); and 
a comparison device (DC), linked to the said second set 
(E2) of sensors and to the said computer (CAL), comparing 

the measured effective value (C1m, C2m, ..., Cpm), 
for each load criterion (C1, C2, ..., Cp), with the 

calculated allowable value (C1ad, C2ad, ..., Cpad), 
determining, from the said comparisons, whether a 

structural inspection has to be carried out and communicating
