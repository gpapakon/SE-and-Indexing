<ABSTRACT>
An improved coating composition is detailed which increases 
the range of differential pressure within which a photographic 

element can be coated on a slide bead coating apparatus. The 
improved composition comprises a novel combination of the 

polymer shown in Formula 1 and the surfactant shown in Formula 
2. The substituents are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coated photographic
element.Coating of photographic elements has been known in the art
as has the use of a slide-bead coating apparatus to accomplish the
task.Slide bead coaters are well known in the art to utilize a
pressure differential on the upper and lower surfaces of the
coating solution to reduce air entrapment and to facilitate the
formation of a liquid bead, or bridge, between the surface of the
coater and the substrate being coated.For a given coating solution at a given coating rate the range
of operative differential pressure, also known as vacuum range, is
defined by an upper limit and a lower limit. Above the upper
limit streaks and other defects occur which decreases the
usefulness of the final product. Below the lower limit the stability
of the bead degrades and the edges of the coating are drawn in
towards the center of the coating which is catastrophic. It is the
goal of the artisan to maintain an operating differential pressure
which is between the upper and lower limits and which will not
encroach on either limit when minor operational fluctuations
occur.One of the main goals of a skilled artisan is the ability to
achieve higher coating rates. As the coating rate is increased the
difference between the upper and lower limits of differential
pressure diminishes as described in Zeldes U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,764. 
Due to this conflict there is an ongoing need in the art for coating
compositions which can effectively increase the range of
differential pressure.The present invention provides a coated
photographic element comprising a support, a hydrophilic colloid
layer on at least one side of said support wherein said hydrophilic
colloid layer further comprises at least one polymer defined by
Formula 1:

y/xis 1 to 23;Zis a divalent linking group represented by the formula -(R2)nL-
or -L-(R2)n- where R2 is an alkylene, arylene, or aralkylene

carbon atoms;
said hydrophilic colloid layer further comprises at least one
surfactant defined by Formula 2:
