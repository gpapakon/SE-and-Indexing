<ABSTRACT>
A refining element for a disk refiner, which element is provided on its front side with working members (2) and is formed with through holes (4) for its attachment on a holder in the refiner. The refining element (1) further is provided with at least one centrally located threaded hole (5), which in operation is covered from the front side by a covering screw (7). At the exchange of refining elements, the threaded hole (5) is intended for a longer screw, by means of which the element (1) can be removed from the holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refining element for disk refiners.
The element is provided on its front side with
working members for defibering and refining lignocellulose-containing
fiber material. The refining element further
is formed with through holes for attaching it on a holder
in the refiner by means of screws.
This kind of refining element is disclosed in US-A-1 599 118 and
DE-A-2 315 218.A plurality of such refining elements are attached in the
refiner in the form of a ring about each of two opposed
holders, which are rotary relative to each other. Both
holders can be rotated in opposed directions, or one holder
can be rotary and one stationary.At refining, the material passes through the refining gap,
which is formed between refining elements on the opposed
holders. During said passage, the material is worked simultaneously.
This working normally takes place in continuous
operation under high pressure end temperature, whereby the
working members on the front sides of the refining elements
are subjected to wear. Due to the wear, the quality of the
worked fiber material deteriorates, so that the refining
elements must be exchanged after a certain time. This time
can amount to several months.At the necessary exchange, of the refining elements, it was
found that the old elements have got stuck so rigidly, due
to baked fibers and extract substances, that they can be
removed only with great trouble and after a long time.
In many cases it is not sufficient to loosen the holding
screws. Since the refining elements are fixed very tightly
on the holder, there is no space for removing them by
prising. In certain cases it was necessary to knock off or
cut to pieces one of the elements for being able to remove
the elements, which moreover involves the risk of accidents.
After one of the elements has been removed, it is
relatively simple to take off the remaining elements. The present invention,
defined in the characterising portion of claim 1,
offers a solution of the aforesaid
problems. Its object, thus, is to design a refining element,
which renders it possible to rapidly and simply remove
refining elements from a holder in a disk refiner at satisfactory
safety for both staff and machine equipment.The invention is described in greater detail in the following,
with reference to the accompanying drawing showing
an embodiment of a refining element according to the invention.

<CLAIMS>
A refining element for a disk refiner, which element is
provided on its front side with working members (2) and is

formed with through holes (4) for its attachment on a holder in
the refiner, 
characterized
 in that the refining
element (1) is further provided with a centrally located threaded hole

(5), which in operation is coverable from the front side by a
covering screw (7), and at the exchange of refining elements is

intended for a longer screw, by means of which the element (1)
can be removed from the holder.
A refining element as stated in claim 1,

characterized
 in that the covering screw (7)
extends only just through the refining element (1) and has a

head, which is located 1-3 mm beneath the surface of the working
members (2).
