<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the manufacture of concrete roof tiles having increased early strength. In particular, this is produced by including crushed waste concrete in the cementitious mixture. For example, the increased strength is obtained if (i) crushed waste concrete is used as a replacement for aggregate; (ii) crushed waste concrete is used as a nucleating agent; and (iii) crushed waste concrete is graded such that it can be used to replace aggregate and to effect nucleation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of concrete 
building products and is particularly concerned with a cementitious 
composition for the manufacture of concrete roof tiles which 
exhibit improved handling properties. It is well known that concrete attains its ultimate strength over 
a period of many years, and that after one year the improvement 
in strength is very slow. During the early life of concrete roof tiles, that is while the 
cement is setting and the concrete is hardening, care must be 
taken in the handling of the tiles to avoid breakage. In the 
preparation of concrete roof tiles, it is necessary to depallet 
the tiles as soon as possible so that the pallets may be re-used; 
however, there is a risk of an undue proportion of breakages if 
the tiles are taken from the pallets too early. To reduce the risk of breakage, it is possible to add certain 
chemical admixtures which are known to increase the rate of set 
of concrete. For example, the use of chloride salts such as 
CaCl2; CaCl2+Na2SO4; NaCl, KCl, MgCl2 and MnCl2 dates back to the 
1920's and more recently non-chlorine containing additives such 
as ligno-sulphonate derivatives and Conplast NC (the trademark 
given to an admixture commercially available from Fosroc CCD Ltd) 
have been used. However, although all of these accelerators are, 
to some extent, effective for promoting the setting of concrete 
in general, their use in concrete for roof tiles has not been 
found to be particularly beneficial. Coupled with this, the use 
of such strength accelerators increases the cost of concrete tile 
production. The occurrence in the manufacture of concrete roof tiles of broken 
or otherwise defective tiles leads to an accumulation of waste 
which is difficult and expensive to dispose of. In addition, the 
re-roofing of dwellings adds to the problem of waste disposal. 
Our research has found alternative methods of waste concrete  
 
disposal. One particularly favourable method involves crushing 
the waste concrete and incorporating this crushed material in the 
production of new concrete roof tiles. The practice of recycling crushed waste concrete is known in the 
prior art. For example, EP 353439 discloses the recovery of 
broken concrete paving stones followed by crushing and recycling 
the broken fragments in the production of further paving stones. 
JP 90040005 describes recycling concrete waste produced on 
destroying cement concrete structures, by utilising a mixture of 
the waste and blast furnace slag powder to make
