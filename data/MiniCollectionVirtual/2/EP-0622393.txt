<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modified
aromatic polycarbonate resin, a molded article thereof,
a composition thereof, and a substituted phenol
compound used for the modification of an aromatic
polycarbonate resin. It also relates to a modified
aromatic polyester carbonate resin and a modified
polyarylate resin. In particular, it relates to a
modified aromatic polycarbonate resin which retains the
excellent transparency and mechanical properties of an
aromatic polycarbonate resin and has improved melt
fluidity and tracking resistance and a molded article
thereof.As a typical aromatic polycarbonate resin, an
aromatic polycarbonate resin obtained by reacting 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane
(generally called bisphenol
A) with phosgene or a carbonate precursor such as
diphenyl carbonate is known and mass-produced. This
polycarbonate resin is widely used in a variety of
fields since a molded article thereof has excellent
properties such as excellence in transparency, heat
resistance and dimensional accuracy. In recent years,
the polycarbonate resin is also widely used as a
substrate for information recording media in the field
of an optical disk.With a recent downsizing tendency of
household utensils, home electric appliances, video
units and their accessories and audio units and their
accessories, it is now desired to develop an aromatic
polycarbonate resin which is much more improved in melt
fluidity and replicating properties. In the field of
electric appliances, it is also demanded to develop an 
aromatic polycarbonate resin having improved tracking
resistance.For improving an aromatic polycarbonate resin
in the melt fluidity, there is proposed a method in
which the average molecular weight of the aromatic
polycarbonate resin is decreased to the lowest level
possible, a method in which a plasticizer is added, a
method in which the polymer terminal is provided with a
long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon substituent or a
method in which a polymer blend is formed.
It is known from US-A-4,064,195 that mixing polycaprolactone with polycarbonate improves its melt stability.
US-A-4,699,974 describes a method of preparation of copolyestercarbonate by polymerisation of lactone and
cyclic polycarbonate in a homogeneous system to allow simultaneous forming operations such as extrusion,
injection moulding and rotational moulding. The defect
with these methods is that the excellent properties
inherent to an aromatic polycarbonate resin cannot be
retained, that is, the physical properties are
decreased or the
