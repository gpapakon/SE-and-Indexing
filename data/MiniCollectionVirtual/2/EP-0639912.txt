<ABSTRACT>
The integrated circuit (1) comprises a device (10) for impedance matching to the characteristic impedance (Zc) of transmission lines (13) each linking a transmitter (11) to a receiver (12). Two matching units (14, 15) reproduce the respective structures of the transmitters (11) and of the receivers (12) and their impedance matching is carried out on the basis of a reference resistor (Rr). A slaving device (Len, Lep, Lrn, Lrp) reproduces the matching conditions in the respective transmitters (11) and receivers (12).
