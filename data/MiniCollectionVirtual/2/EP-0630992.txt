<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus serve for the treatment of workpieces (13) with a liquid (41), in particular for cleaning metallic workpieces for the heat treatment which follows the cleaning. The workpieces (13) are introduced into a washing tank (11), and the latter is then closed airtightly. A low pressure is produced in the washing tank (11). Furthermore, a direct line connection (27, 28, 29, 33) is established to a tank (40) containing the liquid (41). To fill the washing tank (11), the low pressure is set so that the liquid (41) is sucked into the washing tank (11).

Method for cleaning metal workpieces (13) with a 
liquid (41) for a heat treatment subsequent to the 

cleaning, comprising the following process steps: 

a) introducing the workpieces (13) into a washing 
tank (11); 
b) sealing the washing tank (11) air-tight; 
c) establishing a line connection (27, 28, 29, 33; 
30, 31, 32) to a tank (40), containing the liquid 

(41), that is arranged below the washing tank 
(11); 
d) with the line connection open, creating and 
adjusting a first vacuum by means of a vacuum 

pump (65) in such a way that the liquid (41) is 
drawn upward into the washing tank (11) until a 

predefined liquid level is present, the line 
connection (27, 28, 29, 33; 30, 31, 32) 

connecting the washing tank (11) directly to the 
tank (10); 
e) closing the line connection (27, 28, 29, 33; 30, 
31, 32); 
f) creating and adjusting a second vacuum by means 
of the vacuum pump (65), such that the liquid 

(41) in the washing tank (11) boils below the 
boiling temperature applicable at atmospheric 

pressure; 
g) opening the line connection (27, 28, 29, 33) so 
that the liquid (41) flows downward back into the 

tank (40); 
h) closing the line connection (27, 28, 29, 33); and  
 
i) creating and adjusting a third vacuum by means of 
the vacuum pump (65), so that the workpieces (13) 

are vacuum-dried. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
liquid (41) is drawn in through a connection (27) in 

the region of a floor (16) of the washing tank (11). 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
liquid (41) is drawn in through a surge shower (31) 

that is arranged above the workpieces (13) in the 
washing tank (11). 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that in order to create the vacuum, 

air is extracted from the washing tank (11) and passed 
over a condensation device (52). 
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that 
condensate is separated from the extracted air in the 

condensation device (52), and the condensate is fed to 
the tank (40). 
Method according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that as the liquid (41) is drawn out of the tank (40) 

into the washing tank (11), the tank (40) is aerated 
with the air emerging from the condensation device 

(52).
