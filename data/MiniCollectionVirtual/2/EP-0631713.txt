Process for soldering electronic components to 
printed circuit boards in accordance with a wave soldering 

process, 

in which the printed circuit boards are transported 
beyond one or more solder wave or solder waves formed of 

liquid solder, the soldering procedure itself taking 
place at the solder wave or the solder waves, 
and in which optionally steps may be carried out, which 
may precede or succeed this soldering procedure, for 

example a preheating step and/or a cooling step, 
 
characterized
 
in that at least the soldering procedure itself is 

carried out under low pressure and under the plasma 
effect of a process gas. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the soldering procedure is preceded or succeeded by 

steps which are carried out under the same low pressure 
as the soldering process itself. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the work is carried out at a low pressure of less 

than 100 mbar, preferably between 0.5 and 20 mbar. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a preheating step is carried out 

and, during the preheating, pretreatment of the elements 
to be connected by soldering is achieved by a plasma 

effect generated there or reaching thereinto,
 
the same process gas as is used to form the soldering 

atmosphere being used there to form the plasma atmosphere. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that the atmosphere during the preheating step is an 
atmosphere which differs from the gas atmosphere during 

the soldering procedure. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that use is made of a process gas which 

simultaneously contains oxygen and hydrogen and, at least 
as a plasma, has both a reducing and an oxidizing effect. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that a gas mixture comprising 


0.5 to 10 vol.%
oxygen 
80 to 20 vol.%
hydrogen 
20 to 80 vol.%
CF
4
, N
2
 or Ar 
 
is used as the process gas. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the plasma effect or the plasma 

from the process gas is generated by microwaves, highfrequency 
waves and/or a glow discharge with suitable 

energy. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that plasma is generated in the immediate 

vicinity of the soldering procedure, that is to say 
at the soldering location. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that a solder bath (48) is connected as the cathode of a 

glow discharge. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the plasma is generated outside the 

soldering installation and then, if appropriate having 
been divided, is supplied to the soldering installation. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the process gas is mixed on site. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the process gas is provided as a 

prepared mixture. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the preheating is effected using 

infrared light, microwaves or other suitable electro-magnetic 
waves. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 13,  
 

characterized in that the preheating is effected by 
energy input via the plasma. 
Through-flow wave soldering installation having 
a soldering station (4) and further stations, namely a 

preheating station (28) as well as a cooling or outflow 
zone (5),
 
characterized in that an installation chamber (6) is 

provided containing the soldering station (4) and the 
further stations, which chamber is gas-tight with respect 

to the surroundings, 

in that means (18) are provided for generating a low 
pressure in this chamber, 
and in that devices (49, 34) are provided for forming a 
low-pressure atmosphere in the plasma state wherever the 

solder waves (40, 42) are produced. 
Soldering installation according to Claim 16, 
characterized in that gas-flow-inhibiting fittings (78, 

79) are provided between individual stations.
