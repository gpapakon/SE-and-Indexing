<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a differential sample and hold circuit including a voltage/current convertor (1) having two differential inputs (E1a, E1b) and two outputs (S1a, S1b). According to the invention, each of these outputs is linked by way of an input multiplexer module (2a) to two interposed follower/holder modules (5a, 6a), in such a way that at any instant one of the follower/holder modules (5a, 6a) operates in follower mode whilst the other (6a, 5a) operates in holder mode. These two modules (5a, 6a) are linked to the output (S4a) of the sample and hold circuit by way of an output multiplexer module (7a). This structure makes it possible to double the sampling frequency without increasing the intrinsic speed of this circuit. Each follower/holder module (5a, 6a) includes an input load (10a, 11a) linked in parallel with a capacitor (C18a, C19a), an output emitter/follower transistor (T20a, T21a) and an interrupt cell (5-6a). Thus, the high-frequency performance of the circuit is improved. Application to digital signal processing.

<CLAIMS>
A differential sample and hold circuit, characterized in that it is formed by
two parts comprising each at least one input multiplexer (2a, 2b), two interposed track-and-hold

modules (5a, 6a; 5b, 6b) and an output multiplexer (7a, 7b), said track-and-hold
modules including:


an input load (10a, 11a) permitting to control said track-and-hold modules in the
tracking mode or blocking mode, said input load being formed based on the collector-emitter

path of a transistor (T12a, T13a) whose base and collector are connected via a
resistor (R16a, R17a),

and a common switch cell (5-6a) to control the on or off mode of said transistors.
An analog to digital converter, characterized in that it comprises a
differential sample and hold circuit as claimed in claim 1.
A digital television receiver, characterized in that it comprises at least an
analog converter as claimed in claim 2.
