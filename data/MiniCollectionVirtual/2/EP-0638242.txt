<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a sterile milk, the calcium ion content being preferably decreased to half the natural amount by, for example, ion exchange or dialysis, and the milk then being sterile filtered and, if appropriate, calcium ions being added back up to the natural content. The product thus produced has all of the biological activities and virtually the original composition, but is free of bacteria, fungi and spores and can be kept for a relatively long period.

<CLAIMS>
A process for obtaining a sterile milk, characterised
in that calcium ions are removed from the milk and the

milk is then sterilised by filtration.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the milk is defatted before or after the removal of

calcium ions.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the calcium ions are bound to a solid support in

order to remove them.
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that
the calcium ions are bound to a cation exchanger.
A process according to claim 4, characterised in that
the calcium ions are bound to a polymer consisting of

a styrene-divinylbenzene matrix containing
aminomethylphosphonic acid groups, sodium form, or to

a polymer consisting of a styrene matrix containing
sulphonic acid groups, sodium form.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the calcium ions are removed from the milk by a

dialysis process.
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that
prior to the dialysis, the calcium ions are chelated

with citrate.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the calcium ion content is

decreased by at least one half, referred to the
natural content. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that calcium ions are again added to

the milk after the sterilisation by filtration.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that milk obtained from cows is

processed.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that milk obtained from humans is

processed.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that milk produced during the first 5

days after the delivery is processed.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that milk produced during the first

24 hours after the delivery is processed.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that milk is processed which at the

earliest has been obtained 5 days after the delivery.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that the sterilisation by filtration

is carried out using deep-bed filters or membrane
filters.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 15,
characterised in that filter aids are added during the

filtration.
