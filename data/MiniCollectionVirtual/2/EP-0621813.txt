<ABSTRACT>
Molten (M) is poured into a receiver (8, 28) designed to reduce fume and then out into an open area (P) via an outlet (9, 29) designed to cause the metal (M) to flow in a laminar flow. A hood (11) may be present above the receiver (8, 28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the suppression of fume arising during
pouring metal from a container in air or like atmosphere, for
example, to the suppression of fume arising when pouring liquid
iron from a torpedo or like container into a pond or lagoon at a
steelworks. The documents US-A-4546 907 and DE-B-1948 678 describe
methods and devices for pouring molten metal from a torpedo car
in a ladle.Liquid iron is transported in torpedoes on railways or roadways
at a steelworks from one work station to another, e.g. from an
iron making furnace to a steel making furnace. From time to time
there are hold-ups and it is not economic to keep the metal
liquid in the container until it can be accepted at the receiving
station. It is usual to move the torpedo to an open area called
a pond and to pour the liquid metal from the torpedo into the
pond where it solidifies; the solid metal is later broken up,
recovered and remelted when required or sold to third parties.
When the metal is poured into the pond it will oxidise on
exposure to the air and this creates vast quantities of fume,
mainly iron oxide, which is environmentally unacceptable. It is
one object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus
useful in the pouring of molten metal so that this problem is
reduced or eliminated. We have analysed the causes of the evolution of the fume and have established
that the main factor is the splashing which takes place when the liquid metal is
poured. We have discovered that if the molten metal is poured into a receiver as
indicated herein such fume as is evolved may be removed via a hood extraction
system or where the suppression is sufficiently good a hood system can be
dispensed with.According to the invention in one aspect there is provided a method of pouring
liquid metal from a container, the container being a torpedo or like container,
the method comprising pouring the metal from the container into a receiver
therefor and then causing the metal to pour through an outlet of the receiver,
characterised by positioning the outlet of the receiver whereby a height of liquid
metal is formed in the receiver before the liquid metal flows through the outlet
and the height of liquid metal is maintained in the receiver, causing the flow of
metal through the outlet to be substantially laminar and allowing the flow
through the outlet to form a pond or lagoon (P) with reduced evolution of fume
in an open area at a steelworks and allowing the liquid metal (M) in the pond or
lagoon to solidify.The outlet is most conveniently

<CLAIMS>
A method of pouring liquid metal from a container (T), the container
being a torpedo or like container, the method comprising pouring the metal

from the container (T) into a receiver (8, 28) therefor and then causing the
metal to pour through an outlet (9, 29) of the receiver, characterised by

positioning the outlet (9, 29) of the receiver (8, 28) whereby a height of liquid
metal is formed in the receiver before the liquid metal flows through the outlet

(9, 29) and the height of liquid metal is maintained in the receiver, causing the
flow of metal through the outlet to be substantially laminar and allowing the

flow through the outlet to form a pond or lagoon (P) with reduced evolution of
fume in an open area at a steelworks and allowing the liquid metal (M) in the

pond or lagoon to solidify.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the liquid flowing through the
outlet (9, 29) passes along a channel (17, 27) e.g. a launder, extending from

the outlet to the pond or lagoon (P).
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the channel is provided with an
overlying cover.
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, including the step of
surrounding the receiver (8, 28) with a gas which suppresses combustion. 
A method according to any preceding Claim, wherein the liquid metal
poured is iron and the fume arising includes particles of iron oxide.
A method according to any of Claims 1 to 5, including locating a hood
(11) over the receiver and connecting the hood (11) to a fume extraction system

(5).
A pour station (7, 27) for use as a receiver in the method of any
preceding claim, the pour station comprising a box shaped structure (8, 28)

having a floor and side walls, the structure being cast of refractory material,
characterised in that an outlet port (9, 29) is present in one side wall, the port

(9, 29) being sufficiently high up the side wall so that a bath of liquid metal
can be created in the box, whereby molten metal (M) poured into the box

enters liquid metal so reducing the generation of fume and may then be
caused to flow out of the box through the port (9, 29) in a laminar flow into an

open pond or lagoon at a steelworks.
A pour station according to Claim 7, including a channel (10, 30) in line
with the port (9, 29).
A pour station according to Claim 7 or 8, including a hood (11) located
over the pour station, the hood (11) being connected to a fume extraction

system (5). 
A pour station according to Claim 9, characterised in that the fume
extraction system comprises a baghouse (5) having a filter system and a fan,

the baghouse (5) being connected to an elongate duct (4) having longitudinally
spaced apart ports (6) which can be closed or connected in a gas tight manner

to the outlet of a fume extraction conduit (15, 17) the remote end of which
comprises the hood (11).
A pour station according to Claim 10, characterised in that the hood
(11) is connectable in turn to a series of spaced pour stations (7), and the fume

extraction conduit (15, 17) and the hood (11) are moveable together via
conduit (15, 17) and hood (11) whereby each pour station is connectable in

turn to a corresponding one of the ports (6) via a single conduit (15, 17) and
hood (11).
A pour station according to Claim 10 or 11, wherein the baghouse (5) is
replaced by a scrubber.
