A power transmission belt having a belt body with a length and 
laterally oppositely 

facing pulley engaging side surfaces. A first plurality of short fibers 
(28), made from a first 

material, is embedded in the belt body and extends substantially in a 
lateral direction. A 

second plurality of short fibers (30), made from a second material, is 
embedded in the belt 

body and extends substantially in a lateral direction. A plurality of 
the short fibers (28) made 

from the first material project laterally from at least one of the 
pulley engaging side surfaces on the belt body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power transmission belts and, more particularly, to a
power transmission belt having fibers protruding from pulley engaging side surfaces
thereon.When conventional power transmission belts are initially installed on a pulley
system, the belts are highly tensioned. The belts are thus pressed tightly against
cooperating pulleys. The belt rubber tends to stick to the pulley surfaces which accounts
for positive force transmission. However, the high frictional force between the belts and
pulleys also accounts for the generation of unwanted noise.
   It is known to embed short fibers in the V-shaped portion of a power transmission
belt. The fibers are oriented in a lateral direction to enhance lateral pressure resistance
on that part of the belt which contacts a cooperating pulley. These fibers are commonly
exposed at the laterally oppositely facing pulley engaging side surfaces so as to improve
wear resistance at the side surfaces of the belt.
   It is also known to embed short fibers in a power transmission belt and to have the
fibers protrude from the pulley engaging side surfaces on at least that portion of the belt
that frictionally engages a cooperating pulley. Protruding fibers reduce wear on the belt
side surfaces and also prevent sticking between the belt side surfaces and a cooperating
pulley to alleviate the aforementioned noise generation problem. It is also known to use short aramid fibers in that portion of the belt that is engaged
by a cooperating pulley. Aramid fibers exhibit excellent wear resistance. In Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 1-164839, aramid fibers are shown protruding from the pulley
engaging side surfaces on a power transmission belt to improve the durability thereof.
   When a belt with protruding aramid fibers is operated, the cooperating pulleys
cause the protruding portions of the aramid fibers to be bent against the side surfaces of
the belt The bent fibers then cover a significant portion of, if not the entire, side portion
of the belt which engages the cooperating pulleys in operation. The aramid fibers protect
the pulley engaging side surfaces of the belt from wear.
   In operation, the pulleys not only bend the exposed portions of the aramid fibers
but eventually embed the fibers into the rubber of the side surfaces. This embedding is
advantageous in terms of wear resistance in that the fibers remain intact for a long period
of time. However, in certain systems, this condition is undesirable.
   More particularly, in systems that utilize an
