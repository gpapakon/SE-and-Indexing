<ABSTRACT>
Improved proteinoid carriers and methods for their preparation and use as oral delivery systems for pharmaceutical agents are described. The proteinoid carriers are soluble within selected pH ranges within the gastrointestinal tract and display enhanced stability towards at least one of photolysis or decomposition over time. The proteinoid carriers are prepared from proteinoids having between 2 and 20 amino acids and having a molecular weight of between about 250 and 2400 daltons.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEINOID CARRIERS AND METHODSFOR PREPARATION AND USE THEREOFThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. applicr on serial no. 07/920,346, filed July 27, 1992, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application serial no. 07/898,909, filed June 15, 1992.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to proteinoids and proteinoid carriers made from them. The proteinoid carriers releasably encapsulate active agents and have extended longer shelf life ar1/or photostability. Methods for the preparation of such p.- --teinoid carriers are also disclosed.Background of the InventionThe available modes of delivery of pharmaceutical and therapeutic agents often are severely limited by chemical or physical barriers or both, which are imposed by the body. For example, oral delivery of many such agents would be the route of choice if not for the presence of chemical and physicochemical barriers such as extreme pH in the gut, exposure to powerful digestive enzymes, and impermeability of gastrointestinal membranes to the active ingredient. Among the numerous pharmaco¬ logical agents which are Known to be unsuitable for oral administration are biologically active pepuides and proteins, such as insulin. These agents are rapidly destroyed in the gut 

by acid hydrolysis and/or Joy proteolytic enzymes.A great deal of research has been devoted to developing effective oral drug delivery methods and systems for these vulnerable pharmacological agents. The proposed solutions have included :(a) co-administration of adjuvants (such as resorci- nols and non-ionic surfactants polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n- hexadecyl polyethylene ether to increase the permeability of the intestinal walls; and (b) co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors, such as pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and nrasylol to avoid enzymatic degradation.The use of such substances, in drug delivery systems, is limited however either ioecause of: (a) their inherent toxicicy when employed at effec¬ tive amounts;(b) their failure to protect the active ingredient or promote its absorption;(c) their adverse interaction with the drug. Liposomes as drug delivery systems have also been described. They provide a layer of lipid around the encapsulated pharmacological agent. The use of liposomes containing heparin is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,239,754 and several studies have been directed co the use of liposomes containing insulin; e.g., Patel et al. (1976) FEBS Letters Vol. 62, page 60 and Hashimoto et al. (1979)
