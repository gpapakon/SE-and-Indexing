<ABSTRACT>
A combinational weighing system receives articles sequentially 
in a plurality of mutually parallel supply lines to be 

sequentially transported to weighing devices which are 
individually associated therewith and weigh batches of the 

articles received therefrom. Combinations of the measured 
weight values are combined and a particular combination of 

article batches is selected as having a total weight which 
satisfies a predefined condition. The article batches in the 

selected combination are transported in a general direction of 
flow from the weighing devices to an outlet in mutually 

different travel modes such that they are automatically 
aligned one behind another in the direction of flow as they 

are discharged together through the outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to combinational measuring systems
and methods of carrying out combinational calculations on the
weights of batches of fragile articles produced in a specified
shape such as potato chips and biscuits while they are being
transported in aligned formations, and discharging them being
together in an aligned formation.There have been known combinational weighing systems (see, for instance, EP-A-0 195 428 or EP-A-0 061 321) of the
type adapted to open a plurality of pool hoppers which receive
article batches and drop them into weigh hoppers disposed
below, to measure the weight of each article batch by a load
cell, to carry out combinational calculations of the weighed
values inputted from the individual load cells by using a
microcomputer and to compare the results of these calculations
with a target weight value in order to select a combination
with the total weight value which is close to the target
weight value and also within a specified allowable range.Recently, snack foods such as potato chips produced in the
same shape or big-sized biscuits are frequently packaged and
sold inside a cylindrical box in a mutually overlapping,
neatly aligned arrangement, but combinational weighing systems
of the type described above cannot be used in a production
line for such products because fragile articles like potato
chips and biscuits are easily broken or cracked when they are
dropped, for example, from a pool hopper to a weigh hopper.
Moreover, combinational weighing systems of the type described
above are not adapted to discharge weighed articles in a 
neatly aligned formation, and hence the articles from the
selected combination cannot be easily packaged inside a box.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
a combinational measuring system capable of discharging snack
foods in the same form such as uniformly shaped potato chips
and biscuits in an aligned formation while carrying out
combinational weighing such that they can be packaged easily.A combinational measuring system according to the present
invention, with which the above and other objects can be
accomplished, may be characterized as comprising a supply
device with a plurality of mutually parallel supply lines for
sequentially transporting articles to be weighed, a plurality
of weighing devices individually associated with these supply
lines and each serving to weigh article batches sequentially
and discharging them to a discharge device for transporting
them from the weighing devices to a discharge outlet,
