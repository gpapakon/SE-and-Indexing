<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for on-line monitoring the presence of a 
corrosive constituent in a petroleum product feedstream is disclosed, 

in which change in reflected radiation detected from a metal standard 
in the feedstream indicates said presence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The corrosion of metal equipment by petroleum products is
controlled by limiting the corrosivity of the product. In practice,
either the level of certain impurities is specified or the degree of
corrosion of a specific metal which is allowable under standardized
test conditions is specified. The Copper Strip Corrosion Test is such
an example. Copper is chosen because it is the most corrosion sensitive
metal to be encountered by most petroleum products. In many
cases sulfur containing species such as hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans,
organic sulfides, carbonyl sulfide and even elemental sulfur are of
prime concern.In the case of the Copper Strip Corrosion Test for liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG), a freshly polished piece of copper is immersed in
a sealed pressure bomb containing 100 ml of LPG for 1 hour at 38Â°C.
After removal the copper is inspected visually for any tarnish and
compared to a standard color chart available from the ASTM. Depending
on the degree of tarnish, the LPG is then assigned a grade ranging
from 1 to 4, the former indicating essentially no tarnish, and the
latter indicating severe tarnish (essentially black) . In most situations
only grade 1 LPG is used commercially. The exact specifications
for this test can be found in ASTM test designation No. D 1838-84.
Similar test specifications are available from the ASTM for other
products such as jet fuel, for example.The test is clearly laborious, time consuming, imprecise and
dependent upon an operators visual judgment. Furthermore, the scientific
reasons for the formation of the colors listed in the ASTM
specification have not been explained before.It is the purpose of this invention to provide for a method
and an instrument to automate and help quantify the Copper Strip
Corrosion Test for petroleum products as practiced in a typical 
refinery laboratory. In addition, it is a purpose of this invention
to provide a means for carrying out corrosivity testing on-line as the
petroleum product is being produced or shipped via a pipeline, for
example.The present invention provides, in one aspect, a method for
on-line monitoring a petroleum stream for the presence therein of a
corrosive constituent, comprising:
(a) locating a metal in the stream, the metal being one that
reacts with said corrosive constituent to form an optically
transparent film on the metal;(b) irradiating the metal;(c) detecting reflected radiation from said metal;(d) converting said reflected radiation to an electrical
signal indicative of the magnitude of the reflected

<CLAIMS>
A method for on-line monitoring a petroleum stream for
the presence therein of a corrosive constituent, comprising:


(a) locating a metal in the stream, the metal being one that
reacts with said corrosive constituent to form an optically

transparent film on the metal;
(b) irradiating the metal;
(c) detecting reflected radiation from said metal;
(d) converting said reflected radiation to an electrical
signal indicative of the magnitude of the reflected radiation;
(e) repeating steps (b), (c), and (d) to obtain the change
in reflectivity over a period of time;
(f)
and relating the change to the

level of said corrosive constituent in said stream.
The method of claim 1, wherein step (e) and step (f) are
conducted continuously.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said corrosive
constituent includes sulfur or sulfur compounds.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said metal is, or
includes, copper. 
A system suitable for use in the method claimed in any
preceding claim for determining the presence of a corrosive constituent in a

petroleum stream; which system comprises in combination :

(a) a housing having valves for admitting and releasing said
petroleum stream;
(b) a source of visible or infra-red light;
(c) a metal selected to react with the said corrosive constituent
in the petroleum stream to form an optically transparent film on the metal;
(d) means for irradiating said metal with said light;
(e) means for detecting the reflected light from said metal over
a period of time;
(f) means for converting said reflected light into an electrical
signal over a period of time, the change in which signal is relatable to the level of said

corrosive constituent in said petroleum stream.
The system of claim 5, wherein said converting means (f) is
capable of providing a continuous signal.
The system of claim 5 or claim 6, further including means to
control the temperature of said housing.
The system of any one of claim 5 to 7, wherein said means
for irradiating and for detecting are fiber optic means.
The system of any one of claims 5 to 8, wherein said means
for irradiating and for detecting are the same means. 
The system of any one of claims 5 to 9, wherein said metal is
in the form of a metal thin film or metal coupon.
The system of any one of claims 5 to 10, wherein the metal
is, or includes, copper.
The system of any one of claims 5 to 10, further including
means to record said electrical signals, comprising a strip chart recorder or a

computer having a data acquisition card.
