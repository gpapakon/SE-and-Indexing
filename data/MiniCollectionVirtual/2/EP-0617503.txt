<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device (36) for controlling the operating point (AP1,AP2) of a series tuned-circuit invertor (6 to 14). According to the invention, the frequency (f) of the invertor (10) is controlled as the control variable as a function of a specific phase-angle control difference ( phi e) in such a manner that a detected actual phase angle value ( phi Z) of a state variable (Z, i, uc), which can be measured, of the load circuit (12,14) and whose phase response runs monotonally in a falling manner corresponds to a required phase angle value ( phi 
<
*
>
) which can be predetermined. A method and a device (36) are thus obtained for controlling the operating point (AP1,AP2) of a series tuned-circuit invertor (6 to 14), by means of which the specified operating range (A) for the tuned-circuit invertor can be detected and stabilised irrespective of parameter fluctuations of the tuned-circuit elements.

Method for controlling the working points 
(AP1, AP2) of a series-resonant-circuit inverter (6 to 

14), whereby the frequency (f) of the inverter (10) is
