<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition as well as a printed 
circuit board using the same are disclosed. The resin 

composition is formed by dispersing powder of a cured 
heat-resistant resin powder soluble in acid or oxidizing 

agent into a matrix of an uncured photosensitive resin 
hardly soluble in acid or oxidizing agent, in which a 

coloring matter is added to the resin matrix and/or the 
heat-resistant resin powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition 
and a printed circuit board using the same, and more 
particularly to a resin composition capable of providing 
a printed circuit board having improved appearance and 
color tone. As a method of producing a printed circuit 
board, there is an additive method. This additive 
method is a method wherein an adhesive for electroless 
plating is applied onto an insulating substrate of 
glass-epoxy resin or the like to form an adhesive layer, 
and the surface of the adhesive layer is roughened, and 
a plated resist is formed on the roughened surface, and 
then a metal for conductor circuit is adhered thereto 
through electroless plating. According to this method, the conductor 
circuit is adhered to the roughened adhesive layer 
through plating or the like, so that an excellent 
joining property can be ensured therebetween to prepare 
a printed circuit board having an excellent reliability.  
 Therefore, the adhesive for electroless 
plating used in the above method is necessary to have a 
function that the surface after the curing can be 
roughened. For this purpose, there is adopted an 
adhesive formed by adding a soluble filler to an epoxy 
resin as a resin matrix (see JP-A-5-18476). Such an 
adhesive made from the epoxy resin is excellent in the 
heat resistance as compared with an adhesive made from 
rubber or the like and can improve the heat resistance 
of a printed circuit board. Furthermore, there is proposed a 
photosensitive resin composition formed by giving a 
photosensitive group to the epoxy resin as the resin 
matrix (see JP-A-4-55555). When using such a 
composition, the occurrence of strain cracking produced 
in the heat-curing of the adhesive is effectively 
prevented by the curing through light exposure, or the 
formation of via-hole on an interlaminar insulating 
layer in a so-called build-up multi-layer printed 
circuit board suitable for high densification can easily 
be made by light exposure and development. However, the aforementioned epoxy resin or 
photosensitive resin composition has a light 
permeability, so that when it is used as a resin matrix 
of an adhesive for electroless plating, an internal 
circuit can be seen from exterior and hence an 
appearance and a color tone of the printed circuit board  
 
are undesirably degraded. For this end, the adjustment of color tone in 
the printed circuit board has hitherto been carried out 
by a so-called solder resist process in which a colored 
solder resist is printed on the printed
