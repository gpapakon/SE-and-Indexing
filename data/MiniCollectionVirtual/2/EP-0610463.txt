<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to the field of equipment 
power supplies and more specifically to portable equipment 
having both externally provided operative power and battery pack 
provided operative power with battery charging capability. Portable equipment is often provided operative power from 
power packs constructed of primary batteries or secondary batteries. 
If the equipment is in a location with fixed power available, the 
equipment may be provided operative power by an external power 
source. Simultaneously with providing operative power from the 
external power source it is also desirable to charge the secondary 
batteries, if they are disposed in the power pack. If primary 
batteries are disposed in the power pack the external power source 
must not attempt to charge these batteries. This is because primary 
batteries can be irreversibly damaged and in some cases may 
explode, if there is an attempt to charge these primary batteries. Prior solutions to this problem have either warned the user not 
to install primary batteries when external power is connected, or 
used mechanically interlocked power receptacles. These 
mechanically interlocked power receptacles connect the external 
power to the load while disconnecting the battery power from the 
load. The problem with this approach is that the disconnect 
mechanism is subject to physical wear and further is very difficult 
to seal. Without an adequate seal the electrical circuitry internal to 
the portable equipment can be damaged. Further, with this 
approach, if secondary batteries are installed they will not be  
 
charged simultaneously with the external power source providing operative 
power. EP-A-0 394 074 describes a method and apparatus for determining 
battery type and modifying operational characteristics in response thereto. What is needed is an improved portable equipment power supply with 
provision for externally provided power to provide operative power while 
charging a secondary battery power pack but preventing the charging of a 
primary battery pack. According to the invention there is provided a power supply with a 
battery disconnect comprising: battery power terminal means, including 
separate positive, negative and charging terminals, said battery power 
terminal means for receiving battery power from a to be provided battery, 
external power terminal means for receiving external power from a to be 
provided external power source, charging means for providing a charge 
path between said external power

A power supply with a battery disconnect comprising: 

battery power terminal means, including separate positive (105), 
negative (109) and charging (121) terminals, said battery power terminal 

means for receiving battery power from a to be provided battery (111, 
119), external power terminal means (103, 107) for receiving external 

power from a to be provided external power source (115), charging 

means (137) for providing a charge path between said external power 
terminal means (103, 107) and the charging terminal (121) of said battery 

power terminal means, characterised by: 
gating means (113) having an input (123), an output (125), and a 
control input (127), wherein the input (123) is coupled to said external 

power terminal means, the output (125) is coupled to one of the positive 
(105) and negative (109) terminals of said battery power terminal means, 

and the control input (127) is coupled to said external power terminal 
means (103, 107), and wherein the output (125) is decoupled from the 

input (123) responsive to connection of the external power source (115) to 
the external power terminal means (103, 107) and wherein the output 

(125) is coupled to the input (123), responsive to the disconnection of the 
external power source (115) from the external power terminal means 

(103, 107); and 
means (131, 129) for combining the battery power terminal means 
(105, 109, 121), the external power terminal means (103, 107), and the 

input (123) of said gating means (113), said combining means (131, 129) 
for providing operative power to a load (101) from either the external 

power source (115) through said external power terminal means (103, 
107), or the battery (111, 119) through said battery power terminal means 

(105, 109, 121) and the input (123) of said gating means (113), and 
wherein said charging means (137) permits the charging of a secondary 

battery (119) coupled to the charging terminal (121) and at least another 
one of the positive (105) and negative (109) terminals of said battery 

power terminal means (105, 109, 121), responsive to the connection of the 
external power source (115), and wherein said gating means (113) 

prevents the charging of a primary battery (111) connected to the positive 
(105) and negative (109) terminals of said battery power terminal means 

(105, 109, 121), by disconnecting the input (123) and output (125) of said  
 

gating means (113) responsive to the connection of the external power 
source (115) to said external power terminal means (103, 107). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said means 
for combining (131, 129) includes means for isolating (117) the control 

input (123) of said gating means (113) from said battery power terminal 
means (105, 109, 121). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 2 wherein said means 
for isolating (117) comprises a semiconductor diode (117). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 wherein said gating 
means (113) comprises a transistor (205). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 4 wherein said 
transistor (205) is cut-off in response to the connection of the external 

power source (115), thereby decoupling the input (123) of the gating 
means (113) from the output (125) of the gating means (113) and 

electrically disconnecting the battery power terminal means (105, 109, 
121) from the load (101), by providing a high resistance path between the 

battery power terminal means (105, 109, 121) and the load (101). 
An apparatus in accordance with claim 1 enclosed in a sealed 
housing (100), wherein the battery power terminal means (105, 109, 121), 

and the external power terminal means (103, 107) are provided external 
to said sealed housing (100).
