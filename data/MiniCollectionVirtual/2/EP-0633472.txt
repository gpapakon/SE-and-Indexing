<ABSTRACT>
A method for immunoassay of a viral antigen is 
performed on a membrane precoated with an inert 

protein. Nonimmunological capture of antigen takes 
place by absorption onto the coated membrane. 

Captured antigen binds to a tracer which includes a 
label conjugated to a specific antibody, the inert 

protein concomitantly inhibiting nonspecific binding 
of tracer. The label may be an enzyme which converts 

a substrate to a detectable product or converts a 
blocked inhibitor to an inhibitor whereby a second 

enzyme is inhibited from converting a substrate to a 
product. The invention includes a kit of materials 

for performing an assay in accordance with the method 
of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention. This invention
relates to assay for a viral antigen and,
   more particularly, relates to an assay including
capture of the viral antigen directly on a membrane
precoated with an inert protein.2. Background of the Invention. A variety of
assay systems which are both rapid and sensitive has
been developed to detect or determine the
concentration of a ligand in a liquid. Conventional
immunoassays depend on the binding of the ligand to a
specific antiligand, and have been particularly useful
because they give high levels of specificity and
sensitivity. These assays generally employ one of the
above reagents in labeled form, the labeled reagent
often being referred to as the tracer.Various means for labeling have been developed.
Radioimmunoassay (RIA) procedures use radioisotopes as
labels, provide high levels of sensitivity and
reproducibility, and are amenable to automation for
rapid processing of large numbers of samples.
Fluoroimmunoassay (FIA) uses fluorochromes as labels,
and provides direct detection of the label by exciting
the dye with excitation radiation of appropriate
wavelength and detecting fluorescence therefrom.Enzymes have also been used as labels in
immunoassay. In enzyme immunoassay (EIA), the enzyme 
labeled reagents are cheap to prepare and are highly
stable thus giving a long shelf life, yet yield assays
which approach the sensitivity of radioimmunoassay and
which give objective results that can be determined
either visually or with rather simple equipment, such
as a spectrophotometer.In conventional EIA, an enzyme is covalently
conjugated with one component of a specifically
binding antigen-antibody pair, and the resulting
enzyme conjugate is reacted with a substrate to
produce a color which is measured. Often, an
unconjugated component, such as an antibody is
immobilized on a solid support and serves to capture
antigen in a specific binding reaction.
Representative of such conventional EIA is U.S. Patent
No. 3,654,090.U.S. Patent No. 4,588,680
discloses assay for the M protein of various viruses,
including Influenza A,B and C viruses. The assay
includes disruption of the virus to release the M
protein which is absorbed directly onto a polymeric
support.WO 86/02733 discloses
assay for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in which
antigenic glycoproteins gA/B, gC and gD are absorbed
directly onto a polymeric, support or captured by
specific monoclonal antibodies on the support.Sankolli et al. in Journal of Immunological

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining a viral antigen
in a liquid comprising:


a) combining a first liquid suspected of
containing a viral antigen with a membrane coated with

an inert protein and with an antibody specific for
said antigen having a first hydrolase conjugated

thereto whereby said viral antigen attaches to said
coated membrane and binds to said antibody to give a

bound fraction including said first hydrolase on said
membrane;
b) separating said membrane from said first
liquid by causing said first liquid to pass through

said membrane;
c) contacting said coated membrane with a
second liquid containing a blocked inhibitor, a second

hydrolase substantially unreactive toward said blocked
inhibitor and a substrate for said second hydrolase

whereby said first hydrolase on said support converts
said blocked inhibitor to an inhibitor which inhibits

conversion of said substrate to a colored product by
said second hydrolase; and
d) detecting said viral antigen by a signal

associated with the color of said product.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said inert
protein is selected from the group consisting of

casein and albumin.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said first
hydrolase is selected from the group consisting of a

peptidase, esterase, phosphatase and glycosidase.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said
blocked inhibitor is a blocked fluoroketone. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said second hydrolase is an esterase.
The method of claim 5 wherein said substrate is an indolyl ester.
A kit of materials for performing an assay for a viral antigen as defined in claims 1-6,
wherein said kit comprises a membrane coated with an inert protein, an antibody

having a first hydrolase conjugated thereto, a blocked inhibitor as a substrate for said
first hydrolase and a housing containing an absorbent material positioned adjacent

said membrane.
The kit of claim 7 further comprising at least one other reagent selected from a
second hydrolase, an enzyme substrate for said second hydrolase, buffer and saline.
