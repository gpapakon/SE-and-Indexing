<ABSTRACT>
In order, in a burner (1), particularly for rotary furnaces, with at least one fuel channel (2; 3; 5) for solid, gaseous and/or liquid fuels, to carry out an operational setting of the flame form within a wide range and allow a homogeneous mixing of the air with the fuel along with low flow losses, there is proposed, in the primary-air channel (6), a swirl-generating device (15) consisting of a plurality of flexible tubes (8) which are arranged approximately in the direction of flow (6a) of the primary air and rotationally symmetrically about the burner axis (1'). The tubes (8), in their flow entry region (8'), are clamped in an adjusting ring (9) mounted rotatably about the burner axis (1') and, in their flow exit region (8''), are secured against rotation about the burner axis (1') by fastening means (14). The rotation of the adjusting ring (9), preferably via a displacement slot (17), results in a helical twisting of the flexible tubes (8) about the burner axis (1'), with the result that a swirl is imparted to the primary air.
