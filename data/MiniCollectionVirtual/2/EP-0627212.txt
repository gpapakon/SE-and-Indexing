<ABSTRACT>
In addition to the usual ingredients, this varnish contains (a) from 10 to 59% by weight of a film-forming polymer which is present in the dispersed state, (b) from 0.01 to 1% by weight of a water-soluble perfluoroalkyl compound, the alkyl radical of which has from 3 to 32 carbon atoms, and (c) from 40 to 90% by weight of water, the proportions of (a), (b) and (c) being expressed relative to the total weight of the varnish. The presence of the water-soluble perfluoroalkyl compound makes it possible to obtain excellent aqueous nail varnishes which are, in particular, enhanced in their spreading on the surface of the nails.

Coloured or colourless, aqueous nail varnish 
characterized in that in addition to the usual ingredients 

it contains (a) from 10 to 59 % by weight of a 
film-forming polymer present in the dispersed state, 

(b) from 0.01 to 1 % by weight of a water-soluble perfluoroalkyl 
compound in which the alkyl radical contains 

from 3 to 32 carbon atoms, and (c) from 40 to 90 % by 
weight of water, the proportions of (a), (b) and (c) 

being expressed in relation to the total weight of the 
varnish, the said perfluoroalkyl compound corresponding
