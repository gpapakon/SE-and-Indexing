<ABSTRACT>
A fiber identifer for detecting the presence or 
absence of an active data signal or a test signal in an 

optical fiber. The instrument includes a piston (46) which 
positions a portion of the fiber under test against an 

optical detector (42), the piston being located within a 
housing (50), and the housing being attached to a drive rod (52). 

The rod is responsive to a levered actuation mechanism (60), 
but a damper controls the movement rate of the rod, and 

hence the piston, to slowly bend the fiber, minimizing 
disruption of any signal flowing through the fiber and 

preventing undue mechanical stress which could damage the 
fiber. A precision spring (68) within the housing is used to 

limit the pressure applied by the piston against the 
optical fiber. The housing includes a novel 

arrangement of electrical contacts to sense the position 
of the piston and, indirectly, the position of the rod.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
devices for testing communications equipment, and more 
particularly to a device for testing the operation of an 
optical fiber which may be carrying an active signal. In recent years, fiber optic cables have 
replaced traditional copper wire as the preferred medium 
for telecommunications. Although optical fibers have 
certain advantages over copper wire, they are still 
subject to faults (which may result during installation 
or from environmental factors after installation), and 
may also accidentally be "miswired," i.e., improperly 
routed to or from the optical transmitters and receivers. 
For these and other reasons, it is often necessary to 
identify one particular fiber out of a large group of 
such fibers carried in a common cable. Identification of a particular optical fiber is 
an inherently difficult task, since direct connection of 
the fiber to an optical detector would require cutting 
the fiber, which is highly undesirable. First of all, 
the fibers being tested are often active, and cutting the 
fiber would lead to an enormous data loss. Also, a cut 
fiber must be reconnected by the use of an optical splice 
which attenuates the communication signals and can create 
interfering reflections. Furthermore, since a trial-and-error 
method must often be used to pinpoint the 
particular fiber, this could result in literally dozens 
of cut fibers and splice assemblies. Color-coding the 
outer buffer of the fibers is insufficient where a large 
number of fibers are present, or where the records of the 
color-coding are incorrect. Fortunately, a technique has 
been devised for detecting test signals being carried on 
an optical fiber without the need of cutting the fiber.  
 This technique relates to the manner in which a 
portion of the transmitted light "leaks" out at 
microbends in the fiber. The degree to which the fiber 
must be bent in order to obtain such leakage is a 
function of the relative indices of refraction between 
the fiber core and its cladding, and between the cladding 
and the outer buffer. In U.S. Patent Nos. 4,728,169 and 
4,790,617 (both issued to Campbell et al.), this 
principle is used to optimize the alignment of two fibers 
which are to be spliced together. Those patents describe 
a manner of injecting light into the fiber as well as 
withdrawing a portion of the light. In U.S. Patent No. 4,759,605 issued to Shen et 
al., this same principle is used to extract light from a 
fiber without cutting the fiber. The device
