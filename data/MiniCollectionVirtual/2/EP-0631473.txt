<ABSTRACT>
Water dispersible granules are prepared that contain low melting point pesticides and which are prepared by milling the pesticides with a first portion of finely divided filler and blending the milled mixture with a second portion of finely divided filler, wetting the blend with water and then forming granules from the wetted blend.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water dispersible 
granules for the delivery of biologically active 
substances for agricultural use. More particularly 
it relates to granules comprising biologically 
active substances that have low melting points. Water dispersible granules (WG), also known 
as dry flowables, have recently become a widely 
accepted form for a range of biologically active 
agents, and in particular for pesticides. Water dispersible granules consist of small 
granules typically 0.1 to 3mm in size and preferably 
of uniform size range and which are free flowing, 
low dusting and disperse in water to form a 
homogenous suspension of particles that are 
substantially smaller than that of the granules. 
The granules can be measured volumetrically which  
 
enables the end user to conveniently measure the 
desired amount of product for addition to a 
spray tank. Typically, water dispersible granules 
comprise an active agent, a filler (also referred to 
as diluent) and surface active agents (which term 
may include a dispersant and a wetting agent). The 
relative amounts of individual ingredients may vary 
widely, with the active agent generally being 
present in an amount from 10 to 95% w/w, the filler 
in an amount from 5 to 80% w/w and the surface 
active agent in an amount from 0.1 to 20% w/w. The conventional process for preparing water 
dispersible granules consists of a preliminary step 
of forming a wettable powder by blending the 
ingredients, active agents, filler and surface 
active agent, and milling them to provide the 
desired particle size. The wettable powder is then 
subsequently formed into granules by a range of 
techniques including agglomeration and extrusion or 
spray drying in each case after the addition of 
water and optionally binding agents. Examples of such processes are described by 
D A Hovde in the paper entitled "Laboratory 
Development and Evaluation of Water Dispersible 
Granules" presented at : ASTM E-35.22 Symposium on 
Pesticide Formulations and Application Systems: 
Third Symposium, October 11-14 1982, Fort Mitchell, 
Kentucky. While such processes are generally 
acceptable, it is not always possible to achieve 
good dispersibility with all formulations especially 
with compositions where the active agent is a low 
melting point solid of low water solubility. In 
such cases we have found that, while the 
intermediate wettable powder may disperse 
adequately, the resulting granule does not.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing water dispersible 
granules comprising a biologically active substance 

that has a low melting point, the process comprising 
milling the active substance with a first portion of 

a finely divided filler to give a finely divided 
mixture and then blending a second portion of a 

finely divided filler and a surfactant 
with said finely divided mixture, wetting the 

blend with water and then granulating the blend. 
A process as defined in claim 1 wherein the 
active substance has a melting point less than 100°C 

and a water solubility less than 100mg/litre at 
25°C. 
A process as defined in any one of claims 1 
to 2 wherein the granules comprise 5-75% w/w 

biologically active substance, 25-90% ww of a finely 
divided filler and 5-15% w/w of a surfactant 

component and wherein during the milling stage 
20-80% of the filler component is present. 
A process as defined in any one of claims 1 
to 3 wherein the concentration of biologically 

active substance in the premix is at least 1.5 times 
that of the concentration of the biologically active 

substance in the final granule. 
A process as defined in any one claims 1 to 4 
wherein the particle size of the mixture after the 

milling stage is less than 50 µm and more 
preferably less than 10 µm. 
A process as defined in any one of claims 1 
to 5 wherein the granulation process uses a 

relatively low pressure extruder to extrude the 
wetted blend as a low compact extrudate that can be 

broken down by a gentle rolling or tumbling action 
to form rounded granules which may be subsequently 

dried.
