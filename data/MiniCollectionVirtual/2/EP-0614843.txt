<ABSTRACT>
Drive mechanism for a self-propelled elevator cabin, with a drive unit 2 which permits lifting and lowering of the cabin 1 via hoist discs 3 with spiral grooves in engagement with fixed rollers 4. The hoist discs 3 have the shape of obtuse-angled conical discs, on the circumferential surface of which spiral grooves in engagement with the fixed rollers 4 are formed. The rotating hoist discs 3, depending on the direction of rotation, cause the rollers 4 running in the spiral grooves to run to the inside or the outside on the hoist disc 3. The pitch "X" of the spiral groove thus produces the corresponding vertical movement of the cabin 1 per revolution of the hoist disc 3. The conical form of the hoist disc 3 results in the requisite effect that only one half of the hoist disc 3 is in contact with the fixed rollers 4. The rollers 4 are arranged at a distance "X", corresponding to the pitch of the spiral groove, in a line on a girder section 5 in the lift shaft. The rollers 4 arranged in a row at the same time serve as guide rails by U-sections fastened to the cabin 1 being used as guide shoes 8.

Drive device of an automatic lift cage, for the purpose of 
rectilinear advancing movement by means of relative movement between 

constrainedly guided rollers and inclined grooves, wherein a part of 
the device serves as guide for the cage, characterised thereby that a 

hoisting pulley (3) driven by a drive unit (2) at a lift cage (1) 
stands in engagement with fixed rollers (4), a spiral groove (3.2) 

effecting raising movement or lowering movement of the cage in 
dependence on rotational direction during rotation of the hoisting 

pulley (3) is present and the spiral groove (3.2) is shaped on the 
envelope surface of a cone pulley (3.1). 
Drive device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the axis of the housing pulley (3) has an angle "a", which forms a 

parallelism of the cone flank with the part of the spiral groove 
(3.2) standing in engagement with the rollers (4), relative to the 

horizontal. 
Drive device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the spiral groove (3.1) has at least one revolution. 
Drive device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the intermediate space "Z" between adjacent spiral groove outer walls 

is dimensioned to be the same size as the groove width of the spiral 
groove (3.2). 
Drive device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that 
the intermediate space "Z" between adjacent spiral groove outer walls 

is dimensioned to be of different size from the groove width of the 
spiral groove (3.2). 
Drive device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the rollers (4) are arranged on a support profile section (5) at 

spacings corresponding to the inclination "X" of the spiral groove 
(3.2).  

 
Drive device according to claim 1 and 6, characterised thereby 
that the roller pins (4.1) have a convex end face (4.3) which 

projects relative to the roller circumference (4.2). 
Drive device according to claim 1 and 6, characterised thereby 
that the roller pins (4.1) have at the end a roller ball (4.4) which 

projects relative to the roller circumference (4.2). 
Drive device according to claim 1 and 6, characterised thereby 
that rollers (4) are arranged in pairs with a mutual spacing which 

corresponds to the groove wall thickness of the spiral groove (3.2) 
and the roller pairs are arranged with a spacing relative to one 

another which corresponds to the inclination "X" of the spiral groove 
(3.2). 
Drive device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
guide shoes (8) are present, which guide the cage in the horizontal 

plane and each embrace at least two successive rollers. 
Drive device according to claim 1 and 10, characterised thereby 
that the guide shoes (8) have bevelled inlet and outlet openings.
