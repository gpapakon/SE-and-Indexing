<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an infant seat, comprising a portable 
bucket seat body having a rocker bottom (2), 

an auxiliary support (11) being 
provided, that is mounted to be moved from an inoperative position in 

which it is sunk into the plane of the bottom, towards an operative 
position in which it slopes rearwardly and downwardly from the bottom 

plane. According to the invention the U-shaped auxiliary support (11) is 
mounted with the free ends of the support 

legs about a transverse axis (12) 
for a downward swinging movement, a locking device being provided, 

adapted to be actuated at the top behind the backwall of the bucket-shaped 
seat to lock the auxiliary support (11) in its active and inactive 

positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an infant seat, as defined in the first 
part of claim 1. When placed on a flat support surface - with the auxiliary 
support in its inoperative position - such a seat may roll with its 
curved bottom on the support surface and thus perform a rocking motion 
about a substantially lying mid position. Moving the auxiliary support 
towards its operative position brings the seat in a rather upright 
position, in which it is supported in a stable manner - with the 
forward part of the bottom and the rear free end of the auxiliary 
support resting on the support surface. In a well-known embodiment the auxiliary support is formed by a 
substantially U-shaped member that is slidably movable in its plane 
from a forward retracted position rearwardly into an extended 
position. Pulling the auxiliary support into the extended position and 
pushing it back into the forward retracted position respectively is 
rather difficult and causes inconvenience to the child in the seat. 
For the seat has to be tilted forwardly for seizing the auxiliary 
support under the bottom. The invention aims at removing this drawback of the well-known 
seat. In accordance with the invention this aim is achieved in that 
the U-shaped auxiliary support is mounted with the free ends of its 
legs about a transverse axis for a downward swinging movement, said 
axis being located adjacent the centre of the rocker bottom, a 
locking device being provided, adapted to be actuated at the top 
behind the backwall of the bucket-shaped seat to lock the auxiliary 
support in its active and inactive positions. With an infant seat performed in accordance with the present 
invention, the seat needs to be lifted at its backside only to a small 
extant - corresponding with the desired more upward and stable sitting 
position - from the support surface to cause the auxiliary support to 
swing down into its operative position. The lifting of the seat and 
the unlocking of the auxiliary support may take place in one single 
action. It is to be noted that EP-A-0218444 discloses an infant seat, 
comprising a bucket seat body with two sidewalls, a bottom, a seat and 
an inclined backwall and a pivotally connected carrying handle, with 
which there is also an auxiliary support that is pivotally mounted  
 
about a transverse axis. In this case the transverse axis is located 
at the rearward end of the bottom of the seat which bottom extends 
- as seen in the rearward direction - only slightly beyond the 
position of the transverse

<CLAIMS>
An infant seat, comprising a portable bucket seat body, having 
two sidewalls with curved lower edges (2) to define a rocker bottom, a 

seat and an inclined backwall (4) extending between said sidewalls and 
a carrying handle (5) which is pivotally connected to said sidewalls 

about a transverse axis that is located at a distance above the center 
of the rocker bottom (2), a generally U-shaped auxiliary support (11) 

being provided, that is mounted to be moved from an inoperative 
position in which it is sunk into the plane of the rocker bottom (2), 

towards an operative position in which it slopes rearwardly and 
downwardly from the rocker bottom plane, characterized in that the U-shaped 

auxiliary support (11) is mounted with the free ends of its 
support legs (11a) about a transverse axis (12) for a downward 

swinging movement, said axis (12) being located adjacent the centre of 
the rocker bottom (2), a locking device (13, 13a-c, 14-21) being 

provided, adapted to be actuated at the top behind the backwall (4) of 
the bucket-shaped seat to lock the auxiliary support (11) in its 

active and inactive positions. 
An infant seat according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
pivot axis (12) of the auxiliary support (11) is positioned slightly 

rearwardly of the center of the rocker bottom. 
An infant seat according to claims 1-2, characterized by a 
locking projection (13) extending upwardly from the upper side of the 

support legs (11a), adapted to engage - in at least two selective 
positions corresponding with the inoperative and the operative 

position of the auxiliary support (11) respectively - a complementary 
locking projection (14) provided on a sliding lock (17) that is 

reciprocatingly guided in the plane of symmetry of the seat, along the 
lower side of the backwall (4) of the seat. 
An infant seat according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
locking projection (13) on the support legs (11a) is provided with at 

least two locking seats (13a-13c) adapted to selectively engage the 
complementary locking projection (14) on the sliding lock. 
An infant seat according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
complementary locking projections (14) are each connected to the 

sliding lock (17) by means of a cross piece (16) and an arm (15) 
suspending from an end thereof. 
An infant seat according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
sliding lock (17) is mounted to be movable into the unlocked position 

against spring action (21).
