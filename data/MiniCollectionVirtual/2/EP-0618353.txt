<ABSTRACT>
A heater unit comprising (1) a honeycomb heater (12) 
comprising (a) a metallic honeycomb structure (10) having a large 

number of passages parallel to the direction of a gas flowing 
through the heater unit and (b) at least one electrode (22) 

for electrification of the honeycomb structure (10), attached to 
the honeycomb structure (10), and (2) a metallic casing (19) for 

holding the honeycomb heater (1) therein via at least one 
metallic supporting member (14,15), in which heater unit an insulation 

portion (17) is provided at least either at the connection 
area (21) where the honeycomb heater and the supporting member (14,15) 

are connected or at the connection area where the supporting 
member and the casing are connected, and the supporting 

member (14,15) has such a structure as to be able to absorb the 
displacement of the honeycomb heater which appears in a 

direction substantially perpendicular to said gas flow 
direction, and has a function of fixing the honeycomb heater 

against its displacement which appears in the gas flow 
direction. The heater unit, when exposed to severe driving 

conditions of automobiles, etc. and subjected to vibration 
and the expansion and contraction caused by thermal shock, 

gives rise to neither breakage of honeycomb heater nor peeling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heater unit which can be suitably used for purification of automotive exhaust
gases, etc.In addition to hitherto known porous ceramic honeycomb structures, metallic honeycomb structures have recently
drawn attention as a catalyst, a catalyst carrier or the like for conversion of the nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide
(CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) contained in the exhaust gases discharged from the internal combustion engines of
automobiles, etc.Meanwhile, as the regulation for exhaust gases has become stricter, it is strongly desired to develop a heater or
the like which can reduce emissions during the cold start of engine.As an example of the honeycomb structures, there is known, for example, a technique disclosed in Japanese Utility
Model Application Publication (Laid-Open) No. 67609/1988. This document discloses a catalytic converter comprising
(1) a main ceramic monolithic catalyst and (2) a metallic monolithic catalyst capable of generating heat when electrified,
which comprises a metallic carrier and alumina coated thereon and which is provided upstream of the main monolithic
catalyst but closely thereto.In the catalytic converter disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Publication (Laid-Open) No. 67609/1988,
the metallic monolithic catalyst (2) is simply a preheater capable of generating heat when an electric current is passed
from the center of the foil type metallic honeycomb structure to the outer periphery, and has no resistance adjusting
means (that is, only the material, dimension and rib thickness of the honeycomb structure are specified and no resistance
adjustment means is provided) and accordingly has no appropriate temperature elevation property.Hence, the present applicant previously proposed, in Japanese Patent Application Publication (Laid-Open) No.
295184/1991 (3-295184), a heater comprising a honeycomb structure and at least two electrodes for electrification of
the honeycomb structure, attached to the honeycomb structure, wherein the honeycomb structure has a resistance
adjusting means (e.g. slits) between the electrodes and the open ends of the slits (the portions of the slits at the
periphery of the honeycomb structure) are filled with a zirconia type heat-resistant inorganic adhesive. The present
applicant also proposed, in Japanese Patent Application Publication (Laid-Open) No. 241715/ 1992 (4-241715) corresponding
to US-A- 5 202 548, a method for holding a honeycomb heater in a casing by covering the periphery of the
honeycomb
