<ABSTRACT>
A paper container according to the present invention 
includes a tab region (11) half cut for defining a tab region 

of a shape whose lower part is closed and whose upper part 
is opened in the substantially central part of one of top 

folded-in side panels (3,4). A stopper (14) is applied to an upper 
end of the tab region or near the upper end. The tab 

region is pulled from below after a pair of top folded-in 
side panels are separated apart, whereby a tab is formed, 

and the tab is pulled to split the seal between the top 

ribs and then the top folded-in ribs, and then the seal is 
opened. The tab region half cut is simply provided, and 

a stopper is simply provided for prohibiting breakage of 
the tab. The tab is not raised until the seal is opened, 

so that the tab does not get in the way of manufacturing 
the container without troubles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper container for
holding liquid, particulate matters etc.Conventionally gable-top paper containers are widely
used as containers for milk, juice, etc. The gable-top
container is set up by closing the bottom of the prismatic
barrel flat, and sealing the top into a gable after filled
with contents, a liquid. To open this paper container, an
operation of first splitting one sealed part of the top
seal therefrom, horizontally pulling said one sealed part
and the other sealed part of the top seal, causing the
inner seal to split open, and pulling up the folded-in
sealed parts of the inner seal is needed. But seal
strength of the top seal is so high that such opening
operation is difficult. To facilitate the opening operation,
paper containers with various extra tab members
provided on one of the folded-in top panels participating
in forming the opening have been proposed (e.g., Japanese
Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. 128931/1988,
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No.
66423/1990, etc.).In the paper container of the type described in
Japanese Utility Model Laid Open Publication No.
128931/1988, a tab member is partially secured to one
folded-in top panel, and attachment of the tab is not easy.
This is a problem. In the paper container of the type
described in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication
No. 66423/1990, the tab member is an obstacle to forming
the container, causing troubles. This is a problem. The US-A-3 520 464 discloses a paper container of gable type having a pouring
spout formed by unfolding one folded-in top panel of the gable. A pull ring is
associated with the pouring spout so that it may be moved to the pouring
position without the necessity of engaging the edges of the pouring spout by
grasping with the fingers. The pull ring is integral with a triangular folded-in top panel and
formed by a cut out. A triangular panel has to be secured inside to
the folded-in top panel. This is a problem as the pull ring has not to be secured
to the inside panel, so that it is free movable and may be easily gripped to open the
container. Therefore the manufacturing of a container having such a pull ring is
difficult and expensive.It is an object of the present invention to provide a paper container with a gable
top which may easily be manufactured and causes no trouble in being formed
and in addition can simply be opened.This object is achieved by a paper container having the features disclosed in
claim 1. Preferred embodiments are defined in

<CLAIMS>
A paper container made of a blank (2) comprising:

a top closed portion including a pair of top folded-in side panels (3, 4)
opposed to each other, each top folded-in side panel (3, 4) having a top

folded-in rib (9, 10) and slant fold lines (c) along which the top folded-in
side panel (3, 4) is folded in, and a pair of top side panels (5, 6) opposed

to each other, each having a top rib (7, 8), and, bent inward and holding the
top folded-in ribs (9, 10) of the top folded-in side panels (3, 4) between the

top ribs (7, 8); four side panels below the top closed portion; a bottom
below the four side panels; a tab region (11) formed in a substantially

central part of one of the top folded-in side panels (3),
