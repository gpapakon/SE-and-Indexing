<ABSTRACT>
Particulate adsorbents are described, based on inorganic oxides which are impregnated with an indicator dye selected from the group consisting of phenolphthalein, cresol red and thymol blue. Also described are a process for the production thereof and a process for the adsorptive drying of neutral gases using the said particulate adsorbents, their degree of water uptake being indicated by a reversible colour change.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the adsorptive drying of neutral gases,
characterised in that the neutral gases are brought into

contact with particulate adsorbents, wherein the particulate
adsorbents are moulded bodies based on inorganic oxides

impregnated with an indicator dye from the group comprising
phenolphthalein, cresol red and thymol blue.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the adsorbents are impregnated moulded bodies based on

inorganic oxides from the group comprising silicon dioxide,
aluminium oxide, alumino-silicate, magnesium oxide, titanium

dioxide, zirconium oxide or hafnium oxide or mixtures
thereof.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that,
on contact with water or steam, the impregnated adsorbents

exhibit a reversible change in colour.
Use of particulate adsorbents comprising impregnated
moulded bodies based on inorganic oxides impregnated with an

indicator dye from the group comprising phenolphthalein,
cresol red and thymol blue, for the adsorptive drying of

neutral gases.
