<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for supporting flexible screens, in particular background screens for photographic or electronic images, in the case of which device the screens are retained at one end by a supporting bar. For simple and reliable transportation and handling of the screens, the invention provides the arrangement of a mobile erectable box-like housing (1) which receives a number of screen reels (6) one beside the other and/or one above the other together with a supporting bar (11) and makes it possible to draw off the screens (6') individually and independently from the screen reels (6), counter to the action of the restoring force, and to secure the screens (6') by the free ends directly or indirectly on the supporting bar (11) which is fixed in the upright position on the receiving housing (1).
