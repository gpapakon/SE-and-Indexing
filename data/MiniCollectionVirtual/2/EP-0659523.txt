<ABSTRACT>
The device allows the shot-peening (sandblasting) of internal cavities which cannot be accessed by a direct pipe. It mainly comprises a shot-peening pipe (9) pointing in the direct shot-peening direction inside the cavities (11) to be shot-peened. This pipe (9) receives directly the shot and the highly compressed air (8) inside the rotor (10). The whole is introduced by means of a column (pillar) (6) mounted on a shot-peening machine (1) on the horizontal turntable (2) of which the component (10) is fastened. Application to the shot-peening of the internal surfaces of a turbojet engine rotor.

An apparatus for pressure shotblasting surfaces which are
not directly accessible and require the shot flow to undergo

an abrupt change of direction, comprising:

a shot feed duct (7);
high pressure compressed air propulsion means (8) secured
to the exit of the shot feed duct (7);
a shotblasting duct (9) to carry pressurised shot to
surfaces (13, 14, 15, 16) to be shotblasted, said duct being

secured to the propulsion means, and
a blasting nozzle (20 ,21, 22) disposed at the end of the
blasting duct (9);

characterised in that
the blasting duct (9) is straight;
the propulsion means comprise first and second high
pressure compressed air lines (8) opening into either side of

a bend (24) at the exit thereof, the bend receiving at its
entry the shot feed duct (7), the abrupt change of shot flow

direction occurring in the bend (24) before the connection to
the high pressure air feed lines (8) so that the propulsive

energy is imparted to the shot only at the entry of the
straight blasting duct (9) which opens directly into the

blasting nozzle (20, 21, 22), and
the blasting duct (9) is secured to the exit of the
propulsion means by a sleeve (27) rotatably mounted in a

support (25) of the propulsion means, rotation-producing means 
31, 32) being used to rotate the sleeve (27) around a

rotational axis (33) coaxial to the rotational axis of the
blasting duct (9), the rotation-producing means comprising a

turbine which has blades (32), has the axis (33) as its axis
of rotation and is secured to the sleeve (27), and a third

high pressure compressed air line (31) opening tangentially to
the turbine rotational axis opposite the turbine blades (32)

to rotate the blasting duct (9) and the blasting nozzle (20,
21,22) in a direction opposite to the direction of securing of

the sleeve.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that
the blasting duct (9) is connected to the exit of the

propulsion means on the sleeve (27) by way of a bayonet
connection (28, 29) which can be locked and unlocked to

facilitate rapid release of the blasting duct (9).
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that
the blasting nozzle (20, 21, 22) is screwed to the blasting

duct (9) releasably to facilitate rapid as-required
changing.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that
a pressure screw (34) is used to slow down or stop the

turbine..
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that
the shot feed duct (7) and the first, second and third high

pressure compressed air lines (8, 31) are maintained
substantially parallel to one another as far as the propulsion

means by means of a rigid column (6).
An apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that
it comprises a foot (4) secured to a shaft (4A) for moving a

shotblasting device (1) having a horizontal rotating plate (2)
carrying a turbojet engine rotor (10) to be shotblasted to 

ensure that the blasting duct (9) is disposed horizontally and
can be introduced into an internal toroidal cavity (11) of the

rotor (10).
