<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to olefin polymerization
catalysts and a process for the polymerization of olefins
using said catalysts.It has heretofore been known that titanium based
catalysts composed of a titanium compound and an
organoaluminum compound are used as catalysts for the
preparation of α-olefin polymers, for example, ethylene
polymers or ethylene/α-olefin copolymers.Generally, olefin polymers obtained with titanium
based catalysts have a broad molecular weight distribution
and a broad composition distribution, but are poor in
surface non-tackiness and transparency.There have recently been proposed processes for the
preparation of ethylene/α-olefin copolymers using catalysts
composed of zirconium compounds and aluminoxanes as a new
type of Ziegler catalyst for olefin polymerization.WO 88/05793, JP-A-501950/1989 and JP-A-502036/1989
disclose processes for the preparation of transition metal
compound catalysts containing ligand having a
cycloalkdienyl skeleton and anions containing elementary
boron, and teach that the catalysts exhibit activities in
olefin polymerization.Olefin polymers obtained with the above-mentioned new 
type of Ziegler catalysts for olefin polymerization usually
have a narrow molecular weight distribution and a narrow
composition distribution. However, for certain purposes
olefin polymers which have a broad molecular weight
distribution and which are excellent in moldability have
ardently been desired.Further, it is difficult to obtain olefin polymers
having a high molecular weight by polymerization or
copolymerization of olefins in the presence of transition
metal compound catalysts containing ligands having a
cycloalkadienyl skeleton. Accordingly, it has been desired
that transition metal compound catalysts containing ligands
having a cycloalkadienyl skeleton which are capable of
giving olefin polymers having a high molecular weight be
developed.The present invention seeks to provide olefin
polymerization catalysts having excellent polymerization
activities and capable of giving olefin (co)polymers which
have well balanced physical properties such as a broad
molecular weight distribution, excellent moldability and a
narrow composition distribution. The invention also seeks
to provide a process for polymerization of olefins using
said catalysts. The first olefin polymerization catalyst of the
invention comprises
[A] a titanium catalyst component containing
titanium, magnesium and halogen as its essential
ingredients,[B-2] a transition metal compound containing a ligand
having
