<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a processing composition for a 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material, and 
particularly to a solid processing composition for a silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive material having high 
strength and excellent lubricity and having no adverse affect 
on the light-sensitive materials, wherein no scrathes occur on 
the surface of the light-sensitive materials and no stains 
occur on the rollers of the automatic developing machine 
during processing. A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is 
photographically processed through a development step, a 
bleaching step, a fixing step, a washing step and/or a 
stabilization step after being exposed; a color paper light-sensitive 
material is photographically processed through a  
 
development step, a bleach-fixing step (bleaching, fixing), a 
fixing step, a washing step and/or a stabilization step after 
being exposed; and a black-and-white light-sensitive material 
is photographically processed through a development step, a 
fixing step and a washing step after being exposed. A 
reversal light-sensitive material is subjected to a reversal 
process in addition to the above steps. Recently, photographic processing is ordinarily conducted 
using an automatic developing machine (hereinafter also 
referred to an automatic processor) equipped with tanks 
containing the processing solution through which the light-sensitive 
material is transported. On such occasions, a replenisher replenishing system is 
commonly used wherein the processing solution in a processing 
tank is controlled so that the activity thereof is kept 
constant. Because of solution replenishing, much overflow-solution 
is ordinarily discharged. The replenisher solution is composed of various elements 
(hereinafter referred to part agent or parts agents) to give 
excellent photographic properties during the photographic 
processing. These parts agents, if in contact with each 
other, react or deteriorate over a long time and the 
photographic processing capability is reduced. There are many 
compounds in photographic processing agents which readily 
react by an oxidation reduction reaction. Therefore, the 
processing agents are composed of elements separated in one or  
 
two or more parts agents as kits and these agents are 
dissolved in a fixed amount of water when employed. The kits of the above parts agents are placed in vessels 
such as bottles and packages and these are placed in cases 
such as cardboard boxes and these boxes are
