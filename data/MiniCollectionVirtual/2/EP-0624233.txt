<ABSTRACT>
A control lever which is both mechanically connected to a mechanism which is to be manoeuvred in at least two directions and electrically connected via switches (15) to electrical positioning means. The control lever comprises a knob (10) supported at its one end, which knob is movable in different directions radially with respect to the lever's longitudinal axis (22) and is provided with a cavity into which the lever (11a) projects and with a peripheral surface (12) with a space to the outer surface of the lever. The space on the one hand presents at least one movable, ring-shaped electrical contact element as part of the switch, said element being connected with the knob and arranged to accompany this in its radial movements, and on the other hand also presenting an elastic, ring-shaped centring element (14) which lies with its one periphery against said peripheral surface of the cavity and with its other periphery against the lever. The centring element (14) strives to centre the contact element relative to the lever, whereby a manual sideways movement of the knob relative to the lever in any of said different directions displaces the ring-shaped contact element radially into one of several different contact positions in contact with the second contact element which is formed by the outside of the lever. The ring-shaped contact element (15) comprises at least one elastic distance piece (21) which is supported against the cavity's peripheral surface (12). The lever's movement inside the cavity is limited by abutment surfaces (13, 18) in such a way that the ring-shaped contact element (15) presents a residual mobility when the lever has reached the abutment surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control lever which is 
both mechanically connected to a mechanism which is to be 
manoeuvred in at least two directions and electrically 
connected via switches to electrical positioning means, 
comprising a knob supported at its one end, which knob is 
movable in different directions radially with respect to 
the lever's longitudinal axis and is provided with a cavity 
into which the lever projects, the cavity having a peripheral surface, 
the peripheral surface and the outer surface of the lever defining a space, 
said space on the one hand presenting at least one movable, 
ring-shaped electrical contact element as part of the 
switch, said element being connected with the knob and 
arranged to accompany this in its radial movements, and on 
the other hand also presenting an elastic, ring-shaped 
centring element which lies with its outer periphery against 
said peripheral surface of the cavity and with its inner 
periphery against the lever, whereby the centring element 
strives to centre the contact element relative to the 
lever, and whereby a manual sideways movement of the knob 
relative to the lever in any of said different directions 
displaces the ring-shaped contact element radially into one 
of several different contact positions in contact with the 
second contact element which is formed by the outside of 
the lever. A control lever of the above mentioned type (according to the features of the preamble of claim 1) is known from 
WO-A-91/02912, which lever has been used as a gear change 
lever in combination with an electrically operated clutch.  
 The arrangement has adequately fulfilled the requirements 
for sensitivity and precision which have to be met in order 
to achieve good operation. The arrangement makes it 
noticeably simpler to drive a car with a manual gearbox 
since the clutch does not have to be operated by foot, but 
instead is directly integrated with the gear change lever. However, it proved to be difficult to produce a 
control lever which fulfils the demands for feel and 
precision with normal gearchanging forces of 20-30N and at 
the same time meet the durability requirements for a 
maximum load of 1000N without deformation damage to the 
electrical contacts. A designer for this type of control 
must additionally take account of the ergonomic requirement 
and demand for good design. An object of the invention is therefore to achieve a 
control lever according to the preamble of claim 1 which can endure 
high stresses in all directions

<CLAIMS>
Control lever which is both mechanically connected to 
a mechanism which is to be manoeuvred in at least two 

directions and electrically connected via switches (15) to 
electrical positioning means, comprising a knob (10) 

supported at its one end, which knob (10) is movable in 
different directions radially with respect to the lever's 

longitudinal axis (22) and is provided with a cavity into 
which the lever (11, 11a) projects, the cavity having a peripheral 

surface (12), the peripheral surface and the outer surface of 
the lever defining a space, said space on the one hand presenting at least 

one movable, ring-shaped electrical contact element (19, 20) as part 
of the switch (15), said element (19, 20) being connected with the knob (10) 

and arranged to accompany this in its radial movements, and 
on the other hand also presenting an elastic, ring-shaped 

centring element (14) which lies with its outer periphery 
against said peripheral surface of the cavity and with its 

inner periphery against the lever (11, 11a), whereby the centring 
element (14) strives to centre the contact element (19, 20) relative to 

the lever (11, 11a), and whereby a manual sideways movement of the 
knob (10) relative to the lever (11, 11a) in any of said different 

directions displaces the ring-shaped contact element (19, 20) 
radially into one of several different contact positions in 

contact with the second contact element which is formed by 
the outside of the lever (11, 11a), 
characterized
 in 
that the ring-shaped contact element (15, 19, 20) comprises at 

least one elastic distance piece (21) which is supported 
against the cavity's peripheral surface (12), and in that 

the lever's movement inside the cavity is limited by 
abutment surfaces (13, 18) in such a way that the ring-shaped 

contact element (15, 19, 20) presents a residual mobility 
when the lever (11, 11a) has reached the abutment surfaces (13, 18).  

 
Control lever according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the distance piece (21) 
is comparatively stiffer than the elastic element (14). 
Control lever according to any preceding claim, 

characterized
 in that the movable contact 
element (19, 20) is so divided that it consists of two or more 

closed ring elements (19, 20) extending around the fixed 
contact element (11), whereby the contact surface for each 

of the ring elements extends over one or more predetermined 
sectors around the control lever's longitudinal axis (22).
