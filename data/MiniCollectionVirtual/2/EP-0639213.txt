A coke feeding device with housing for a coke dry cooling installation, which coke 
feeding device is associated with a cooling shaft and is composed of a fixed 

hopper with a suction line, of a conveyable hopper, a conveyable cooling shaft 
closure which can be raised and lowered, is provided with a sealing ring and is 

integrated into a raising and lowering device, as well as of the housing in which 
there are housed the conveyable hopper and the cooling shaft closure which are 

arranged on a common carriage conveyable on rails, characterised in that the 
conveyable hopper (2, 200, 201) is provided with a distributing bell (3, 4) and with 

a raisable and lowerable sealing ring (11), and in addition the housing (6, 600, 
601) is in the form of a hood with ground clearance or with openings in the walls 

(45, 450, 451, 46, 460, 461) for limited supplying of secondary air. 
A coke feeding device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the 
distributing bell (3) ofthe conveyable hopper (2, 201) is secured to a pipe length 

(40) borne by a crosspiece (39) anchored in the conveyable hopper (2, 201). 
A coke feeding device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the 
distributing bell (4) of the conveyable hopper (200) is secured to a supporting 

cross (58) anchored in the conveyable hopper (200). 
A coke feeding device in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the raisable and lowerable sealing ring (11) is displaced in guiding devices 

(23) and has a link mechanism consisting of lever arms (24) which are secured to 
shafts (29) and are loaded with counterweights (25), guide rollers (27) arranged on 

the shafts (29) being constructed to cooperate with cam plates (28) and the shafts 
(29) being secured via bearing blocks (60) to a carriage (22), stops (30) being 

associated with the counterweights (25) and the lever arms (24) being connected to 
the sealing ring (11) via chains (26). 
A coke feeding device in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 

characterised in that the housing (601) is two-part and one part is the hood top 
(431) which is securely attached to the fixed hopper (101) and the other part is 

composed of the longitudinal sides (451) and the transverse sides (461), and the 
sides (451, 461) are arranged so as to be displaceable and sealing relative to the  

 
hood top (431), and the longitudinal sides (451) are equipped with wheels or 

rollers (561), and the drive (14) is made fast on one transverse side (461) via the 
telescopic linkage (50), and the conveyable hopper (201) and the cooling shaft 

closure (8) with the raising and lowering device (15) are securely integrated into 
the conveyable part composed of the sides (451, 461). 
A coke feeding device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the fixed 
hopper (1) is equipped with a hopper closure (20). 
A coke feeding device in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that the 
hopper closure (20) is composed of two closing plates (64, 65) each of which has 

a drive (21) and a lever linkage (66) associated therewith.
