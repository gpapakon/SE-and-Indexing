<ABSTRACT>
Provision is made of a device for slowing down signatures transported in a folding machine. The device comprises a multiplicity of rotating grippers for the secure gripping of signatures (20), which come from a conveyor belt system (22) which is located in the folding machine which is running at high speed. Provision is also made of a deceleration drum (10) for slowing down the signatures by means of a gentle velocity profile. The deceleration drum has a multiplicity of pivoting arms (12), which are mounted rotatably on a rotary disc (14) which is rotating about a first axis and are connected, by means of a control lever (16), to a control disc (18), the control disc (18) rotating about a second axis which lies parallel and offset with respect to the first axis. The rotating grippers (26) are fastened to the outer ends of the pivoting arms (12). The rotating grippers grip the leading edge of the signatures coming from the conveyor belt system (22), while their trailing edges are still being controlled by the conveyor belt system. The deceleration drum can alternatively be equipped with a control cam (34) and a sliding connecting system (36) instead of the pivoting arm (12)/rotary disc (14) and control lever (16)/control disc (18) mechanism.

in that the gripper means is a gripper head (24). 
Slowing device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the gripper means is a rotating gripper (26) 

which is designed as a set of upper and lower 
rollers (28, 30) rotating in opposition, and in that the 

leading edge of a signature (20) coming from a transport 
means (22, 22A) is received in the nip (32) formed 

between the said rollers (28, 30). 
Slowing device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the transport means is a cutting cylinder. 
Slowing device according to Claim 1,  
 

characterized in that the transport means is a folding 
cylinder.
