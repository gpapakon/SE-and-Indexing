<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation and 
separation of individual stereoisomers of certain 1,3-dioxolane derivatives 
useful in treating mammals having disease-states characterized by 
hypercholesterolemia. Processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I): 
 
wherein 
n is 0, 1 or 2; 
each R1 is independently halo or lower alkyl; 
R2 is nitro or -N(R3)R4 where 
R3is hydrogen or lower alkyl; R4is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkylsulfonyl or 
-C(Y)R5 where Y is oxygen or sulfur and R5 is hydrogen, lower 
alkyl, lower alkoxy or -N(R6)R7 where R6 is hydrogen or lower 
alkyl and R7 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl; 
or R3 and R4together with N is pyrrolidino, piperidino, 
morpholino, thiomorpholino or piperazino, wherein the 
piperazino is optionally substituted at the 4-position by 
-C(O)R8 where R8 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or 
amino;  
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; are described, inter alia, 
in U.S. Patent No. 5,158,949, filed December 20, 1990, issued 
October 27, 1992, the disclosure of which is incorporated in full herein by 
reference. The compounds of formula (I), including their pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts, and the compositions containing them, inhibit cholesterol 
synthesis and are therefore useful in treating disease-states characterized 
by hypercholesterolemia. In particular, compounds of formula (I) inhibit 
cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting lanosterol 14α-demethylase, a  
 
cytochrome P-450 enzyme. Compounds of formula (I) are also more effective 
in inhibiting lanosterol 14α-demethylase than they are in inhibiting other 
cytochrome P-450 enzymes, for example, the cytochrome P-450 enzymes which 
contribute to gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis and cholesterol 
degradation. Thus, the compounds of formula (I) are useful in treating 
disease-states characterized by hypercholesterolemia with minimum effect on 
the physiological functions of key cytochrome P-450 enzymes. In general, the present invention is directed to an improved and 
efficient process for the preparation of single stereoisomers of compounds 
of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In the 
previously disclosed preparation of the compounds of formula (I) the 
individual stereoisomers were separated by the conventional method of flash 
chromatography, e.g., elution with 0.1% NH4OH and 5% methanol, which was 
gradually changed to a solution of 0.2% NH4OH and 10% methanol, in a 3:3:2 
mixture of ethyl acetate, methylene
