<ABSTRACT>
Silver-containing conductive coatings are provided. The 
coatings are prepared from compositions comprising silver 

particulate material, a low firing lead-free glass frit and a 
liquid organic vehicle. The composition is coated on a 

substrate and fired to fuse the silver-containing conductive 
coating to the substrate. The coatings find particular use in 

the field of automotive backlights. The coatings are of 
special value in eliminating solder wet through migration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides novel silver-containing
conductive coatings and a method for applying such coatings to
a glass substrate.Silver-containing conductive coatings are generally known in
the art. Attention in this respect is directed to U.S. Patent
No. 4,369,063 to McGowan, Jr.; U. S. Patent No. 4,029,605 to
Kosiorek; and U. S. Patent No. 4 975 301 to Andrews et al.Such coatings are useful for various purposes such as heating
elements, printed circuits and the like. They can be used as
defrost elements for automobile rear windows, as heating
elements for warming trays, as conductive elements for touch
panels, in printed circuits for electronic applications, and
for the manufacture of electronic components such as resistors
and capacitors.One of the principal uses for these coatings is as defrost
circuits for automobile backlights (rear windows).
Conventional silver-containing conductive coatings for such
use generally consist of a particulate silver in a glass frit
system. This conventional silver and glass system may contain
various elements as modifiers to enhance properties such as
bond strength, solderability and abrasion resistance. Sulfur-containing
compounds, such as silver sulfate, copper sulfate,
silver sulfide, etc., are frequently added in order to "stain"
the glass substrate when the compositions are applied. Thus,
they create a dark appearance when viewing the applied coating 
through the glass. These compositions are also dispersed in
a vehicle suitable for the intended area of application. For
example, pine oil-based vehicles are frequently utilized for
screen printing applications.The method of application of the compositions to the glass
substrate is conventional and typically includes well-known
techniques such as spraying, brushing, dipping, bonding or
screen or stencil printing.Following application of the composition to the substrate in
the desired pattern or design, the coating is optionally dried
and fired. The firing fuses the frit and effects a firm bond
between the coating and the substrate.When using such coatings in automotive backlights, after the
conductive coating has been sufficiently fused to the glass
substrate by means of the high temperature firing, electrical
connectors, either tabs or wire mesh braids, are soldered to
the surface of the conductive coating to complete the
electrical connection to the power source. A problem is
encountered in conventional conductive coatings in that solder
wet through migration occurs. This causes an undesirable
appearance
