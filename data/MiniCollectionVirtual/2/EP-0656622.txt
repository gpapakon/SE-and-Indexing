<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head suspension assembly is fabricated with a 
flexure (12) that is formed with a U-shaped finger (40) 

surrounded by a cutout (42) at the front end of the flexure 
12). A load dimple (50) is provided on the flexure (12). 

The flexure supports an air bearing slider (16) that pitches 
and rolls relative to a disk surface and is subject to 

lateral displacement during operation in a disk drive. The 
flexure (12) is formed with primary stabilizer sections (48) 

and secondary stabilizer arms (52) which reduce pitch and 
roll stiffnesses while increasing lateral stiffness, thereby 

maintaining a substantially constant slider flying height.

<DESCRIPTION>
Copending U.S. patent application Serial Number 07/926,033 filed
August 5, 1993 in behalf of M.R. Hatch et al., and assigned to
the same assignee, discloses a magnetic head suspension assembly
which incorporates, inter alia, a load beam and a flexure that
supports a slider. The present
invention is directed to a modification of the head suspension
assembly for reducing flying height variations by reducing pitch
and roll stiffnesses and increasing lateral stiffness.This invention relates to an improved magnetic head suspension
assembly and in particular to a modified flexure design for
reducing flying height variations and for providing better static
attitude control (flatness).Presently known disk drives, such as used in laptop or notebook
computers, include at least one rotatable magnetic disk, at least
one magnetic head assembly for transducing data recorded on the
disk, and a rotary head actuator for transporting the magnetic
head to selected data tracks on the rotating disk. The magnetic
head assembly comprises a head suspension fabricated with a rigid
load beam element and a spring-loaded flexure. An air bearing
slider is mounted at the end of the flexure and supports a thin
film magnetic transducer which coacts with the magnetic disk for
recording or reading data. When assembling the flexure to the
slider, it is necessary to position a load dimple formed on the
flexure at a predetermined point relative to the top surface of
the slider in order to achieve proper gimballing action of the
suspension. During operation of the disk drive, the rotating magnetic disk
provides an aerodynamic lift force through forming a boundary
layer to the slider, while an opposing gram load force is applied
to the slider through the flexure and load beam. The resultant
of the two opposing forces determines the flying height of the
slider and its transducer relative to the disk surface. In its
operating flying mode, the slider gimbals about a load dimple
formed in the flexure. The motion of the slider is subject to
pitch and roll, while the flexure encounters oscillations in a
vertical direction perpendicular to the plane of an associated
rotating disk, and also experiences bending forces as well as
swing and sway in a lateral direction. These movements of the
flexure and slider adversely affect the desired constancy of the
flying height unless controlled and minimized. By controlling
these motion characteristics of the flexure, the slider can be
made to follow closely the variations in topography of the
associated

A magnetic head suspension assembly for transducing data
that is recorded and read out from a surface of a rotating

magnetic disk drive comprising:

a load beam (10) formed with a central major section (20);
a flexure (12) joined to said load beam (10) said flexure
(12) having a front end and a rear end and a finger (40)

projecting within a cutout (42) close to said front end,
said flexure (12) having outrigger sections (44) disposed between the cutout (42) and the perimeter or sides of the flexure (12);
an air bearing slider (16), having leading and trailing
ends, joined to said flexure (12) for free gimbaling motion

while flying above an associated disk during operation in
a disk drive;

characterised in that

elongated slots (46) are formed in the outrigger sections (44) between the cutout (42) and the perimeter of the flexure (12) to create inner primary stabilizer sections (48) and outer secondary stabilizer arms (52),
whereby said slider (16) is maintained at a substantially
constant flying height during operation in a disk drive.

horseshoe shaped cutout (42) delineating said finger (40).
A head suspension assembly as in claim 1 or 2, wherein
said slot (46) is substantially triangular in shape and

has one side defining a shape substantially similar to the
shape of an adjacent portion of the perimeter of said

flexure (12) and said other side of said slot (46)
defining a path substantially parallel to a side of said

cutout (42)
A head suspension assembly as in claim 2 or 3, including
apertured ears (38) at the front end of said cutout (42) for

facilitating the formation of a bend of the front end of
said flexure (12). 
A head suspension assembly as in one of claims 1 to 4,
including a tooling hole (54) having a reference center

point for positioning said slot (46) within said
flexure (12).
A head suspension assembly as in claim 5, wherein the
front end of said slot (46) is located about 2/3 of the

distance from said reference center point (54) to said
front end of said flexure (12) and the rear end of said

slot (46) is located about 1/3 of the distance from said
reference center point (54) to said front end of said

flexure (12).
A head suspension assembly as in one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein said finger (40) is formed with a load dimple (50)

for providing gimbaling of said slider (16).
