<ABSTRACT>
A process of de-inking waste paper can be operated under conditions using a simple combination of chemicals to result in a waste liquor that is substantially environmentally friendly. The process comprises forming a pulp from the waste paper in an aqueous medium that has a pH of between 6 and 9 and that is substantially free of dissolved phosphate and that includes an ink-dispersing amount of dispersing agent, and separating the ink from the pulp.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the de-inking of waste
paper. In this specification we use the term "paper" to
be generic to cellulosic sheet materials including filled
and unfilled papers and paper board.It is standard practice to reclaim waste paper to
allow the reclaimed paper fibres to be used as part or all
of the stock of subsequent paper production. The waste
paper needs to be de-inked and it is standard practice to
achieve this by forming a pulp from the waste paper in an
aqueous medium that includes de-inking chemicals, and
separating the ink from the pulp. This separation may be
by, for instance, washing and/or flotation.Typical chemical processes for de-inking are described
in US-A-1,925,372, 2,525,594, 4,347,099 and 4,780,179,
WO-A-90/10749 and FR-A-2,281,456. As is apparent from these
publications, typical de-inking chemicals have comprised a
complex mixture of chemicals. Generally they include a
significant amount of alkaline material, with sodium
silicate, hydroxide and carbonate frequently being
proposed.The literature shows that the pH of the resultant pulp
during the de-inking process is usually high, for instance
above 9 and most usually above 10. Exposing the
cellulosic fibres to this degree of alkalinity tends to
cause yellowing of the fibres and so it is generally
necessary to add a peroxide as a bleaching agent.It is also known to include various other additives.
For instance in US-A-4,347,099 it is proposed to use a
mixture of sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, a
carboxylic polymer (usually polyacrylic acid or,
preferably, poly hydroxy acrylic acid), dispersants such as
anionic, cationic or non-ionic surface active agents, and
other additives such as collectors, foaming agents, alkali
silicates and pH regulators. The use of this complex and 
highly alkaline mixture is undesirable since the liquor
that results from the de-inking process results in
environmental disposal problems.US-A-4,162,186 describes a deinking process which
requires a combination of a water-soluble non-ionic
surfactant and an oil-soluble non-ionic surfactant as the
main deinking agent. The process may be carried out at a
pH of 8.0 or below.GB-A-2,178,079 describes the use of polymers of
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomers, for instance
(meth) acrylic acid salt in a process of deinking wood free
pulps formed from paper coated with colour pigments. The
polymeric material is used to accelerate disintegration of
the coating pigment.A simpler composition is described in WO-A-90/10749 and
