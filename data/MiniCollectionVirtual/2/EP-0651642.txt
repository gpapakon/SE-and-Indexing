<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF 1 -3-DICYCL0PR0PYMETHYL-8-AMIN0-XANTHINE FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS AND OBESITYThe present invention relates to a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity or for the treatment of Type II diabetes and a compound for use in such method.European patent application, Publication No. 0389282 describes compounds of formula (A):or if appropriate a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R* and R^ each independendy represent alkyl or a moiety of formula (a):-(CH2)m-A (a)wherein m represents zero or an integer 1, 2 or 3, A represents a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic hydrocarbon radical, providing that when R- represents methyl then R is not methyl; andR3a represents a halogen atom, a nitro group, or a group -NR4R5 wherein R4 and R^ each independently represent hydrogen, alkyl or alkylcarbonyl or R^ and R5 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form an optionally substituted heterocyclic group.Example 9 of EP 903030930.0 is 1,3-di-cyclopropymethyl- 8-amino xanthine (hereinafter preferred to as Compound 1). The compounds in European application No. 90303093.0 are described inter alia as having activity in the treatment of cerebral vascular and neuronal degenerative disease and to act as phosphodiesterase inhibitors elevating cyclic AMP levels.It has now surprisingly been discovered that Compound 1 increases energy expenditure and also decreases food intake and is therefore of potential use in the treatment of obesity in mammals, including humans.Compound I is also indicated to be effective in improving insulin sensitivity and hence to be effective in the treatment of Type II diabetes.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity or for the treatment of Type II diabetes in mammals, such as humans, which comprises administering to the mammal in need of such 

treatment and/or prophylaxis an effective and/or prophylactic, non-toxic amount of Compound 1.The present invention also provides Compound 1 for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity or for the treatment of Type II diabetes. In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity or for the treatment of Type II diabetes which comprises Compound 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.In yet a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of Compound 1 for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment
