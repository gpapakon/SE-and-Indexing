<ABSTRACT>
A superplasticizing additive for concrete and other 
cementitious mixes with high retention of workability (low 

"slump loss") and low air-entraining effect, is made by 
terpolymers 
of a) (meth)acrylic acid and its salts, 
b)polyethyleneglycolmonomethylether-(meth)acrylate and c) 

polypropyleneglycol-di(meth)acrylate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new superplasticizing 
additive for concrete and other cementitious materials 
capable to considerably increase the initial workability of 
the mixes and to maintain this workability for longer 
periods than those corresponding to the traditional 
superplasticizers and to allow an easy placing of the 
concrete. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a superplasticizer with the above mentioned properties 
and further characterized by a low air-entraining effect and 
no adverse effect on the mechanical properties of the 
concrete, even at the early age of curing. Superplasticizers are extensively used in the 
construction industry because their addition considerably 
increases the fluidity of fresh concrete without adding more 
water to the mix. Furthermore, they allow a considerable 
reduction of the mixing water and an easy placing of high 
quality concretes which, once hardened, are characterized by 
high strength. Traditional superplasticizers based on the condensation 
between formaldehyde and naphthalene sulfonic acid salts  
 
(NSFC) or melamine sulphite modified resins (MSFC) cannot 
maintain the workability of fresh mixes for long periods. So, 
even after few minutes, a sharp decrease of the fluidity can 
occur, known as "slump-loss" effect of the fresh concrete. 
When "slump-loss" occurs, the initial workability is normally 
restored at the site of placing by adding more water to the 
mix, with a consequent adverse effect on the mechanical 
properties and the durability of the hardened concrete. Recently, "zero slump-loss" superplasticizers have been 
developed capable to maintain the same fluidity for longer 
periods and allow the transport of fresh concrete for long 
distances without further retempering the concrete at the 
placing-site. These new additives are based on crosslinked 
hydrophilic acrylic polymers which hydrolize in the strong 
alkaline medium of cementitious mixes to produce linear 
polymer chains which reduce the "slump loss" effect. Examples of such additives are described in Japanese 
Patent Application n. 281014, based on copolymers of 
(meth)acrylic acid, ethoxy esters of (meth)acrylic acid and a 
crosslinking monomer having the following general formula: 
 
where: 
X represents hydrogen or methyl radical;  
 
Y represents -O-(R1-)n-O- radical (R1 is an alkylene radical 
and n is integer from 2 to 30). In this case the crosslinking 
agents of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting 
(meth)acrylic acid and ethylene glycol
