<ABSTRACT>
In a CD type disk player, main data in a digital signal, 
which is read from a CD type disk (1) traced by a pickup (4), is 

decoded in a decoding means (13) in accordance with a bit clock 
regenerated in a clock (22) regenerator. The writing and reading 

of the data into and from a memory both can be synchronized 
with the bit clock. Also, a selector (25) can switch over the 

operation clock of the decoding means, thereby selecting the 
more important factor, of either time base precision or 

decoding ability, in correspondence with the kind of disk. 
While avoiding the enlargement in size and power consumption 

of the disk motor, the read out of the information from the 
disk can be conducted at a higher speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disk player which plays
back a CD type disk and in particular to a disk player which
can reproduce main data recorded on a CD-ROM disk at high
speed.In a CD type disk such as a CD-DA disk for exclusive
audio use, or a CD-ROM disk for exclusive use as a read-only
memory for digital information, as is well known, main data
such as audio data and computer data is recorded along with
error correcting codes. A CD type disk player for playing
the disk is provided with decoding means to decode the main
data for correcting the error of the main data, and a memory
to rearrange the data subjected to the decoding.The conventional decoding means operates in accordance
with a reference clock delivered from a reference oscillator
comprising a crystal resonator.From the digital signal read from the disk, a bit clock
is regenerated synchronously with each bit of the digital
signal. The write operation for the memory is synchronized
with the bit clock while the read operation for the memory is 
synchronized with the reference clock. Accordingly, the
jitter of the main data is absorbed in the memory. However,
the memory is also used for the encoding, so that the jitter
margin cannot be made sufficiently large enough within the
memory. As a result, a response of the rotation servo system
should be set at a level which enables the disk to revolve
within the rated velocity in order to hold the data within
the jitter margin.A CD-ROM disk player for playing a CD-ROM disk has
recently been developed to read data from the disk at a speed
higher than the rated velocity, for example at a speed twice
the rated velocity, so as to enhance the data transmission
rate. In such a CD-ROM disk player, it is necessary to
remarkably enhance the response of the rotation servo system
compared with the rated velocity. The enhancement of the
response leads to an enhancement of accelerating and
decelerating control of the disk in response to the
displacement of the trace of the pickup required for search,
thereby achieving a high speed search. This condition causes
a demand for a high torque motor as a disk motor in order to
improve the drive characteristic of the disk motor.However, the high torque disk motor results in not only
enlargement and higher cost but also a disadvantage with
respect to the electric power consumption.In addition, in a CD-ROM disk player with a high speed 
reproduction, as described above, the high speed search is
indispensable. Upon the high speed search, the encoding of
the data has to be
