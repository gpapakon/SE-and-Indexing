<ABSTRACT>
A device for indicating spinning-station faults and for qualifying them is proposed. Also proposed is a method for recording and evaluating faults which have occurred on a yarn-spinning station, according to which the abovementioned fault indicator can operate. In order to increase the operating effectiveness of the spinning machine and in order, when a fault occurs in the yarn or in another electrical or mechanical device of the spinning machine, to induce a reaction appropriate to the hierarchy or quality of the fault indication, the parameter signal of the yarn obtained from a measuring device (20) is fed to an evaluation stage (21, 22) which transmits the fault-indication signals. These are assigned to fault groups (A, B, C, D) predetermined in an assignment section (23) provided directly at the spinning station. The output signals from the assignment section in each case represent a group of faults which (automatically) induce graded fault-elimination reactions.

Spinning-station fault indicating and qualifying device

comprising a measuring apparatus (20, 25) for measuring at
least one parameter of a moving yarn in a spinning

station,

a) including an evaluation stage (21; 22; 22a, 22b, 22c
...), which is adapted for continuously evaluating at

least one measured parameter of the yarn taking into
account predetermined criteria;

characterized in that
b) the evaluation stage is adapted for generating fault
indicating signals (L/T, M
0
, C, N/S, CV) ;
c) an allocation section (23) is provided, which is
adapted for allocating the fault indicating signals to

different predetermined fault groups (A, B, C, D),
especially in a variable, qualifying manner.
Device according to claim 1, wherein the yarn (1) is
pulled off from a rotor (10; 10a, 10b; 11), adapted to be

operated at high speeds, and supplied to a take-up unit
(14), wherein the yarn-parameter measuring apparatus (20)

is arranged between the pull-off site at the rotor and the
take-up unit (14) within the course of the yarn,

preferably close to the pull-off site.
Device according to any one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the
fault groups (A, B, C, D) are formed directly (locally) at

the spinning station and have different indicating
hierarchies.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a
control means is provided, which, in case of multiple -

unsuccessful or only partially successful - attempts to
remedy the same fault condition (22f), is adapted to 

automatically up-grade the fault condition into a more
momentous fault group (B, C, D).
Device according to claim 3 or 4, wherein

an indicating hierarchy (C) blocks the spinning
station; and/or
a (different) indicating hierarchy (B) stops the
spinning station; and/or
a (further) indicating hierarchy (B) signals a fault
condition to a moving automat, which fault condition

can be remedied by it, especially by causing a
thread/yarn breakage; and/or
a (further) indicating hierarchy (D) completely
switches off the spinning station; and/or
a (further) indicating hierarchy (A) generates an
optical notice, in particular prints out a message,

displays a message on a monitor or activates one or
more signal lamps.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein a plurality of fault subgroups is defined within

one fault group (A, B, C, D).
Device according to claim 6, wherein the qualifying
allocation (23) of the fault subgroup is variable.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the measuring apparatus comprises


a capacitor (20), through which the yarn passes, in
order to continuously detect the instantaneous

thickness (d) of the thread on the basis of its mass;
or
an optical sensor for detecting the thread thickness
without delay.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein a further measuring apparatus (25, 26, 13) is

provided in order to supply the evaluation stage (21, 22) 
with further yarn parameters, such as thread length per

time unit (v) or thread length (Î”s).
Method
 for detecting and evaluating occurred fault
conditions at a yarn-spinning station employed by the

spinning-station fault indicating and qualifying device
according to any one to the preceding claims,

wherein two or more fault groups (A, B, C, D) are defined,
to which individual fault conditions occurring during

operation of the yarn-spinning station, in particular
groups of yarn faults, electronic component faults,

mechanical function element faults, are allocated in order
to automatically trigger off graded fault remedy

reactions, and wherein the allocation of fault conditions
to the at least two fault groups (A, B, C, D) is variable

with regard to the specific type of machine, user and/or
operation.
Method according to claim 10, wherein multiple -
unsuccessful or only partially successful - attempts to

remedy the same fault condition (22f) cause that the fault
condition is automatically up-graded into a fault group

(B, C, D) which is hierarchically more momentous.
Method according to claim 10 or 11, wherein

a fault group (B) signals to an automat to come here,
a fault group (A) induces manual fault remedy by a
spinner,
a fault group (B, C) informs a mechanic or an
electronics technologist of the service personnel,
a fault group (C) blocks the spinning station,
a fault group (D) switches off the spinning station
and/or
a fault group (D) informs the manufacturer of the
machine.
