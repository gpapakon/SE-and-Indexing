<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to a seam-folding system to 
compensate the bending of metallic containers (1) which can 

be applied during the manufacturing process applicable to 
all kind of metallic containers (1) of a shape that can be 

either trunco-pyramidal, prismatic, elliptical or similar 
to correct the bending (5) produced when the body of the 

container (1) is expanded and specifically during the seam-folding (4) 
operation to fix the bottom (2) to the sides of the 

container. The hook of the ends or corners of the 
container is housed in the bottom hook with a slight 

difference in length between them while the hook of the 
intermediate areas of the container is considerably 

narrower than the bottom hook. The compensation of this 
difference in length is performed during the seam-folding (4) 

operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a water-tight metallic container
according to the first part of claim 1 wherein
the bending of metallic containers
is to be compensated
aiming
to prevent the usual bending that normally appears in
the metallic containers during the expansion operations
carried out to obtaining or manufacturing such containers.The seam-folding system
of the inventive container which
compensates the bending can be
applied to all kind of metallic containers of a shape
that can be either trunco-pyramidal, parallelopipedic,
elliptical, etc.As everybody knows, when the body of a metallic container
is expanded, a deformation occurs due to stress of the
material. Such deformation is called "bending" and
happens in the bottom causing an uneven distribution of
material in the periphery of the body of the container.When the containers are manufactured it is necessary to
correct such bending since such anomaly may lead to
defective seam-folding when the joint between the bottom
and the side area of the container is made through seam-folding
which entails the subsequent risks of leakage due
to a lack of water-tightness in certain containers.The object of the invention is to absorb or compensate
the differences in the length between the hooks at the
corners and those intermediate ones produced during the
seam-folding of the container and its bottom.Currently the compensation can be achieved in accordance
with the following three stages: 
1. To cut the material with the periphery compensated
before welding the body and its subsequent expansion.2. To expand the body of the container with concave
expanding tools so that they can proportionately compensate
the subsequent deformation.3. To cut the excess of the body of the container after
its expansion.The object is solved with a water-tight metallic container
according to claim 1 and a process according to claim 4.The
water-tight container according to claim 1 has a
seam-folding system to compensate the
bending, which achieves that during the seam-folding operation
the defect mentioned-above is corrected which, in turn,
will save the operations 1 and 3 referred to above and
which are prior to the seam-folding operation.As far as operation 2 is concerned, enable
the container according to claim 1 and the process according to
claim 4
a more
uniform and straight configuration of the container wall
which, in turn, enables to better store such containers.To complement this description and in an effort to better
understand the main characteristics of the invention, a
set

<CLAIMS>
A water-tight metallic container comprising an expanded body
(1) having a peripheral side flange (3), a bottom (2),

and a seam-folded joint (4) between said bottom (2) and said
peripheral side flange (3), so that at said joint (4), a hooked

portion of said flange (3) is housed into and overlaps a
peripheral loop of said bottom (2), characterized in that

said peripheral side flange (3) has an uneven width so-called
bending (5) which comprises at corners wider

hooks (7') and at intermediate portions narrower
hooks (6'), in that said loop has a constant height (10)

which is substantially the same as
the height of

said wider hooks (7')
so that the latter completely overlap said loop, while

the narrower hooks (6') do not totally overlap said
loop, and in that said seam-folded joint (4) is

compressed in an area (8) corresponding to the height of
the narrower hooks (6').
A water-tight container according to claim 1,
characterized in that said seam-folded joint (4)

comprises a stepped and corrugated area (9) for reducing
the height of said
 hooks (6', 7').
A water-tight container according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the height of
said narrower hooks (6') is half of the

height of said loop.
Process for manufacturing a water-tight metallic container
according to any of the foregoing claims, comprising the

steps of :

expanding the body (1) of said container causing an
uneven width in the peripheral side flange (3) thereof, due to 

so-called bending (5) with wider areas at the corners (7)
and narrower areas (6) at the intermediate portions,
seam-folding the peripheral loop of the bottom (2) onto
said peripheral side flange (3) so that said loop has a

constant height (10) which is substantially the same as the
length of the hooks (7') resulting from said wider areas

(7), said loop housing said wider hooks and the narrower hooks (6')
resulting from said narrower areas (6) so that said wider

hooks (7') completely overlap said loop while said narrower
hooks (6') do not totally overlap same, and
compressing an area (8) of said seam-folded joint (4)
corresponding to the height of the shorter hooks (6').
Process according to claim 4, comprising the step of
corrugating an area (9) of said seam-folded joint (4) for

reducing the height of said hooks (6', 7').
