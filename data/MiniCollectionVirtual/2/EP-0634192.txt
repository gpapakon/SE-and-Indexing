<ABSTRACT>
A heart stimulator (2) is described which emits stimulation 
pulses to a heart, said heart stimulator (2) comprises a 

function unit (14, 16) for regulating a variable function in 
the heart stimulator (2), a measurement device (32) for 

measuring the return flow of blood to the heart and a control 
device (26, 28, 30) for controlling the function unit's 

regulation of the function on the basis of changes in the 
return flow of blood. A particularly advantageous version is 

achieved when the function unit (14, 16) comprises a pulse 
generator (14, 16) which generates and emits the stimulation 

pulses at a variable interval, the heart stimulator then 
becoming rate-adaptive and optimizing cardiac output. In 

this manner, heart rate is regulated on the basis of a variable 
directly related to the body's oxygenation needs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heart stimulator comprising
at least one function unit for regulating a variable
function in the heart stimulator, a measurement device for
measuring an activity-related physiological variable and a
control device for controlling the function unit's regulation
of the function on the basis of the physiological variable.The task of a heart stimulator is to stimulate a defective
or dysfunctional heart. In order to provide the patient with
an optimum quality of life, the heart stimulator should
supply the defective heart with therapy producing a cardiac
function resembling the function of a healthy heart to the
greatest possible extent. In order to achieve this, the
heart stimulator must perform a number of functions, such as
determining the amplitude and duration of stimulation
pulses, the interval at which stimulation pulses are to be
emitted, whether both the atrium and ventricle are to be
stimulated, the interval to elapse between an atrial and a
ventricular stimulation pulse etc.The stimulation interval is a particularly important parameter
for the heart stimulator. By changing the stimulation
interval, the heart rate can be varied and induced to simulate
the rate variations occurring in a healthy heart during
e.g. activity or stress. A plurality of known heart stimulators
have been devised which attempt to simulate the
response of a healthy heart to activity.One such prior art heart stimulator is described in US-A-4,535,774
in which the stroke volume of a heart is determined
either by measuring blood flow into the heart or by
measuring impedance in the heart. The stroke volume determined 
is then used for setting a heart rate. In order to
achieve the most optimum cardiac function possible, i.e.
when the amount of blood pumped out the heart each minute is
sufficient for the body's needs without the heart rate
becoming excessively fast, the relationship between stroke
volume and heart rate is utilized in which stroke volume is
assumed to increase with increasing heart rate.Thus, the known heart stimulator actually measures the
heart's stroke volume and then uses changes in this parameter
for determining an appropriate stimulation rate which is
then imposed on the heart.However, the utilization of stroke volume is not an especially
suitable way of controlling the heart rate because of
the heart's physiological operation and the normal course of
a cardiac cycle.Blood in Man is distributed in two circulations. The pulmonary
circulation carries blood low in oxygen from the
