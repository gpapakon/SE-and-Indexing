<ABSTRACT>
In order to recycle iron-containing steel work residues such as dust, sludge and mill scale (1 to 3), which may contain iron in both metallic and oxidic form, in an effective manner, while consuming as little energy as possible, the steel work residues (1 to 3) are transformed into agglomerates (8, 11), the agglomerates (8, 11) are loaded into an electric arc furnace (10) in which they are molten and reduced, and the resulting smelt is refined.

<CLAIMS>
Method for producing an iron melt, in particular a
crude steel melt (23), using iron-containing

residual smelting plant materials (1 to 3),

characterized by
 the combination of the following
features:


residual smelting plant materials (1 to 3) are
processed into agglomerates (8, 11),
the agglomerates (8, 11) are charged into an
electric arc furnace (10), the electric arc

furnace being operated in foamed slag,
melted,
reduced in a crude iron melt with a
sufficiently high carbon content therefor,
and the resultant melt is refined.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the electric arc furnace (10) is additionally
charged with liquid and/or solid pig iron (22),

which is likewise refined.
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the pig iron (22) is charged at least partially
before the residual smelting plant materials (1 to

3).
Method according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that

the pig iron (22) is substituted partially or
entirely by a carburized residual liquid pool. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 2 to 4,

characterized in that
 residual smelting plant
materials (1 to 3) are charged in an amount of at

least 5%, preferably in an amount of approximately
40 to 50%, of the total charge.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 crude steel, semisteel or
liquid pig iron is produced as the metal product.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 a crude steel with a carbon
content of at most 0.1% is produced.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 rolling scale slurry (1),
which is preferably treated with calcined lime, in

particular before agglomeration, is charged as the
residual smelting plant material.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 dusts and/or slurries (3)
from converter and/or electric arc-furnace

operation and/or the pig-iron production
installation and/or the direct reduction

installation (2) are used in particular for
charging as residual smelting plant material.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that
 the residual smelting plant
materials (1 to 3) are mixed before charging and

have calcined lime (CaO) (5) added as a binder,
whereupon the residual smelting plant materials (1

to 3) are agglomerated and the agglomerates (8)
thus formed are dried to a residual moisture

content of less than 5%.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10,

characterized in that
 first of all pig iron (22) 
is charged into the electric arc furnace (10),

whereupon the residual smelting plant materials (1
to 3) are continuously charged over a

predetermined time period and, during this time,
the refining process i
s carried out.
Method according to Claim 11, 
characterized in
that
 refining takes place for a predetermined
remaining time, without any charging of residual

smelting plant materials (1 to 3) being carried
out.
Installation for carrying out the method according
to one or more of Claims 1 to 12,


with a mixing reactor (4), into which there
opens at least one line feeding in residual

smelting plant materials (1 to 3), an H
2
O feed
line and a line feeding in binder (5),
with an agglomerating device (7),
with a drying device, from which the dried
agglomerates (11) can be passed to a screening

device,
with an electric arc furnace (10), into which
there leads at least one line feeding in the

agglomerates (11),
with a line passing the coarse fraction (11'')
from the screening device into the electric arc

furnace (10) through at least one cover opening
(12) and optionally a line passing the fine

fraction (11') to at least one lance (13)
protruding into the electric arc furnace (10),
with a feed for pig iron (22) leading into the
electric arc furnace, a tapping opening for the

slag (24) and a tapping opening for the iron
melt (23) produced.
Installation according to Claim 13, 
characterized
in that
 the electric arc furnace (10) is provided
with at least one carbon under-bath nozzle (17). 
Installation according to Claim 13 or 14,
characterized by
 a filter system (26), to which
there leads a waste-gas line (21), extending from

the arc furnace (10), and from which filter system
(26) a line for dusts (27) separated from the

waste gas leads to the mixing reactor (4).
Installation according to Claim 15, 
characterized
in that
 there extends from the drying device (9) a
line carrying away vapours (30), which leads to

the filter system (26).
