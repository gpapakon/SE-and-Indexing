<ABSTRACT>
In a tape drive machine, in order to allow the position of a tape head 80 to be moved 
laterally across the tape and to allow the azimuth angle of the tape head to be adjusted 

independently of the lateral position, but using a single motor 92, the motor 92 drives 
a pair of gears 86, 88, one of which is fixed to an indexing screw 84, but the other 

of which is connected to another indexing screw 82 
via
 a backlash device 94. 
The specification also describes a path for the tape, threading of the tape, the drive 
motor, construction of a motor stator, and detection of the beginning and end of tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tape drive machines for magnetic or optical tape, or other 
types of data storage tape. Various aspects of the invention are concerned with 
indexing of a tape drive head, an improved tape path through a tape drive machine, 
threading of the tape into the tape drive machine, a tape drive motor, a construction 
of motor stator and a dual performance motor. In this specification, the tape drive 
apparatus may be described in one particular orientation, but the claims should be 
interpreted to cover the apparatus whether in that orientation or bodily turned, for 
example, through a right angle.  It is common to record data on a magnetic tape in a 
plurality of tracks spaced apart across the width of 
the tape. In order to write to or read from the 
plurality of tracks, either a multi-track head may be 
used, or alternatively a single track head may indexed 
across the width of the tape to the appropriate 
position. The drive to move the head may be provided 
by a stepper motor, or a DC motor and encoder, and an 
appropriate gear mechanism. It is also common to 
provide for azimuth adjustment of the head. In a 
basic arrangement, a manual azimuth adjustment is 
provided, and the azimuth angle of the head is set 
when the machine is built, and can be adjusted when 
the machine is serviced. This aspect of the invention is concerned with 
enabling a more compact arrangement to be provided to 
serve the purpose of indexing the head across the tape 
and also adjusting the azimuth angle of the head. In 
accordance with this aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a data head indexing system comprising a 
reversible motor, and first and second mechanisms 
driven by the motor for indexing first and second 
portions, respectively, of the head in opposite 
directions across a recording medium, the first 
mechanism incorporating a backlash device so that, as 
the mechanisms drive the head in unison, the head is 
bodily moved across the recording medium, but so 
that, as the backlash of the backlash device is being 
taken up, the second mechanism alone moves the first 
portion of the head to adjust the azimuth angle of the 
head relative to the recording medium. Thus, the 
system provides for indexing and azimuth adjustment 
with the use of only a single motor.  The system preferably also includes means for 
controlling the motor, the control means being 
operable when moving the head in one direction to 
cause the motor to drive the second mechanism in one 
direction and take up the
