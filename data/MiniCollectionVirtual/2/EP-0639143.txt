<DESCRIPTION>
 LATCH FOR A CONTAINERField Of The InventionThis invention relates to containers, and more particularly, to an improved latch for securing the lid or cover of a container to the base of the container.Background Of The InventionThere is a demand in the marketplace for improved methods of sealing perishable consumer products to maintain thei freshness. Historically, perishable products such as baked good and vegetables had to be brought to market and sold quickly before exposure to the atmosphere caused the products to lose their freshness. The advent of plastics resulted in many products being wrapped or packaged in plastic, both in the form of flexible plastic bags and solid plastic containers. The use of plastics has greatly improved the "shelf life" of perishable products, allowing both merchants and their customers to store the products for longer periods of time, resulting in a substantial savings.A number of sealable containers are currently availabl and are typically formed from plastic or other lightweight material. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,753,351 to Guillin discloses a P.V.C. or polystyrene sealable container that includes a base tray and a hinged cover. The food is placed in the tray and the cover is brought into sealed engagement with t base tray to seal the food from the environment. Similarly, U.S Patent No. 4,976,370 to Cassel discloses a container and sealin lid formed of plastic such as polypropylene or polyethylene.While such containers have successfully increased the life of perishable products, the effectiveness of the container is limited by the ability of the latch between the base of the container and the lid to prevent air from entering the containeContainers are also used to store goods without isolating or sealing the goods from the environment. For 

exa ple, certain baked goods are placed in containers for transportation or sale before the goods have cooled. The containers that hold these hot goods are vented to allow air to escape from the container while the goods cool to room temperature to prevent moisture buildup in the container. Such containers, while not sealed from the environment, nevertheless require that a secure latch be used to prevent the lid from inadvertently opening and spilling the goods stored therein.Summary Of The InventionThe present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by providing an improved latch which securely attaches the cover of a container to the base of the container. The container of the invention generally comprises: a

CLAIMS 1. A container for storing foods or other goods comprising: a tray including a bottom and at least one side wall extending upwardly from said bottom, said side wall including a flange; a cover including a top and at least one side wall extending downwardly from said top, said side wall of said cover including a second flange; wherein each of said flanges of said cover and said tray comprise a curved surface, said curved surfaces interlockin over an arc of more than 180* to secure said tray and said cover.
2. The container of claim 1 further comprising a hinge connecting said cover to said base.
3. The container of claim 2 wherein said hinge is formed of an oriented polymeric material.
4. The container of claim 1 wherein said flanges extend around the entire perimeter of said tray and said cover.
5. The container of claim 1 wherein said container is formed of plastic.
6. The container of claim 1 wherein said tray and said cover each comprise a plurality of side walls.
7. The container of claim 1 wherein the curved surfaces o said flanges are circular.
8. The container of claim 7 wherein the radius of the outer surface of one of said curved surfaces is approximately equal to the radius of the inner surface of the other of said curved surfaces. 


 .9. The container of claim 1 wherein said flanges form a seal between said tray and said cover to prevent air from entering said container.
10. A container for storing foods or other goods comprising: a tray including a bottom and at least one side wall extending upwardly from said bottom, said side wall having a flange extending from an outer perimeter of said side wall; a cover including a top and at least one side wall extending downwardly from said top, said side wall of said cover having a second flange extending from an outer perimeter of said side wall; wherein each of said flanges comprises an annular engaging member, and wherein one of said annular engaging members is received within the other annular engaging member such that a surface of one said annular engaging member contacts a surface of the other said annular engaging member along an arc that is greater than 180*.
