<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
analyzing a gas sample and, more particularly, to mass 
spectrometers utilizing quadrupole mass filters, or the like. Much of pulmonary physiology is based on the analysis 
of respiratory gases and the mass spectrometer has shown its 
usefulness as a high speed accurate gas analyzer. The mass 
spectrometer is an apparatus that separates charged particles 
(ions) according to their mass-to-charge ratios and determines 
the relative abundance of each type of ion present. Mass spectrometers used in pulmonary applications 
generally include a sample-inlet assembly, an ionization chamber, 
a focusing lens, a mass filter in a filter chamber and a sensor, 
all housed in a low pressure vacuum envelope. Examples of such 
prior mass spectrometers are found in U.S. Patents Nos. 
4,008,388, issued to McLafferty et al., and 4,816,685, issued to 
Lange. The sample-inlet system captures the respiratory gas to 
be analyzed and directs it to the ionization chamber. A stream 
of electrons from a filament bombards the gas entering the 
ionization chamber and causes the gas molecules to lose electrons 
thereby producing positive ions. The ions alone are focused into 
a beam and accelerated into the filter chamber. The electrons  
 
are not allowed to pass into the filter chamber. In the filter 
chamber, the ion beam is sorted into its components on a mass-to-charge 
ratio by the mass filter. In the filter chamber, a mass filter, as for example a 
quadrupole mass filter, is utilized to separate ions by their 
mass-to-charge ratios. The filter does so by the application of 
an electric and/or magnetic field. The filter is designed such 
that the ions of the molecule to be measured, for example 
preselected oxygen (M/e 32) ions, continue through the filter 
chamber and are collected and measured by the sensor. The 
remainder of the ions, for example the non-oxygen ions, remain in 
the filter and do not migrate to the sensor. It is these remainder, or unselected, ions that do not 
migrate to the sensor that cause problems with the stability and 
sensitivity of the mass spectrometer. Under normal operation, 
these unselected ions contact the filter elements, pick up 
electrons from those elements to become neutralized, and 
eventually migrate from the filter and are removed from the 
filter chamber by the ion pump. However, continued operation can 
result in a build up of these unselected ions on the filter 
elements that in time creates a dielectric film which prevents 
the
