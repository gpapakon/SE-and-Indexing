<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording method and
apparatus which makes it possible to improve an image
quality and throughput, and more particularly to an ink
jet recording apparatus and its method wherein
characteristics of temperature sensors can be obtained
precisely in a short time.Recording apparatuses, such as a printer, a
copying machine, and a facsimile, each have a
configuration to form an image consisting of dot
patterns on a recording medium such as a sheet of paper
and a plastic sheet on the basis of image information.The recording apparatuses can be classified into
an ink jet type, a wire dot matrix type, a thermal
type, and a laser beam type apparatuses according to
their respective recording methods. The ink jet type
apparatus (an ink jet recording apparatus) among them
has a configuration in which ink droplets (recording
droplets) are ejected and sprayed from ejection outlets
of its recording heads so as to be deposited on the
recording medium in recording.Recently, a lot of types of recording apparatuses 
are used. They are, however, required to provide high-speed
recording, high resolution, quality images, and
lower noises. The above ink jet recording apparatus
can satisfy these requirements. Among them there is an
ink jet recording apparatus in which heat energy is
given to ink in a nozzle to cause bubbles, so that the
ink is ejected from the recording head by the expansion
force for recording. Temperature management of the
recording head is very important to stabilize the ink
ejection and the ejection quantity necessary to satisfy
the above requirements.Therefore, in the conventional ink jet recording
apparatuses, there has been used a procedure for
controlling temperatures of recording heads so as to be
within a required range on the basis of recording head
temperatures detected by a so-called closed loop
method in which a head temperature is detected by a
temperature detecting means fit to a recording head
portion or by a temperature calculation method in which
a head temperature history is presumed by calculation
from energy applied to the head, or by both methods.As an example of a correction procedure for the
above temperature detecting method, in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 5-31906, values used for
calculation (for example, tables) are corrected by
using a difference between a temperature detected in a
thermally stabilized status by the temperature 
detecting means on the recording head and the
calculated temperature presumed by calculation. In
