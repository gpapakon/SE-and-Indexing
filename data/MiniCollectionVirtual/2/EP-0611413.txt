<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to subsea well 
structures, and in particular to a method for remotely 
monitoring pressure in a subsea tubular member. A need exists to periodically monitor the pressure 
in certain tubular members in subsea well installations. 
For example, in one type or subsea well, an outer 
wellhead housing will enclose an inner wellhead housing. 
The inner wellhead housing directly supports casing, 
tubing and the like which is subject to high pressure. 
The annulus surrounding the casing is normally not under 
any pressure. The annulus surrounding the casing 
communicates with the interior of the inner wellhead 
housing. In the event of leakage in this casing, the 
inner wellhead housing would be subjected to pressure. Checking the pressure in the inner wellhead housing 
would indicate whether or not any casing leakage has 
occurred. In the prior art, this is not often done 
because installing a pressure sensor would require 
drilling a hole through the side wall of the inner 
wellhead housing. Wires would have to be provided to a 
surface platform. Because of the possibility of 
leakage, operators prefer to avoid drilling holes 
through the side wall of the wellhead housing. Also, an 
assembly of this nature requires maintaining electrical 
lines for the pressure sensor. From United States Patent 5,019,814 it is known to 
optically couple data from telemetry gathering circuitry  
 
(rotating system) mounted on and in a rotating shaft to 
a stationary system positioned adjacent the shaft. Also 
shown by the patent is the use of the light source 
powered by the stationary system to supply power to the 
rotating system. In the specific case of torque 
monitoring, the rotating system uses a strain gauge 
detection of stress relating to torque applied to the 
shaft. From United States Patent 3,905,010, the 
communication of data from sensing equipment placed at 
the bottom of a well is known. In this invention, the pressure is monitored by a 
stationary unit that mounts to the exterior of the 
tubular member, such as an inner wellhead housing, in 
which pressure is to be monitored. The sensor is 
preferably a strain gage that will monitor tensile 
strain in the tubular member that would occur if there 
was an increase in pressure. The strain gage connects to an oscillator for 
varying the frequency of the oscillator depending upon 
the strain sensed by the strain gage. This variance is 
compared with a reference oscillator also mounted to the 
exterior of the wellhead housing. The

Apparatus for optical data coupling from a tubular 
member (11) having a first portion (15) mounted to the 

tubular member and including a stress sensor (21), 
circuitry connected to the stress sensor for providing 

an electrical indication correlating with a physical 
effect applied to the sensor, a photocell (37) connected 

to the circuitry for powering the circuitry, and a light 
emitter (33) connected to the circuitry for emitting 

light pulses that correlate with the electrical 
indication, and a second portion (19) comprising a light 

source (45) for applying a light beam to the photocell, 
and a phototransistor (51) for receiving the li

electrical signal correlating with the electrical 
indication, characterised in that the first portion is 

positioned underwater and with the stress sensor is 
mounted on the exterior of the tubular member, the 

electrical indication generated by the stress sensor 
corresponds to a level of overpressure within the 

tubular member, and the second portion is movable to 
allow lowering of the second portion into the sea to a 

position adjacent the first portion to activate and to 
receive signals from the first portion. 
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the 
electrical indication provided by the circuitry to the 

light emitter varies in frequency as a function of the 
level of overpressure in the tubular member. 
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
stress sensor is a strain gage mounted to the exterior  

 
of the tubular member whereby stress induced by internal 

overpressure in the tubular member is detected. 
The apparatus according to claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
the light source is a laser. 
A method for measuring pressure in a subsea tubular 
member (11), comprising in combination: 


mounting a stationary unit (15) to the exterior of 
the tubular member; 
lowering a movable unit (19) into the sea adjacent 
the tubular member; 
emitting light from the movable unit to the 
stationary unit; 
converting the light received from the movable unit 
to electrical power in the stationary unit; 
sensing strain in the tubular wall of the tubular 
member and converting the strain sensed into an 

electrical signal by using the electrical power; 
emitting light pulses from the stationary unit to 
the movable unit that correlate with the electrical

receiving the light pulses from the stationary unit 
and converting the light pulses into an electrical 

indication to enable the pressure in the tubular member 
to be determined.

converting the strain sensed into an electrical signal 

comprises: 

varying an oscillator frequency in accordance with 
strain sensed; 
comparing the oscillator frequency to a reference 
frequency; and  

 
emitting the light pulses at a frequency 
proportional to the difference between the oscillator 

frequency and the reference frequency.
