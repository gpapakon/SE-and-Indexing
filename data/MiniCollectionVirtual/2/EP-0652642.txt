<ABSTRACT>
A phase-locked loop circuit with holdover mode is formed utilizing a 
primary (3) and secondary (4) phase-locked loop circuits. Each loop circuit 

comprises a phase detector (20;60), loop filter (30;20), VCXO (40;80) and frequency 
divider (50;90). The secondary loop (4) is configured such that its output is very 

stable. The primary loop (3) is phase-locked on a received reference clock signal 
(Vref) and the second loop (4) is phase locked on the output (V0,N1) of the primary 

loop, the scaled output of the secondary loop being parallel to the reference clock 
signal. If the incoming reference signal is interrupted or lost the circuit is switched 

(by 8,10) to a holdover mode where the input (21) of the primary loop is switched to 
the stable scaled output of the secondary loop. In holdover mode, the output of the 

primary loop is phase-locked to the stable output of the secondary loop. When the 
reference clock signal is reestablished, the input of the primary loop is switched back 

(by 8,10) to the reference clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to frequency synthesizer
circuits.Phase-locked loop ("PLL") circuits have been used for
many years and are electronic circuits for locking an
oscillator in phase with a reference signal. PLL circuits
are often utilized within receivers in digital
communication systems for the purpose of generating a
local clock signal which is phase aligned with an incoming
reference signal. The phase aligned local clock signal
facilitates the receipt and processing of synchronous data
sent by a transmitter in the communication system.A conventional PLL circuit comprises a phase
detector, a filter and a voltage-controlled oscillator
("VCO"). In the conventional PLL circuit, the phase
detector compares the incoming reference signal and the
output of the VCO. The phase detector generates an error
signal that is representative of the phase difference of
the reference signal and the VCO output. The error signal
is filtered and applied to the control input of the VCO to
produce an output signal that tracks the phase of the
reference signal.A potential problem exists for a PLL circuit used to
generate a local clock signal for synchronous reading of a
transmitted information stream, when the incoming
reference signal is lost or interrupted. The output
frequency of the VCO may drift during the absence of the
reference signal, potentially causing a receiver to read
data in the received information stream out of
synchronization. Several prior art techniques have been devised to
provide an in-phase local clock signal during the period
of absence or interruption of an incoming reference
signal. U.S. Patent No. 4,972,442 to Steierman, issued on
November 20, 1990, described a PLL circuit utilizing
multiple reference signals. This prior art circuit can
detect a loss of the incoming reference signal and
transparently switch over to one of the other reference
signals. A disadvantage of the circuit of U.S. Patent No.
4,972,422 is that it is not applicable to communication
systems having a single reference signal.Another prior art technique utilizes a PLL having a
voltage-controlled oscillator which employs a crystal
maintained at a constant temperature so that a phase-locked
clock signal having minimal drift is provided. A
disadvantage of this prior art technique is the high power
consumption required to maintain the crystal at the
constant temperature.It is desirable to have a PLL scheme with switchover
that could substantially maintain a phase-locked signal
upon an absence or interruption of the reference signal.
