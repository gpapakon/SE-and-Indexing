<ABSTRACT>
A tool holder (9), in particular a quick-release chuck, for taps has a receptacle (11) with head (14) and a housing (12) in the head (14) for accommodating a quick-change insert with tool, at least one driving body (36) sitting between head (14) and housing (12). The driving body (36) is held in a longitudinal groove (37) in the head and a longitudinal groove (38) in the housing, serves to transmit torque between the two and can roll during the relative displacement between head (14) and housing (12). The driving body (36) is arranged between head (14) and housing (12) in such a way as to be free of guidance with regard to its position in the longitudinal direction and is acted upon from outside to inside with an applied pressure by means of an elastic clamping member (39), in particular an elastically flexible, encircling annular part (42). The chuck is simple, compact, short in overall length, light and inexpensive.

Tool holder, in particular quick release chuck, preferably for cutting threads, 
shaping threads or the like, with a mounting (11), which can be mounted at one 

end (13) in a machine shaft, tool mount or the like, and at the opposite end has a 
head (14) comprising a coaxial, cylindrical opening (16) in which a housing (12) is 

mounted and guided non-rotatably, but displaceably in axial longitudinal direction, 
which housing contains a coaxial cylindrical opening (24) into which a quick 

release insert (26) for a tool (27) can be inserted and coupled therewith, whereby 

between the head (14) and the housing (12) at least one driving body (36), e.g. a 
ball, is arranged which is partly held in an assigned longitudinal groove (37) of the 

head (14) and partly in an assigned longitudinal groove (38) of the housing (12), 
which serves to transfer torque between the two and can roll on the relative 

displacement between the head (14) and housing (12), whereby the at least one 
driving body (36, 36', 36'', 36''') is arranged guide-free between the head (14) and 

the housing (12) with respect to its position in longitudinal direction and is 
surrounded by an annular part which at least partly surrounds the head (14) on its 

outside (41) in the region of the at least one driving body (36, 36' 36'', 36''') and 
can lie outside on the projecting part of the at least one driving body,
characterised in that
 
the annular part is designed as an elastic peripheral prestressing element (42) 

which loads the at least one driving body (36, 36', 36'', 36''') from the outside 
inwards with a pressing force and is designed to be elastically resilient.  

 
Tool holder according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the at least one driving body (36, 36', 36'', 36''') passes transversely through an 

assigned longitudinal slot (40) in the head (14) and projects at least slightly over 
the outside (41) of the head (14) in the region of the longitudinal slot (40). 
Tool holder according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the peripheral prestressing element (42) is formed by a ring or a cylindrical sleeve 

made of metal. 
Tool holder according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that
 
the peripheral prestressing element (42) is interrupted in axial longitudinal 

direction at one point. 
Tool holder according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that
 
the at least one longitudinal groove (38, 38', 38'', 38''') of the housing (12) has a 

trapezoid cross section which is symmetrical, whereby the line of symmetry (46) is 
inside a diametrical plane (47) and thus runs through the centre (8) of the housing 

(12). 
Tool holder according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the at
 
least one longitudinal groove (37, 37', 37'', 37''') of the head (14), in particular the 

at least one longitudinal slot (40) has two opposite approximately parallel flanges 
(49, 50), which run inside the plane of a secant line (51, 52) which runs at a radial 

distance from the centre (8) and thus approximately parallel to a diametrical plane 
(53) leading through the centre (8).  

 
Tool holder according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the
 
distance between the Ranges (49, 50) of a longitudinal groove (37, 37', 37'', 37''') 

of the head (14) in particular a longitudinal slot (40) corresponds roughly to the 
diameter of the driving body or is at least slightly larger than the latter. 
Tool holder according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 four
 
longitudinal grooves (37, 37', 37'', 37''') distributed over the periphery are provided 

in the head (14) and assigned longitudinal grooves (38, 38', 38'', 38''') are 
provided in the housing (12) and for each interacting longitudinal groove pair (37, 

38 or 37', 38' or 37'', 38'' or 37''', 38''') a driving body (36, 36', 36'', 36'''), in 
particular a driving ball, is provided.
