<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus (1203, 1403) for embedding 
identification information in documents. The present 

invention embeds information in each copy of a document 

(1207, 1407) such that a particular copy of the document 
is distinguishable from all other copies of the same 

document. Additionally, this embedded information 
(1209, 1301, 1409) is designed to remain intact even if 

the original is copied. A method and apparatus is also 
disclosed to embed verification information in a printed 

document (1207, 1407) such that modification to the text 
subsequent to printing is detectable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to printing documents and in particular 
to modifying the text printed to embed an identification code to 
identify the particular document. Both governments and businesses have a need to identify 
particular copies of secure documents. For governments, the need 
often relates to the control of secret documents. It would be 
useful, for example, to be able to identify who "owned" the 
original document that was copied and given to a foreign agent. If 
the original owner of the original document is identified, then 
remedial steps can be undertaken to prevent the further release of 
classified documents. For businesses, the need is similar. When faced with a copy 
of a confidential document, there is a business need to be able to 
identify the owner of the original. Once the original owner is 
identified the information leak can be traced and stopped. Today 
with the highly competitive markets many businesses face, a leak of 
important research and development information is extremely 
damaging. Identifying documents is not new and the methods used have 
taken many forms. Some examples are, a stamp placed on the 
original, header or footer information printed with the original  
 
text or overprinting, in large type, a light halftone 
identification on each page, such as a serial number. These 
methods are effective but obtrusive and these methods alert those 
copying documents that the documents are marked. In some cases, it 
would be best not to advertise that a document is marked so that 
the copiers will not take measures to obscure the source of the 
copy. A need also exists to be able to verify that a document has 
not been tampered with. With laser printers for example, it is 
possible to remove or add toner to a page and thereby modify the 
contents of the page. So the receiver of a document, or a copy of 
a document, needs a way to verify that the information contained in 
the document is genuine. This need also exists with other print 
technologies such as ink-jet and ribbon printers. There exists therefore a need for a method and apparatus for 
embedding a hidden identification code in a document that allows 
the original document to be identified from a copy and to verify 
that the contents of the document have not been tampered with.  The present invention provides a method and apparatus that 
allows for the embedding of a number for any purpose in an original 
document such that the number can be identified either by examining 
the actual document or a copy of the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for embedding a number in a document 
comprising: 

   a text generator having an output of text 
characters wherein the text characters utilise a base 

font (Fig.1); and 
   a code embedder which embeds a code by modifying 

(Figs. 2-8) the base font (Fig.1) of a text character. 
An apparatus as in claim 1 wherein: 
   the code embedder embeds a code by modifying the 

base font (Fig.1) of a text character by changing the 
size (Fig 8,2) of the character. 
An apparatus as in claim 1 wherein: 
   the code embedder embeds a code by modifying the 

base font (Fig.1) of a text character by changing the 
shape (Fig 2-8) of the character. 
An apparatus as in claim 1 further comprising: 
   a printer (1205,1405) that prints the text 

characters including the text character having an 
embedded code. 
An apparatus for embedding a number in a document 
comprising: 

   a text generator (1203) having an output of text 
characters; and a code embedder which embeds a code by 

changing one of the text characters (Fig 12 "key") 
into a different character (1209). 
An apparatus as in claim 5 further comprising: 
   a printer (1205, 1405) which prints the text 

characters including the character4r (1209, 1411) 
having an embedded code. 
An apparatus for embedding a number in a document 
comprising: 

   a text generator having an output of text 
characters and wherein the text characters form lines 

of text characters and the lines of text characters 
are space vertically apart and the text characters in 

a line are spaced horizontally apart; and 
   a code embedder which embeds a code by changing 

the spacing of a text character (901, 1001) relative 
to a reference. 
An apparatus as in claim 7 wherein: 
   the code embedder embeds a code by changing the 

vertical spacing of a line (1303, 1307) of text 
characters relative to a reference. 
An apparatus as in claim 7 wherein: 
   the code embedder embeds a code by changing the 

horizontal spacing of a text character (901, 1001, 
1105) relative to a reference. 
An apparatus as in claim 7 wherein: 
   the code embedder embeds a code by changing the 

vertical spacing of a text character (1303, 1307) 
relative to a reference. 
An apparatus as in claim 7 further comprising: 
   a printer which prints the output of text 

characters and prints the text character having a 
changed spacing with the changed spacing. 
An apparatus as in claim 7 further comprising: 
   a text verifier generating a check code determined 

by the output of text characters and; 
   the check code is embedded by the code embedder by 

changing the spacing of a text character (Fig.13) 
relative to a reference. 
An apparatus as in claim 5 further comprising: 
   a text verifier generating a check code determined 

by the output of text characters and; 
   the check code is embedded by the code embedder by 

changing one of the text characters (Fig 12 'ker') 
into a different character (1209). 
An apparatus as in claim 1 further comprising: 
   a text verifier generating a check code determined 

by the output of text characters and; 
   the check code is embedded by the code embedder by
