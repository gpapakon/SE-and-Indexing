<ABSTRACT>
A method for disinfecting air in ventilation ducts, on which a non-poisonous and substantially non-volatile disinfectant, in particular a quaternary ammonium complex, is vaporised as an aerosol by means of micro vaporisers into the air flow in the duct, and is allowed to precipitate on the walls of the duct, and in which, furthermore, the air in the duct can be ionised without substantial ozone production, as well as a system for executing this method, comprising an air duct portion (1) with means for disinfecting the air flow (2) therein, comprising an assembly of vaporising nozzles (5) connected, by means of a metering pump (10), to a reservoir (11) for dissolved disinfectant, and a flow meter (3) for controlling the metering pump (10), and, moreover, ionisation electrodes (4) can be provided in the duct (1) which are connected to a high-voltage source, and, at some distance down-flow of these electrodes (4) an ozone sensor (6) is arranged which is connected to control means (8) adapted to control the high-voltage source.

<DESCRIPTION>
When, in closed spaces, air is supplied by means of air 
supply and/or conditioning ducts, it is to be avoided that 
irritating or harmful germs, in particular fungi, algae, 
microbes, viruses and the like, will be introduced into the 
space since they can harm the health or at least the comfort 
of persons present therein. An objection of air filters is that they will generally 
procure an incomplete removal of such germs, so that the 
germs let through can develop further, and, when improving 
the filtering efficiency, the pressure drop over such filters 
will increase accordingly. In the case of moist and warm air 
very favourable conditions for the growth of such germs can 
occur. A good air disinfection is especially important when a 
substantial part of the air introduced into the closed space 
is recycled, as, for instance, in aeroplanes. Eliminating germs by means of poisonous substances is 
not allowed in most countries, if these substances can reach 
the space in which persons are present. EP-A 0 355 765 
discloses a method according to the preamble of present claim 1. The invention provides a method for the above-mentioned 
purpose 
as defined in claims 1 to 3. The non-poisonous disinfectant kills fungi, algae and 
similar organisms, and is active not only in the air flow 
itself, but, by precipitation thereof on the walls of the 
duct, also in a prolonged way on the germs precipitating 
thereon which may return again in the airflow later, so that 
also these germs can be effectively suppressed. When, 
moreover, the air is ionised, not only microbes and viruses 
will be effectively suppressed, but also the vapourised 
disinfectant particles will be charged, so that they will 
deposit faster on the duct walls. When the air flowing 
through the duct is to be moistened, preferably the same 
disinfectant is added to the water used therefor, in order  
 
to counteract thereby the introduction of harmful germs into 
the duct. The system for executing this method is defined in 
claims 4 and 5, the preamble of claim 4 being known from FR-A-2 
414 337. The invention will be elucidated below in more detail 
by reference to a diagrammatic drawing of a non-limiting 
embodiment of a system according to the invention. The system shown in the drawing comprises a part of an 
air ventilation duct 1, the air flow flowing therein being 
indicated by arrows 2. In the duct 1, as seen in the flow sense, are consecutively 
arranged a flow sensor 3, an assembly 4 of particularly 
needle-shaped air ionisation
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for disinfecting air in ventilation ducts, in 
which a non-poisonous and substantially non-volatile disinfectant in 

water, in particular a quaternary ammonium complex, is vaporised into 
the air flow in the duct as an aerosol by means of micro-vaporisers, 


characterised
 in that the air in the duct is ionised without a 
substantial ozone production, and at least the disinfectant particles 

suspended in the air being electrically charged thereby, the walls of 
the duct being kept at substantially ground potential, such that the 

charged suspended particles will deposit faster on said duct walls. 
The method of claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the 
disinfectant is dissolved in an amount of about 0,16 % in water, an 

amount of about 0,06..0,08 ml/m3 being vaporised in the air at an 
over-pressure of about 0,35 MPa at an average vapour particle size of 

about 50 Âµm. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 in that the 
disinfectant is added to water to be used for air moistening. 
A system for executing the method of any one of claims 
1 to 3, comprising an air duct portion (1) with means for disinfecting 

the air flow (2) therein, and an assembly of vaporising nozzles (5) 
connected to a reservoir (11) for dissolved disinfectant connected 

with control means (10), 
characterised
 in that, in the duct (1), 
particularly needle-shaped ionisation electrodes (4) are provided 

which are adapted to ionise the air (2) and charge the vapourised 
disinfectant particles flowing through the duct (1), which electrodes 

(4) are connected to a high-voltage source, and in that at some 
distance down-flow of these electrodes (4) an ozone sensor (6) is 

arranged which is connected to control means (8) adapted to control 
the high-voltage source in such a manner that substantially no ozone 

is produced in the air (2), the walls of the duct (1) being kept 
substantially at ground potential. 
The system of claim 4, 
characterised
 in that, in the 
connection between the nozzles (5) and the reservoir (11), a metering 

pump (16) is included, and in that a flow meter (3) is arranged in 
the duct (1), which is adapted to disconnect the metering pump 

(10) by means of the control means (8) as soon as the air flow (2) 
decreases below a given boundary value, and, if required, to regulate 

the operation of the metering pump (10) as a function of the air flow 
(2).
