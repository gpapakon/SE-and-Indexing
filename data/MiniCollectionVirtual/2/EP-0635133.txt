<ABSTRACT>
A sample analyzer is disclosed for analyzing the characteristics of a plurality of samples. The analyzer includes a movable sample support for holding samples arranged in a first plurality of holders in a sequence for movement in a first direction. An indexing drive for the sample support advances the sample support in the first direction in a set of one or more increments, wherein one increment in the set is a net amount equal to a second plurality of holders greater than one holder and less than the first plurality such that the second plurality is relatively prime with respect to the first plurality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to conveyor
systems. The present invention has a specific application
to conveyor systems for sample analyzers such as chemical
analyzers for testing characteristics of bodily fluids.Automated analyzers for chemical, immunochemical
and/or biological testing of samples taken from patients
are well known. Chemical or physical tests are performed
on biological fluids such as urine, blood serum, plasma,
cerebrospinal fluid and the like. A sample of the fluid is
typically combined with a prepared reagent liquid, buffer
liquid and/or diluting liquid and thereafter maintained at
a controlled temperature until analytical measurements can
be taken, such as by a photometer. For example, the
measurement process analyzes the presence in the original
sample of a given biochemical substance or characteristic.There are several types of automatic sample analyzers.
Preferably, each analyzer occupies a minimum of physical
space, has a high throughput, analyzes dynamic as well as
completed reactions and optimizes the placement of
equipment. One type of analyzer has a plurality of
parallel, simultaneously operating channels, each of which
is arranged to accomplish a specific analysis. The
analyses may be identical, to maximize throughput, or they
may be distinct, to provide a variety of tests. A second
type operates in series having one single processing
channel for carrying out a specific analysis. Samples are
supplied in sequence and analyzed sequentially according to
the specific analysis assigned to the apparatus. In both
of these types of systems, physical positioning of the
various processing apparatus, such as sample load units,
reagent add units, reagent mix units and sample unload
units, is highly constrained for small systems. Such
processing apparatus must be positioned relatively closely 
to one another so that each apparatus can accomplish its
desired function at the proper time in the testing
sequence. For large analyzers, processing apparatus, which
might be spaced further apart physically from one another
because of spacing requirements, often are too far away
from the starting point for a sample to be processed within
the required reaction or sensing time. Therefore, there
are both close physical constraints and time restrictions
on conventional sample analyzers. Limitations created by
unique analysis procedures such as for dynamic reactions
also restrict analyzer design and operation. These
physical and time constraints lower sample throughput and
inhibit the

A sample analyzer (100), for analyzing a plurality of
samples, comprising:-


a movable sample support (102) holding M samples arranged in M
sample holders (104) in a sequence for movement in a first direction, said

samples being arranged in g groups with n samples in each group, so that
M equals the product of g and n;
an indexing drive arrangement (148) that moves the samples in the
sample support in the first direction as a sequence of primary shifts and,

for n 
>
 1, secondary shifts, in which:
each primary shift is a net movement of the sample support in the
first direction by P sample holder positions from a current sample group;
each secondary shift is a net movement of the sample support
within the current sample group;
the values P and M are relatively prime, that is, they have no
factors in common other than unity;
the greatest common factor between the value (P + n -1) and M is
n;
whereby each of the g groups is the current group once before the
sample support returns to an initial position.
An analyzer according to Claim 1, including a photometer (112)
positioned relative to the sample support (102) so as to analyze a

characteristic of the sample whenever a sample is passed before the
photometer; and


a characteristic analyzing arrangement that analyses a predetermined
characteristic of each sample for every advance of the sample support.
An analyzer according to any preceding claim, including a sample 
load station (110) positioned at a first position relative to the sample

support; and

a plurality of operations stations (122,124,126,132,138,140,144,
146) distributed in the first direction in a spatial sequence substantially

uniformly about the movable sample support at defined positions spaced
sequentially in the first direction from the sample load station such that a

given sample to be presented in a time sequence to each operations station

is presented to at least one operations station in a time sequence different
from the spatial sequence of the operations stations.
An analyzer according to any preceding claim, including an empty
sample container insert assembly and a sample scanner spaced from the

empty sample container insert assembly wherein a spacing between the
insert assembly and the sample scanner corresponds to a number of

intervening holders such that a single movement of the indexing drive
arrangement places an empty sample container from the insert assembly

before the scanner to be scanned.
An analyzer according to Claim 4, including a plurality of analysis
stations distributed about the wheel wherein at least one sample holder in

the wheel is not presented to all stations in sequential positional order as
the wheel rotates.
A method for controlling an analyzer for a plurality of samples,
comprising:-


a) in a movable sample support (102), arranging M samples in
M sample holders (1,2,...,90) in g groups with n samples in each group,

so that M equals the product of g and n;
b) moving the samples in the sample support in a first direction
as a sequence of primary shifts, 
c) for n
>
 1, further moving the samples in the sample support
in as a sequence of secondary shifts, in which:
d) each primary shift is a net movement of the sample support
in the first direction by P sample holder positions from a current sample

group;
e) each secondary shift is a net movement of the sample support
within the current sample group;
f) the values P and M are relatively prime, that is, they have
no factors in common other than unity;
g) the greatest common factor between the value (P + n -1) and
M is n; whereby each of the g groups is the current group once before the

sample support returns to an initial position.
A method according to Claim 6, wherein for each primary and
secondary shift, each sample is moved past a detector (112,113) by

moving the sample holder by more than M sample holder positions.
