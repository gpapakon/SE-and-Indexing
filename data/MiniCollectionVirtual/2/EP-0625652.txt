<ABSTRACT>
A compound helically geared transmission (310) of lighter weight and/or 
shorter axial length than comparable prior art transmissions is provided. The 

compound helically geared transmission of the present invention utilizes main and 
auxiliary section countershafts (324, 362) which are coaxial and supported solely 

by bearings in the transmission housing (316) forward and rearward end walls 
(316A, 316B). The mainshaft (362) is supported solely by tapered surfaces at the 

forward and rearward ends thereof, which abut complimentary tapered surfaces on 
or carried by the rearward end of the input shaft (318) and forward end of the 

output shaft (358).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to EP-A-0 628 749 titled
COMPOUND TRANSMISSION, assigned to the same assignee,
Eaton Corporation, as the application and having the same
priority.The present invention relates to an improved helically
geared compound mechanical change gear transmission
structure, preferably for vehicular compound transmissions
of the multiple substantially identical countershaft type.
In particular, the present invention relates to an improved,
helically geared, compound mechanical transmission
structure allowing, for a given transmission capacity and
life, the provision of a lighter, axially shorter and/or
less costly transmission as compared to comparable prior
art transmission structures.Compound change gear transmissions, usually vehicular
transmissions for heavy duty vehicles, of the type having
one or more auxiliary sections connected in series with a
main transmission section are well known in the prior art.
Briefly, by utilizing main and auxiliary transmission
sections connected in series, assuming proper sizing of
the ratio steps, the total of available transmission
ratios is equal to the product of the main and auxiliary
section ratios. By way of example, at least in theory, a 
compound change gear transmission comprising a four (4)
forward speed main section connected in series with a
three (3) speed auxiliary section will provide twelve (4 x
3 = 12) available forward ratios.Auxiliary transmission sections are of three general
types: range type, splitter type or combined range/splitter
type.In compound transmissions having a range type auxiliary
section, the auxiliary section ratio step or steps
are greater than the total ratio coverage of the main
transmission section ratios used in both ranges and the
main section is shifted progressively through its ratios
in each range. Examples of compound transmissions having
range type auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,105,395; 2,637,222 and 2,637,221.In compound transmissions having a splitter type
auxiliary section, the ratio steps of the splitter auxiliary
section are less than the ratio steps of the main
transmission section and each main section ratio is split,
or subdivided, by the splitter section. Examples of compound
change gear transmissions having a splitter type
auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,290,515; 3,799,002; 4,440,037 and 4,527,447.In a combined range and splitter type auxiliary
section, or sections, both range and splitter type ratios
are provided allowing the
