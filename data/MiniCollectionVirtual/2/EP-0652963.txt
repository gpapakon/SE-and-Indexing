<ABSTRACT>
A cloning and/or sequencing vector (1) comprises, incorporated in an autonomous replication vector (2), at least one nucleotide promoter sequence (3) and at least one nucleotide sequence (4) coding for a fusion protein active as a poison. Said nucleotide sequence (4) is obtained by fusion of a coding nucleotide sequence (5), comprising several unique cloning sites and a nucleotide sequence (6) coding for a poison protein. The vector host cell of the invention is also disclosed.

<CLAIMS>
Cloning and/or sequencing vector which is characterized 
in that it includes, incorporated into an autonomously 

replicating vector (2), at least one promoter 
nucleotide sequence (3) and at least one nucleotide 

sequence (4) which encodes a fusion protein which is 
active as a poison, the said nucleotide sequence (4) 

being obtained by fusing a coding nucleotide sequence 
(5), which comprises several unique cloning sites, and a 

nucleotide sequence (6) which encodes a protein poison. 
Vector according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the autonomously replicating vector (2) is a recombinant 

virus. 
Vector according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the autonomously replicating vector (2) is a recombinant 

plasmid. 
Vector according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the autonomously replicating vector (2) is a recombinant 

pUC plasmid. 
Vector according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the promoter nucleotide 

sequence (3) consists of the 
lac
 operon promoter. 
Vector according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the unique cloning sites of 

the nucleotide sequence (5), which is fused to the 
nucleotide sequence (6) which encodes the protein poison, 

are absent on the remainder of the nucleotide sequence of 
the cloning vector. 
Vector according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the nucleotide sequence (6)  

 
which encodes a protein poison comprises all or part of 

the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type gene which 
encodes the protein CcdB. 
Vector according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the nucleotide sequence (6) which encodes the 

protein poison lacks the cleavage site for the restriction 
enzyme SmaI. 
Vector according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it corresponds to deposition 

No. LMBP2781. 
Procaryotic cell which is transformed with the 
cloning vector according to any one of the preceding 

claims. 
Procaryotic host cell comprising the cloning 
vector according to any one of the preceding Claims 1 to 

9, characterized in that it preferably possesses a 
chromosomal I
q
 and an increased transformation efficiency 
and possesses a mutation which confers resistance to the 

poisonous activity of the fusion protein and/or possesses 
a gene which encodes a protein which is an antipoison to 

the fusion protein. 
Procaryotic host cell according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that it possesses a mutation in the gene 

encoding subunit A or in the gene encoding subunit B of 
the gyrase, conferring resistance to the fusion protein, 

and/or possesses a gene which encodes the protein CcdA 
which is the antipoison to the fusion protein. 
Cell according to Claim 11 or 12, characterized 
in that it is a Escherichia coli possessing a mutation 

which is responsible for replacing arginine 462 with a 
cysteine in the amino acid sequence of the GyrA polypeptide 

of the gyrase, thereby conferring resistance to the  
 

fusion protein. 
Cell according to any one of Claims 11 to 13, 
characterized in that it possesses the 
Lacl
q
 mutation. 
Cell according to any one of the preceding Claims 
11 to 14, characterized in that it is deposited under No.
