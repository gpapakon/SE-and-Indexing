<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a drawer runner having telescopic 
rods sliding on balls, and consisting of extruded aluminium 

tubular sections (1,2,3). 
The rods are characterized by a rhomboidal tubular section 
having arched sides, sliding in another tubular section 

having a square cross-section and rounded edges, so as to 
form four identical sliding tracks for the balls (7), staggered 

at 90°, and delimited externally by the rounded corners of 
the external section and internally by the arched sides of 

the internal section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This design patent application concerns a drawer runner 
having telescopic rods sliding on balls, and consisting of 
extruded aluminium tubular sections. Current standard runners for drawers, or more generally, 
for furniture pull-outs sliding on wheels, consist of two 
pressed sheet plate sections - a box shaped section that is 
fixed inside the side panels of the drawer while the other 
section is housed and slides within the first, and is fixed 
externally to the longitudinal sides of the drawer. Telescopic type runners are also available on the market, 
but the only difference with respect to standard runners, 
is that they have a third box-shaped section fitted between 
the first box-shaped section screwed to the side panels of 
the drawer and the second section, screwed on the exterior 
of the longitudinal sides of the drawer. In all cases said box-shaped sections are characterized by 
a transverse "C" cross-section.  
 Recently groups of balls have been used instead of the 
traditional nylon wheels, in an attempt to improve sliding. 
In these models the steel balls are housed and slide in 
pairs of overlying semi-cylindrical tracks on the 
interfaced longitudinal edges of the sections.  
 Patent GB-A 659.534 describes a telescopic furniture runner 
consisting of three metal sections sliding on each other and 
provided with interposing balls or wheels. Patent US-A 4.030.609 describes a telescopic furniture runner 
consisting of three overlying metal sections, whose 
intermediate section is partially inserted in the other two 
external sections, having an almost square cross-section 
containing a series of cylindrical rollers which help the 
intermediate section to slide within the external sections.  
 One of the main problems common to all said runner models 
for drawers sliding on wheels or balls is that they have a 
low resistance to supporting and opposing transverse, 
horizontal or sub-horizontal strain; in other words, 
although said wheels or balls ensure adequate support and 
runner action for the weight of the drawer, they do not 
adequately support lateral pressure on the right or left of 
the drawer which can easily occur when opening and closing 
the drawer. The purpose of this invention is to develop a new runner 
model with telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs that 
guarantees constant supporting and runner capacity 
regardless of the direction of the load pressure applied to 
the pull-out. This has been possible thanks to a special profiling of the 
transverse section of the

<CLAIMS>
A runner having telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs, 
consisting of tubular sections in extruded aluminium coupled 

together and provided with interposing balls 
which facilitate sliding between one tubular section and another, 

characterised by three overlying tubular sections (1, 2 and 3) 
fitted into each other and provided with interposing open collars 

(8) housing balls (7) which roll along four longitudinal channels, 
one part being constituted by the interior walls of the external tubular section 

having a square cross-section and rounded edges, and the 
other part being constituted by the external walls of the internal tubular section 

having rhomboidal cross-section and arched sides wherein 

the first section (1), namely that fixed to the drawer, is 
provided with a flat flange (1a) connected by ribbing (1b) to a 

tubular element (1c), having a rhomboidal cross-section with 
four identical angles and four arched sides:  

 
the second section (2) is provided with a tubular element 
identical to the tubular element (1c) of the first section (1), which is connected at the bottom 

by means of ribbing (2b) to another element (2a) with a square 
cross-section and rounded edges which element has a centre slot (2d) 

on its base through which the ribbing (1b) of section (1) passes; 
the third section, namely that fixed to the pull-out unit, is 
provided with a tubular element (3a), with side, upper and 

bottom walls, identical to the square cross section element (2a) of the second section (2), but 
having side walls which extend upwards to connect with a horizontal flap 

(3f) below which the upper wall of the tubular element (3a) of the third section is 
closed and concealed; 
each collar (8) comprises a longitudinal slot (8a) and is 
provided with four rows of regularly spaced holes staggered at 

90°, housing the balls (7) which roll in four longitudinal sliding 
channels, one part of the sliding channels being constituted by the arched sides of the 

tubular elements with rhomboidal cross-section (1c and 2c) and 
the other part of the sliding channels being constituted by the rounded edges of the tubular elements with 

square cross-section (2a and 3a). 
A runner having telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs, 
consisting of tubular sections in extruded aluminium, 

according to claim 1), characterized in that section (3) is 
fixed to the pull-out and by a fourth section (4) 

consisting of an "L" shaped square whose vertical flange 
(4a) is fixed by means of screws to the pull-out, while its 

horizontal flange (4b) is fixed by means of a fast hooking 
and release device, to flange (3f) of section (3). 
A runner having telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs, 
consisting of tubular elements in extruded aluminium 

according to claim 2 characterized in that the 
fast hooking and release device 

includes a pair of substantially rectangular stop knobs (5), 
idling around a respective centre pin (6), screwed above 

flange (3f) of section (3); the horizontal flange (4b) of 
the "L" square (4) having a slot (4c) with the same plan as 

the knobs (5), at both its ends. 
A runner having telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs, 
consisting of tubular sections in extruded aluminium 

according to claim 1), characterized in that the lateral  
 

walls of the square cross-sectional tubular element (2a) extend downwards by means 
of two vertical flanges (2e), whose bottom edge touches the 

base (1a) of section (1) and in that the lateral walls of 
tubular element (3a) of the third section extend downwards by means of two 

vertical flanges (3e), whose bottom edge touches and aligns 
with the lateral walls of the element (2) of the second section. 
A runner having telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs, 

consisting of tubular elements in extruded aluminium, 
according to claim 1), characterised by comprising as the endplates of the 

sliding run for one section with respect to another, two 
plates (9a and 9b), each terminating at one end with an 

ovoidal head and at the other with a fork having an 
internally concave profile conforming to the externally 

convex profile of the above head, so that the head of the 
plate enters and fixes to the fork of another plate; plate 

(9a) being screwed externally above and at the end of the 
tubular elements (1c and 2c), while plate (9b) is screwed 

internally and at the end of the tubular elements (2a and 
3a). 
A runner having telescopic rods for furniture pull-outs,
