<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing paper from sugar-beet pulp, 
comprising the steps of drying the integral sugar-beet 

pulp, grinding the dried pulp to a particle size of from 
0.1 to 500 µm, adding the pulp to cellulose mix to make 

paper and converting the mixture in paper in a papermaking 
machine. Also the present invention relates to paper 

obtained from the above-described process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a process for
manufacturing paper using integral sugar-beet pulp. The
following description refers especially to paper, though
the process described is equally useful for the
manufacture of cardboard which is therefore included as
part of this invention.In the manufacturing process of sugar from sugar-beet,
the beet passes through automatic slicers that reduce it
into small and thin triangular-shape strips (cossettes) to
facilitate extraction of the sugar-content.The beet-cell walls are scarcely permeable to the
components of the solution inside the cell, but at 60°C
they contract and can be extracted by means of water to
obtain a raw sugar solution (raw juice) and a solid
residual of exhausted cossettes (sugar-beet pulp).The sugar-beet pulp is usually pressed to remove the
excess water that swells it, then it is treated to prevent
fermentation, dried and utilised whenever possible as
supplements for livestock feed.By considering that about 1.5 million tons (dry basis)
of sugar-beet pulp are produced every year in Italy alone,
it is easy to understand the interest in finding other
uses for this product. Such uses must facilitate its
consumption and at the same time offer possible economical
exploitation.To the Applicant's knowledge, nobody up to now has used
this integral sugar-beet pulp as such directly as a
substitute of cellulose or other components of paper, as
for example the mineral fillers, for manufacturing paper.The present invention utilize the sugar-beet pulp in
its integral form for manufacturing paper, and this
represents a fundamental aspect of the present invention. Recently, the Applicant described in EP-A-0 565 920 (priority of 16.04.92 and published 20.10.93)
a paper-manufacturing
process which foresees the use of integral seaweed.From FR-A-2 359 920 there is known a process for the production of a material from sugar beet pulp. The beet pulp is micronized to a size of between 0.1-10 mm, whereafter it is pressed and heat heated to obtain a sheet which can be used as e.g. feed stock for animals.Continuing research on the potential use of natural and
vegetable substances, particularly the low-cost waste
materials deriving from other manufacturing processes, for
paper manufacturing, the Applicant has now found it
possible to utilise advantageously sugar-beet pulp.The latter is used in part or in total substitution of
mineral fillers normally put in paper and in substitution
of part of the actual cellulose. According to the
invention, the paper, therefore,

<CLAIMS>
Process for making paper containing integral sugar-beet
pulp comprising the following steps:


a) the sugar-beet pulp is dried at a temperature lower than 150°C to a residual water content of less than 20% in weight and is then micronised by
food-flour micronising systems and sifted to reduced

particle sizes of between 0.1 and 500 µm;
b) this micronised sugar-beet pulp is added, in quantities
of 1% to 50% in weight of the cellulose mix to make the

paper and the mix thus obtained is converted into paper in
the paper-machine.
Process as per claim 1 characterised by the fact
that the sugar-beet pulp is micronised in water in order

to obtain suspensions with a 1% to 70% dry substance and these suspensions are pasteurised or irradiated to prevent fermentation.
Process as per claim 1 characterised by the fact
that the sugar-beet pulp is micronised to a reduced particle size of from 1 to 100µm.
Process as per claim 1 characterised by the fact
that the sugar-beet pulp is mixed with quantities of from 1% the 30% of substances which reduce the water solubility of the components in that sugar-beet pulp.
Process as per claim 4 characterised by the fact that said substances are selected from the group consisting of starches, partly cationised starches, aluminium salts, in particular sulphate and polychloride, iron sulphate, cationising substances and their mixtures.
Paper obtainable according to any of claims 1 to 5.
Paper as per claim 7 characterised by the fact that
it contains from 5% to 40% in weight (on dry basis) of

that sugar-beet pulp. 
Paper as per claim 7 characterised by the fact that
said particle size is of between 1 and 100 µm.
Use of paper as per claim 6
as a supplement for livestock feed.
