<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic probe 10 includes an elongated housing 
12 which contains a window 24 surrounding an ultrasonic 

transducer 32. The ultrasonic transducer 32 is mounted 
on a first platform 36. The first platform 36 is in turn 

mounted on a second platform 38. A motor 44 and linkage 
arrangement 48 is provided for pivoting the transducer 

32. A thumb wheel 16 can rotatably position the 
transducer 32 as it pivots, allowing ultrasonic imaging 

of bodily tissue through three hundred and sixty degrees. 
Further, a position sensor 78 allows for accurate sensing 

of the position of the transducer 32 as the transducer 32 
pivots and rotates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ultrasonic probes 
and in particular to ultrasonic probes used for human 
intracavity examination. One of the several presently available noninvasive 
techniques for examining humans, as well as other animate 
and inanimate objects, includes the use of ultrasound to 
produce ultrasonic images of portions of the human bodily 
tissues which would otherwise be inaccessible except by 
surgical techniques. Ultrasound devices generally 
require the use of probes which can be applied either 
externally or internally with resect to the body in order 
to produce the appropriate image. Quite naturally, with 
probes that must be applied internally, it is important 
that the probe be made as small as possible so that the 
probes can be accommodated in the cavity, whether the 
cavity is that possessed by an infant or a fully grown 
adult. An ultrasonic scanning probe is able to sample data 
so that an image can be made of a cross-sectional slice 
or plane through the body. Prior devices have been 
designed as elongated probes which have the capability of 
either taking an image representing a slice along the 
length of the probe or transverse to the length of the  
 
probe. The image is accomplished by causing an 
ultrasonic transducer to scan back and forth in the plane 
of the image. Prior devices have also been able to take 
an image by use of a fixed ultrasonic transducer which is 
located at the tip of the probe. Additionally, biplanar 
devices include both a scanning ultrasonic transducer for 
taking an image which is transverse to the probe and also 
a fix ultrasonic transducer for taking an image along an 
axial or longitudinal plane. The disadvantage of the first several probes which 
only allow for presenting an image in one plane, is that 
often times there is a requirement to present an image in 
another plane whether that plane be perpendicular to the 
first plane or at an oblique angle to the first plane. 
Thus, in order to accomplish this task, multiple probes 
are required. In the case of the biplanar probe, only 
two perpendicular views are presented, and no oblique 
views are possible. Further, it is to be understood that 
the two ultrasonic transducers in the biplaner probe are 
not positioned in the same location on the probe. Thus, 
in order to take images in two directions at the same 
position in the human body, the probe must be moved so 
that one and then the second sensor is properly 
positioned. Other examples of ultrasound equipment are disclosed
