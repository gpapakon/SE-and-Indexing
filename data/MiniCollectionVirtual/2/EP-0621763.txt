<ABSTRACT>
A method for refractive correction of the eye in order to improve the vision of the eye while not adversely affecting its natural asphericity is described. The method involves determining the amount of correction necessary, selecting an intrastromal corneal ring (ICR) (47) of appropriate thickness to obtain the necessary correction from a selection of ICRs of varying thickness, and inserting the ICR (47) into the corneal stroma (32). The method may be useful for the correction of myopia and excessive astigmatism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the general field of medical
technology and relates specifically to implants useful in
varying corneal curvature in order to correct vision problems.Anomalies in the shape of the eye can cause
visual disorders. Hyperopia occurs when the eyeball
is too short. In such a case, parallel rays from
greater than 6.1m (20 feet) focus behind the retina. Myopia,
on the other hand occurs when the eyeball is too long.
The focus of parallel rays in this case is in front of
the retina. Astigmatism is a condition in which the
parallel rays of light do not come to a single point,
but rather have a variable focus due to the fact that
the cornea is aspherical and refracts light in a
different meridian at different distances. Some
degree of astigmatism is normal, but where it is too
high, it must often be corrected.Hyperopia, myopia and astigmatism are
usually corrected by glasses or contact lenses.
Surgical methods for the correction of such disorders
have been cited in the literature and include radial
keratotomy (see e.g. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,815,463 and
4,688,570) and laser corneal oblation (see e.g. U.S.
Patent No. 4,941,093). Further, the general method of
implanting rings in the corneal stroma to change the
curvature of the cornea is known. Previous work
involving the implantation of polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA) rings, allograft corneal tissue and hydrogels
is well documented. One of the ring devices involves
a ring design that allows a split ring to be inserted
into a channel dissected in the stromal layer of the
cornea using a minimally invasive incision through
which the channel for the implant is created and
through which the implant is inserted and adjusted.
Adjustment of the device normally involves an
adjustment of ring size or diameter.U.S. Patent No. 4,452,235, D1 Reynolds describes a
method and apparatus for corneal curvature adjustment.
The method involves inserting one end of a split end
adjusting ring into the cornea of the eye and moving
the ring in a circular path until its ends meet. The
ends are thereafter adjusted relative to each other
until the shape of the eye has assumed a desired
curvature whereupon the ends are fixedly attached to
maintain the desired curvature of the cornea.GB-A-2095119 describes a space maintainer (e.g.
ring) for use in a circular kerototomy surgical procedure.
The space maintainer is inserted in an incision cut in the
cornea of an eye of a patient. The incision circumscribes
the optical zone of the eye to cause the cornea to flatten.
