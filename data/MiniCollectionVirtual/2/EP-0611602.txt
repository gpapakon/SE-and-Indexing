<ABSTRACT>
A self-propelled crushing 
machine comprising a cab 

(13), a hopper (11), a crusher 
(8) connected to said hopper 

and a power source (10) mounted 
on a vehicle body (1) provided 

with a travelling equipment 
(19), wherein the crusher 

(8) is provided at an intermediate 
portion in the longitudinal 

direction of the vehicle body 
(1), said hopper (11) is provided 

in the front of said crusher 
and said power source (10) is 

provided at the back of said 
crusher, respectively, and said 

cab (13) is provided at one side 
of said crusher and a motor 

(24) for the crusher is provided 
at the other side of said crusher. 

With this arrangement, positions 
of the hopper (11), the 

power source (10) and the motor 
(24) for the crusher are lowered, 

respectively, to thereby lower the total height of the crushing machine, so that, when the crushing machine is transported on 
the platform of a truck, the crushing machine does not exceed the height limit so as not to pose a transportation problem, and the 

hopper (11) is provided in the forward portion of the vehicle body (1) so as not to obstruct the cab (13), thereby improving the efficiency 
of the loading operation for loading a crushed material into the hopper by a loader.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-propelled 
crushing machine for crushing a object of crush, such as a 
concrete waste and so forth in a site of taking down a 
building or so forth. As conventional self-propelled crushing machine, 
there has been known the machine, in which an operator's 
cabin, a hopper, a crusher and a driving power source and so 
forth are mounted on a vehicular chassis provided with a 
pair of left and right traveling bodies, and a discharge 
conveyer is provided beneath the vehicular chassis in 
riseable fashion, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Utility Model Publication No. 64-32744 and Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 63-77553. These self-propelled crushing machines can travel 
by themselves and can finely crush the objects of crush, 
such as the concrete wastes and so forth charged in the 
hopper, and discharge the crushed pieces out of the 
vehicler chassis through the discharge conveyer. The self-propelled crushing machine disclosed in  
 
the first-mentioned publication has the operator's cabin at 
the front side of the vehicular chassis, the crusher at the 
longitudinal intermediate portion of the vehicular chassis 
and the driving power source at the rear postion of the 
vehicular chassis. A charging inlet of the hopper connected 
to the crusher is positioned above the operator's cabin so 
that the hopper projects above the operator's cabin to make 
the overall height of the crushing machine tall. This 
results in excess in height limit when the crushing machine 
is transported by loading on the rear chassis or carrier of 
a truck to cause a difficulty in transportation. Also, 
since the charging inlet of the hopper is located above the 
operator's cabine, the operator's cabin may obstruct 
charging of the object of crush by a loading machine, such 
as a power shovel and so forth from the front side of the 
vehicle to cause degradation of efficiency of charging 
operation. Also, in the self-propelled crushing machine 
disclosed in the later-mentioned publication, since a part 
of the discharge conveyer extends outside of the vehicular 
chassis from the side of the driving power source, which 
requires a vertical clearance between the driving power 
source and the discharge conveyer to pass the object of 
crush to make the height of the driving power source high in 
the extent of the clearance. In addition a motor for the  
 
crusher is mounted above the driving power source. 
Therefore, the overall height of the crushing machine is 
tall to cause the
