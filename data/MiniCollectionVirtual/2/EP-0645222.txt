<ABSTRACT>
The device has a holder (27,28) for the workpiece (1). A drive (20) moves a shaver plate periodically relative to the workpiece. The movement has a component, which is at right angles to the plane of the shaver plate. During the movement, the shaving edge of the plate continuously or intermittently engages on the workpiece surface, and is approx. at right angles to it. The shaving edge is ground at right angles to the sides of the shaving plate. Several shaving plates may be located on one or more common units (17,23), to finish several areas of a workpiece. One unit is connected to a drive, and a second one is not driven directly.

a workpiece with a surface which is curved in a non-uniform manner and which is not 

rotationally symmetrical, at least in the vicinity of one point on the surface, 
characterized 
in that
 a flat scraping blade is set in a periodic movement - relative to the workpiece 
- with a component orientated at right angles to the plane of the scraping blade, 


has a scraping edge brought into contact with the surface continuously or intermittently 
in the vicinity of the point, 
and is held in a position in which it is orientated at least approximately at right angles to 
the surface. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the surface in the vicinity of different 
points is smoothed simultaneously by a plurality of scraping blades. 
A device for smoothing a workpiece of wood or a material similar to wood, in particular 
a workpiece with a surface which is curved in a non-uniform manner and which is not 

rotationally symmetrical, at least in the vicinity of one point, 
characterized by

a drive (20) by which the scraping blade can be set in a periodic movement - relative to 
the workpiece - which has a component at right angles to the plane of the scraping blade, 
and by the fact that the scraping blade occupies a position in which during the periodic 
movement in the vicinity of the point it touches the surface of the workpiece with its 

scraping edge continuously or intermittently and is orientated at least approximately at 
right angles thereto.
