Rotary slide valve for power-assisted steerings of 
motor vehicles, with a first valve element (4) which is 

connected to a valve inlet component (23) so as to be 
incapable of relative rotation, and with a second valve 

element (7) which is connected to a valve outlet component 
(25) so as to be incapable of relative rotation, 


the first valve element (4) being connected to the 
valve outlet component (25) through a torsion rod 

(30) and a backlash coupling (24), 
the two valve elements (4, 7) being disposed 
coaxially within a valve chamber (2) so as to be 

capable of movement one within the other and their 
maximum twisting capability relative to each other 

being the torsional displacement of the backlash 
coupling (24) and 
the radially outer valve element (4) possessing 
inner longitudinal control grooves (20, 21) and the 

radially inner valve element (7) possessing outer 
longitudinal control grooves (20, 21) which are 

limited, at least partially, in their axial length 
and which act together to control a pressure medium 

to and from two working chambers (13, 14) of a 
servomotor (15), 
 
characterized in that 


the first valve element, as an axially outer rotary 
slide valve (4), includes an axial bore (6) within 

which is guided the second valve element, as a 
radially inner control bushing, and in that 
the control bushing (7) consists of a part produced 
without cutting. 
Rotary slide valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the control bushing (7), together with 

its longitudinal control grooves (21) and its control edges, 
is produced by cold forming.  

 
Rotary slide valve according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that one end of the control bushing (7) is 

contained within an axial bore of the valve outlet component 
(25) and held in position by a pin (31). 
Rotary slide valve according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the backlash coupling (24) is 

formed by an inner toothing of the rotary slide valve (4) and 
an outer toothing of the valve outlet component (25). 
Rotary slide valve according to either of Claims 1 or 
2, characterized in that the outer surface of the rotary slide 

valve (4) has annular grooves (8, 10, 11) which are sealed by 
sealing rings (16). 
Rotary slide valve according to either of Claims 1 or 
2, characterized in that the radially inner longitudinal 

control grooves (20) of the rotary slide valve (4) and the 
inner toothing of the backlash coupling (24) are produced by 

cold forming. 
Rotary slide valve according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the rotary slide valve (4) is mounted 

within the valve chamber (2) by means of two rolling bearings 
(17, 18).
