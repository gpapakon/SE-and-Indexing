<ABSTRACT>
The cylinder lock according to the present invention comprises latch 
means 19 movably disposed between the joint position connecting the key cylinder 

16 and driver means 18 and the release position disengaging the key cylinder 
16 and a driver means 18; and clutch means 20 for transferring the latch 

means 19 to the release position when a sleeve 13 rotates relatively to a 
housing 11 with an improper key. A proper key is inserted into the key 

cylinder 16, it can be rotated without rotation of the sleeve 13 so that the 
driver means 18 can be rotated to the locked or unlocked position through the 

latch means 19 which drivingly connects the key cylinder 16 and the driver 
means 18. When an improper key is inserted into the key cylinder 16 and 

rotated, the sleeve 13 is rotated with the key cylinder 16 through tumblers 17 
so that radial movement of the clutch means 20 disengages the latch means 19 

and driver means 18, thereby preventing unauthorized unlocking of the cylinder 
lock 10 without rotation of the driver means 18.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a lock device and more
particularly, to a cylinder lock highly resistible against its destruction.A conventional cylinder lock has a key cylinder with tumblers disposed
within slots formed in the key cylinder so that these tumblers can be engaged
with or disengaged from a groove formed in a casing of the lock. The key
cylinder may be rotated to a locked or unlocked position by using a proper key
inserted into a key hole of the key cylinder.In the conventional cylinder lock which prevents rotation of the key
cylinder by engagement of the tumblers with the groove of the casing in the
locked position, unauthorized unlocking may be carried out by destroying the
tumblers. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,903,512 discloses a free-turn type
cylinder lock device with a key cylinder which is capable of freely rotating
when a rotative force is applied to the key cylinder for unauthorized unlocking.
The cylinder lock of this type includes a sleeve rotatably disposed in
the casing of the lock and a key cylinder rotatably disposed in the sleeve.When a proper key is inserted into the key hole of the key cylinder, the
tumblers are radially inwardly moved in the slots of the key cylinder away
from the groove formed in the sleeve so that the key cylinder can be rotated
in and relative to the sleeve, and simultaneously a slidable ring engages with
a driver to operate the lock device. When an improper key is inserted into
the key cylinder, they are rotated together with the sleeve due to engagement
of the tumblers with the sleeve so that the driver can not be rotated to 
prevent operation of the lock device. In this way, the free-turn type
cylinder locks are highly resistible against its destruction because no rotational
force can be applied to the tumblers due to free rotation of the key
cylinder when an improper key or any tool is inserted into the key hole of the
key cylinder for the purpose of destruction of the lock.However, the lock disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,903,512 has the disadvantage
that the key cylinder can not be rotated smoothly once an improper key
is inserted and rotated. Specifically, a torsion coil spring is provided
between the front plate and the key cylinder within the lock in order to
automatically return the rotated key cylinder to its initial position. If
an improper key is inserted into the key cylinder and rotated, the sleeve and
the key cylinder are freely rotated together, then the torsion coil spring
produces a resisting force. However, if they

<CLAIMS>
A cylinder lock comprising

a housing having a first hole;
a sleeve rotatably disposed within said first
hole of said housing and having a second hole and a

notch;
a key cylinder rotatably disposed within said
second hole of said sleeve;
tumblers slidably disposed in said key cylinder
for engagement with and disengagement from said notch of

said sleeve;
driver means provided relatively rotatable to
said housing;
latch means movable between the joint position
for connecting said key cylinder and said driver means

and the release position for disengaging the key
cylinder and driver means; 
clutch means radially movably disposed in said sleeve for conveying said
latch means to the release position when said sleeve is moved relative to said

housing; and
a clutch spring for resiliently urging said clutch means toward said
housing;
said housing being formed with a groove which receives a convexity
formed in said clutch means, said convexity of said clutch means being moved

away from said groove of said housing for disengaging said latch means and
said driver means with movement of said clutch means when said sleeve is

rotated relative to said housing.
The cylinder lock of claim 1, wherein said latch means is generally
formed into L-shape which comprises a spring holder and a connector; said

spring holder is urged toward said driver means by a latch spring disposed in
said key cylinder; and said clutch means has a protrusion which axially extends

not to contact said latch means when a proper key is inserted into the
key hole of the key cylinder.
The cylinder lock of claim 1, wherein said latch means is generally
formed into L-shape which comprises a spring holder and a connector; said

spring holder is urged toward said driver means by a latch spring disposed in
said key cylinder; and said 
clutch means has a protrusion which axially extends
to contact said latch means when an improper key is inserted into the

key hole of the key cylinder.
The cylinder lock of claim 1, wherein said latch means includes a connecting
portion disposed within a radial slit formed in said key cylinder for

integral rotation; a column portion coupled with said connecting portion for 
engagement with said clutch means; and a pair of lugs axially extending from said

column portion; said driver means includes a shaft portion; a flange portion formed at
an end of said shaft portion; and a pair of arcuate portions axially prqjecting with a
