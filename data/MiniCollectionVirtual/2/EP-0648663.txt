<ABSTRACT>
Device for spreading the loads between the articulated elements of a public transport vehicle, including at least one front element (1) with two axles (2, 3) and one rear element (4) bearing the motive power unit, the said elements (1, 4) being joined together by an articulation device protected by a bellows (6), characterised in that a ram (7) formed in a way known per se by a body (71) and a rod (72) is fixed to the roof (8) of the vehicle so that the bellows (6) is located under the ram (7), and so that the free end (711) of the body (71) of the ram (7) is fixed to the first element of the vehicle and the free end (721) of the rod (72) of the ram (7) is fixed to an extension (10) of the second element of the vehicle.

<CLAIMS>
A device for distributing loads between the articulated members of a public 
transport vehicle, comprising at least one front member (1) with 
two axles (2, 3) and a 
rear member (4) bearing the drive unit, these members (1, 4) being connected by an 

articulation device protected by a bellows (6) in which a jack (7) formed, in a manner 
known per se, by a body (71) and a rod (72) is secured on the roof (8) of the vehicle 

such that the bellows (6) is located below the jack (7), and wherein the free end (711) of 
the body (71) of the jack (7) is secured to the first member (4) of the vehicle and the free 

end (721) of the rod (72) of the jack (7) is secured to a prolongation (10) of the second 
member (1) of the vehicle, characterised in that the prolongation (10) of the second 

member (1) is formed by a V-shaped support whose branches (101, 103) are secured 
rigidly to this member (1) and whose point (102) is located substantially plumb with the 

axis of articulation (15) of the first and second members (4, 1) and forms the anchoring 
point of the free end (721) of the rod (72) of the jack (7). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the jack (7) is single-acting 
and in that its supply is ensured from a fluid tank of a control circuit for the vehicle 

equipment.
