<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating mechanism (4) for vibrating a vibration compacting 
roller with a variable amplitude includes a vibration 

generating shaft (10), a movable eccentric weight (6a) 
turnably disposed in the vibration generating shaft (10), and 

an eccentric weight driving unit for rotating the eccentric 
weight (6a) about a pivotal shaft (6) transversely extending 

relative to the vibration generating shaft (10). To generate 
vibrations for the vibration compacting roller, a vibration 

generating apparatus including a vibrating mechanism (4) of 
the foregoing type is substantially composed of an 

eccentricity signal generating unit, a vibration mode setting 
unit, an eccentric weight eccentricity quantity detecting 

unit, and an eccentric weight eccentricity quantity 
controlling unit. Alternatively, the vibration generating 

apparatus may substantially be composed of a forward/rearward 
movement lever neutral position detecting unit and an 

eccentric weight eccentricity quantity controlling unit. 
Otherwise, the vibration generating apparatus may 

substantially be composed of a running speed detecting unit, a 
running speed setting unit a running speed comparing unit, and 

an eccentric weight eccentricity quantity controlling unit. 
The eccentric weight eccentricity quantity controlling unit is 

usually composed of a hydraulic cylinder (7), a hydraulic pump 

(47), a connecting rod (18), and solenoid driven change valves 
(42, 44). In addition, a vibration generating method to be 

practiced by operating a vibration generating apparatus of the 
foregoing type is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibrating mechanism
which assures that a movable eccentric weight can simply
be supported in a cylindrical casing thereof, and
moreover, components constituting the vibrating mechanism
can easily be assembled in the cylindrical casing. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
mechanism for vibrating an amplitude variable type
vibration compacting roller with the aid of the foregoing
components. Further, the present invention relates to an
apparatus for generating vibrations for a vibration
compacting roller with a variable amplitude wherein the
apparatus can properly control a quantity of eccentricity
of the gravity center of a movable eccentric weight away
from the center axis of a vibration generating shaft in
the foregoing vibrating mechanism corresponding to given
requirements.Conventionally, a vibrating mechanism of the type for
generating a certain intensity of vibration generating
force by rotating a vibration generating shaft including
a movable eccentric weight to utilize the centrifugal
force induced by the eccentric weight has been often
employed for a vibration utilizing machine such as a
vibration utilizing type soil compacting roller, a
vibration utilizing type pile driving machine or the
like. When a certain given operation is performed using
the vibrating mechanism, it is desirable that an
amplitude of each vibration can be changed corresponding
to given working conditions and so forth.Here, it is assumed that a vibrating mechanism of the
foregoing type is applied to a vibration compacting
roller as a typical example of practical use thereof. To 
achieve a ground surface compacting operation at a high
efficiency by operating the vibrating mechanism, it is
desirable that an amplitude of each vibration is changed
to another one depending on the kind of material to be
compacted, a thickness of the compacted material and
other conditions.On the other hand, with respect to a conventional
apparatus for generating vibrations for a vibration
compacting roller with a variable amplitude (hereinafter
referred to simply as a conventional vibration generating
apparatus), many proposals have been hitherto made.
Typically, the conventional vibration generating
apparatus includes as essential components a vibration
generating shaft disposed in a vibration rolling drum of
the vibration compacting roller, a rotational driving
unit for rotationally driving the vibration generating
shaft in the normal/reverse direction, and a vibration
generating force
