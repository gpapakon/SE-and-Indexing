<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the use of
muscarinic antagonists for the manufacture of
pharmaceutical compositions, and primarily topically
applied ophthalmic compositions.
The pharmaceutical compositions are useful
for reducing intraocular pressure in animals of the
mammalian species. In another aspect, the present
invention is directed to the use of muscarinic antagonists for the manufacture
of formulations and compositions for administration to animals of the
mammalian species (including humans) for reducing
intraocular pressure in the eye.Glaucoma is an optical neuropathy associated with
elevated intraocular pressures which are too high for
normal function of the eye, and results in irreversible
loss of visual function. It is estimated in medical
science that glaucoma afflicts approximately 2 per cent
of the population over the age of fourty years, and is
therefore a serious health problem. Ocular
hypertension, i. e. the condition of elevated
intaocular pressure, which has not yet caused
irreversible damage, is believed to represent the
earliest phase of glaucoma. Many therapeutic agents
have been devised and discovered in the prior art for
the treatment or amelioration of glaucoma and of the
condition of increased intraocular pressure which
precedes glaucoma. As pertinent prior art to the
present invention the following are noted. United States Patent No. 3,467,756 describes anti-glaucoma
and intraocular hypotensive compositions which
contain in an ophthalmic vehicle 10,11-dihydro-5-(3-methylaminoipropyl)
-5,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene
or related derivatives.United States Patent No. 4,197,301 describes
ophthalmic compositions which contain 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(2-furanylcarbonyl)piperazine,
also known under the name
"prazosin".United States Patent No. 4,565,821 describes a
method of topically administering certain dopamine
antagonists to reduce ocular hypertension and to treat
glaucoma.United States Patent No. 4,886,815 describes a
method for treating retinal edema by administration of
dopaminergic antagonists to a patient suffering from
such condition.United States Patent No. 5,066,664 describes 2-hydroxy-2-alkylphenylamino)-oxazolines
and thiazolines
as anti-glaucoma and vasoconstrictive agents.United States Patent No. 5,091,528 describe 6 or
7-(2-imino-2-imidazolidine)-1,4-benzoxazines as α
adrenergic agents useful for treating glaucoma.The foregoing and other anti-glaucoma and ocular
hypotensive compounds and agents of the prior art do
