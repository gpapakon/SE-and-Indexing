<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to workstations in 
general and, in particular, to multi-media workstations in 
which full motion video images and computer generated 
information (graphic and non-graphic) are shown on displays. The proliferation of multi-media workstations create 
the need for new techniques and/or devices to process 
multi-media information. Generally, the multi-media workstation 
is capable of processing electrical signals representative 
of voice, data and video information. As a 
general proposition, the different types of information 
(i.e., data, voice or video) are propagated on a common 
transmission medium. A conventional workstation is comprised of a controller 
which is usually a personal computer (PC) and one 
or more Input/Output (I/O) devices. The I/O devices may 
include printers, displays, etc. Probably, the display 
unit is the most important of all the I/O devices. It 
gives a user a visual image of information inputted into 
the system and results based upon queries from the user. A 
conventional device, commonly known as a video adapter, 
couples the display device to the bus of the PC. An operating 
system such as OS/2R is executed on the PC and provides 
the necessary facilities (e.g., interfaces, protocols, 
format, etc.) for providing information on the display 
via the video adapter. The OS/2R product partitions 
the display screen into separate areas or windows in which 
selected information can be inserted and displayed to the 
user.  It is desirable for multi-media applications to 
display full motion video simultaneously with conventional 
computer graphic information in a windowing environment. 
Many primary sources of full motion video are in a format 
known as National Television Standards Committee (NTSC). 
An NTSC video image is composed of successive frames. Each 
frame consists of an interlaced odd and even field. Each 
field has 262.5 scan lines, 240 of which contain video 
information. Therefore, each frame has 480 interlaced 
lines of video information. To integrate the 480 lines of video information with 
computer graphics in a windowing environment, requires 
scaling the video image into a size which fits into a 
window of user defined height. In addition to scaling, the 
interlaced image has to be de-interlaced in order to be 
displayed in the window environment. One known scaling technique is decimination. In 
this technique, information is decimated (discarded) on a 
field basis, providing a maximum of 240 scaled window 
heights. When
