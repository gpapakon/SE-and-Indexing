<ABSTRACT>
A frame bracket for mounting a trailing arm to a trailer frame in a trailing arm suspension system comprising a U-shaped frame (118) having a front wall (124) and two side walls (126, 128), a combined stiffener and gusset (122) having a stiffening portion (164) extending between the U-shaped frame side walls (126, 128), and a gusset portion (169) extending outwardly from at least one of the U-shaped frame side walls (126, 128) and adapted to mount to the trailer frame to provide additional stiffening, and an attachment flange (150, 152, 154) curving inwardly from an upper edge of at least one of the front and side walls (124, 126, 128) of the U-shaped frame (118); whereby a weld may be placed between the attachment flange (150, 152, 154) and the trailer frame which is substantially in line with the at least one front or side wall (124, 126, 128) having the attachment flange (150, 152, 154).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SUSPENSION FRAME BRACKETBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe invention relates to vehicle suspensions and, more particularly, to mounting brackets for mounting a trailing arm in a trailing arm suspension system to a vehicle frame.State of the Prior ArtA typical suspension system for a heavy duty vehicle, such as a semitrailer, comprises a mounting bracket mounted to the underside of the vehicle frame, a trailing arm pivotably mounted to the bracket and extending rearwardly, an air spring mounted between the rear end of the trailing arm and the frame, and an axle mounted to the trailing arm intermediate the air spring and the bracket.A typical prior art mounting bracket and its attachment to a vehicle frame are shown in FIGS. 1 through 3. The bracket 10 comprises a U- shaped side frame 12, a U-shaped top plate insert 14, and front and rear gussets 16 and 18. When the bracket 10 is mounted to a vehicle frame, it depends therefrom such that the side walls 13a, 13b of the side frame 12 are oriented vertically and its open end 15 faces rearwardly. A portion of the rear edges 20 of the side frame 12 slopes forwardly and has outwardly extending flanges 21 to provide added stiffness to the sidewalls 13a, 13b of the side frame 12. The top plate insert 14 fits within the side frame 12 to further stiffen the bracket 10. The top plate insert 14 comprises a top panel 22 which fits tightly within the U-shaped frame 12 at its upper edges, a vertical panel 24 extending downwardly from the top panel 22, thereby enclosing a portion of the open rear of the side frame 12, and an angled panel 26, sloping forwardly within the side frame 12. The edges of the top plate insert 14 are typically welded to the surfaces of the side frame 12. The front and rear gussets 16 and 18 extend outwardly from the U-shaped frame 12 at its front and rear, respectively, and angle upwardly to be rigidly secured to the vehicle frame and thereby brace the bracket 10. Holes 28 in both sides of the side frame 12 near its lower edge are adapted to receive a pin for rotatably mounting the 

trailing arm. The upper edges of the side frame 12 and the front and rear gussets 16 and 18 are further secured to the vehicle frame by welding.Turning now more particularly to FIG. 2, the top panel 22 of the top plate insert 15 is frequently elevated above the upper edges of the side frame 12. A fillet weldment 30 permanently affixes an edge of the top panel 22 to a corresponding edge of the side frame 12. The weldment.30 is often uneven and must

CLAIMS
The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are as follows:
1. A mounting bracket assembly for mounting a trailing arm to a vehicle frame in a trailing arm suspension system, the mounting bracket assembly comprising: a side frame having a front plate and two side plates extending substantially parallel to each other from the front plate; a front gusset, adapted to be securely fixed to the front plate and adapted to be secured to a vehicle frame; and a one-piece rear gusset having a brace portion and a stiffening portion, the stiffening portion extending obliquely from the brace portion and sized to fit in the space between the side plates and to be welded thereto, and the brace portion having a portion wider than the stiffening portion thereby to extend outwardly of at least one of the side plates, said brace wider portion having a side edge secured to said at least one side plate and a top edge adapted to be secured to the vehicle frame wherein said brace wider portion extends laterally outwardly of said at least one side plate and between said at least one side plate and said vehicle frame when the mounting bracket is assembled to the vehicle frame.
2. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 1 wherein at least one of the front and side plates of the side frame has an attachment flange comprising a curved portion extending from an upper edge thereof, said attachment flange adapted to abut a vehicle frame with a gap between the curved portion and the vehicle frame, whereby to receive a weldment in the gap.
3. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the side plates has a lower edge substantially parallel to the upper edge, the lower edge being shorter than the upper edge. 


 4. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 3 wherein each side plate has a lower edge substantially parallel to the respective upper edge, each lower edge further being shorter than the respective upper edge, and one of the side plates has a stiffening flange extending therefrom between the upper and lower edges.
5. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 3 wherein the at least one side plate has a rear edge between the lower edge and the upper edge extending at a first angle relative to the lower edge, and the stiffening portion extends obliquely from the brace portion at a second angle more acute than the first angle.
6. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 2 wherein each side plate has a lower edge substantially parallel to the respective upper 
â€¢
edge, each lower edge further being shorter than the respective upper edge, and one of the side plates has a stiffening flange extending therefrom between the upper and lower edges.
7. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 1 wherein at least one of the side plates has a lower edge substantially parallel to the upper edge, the lower edge being shorter than the upper edge.
8. A mounting bracket assembly according to claim 1 wherein each side plate has a lower edge substantially parallel to the respective upper edge, each lower edge further being shorter than the respective upper edge, and one of the side plates has a stiffening flange extending therefrom between the upper and lower edges.
9. In a vehicle frame having a mounting bracket for mounting a trailing arm suspension, said mounting bracket comprising a front plate and two substantially parallel side plates, each of said front and side plates having upper edges welded to the vehicle frame, and bracing means to brace the mounting bracket against lateral stresses, the improvement comprising: 


 at least one upper edge being curved inwardly to form an attachment flange having a curved portion wherein a gap is provided between the curved portion and the vehicle frame, and the curved portion being secured to the vehicle frame by a weldment in the gap.
10. A vehicle frame according to claim 9 wherein the bracing means comprises a rear gusset having a stiffener portion and a brace portion, said stiffener portion extending obliquely from the brace portion and between the side plates, and welded thereto, said brace portion extending away from one of the side plates and having a portion thereof welded to the vehicle frame.
11. A vehicle frame according to claim 10 wherein each of the side plates has a lower edge shorter than the respective upper edge, and a rear edge extending at an angle from the lower edge so that the lower edges lie in a single plane, and wherein the brace portion is substantially parallel to the plane.
