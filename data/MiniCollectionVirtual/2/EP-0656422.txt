<ABSTRACT>
A method of assaying for CAT in a fluid 
involves the use of a complex of chloramphenicol with a 

member of a specific binding pair such as a hapten or 
biotin. Biotinylated chloramphenicol is claimed as 

new. A scintillation proximity assay involves use of 
this reagent with tritiated acetyl coenzyme A and 

streptavidin coated SPA beads.

<DESCRIPTION>
Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) is
the most commonly used reporter gene in molecular
biology. The enzyme catalyses the reaction of
chloramphenicol and acetyl coenzyme A to produce
acetylated chloramphenicol. The enzyme has no
eukaryotic counterpart and therefore is a useful
measure of transfection efficiency and translational
activity in cultured cells. Typically the gene,
contained on a plasmid, is transfected into the cell of
interest and, after an appropriate incubation period,
CAT activity is measured.CAT has a number of advantages for use as a
reporter gene:
The enzyme activity is readily
distinguishable from that of endogenous cellular
proteins present in the cell prior to transfection.There is no interference or competition
from other enzymatic activities in the cells.CAT is a relatively stable enzyme
exhibiting a degree of thermotolerance and a lack of
inhibition by cellular components.This is the most common method of assaying
for CAT activity. The cell extract containing CAT is
incubated with 14C chloramphenicol and cold acetyl coA.
After incubation the reactants are extracted into an
organic solvent and dried down. The reactants are
resuspended in a small volume and spotted on Thin Layer 
Chromatography (TLC) plates which are developed to
separate chloramphenicol from its acetylated
derivatives. The plates are then exposed to
autoradiographic film to locate the radioactive spots.
These can then be scraped off, extracted and
scintillation counted to give a measure of acetylation
activity. Alternatively if a radioactive imaging
system, such as a phosphorimager, is available the
plates can be exposed and directly quantified by
this means.The disadvantages of this method are as
follows:
The assay is cumbersome and time
consuming.The assay involves TLC.Organic solvents are used.Quantification is difficult.Sensitivity is limited.It is difficult to assay large numbers of
samples.A variation on the above assay uses a
radioactive acetyl group on the coA and cold
chloramphenicol. After the reaction the mix is
extracted with organic solvent or overlayed with water
immiscible scintillation fluid. Acetylated forms of
chloramphenicol diffuse into the organic phase and can
be counted.The assay is difficult to perform and
often yields unsatisfactory results due to phase
flipping problems.A chloramphenicol with a fluorescent molecule 
attached is commercially available. This assay format
is carried out by adding this fluorescent
chloramphenicol and acetyl coA to the cell extract.
