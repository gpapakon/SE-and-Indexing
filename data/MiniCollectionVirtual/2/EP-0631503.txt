<ABSTRACT>
A method of inducing a temporary substantial paralysis of an area of interest in a patient undergoing a medical procedure is provided. The method involves administering a therapeutically effective amount of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to a patient undergoing an endoscopy or other medical procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
inducing temporary paralysis of the gastrointestinal
tract by administering vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP) to a patient during the course of an endoscopy or
other medical procedure.Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a diagnostic
and therapeutic procedure which involves visual
examination of different portions of the
gastrointestinal tract using a long flexible tube known
as an endoscope. An endoscope has a lens on one end
and an eyepiece or video display system at the opposite
end. Endoscopy is performed in moderately sedated
patients by inserting the endoscope through the mouth
or rectum and positioning the lens in the desired area
of observation. Because the gastrointestinal tract is
actively contracting during the procedure, the
attending physician's visualization of certain regions
of the GI tract is impaired or limited. In addition,
this natural peristaltic reflex renders difficult the
biopsy of certain areas of the GI tract and often
interferes with the removal of polyps. In the case of
attempted polyp removal, the procedure is made more
difficult since the colon may be contracting when the
polyps are being snared, cauterized and removed. The
esophagus also moves at inopportune times such as when
dilated veins known as varices are being injected.Attempts to reduce gastrointestinal
contractions in endoscopic procedures have involved the 
use of several different agents over the years. In
particular, atropine and glucagon have been employed as
premedications for this purpose.Atropine is a belladonna alkaloid with
competitive antimuscarinic actions. In the
gastrointestinal tract it is an inhibitor of oral
secretion and gastrointestinal motility. However, it is
known by practitioners in the field to be only
marginally effective as a paralytic agent for use in
endoscopic procedures. In fact, controlled studies
have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of
atropine during endoscopies with regard to improvement
in patient tolerance or facilitation of endoscopy
(Ross, W.; Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Vol.35, No 2,
120-126, 1989). Atropine is also associated with
undesirable side effects such as blurred vision,
headache, and urinary retention (Goodman and Gilman,
The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 5th Ed.,
MacMillan, New York, 1975 pp. 514-532) and an increased
risk of cardiac arrhymthias (Ross, W., Gastrointestinal
Endoscopy, Vol.35, No. 2, 120-126, 1989).
Consequently, atropine is rarely used as a
premedication in endoscopy today.Glucagon has
