<ABSTRACT>
To decontaminate radioactively contaminated metal objects, these were introduced into a first bath comprising a radioactively uncontaminated aqueous solution of formic acid. The metal objects were left in the bath for several hours until the formic acid was stoichiometrically completely consumed. Thereupon the metal objects were introduced into a second bath of the same chemical composition. This too was stoichiometrically completely consumed. The concentration of the aqueous formic acid solution was about 0.3 mol/l. These steps were repeated until the residual contamination of the metal objects was below the outdoor limit of 0.37 Bq/cm

. The radioactively contaminated metal oxides were sedimented out and the sludge was consolidated with cement and thereafter disposed of.

Process for decontaminating radioactive metal surfaces by means of an 
aqueous solution containing methanoic acid, characterised in that the 

radioactively contaminated metal objects are placed into a first bath containing a 
non-radioactive 0.05-5.0 vol. % aqueous solution containing methanoic acid, in 

which the metal objects remain until the methanoic acid has been almost entirely 
used up stoichiometrically, after which the metal objects are placed into a 

second identical bath which in turn is almost entirely used up stoichiometrically, 
this stage is repeated until the metal objects have a level of radioactivity below 

the permitted limit, and the radioactive metal oxides and metal hydroxides are 
sedimented out of the stoichiometrically used aqueous solution and are 

solidified in a known manner, after which the non-radioactive aqueous solution 
can be used for a further decontamination bath after the addition of methanoic 

acid. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the aqueous solution used 
for further decontamination is purified completely to deionised water by means 

of an ion-exchange resin. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the aqueous solution in the 
final bath is subjected to electrolysis. 
Process according to claim 1, in which the radioactively contaminated metal 
objects are made of lead or nickel or contain lead or nickel, characterised in that 

an oxidant, in particular hydrogen peroxide, is added to the aqueous solution 
containing methanoic acid. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the baths are kept at a 
temperature between room temperature and 80Â°C.  

 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the concentration of 
methanoic acid in the aqueous solution is 0.1 to 1.0 Mol/l and the speed of 

erosion is controlled by the temperature of the bath. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that an oxidant is added to the 
solution, that has been almost completely used up stoichiometrically, containing 

the metals dissolved therein and radioactive nuclides and the water-insoluble 
sludge is removed. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that once the operation is 
completed, after the final almost complete use stoichiometrically of the aqueous 

solution with the metals dissolved therein and the radioactive nuclides, first an 
oxidant and then a lye is added, after which the precipitated sludge is separated 

either by filtration and/or decantation and/or sedimentation and is solidified for 
disposal, whilst the remaining aqueous solution is emptied into the sewage 

system. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that preferably H
2
O
2
 is used as 
the oxidant. 
Process according to claim 8, characterised in that H
2
O
2
 is used as the oxidant 
and NaOH and/or Ca(OH)
2
 is used as the lye. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that with the addition of 
methanoic acid the regenerated aqueous solution is returned to its original 

concentration and the next bath is started. 
Process according to claim 11, characterised in that all the stages of 
decontamination are performed in the same bath.
