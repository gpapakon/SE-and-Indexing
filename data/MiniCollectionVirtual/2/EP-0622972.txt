<ABSTRACT>
The inductive heating system uses two or more successive axial heating zones with separate supply of the heating power, which is regulated for at least one of the heating zones in dependence on the measured temp. of the mantle surfaces. At least two heating zones are combined to form a heating group for which the temp. is measured for regulation of the power for the selected heating zone. The heating power for the remaining heating zones in the same heating group are regulated in dependence on the heating power for the regulated heating zone.
