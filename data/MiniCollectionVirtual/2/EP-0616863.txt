<ABSTRACT>
In the direction of the toothing, the cold-formed rack-type workpiece (2) has a plurality of cold-forming tracks. In the manufacturing process, the workpiece (2) is moved transversely to the axis (12) of the rolling head in the device, relative to the rotatingly driven rolling head (12). Rollers (111) with annular ribs (113) are rotatably mounted on the rolling head (11) along at least one helical line (112) and these rollers (111) revolve in a planetary manner with the rolling head (11). In this arrangement, individual rolling operations overlapping in the feed direction (170) are performed in rapid succession with each roller (111). In this process, the annular ribs (113), which are shaped in the manner of toothed gaps, engage on the workpiece (2). In a process involving cold forming of the workpiece (2), workpiece material is here displaced by the annular ribs (113) predominantly from the toothed root to the toothed tip. It is also possible for the rollers to roll over the toothed tip. A device for carrying out the method has a holding device (15) for gripping the workpiece (2) and a rolling head (11) which can be driven in rotation about its axis (12), and furthermore has feed means (17) and a stroke-adjusting means (18). A plurality of rollers (111), each having at least one annular rib (113) in the form of toothed gaps, are arranged in a planetary manner along at least one helical line (112) and rotatably mounted on the rolling head (11).

Method for manufacturing a toothed rack 
(2,202,204,206) out of a workpiece (2,201,203,205), 

which is relatively moved in relation to a rolling head 
(11) rotatably driven around his rolling axis (12), 

said rolling head (11) having a plurality of rollers 
(111) revolving in a planetary manner and rotatably 

journalled along a helical line (112), each of said 
rollers (111) having at least one tooth space-shaped 

forming ring rib (113), in such a manner that each 
roller (111) is perform
ing in the moving direction in 
quick and overlapping succession single rolling 

processes, thereby displacing workpiece material 
predominantly from the bottom land area of the toothing 

to the top land area of the toothing by cold forming 
the workpiece (2,201,203,205) by means of the forming 

ring rib (113), characterised in that a relative 
movement is performed between the workpiece 

(2,201,202,203,204,205, 206) and the roller head (11) 
in a substantially perpendicular feeding direction 

(170) with respect to the roller axis (12). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
each roller (111) engages only the portion of the  

 
toothing (20) being formed by itself on said workpiece 

(2,201,202,203,204,205,206). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
multi-ribbed rollers (111), journalled in the rolling 

head (11) in a partially overlapping manner (Fig. 6) in 
the axial direction, engage partially overlapping 

portions of the toothings (20) of the workpiece 
(2,201,202,203,204,205,206). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that also the top land area of the 

toothing is treated by a rolling process. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method of one of 
the claims 1 to 4, comprising a frame (10), a holding 

device (15) for clamping the workpiece (2,201,203,205), 
a rolling head (11) rotatably drivable around ist 

working head axis (12), feeding means (17) for 
performing a feeding movement between the holding 

device (15) and the rolling head (11) and adjustment 
means (18) for controlling the feed of the workpiece 

(2,202,204,206) towards the rolling head (11), said 
rolling head (11) including a plurality of rollers 

(11), each roller having at least one tooth space-shaped 
forming ring rib (113) and being rotatably  

 
journalled positioned along a helical line (112) in a 

planetary type manner, in order to engage said 
workpiece (2,201,202,203,204,205,206), characterised in 

that the feeding means (17) are designed such as to 
perform a feeding movement (170) substantially 

perpendicular with respect to the rolling head axis 
(12). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the rollers (111) are arranged on the rolling head 

(11) along a plurality of helical lines. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that each roller (111) is arranged adjacent to the 

next roller in the rolling head (11) free of 
overlapping profiles in the axial direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the rollers (111) of the rolling head (11) are 

multi-ribbed rollers (111) and, in the axial direction, 
are partially overlapping each other in profile (Fig. 

6).
