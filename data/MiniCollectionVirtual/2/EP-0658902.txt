<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory device and, more particularly, to an improvement
in a data read/write circuit in a so-called synchronous
dynamic random access memory (synchronous DRAM).Recently, with a tendency to increase the operation
speed of a microprocessor unit (MPU), the demand for
making increase of the operation speed of a semiconductor
memory device is rising. To this end, various high-speed
memories are proposed. One of among them, there is a
synchronous DRAM. This DRAM operates in synchronism
with an external clock and employs a pipeline structure
to perform a high speed data read/write operation. Such
a synchronous DRAM is constituted as shown in FIG. 5.
Note that only a data read/write circuit portion is shown
and a memory cell array as well as peripheral circuits for
selecting memory cell(s) are omitted in Fig. 5.A command control circuit 10 receives external input
signals RAS, CAS and WE as well as an external clock
signal CLK and produces a write activation signal WR and 
a read activation signal RE. An internal clock generation
circuit 20 receives the external clock signal CLK and
generates internal clock signals ICLK1, ICLK2 and ICLK3.A write/read control circuit 30 receives the write
activation signal WR, the read activation signal RE and
the internal clock signal ICLK2 and outputs a writing
pulse signal WPAL1 and a reading pulse signal RPAL. A
write data buffer 40 comprises a D-F/F circuit which
receives an external input data from a data terminal DQ
and the internal clock signal ICLK1 and outputs a write
data WDATA1. A write data latching circuit 50 also
comprises a D-F/F circuit which latches the write data
WDATA1 in synchronism with the internal clock signal ICLK2
and outputs it as a write data WDATA2.A read/write bus driving circuit 62 receives the
write data WDATA2 and the writing pulse signal WPAL1 and
drives true and complementary read/write buses RWBUST and
RWBUSN. A write switching circuit 70 receives data from
the read/write buses RWBUST and RWBUSN and drives true
and complementary write buses WBUST and WBUSN while
outputting a write switching signal WSW. When either
of data sent from the read/write buses RWBUST and RWBUSN
is at the low level (hereafter referred to as L), the
write switching circuit 70 sets the write switching signal
WSW to a high level (hereafter referred to as H) and
outputs write-data onto the write buses WBUST and WBUSN. 
On the other hand, when the both potentials of the read/write
buses RWBUST and RWBUSN are H, the write
