<ABSTRACT>
Charge pump circuit operating in cyclic mode, including two current sources (11, 21), (12, 22) in parallel, as well as a current mirror (M1) for converting the current delivered by one of the sources and absorbing it at the output of the other source. Circuit characterised in that with each of the current sources consisting essentially of a transistor (11), (12), this transistor is controlled from the output (VB) of a reference-voltage generator (14), through a transistor switch, respectively (15), (16). The reference- voltage generator (14) consists essentially of a third transistor (13), similar to the first two transistors (11), (12), in series with a current source (So) delivering a current Io, as well as means (20) for setting the current passing through the third transistor (13) equal to the current Io. Application to frequency synthesisers.

comprises a first current source (11, 21) and a second current source (12, 22) of similar 

construction, whose current supplied to a second supply terminal (Vss) is nominally 
identical, said sources being activated independently and cyclically by control signals,
