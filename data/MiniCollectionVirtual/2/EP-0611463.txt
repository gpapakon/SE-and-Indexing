<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computer
aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and
more particularly to a novel machine tool fixture computer
aided setup (CAS) method for automating the design of the
fixture and its set up on the machine tool table.It has become common to produce an article of
manufacture through a process or system which is typically
referred to as computer aided design and computer aided
manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Through the use of computer
systems programmed with CAD/CAM software, the time
necessary to engineer, prototype and manufacture an article of
manufacture has been substantially reduced.The CAD software allows the designer to visualize a
dimensionally scaled image of the article to be manufactured
on a video display terminal of the computer which contains the
CAD software. Through use of the CAD software, the designer
can then engineer the article by acting only on the displayed
video image of the article. With each iteration in the design
sequence, the CAD software will calculate useful information
regarding the article and graphically display such information.
This information may include, inter alia, geometries of the
article, such as size, shape, dimensions and points of
intersection, and relevant textual information concerning the
article. The information is generally displayable in 
conjunction with the video representation.By reviewing the video image of the article and any
displayed information, the designer can, over one or more
iterations, interactively modify the video image and review
the modifications in conjunction with the updated information.
The final iteration results in an enhanced and perfected design
of the article. The CAD software can then develop digital data
which defines or describes the final design and from which the
article can be manufactured. The data may be stored in any
appropriate medium.The data is interpreted by the CAM software and a
machine tool operator to program a machine tool numerical
controller with a set of (x,y,z) data points and the action to
occur between each data point, such as the cutting tool path
and the tool selection for example, to develop a machining
sequence. The (x,y,z) data is usually referenced from a frame
of reference origin within a machine table fixture which holds
the machinable stock from which the article is fabricated
during the machining sequence.The fixture in turn is mounted to the machine tool table
which has its own frame of reference origin. In the prior art,
considerable time
