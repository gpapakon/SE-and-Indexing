<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a tread part (T) having 
two circumferential grooves (7) continuously 

extending in the circumferential direction on either 
side of the tyre's equator (CL) so as to divide the 

tread part (T) into a pair of shoulder parts (8), 
which are located outside outer bottom edges (7b) of 

the circumferential grooves (7) in the axial 
direction of tyre, and a central part (9), which is 

located between inner bottom edges (7a) of the 
circumferential grooves (7) in the axial direction 

of tyre, characterised in that the central part (9) 
has a surface comprising successive convex curves 

composed of a pair of inner groove walls (9A) 
extending inwards, in the axial direction of tyre, 

along a curve convex outwardly in the radial 
direction from the inner bottom edges (7a) of the 

circumferential grooves (7) and a central ground-contacting 
surface (9B) smoothly connected between 

the pair of the inner groove walls (9A), the central 
ground-contacting surface (9) is substantially in 

contact with a virtual tread line (10) between 
outer surfaces (12) of the shoulder parts, and when  

 
the tyre is mounted on a regular rim, inflated to 

its regular internal pressure and has applied its 
normal load, a ground-contacting area Fc where t
he 
central part (9) contacts the ground has a length Lc 

in the tyre's circumferential direction which is 0.9 
to 1.1 times a length Ls in the tyre's 

circumferential direction of a ground-contacting 
area FS where the shoulder part contacts the ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre, 
particularly a low aspect radial tyre for passenger 
vehicles, capable of providing higher wet grip 
performance and reduction of tyre noise and 
maintaining steering stability. Recently, as automobiles become quieter tyre noise 
has come to contribute a higher ratio of the total 
noise level of an automobile, and its reduction is 
demanded. Such noise reduction is specifically 
desired in a range around 1 kHz from the peak 
frequency of tyre noise, and sounds due to a 
columnar resonance generated by circumferential 
grooves is one of the main sound sources in such a 
frequency range. On the other hand, in order to maintain the wet grip 
performance, the tread of a tyre is generally 
provided with plural circumferential grooves 
continuously extending in the circumferential 
direction of tyre. In such a tyre, when it is in contact with the 
ground, a kind of air column is formed by the road  
 
surface and the circumferential groove. Then a 
sound of a specific wavelength, which is double the 
wave length of the air column is caused by airflow 
within the column during running. Such a phenomenon is referred to as the columnar 
resonance, and provides the main source of noise at 
800 Hz to 1.2 kHz. The wavelength of the columnar 
resonance sound is approximately constant to give a 
constant frequency regardless of the tyre's speed, 
and this increases sound inside and outside an 
automobile. Incidentally, since this noise around 1 
kHz is a sound easily heard by a human ear, the 
increase of noise with such a frequency range 
influences the tyre noise performance greatly. In order to prevent the columnar resonance, although 
reduction of the number or volume of the 
circumferential grooves is known, such reductions 
lead to a lower wet grip performance. On the other hand, although the wet grip performance 
can be increased contrarily by increasing the number 
or volume of circumferential grooves, a simple 
increase causes reduction of the dry grip 
performance, because the ground-contact area is  
 
reduced. Also, this causes a reduction of steering 
stability as the rigidity of the tread pattern is 
reduced, in addition to the increase in tyre noise. 
Conventionally, a tyre's performance has been 
adjusted by sacrificing one or more performances 
factors. EP-A-0 593 288, document falling under Art. 54(3), shows a 
similar tyre in which the ratio Lc/Ls of central to shoulder 
lengths of the footprint is greater than 1. It is hence a primary object of
