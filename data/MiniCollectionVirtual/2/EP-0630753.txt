<ABSTRACT>
A wiper according to the invention comprises two 
or more wiper blades (60-64, 68, 69, 76, 77) arranged one 

behind the other in close proximity, where the two or more 
wiper blades are different from one another so as to have 

slightly different wiping swaths. The resulting wipers 
greatly increase the allowable alignment tolerance between 

the wiper and the nozzle member (16) of a printhead (14), 
especially if the printhead (14) is of the kind having 

raised adhesive beads (22, 23) dispensed near the ends of 
the nozzle member (16). In one embodiment, two different 

size wiper blades (68, 69, 76, 77), arranged one behind the 
other, have slits formed near the ends of the wiper blades. 

The slits mechanically decouple those end portions (70-73, 
80-82) of the wiper blades which ride over the adhesive 

beads (22, 23) from the remaining 20 portions of the wiper 
blades to keep the remaining portions of the blades in 

contact with the nozzle member (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to inkjet
printers and, in particular, to a method and structure for
wiping the printheads of one or more print cartridges.Inkjet printhead nozzles must occasionally be cleaned
to remove ink residue or particulates from the nozzles;
otherwise the nozzles would become clogged. Conventional
service mechanisms in prior art inkjet printers typically
provide wiping and capping of printheads to keep the
nozzles from becoming clogged. One type of inkjet printer providing wiping and capping of printheads
to keep the nozzles from becoming clogged is described in European Patent
Application 0 446 885 A1 entitled "Ink jet recording apparatus and
mechanism for discharging maintenance and recovery provided for the
apparatus". A cleaning member is provided with a first cleaning member
mainly used for cleaning a discharging port portion and a second cleaning
member mainly used for cleaning the circumference of the discharging port
portion. Fig. 1 illustrates one type of print cartridge 10
having a printhead which requires wiping after a printing
session to avoid ink clogging the nozzles. Inkjet print
cartridge 10 includes an ink reservoir 12 and a printhead
14, where printhead 14 includes a metal or plastic nozzle
plate 16 having formed in it two parallel columns of
offset nozzles 17. Nozzle plate 16 is affixed to the
surface of a semiconductor substrate (not shown) having
heater resistors and vaporization chambers formed on its
surface which are aligned with each of the nozzles 17
formed in nozzle plate 16.A flexible polymer tape 18 has conductive traces
formed thereon which terminate in contact pads 20 for
contacting corresponding electrodes on a printer when
print cartridge 10 is installed in the printer. The
conductive traces on tape 18 lead to a rectangular opening
in tape 18 in which the nozzle plate 16 is located. The
ends of the traces are bonded to exposed electrodes on the
rectangular substrate underlying nozzle plate 16. After
bonding the traces to the electrodes on the substrate, the
electrodes and traces are exposed through the rectangular
opening in tape 18 and must be protected from ink and
physical damage. To provide such protection, adhesive 
beads 22 and 23 are dispensed over the exposed traces to
encapsulate the traces. The adhesive may be epoxy or any
other suitable adhesive.In another embodiment of a print cartridge which may
benefit from the present invention, a nozzle member is
created by forming nozzles directly in tape 18 so no
separate nozzle plate
