<ABSTRACT>
Liquid waste material, particularly material containing sulphuric acid, may be combusted using an oxygen-rich material by a process in which: (i) a primary oxidant and fuel issuing from a burner are combusted in a furnace, the proportion of primary oxidant to fuel being such that there is insufficient oxygen to combust the fuel completely, (ii) introducing into the furnace the liquid waste material in atomised form around the burner, (iii) introducing into the furnace spaced from the burner a secondary oxidant which contains sufficient oxygen to combust completely the fuel not combusted by the primary oxidant the direction in which each of the primary oxidant, fuel and liquid waste material is introduced being such that the substances flow in substantially the same direction, the rate at which the primary oxidant, fuel, liquid waste material and secondary oxidant are introduced being such that a plug flow of substances through the furnace is created.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method and 
apparatus for treating liquid waste material by combustion. Such a method and apparatus are known from US-A-4 544 350. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a method for 
treating contaminated acid, especially contaminated sulphuric 
acid, by the application of heat to thermally and oxidatively 
dissociate the acid. The production of waste by-product materials is a common 
problem with many industrial processes. For example contaminated 
or spent acid is produced in the course of a number of industrial 
processes. Particular mention may be made of contaminated 
sulphuric acid which is produced in large quantities during the 
manufacture of methyl methacrylate by the so-called ACH process. The sulphuric acid which is generated during the production 
of methyl methacrylate by the ACH process is contaminated with 
water, ammonium sulphate, ammonium bisulphate and various organic 
species. The treatment of such waste sulphuric acid by combustion has 
been described in various patents, especially when the furnace is part 
of a sulphuric acid recovery facility. In one such sulphuric acid recovery facility, the 
contaminated sulphuric acid is introduced into a furnace along 
with fuel. The fuel/air mixture is combusted to generate the 
necessary heat to both vaporise the contaminated sulphuric acid 
and dissociate the acid and its associated contaminants to form 
water, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. These gaseous 
combustion products, together with the nitrogen contained in the 
air, exit the furnace and are passed firstly through a waste heat 
boiler to recover waste heat and then through a gas cleaning unit 
to remove water. Following water removal, the gas stream 
containing the sulphur dioxide is passed through a catalytic 
converter where the sulphur dioxide is reacted with oxygen to 
produce sulphur trioxide. The resulting product is then passed 
through an absorption tower in which the sulphur trioxide is 
reacted with water to produce sulphuric acid and/or oleum by the  
 
contact process. However, the use of air to support the combustion process 
carries with it certain problems. The inert gases (predominantly 
nitrogen) contained in air contribute significantly to the heat 
load, since they must also be heated to the appropriate 
temperature in the combustion process. In effect, a significant 
proportion of the heat generated in the combustion of the fuel is 
wasted by having to heat up the inerts contained in the air. In
