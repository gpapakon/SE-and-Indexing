<ABSTRACT>
A directional dispensing package (1) which is easily shipped, 
filled and 

assembled is disclosed. The package includes a retaining 
opening (11) into which a 

modular pump (12) is snap-fit by inserting the modular pump (12) through 
an open end of 

the package. The package also includes a upstanding wall portion (3), 
which provides 

a dispensing actuator locking and sealing mechanism, as well as a tamper-evident 
tab. The package (1) and pump (12) are assembled at a production site, 

and are 
thereafter shipped to a filling site with a bottom portion (17). 

The package (1) is filled 
through the open bottom end (16), and then the bottom portion (17) 

is sealingly affixed to 
the package (1). The package (1) may include an integrally-molded dip 

tube structure 
and a bottom portion with specific structure for allowing easy assembly while 

preventing leakage. Accordingly, the device of the present invention can be filled 
and finally assembled with a minimal number of steps, and is therefore 

particularly suited for quick-turnaround marketing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a complete dispensing package designed
to be shipped as an assembled unit to a liquid product marketer, for subsequent
filling. The dispensing package is easily filled and bottom sealed with a minimal
number of automatic assembly steps. A package embodying the present invention also
includes structure to provide an air seal to the dispensing nozzle and lock the
dispensing actuator when it is not in use, and provides a tamper-resistant package.
The dispensing package further includes a bottom sealing mechanism adapted for
easy assembly, effective sealing, and which allows stacking of the dispensing
package upon another dispensing package. The dispensing package may include
an integral dip tube, which allows for easy filling and assembly.U.S. Patent No. 5,158,211 discloses a dispensing package including a
modular pump which is assembled into a dispensing package using a snap fit, such 
that the dispensing pump is permanently retained in the
package. In the device disclosed in Patent No. 5,158,211,
the package is filled through an opening at the top of the
package. After filling, the pump is attached to the
package, either by snap-fitting the pump structure into a
retaining opening, or by adding the pump to the package
using a conventional screw-cap mounting. Accordingly, in
the device of Patent No. 5,158,211, the assembled pump
structure and the package must be shipped unassembled to a
filling and assembly site, where the package is filled and
the pump is then assembled to the package. The invention
of Patent No. 5,158,211 also includes a mechanism for
sealing the outlet nozzle when the dispenser is not in use,
and a mechanism for making the dispenser tamper-resistant,
to thereby prevent placing any foreign substances or
liquids into the package after it is sealed, and also to
prevent accidental discharge of liquid.U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/999,330, the
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference,
discloses two designs of a pump which is constructed
entirely of a plastic material, to make the pump easily
recyclable.EP-A-0 251 939 discloses a perfume spray dispenser
comprising an annular flask having a lower end formed with
a central aperture which is sealed by a stopper.FR-A-2,646,408 discloses a dispensing package
