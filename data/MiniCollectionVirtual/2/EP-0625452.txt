<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a windscreen wiper blade including a dorsal part (1, 11) and a wiper lip (2, 12) which are joined together by a hinge piece (8) allowing the wiper lip to deflect relative to a middle position. The blade consists of at least two sections (1, 2; 11, 12) joined together, at least one of the sections having a means (7'20) for the connection of one end of the hinge piece (8) made of a material whose hardness is lower than the material of the first section (1, 11).

A screen wiper strip comprising a dorsal portion 
(1, 11) and a wiping lip (2, 12) which are joined 

together by a hinge (8) which enables the wiping lip to 
be displaced with respect to a median position, the 

strip consisting of at least two profiled members (1, 
2; 11, 12) assembled together, characterised in that 

at least one of the profiled members has means (7', 20) 
for connection to an end of the hinge (8), and in that 

the hinge is made of a material having a hardness 
greater than that of the material of at least one 

profiled member (1, 2: 11, 12). 
A screen wiper strip according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the other profiled member has a 

means (7', 20) for connection to another end of the 
hinge (8). 
A screen wiper strip according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the hinge (8) is made in the form 

of a third profiled element (13) cooperating with the 
profiled elements (1, 2; 11, 12). 
A screen wiper strip according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the profiled 

members (1, 2; 11, 12; 13) are co-extruded.  
 
A screen wiper strip according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the connecting 

means consist of a groove (7', 20). 
A screen wiper strip according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the third profiled element (13) 

has an I-shaped form in cross section. 
A screen wiper strip according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the grooves 

(7', 20) have, in cross section, a form complementary 
to that of the end of the hinge (8) received therein. 
A screen wiper strip according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that one profiled 

element (1, 11) has a dorsal portion (4) having a pair 
of longitudinal grooves (5, 6) and extended by a hinge 

(7, 8) on its lower side. 
A screen wiper strip according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the profiled 

members are selected from the following: 

two grades of Santoprene, co-extruded; 
the first profiled element (1, 11) in hard Santoprene 
and the second profiled member (2, 13) in soft Vyram, 

co-extruded; 
the first profiled member in PA and the second 
profiled member in soft Peba, co-extruded;  

 
the first profiled member in hard EPDM and the second 
profiled member in soft EPDM, co-extruded and 

continuously co-vulcanised; 
the first profiled member in hard Peba and the second 
profiled member in soft PVC-nitryl, co-extruded and 

continuously co-vulcanised. 
A screen wiper blade, especially for motor 
vehicles, characterised in that it includes a screen 

wiping strip in accordance with one of the preceding 
Claims.
