<ABSTRACT>
The focusing characteristic of this electron gun is not impaired by the aberration caused by the deviation 
of the centers of the holes on both sides of the main lens, through which the electron beams are passed, and the 

astigmatism of the electron beams due to the uneven magnetic field such as of a deflecting yoke when the electron 
gun is in operation. In the focusing electrode (1) of the electron gun, a plurality of focusing grooves are formed in 

parallel with the direction in which the electron beams are passed. A plurality of additional electrode members, each 
consisting of a flat thin plate, are inserted into the focusing grooves, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electron gun assembly for a 
color image receiving tube. Specifically, the invention relates 
to an electron gun assembly which prevents a lowering of the 
focusing characteristic of a color image receiving tube from 
being disturbed by aberrations caused by deviation of the centers 
of electron beams through holes of a main lens and by the 
occurrence of uneven magnetic field phenomena upon electron 
beams, such as deflection yoke, during the operation of the 
electron gun assembly. Generally, a color image receiving tube comprises a panel 
11 on which a fluorescent film 12 is coated and a funnel 13 
attached to the back of the panel 11 as shown in Fig. 1. Inside 
the image receiving tube, an electron gun assembly 8 emitting 
thermion and a shadow mask 14 distinguishing colors are 
installed. A deflection yoke 15 is mounted on the outer surface 
of the funnel 13 in order to deflect the electron beams. The electron gun assembly 8 is comprised of a cathode 
electrode heated and operated by a heater, a controlling 
electrode, a screen electrode, a focus electrode, an anode 
electrode and a shield cup which are placed in series in front 
of the cathode electrode. Each electrode is placed apart from each other at regular  
 
intervals and supported by bead glass in the shape of a pole or 
a plate. Each electrode has three electron beam passage holes. Further, at least two electrostatic lenses are formed in the 
electron gun assembly; one is a pre-focus lens formed by the 
potential differences between the applied voltage of the screen 
electrode and the applied voltage of the focus electrode, and the 
other is a main lens formed by the potential differences between 
the applied voltage of the focus electrode and the applied 
voltage of the anode electrode. The pre-focus lens helps prevent 
the electron beam which emits toward the main lens from 
scattering, while the main lens converges the electron beam on 
the screen. If the central axis of the electron beam does not impact 
upon the center axis of the main lens, a halo phenomena results 
at the beam spots on the screen and the resolution of the color 
image receiving tube diminishes. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the focus electrode used in 
the prior art for a electron gun assembly. In the electrode body 
1, three electron beam through holes a, b and c are arranged 
parallel to each other at regular intervals. If both external 
electron beams converge on the screen under each of the electron 
beam through holes of the
