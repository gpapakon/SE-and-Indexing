<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to non-linear signal processing having a transfer
which is adjustably dependent on the amplitude of an input signal.In a digital circuit, such a non-linear signal processing can be realised in a
very simple manner by means of a memory operating as a look-up table. However, in
an analog circuit, a non-linear circuit having a transfer which is adjustably dependent on
the amplitude of an input signal cannot be realised in an obvious manner.EP-A-0 382 100 discloses a gamma correction device which comprises a
classifying circuit for dividing an input video signal into a plurality of level ranges
according to a plurality of signal levels, a computing circuit for computing the region of
the video signal within each of the level ranges obtained by the classifying circuit, and a
gamma correction control circuit which is arranged to have the gamma correction
characteristic thereof controlled, according to each region computed by the computing
circuit, to gamma-correct the input video signal and to output the gamma-corrected
video signal. This device shows the disadvantage that a period of time is required for
computing the region according to the level range of the video signal. Therefore, the
gamma-correction cannot be carried out in real time.DE-A-42 37 420 discloses an automatic image-tone control circuit and
method for controlling image brightness. An input-output characteristic having an
arbitrary line graph is obtained by plural gradient adjusting circuits in response to
frequencies of appearance of the brightness of the luminance which are detected by a
plural brightness frequency detection circuits. Each gradient adjusting circuit comprises
an adjusting current generation circuit, and an adding circuit for adding an adjusting
current from the corresponding adjusting current generation circuit to other adjusting
currents from adjusting current generation circuits of lower ranking gradient adjusting
circuit, which other adjusting currents are weighted by factors depending on the
difference in rank between the present gradient adjusting circuit and the respective
lower ranking gradient adjusting circuit. Each gradient adjusting circuit further 
comprises a gradient adjusting current generation circuit for multiplying all of the input
signal by a factor which depends on an output signal of the corresponding adding
circuit. This results in a rather complex circuit with a limited flexibility.It is, inter alia, an object of the invention to provide a simple and flexible
analog non-linear
