<ABSTRACT>
A flow diverter designed to be screwed into a housing 
(12') provided in the spout (12) of a bathtub tap 

assembly in order to control delivery of water through 
said spout or towards a shower connected thereto 

through a flexible pipe. It comprises a body (10) 
including two coaxial complementary elements (14, 15) 

superimposed and snapped together, enclosing a stopper 
(11) and constituting a cartridge-shaped assembly 

designed to be applied enbloc into the housing (12') 
provided in the said spout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to taps and more 
particularly it relates to a flow diverter designed to 
be applied to bathtub tap assemblies in order to 
control selective delivery of water through a tap 
battery spout or through a shower connected thereto. At present, flow diverters for bathtub tap 
assemblies are known which comprise a body including a 
stopper which is axially movable as a piston and which 
interacts alternatively with two seats located at 
different levels in order to permit delivery of water 
either to the tap assembly spout or to a shower 
connected to the diverter.  Traditional diverters comprise a body constituted 
by several elements, generally or prevalently made in 
metal, which are applied to the bathtub tap assembly 
severally, in succession, with laborious operations and 
which are thus assembled when mounting the diverter in 
place. Moreover, such diverters are always of 
considerable dimensions, owing to the type of assembly 
required among the elements of the diverter body, and 
also produce reduced flow rates in respect to their 
dimensions owing to the presence of improper 
throttlings inside said body. The aim of the present invention is to obviate 
said disadvantageous characteristics of known diverters 
by providing a new, original diverter intended for 
application to a bathtub tap assembly enbloc and with 
only one operation, and which has a particularly simple 
and compact structure though ensuring considerable flow 
rates with the diverter in both positions. In fact, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a flow diverter for bathtub tap assemblies 
pre-assembled in cartridge form, which may be mounted 
in place as such, i.e. as a whole, and which does not 
require handling or assembly of any separate elements. Another object of the invention is to provide a  
 
diverter having a cartridge-shaped structure whose 
largest part does not exceed 30 mm in diameter 
preferably less than 26 mm, and in which the passages 
for water delivery towards the spout and towards the 
shower have equal openings, and therefore equal flow 
rates. A further object of the invention is to provide 
an automatic flow diverter which is also integrated 
with manual opening, thus permitting the diverter to be 
kept permanently open in shower position even when no 
water is running, i.e. when the tap assembly is closed. Said objects and some others not mentioned herein 
are achieved by a diverter for bathtub tap assemblies 
substantially according to claim 1. Further details

<CLAIMS>
A flow diverter designed to be screwed in place in a 
housing (12') provided in the spout (12) of a bathtub 

tap assembly in order to control delivery of water 
through said spout or towards a shower connected 

thereto by means of a flexible pipe, comprising a body 
(10) and a piston stopper (11) stressed by a spring 

(23) and displaceable in said body between a first 
stopper seat (14a) in order to stop water flow towards 

the shower while keeping water flow towards the spout, 
and a second stopper seat (15c) in order to stop water 

flow towards the spout while keeping water flow towards 
the shower, characterized in that said body (10) 

comprises two coaxial complementary elements (14,15), 
superimposed and snapped together, which enclose said 

stopper (11) and constitute a cartridge-shaped assembly 
which may be mounted enbloc into the housing (12') of 

such spout. 
A flow diverter as claimed in claim 1, wherein a 
first element (14) of said body defines, outside, a 

first threaded portion (14') to permit screwing into 
the said housing (12') and a second threaded portion 

(14'') designed to permit connection of a flexible pipe 
(13) of a shower, and, inside, in axial order, a first 

range of radial passages (14e), the first stopper seat 
(14a), an intermediate grill plane (14b) and an axial 

 
hole (14c) for the outflow of water towards said 

flexible pipe, and wherein the second element (15) of 
said body defines a second range of radial passages 

(15b), the second stopper seat (15c) located 
intermediately between the said first and second range 

of radial passages (14a and 15b) and a slideway hole 
for the stopper (11), the first and the second element 

(14, 15) of such body being snapped together in 
proximity to said first range of radial passages. 
A flow diverter as claimed in claim 2, wherein said 
first threaded portion (14') is 18 to 30 mm in diameter 

preferably 21 to 26 mm, 
A flow diverter as claimed in claim 2, wherein said 
axial hole (14c) for the outflow of water towards said 

shower flexible pipe is hexagonal or however polygonal 
in order to receive a spanner for permitting screwing 

and tightening in place of the diverter. 
A diverter as claimed in the previous claims, 
wherein the stopper (11) comprises a stem (16) provided 

a biconical gasket (17) acting alternatively on said 
first and second stopper seats, such stem (16) being 

also provided with at least one side projection (24) 
which interacts with said intermediate grill plane 

(14b), after displacement of the stopper towards the 
second stopper seat and rotation thereof, in order to 

 
keep said stopper in open position of water flow 

towards the shower. 
A diverter as claimed in the previous claims, 
wherein said second element (15) of the body (10) is 

provided with a neck (15'') covered with a finishing 
tubular element which may be chromium plated or 

coloured.
