<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing novel coated nickel and/or 
cobalt superalloy bodies having increased 

resistance to oxidation, corrosion and thermal 
fatigue at high temperatures. The process 

comprises applying a thin layer of a platinum-group 
metal, siliciding and heating to an elevated 

temperature to diffuse and integrate the silicided 
platinum-group metal into the surface of the 

superalloy body. Then the superalloy body is 
exposed to a diffusion powder composition 

containing sources of aluminum or aluminum/chromium 
metals and heated in a hydrogen or inert gas 

atmosphere to an elevated temperature to codeposit 
and diffuse aluminum or aluminum and chromium into 

the silicided platinum-group metal-treated surface. 
Finally, the superalloy body is heated to its 

solvus temperature to form a ductile surface having 
an outer zone comprising a platinum-group metal 

aluminide, optionally ductilized by the solutioning 
therein of beta chromium. An inner stabilizing 

zone of silicon-rich phases is formed during said 
diffusion processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the coating of
high temperature superalloys, such as high nickel- and
high cobalt-superalloys to provide them with an
improved protective outer layer which has increased
and stabilized resistance to oxidation and
corrosion when subjected to such atmospheres at
high temperatures by virtue of increased ductility
and stabilization of the Beta NiAl and Beta CoAl
phases. An important use of such superalloys is
for turbine blades in jet aircraft or power
generation engines which perform at high
temperatures and in corrosive and oxidizing
atmospheres.It is known to form protective coatings on the
surface of metal superalloy components, such as
turbine blades, using metals to form layers which
are more resistant to corrosion and/or oxidation at
high temperatures than is the base superalloy.According to one such procedure, disclosed in U.S.
Patent 3,677,789 by Bungardt et al., the base
superalloy is first coated with a thin layer of 
noble metal, such as platinum, and is them
subjected to a high temperature aluminum diffusion
treatment for several hours to form a protective
layer diffused into and integrated with the base
superalloy. The formed protective surface layer
comprises platinum aluminide which has the
disadvantages of being brittle, subject to craze
cracking and has low impact strength.Diffusion coating compositions and procedures for
diffusing both aluminum and chromium into
superalloy base metal components in a single step
are known from U.S. Patent 4,293,338 by Rose et al.
Thus, the prepared superalloy base component is
packed into a conventional diffusion-coating
container together with a powdered cementation pack
coating composition containing intermetallic CO2Al9
powder and chromium metal powder, heated to about
1052°-1080°C (1925°-1975°F) for about three-four hours in a
hydrogen gas atmosphere, removed and post-treated
in a hydrogen, inert gas or vacuum atmosphere for
about two hours at about 1066°-1080°C (1950°-1975°F). A
codeposited diffusion layer of aluminum and
chromium is thereby provided at the superalloy
metal surface, but in the absence of any platinum
group metal.EP-0 491 414 A1 discloses a method of forming platinum-silicon-enriched
diffused aluminide coatings on a superalloy substrate, which
method comprises (a) electrophoretically depositing onto the substrate
body a platinum-silicon powder, (b) heating the deposited platinum-silicon
powder at a temperature sufficient to melt the powder into a
transient liquid phase and to initiate diffusion of
