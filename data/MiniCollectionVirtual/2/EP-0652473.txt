<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photothermographic
element having an antihalation layer.Light sensitive recording materials may suffer
from a phenomenon known as halation which causes
degradation in the quality of the recorded image. Such
degradation may occur when a fraction of the imaging
light which strikes the photosensitive layer is not
absorbed but passes through to the film base on which
the photosensitive layer is coated. A portion of the
light reaching the base may be reflected back to strike
the photosensitive layer from the underside. Light
thus reflected may, in some cases, contribute
significantly to the total exposure of the
photosensitive layer. Any particulate matter in the
photosensitive element, including silver salts, may
cause light passing through the element to be
scattered. Scattered light which is reflected from the
film base will, on its second passage through the
photosensitive layers cause exposure over an area
adjacent to the point of intended exposure. It is this
adjacent exposure effect which leads to image
degradation. Silver halide based photographic
materials (including photothermographic materials) are
particularly prone to this form of image degradation
since the photosensitive layers contain light
scattering particles. The effect of light scatter on
image quality is well documented and is described, for 
example, in T.H. James "The Theory of the Photographic
Process", 4th Edition, Chapter 20, Macmillan 1977.It is common practice to minimize the effects of
light scatter by including a light absorbing layer
within the photographic element. To be effective, the
absorption of this layer must be at the same
wavelengths as the sensitivity of the photosensitive
layer. In the case of imaging materials coated on
transparent base, a light absorbing layer is frequently
coated on the reverse side of the base from the
photosensitive layer. Such a coating, known as an
"antihalation layer", effectively prevents reflection
of any light which has passed through the
photosensitive layer.A similar effect may be achieved by a light
absorbing layer interposed between the photosensitive
layer and the base. This construction, described as an
"antihalation underlayer" is applicable to
photosensitive coatings on transparent or non-transparent
bases. It is also possible to improve
image quality by coating a light absorbing layer above
the photosensitive layer of a photographic or
photothermographic element. Coatings of this kind,
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,581,323 and 4,312,941,
