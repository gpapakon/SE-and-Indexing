<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer color photographic element 
having improved reduction in dye stain while having 

reduced color contamination comprises at least one 
cyan color-forming silver halide layer which 

contains a thiacyanine sensitizing dye and at least 
one non-imaging layer containing a 

dialkyhydroquinone. The non-imaging layer is 
adjacent the layer containing the thiacyanine 

sensitizing dye or is in an antihalation layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color 
photographic film element and in particular, a color 
photographic film element having improved reduction 
in dye stain while having reduced color 
contamination. Multilayer color photographic film 
elements contain at least one silver halide emulsion 
layer sensitive to blue light and containing a 
yellow color-forming coupler, at least one silver 
halide emulsion layer sensitive to green light and 
containing a magenta color-forming coupler and at 
least one silver halide emulsion layer sensitive to 
red light and containing a cyan color-forming 
coupler. To enhance the sensitivity to light of the 
desired color, the silver halide grains in the 
layers can be treated with a sensitizing dye. It is 
known to use a thiacyanine dye to increase the 
sensitivity of a silver halide emulsion to red 
light. After imagewise exposure to light, the 
element is processed to develop the desired colored 
image. The exposed silver halide grains react with 
the developing agent in the processing solution and 
oxidized developer (hereinafter referred to as 
"Dox") is produced. The Dox reacts with the dye 
forming couplers to form the desired color. Since 
Dox is created only at exposed silver halide grains, 
color development takes place imagewise. If Dox 
migrates from the layer in which it is produced to 
an adjacent layer containing dye forming coupler of 
a different color, dyes of the wrong color form 
which results in color contamination. To inhibit  
 
such undesired color formation, an intermediate 
layer containing a compound that reacts with Dox, 
(hereinafter called a scavenger) is positioned 
between layers of different sensitivity. Certain photographic elements are 
processed using a reversal process which involves 
developing the exposed silver halide grains in one 
step and then later developing the color image in a 
separate second step. Other photographic elements 
are developed in a single step process in which 
development of the silver halide grains and reaction 
of Dox with color-forming couplers to create the 
color image takes place at the same time. In single 
step processes, the photographic element is in 
contact with the processing solution for a much 
shorter period of time than in a two step process. 
Color negative films are generally processed by 
single step development processing. It has been found that when an 
intermediate layer containing certain common 
scavengers is used in a photographic film element in 
which a thiacyanine dye is used to
