<ABSTRACT>
It has been found that (Ambrosia sp.) and (Apocynum sp.) accumulate lead in the leaves, stems, and roots when it grows in soil containing organic or inorganic species of lead. Lead is accumulated in the leaves and stems to a greater extent than in most other plants. Lead can be economically recovered from contaminated soil and sludge by harvesting (Ambrosia sp.) or (Apocynum sp.) grown in media containing high concentrations of lead.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD OF OBTAINING LEAD AND ORGANOLEAD FROM CONTAMINATED MEDIA USING METAL ACCUMULATING PLANTS FIELD OF INVENTIONThe invention relates to the use of green plants which have the capacity to accumulate high levels of lead in their tissues to remediate contaminated soil and water. The invention relates specifically to the use of Ambrosia sp . (ragweed) and Apocynum sp. (dogbane) in this capacity and to the remediation of lead and lead containing (organolead) compounds.BACKGROUND In recent years contamination of soil and ground water with heavy metals has been identified as a serious environmental hazard. Heavy metals are known to be toxic to most wildlife and man in relatively low concentrations. Elements such as lead, platinum, mercury, cadmium, cobalt, zinc, tin, arsenic, and chromium are used in many industrial applications and often significant levels of these metals are found in industrial waste streams. Heavy metals are also found in organic form such as organoarsenic and organotin, used as pesticides or herbicides, as well as nickel tetracarbonyl and tetraethyllead produced as by-products of the petroleum industry.A number of methods have been described to remediate soil and ground water containing toxic chemicals. These methods primarily focus on concentration and removal or containment of contaminated media or on the use of microbes to enzymatically transform toxins to inert forms. Revis et al. (U.S. Patent No. 4,826,602) claim that contacting aqueous waste with a culture of Pseudomonas altophilica ATCC 53510 will reduce the concentration of ionic species of 

heavy metals. Colaruotolo et al. (U.S. Patent No. 4,511,657) teach the use of specially adapted microbial cultures to treat obnoxious waste, especially halogenated organic chemical waste (U.S. Patent No. 4,493,895) .The use of bioreactors and in-situ stimulation of indigenous microflora are two current approaches to the decontamination of soil and ground water. Bioreactors have been designed to utilize microorganisms for the bioremedia ion of a variety of toxic contaminants, including trichloroethylene, phenol and toluene. (Folsom et al. 1991 Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 57:1602-1608) . In-situ bioremediation involves the growth of indigenous, contaminant-degrading microorganisms which are enhanced by adding nutrients and oxygen. Raymond (U.S. Patent No. 3,846,290 and U.S. Patent No. 4,588,506) teaches a process in which oxygen and nutrients are supplied to biota for stimulating the biooxidation of hydrocarbons contaminating

C AIMS 1. A method of obtaining lead from a medium containing lead, comprising:
(i) growing one of more Ambrosia sp. or Apocynum sp . plants in a medium containing organic or inorganic lead species under conditions suitable for growth of Ambrosia sp . or Apocynum sp . for a time sufficient for plants parts to accumulate lead; (ii) harvesting the plants from the medium; and (iii) concentrating the lead. 2. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the medium is liquid medium, solid medium, semi-solid medium or a combination thereof. 3. A method according to Claim 1 further comprising adding to the medium nutrients necessary for plant growth.
4. A method according to Claim 2 wherein the medium is soil, sludge, or compost. 5. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the harvesting is carried out on plant parts.
6. A method according to Claim 5 wherein a sufficient portion of the plant remains after harvesting to continue plant growth. 7. A method according to Claim 1 wherein concentration of the lead is carried out by dehydrating, incinerating, smelting, aerobic digesting, or anaerobic digesting of the plant parts .
8. A method according to Claim 1 wherein lead is accumulated at a concentration of from about 100 mgPb/kg to about 8000 mgPb/kg dry weight of the plant.
9. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the Ambrosia sp . or Apocynum sp . are harvested two or more times.
