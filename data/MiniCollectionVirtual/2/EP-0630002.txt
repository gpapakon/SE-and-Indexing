<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical disks technology. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a method of simultaneous writing 
data on a plurality of tracks of an optical disk. In a previous Israeli patent application No. 101,570 filed April 10, 1992 
by the same applicants herein (corresponding to European Patent 
Application No. 93105995.0 and to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 
08/043,254, filed April 6, 1993, the specification of which is incorporated 
herein by reference), an optical reading head for reading data tracks of 
optical disks, an apparatus enabling locking, tracking and reading data 
from many data tracks of an optical disk were described. This device 
comprises an optical apparatus for fast addressing of tracks on the disk, 
optical apparatus for imaging the tracks on a detector matrix comprising 
a plurality of detectors arranged in parallel lines, the said detector matrix 
being coupled to a plurality of shift registers, on which processing of the 
image is possible. The said device further comprises signal processing means to receive the 
data generated by the detector matrix, and to translate the said data into 
data contained in data spots located on the disk.  The invention described in IL 101,570 is further directed to a method of 
accessing and reading data from an optical disk, which method comprises 
the steps of: 
1) providing means for illuminating the required part of the disk 
and acquiring the optical image of a plurality of tracks; 2) providing a detector matrix comprising a plurality of detectors, 
each of the said detectors being capable of producing an output 
signal which is proportional to the intensity of the light detected 
by it; 3) causing an optical image corresponding to an illuminated area 
to fall on the said detector matrix; 4) transferring the output signal of the said detector matrix to 
image processing means; 5) determining position coordinates of the track center for each 
data track, by analyzing the output signal of the said detector 
matrix; 6) saving in memory means expected track center data, 
comprising position coordinates of the track center located by the 
said analysis of the output signal; and  7) if an actually detected track center is shifted with respect to 
the said expected track center, electronically moving the track 
center position. According to one embodiment of the abovementioned invention, at the 
beginning of the operation a so-called "locking" operation is carried out, to 
determine the track center, and the
