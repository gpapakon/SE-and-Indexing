<ABSTRACT>
An excellent welding tip in the feed stability of a 
wire and in the release capacity of foreign matters and in 

the stability of current control and a process for 
manufacturing such a tip economically was disclosed. A 

sectional shape of a guide hole (31) opened and provided to a 
welding tip (30) is made by forming a wire in a passable 

non-circular shape. The sectional shape of the guide hole 
may be a polygonal, elliptic or approximate shape to each of 

them. In the case of making the sectional shape of the 
guide hole polygonal, it is more preferable to make it a 

polygon circumscribing on a circle, for example, such a 
polygon circumscribing on a larger circle than the outer 

diameter of the wire to be inserted into the guide hole by 
0.02 - 0.20mm in diameter. Specifically, it is preferable 

to arrange it with a triangle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding wire-guiding
tip, as known from, for example DE-A-3 330 335, and the methods
of making such a tip.A wire to be used as a conventional electrode for gas
metal arc (abbreviated as a GMA thereafter) welding, and a
filler wire to be used to a non-consumable electrode arc
welding, which is represented by a tungsten inert gas arc
(abbreviated as TIG thereafter) welding, have their round
shapes in cross section, and a guide hole of the welding tip
for guiding the wire to weld portion has each round shape in
cross section.Fig. 10 is a sectional view showing a current contact
tip for the GMA welding and its guide hole 2 both of which
haver been known in the prior art. Usually, the length L of
a tip 1 is about 40 mm, and a stepwise round guide hole 2
whose diameter is larger on the side of a tip inlet portion
3 and smaller on the side of a tip outlet portion 4 is 
provided to the center portion in its radial direction. The
diameter D of a large diameter portion is set to a larger
value than the diameter of the wire described above by about
1 mm, and the diameter d of a small diameter portion is set
to a larger value than the diameter of the wire described
above by 0.2 -0.4 mm, for example, in the case that the
diameter of a wire passing through it is about 1.2 mm.
Chromium-copper or beryllium copper are normally used to the
material of the tip 1 for welding to the wire for GMA from
the viewpoints of abrasion resistance and current contact.
The wire is supplied from the side of the tip inlet portion
3 in its more or less bent condition so that the current
contact may be firmly carried out at the tip outlet portion
4. Fig. 11 is a sectional view showing a tip outlet 4 and
illustrates such a condition that a wire 5 passes through
the guide hole 2 of the tip 1. The current contact is
carried out in the form that the wire 5 having a round shape
in cross section may be brought into contact with the inside
of the guide hole 2 having a circular shape in cross section
at one point between a line and a point.This welding tip 1 is mounted on an unillustrated
welding torch, which is used to a semiautomatic welding or
loaded on a welding robot. In the case that the welding
torch 1 is loaded on the welding robot, the wire 5 is
usually taken out of the tip 1 while the condition at the
time of welding is assumed, and the welding route is stored 
by tracing the welding groove at the tip of the wire 5, and
then, the welding is carried out by play backing. In the
process for tracing the
