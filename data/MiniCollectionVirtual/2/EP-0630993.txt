<ABSTRACT>
A zinc or zinc alloy electroplated metal sheet comprises a 
metal sheet having, on at least one surface thereof, a 

composite zinc or zinc alloy plated coating formed by 
electroplating with zinc or a zinc alloy in a plating solution 

which contains at least one organic compound selected from the 
group consisting of alkynes, alkynols, amines and salts 

thereof, thio compounds, heterocyclic compounds, and aromatic 
carboxylic acids and salts thereof. The composite plated 

coating has a coating weight of 0.5 - 200 g/m² and contains 
0.001 - 10 wt% of co-deposited carbon. The electroplated metal 

sheet has improved post-painting corrosion resistance, press 
formability, and spot weldability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite zinc- or zinc alloy-plated 
metal sheet which has good press formability and good 
bare (as-plated) and post-painting corrosion resistance as well 
as a remarkably improved spot weldability and which can be 
improved in low-temperature impact resistance. This invention 
also relates to a method for the production of such a plated 
metal sheet The composite zinc- or zinc alloy-plated metal 
sheet is suitable for use in automobiles, electric appliances, 
and building materials. Surface-treated steel sheets are used in various 
applications including automobiles, electric appliances, and 
building materials. In particular, the use of rust-preventing 
steel sheets having a rust preventive surface coating formed 
thereon has been promoted in automobiles, particularly in 
automobile panels, to be sold in cold regions, in which they 
are exposed to a severe corrosive environment due to the use of 
rock salt on roads in order to prevent freezing. As rust-preventing 
steel sheets are used in an increased quantity, 
requirements therefor with respect to rust preventing 
properties have become increasingly strict. For example, such 
steel sheets are required to have a long-term corrosion 
resistance intended to resist perforative corrosion for 10 
years and surface rusting for 5 years. In addition to corrosion resistance, rust-preventing steel 
sheets are required to have press formability capable of 
withstanding severe press forming such as deep drawing, and 
spot weldability enabling bonding by resistance spot welding, 
which is widely employed, particularly by continuous spot 
welding with an increased number of weld spots. They are also 
desired to have post-painting corrosion resistance, i.e., the 
capability of forming a painted film having good adhesion in a 
painting step subsequent to a press forming step such that they 
exhibit corrosion resistance in areas where the painted film is 
injured and in edge faces. Furthermore, it is desired that  
 
rust-preventing steel sheets for use in outer panels of 
automobiles to be sold in cold regions have cold temperature 
impact resistance good enough to prevent the adhesion of the 
rust-preventive surface coating from being damaged by an 
impact, e.g., caused by hitting a pebble thereon in a low-temperature 
region (-50°C to 0°C). The most popular rust-preventing steel sheets are zinc-plated, 
steel sheets prepared by electroplating or hot dipping 
(galvanizing) with zinc metal. However, zinc-plated steel 
sheets do not have
