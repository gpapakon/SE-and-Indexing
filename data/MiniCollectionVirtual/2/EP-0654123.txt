<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic fuel injector (30) has a tubular non-magnetic body (32) defined by radially inner and outer side walls (34, 36) bounding an annular shaped interior which contains a tubular solenoid coil (54) and an annular valve element (56) that is operated by said solenoid coil (54) to open and close the fuel injector (30). The radially inner wall (34) bounds a central through-hole in the body (32) that allows the stem (24) of an engine intake valve (18) to pass through the fuel injector (30), thereby enabling the fuel injector (30) to be mounted on the manifold (12) directly over the valve head (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to internal combustion engines, and 
specifically to the mounting of a fuel injector on the engine. It is known to mount an electromechanical fuel injector on an 
engine intake manifold runner to direct the fuel injections toward the head 
of the intake valve that controls the introduction of combustible air/fuel 
mixture into a combustion chamber space (i.e., cylinder) that is served by 
the runner. Directing fuel injections directly against the head of an engine 
intake valve is typically deemed desirable because it avoids wetting the 
surrounding manifold or runner wall and because it promotes better fuel 
atomization due to the relatively higher temperature of the valve head 
when the engine is running. Generally speaking, the fuel injector's nozzle 
is located at a distance from the valve head, and it and/or or the 
accommodations required for mounting it may protrude into the airflow 
sufficiently to create some restriction on the airflow. If the straight line 
distance between the fuel injector's nozzle and the target on the valve 
head is not coaxial with the fuel injector's axis, the fuel injector is 
constructed to deliver what is sometimes referred to as a 'bent stream' 
injection (meaning that the direction of injection is not coaxial with the fuel 
injector's axis) so that the injections will be directed to the intended target. US 4,020,803 teaches an intake valve in a stratified charge internal 
combustion engine that is reciprocated linearly along its own axis for 
controlling the introduction of combustible air-fuel mixture from an intake 
system into the pre combustion chamber of the engine. An 
electromechanical fuel injector is disposed to inject fuel into the mixing 
chamber of the intake system toward the auxiliary intake valve. The axis of 
the fuel injector and the axis of the auxiliary intake valve are co-axial. The 
fuel injector has nozzle structure with an annulus surrounding the co-axis, 
and containing one or more fuel injecting apertures disposed eccentric to 
the co-axis and from which injected fuel leaves the fuel injector. The 
injector is either dependently controlled with the actuation of the intake 
valve or is independently controlled. DE-A-2 547 036 teaches mechanically operated combination 
injection valve and intake valve actuator. EP -A-0 128 646 teaches an 
edge mounted fuel injector wherein the ejected fuel is directed toward the 
intake valve and the wall of the manifold. The object of the present invention is to provide a

An internal combustion engine (10) having an intake valve 
(18) reciprocated linearly along its own axis for controlling the introduction 

of combustible air-fuel mixture from an intake system (12, 14) into a 
combustion chamber space (16), and an electromechanical fuel injector 

(30) disposed to inject fuel into the intake system toward the intake valve, 
the fuel injector having a tubular solenoid coil (54) that is disposed around 

its own axis and that is electrically energized and de-energized to control 
fuel injections from the fuel injector, the intake valve having a valve stem 

(24) and a valve head (22), wherein the axis of the solenoid coil and the 
axis of the intake valve are disposed on a co-axis (20), the fuel injector 

has nozzle structure (60, 61, 62) from which injected fuel leaves the fuel 
injector, the nozzle structure has an annulus surrounding the co-axis, and 

contains one or more fuel injecting apertures (61') disposed eccentric to 
the co-axis,

fuel directly against the valve head.

annular shaped valve element (56) that is reciprocated axially in response 
to the energizing and de-energizing of the solenoid coil.

apertures is constructed and arranged to inject fuel generally along a 
direction (70) that is parallel to said co-axis.

characterized further in that the intake valve is reciprocated by the 

energizing and de-energizing of a further tubular solenoid coil (26) having 
its own axis, and the axis of said further tubular solenoid coil is also 

disposed on said co-axis.
