<ABSTRACT>
Systems and methods for providing digital direct write electron beam lithography are described. An apparatus includes a digitally addressable field emitter array (430); an electrostatic accelerator grid (450) operably connected to the addressable field emitter array; and a magnetic lens assembly (460) operably connected to the electrostatic accelerator grid. The systems and methods provide advantages in that a higher resolution pattern is written in a lithographic resist without the need for either scanning or a mask and the electron beam matrix generated by the emitter array can be readily reprogrammed, thereby providing an ideal flexible manufacturing tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DIGITAL DIRECT WRITE ELECTRON BEAM LITHOGRAPHY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the field of electron (i.e., Î² radiation) beams. More particularly, the present invention relates to an addressable field emitter array that produces a spatially modulated electron beam matrix. Specifically, a preferred implementation of the present invention relates to a digitally addressable field emitter array in combination with an electrostatic acceleration grid and a magnetic lens assembly that includes a telecentric magnetic lens system and a correction lens system which together de- magnify the spatially modulated electron beam matrix onto a target wafer so as to directly write an electron resist with minimal distortion. The present invention thus relates to an addressable field emitter array of the type that can be termed lithographic. 2. Discussion of the Related ArtWithin this application several publications are referenced by arabic numerals within parentheses. Full citations for these, and other, publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of all these publications in their entireties are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application for the purposes of indicating the background of the present invention and illustrating the state of the art.Historically, optical lithography for semiconductor wafer production has been limited in resolution by the wavelength of the light source being used. At any particular wavelength of light, diffraction limits the focusability of an optical beam to a circle of a diameter approximately equal to the wavelength of the light source. Consequently, the fabrication industry has evolved several generations of lithographic light sources, each using a shorter wavelength than its predecessors. As microelectronic features have continued to shrink, the resolution of optical lithography is now a barrier to further increasing the density of chip features because suitable light sources of still shorter wavelength 

are no longer readily available. What is needed therefore is a way to increase the resolution of lithography.A previously recognized solution has been to use an electron beam to expose an electron resist that has been coated on the surface of a semiconductor wafer, thereby enabling a pattern to be etched into the surface of the wafer through apertures formed in the subsequently developed resist. Electron beam technology is already
