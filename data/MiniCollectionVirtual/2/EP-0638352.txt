<ABSTRACT>
In a membrane module (10) for removing gaseous substances from a gas stream, in particular for exhaust gas purification with the aid of microorganisms, an endless flexible membrane pocket (12) is provided which is arranged folded up or coiled in a housing together with a flexible support structure (14) as a spacer and essentially fills the interior of the housing. The thickness of the support structure (14) determines the width of the space which remains free between the individual layers of the membrane pocket (12) arranged one over the other and through which the gas to be purified must flow. The membrane pocket (12) is charged with a liquid reaction mixture from a single inlet (18) and drained through a single outlet (20), the gas stream flowing through the housing and the support structure (14) which is arranged between the individual layers of the membrane pocket (12). For the membrane pocket (12) there is used in particular a microporous oriented PTFE membrane which has a continuous surface-covering coating made of a hydrophilic material, in particular having a water vapour permeability of at least 1000 g per m
