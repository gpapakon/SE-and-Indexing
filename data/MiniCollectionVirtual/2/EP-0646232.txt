<ABSTRACT>
Zone-defending weapon system, of the type consisitng of an offensive device (1) comprising at least one barrel (12) for launching ammunition, the projectile (13) thereof containing, for example, an explosive charge, and at least one device (2) for searching and acquiring targets (3) which monitors a surveillance zone (Z) to detect a target (3) entering said zone and control the offensive device (1) for firing the main projectile in the direction of the detected target (3). The offensive device (1) is located at a distance from the target searching and acquiring device (3), the surveillance zone (Z) being located in the action radius of the offensive device (1). The searching device (2) advantageously consists of an auxiliairy projectile (20) fired from the offensive device (1).

<CLAIMS>
A zone-defense system comprising:

at least one surveillance and target-acquisition
device which monitors a surveillance zone to detect a

target penetrating intro it,
an attack device having at least one launcher tube
for a main projectile whose firing at a detected target is

controlled by the surveillance and acquisition device,
the attack device (1) being located at a distance
from the surveillance and target (3) acquisition device

(2) and the surveillance zone (Z) being located in the
radius of action of the attack device (1),

   system 
characterized in that

   each surveillance and target (3) acquisition device
(2) is formed by an auxiliary projectile (20) fired

towards the surveillance zone by means of an auxiliary
launcher tube (25) of the attack device (1) and intended

to have a point of impact on the ground, the main
projectile fired by the attack device having a ballistic

trajectory such that it is intended to arrive within the
surveillance zone in the immediate vicinity of the point

of impact on the ground of the auxiliary projectile (20).
A zone-defense weapon system according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the main projectile has a zone of

effectiveness at least equal to that of the surveillance
zone in question.
A zone-defense weapon system according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the attack device (1) is located

outside of the surveillance zone (Z).
A zone-defense weapon system according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it comprises several

surveillance and target (3) acquisition devices (2) which

respectively monitor several surveillance zones (Z1,
Z2,...), and in that the attack device (1) has a tube

which can be aimed in the direction of the surveillance 
and target-acquisition device having commanded the firing

order of the main projectile.
A zone-defense weapon system according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it comprises several

surveillance and target (3) acquisition devices (2) which
respectively monitor several surveillance zones (Z1,

Z2,...), and in that the attack device (1) comprises
several launcher tubes (12) of a main projectile, each

surveillance and target (3) acquisition device (2) being
dedicated to a launcher tube (12).
A zone-defense weapon system according to one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that each auxiliary

projectile (20) forming a surveillance and target (3)
acquisition device (2) incorporates at least one sensor

(21) of the acoustic, seismic or magnetic variety to
detect the presence of a target (3) penetrating into the

surveillance zone (Z), an electronic processing unit (22)
to analyse the signals picked up by the sensor (21), a

device (23) to transmit a warning signal to a reception
device (30) of the attack device (1), and a source of

electrical power (24).
A zone-defense weapon system according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the reception device (30) of the

attack device (1) can give the firing order for the
auxiliary projectile (20) in response to an activation

order remotely transmitted by an operator.
A zone-defense weapon system according to one of
Claims 6 or 7, characterized in that the attack device (1)

comprises a long distance warning device (31) to monitor
the approach of a target (3) at distances further than

that at which the surveillance zone (Z) is to be located,
and give the order to fire the auxiliary projectile (20).
A zone-defense weapon system according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the auxiliary projectile (20) is

fired automatically after a set electronic or pyrotechnic
delay or one which can be programmed when the system is

set in place.
