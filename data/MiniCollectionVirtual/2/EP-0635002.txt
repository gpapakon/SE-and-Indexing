radical and the symbol R"' represents a hydrogen atom, or
the symbols R" and R"' represent hydroxyl radicals, or
the symbol R" forms a bond with R"', and
the symbol R° represents a hydrogen atom or represents
a protective radical, chosen from alkyloxycarbonyl,

benzyloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted benzyl or
formyl, chloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl,

vinyloxycarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl, 1-chloroethoxycarbonyl
or chlorocarbonyl,

form, as well as its salts, where they exist.

radicals,
the symbol R' represents a phenyl radical which is
optionally substituted in position 2 by an alkyl or

alkyloxy radical containing 1 or 2 carbon atoms,
the symbol R" represents a fluorine atom or a hydroxyl

radical and the symbol R"' represents a hydrogen atom,
or
