<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a yogurt 
having healthy components. As is known, yogurt is conventionally made 
by means of a fermentation method carried on milk 
added with coagulative products. To the thus made yogurt there are conventionally 
added other elements, usually fruit pieces, 
having the function of modifying the flavour of the 
yogurt so as to render it more pleasant and agreeable. The yogurt formulations which are made at present, 
however, do not provide a product joining to 
the typical features of the yogurt some healthy 
functions. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to provide a yogurt including components having 
healthy functions, thereby providing an actually 
natural and healthy food. Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, 
a main object of the present invention is to provide 
such a yogurt which can be made exclusively by using 
healthy components, that is by omitting any flavour  
 
products. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a yogurt which, owing to its peculiar 
structural features, is adapted to greatly improve 
its organoleptic properties. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide a yogurt which includes several healthy 
features, depending on the combination of its 
components. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as well 
as yet other objects, which will be more apparent 
hereinafter, are achieved by a yogurt including 
components heaving healthy functions, characterized 
in that it comprises a lean yogurt, sugared by 9.4% 
saccharose, and being mixed with mash and fruit 
juices and with natural extracts, obtained by a 
full extraction of highly concentrated vegetable 
raw materials, so as to provide a high contents of 
active or characteristic principles. Further characteristics and advantages of 
the present invention will become more apparent 
from the following detailed disclosure of a preferred  
 
embodiment of the subject yogurt including 
components having healthy functions. In particular the yogurt according to the 
present invention is made by mixing with a lean yogurt, 
which has been sugared by 9.4% saccharose, a homogeneous 
fruit material or vegetable original natural 
extracts. The homogeneous fruit material usually comprises 
natural mash and fruit juices, selected with 
such doses and types to provide a great improving 
of the overall organoleptic and healthy properties. The natural extracts, in particular, are obtained 
by a full extraction
