<ABSTRACT>
In a membrane module for gaseous substance removal from a gas stream, having membrane pockets of gas-permeable liq.-tight material arranged parallel to one another and to the gas steam flow direction, the novelty is that (a) each membrane pocket (11) is edge-sealed to the bottom (8) of a prefabricated support plate (1) with liq. supply and discharge openings (7), the top (16) of the support plate (1) having a series of adjacent parallel flow channels (12) for the gas stream, the channel walls being formed as spacer elements by parallel ribs (5) in a region of the top (16) of the plate (1); (b) common feed and discharge bores (6), for all the membrane pockets (11), are provided in the plate side regions adjacent the ribbed region; (c) the support plates (1) are stacked such that the membrane(s) (9) of each membrane pocket (11) are supported on the free edges (17) of the ribs (5) of an adjacent support plate (1) and such that the open tops of the flow channels (12) are covered; and (d) the feed and discharge bores (6) of the plates (1) are aligned to form channels passing completely through the stack. Pref. each membrane (9) consists of a first hydrophobic layer of micro-porous stretched PTFE foil, joined to a second hydrophilic layer which may be a polyurethane coating, a polyether-polyurethane layer on a perfluorosulphonic acid membrane.
