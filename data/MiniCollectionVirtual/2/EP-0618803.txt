<DESCRIPTION>
 CETP INHIBITOR POLYPEPTIDE, ANTIBODIESAGAINST THE SYNTHETIC POLYPEPTIDE AND PROPHYLACTICAND THERAPEUTIC ANTI-ATHEROSCLEROSIS TREATMENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe work leading to the present invention was partially supported by National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Grants Nos. HL28972 and HL41256, and Contract No. HV53030. The government may hold rights in the present patent.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to an endogenous baboon plasma cholesteryl esters transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor polypeptide. More specifically, this invention relates to the identification and characterization of the polypeptide and to novel synthetic peptides possessing inhibitory activity of CETP. The endogenous inhibitory peptide has a molecular weight of 4000, is present in plasma in the form of modified apo A-I and apo E having molecular weights of 31kD and 41kD, respectively, and has a common amino acid sequence with the N-terminal fragment of apo C-I. This invention also relates to an anti- atherosclerosis composition, a kit, and to antibodies raised against the N-teπninal amino acid sequence of the inhibitory polypeptide. The inhibitory peptide of the invention, fragments thereof and analogues thereof are useful for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of atherosclerosis.Description of the BackgroundAtherosclerosis is one of the most widespread health problems in the United States today as are its attendant complications, particularly coronary heart disease. A number of risk factors have been associated with the development of premature atherosclerosis, primarily elevated 

 plasma cholesterol levels. Due to the crucial role cholesterol appears to play in the occurrence of heart disease, a great deal of attention has been devoted to studying its synthesis, transport and metabolism in the human body.Of particular interest is the establishment of relationships between the levels of plasma lipoproteins or serum lipids and the risk of development of coronary heart disease. Both high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol mainly in the form of cholestryl esters (CE). There are some indications, however, that while LDL cholesterol is a positive risk factor, HDL cholesterol is an even more important negative risk factor. Although the exact functions of these lipoproteins have not been completely established, HDL appears to serve for the removal of cholesterol from peripheral cells and its transport back to the liver, where a large proportion of the cholesterol
