<ABSTRACT>
A gamma radiation dosimeter comprises a polyester 
film substrate 10, of which a central circular region 

12 is coated with a gamma-radiation sensitive layer 14 
which is covered by an overlayer 16. The radiation-sensitive 

layer 14 is formed from styrene-acrylonitrile 
copolymer and contains 1-bromoadamantane 

and a leuco dye. The overlayer 16 is formed from an 
acrylic resin binder containing a UV-absorber. The 

central region 12 is surround by an annular region 18 
which is divided into six equally-sized sections 

18a.....18f. Each section 18a.....18f is printed in a 
colour which corresponds to the colour developed in 

the central region 14 when it has been exposed to 
successive increasing amounts of gamma radiation. 

After exposure of the device, the amount of radiation 
to which the device has been exposed can be determined 

by comparing the colour generated in the region 14 
with the colours of the sections 18a.....18f. The 

colour of the section most closely corresponding to 
that of the central region indicates the dose of gamma 

radiation which the device, and any other object 
similarly exposed, has received.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the detection of gamma
radiation.Gamma radiation is used for the sterilisation of
medical articles such as surgeons' gowns and masks and
also syringes, implants, etc.Irradiation by gamma rays has also been used as a
means of disinfection and preservation of foods.In the medical field, irradiation by gamma rays
is usually carried out using the isotope 27Co60 as a
source of gamma rays. The radioactive isotope is
incorporated into a steel "pencil" to which the
articles to be sterilised are exposed. There are
various regulations in place governing sterilisation of
medical articles by gamma radiation. Typically it is
required that articles to be sterilised be exposed to
25 kGy of radiation. The level used for treatment of
foodstuffs is typically 1 to 10 kGy. Various devices
have been proposed or manufactured as indicators of
exposure to gamma radiation. One such device
comprises a label carrying a circle of an orange
dyestuff which becomes red on exposure to gamma
radiation. The colour change is however non-quantitative
and there is no indication of the
radiation dose. Moreover, the colour change takes
place slowly during exposure to visible light. It is
also known to supply dosimeters consisting of coloured
polymethylmethacrylate plastic "chips" which undergo a
colour change upon exposure to gamma radiation. The
colour change can however only be measured
spectrophotometrically and such measurement is
therefore necessary in order to ascertain the dose of
radiation exposure.US-A-2957080 (Schulte et al) describes the
determination of quantities of gamma radiation and X-radiation 
by the exposure of a detection system
comprising a halogenated compound and a leuco dye
which functions as a sensitiser and indicator. The
detection system is a liquid-phase system which
requires subsequent colorimetric measurement of the
colour produced in order to determine the quantity of
radiation to which the detection system has been
exposed. Specific halogenated compounds disclosed are
chloroform, bromoform, tetrachloroethane and 1,1,2-trichloroethane.
Specific leuco-dyes are the leuco
bases of crystal violet and malachite green.GB-A-1180883 (Horizons) describes a
photosensitive medium which is sensitive to radiation
of wavelengths longer than 400 nm. The medium
consists of (a) a leuco compound, (b) a halogen-containing
activator and (c) a polymer in which (a)
and (b) are dispersed or dissolved. A latent, non-visible
image is produced in the photosensitive medium
upon exposure to radiation of the
