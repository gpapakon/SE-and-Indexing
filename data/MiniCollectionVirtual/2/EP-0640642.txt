<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of producing dimethylpolysiloxanes through 
hydrolysis of dimethyldichlorosilane wherein a water solution containing 

a water-soluble oxygen-containing organic compound is introduced into 
dimethyldichlorosilane. Therein, linear dimethylpolysiloxanes alone 

whose both ends are blocked with chlorine atoms can be selectively 
produced by properly controlling the water content in the hydrolysis 

system and further by rendering the hydrolysis system acidic, and cyclic 
dimethylpolysiloxanes alone can also be selectively produced by 

properly controlling the water content in the hydrolysis system and 

optionally rendering the hydrolysis system acidic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
dimethylpolysiloxanes and, more particularly, to a method of selectively
producing cyclic dimethylpolysiloxanes alone.GB-A-631 018 describes a process for making linear halogen-terminated dimethylsiloxanes where a mixture of dioxane and water is added to dimethylhalosilane and where the molar ratio of water to silane is less than one.A synthesis method for linear methylchloropolysiloxanes has
already been reported by Winton Patnode and Donald F. Wilcock in J. Am.
Chem. Soc., volume 68, page 358 (1946).In the above-cited method, a mixture of purified water and
dioxane is introduced into dimethyldichlorosilane dissolved in a large
quantity of diethyl ether. However, using a large quantity of diethyl
ether is dangerous in handling and impairs the production efficiency per
unit volume. Therefore, that method has a defect of having no
suitability for production on an industrial scale.In addition, the foregoing report describes experimental results
such that the mixture of linear methylchloropolysiloxanes with cyclic
dimethylpolysiloxanes is produced when purified water by itself is
introduced into dimethyldichlorosilane alone, the linear product and
the cyclic product thus obtained are hard to separate because their
boiling points are very close to each other, and the linear
methylchloropolysiloxanes which are more useful than the cyclic product
are produced therein in low yields.In order to solve the above-described problems, therefore, we
have made intensive studies. As a result of it, it has been found out
that in hydrolyzing dimethyldichlorosilane by introducing thereinto a
water solution containing a water-soluble oxygen-containing organic 
compound cyclic dimethylpolysiloxanes alone can be selectively produced by
properly controlling the quantity of water introduced into the
hydrolysis system and, if desired, the water solution is rendered
acidic; thereby achieving the present invention.An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a
dimethylpolysiloxane-producing method which enables selective production
of
cyclic dimethylpolysiloxanes alone.The above-described object of the present invention is attained
with a method of producing dimethylpolysiloxanes which comprises
carrying out hydrolysis by introducing into dimethyldichlorosilane a
water solution containing a water-soluble oxygen-containing organic
compound as specified in present claim 1.Fig. 1 shows an apparatus used for the synthesis reactions
according to the present
