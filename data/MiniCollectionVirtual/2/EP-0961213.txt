<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for differentiating customers according to their worth to the casino.
Customer information is accumulated at each affiliated casino through one or more LAN-based

management systems, updated to a central patron database (CPDB) that is coupled to each casino
LAN through a WAN, and made available to each affiliated casino property as needed.

Customer accounts are automatically activated and provided with data from the CPDB when a
customer from one casino property first visits an affiliated casino property. Customer accounts

are updated with status information based on the customer's worth to the casino. Customer
accounts are updated with new activity data whenever a management system associated with the

casino receives customer data from input devices, such as card readers, workstations, and dumb
terminals, located at various venues throughout the casino. Customers are awarded points, based

on their tracked activity at all affiliated casino properties. Customers also have theoretical win
profiles. Customer status may be based on accumulated points or the theoretical win profile.

When the customer is recognized at a gaming machine, or any location having a suitable card
reader, the customer's status is determined in the customer account. For a special status

customer, a physical instrumentality is activated for the benefit of the customer, such as a
telephone, light, lockable cabinet, or the like. Distinguished services may also be provided once

the special status customer is recognized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent 5,761,647, entitled
National Customer Recognition System and Method, filed on May 24, 1996 and issued on June 2,
1998, and assigned to the same assignee as the present application.Technical Field This invention relates to the field of systems for tracking customer
activity at casinos, and in particular, to systems for tracking customers' gaming and non-gaming
activity across affiliated casino properties, for use in customer recognition and marketing
programs.Background Art Substantially all casinos have implemented some form of customer
tracking to identify and reward their valuable customers. These tracking programs often use the
betting activity of a customer as the basis for awarding the customer complementary rooms,
meals, event tickets, and the like ("comps"). Typically, these tracking programs are implemented
by providing each customer with a casino membership card which includes a machine readable
identification number specific to the customer. Each identification number has an associated
customer account that is stored in the casino's computer system and updated to reflect customer
activity. Customers need only insert their cards in slot machines or card readers associated with
gaming tables or give their cards to a casino employee to have their betting activity monitored
and reflected in their accounts. Customer cards may also be used to track customer activity at 
casino venues, such as special events, showrooms, and hotels, through card readers and computer
terminals manned by casino employees.The growth of the gaining industry has created new challenges to the way in which
customer tracking programs are implemented. Many states and territories have recently legalized
casino gambling, and companies have built casino properties at these new gaming locations to
meet the demand for gaming facilities. Despite the increased number of casino properties
affiliated with a company, conventional casino management practices continue to treat these
casino properties as autonomous, decentralized entities that compete with each other for valuable
customers. In particular, customer tracking at each casino property is typically controlled by
local management, and few if any attempts have been made to coordinate customer information
across affiliated casino properties. For example, each casino has its own system that tracks
betting data on the casino's customers. The property treats this betting data as confidential, in
order to prevent
