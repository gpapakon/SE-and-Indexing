<ABSTRACT>
A lunch box (10) including a tray (12) and a removable lid (14) with 
a rear, separable hinge assembly and a forward manually 

releasable latch assembly. The latch assembly includes a 
front panel (40) on the tray (12) with longitudinally spaced pressure 

pads (52) and forwardly projecting detents (54) which engage with 
corresponding detents (68) on the depending front wall (58) of the 

lid (14). 
Simultaneous rearward pressure on the two pressure pads (52) 

rearwardly release the tray detents (54) from the lid detents (68) and 
free the lid (14) for removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
Lunch boxes are normally rather bulky items with 
hinge-mounted lids which, while acceptable for the containing 
and carrying of foodstuffs, are not particularly attractive, 
not conveniently carried and do not lend themselves for use as 
the actual serving dish for the food. Also, the more commonly known lunch boxes frequently 
utilize rather elaborate latch mechanisms and hinge structures 
which are not necessarily easy to operate or effective in 
retaining the closure. Another problem frequently encountered in known lunch 
boxes is the lack of any provision for the convenient 
accommodation of eating utensils. The lunch box of the present invention will be 
particularly acceptable for adult use in that the lunch box is  
 
of a rather streamline compact configuration easily carried 
within a briefcase, provides an attractive appearance, and is 
not in fact readily discernible as a lunch box. It is significant that the lunch box includes a lid 
which is completely removable, allowing the tray to be used as 
a serving dish for the direct consuming of foodstuffs 
therefrom. This is particularly desirable when the foodstuff 
is other than hand food such as sandwiches and the like. An 
appropriate sealing gasket is incorporated into the lid to 
effectively seal the lunch box both before and after consuming 
the foodstuff whereby preservation of the foodstuff is assured 
and the escape of any aromas associated with the residue 
remaining is effectively avoided. The distinctive latch mechanism or assembly of the 
invention is integrally formed with the tray and lid and, 
while mechanically simple and trouble free, is unique in its 
construction and the manner in which a positive latching of 
the lid to the tray is provided. The latch mechanism, 
comprising dual latches, while easy to manipulate, 
substantially precludes accidental or inadvertent release of 
the lid. As above indicated, upon release of the latch 
mechanism, the lid itself is completely removable from the 
tray.  A further significant feature of the invention is the 
provision of a separate storage compartment or pocket for the 
eating utensils, for example chopsticks. The utensils are 
retained exterior of the food compartment yet within the 
confines of the mounted lid. Structurally, the tray of the lunch box is preferably 
rectangular with the lid of a complementary configuration. 
The top wall of the lid includes a defined groove which 
receives the sealing gasket for engagement with the peripheral 
upper edge of the tray to effect a

A lunch box (10) comprising a tray (12) and a lid 
(14), said tray (12) including opposed front and rear tray 

walls (20, 18), said lid (14) including opposed front and rear 
lid walls (58, 60), said lid (14) being removably received in 

a closed position over said tray (12) with said lid front and 
rear walls (58, 60) generally paralleling said tray front and 

rear walls (20, 18) respectively, hinge means (26, 64) on and 
engaged between said tray and lid rear walls (18, 60), and 

latch means (40, 54, 68) on and engaged between said tray (12) 
and lid (14), said latch means including a tray latch 

component (40, 54) and a lid latch component (68), said lid 
latch component comprising lid detent means (68) on said lid 

front wall (58), said tray latch component comprising panel 
means (40) joined to said tray front wall (20) in spaced 

relation thereto between said tray and lid front walls (20, 
58), and tray detent means (54
) on said panel means (40) 
engaged with said lid detent means (68) for retaining said lid 

(14) on said tray (12), said panel means (40) being 
selectively manually flexible away from said lid front wall 

(58) for disengagement of said tray detent means (54) from 
said lid detent means (68) for release of said lid (14). 
The lunch box of claim 1 wherein said lid front 
and rear walls (58, 60) are positioned respectively outward of 

said tray front and rear walls (20, 18), said panel means (40) 
including a pair of spaced panel portions (50) flexibly 

movable inward relative to said lid front wall (20), said tray 
detent means (54) comprising a detent (54) on each panel 

portion (50) extending forwardly toward said lid front wall 
(58), said lid detent means (68) comprising detents (68) on 

said lid front wall (58) one aligned and engagable with each 
tray detent (54), each tray detent (54) disengaging from the 

corresponding lid detent (68) upon rearward flexing of the 
corresponding panel portion (50) for release of said latch 

means. 
The lunch box of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said 
hinge means (26, 64) comprises elongate slot means (64) 

defined through said lid rear wall (60), and elongate tabs 
means (26) integrally projecting from said tray rear wall (18) 

and slidably received within and through said slot means (64) 
for selective disengagement therefrom upon rearward movement 

of said lid (14) relative to said tray (12). 
The lunch box of claim 3 including an upwardly 
opening pocket (28) defined on said tray (12) forward of said 

tray front wall (20) and longitudinally therealong, said panel

(28). 
The lunch box of claim 4 wherein said pocket (28) 
is defined by a pocket wall (32) generally parallel to said 

tray front wall (20) and said panel means (40), and a bottom 
wall (36) between said pocket wall (32) and said tray front 

wall (20), said panel means (40) and said pocket wall (32)
