<ABSTRACT>
A method for compounding at least one polymerized alpha-olefin 
resin in an extruder including a screw having a feeding section, a 

melting section, and a venting section, which method comprises: (1) 
introducing the resin and a heat transfer medium into the feeding 

section such that the resin is maintained at a temperature below its 
melting point; (2) transporting the resin and heat transfer medium to 

the melting section such that the resin is at a temperature which is at 
or just above its melting point by sublimation or vaporization of the 

heat transfer medium and kneading the resin at a temperature which 
is at or just above its melting point; (3) passing a resin melt of step (2) 

through a melt seal into a venting section wherein the heat transfer 
medium is released from the extruder; and (4) pumping the resin melt 

out of the extruder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for compounding a 
polymerized alpha-olefin resin in an extruder. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a method for compounding at least one 
polymerized alpha-olefin resin in the presence of a heat transfer 
medium, such as dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide, or liquid nitrogen, to 
improve homogeneity of the polymer product. The polymer product can 
be used to make plastic films having reduced gel formation. Plastic films are characterized by such properties as good tensile 
strength, high ultimate elongation, good impact strength and puncture 
resistance. In addition to these characteristics the films need to 
exhibit esthetic qualities such as a smooth surface appearance. These 
properties together with toughness are relatively easily obtained when 
the polymer resin used to produced the films is polyethylene. However, 
as the molecular weight of the polyethylene increases, the 
processability of the polyethylene usually becomes extremely difficult, 
often requiring excessive energy inputs in a film-forming extruder. To 
improve processability, particularly extrudability in a film-forming 
extruder, a blend of polymers, such as a polyethylene and an alpha 
olefin, is often employed. One of the main reasons for blending is to 
obtain a resin having a set of desired properties such as strength in the 
fabricated article or film while allowing easy processability in the 
fabricating equipment. Blends of a low molecular weight polymer and 
a high molecular weight polymer, such as blend of a low molecular 
weight polyethene and a high molecular weight polyethene each 
having a narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e., a bimodal blend) 
are a particularly attractive route to achieving easy processability 
while increasing the strength of the film or fabricated article.  Three major strategies have been proposed for the production of 
polymer resins used to fabricate films. One is the direct production of 
a resin or a blend of resins having the above-mentioned characteristics 
of toughness and easy processability, via one or more catalysts in a 
single fluidized bed reactor. A second makes use of multi-stage 
reactors operating independently or in series, primarily to produce 
resin blends. A third strategy is a post-reactor or post-multiple reactor 
treatment, such as melt blending a resin or a blend of resins in an 
extruder. In general, polymer resins manufactured employing the above-mentioned 
strategies require a certain degree of homogenization
