<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
intravenous catheter insertion devices, and in
particular relates to a catheter needle tip protector
and a safety mechanism which provides fail/safe
protection to clinical personnel against the possibility
of accidental punctures by a used intravenous (IV)
needle through the provision of automatic catheter
needle tip protecting structure which becomes operative
upon withdrawal of the needle from the body of a
patient.Furthermore, the invention is also directed to
a generally automatic needle tip guarding and catheter
hub releasing mechanism which simultaneously covers the
needle tip upon withdrawal from the body of a patient
while enabling a catheter to remain in the site of the
venipuncture, and releases a Luer lock lug located on
the catheter hub when the cannula of the needle is fully
retracted so as to place the needle tip into a fully
guarded condition.Pursuant to a further embodiment of the
invention, there is also provided a catheter unlocking
mechanism incorporating a tethering line, particularly
with the utilization of a cannula or needle guard in the
form of a bag or bellows for the receipt of the needle
cannula, and incorporates a redundant system adapted to
prevent a nose assembly of the cannula structure from
separating from the cannula and exposing the latter and 
releasing the catheter hub prior to fully guarding the
needle.The utilization of clinical apparatus in which
pointed hollow needles or cannulas are employed in order
to puncture the skin of a patient, and especially
catheters utilizing such needles to effectuate
venipunctures, is well known in the medical art and is
widely practiced by physicians and clinical personnel
for the purpose of injecting fluids and drugs directly
into the bloodstream of patients. Additionally, during
surgical operations or procedures it may be frequently
required that whole blood transfusions and parenteral
fluids be administered to a patient undergoing such
surgical procedures. Basically, as is well known and
has been employed for a considerable length of time, the
introduction of such fluids into the cardiovascular
systems of patients has necessitated the forming of a
venipuncture utilizing a hollow rigid needle having a
proximal attachment site for a fluid connection which is
adapted to interconnect the needle with a source of
intravenously administered fluids.The foregoing method of administering fluids
to patients through venipunctures has been subject to
some rather serious problems in the

<CLAIMS>
A catheter assembly comprising:

(a) a cannula locking and catheter hub unlocking mechanism (10), a housing (14)
and a needle (22) extending from an end of said housing (14), the needle (22)

being adapted to administer a catheter to a patient;
(b) a catheter hub supporting structure for encompassing a portion of the
needle (22) extending from said housing (14);
(c) a catheter slidably mounted on said needle (22), said catheter including
a catheter hub (28) engaged on said catheter hub supporting structure; and
(d) means (26) for locking said catheter hub (28) to said catheter hub supporting
structure in the extended operative position of said needle (22) and for releasing said

catheter hub (28) in the retracted position of said needle (22) while concurrently
forming a protective barrier against the tip of said r
etracted needle (22) when in an
exposed condition;

whereby the mechanism (10) comprises a resiliently biased one-piece component (26)
comprising both a means (46) for clampingly engaging said catheter hub (28) and a plate

element (36);
the means (46) for clampingly engaging said catheter hub (28) is adapted to engage the
catheter hub (28) when the mechanism (10) is in a catheter hub locking or operative condition;

and
the plate element (36) extends through an opening in said catheter hub supporting
structure and has an aperture (24) through which said needle (22) passes to maintain

the mechanism (10) in the catheter hub locking condition;

wherein retraction of the needle (22) through the aperture (24) releases the
mechanism (10);

characterised in that the needle is a cannula needle and that on its release, the
mechanism

then defaults to a catheter hub release condition in which the means
(46) for clampingly engaging said catheter hub (28) is disengaged from the catheter hub (28)

and the aperture (24) is misaligned with the longitudinal axis of the needle (22) thereby locking
the cannula needle (22) behind the plate element (36).
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the one-piece component (26) is in
the form of a T-shaped structure (38), and the means (46) for clampingly engaging said

catheter hub (28) comprises a hook-like projection (46). 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said plate element (36) has
opposite extending arm portions (40,44) at one end; one said arm portion (40) being hingedly

connected to a tab (42) on said housing (14), and the other said end (44) including the means
(46) for clampingly engaging said catheter hub (28).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein at least a portion of said
plate element (36) is resiliently deformable whereby withdrawal of said cannula needle (22)

from said aperture (24) imparts a pivoting motion to said plate element (36) causing said means
(46) for clampingly engaging said catheter hub (28) to disengage from said catheter hub (28) to

enable said catheter to be detached from said assembly.
An assembly as claimed in claim 4, wherein the pivoting motion of said plate
element (36) displaces the aperture (24) relative to the axis of the retracted cannula needle (22)

so as to form a protective barrier against external contact with said retracted cannula needle
(22).
An assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein said the means (46) for clampingly
engaging said catheter hub (28) on said other arm (44) of said plate element (36) comprises a

recess (48), and locking lug means (50) on said catheter hub (28) being engageable in said
recess (48).
An assembly as claimed in claim 6, wherein said locking lug means (50)
comprises components of a Luer lock fitting.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein said plate element (36)
is constituted of a plastics material.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, wherein extendable connecting
means (78) interconnects said catheter hub locking means (26) and said housing (14), whereby

displacement of said housing (14) from said locking means (46) causes said cannula needle
(22) to retract and said connecting means (78) to extend so as to disengage said locking means

(26) from said catheter hub (28). 
An assembly as claimed in claim 9, wherein said connecting means comprises a
tethering line (78) having opposite ends attached to respectively said locking means (26) and

said housing (14).
An assembly as claimed in claim 9 or 10, wherein said locking means (26)
comprises a resiliently deformable plate member (72), and a recess (74) formed at one end of

said plate member (72) for latchingly engaging locking lug means (50) on said catheter hub
(28).
An assembly as claimed in claim 11, wherein extension of said connecting
means (78) deflects said plate member (72) to enable said lug means (50) to disengage from

said recess (74) and release said catheter hub (28) from said assembly.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 9 to 12, wherein a bag or collapsible
bellows (18) encompasses said retracted cannula needle (22) upon extension of said assembly.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 9 to 13, wherein a nose guard (100) is
tethered to said housing (14); and a bag or collapsible bellows (102) extends between said nose

guard (100)and said housing (14) for encompassing the retracted cannula needle (22).
An assembly as claimed in claim 14, wherein a pair of parallel extending strips
form a tether (90) between said nose guard (100) and said housing (14).
An assembly as claimed in claim 15, wherein said strips are portions of a
hooped tether (92).
