<ABSTRACT>
A cryptographic device and method provide a 
repertoire of mappings and associated inverse mappings 

between plaintext and ciphertext vectors. The plaintext 
is partitioned block-by-block, the block size being user-selectable, 

such as N characters. Each mapping maps 
between a pair of N-dimensional plaintext and ciphertext 

vectors. The mapping or associated inverse mapping is 
implemented by a matrix with NxN matrix elements, where 

each element is allowed to take on a range of L values. 
By permuting the matrix elements within their range, the 

repertoire has a size â‰ƒ L
NxN
. This size is immense even 
for moderate values of N and L. The users select one 

mapping or associated inverse mapping among the repertoire 
for respectively effecting the encryption or decryption. 

A secret key shared between the users includes information 
about the selected mapping or associated inverse mapping 

and may include values of N and L. To an outsider not 
privy to the secret key, the task of exhaustive research 

in the repertoire is computationally infeasible, 
especially if N and L are not known. In the preferred 

embodiment, a pseudo-random vector that varies block-by-block 
is added as another component to the ciphertext 

vector. A quick computational method is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
cryptography, and more particularly to devices and methods
for data encryption and decryption controlled by a secret
key.In the modern "electronic" age, day-to-day
commercial, official, and personal transactions are
increasingly being conducted by means of data exchanged
over public telecommunication channels. Sensitive data is
often stored in insecure storage. The data exchanged over
public telecommunication channels or stored in insecure
storage is susceptible to unauthorized access by others,
and confidentiality and privacy cannot be guaranteed.Data encryption is one solution in preventing
unauthorized access of data when in storage or transported
over public telecommunication channels. Encryption is a
form of computation that transforms a plaintext into an
unintelligible ciphertext. Decryption is the inverse
computation of encryption that recovers the plaintext from
the unintelligible ciphertext.In practice, data is first encrypted from
plaintext into ciphertext by an encrypter before being
transported over a public channel or committed to storage.
Upon reception or retrieval of the data, a decrypter must
decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext to obtain the
original data.In a secret-key cryptographical scheme, a secret
key is used to pass information about how the encrypter 
performed the encryption to an authorized decrypter so
that the latter can construct an inverse to effectively
perform the decryption. On the other hand, other
unauthorized decrypters without the key will find it
difficult if not impossible to decrypt the ciphertext.Conventionally, in a secret-key cryptographic
system, there is an established computational sequence of
steps or algorithm for encryption and decryption. A
secret-key cryptographic system is usually designed with
the assumption that the algorithm is publicly known. The
only thing that needs to be kept secret is the secret key
which is shared only between the sender and an authorized
receiver.Typically the key provides a user-selected value
which is taken together with the plaintext as inputs to
the algorithm to effect encryption and decryption.
Usually, the algorithm modifies the plaintext by adding
the key value to it by some modulo arithmetic.In practice, the secret key is privately
communicated from the sender to the authorized receiver
through a secure channel. In this way, the authorized
receiver can efficiently decrypt the ciphertext using the
publicly known algorithm in conjunction with the aid of
the secret key. On the
