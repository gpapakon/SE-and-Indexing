<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
semiconductor laser device, and particularly to a short 
wave semiconductor laser device composed of a II-VI 
compound semiconductor used for information processing 
terminal equipment such as an optical disk, laser beam 
printer or laser television, and a method of fabricating 
the laser device. A conventional semiconductor laser device 
using a II-VI compound semiconductor has a gain 
waveguiding type electrode stripe structure in which an 
alloy of ZnCdSSe or ZnMgSSe is grown on a GaAs 
substrate. The former structure using ZnCdSSe has been 
described, for example in Unexamined Japanese Patent 
Publication No. HEI 3-91270; and the latter structure 
using ZnMgSSe has been described, for example in 
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. HEI 5-75217. 
In these structures, a continuous oscillation at low 
temperatures or a pulse oscillation at room temperature 
can be realized at an oscillation wavelength of about  
 
500 nm (ZnCdSSe system) or about 450 nm (ZnMgSSe 
system). These structures, however, have the following 
disadvantages. The threshold current is relatively 
large because of the gain waveguiding type. It is 
difficult to form an ohmic contact with an electrode 
material because of the wide gap material. The thermal 
expansion strain remains in the device because a III-V 
compound semiconductor is used as a growth substrate. 
It is difficult to design a laser structure with a large 
band continuity between a clad layer and an active layer 
for the ZnCdSSe system being easy in the conducting 
control compared with the ZnMgSSe system, resulting in 
the insufficient confinement of injected charge and 
light. Because of these disadvantages, the above 
structures are difficult to achieve the continuous 
oscillation at room temperature and the operation with a 
high reliability. An object of the present invention is to 
provide a short wave semiconductor laser device composed 
of a II-VI compound semiconductor capable of solving the 
above-described problems.  The present invention basically includes a 
buried type semiconductor laser structure using a II-VI 
compound semiconductor for reducing the threshold 
current and improving the reliability, wherein a multi-layer 
reflection film is provided for achieving the 
short wave oscillation. Concretely, in a buried type 
semiconductor laser device composed of a II-VI compound 
semiconductor, a buried layer is made of a II-VI compound 
semiconductor having a refraction factor lower than that 
of an active
