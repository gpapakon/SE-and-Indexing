<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for closing or at least partially opening a panel (cover) (27) of a tilt-and-slide roof, with a drive carriage (13) which is mounted displaceably on guide rails (1) fixed on the roof, is connected to a deploying lever (3) for raising or lowering the panel (27) and is connected to operating means (drive cables 12). In the case of known tilt-and-slide roofs (spoiler roofs) an opening width of a maximum of two thirds of the panel length can be obtained because of the coupling of the operating members in the front third of the panel. In comparison, the device according to the invention makes possible a stable panel guide even when the opening width is increased. For this purpose, there are provided at least two sliding elements (2, 5, 9) which are guided displaceably in the guide rails and of which at least two are provided with locking parts (20, 14, 18) for producing temporary locking to cutouts (28, 31, 19) on the guide rail (1) or for at least indirect locking to the drive carriage (13). Furthermore, coupled to one of the sliding elements (9) is a guide member (rod 10) on which the panel (27) is guided displaceably.

A system for closing or at least partially
opening a cover (27) of a tilting-sliding roof


with a drive slide (13) displaceably mounted on guide
rails (1) fixed to the roof and which is connected to a

push-out lever (3) for raising or lowering the cover (27)
and which is connected to actuating means, characterised in

that
the system comprises at least two sliding elements
(2,5,9) displaceably guided in the guide rails (1) and of

which at least two sliding elements (2,5,9) are provided
with interlocking parts (20,20A; 14,15,30; 18) for

establishing a temporary interlock with recesses (28,31,19)
on the guide rail (1) or an at least indirect interlock

with the drive slide (13) and
in that articulated on one of the sliding elements (9)
is a guide member (rod 10) on which the cover (27) is

displaceably guided.
A system according to Claim 1, characterised in
that when the cover (27) is closed, the sliding elements

(2,5,9) are disposed closely adjacent one another in the
front part of the guide rails (1).
A system according to one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the cover (27) is, close to

its front edge, pivotally connected to one of the sliding
elements (5).
A system according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the connection between the cover (27) and the sliding

element (5) is established by means of a lever (6). 
A system according to one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that two sliding elements (5,9)

which are at the front in the closed position at the cover
(27) are during a part of the displacement movement of the

cover coupled to each other by means of a bolt element (20)
and additionally to the drive slide (13).
A system according to Claim 5, characterised in
that prior to termination of the displacement movement of

the cover (27) in the opening direction, there is a
decoupling of the sliding elements (5,9) with a subsequent

interlocking of one sliding element (9) together with the
guide rail.
A system according to one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the push-out lever (3)

engages a connecting link (4), fixed to the roof, by means
of a pin (22).
A system according to Claim 7, characterised in
that the push-out lever (3) has its bottom end (35)

articulated on a sliding element (2) which at the start of
the displacement movement of the cover (27) in the opening

direction, is adapted to be coupled to the drive slide (13)
while its upper end (36) is pivotally and longitudinally

displaceably fixed to the guide member (10).
A system according to at least one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the system

comprises three sliding elements (2,5,9) of which

one rear sliding element (2) is connected to the
bottom end of the push-out lever (3) and, via an

interlocking part (20) and during the pushing out movement
of the cover (27), engages a recess (21) on the drive slide

(13) and during the final phases of the displacement 
movement of the cover (27), engages a recess (28) on the

guide rail (1),
a first front sliding element (9), on which a guide
member (10) for the cover (27) is articulated, and a second

front sliding element (5) are, during the pushing out
movement of the cover (27), and by means of a bolt element

(18) disposed on one of the sliding elements (5), engaged
in a recess (19) on the guide rail (1), furthermore, during

this pushing out phase and a first part of the displacement
movement of the cover (27), are coupled to one another by

means of a bolt element (14) and to a further bolt element
(40) with the drive slide (13),
the first front sliding element (9) is, during the
final phase of the displacement movement of the cover (27),

disengaged from the second, front sliding element (5) and is
at the same time locked by means of the bolt element (14)

to a recess (31) in the guide rail (1), the second sliding
element (5) which is coupled to a part (7) fixed to the

roof remains coupled to the drive slide (13).
