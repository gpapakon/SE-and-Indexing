<ABSTRACT>
A shooting weapon which is operated by compressed gas has a housing (1) and an antechamber (6) to which the compressed gas is supplied from a pressure container (5) which is fitted to the weapon such that it can be removed. In order to enable safe (reliable) operation at high pressure even in the case of a removable pressure container, and to ensure that the antechamber is automatically emptied, with minimal complexity, when the pressure container is removed, a valve unit (20) is provided in the weapon housing (1), between the pressure container (5) and the antechamber (6). This valve unit (20) has a pressure reducing device (31) and an adjusting screw (50) (which has an axial hole (51) and is fitted on the high-pressure side) in a valve housing (21, 22), the pressure reducing device (31) and the adjusting screw (50) having interacting sealing surfaces (52, 53) facing one another.

Gas operated shooting arm with a casing (1) containing an 
antechamber (6) supplied with pressurized gas from a pressurized 

gas container (5) removably attached to the arm, a valve 
unit (20) being arranged in the casing (1) between the pressurized 

gas container (5) and the antechamber (6), the valve unit 
comprising a valve housing (21,22) and therein a pressure reducer 

(31) and, on the high pressure side, an adjusting screw 
(50) with an axial bore (51), a pressure reducer (31) and an 

adjusting screw (50) having two cooperating sealing surfaces 
(52,53) facing each other, 
caracterized
 in that the pressurized 
gas container side of the adjusting screw (50) is shaped as a 

piston sealed with regard to its socket (24), and upon removing 
the pressurized gas container (5), the sealing surface (52) is 

lifted from the sealing surface (53) by shifting of the adjusting 
screw (50) through the axial play of the thread (62), 

whereby the antechamber (6) is automatically depressurized. 
Shooting arm according to claim 1, 
caracterized
 in that 
the valve housing (21,22) comprises the socket for the 

pressurized gas container (5) and is insertable into the casing 
of the arm. 
Shooting arm according to claim 1, 
caracterized
 in"that 
the pressure reducer (31) is a spring-loaded differential 

piston (28) coaxial with the adjusting screw (50). 
Shooting arm according to claim 1, 
caracterized
 in that 
the adjusting screw (50) is covered by a safety plate (56) on 

the high pressure side.
