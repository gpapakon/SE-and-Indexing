<ABSTRACT>
The object is to prepare a high-molecular-weight polyester in such a way that it is advantageously possible to produce even relatively small amounts of very high molecular weight in a very short time. This is achieved by the preparation of a polyester having an alkenediol content by continuing the polycondensation step to a viscosity number of from 50 to 140 cm
<
3
>
/g and subsequently subjecting the resultant polyester to solid phase postcondensation until the requisite viscosity number has been reached. The novel process enables high-molecular-weight polyesters having the desired property profile to be obtained.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a high-molecular-weight
polyester by reacting an aromatic dicarboxylic acid

with a mixture of alkane- and alkene-diols with
substantial exclusion of oxygen and in the presence of

a catalyst,

characterized in that the polycondensation step is
continued until a viscosity number in the range from

50 to 140 cm
3
/g is reached and the polyester thus
obtained is subsequently subjected to a solid-phase

postcondensation until the required viscosity number
is reached.

characterized in that the solid-phase postcondensation
is carried out at a temperature which is from 5 to

60°C below the melting point of the polyester.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that in the solid-phase

postcondensation a free-radical former is additionally
used in an amount in the range from 0.001 to 8% by

weight.
