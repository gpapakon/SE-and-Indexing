<CLAIMS>
The use of polyaspartic acid and condensates 
which contain at least 60 mol% of aspartic acid and up to 

40 mol% of other amino acids as condensed units, and of 
the alkali metal and ammonium salts of polyaspartic acid 

and of the said condensates to prevent deposits in the 
evaporation of sugar juices. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein poly-L-aspartic 
acid or condensates obtainable by condensation 

of L-aspartic acid with other amino acids are employed. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
condensates of D- or DL-aspartic acid are employed. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
condensates obtainable by elimination of water from 

crystalline L-aspartic acid at from 180 to 260°C are 
employed. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
condensates obtainable by elimination of water from L-aspartic 

acids in phosphoric acid medium at 120 to 250°C 
are employed.
