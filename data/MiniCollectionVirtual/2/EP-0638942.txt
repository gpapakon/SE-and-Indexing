cable, manufacturing method thereof, an oxide 

superconducting coil and a cable conductor which have high 
operational frequency are provided. The wire is a tape-like 

oxide superconducting wire including a plurality of

(2), and each filament (1) is twisted spirally along the 
longitudinal direction of the tape wire. By winding the 

wire in a coil, an oxide superconducting coil is obtained. 
When a plurality of such wires are collected, an oxide 

superconducting cable conductor can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superconducting
wire and manufacturing method thereof, as well as to an
oxide superconducting coil and a cable conductor. More
specifically, the present invention relates to an oxide
superconducting wire, manufacturing method thereof, an
oxide superconducting coil and a cable conductor having
high critical current density and low a.c. loss.In recent years, superconducting materials of
ceramics, i.e., oxide superconducting materials, are
watched with interest due to higher critical temperatures
thereof. Among these materials, yttrium, bismuth and
thallium oxide superconducting materials which exhibit
high critical temperatures of about 90K, 110K and 120K
respectively, are expected for practical application.A single-filamentary oxide superconducting wire
having high critical current density formed of such oxide
superconducting materials is obtained by heat treating and
then covering with a metal sheath the material powder,
drawing, rolling and by further heat treatment. 
Similarly, an oxide superconducting multi-filamentary wire
having high critical current density is obtained by heat
treating powder mainly consisting of oxide superconducting
material, then covering the same with a metal sheath,
drawing and putting together the as-obtained wires to
provide a multi-filamentary wire, and further by drawing,
rolling and heat treating the same.It has been conventionally known that an oxide
superconducting wire having higher critical current
density can be obtained by repeating several times the
steps of rolling and heat treatment in manufacturing such
an oxide superconducting wire.If such an oxide superconducting wire is to be
applied to an a.c. cable or magnet, it must have low a.c.
loss, high strength and superior property under bending-strain,
in addition to the high critical current.The single-filamentary and the multi-filamentary
oxide superconducting wires manufactured through the
conventional method described above have as high a
critical density as 30000A/cm2 or higher.However when an a.c. current is applied with the wire
wound in a coil, there is generated an a.c. loss heat
radiation. This is because an induced current flows
between the metal sheath and the ceramics when an a.c.
current is applied, resulting in heat radiation caused by 
a.c. loss of normal conduction resistance of the metal
sheath, as compared to the case when a d.c. current is
applied, in which case current flows only through the
ceramic portions. Since the temperature of the coil as a
whole
