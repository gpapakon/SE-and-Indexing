<ABSTRACT>
The electron beam drawing apparatus includes an 
exposure beam generation device and a workpiece 

installment device relatively movable in a first direction 
(Y) along a drawing plane of a workpiece, a second 

direction (X) perpendicular to the first direction, and a 
rotating direction along the drawing plane. Therefore, a 

pattern rotated by an arbitrary angle which is likely to 
be used in a large number in the next generation memory 

devices can be precisely drawn at high speed, in addition 
high flexibility is provided for the rotating angle and 

size of a figure, and an electron beam drawing apparatus 
which can minimize the amount of drawing data and a method

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron
beam drawing apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method of drawing
with an electron beam drawing apparatus according to the preamble of claim 6. More specifically, the invention improves the
structure of an electron beam drawing apparatus of variable formation type
and a method of drawing with
such an apparatus.An electron beam exposure apparatus and method according
to the preambles of claims 1 and 6 is known
from US 5 175 435.Today, prevailing among electron beam exposure
apparatuses are electron beam drawing apparatuses of
variable formation type which permit high speed drawing.
Particularly in the field of electron beam drawing
intended to directly form LSI patterns with electron
beams, drawing by means of variable formation method is
most popular. Electron beam drawing apparatuses employing
variable formation methods for producing photomasks or X
ray masks for semiconductor process are also paid much
attention.Now, the structure of such an electron beam drawing
apparatus will be described in conjunction with Fig. 13.In electron beam drawing apparatus 100, pattern data 
produced with a CAD machine 102 for example is transferred
to a magnetic disk device 108 from a control calculator
110 through a magnetic tape device 104 or a network 106.
Then, the pattern data is read from magnetic disk device
108 into control calculator 110 in which control signals
for determining the size, position, and time of
irradiation of an electron beam are calculated, and these
signals are transferred to an electron irradiation system
114 through a control interface 112.Based on the pattern data, an electron beam
irradiated from an electron gun 118 is converged by
electromagnetic lenses 120 and 122. The converged
electron beam forms an image on a substrate 126 to be
drawn on an X-Y stage 134. The electron beam is deflected
according to the pattern data, and turned on/off, and a
prescribed pattern is thus drawn on substrate 126.Meanwhile, since the range of deflection of an
electron beam is small, substrate 126 is moved in the X
and Y directions by X-Y stage 134, in order to subject the
entire surface of substrate 126 to drawing. The position
of X-Y stage 134 is always measured with a laser
interferometer 128, an error from a set value is fed back
to a drive motor 130 and a deflection electrode 124, and
the electron beam is accurately positioned. Note that an
auto loader 132 is placed in the vicinity of X-Y stage 
134, and automatically leads in and out substrate
