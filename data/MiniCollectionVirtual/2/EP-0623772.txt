<ABSTRACT>
Solenoid valve comprising a magnet coil (2) which is arranged in a housing (1), is of ring-shaped design and surrounds a metallic magnet armature (3) which can be moved backwards and forwards in the axial direction of the magnet coil (2), the magnet armature (3) being provided at the end (5) facing the valve seat (4) with a sealing body (6) made of elastomeric material. The magnet armature (3) and the sealing body (6) are connected positively to one another.

An electromagnetically actuable valve
comprising a magnet coil (2) of annular design, which

is arranged in a housing (1) and surrounds a magnet
armature (3) of metallic material which can be moved

backwards and forwards in the axial direction of the
magnet coil (2), the magnet armature (3) being

provided, on the end (5) facing the valve seat (4),
with a sealing body (6) of elastomeric material and

being penetrated by an aperture (9) which extends in
the direction of movement (8) and is completely filled

by the elastomeric material of the sealing body (6),
and the magnet armature (3) having on its end (5) a

groove-shaped undercut (7) which extends around the
outer periphery, and the undercut (7) and the sealing

body (6) being in engagement, characterized in that the
cross section of the aperture (9) widens conically from

that end (5) of the magnet armature (3) which faces the
valve seat (4).
A valve according to claim 1, characterized in
that the elastomeric material forms a stop buffer (17)

on that end (10) of the magnet armature (3) which faces
away from the sealing body (6).
A valve according to either of claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that, in the region of the aperture

(9), the magnet armature (3) is provided with
depressions which have a depth of 0.5 to 3.0 mm. 
A valve according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the elastomeric material of the

sealing body (9) has a Shore A hardness of 40 to 100.
A valve according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the surface bounding the aperture

(9) encloses an angle of 5° to 30° with the axis of the
magnet armature.
