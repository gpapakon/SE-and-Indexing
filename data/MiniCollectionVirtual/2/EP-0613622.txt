Method of manufacturing a non-alcohol drink

with a plant juice content between 20 and 100% by weight, preferably between
40 and 100% by weight,
with a pH value between 2.8 and 5.2,
with a total extract between 2 and 16 g/100 g, preferably between 4 and
16 g/100 g, and
with a ratio of total extract, expressed in g/100 g, to total acid, calculated as
g/100 g citric acid, from 5 to 50, where
the drink does not exceed a content of 1.2 mg/l in free hydroxycinnamic acids
and 0.2 mg/l of simple vinyl phenols, calculated as p-vinyl guaiacol after storage

for twelve months at 20 °C,
and with reduced sensory off-flavour components and, by this means, improved
storage stability with substantial retention of the other properties and content

materials of the drink

characterised in that

simple phenolic compounds, acting as compounds causing sensory off-flavour
components during storage, are removed or converted selectively during or alter

manufacture by selectively removing, by appropriate separating methods,
hydroxycinnamic acids (as the precursors of these compounds) dissolved in the drink

and/or selectively converting them by enzymes and/or micro-organisms and/or
additives.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that organic sulphur compounds, acting
as reducing agents, are added before the removal or conversion of the precursors.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the selective removal or
conversion of the compounds causing the sensory off-flavour components during

storage takes place by means of a packing material for storing a non-alcoholic drink

and/or by additives which are added to the drink before filling and storage.
Non-alcoholic drink as defined in the preamble to Claim 1,

characterised in that

it can be obtained by means of a method according to one of Claims 1 to 3.
Non-alcoholic drink according to Claim 4, characterised in that it is manufactured from
fruit juice and/or fruit pulp, fruit juice concentrate and/or fruit pulp concentrate,

vegetable juice and/or vegetable pulp and/or vegetable juice concentrate individually or
in combination.
Non-alcoholic drink according to Claim 4 or 5 in concentrated form, characterised in
that the total extract content is 40-88 g/100 g.
Non-alcoholic drink according to one of Claims 4 to 6, characterised in that citrus
juices such as orange juice and grapefruit juice and/or concentrated orange juice and

grapefruit juice are used as the initial material.
Non-alcoholic drink according to one of Claims 4 to 7, characterised in that
pomaceous fruit juices, drupaceous fruit juices and/or soft-fruit juices and/or

concentrates are used.
Non-alcoholic drink according to one of Claims 4 to 8, characterised in that in the
product ready for drinking, the content of free hydroxycinnamic acid does not exceed

0.6 mg/l and the content of simple vinyl phenols, calculated as p-vinyl guaiacol, does
not exceed 0.05 mg/l after storage for a period of twelve months at 20 °C. 
Non-alcoholic drink, preferably manufactured from citrus fruits, in accordance with
Claims 4 to 9, characterised in that in the product ready for drinking, the content of

5-hydroxy-2-methyl furfural does not exceed 0.5 mg/l after storage for a period of
twelve months at 20 °C.
