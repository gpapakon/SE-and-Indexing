<ABSTRACT>
A valve control device is described, of the type used in ABS or ASR systems in motor vehicles. Such a valve control device comprises a valve block accommodating the solenoid valves, a solenoid coil being assigned to each solenoid valve. That side of a solenoid coil holder facing the valve block has wells for accommodation of the solenoid coils, an elastic spring element being arranged on the bottoms of the wells, which presses the solenoid coil against the valve block. In addition each solenoid coil has first means, which interact as snap locking with second means, which are assigned to the well, when the solenoid coil is introduced into the said well so as to prevent the solenoid coil from being drawn out of the said well. At the same time the first and second means are of elastic design such that the solenoid coil, in the plane perpendicular to its coil axis, remains slightly displaceable in all directions.

<CLAIMS>
Valve control device (1) for controlling a
hydraulic/pneumatic system with several magnetic valves

disposed in a valve block (2), to which magnetic valves a
respective magnet coil (3) is allocated, which are

arranged in a coil holder (4), characterised by the
following features:


a) a circuit board (6) is provided, which is arranged on the
side of the coil holder (4) facing away from the valve

block (2) and accommodates a control electronics unit,
b) the side of the coil holder (4) facing the valve block (2)
has coil slots (5) to receive the magnet coils (3) which

have a depth approximately corresponding to the length of
the magnet coils (3),
c) an elastic spring element (8), which presses the magnet
coil (3) against the valve block (2), is arranged between

each magnet coil (3) and the associated coil slot base
(5a),
d) each magnet coil (3) has first means (9, 9a, 9b), which
cooperate with second means (10) allocated to the coil

slot (5) when the magnet coil (3) is inserted into the
coil slot (5) in the form of a
 snap lock arrangement in
such a way as to prevent removal of the magnet coil (3)

from the coil slot (5), and
e) the first and second means (9, 9a, 9b, 10) are constructed
to be elastic so that the magnet coil (3) remains

displaceable to a slight degree in all directions in the
plane perpendicular to its coil axis (13).
Valve control device according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the connection wires (11) of the magnet coil (3)

are guided directly onto the circuit board (6).
Valve control device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the first means (9, 9a, 9b) comprise

several elastic holding fingers (9) fastened on one side
on the magnet coil (3), at the free ends of which a

respective detent (9a) is arranged which, upon insertion
of the magnet coil (3) into the coil slot (5), locks

resiliently into a groove (10) constructed as a second
means disposed on the periphery of the coil slot (5).
Valve control device according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the holding finger (9) is fastened on the face of

the magnet coil (3) facing the coil slot base (5) and has
a length corresponding approximately to half the length of

the magnet coil (3).
Use of a valve control device according to one of the
preceding claims for an ABS (anti-skid) and/or anti-slip

control system of a motor vehicle.
