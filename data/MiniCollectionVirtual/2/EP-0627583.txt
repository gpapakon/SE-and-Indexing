<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises a diaphragm valve for the 
control of fluid flow comprising a fluid inlet means (8); 

a fluid outlet means (9); a fluid path means defining a 
fluid flow path through said valve between the inlet and 

outlet; a flexible diaphragm means (6) juxtaposed said 
fluid flow path; valve seat means (12); and means (4) for 

flexing said diaphragm means into contact with said seat 
means thereby to reduce or stop the flow of fluid in said 

path; characterised in that said seat means (12) is 
removable for ease of maintenance or replacement; said 

seat means may, in some embodiments, be carried by a 
removable seat carrier (7) within a valve cavity(2) 

formed in a valve body (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diaphragm valve, and
has particular reference to a diaphragm valve of the type
comprising a fluid inlet means, a fluid outlet means,
fluid path means defining a path for fluid flow between
the inlet and the outlet, a flexible diaphragm means
juxtaposed said path, a valve seat means, and means for
flexing the diaphragm means into contact with the valve
seat to reduce or stop the flow of fluid in the path in
service.In prior art diaphragm valves of the kind described
above, the seat means is typically formed integrally with
a wall of a valve body circumjacent the inlet means.
When the valve seat means becomes damaged or worn in
service it is therefore difficult to repair or replace
the seat, and replacement of the whole valve is usually
necessary.US-A-4,471,510 discloses a diaphragm valve which has a
valve insert carrying a valve seat. The insert may be
exchanged with other inserts to tailor the throttle
effect of the valve to fluid flow.DE-C-1,152,583 discloses a diaphragm valve provided with
a valve seat integral with a carrier ring, which carrier 
ring is formed with an inlet passage and a plurality of
outlet passages.GB-A-320,778 discloses a diaphragm valve provided with
a valve seat carried by a carrier ring, which carrier
ring is formed with an inlet passage and a plurality of
outlet passages.According to the present invention there is provided a
diaphragm valve for the control of fluid flow
comprising:-
a valve body in which defines a valve cavity, a
wall of which body is provided with fluid inlet
means and fluid outlet means;flexible diaphragm means juxtaposed a fluid flow
path between the inlet and the outlet; a removable carrier ring disposed in juxtaposition
with the wall of said body and provided with a
central hole in fluid communication with the inlet
means; valve seat means disposed circumjacent one end of
the central hole; and means for flexing said diaphragm means into contact
with said seat means thereby to reduce or stop the
flow of fluid in said path, 
characterised by a first spacing ring circumjacent the
other end of the central hole and a second spacing ring 
juxtaposed the periphery of the ring, which first and
second spacing rings are disposed intermediate the wall
and the carrier ring and configured such that when the
first spacing ring abuts the wall the second spacing ring
is spaced slightly from the wall. Means may be provided
to press the peripheral edge of the carrier ring against
the wall thereby to bend the carrier ring. In this way
the

A diaphragm valve for the control of fluid flow
comprising:-


a valve body in which defines a valve cavity, a
wall (2a) of which body is provided with fluid

inlet means (8a) and fluid outlet means (9a);
flexible diaphragm means (6) juxtaposed a fluid

flow path between the inlet and the outlet;
a removable carrier ring (7) disposed in
juxtaposition with the wall (2a) of said body and

provided with a central hole (10) in fluid
communication with the inlet means;
valve seat means (12) disposed circumjacent one end
of the central hole (10); and
means for flexing said diaphragm means into contact
with said seat means thereby to reduce or stop the

flow of fluid in said path,

characterised by a first spacing ring (15) circumjacent
the other end of the central hole (10) and a second

spacing ring (16) juxtaposed the periphery of the carrier
ring, which first and second spacing rings are disposed

intermediate the wall and the carrier ring and configured
such that when the first spacing ring abuts the wall (2a)

the second spacing ring is spaced slightly (h) from the
wall.
A valve as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that
means (5) are provided to press the peripheral edge of

the carrier ring against the wall thereby to bend the
carrier ring.
A valve as claimed in claim 1 on claim 2 wherein the
first spacing ring (15) projects by about 0.05mm further

than spacing ring (16). 
A valve as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims 1 wherein the valve seat means (12) comprises a

seat ring disposed in a recess (14) formed in said
carrier ring circumjacent the central hole.
A valve as claimed in claim 4 wherein said seat ring
(12) is formed from a synthetic material.
A valve as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein said seat means is formed integral with said

carrier.
A valve as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims wherein said diaphragm means (6) is retained in

abutment with the carrier ring (7) and juxtaposed the
periphery of the latter by diaphragm retaining means (5);

and wherein said diaphragm (6) is shaped such that it is
spaced from said central and additional holes.
A valve as claimed in claim 7 wherein said carrier

ring (7) can be urged against the wall (2a) by said
diaphragm retaining means (5).
A valve as claimed any preceding claim wherein said
first and second spacing rings (15,16) are formed

integrally with said carrier ring (7). 
A valve as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8
wherein said second spacing ring (16) is formed from a

synthetic resin material and is disposed in a recess (17)
formed in the carrier ring.
A valve as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the diaphragm means comprises a

diaphragm (6) formed of a thin metal plate.
