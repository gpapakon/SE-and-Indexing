<ABSTRACT>
In an optical disk having a recording plane having a 
spiral first track and a spiral second track, information 

being to be recorded into and/or reproduced from said first 
and second tracks, the first track is formed into a 

groove-like shape, the second track is formed between 
adjacent the first tracks and into a land-like shape, and 

the first and second tracks record informations in different 
modulation methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high density optical disk and to a method of tracking such disk,
as set forth in the preamble of claim 1. A disk of this kind is known from US 5,199,022.This document describes an optical disk with a land and a groove track wherein the
address is divided into a high and a low address group for distinguishing the tracks from
each other. The address group is evaluated in a land or groove tracking control.US 5,185,730 discloses an optical disk and a method for writing data to and reading data
from said disk that has address information written on a land disposed between grooves or
in its pre-grooves. Because data is written to and read from the pregrooves or land where
no address is written, continuous signals can be written to and read from the disk without
format change. The pregrooves guide the beam spot for writing and reading data, the
pregrooves flanking the land containing address information. The method involves
generating a control signal for controlling the polarity and level of the direction and amount
of deviation of the beam spot directed at the land (or pregrooves). In accordance with the
control signal, the beam spot is made to follow the land (or pregrooves) while reading
address information therefrom.Capacities of typical optical disks are as follows: when an optical head of a lens NA of 0.5
is used, a 130-mm disk has a capacity of 300 to 500 MB per face, and a 90-mm disk has a
capacity of about 128 to 250 MB per face. For multimedia purpose, a high density
recording/reproduction technique which uses a short-wavelength 
laser of 680 nm to obtain a capacity that is
about 2 to 4 times the above-mentioned capacities has been
studied.Fig. 10 shows plan views (upper ones) and section views
(lower ones) of continuous servo track formats in the prior
art.Fig. 10(a) shows a continuous servo track which is
employed in a 130-mm or 90-mm optical disk of the prior art
and which is of a land record track format. In the land
record track format, a track consists of a groove 2 which is
formed on a transparent substrate 1 and which has a depth of
λ/(8·n) (λ is the wavelength of a laser, and n is the
refractive index of the substrate 1. The same applies to
the followings.), and pits 4 constituting a sector
identification (ID) signal, and record marks 5 are recorded
onto a land 3 sandwiched by the tracks. The pits 4 for the
ID signal are convex-concave pits having a phase depth of
λ/(4·n).The track pitch is selected so as to be about λ/NA
which is obtained from the laser
