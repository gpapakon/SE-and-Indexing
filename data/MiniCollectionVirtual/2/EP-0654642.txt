<ABSTRACT>
A stiff and self-supporting insulation panel for cooling devices consists of a multiplicity of closed air chambers in a honeycomb construction. The insulation panel is produced from cardboard material. The insulation capability is increased by means of a reflector film which preferably consists of aluminium and with which the covering layer is covered on its outer side.

Insulating plate for cooling equipment with a
large number of air chambers (11), running

perpendicular to the exterior surface, which are
closed at the front with a top coating (2),

characterised by the fact that the insulating
plate is made of a honeycomb coating which is

made in connected strips wherein the honeycomb
coating has large volume air chambers (11)

relative to the material used for it, and these
air chambers have a symmetrical shape so that the

insulating plate has almost identical stability
properties in both the lateral and longitudinal

directions.
Insulating plate as described in claim 1,
characterised by the fact that the air chambers

(11) take the shape of bee-type honeycombs.
Insulating plate as described in claim 1,
characterised by the fact that the air chambers

(11) are square.
Insulating plate as described in one of claims 1
to 3, characterised by the fact that the

honeycomb coating (1) and the two cover coatings
(2) are made of cardboard material.
Insulating plate as described in claim 4,
characterised by the fact that the cardboard

material for the top coatings (2) is rigid
cardboard.
Insulating plate as described in one or more of
claims 1 to 5, characterised by the fact that the

top coatings (2) are coated with a reflective
coating (3) on their outside.
Insulating plate as described in claim 6,
characterised by the fact that the reflective

coating (3) consists of two aluminium foils (31,
32), between which there is a texture grid (4). 
Insulating plate as described in claims 1 to 7,
characterised by the fact that the top coating

(3) has an extension (31) which is drawn under
the side areas of the insulating plate.
Insulating plate as described in one or more of
claims 6 to 9, characterised by the fact that the

reflective coating (3) is drawn under the side
area of the insulating plate with an extension

(33).
Process for the production of an insulating plate
as described in claims 6 to 9, characterised by

the fact that an adhesive foil is affixed to the
top coating (2) on to which a foil (31) is

affixed to act as the reflective coating (3).
Process for the production of an insulating plate
as described in claim 10, characterised by the

fact that a textured grid (4) is then affixed to
the reflective foil (31) and a further reflective

foil (32) is then affixed to the textured grid
(4).
Process for the production of an insulating plate
as described in claims 6 to 9, characterised by

the fact that on a reflective foil (31) a
textured grid (4) is affixed which is covered by

a second reflective foil (32), wherein both foils
(31, 32) are glued to each other and the

reflective coating (3) thus produced is applied
to the cover coating (2).
Process for the production of an insulating plate
as described in claims 6 to 9, characterised by

the fact that a textured grid (4) is affixed
straight on to the top coating (2) and then

covered with a reflective foil (32).
Process for the production of an insulating plate
as described in claims 6 to 9, characterised by

the fact that a textured grid (4) is drawn over a
reflective foil (31) and the reflective coating

(3) thus produced is affixed to the top coating
(2) so that the textured grid (4) rests

immediately on the top coating (2).
Process for the production of an insulating plate
as described in one or more of claims 6 to 9,

characterised by the fact that the reflective
coating (3) which reinforces the top coatings (2)

is affixed by means of an adhesive which allows
the reflective coating (3) to be removed for

subsequent disposal.
