<ABSTRACT>
Optical fibre elements, such as narrow pass-band filters, dispersion 
equalisers, and channel dropping filters, are constructed from 2 x 2 

single mode optical fibre fused tapered couplers having formed on 
one side of coupling regions (34, 36, 35) Bragg distributed gratings 

(37) in the two fibres (30, 31) from which the coupler is constructed. 
By making the gratings at a point where the fibres remain fused 

together in side-by-side contact it is ensured that they lie equidistant 
from the coupling region.

<DESCRIPTION>
A known single mode optical fibre component is the optical fibre
Bragg distributed grating. Such a component is useful as an optical
filter which can readily be made in a form that is both relatively
highly wavelength selective and polarisation state insensitive.One method by which such a grating can be made is described in
GB 2 161 612A, and involves launching a high-power beam of light
into a length of photo-responsive single mode fibre and using a
reflector to set up a standing-wave pattern in the fibre. This
standing-wave pattem produces localised changes in the refractive
index of the fibre resulting in the production of a narrow stop-band
filter that is selectively reflective at the wavelength of light employed
to make the grating. Another method by which such a grating can
be written is described by G Meltz et al in article entitled:
"Formation of Bragg Gratings in Optical Fibres by Transverse
Holographic Method", Optics Letters, 1989, 14, (15), pp 823-825.
This involves illuminating the fibre from the side with a
holographically generated grating fringe pattern. When such fringe
pattems are generated with interfering beams of collimated light, the
resulting grating is of uniform pitch, though chirped gratings can
also be generated by the expedient of using interfering beams of
differing divergence.Both types of method of making distributed Bragg gratings so far
described have involved the use of light to create a phase grating in
the fibre. A different type of grating, known as a type II grating, is 
similarly made in single mode optical fibre by lateral holographic
illumination, but in this instance the grating fringe pattem is formed
much more rapidly, typically using a single short duration pulse from
an excimer laser. The creation of such type II gratings is for
instance described by C G Askins et al in an article entitled: "Fibre
Bragg Reflectors Prepared by a Single Excimer Pulse", Optics
letters, 1992, 17 (15) pp 833-835.Another known single mode optical fibre component is the 2x2
single mode optical fibre fused tapered coupler. This may be
produced in a highly reproducible manner by a progressive
stretching method substantially as described in GB 2 150 703A.
The essence of this progressive stretching method of making such a
coupler is that two substantially identical optical fibres are stranded
together and mounted between a pair of clamps that themselves are
mounted on independent motor-driven linearly sliding carriages.
The two sliding carriages move along a common axis, and the

An optical fibre element incorporating a 2 x 2 single mode
tapered fused fibre coupler structure formed from two single mode

optical fibres (30,31) of substantially identical cross-section secured
together in side-by-side contact over a length that includes

sequentially a first portion where the fibres are drawn down to an
extent providing a coupling region (36) in which there is mutual

optical coupling between the two fibres, and a second portion in
which there is substantially no mutual coupling between the fibres,

and characterised in that in said second portion equidistant from
said coupling region (36) is formed a pair of substantially identical

Bragg distributed gratings (37), one member of the pair of gratings
being formed in each of the two fibres.

said uniform pitch gratings (37) are present in tapered regions (47)

of said fibres.
An optical fibre element as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein said length includes sequentially said first portion, next said

second portion, and then a third portion where the fibres are drawn
down to an extent providing a further coupling region (56) in which

there is mutual optical coupling between the two fibres (30, 31), and
wherein said Bragg distributed gratings are equidistant from said

further coupling region.

in which method the two fibres are fused together in side-by-side
