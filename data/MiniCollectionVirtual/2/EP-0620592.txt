<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an integrated
circuit package in which an integrated circuit chip is
enclosed in a package body in an airtight manner, and
more particularly to improvements in the heat radiation
characteristics of such an integrated circuit package.In recent years, portable electronic apparatus
such as lap-top personal computers, have appeared on
the market. Electronic apparatus of this type require
electronics which are miniaturized and have a high
reliability. In order to achieve a high performance
thereof, it is necessary to use one or more integrated
circuit chips. Such integrated circuit chips generate
a great amount of heat and therefore integrated circuit
packages having high heat radiation properties are
demanded.Conventionally, the heat radiation properties of
an integrated circuit package are improved by closely
contacting the integrated circuit package with a
separate heat sink. However, heat resistance arises
from the contact between the integrated circuit package
and the heat sink and there is a limitation to the
improvement in heat radiation properties of the
integrated circuit package that can be made.EP-A-0614330 which forms the state of the art according to Article 54(3) EPC, discloses an integrated circuit
package in which an integrated circuit chip is enclosed
within a package body. Adhered to the package body is
a heat sink with fins for radiating heat produced by
the integrated circuit chip.Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an
integrated circuit package which has superior heat
radiation properties.According to the present invention, there is
provided an integrated circuit package comprising:
a package body;  an integrated circuit chip enclosed airtightly
within the package body; anda lead provided at a lower portion of the package
body for connecting said integrated circuit chip to an
external circuit;the package body having, at an upper portion
thereof, a heat radiation region, comprising heat
radiation fins integral with the package body, and an
air blowing region in which means for blowing air for cooling the package body,
is disposed, a ventilation flue being formed between
the heat radiation region and the air blowing region.Preferably, the means for blowing air comprises a
fan assembly which includes a motor having a rotary
shaft extending in a direction perpendicular to the
plane of the package body, fan blades connected to the
rotary shaft, and a driver circuit section for driving
the motor.The integrated circuit package may further
comprise a cover
