<ABSTRACT>
A device for showing the operation conditions of the failures 
in a burner comprising, in combination: an instrument 

for counting and visualizing the time (10) beginning from 
the moment in which the control and monitoring instrumentation 

gives the consent to start to the burner; a plurality 
of pilot lights (1-6), each of them indicating at least: 

the presence or the absence of the mains voltage (1); the 
operation or the failure of the burner motor (2); the 

operation or the failure of the burner (3); the operation 
or the failure of the first fuel valve of the burner (5); the 

operation or the failure of an eventual second fuel valve 
of the burner (4); the waiting condition or the failure of 

the control and monitoring instrumentation of the burner 
(6). According to a preferred embodiment the instrument for 

the time counting is a microprocessor (24) able to repeat 
the count at each consent to start given to the burner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for showing the operation 
conditions and the failures in a burner burning fuel of 
any kind. It is a known fact that each burner is equipped with devices 
for controlling and monitoring its operation which, 
besides controlling the sequence of the various operation 
phases of the burner, interrupt the operation in the presence 
of anomalous conditions. More in particular, the majority of the burners are equipped 
with monitoring boxes commonly called "control box" 
in which the control and monitoring circuits usually signal 
only the eventual failure of the burner with a proper 
luminous device. Any type of burner in the market is equipped with monitors 
suitable for its functional requirements in the respect of 
the international safety rules. At present the monitoring and safety devices foreseen by 
such rules are provided only with the luminous signal in 
case of a performance failure, but they present an important 
limit in that most of them do not make evident the 
instant or the cycle phase in which the failure has occurred. 
This fact is not of minor importance since the operation 
sequences, typical of each control and monitoring 
device of the burner, would permit to diagnose exactly the 
cause of the failure if it were possible to know the instant 
or the period in which said failure has occurred and, 
therefore, it would be possible to make some target interventions 
which would save time, as a consequence. The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the 
limits now mentioned. In particular, the main purpose is that of obtaining a 
device for showing the operation conditions and the failures 
in a burner, which combines the signaling of the  
 
failure with the signaling of the time when said failure 
has occurred. Another purpose of the present invention is that of obtaining 
the device according to the invention insertable in 
any burner, so that said device works in addition to the 
already existing device and is compatible with the same. Finally, another purpose is that of obtaining the device 
according to the invention at low costs and make it easy to 
connect with the control and monitoring devices already 
present in the burners, without the external circuits 
having to undergo any modifications. The above mentioned purposes and others which will be 
better pointed out hereinafter, are achieved by the device 
for showing the operation conditions and the failures in a 
burner which, in accordance with the invention, is characterized 
in that it

<CLAIMS>
A device for showing the operation conditions and 
the failures in a burner, characterized in that it comprises, 

in combination: 

an instrument for counting and visualizing the time (10) 
beginning from the moment in which the control and monitoring 

instrumentation gives the consent to the burner to 
start; 
a plurality of pilot lights (1-6) each of them indicating 
at least: 


the presence or the absence of the mains voltage (1), 
the operation or the failure of the burner engine (2), 
the operation or the failure of the burner (3), 
the operation or the failure of the first fuel valve of 
the burner (5), 
the operation or the failure of an eventual second fuel 
valve of the burner (4), 
the waiting condition or the failure of the control and 
monitoring instrumentation of the burner (6), 
 
said pilot lights being activated by electrical signals 

issuing from the control and monitoring instrumentation 
belonging to the burner. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the instrument for the time counting of the burner 

operation is a microprocessor (24) able to repeat the count 
at least at each consent to start given to the burner. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the microprocessor is provided with a counter suitable 

for storing the total operation time of the first stage of 
the burner flame and the total operation time of an eventual 

second stage of the burner flame.
