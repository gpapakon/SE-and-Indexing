<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a device for the height adjustment of a safety belt fitting in vehicles, a load-accommodating guide rail (10) which is set up for fastening to the vehicle has a plurality of locking elements (21) which are at a longitudinal distance from one another. A support (12) is displaceably accommodated in the guide rail (10) and has the safety belt fitting fastened to it. A bolt (22) which can be selectively engaged with the locking elements (21) is mounted on the support. Actuation of a release element (26) causes the bolt (22) to be released from the respective locking element (21). The bolt (22) is mounted on the support (12) so as to be pivotable about an at least approximately horizontal pivot axis (A) and its centre of gravity (S) is offset with respect to a plane (E), which passes through the pivot axis (A) and is parallel to the guide rail (10), to the side of the guide rail (10). If the support moves suddenly downwards owing to tightening of the belt, the bolt (22) is forcibly swung into its locking position under its own mass moment of inertia.

A device for height adjustment of a vehicular seat belt 
fitting including a load-bearing guide rail (10) equipped 

for securing to the vehicle, this guide rail having a plurality 
of latching members (21) spaced in its longitudinal 

direction and in which a carrier (12) is shiftably mounted, 
to which the seat belt fitting is secured, a latch (22) 

selectively latchable to the latching members (21), this 
latch being mounted on the carrier, and a release member 

(26) by the actuation of which the latch (22) is releasable 
from the corresponding latching member (21), characterized 

in that the latch (22) is mounted on the carrier (12) so 
that it can be swivelled about a swivel axis (A) which is at 

least more or less horizontal and its center of gravity (S) 
is displaced towards the side of the guide rail (10) relatively 

to a plane (E) oriented parallel to the guide rail 
(10) and passing through the swivel axis (A), in that the 

latch (22) is biased towards the latching members (21) by 
spring force (24), and in that the release member is formed 

by an actuating lever (26), swivably mounted on the carrier 
(12), which when actuated engages the latch (22) and under 

the effect of an acceleration, by means of which the latch 
is swivelled in the direction of the latching members (21), 

is released from the latch (22). 
A device as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
the latch (22) is swivably supported on the carrier (12) by 

its end facing away from the guide rail (10).  
 
A device as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2, characterized 
in that the latching members (21) protrude from the 

flat bottom wall of the guide rail (10) into the interior 
space thereof and in that the latch (22) is maintained in 

contact with the inner surface of the bottom wall of the 
guide rail (10) by the spring force (24). 
A device as set forth in any of the claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the latch (22) features a generally 

L-shaped part the free end of its long arm (22a) bearing on 
the carrier (12) and carrying at the end of its short arm 

(22b) formed curved towards the bottom of the guide rail 
(10) a latching projection (22c) curved slanting towards the 

bottom of the guide rail, at the free end of which a latching 
edge (22d) is formed.
