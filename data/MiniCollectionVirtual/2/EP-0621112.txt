<ABSTRACT>
An industrial robot having joints (10) 
each having in turn a joint driving motor (MR) 

and a reduction gear (40), wherein when a rotational 
input of said motor (MR) is inputted to 

said reduction gear (10) via transmission mechanisms 
(32, 34), an reduced output is transmitted 

to movable elements of said joint (10), 
wherein said reduction gear (10) has a hollow 

cylindrical area (16a) about its central axis (A), 
wherein void areas (16b, 16c) are formed at upper 

and lower portions of said reduction gear 
(10) without structural members and components 

of said robot being connected to each 
other, and wherein said hollow cylindrical area 

and said void areas (16a-16c) are used for wiring 
and piping passages of cables (50) and 

hoses (52), whereby said cables and hoses are 
allowed to pass along said central axis (A) of 

said joint (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure of a joint of 
an industrial robot, and more particularly, it relates to an 
industrial robot provided with a joint having at least one 
hollow reduction gear reducing an input speed to a lower speed 
and transmitting rotative motion and force from a joint drive 
motor to a movable element of the joint, the hollow reduction 
gear having a central hollow space therein, to be used as a 
piping and wiring space for laying power transmission cables 
for supplying power to the front elements of the robot, signal 
cables for transmitting electric signals, and pipes and hoses 
for supplying working fluids and assist gases, to thereby reduce 
torsion and extension of the cables, the pipes and hoses when 
the movable element of the joint is driven for turning motions 
and to expand the range of joint motion. An industrial robot, particularly, an industrial multi-joint 
or articulation type robot has a robot structure including a 
robot base, i.e., a base element, a revolving body supported 
upright on the robot base via a rotary joint, a robot arm 
articulated to the revolving body via joint for rotating actions, 
a robot wrist joined by a joint to the front end of the robot arm, 
and an end effector, such as a robot hand, held on the robot 
wrist via a joint. Therefore, motors, i.e., driving sources, for 
driving the revolving body, the robot arm, the robot wrist, the 
end effector and such, i.e., movable elements, signal cables for 
transmitting signals for controlling the operation of the 
movable elements, a pipe and a hose for supplying a working 
fluid, such as compressed air, for operating the end effector, 
and, if the industrial robot is a welding robot or the like, an 
assist gas supply hosepipe for supplying an assist gas for  
 
welding are arranged on the robot structure of this industrial 
robot. In such an industrial multi-articulated type robot, each of 
joints on which the revolving body, the robot arm and such is 
provided on its center axis with a drive unit formed by 
combining a drive motor and a reduction gear. Generally, wiring 
cables for supplying electric power to the drive motors, and 
hosepipes for supplying a working fluid, cooling water and an 
assist gas to the end effector are arranged mainly along the 
outer surface of the robot structure or extended on cable racks 
and pipe racks supported on the outer surface of the robot 
structure. Although there have been proposed technical ideas of 
forming the robot body in a hollow structure
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An industrial robot having at least one joint 
incorporating a hollow reduction gear therein to relatively 

rotatably join two structural elements of the industrial robot, 
comprising: 

   a drive motor; 
   a hollow reduction gear including an input element 

receiving input rotative force through at least one pair of gear
