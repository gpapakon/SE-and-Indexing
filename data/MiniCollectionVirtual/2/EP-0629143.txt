<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a filter element for 
the filtration of fluids, particularly for the 
filtration of air. Fluid or air filtering means are known in a wide 
variety of embodiments. Known filtering means comprise 
a frame or the like holding a filter element. The 
filter element is provided with a layer of filter 
material for filtration of the fluid or the air, i.e. 
for retaining the impurities conveyed in the fluid or 
the air stream which have to be filtered out. The 
materials for the filter material layer are nonwoven 
fiber layers, preferably electret materials, foamed 
plastics or other materials being permeable to the 
fluid or air to be cleaned. Often, the filter material 
layer also consists of paper. For enlarging the 
surface of the filter material layer, the filter 
material layer is folded to present a zig-zag shape 
when seen in cross section. If the material of the 
filter layer has no inherent shape stability, as is the 
case, e.g., with nonwoven materials, a support material 
layer for supporting the filter material layer is 
required in addition to the filter material layer 
itself. The support material layer, being a reticular 
support structure of metal or plastic, is permeable to 
the fluid or air and is connected to the filter 
material layer, e.g., by bonding. A decisive value for 
all fluid filter elements is the flow resistance caused 
by these filter elements in the flow to be cleaned. Besides providing zig-zag shaped layers of support 
material, tee state of the art offers many suggestions  
 
for mechanical stabilization the zig-zag shape of the 
filter material layer. In the filter elements 
according to DE 89 01 798.6 Ul and EP-A-0 383 236, the 
support material layer is of sufficient stability for 
preventing a widening and folding effect (ballooning 
and collapsing) of the individual folding portions of 
the zig-zag like folded filtering and support material 
layers. US-A- 3 506 457 teaches the connection of the 
zig-zag shaped filter material layer to a flat 
reticular support structure; in this prior art 
solution, the zig-zag shaped filter material layer is 
connected to the flat reticular support structure along 
each second bending line. Spacers arranged on the 
filter frame for providing and maintaining the zig-zag 
shape of the filter material layer are known, e.g., 
from EP-A-0 170 643. In other known filtering means, 
the filter frame has lateral webs or the like extending 
thereacross, with the filter material layer arranged in 
zig-zag shape between
