<ABSTRACT>
A curvilinear belt conveyor which can be used above ground in particular and can be operated at any length can be advantageously operated without supporting belt rollers, so that flexing work is unable to affect the belt. This results in long service lives and in addition operation which is steadier, more even and more reliable. It is driven either via a linear motor drive system which acts laterally on the belt and is composed of the magnets which are assigned to running wheel supports and of the stators which are fixedly integrated into the guiding channels or via a tension chain, for example, which runs in the guiding channels and is then correspondingly connected to the running wheel supports. The lateral edges of the belt are taken hold of via the running wheel supports or are connected to the latter in such a way that a slewing connection is achieved. The arrangement of the guiding channels gives the belt a predetermined sag which can therefore also be modified in accordance with requirements by modifying the arrangement of the guiding channels, virtually to the point at which the belt forms an enclosed tube.
