<ABSTRACT>
The lamp/reflector unit has an electric lamp (10) mounted in a reflector 
body (1) having a neck (4). A metal sleeve (20) is present around the neck. The sleeve 

has outward projections (21) to provide grip to retention means of a lamp holder, and 
inward projections (22) which engage grooves (6) present in the neck. The free-end 

portion (5) of the neck (4) extends beyond the sleeve (20). The unit is of a simple 
construction, which nevertheless provides for a rigid coupling of the sleeve (20) to the 

reflector body (1) even with large tolerances as to the size of the neck (4). The unit, 
moreover, obviates the risk of short-circuiting the contact elements of a lampholder by 

the metal sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a lamp/reflector unit comprising: 
a glass reflector body provided with a concave reflecting surface having 
an optical axis, and around the optical axis a neck with a free-end portion; an electric lamp with a lamp vessel which is sealed in a gastight manner 
and in which a electric element is arranged and connected to current conductors which 
issue to the exterior from a seal of the lamp vessel; a metal sleeve fastened around the neck of the reflector body, which 
sleeve has projections which face away from one another and extend transversely to the 
optical axis, the electric lamp being secured in the neck and the current conductors 
each projecting from the neck and the sleeve to the exterior with a respective free end 
so as to form contact pins. Such a lamp/reflector unit is known from EP 0 367 323-A2. The metal 
sleeve in this case has the object of providing the unit with a profiled outer surface at 
which a lampholder in which the unit is accommodated can grip the unit by means of 
resilient retention means. It is prevented thereby that a lampholder is capable of holding 
the unit by the contact pins only, which provides too uncertain a retention of the unit. GB 2 153 986-A discloses the provision of grooves in the neck of the 
reflector body, into which retention means can engage. A disadvantage of this is, 
however, that there is too wide a spread as regards the dimension of the neck in order 
to safeguard a good retention. The unit of the said EP 0 367 323-A2 has the advantage that the metal 
sleeve has the profile with which retention means can cooperate and that the sleeve can 
be readily manufactured with narrow dimensional tolerances. A disadvantage is, 
however, that the sleeve in the known unit is fixed around the neck with cement and 
that its mounting as a result is time-consuming and accordingly expensive. Cement does  
 
render it possible to fix the sleeve immovably around the neck in spite of the 
dimensional variations in the latter. In this unit, the metal sleeve forms a extension of 
the neck. A disadvantage of this is the risk that the sleeve short-circuits the contact 
members of a lampholder, which need not be recessed in the case of lampholders for 
low-voltage lamps. It is an object of the invention to provide a lamp/reflector unit of the kind 
mentioned in the opening paragraph which is of a reliable and simple construction 
which is easy to manufacture. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the metal sleeve 
has projections

<CLAIMS>
A lamp/reflector unit comprising: 

a glass reflector body (1) provided with a concave reflecting surface (2) 
having an optical axis (3), and around the optical axis a neck (4) with a free-end portion 

(5); 
an electric lamp (10) with a lamp vessel (11) which is sealed in a gastight 
manner and in which an electric element (12) is arranged and connected to current 

conductors (13) which issue to the exterior from a seal (14) of the lamp vessel; 
a metal sleeve (20) fastened around the neck (4) of the reflector body (1), 
which sleeve has projections (21) which face away from one another and extend 

transversely to the optical axis (3), 
the electric lamp (10) being secured in the neck (4) and the current 
conductors (13) each projecting from the neck (4) and the sleeve (20) to the exterior 

with a respective free end (15) so as to form contact pins, 
 
   characterized in that the metal sleeve (20) has projections (22) which face 

one another and which enter grooves (6) in the neck (4) of the reflector body (1), and in 
that the neck (4) projects with its free-end portion (5) to outside the sleeve (20) along the optical axis (3). 
A lamp/reflector unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the 
mutually facing projections (22) are farther removed from the free-end portion (5) than 

are the projections (21) facing away from one another. 
A lamp/reflector unit as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the 
sleeve (20) is made from metal plating and the mutually facing projections (22) are 

immediately adjacent each time to the projections (21) facing away from one another. 
A lamp/reflector unit as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that 
the sleeve (20) has a depression (23) which presses against the neck (4) of the reflector 

body (1).
