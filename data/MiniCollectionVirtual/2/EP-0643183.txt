<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for a catching hold (locking latch) between two parts rotatable relative to one another, particularly cylindrical parts of a lock which are arranged coaxially relative to one another, with a spring-loaded detent piece which is mounted in the first part and which, in the detaining position, projects into a recess of the second part, there being mounted in the detent piece at least one shaped piece which is moveable transversely relative to the direction of movement of the detent piece and is spring-loaded, the shaped piece bearing on a laterally arranged oblique face and/or edge for the purpose of generating the spring load on the detent piece.

<CLAIMS>
A device for a locking hold (arresting device) between 
two parts (1, 4) twistable relative to one another, in 

particular cylindrical parts of a lock disposed coaxially 
in relation to one another, having a spring-loaded 

locking piece (6), which is mounted in the first part (1) 
and in the locked position protrudes into a recess of the 

second part (4),
characterised in that
 at least one shaped part (10), 
which can move at right angles to the direction of 

movement of the locking piece (1) and is spring-loaded, 
is mounted in the locking piece, whereby to produce the 

spring loading of the locking piece (6) the shaped part 
(10) abuts a laterally disposed inclined face and/or edge 

(13). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 two shaped parts (10), which each 
abut one inclined face and/or edge (13), lie in a cross-bore 

(9) of the locking piece (6). 
A device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 a spring element (11), in 
particular a compression spring, is mounted between two 

shaped parts (10). 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the shaped part (10) is a ball or 
a pin rounded or chamfered particularly at the front.  

 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the locking piece (6) is mounted in 
a recess, the side walls of which form the inclined 

face(s). or edge(s). 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the locking piece (6) is mounted in 
a recess, which is externally closed by a lid (14), which 

forms the inclined face(s) and/or edge(s) (13). 
A device according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the lid (14) can be screwed into 
the recess and by its rotational adjustment the position 

of the inclined face(s) and/or edges (13) can be 
adjusted. 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the inclined face(s) is (are) 
convexly curved.
