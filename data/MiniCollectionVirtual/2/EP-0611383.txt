<ABSTRACT>
A rubber mixture is disclosed for producing rubber articles useful at low temperatures, oil-resistant, having a low crystallization tendency and a high dynamic stability, based on natural rubber, in particular viscosity-stabilized natural rubber, and usual mixture components. The rubber mixture essentially contains an additional 5 to 30 % by weight 1,4-polybutadiene with a high proportion of cis form and 5 to 30 % by weight of epoxidized natural rubber. Another variant of the mixture is also disclosed.
