<ABSTRACT>
Device for mutually anchoring the back (2) and the 
horizontal portion (3) of motor vehicle seats (4) including 

a disk (5) which is peripherally provided with teeth (5a) 
and is keyed on the axis (6) for the articulation of the 

back to the horizontal portion of the seat; the set of teeth 
has an orientation and can engage an articulated pawl (11) 

which has a complementary set of teeth (11b) and is kept in 
engaged position with elastic pusher elements (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for mutually 
anchoring the back and the horizontal portion of motor 
vehicle seats. It is known that in motor vehicles, and particularly in 
cars, the couplings for safety belts are located on the side 
posts of the body and on the floor of the passenger 
compartment. In order to better adapt the fit of the safety belts to 
the height of the people on board, these couplings have been 
equipped, on higher-level models, with a vertical adjustment 
for the couplings located on said posts. This technology certainly provides good results in 
terms of safety, but has the drawback of substantially 
limited practicality in use: use of the belts is in fact 
substantially unpleasant and is avoided by a large 
percentage of car users. In high-performance cars, in order to deal with this 
problem the couplings have been placed on board the seat, so 
as to avoid creating the discomfort caused by the oblique 
portion of the belt which is connected to the post and 
instead convert the belt into a sort of item of clothing to 
be "worn" with ease by the passengers. This solution is certainly the most appreciable from 
the functional point of view, but it has raised the problem 
of the mechanical strength resistance of the seat, and 
particularly of its back, if subjected to a sudden jerk 
caused by an accident. In order to pass the demanding crash-tests to which  
 
these structures are subjected, it has in fact been 
necessary to oversize the framework of the entire seat, with 
a consequent significant increase in overall weight. Furthermore, some types of couplings have in any case 
shown a dangerous fragility indeed between the horizontal 
portion of the seat and the point where the base of the back 
connects to said horizontal portion; since all backs are now 
of the reclining type, said back tends, under stress, to 
bend forward and to follow, due to the inertia caused by the 
weight of the back itself and of the passenger, the 
deceleration towards the front of the motor vehicle 
subjected to an impact. A pricipal aim of the present invention is to solve the 
above described problem of the known art by providing a 
device for mutually anchoring the back and the horizontal 
portion in motor vehicle seats which avoids the above 
mentioned bending of the back without having to resort to 
onerous increases in weight due to oversizing of the seat 
structure, allowing instead to adopt very light seats, such 
as those made of synthetic fiber, while nonetheless ensuring 
maximum

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for mutually anchoring the back (2) and 
the horizontal portion (3) of motor vehicle seats (4), 

comprising a disk (5) which is peripherally provided with 
teeth (5a) and can be keyed in fixed position on the axis 

(6) for the articulation of the back to the horizontal 
portion of the seat, one end of a semicircular link (8) 

being pivoted to an outer face (5b) of said disk, said link 
being arranged edgeways and parallel to said outer face, the 

opposite end of said link being vertically movable by virtue 
of associated means for contacting and lifting, in contrast 

with elastic pusher elements (10), an overlying pawl (11) 
which is articulated to the back, one face (11a) of said 

pawl being complementarily toothed for spontaneous 
engagement with said peripheral set of teeth of said disk in 

active configuration, said pawl being disengageable from the 
disk by performing a rotation so as to lift the back with 

respect to the horizontal portion of the seat. 
Anchoring device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said set of teeth (5a) of the disk is orientated in 

contrast with the rotation of the back onto the horizontal 
portion and affects the upper half of the circumference of 

the disk (5). 
Anchoring device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the convex portion of said semicircular link (8) is 

directed outwardly and its edge is substantially flush with 
said set of teeth (5a) of the disk (5). 
Anchoring device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said means for moving the link are constituted by a 

 
lever arm (12) which is mounted so that it rotates rigidly 

with said back articulation axis, the free end of said lever 
having the big end of a connecting rod (13) articulated 

thereto, the opposite end of said connecting rod being in 
turn articulated to the concurring end of the link. 
Anchoring device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said elastic pusher elements are constituted by an 

axially compressible cylinder (14) with spring-biased piston 
which is nor
mally in its expanded configuration, said 
cylinder being interposed between said pawl and the 

structure of the back. 
Device according to claims 1 and 3, characterized in 
that a pin (15) for contact with said edge of the link (8) 

protrudes laterally from said pawl (11). 
Device for mutually anchoring the back and the 
horizontal portion in motor vehicle seats, comprising one or 

more of the technical features described herein and/or 
described in the appended drawings.
