<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for issuing self-adhesive labels (16) adhering to a carrier strip (15) possesses a dispensing edge (17), round which the carrier strip (15) can be pulled in such a way that the self-adhesive label (16) comes loose from the carrier strip (15). In order, in an apparatus of this kind, to ensure that the dispensing edge can be made sufficiently sharp, even in the case of a large span and a large label width consequently to be provided, without support being necessary between its fastening ends, provision is made for the dispensing edge (17) to have a string-like or wire-like element which is tensioned between two side parts (30, 31) and the tension which can be adjusted.
