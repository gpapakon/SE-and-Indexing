<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile multifunction hall and to a trailer with a telescopic box body for transporting and constructing such a hall. A trailer (2) includes a telescopic box body (4) mounted on a conventional chassis, and formed of a lower box body with hinged side walls (5) and of stationary gable-ends (8) and of an outer box body with a telescopic roof (7) side wall raisers (6) and gable-end raisers (11), the said outer box body being able to move vertically and being able to be unfolded or folded back up from a low and folded-up transport position and a high and unfolded service position. A multifunction hall according to the invention consists mainly of:   - at least one trailer with a telescopic box body, the outer box body of which is lifted and unfolded, - at least one intermediate floor for connecting the beds of trailers, - a plurality of flexible partitions and roofing structures (12, 17, 21, 18).

Trailer for the transportation and the construction of a mobile multi-purpose
auditorium and its fittings of the type formed by a telescopic body constructed on a

chassis, said body comprising,

a lower portable body formed from two fixed pinions at the front and at the
rear, two lateral rails (5) pivotally mounted on the platform of the trailer, foldable

pinions (9) which are rigid and pivotally mounted on one end of a lateral rail (5), and
four lifting systems disposed at the four corners of the chassis; and
an upper body (4) formed from a telescopic roof assembly (1), two pinion
uprights (11) at the front and at the rear, and two lateral panels or rail uprights (6) on

each side, which are pivotally mounted on the roof (7) and can be opened laterally,
the upper body (4) being conceived to be vertically displaceable in the two directions

between a low position, which permits the travel configuration to be obtained by
folding back the rail uprights (6) in order to cover the lower body externally, and a

high position to obtain the operational configuration by opening the rail uprights (6),

characterised in that, in combination,
the chassis supporting the structure is a standard chassis;
the roof (7), the rail uprights (6), the pinions and pinion uprights (8, 11) are
made in rigid panels;
four lifting systems for raising the telescopic roof are disposed at the four
corners of the chassis, and their raising or lowering movements are synchronised; 
securing means are provided on the lifting systems for securing two trusses
(16), said trusses being installed in situ to ensure the connection between telescopic

roofs and to serve as a support for roofing panels (18); and
securing means are provided on the rail uprights ( 5 ) for half-trusses (15),
which are folded-up during transportation and unfoldable in situ, for the construction

of projections.
Trailer according to claim 1, characterised in that the foldable pinions (9) are
fitted with a anti-panic door.
Trailer according to the preceding claim, characterised in that at least one of
the lateral rails (5) is adjustable in respect of height, and in that the systems for

adjusting the height of the roof and of the lateral rails are provided to achieve a
height of 5.50 metres to the ceiling.
Trailer according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that at least
one of the lateral rails (5) has a extension-piece (28).
Trailer according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the rails

(5) are edged by flanges fitted with securing points for the securement of a central
floor (28).
Trailer according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
pinions (8) comprise vertical lateral rails for the sliding of the half-trusses (15)

therein.
Trailer according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it is
fitted with telescopic tiers.
Trailer according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
rails (5) are fitted with boxes (32) carrying gangways (35).
Mobile multi-purpose auditorium constructed from at least one transport
trailer, an assembly of flexible partitions and roofs, and fittings such as, more

especially, toilet installations, heating, tiers, dividing or peripheral partitions, an
auditorium of the type comprising:


at least one intermediate floor adjustable in height and forming the
connection between the platforms of two successive trailers; and
a plurality of flexible partitions such as the partitions (12, 17, 21) enclosing
the periphery of the multi-purpose auditorium;

and characterised in that it comprises, in combination:
a plurality of identical standard trailers according to one of the preceding
claims, the telescopic roofs of which are deployed and interconnected by trusses (16)

secured to the lifting systems for raising the roofs;
a tubular structure installed on the trusses (16) to carry a flexible roof (18)
for connecting the telescopic roofs of two adjacent trailers;
projections carried by the half-trusses (15) provided on the pinion uprights;
and
all of the stresses, due to the telescopic roofs, truss (16), half-truss (15),
flexible connecting roof (18) and projections, being borne by the chassis of the

trailers.
Mobile multi-purpose auditorium according to the preceding claim,
characterised in that it comprises, on one and the same side, three anti-panic double

doors for public use. 
Multi-purpose auditorium according to the preceding claim, characterised in
that it also comprises projecting structures, which form the public entrance and

artistes' dressing-rooms, formed from a tubular structure covered by awnings.
