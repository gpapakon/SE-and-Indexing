<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid, one-piece combination of a 
filter and an ion exchange resin. The filter material, which is a 
porous thermoplastic resin, is combined with particles of ion 
exchange resin and the combination is sintered to form the 
combination. The prepared combination can be used in the treatment 
of many fluids such as air, gases, smoke or vapors, liquids such as 
water and body fluids. The prior art is aware of water treatment apparatuses which 
contain treatment material sintered to porous bodies. Thus, Busch 
et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,534, disclose a water filter and 
treatment apparatus which contains a sintered polyethylene resin 
containing particles of charcoal and silver. This apparatus also 
contains free-standing ion exchange resin particles which serve 
as a water softener. The ion exchange resin is intentionally 
maintained apart from the sintered polyethylene filter and 
treatment portion of the apparatus. The prior art is also aware of 
water treatment apparatuses containing ion exchange resin beads 
held together with polymeric material. Thus, Heskett et al 
disclose in U.S. Pat. No. 3,538,020, aggregates of ion exchange 
particles entrapped in a polymer for use in a water softening 
device. This patent fails to disclose a sintering step in the 
preparation of the water treatment device. The device of Busch et al has the disadvantage of maintaining 
the polyethylene filter mechanism separate from the ion exchange 
part, thus requiring a large apparatus. The present invention seeks to overcome the disadvantage found 
in the Busch et al apparatus and to provide a combination of  
 
mechanical filtration and ion exchange function in a single 
element. Thus, this invention relates to a combination of at least one 
ion exchange resin and at least one thermoplastic polymeric binder 
sintered to form a one-piece apparatus for filtering fluids and 
exchanging ions with materials in the fluids, both air and liquid. The apparatus of this invention provides a solid matrix which 
prevents fluid flow channeling often seen in loose resin bed 
products and presents a low restriction to flow. The apparatus of 
the invention may be obtained at low cost, using conventional 
resins as binders and ion exchange resins. A wide variety of sizes 
and shapes may be simply obtained. Such shapes include hollow 
cylinders, hollow cylinders with one closed end, solid cylinders, 
sheets, disks, and domes. The present invention also provides for ease of assembly, 
thereby resulting in lower
