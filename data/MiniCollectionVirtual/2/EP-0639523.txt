<ABSTRACT>
Chopper action folding apparatus for high speed 
printing or similar processing plant is shown 

diagrammatically in Figure 3. A conveyor (10) feeds 
signatures (12) towards a headstop (20). A vertical 

chopper blade (24) extending along the centre of the feed 
path is oscillated to initiate longitudinal folding of 

each signature as it is pressed downwards into a nip 
between longitudinal folding rolls (22) below the feed 

path which complete the folding process by drawing the 
signature downward. Brush or other braking means (26) 

slow or stop the approaching signatures before or as they 
reach the headstop so that they are folded without 

damage, the braking pressure being automatically 
regulated by control means (30) including infra-red or 

other position sensing means (32) which detects the 
relative positions of the headstock and approaching 

leading edge (14) of each signature for optimum 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chopper action folding 
apparatus particularly for high speed large capacity 
automated operation at the output end of continuous web 
fed printing or other processing plant. From EP-A-0 462 421 a folding apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is known. The object of the invention is to provide folding 
apparatus which is reliable, efficient and adaptable in 
operation and which is particularly suited to highly 
automated control systems for precision high speed 
operation and having facility for simple and speedy 
changeover by remote control of operating modes. According to the invention there is provided chopper 
action folding apparatus including: 
a) conveyor means for carrying a stream of 
successive multi or single sheet pre-folded or non-folded 
signatures along a feed path, b) a headstop formation having an abutment face 
which can operatively positioned in said path to limit 
forward travel therealong of each signature, c) a chopper element guided for oscillating 
movement into and out of intersecting relationship with 
the feed path in a folding zone thereof which extends 
upstream from the abutment face, d) a pair of folding elements defining a nip 
immediately adjacent to said zone for receiving and 
removing a signature tucked facewise into said nip, e) chopper drive means operating the chopper 
element in phased relationship to the delivery of each 
signature to said zone to institute folding or further 
folding thereof by tucking it into said nip, and f) braking means in said zone for substantially 
slowing or stopping forward movement of each signature as 
it nears or reaches the abutment face to be acted on by 
the chopper element; 
characterised in that said apparatus further includes g) control means including position sensing means 
in or adjacent the folding zone operatively detecting the 
relative positions of the abutment face and the  
 
approaching or halted leading edge of each successive 
signature in said zone, and regulating means 
automatically adjusting the effect of the braking means 
on the signatures in use in response to readout from the 
sensing means whereby the chopper element acts on each 
signature at an optimum position in said zone at which 
the leading edge is so related to the abutment face that 
the signature is undamaged and is effectively and 
accurately folded. Preferably the sensing means comprises a pair of 
position sensors at respective positions spaced laterally 
of the feed path and independently responsive to the
