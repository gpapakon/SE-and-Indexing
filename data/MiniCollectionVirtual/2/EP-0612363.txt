<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a short dwell coater apparatus and method for 
the application of coating material to a web which is supported by a 
backing member. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
short dwell coater apparatus having means for reducing a vortex 
generated within the application zone of the apparatus. Short dwell coaters permit the application of pressurized coating 
material to a web movably supported on a backing roll. Typically, a short 
dwell coater includes an application zone having an open face towards the 
web so that the coating material is applied to the web with excess coating 
material being removed from the web by a blade defining the downstream 
end of the application zone. Short dwell coaters permit the application of a relatively thin layer of 
coating material to a web because the dwell time of the web moving past 
the application zone is relatively short. Therefore, the coating material has 
little time to absorb deeply into the surface of the web to be coated. The aforementioned short dwell coater also has the advantage that 
by applying a relatively thin coating to the web, economy of coating 
material is achieved.  
 In EP-A-0 426 606 there is described a short 
dwell coater apparatus according to the preamble of 
claim 1. More specifically, EP-A-0 426 606 discloses a 
short dwell coater apparatus for the application of 
coating material to a web. The apparatus comprises a 
backing member which supports the web during operation, 
a housing disposed closely adjacent to the backing 
member such that the web is movable between the housing 
and the backing member during operation, the housing 
defining an application zone which is connectable to a 
pressurized source of the coating material, the 
application zone having an open face toward the backing 
member, and blade means adjustably secured to the 
housing and extending from the housing towards the 
backing member, the blade means defining a downstream 
extremity of the application zone. A method for the application of coating 
material according to the preamble of claim 13 is also 
known from EP-A-0 426 606.  
 However, during high speed application of coating material utilizing 
a short dwell coater apparatus, it has been observed that machine 
directional streaks appear on the surface of the coated web. More particularly, it is thought that such streaking is as a result of 
air passing between the web and the apparatus becoming entrapped 
within the application zone and such air forming a
