<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metal strip for producing an electrolytic capacitor, its use as an electrode and a method for its production, the metal strip surface having a microporous thermoplastic coating (1). The thermoplastic coating (2) is applied by means of a thermal method or by bonding, either on one side or on both sides, on the electrode surfaces (5).

Metal strip (1) preferably aluminium strip for production of an
electrode for an electrolytic capacitor, with a thermoplastic coating

at least on one side which is porous at least in parts, characterised
in that the metal strip has a thickness between 5 pm and 300 pm and the

coating is formed by a micro-porous thermoplastic separating layer (2,
3) bonded to the metal strip surface by welding or adhesion and made of

coating material which can stretch on application and has a thickness
of 5 µm to 80 µm.
Metal strip according to claim 1, characterised in that the micro-porous
thermoplastic separating layer (2, 3) is provided on both sides.
Metal strip according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by uncoated areas
for the application of connection contacts.
Metal strip according to any of the previous claims, characterised in
that the pores of the separating layer (2, 3) have approximately the

same dimensions as the pores of a metal strip etching.
Metal strip according to any of the previous claims characterised in
that the diameter of the pores is less than 500 µm and preferably lies

in a range from 1.5 µm to 5 µm.
Metal strip according to any of the previous claims, characterised in
that the thermoplastic separating layer (2, 3) consists of

polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene,
polycarbonate, polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene

isophthalate or a copolymer of the two latter substances.
Process for production of a coated metal strip according to any of
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that after treatment of the metal strip

(1) as etching foil, the micro-porous thermoplastic separating layer
(2, 3) is bonded to the metal strip surface (4) by welding or adhesion.
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that after coating, the
metal strip is rolled into a storage roll where the thickness and

porosity of the coating can be set by controlling the winding process. 
Electrode for an electrolytic capacitor consisting of a coated metal
strip according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the

coated metal strip is formed as an anode and/or cathode.
Electrode according to claim 9, characterised in that the anode and/or
cathode consists of a metal strip coated on one or both sides.
Electrode according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in that the anode
and/or cathode is uncoated in the area of the contacts.
