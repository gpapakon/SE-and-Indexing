<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of producing certain kinds of
N-alkylacetamides which are useful as bactericides or fungicides for agricultural use.It is well known that N-alkylacetamides of the general formula (III):

wherein X1, X2 and X3 are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, lower
alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, halogen or trifluoromethyl; R1 and R2 are the same
or different and are independently lower alkyl; and  represents a chemical bond of
E- or Z- configuration, or a mixture of these configurations, are useful as bactericides or
fungicides for agricultural use. A process for their production is disclosed inJP-A-288045/1992. In this process, a certain acetonitrile
compound ( I ) is hydrolyzed into the corresponding acetamide (II), which is then reacted
with an alkylating agent in the presence of a base, as shown in the reaction scheme:
 
wherein X1, X2, X3, R1, R2 and  are each as defined above.EP-A-0 528 681 and
EP-A-0 468 775 relate also to fungicides of the same class.The above process, however, has serious disadvantages that the yield of the
acetamide (II') as an intermediate is as low as about 70% and that the desired compound
is only obtained in as low yield as about 50% because the N,N-dialkyl product (III') is
formed as a by-product through the reaction of the intermediate and the alkylating agent.Accordingly, there is a great demand for the development of a process of
producing an N-alkylacetamide as the desired compound in high yield without going
through the above intermediate.It is the object of the present invention to provide a process
of producing an N-alkylacetamide of the general formula
(III) in high yield, which can overcome the above disadvantages.
This object could be achieved on the basis of the finding
that the initial
reaction of a particular acetonitrile compound with an alkylamine to give an N-alkylacetamidine
as an intermediate and the subsequent reaction of the intermediate with a nitrite
derivative can provide the desired N-alkylacetamide in high yield .Thus, the present invention provides a process of producing an N-alkylacetamide
of the general formula (III):

wherein X1, X2, and X3 are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, lower
alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, halogen or trifluoromethyl; R1 and R2 are the same
or different and are independently lower alkyl; and  represents a chemical bond of
E- or Z-configuration, or a mixture of these configurations, which comprises the steps of: 
(a) reacting an acetonitrile
