<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing dimethyl carbonate is 
carried out by a first step of catalytically reacting 

carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite to produce dimethyl 
carbonate; a second step of absorbing dimethyl carbonate 

contained in a gas fraction withdrawn from the first step 
by dimethyl oxalate; a third step of regenerating methyl 

nitrite by contacting nitrogen monoxide contained in a 
gas fraction withdrawn from the second step with a 

molecular oxygen-containing gas and methyl alcohol; a 
fourth step of collecting dimethyl carbonate by 

distilling a liquid fraction withdrawn from the second 
step; and a fifth step of recovering methyl nitrite from 

a purge gas consisting of a portion of a regenerated gas 
fraction withdrawn from the third step by absorbing 

methyl nitrite in the purge gas by methyl alcohol to 
provide a methyl nitrite-containing liquid fraction and a 

nitrogen monoxide-containing gas fraction and bringing 
the gas fraction into contact with a molecular oxygen and 

methyl alcohol, to convert nitrogen monoxide in the gas 
fraction to methyl nitrite and to absorb this methyl 

nitrite by methyl alcohol, whereby methyl nitrite and 
nitrogen monoxide in the purge gas is recovered and 

reused with a high efficiency at a high level of safety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
continuously producing dimethyl carbonate. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an 
industrial process for continuously producing dimethyl 
carbonate by a catalytical reaction in gas phase of 
carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite in the presence of a 
solid catalyst, while effectively and safely recovering 
methyl nitrite and nitrogen monoxide from a purge gas 
withdrawn from a gas system circulating through a 
reaction system, and recycling the recovered methyl 
nitrite and nitrogen monoxide to the production of 
dimethyl carbonate. Dimethyl carbonate is a compound useful as a 
material for synthesizing aromatic polycarbonates, 
medicines and agricultural chemicals, and as a solvent. A conventional industrial process for producing 
dimethyl carbonate by a catalytical reaction in gas phase 
of carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite in the presence of 
a solid catalyst comprises, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 5,214,185, a first step of catalytically reacting 
carbon monoxide with methyl nitrite in gas phase in the 
presence of a solid catalyst in a reactor to produce 
dimethyl carbonate; a second step of absorbing dimethyl 
carbonate produced in the first step by an absorbing 
medium consisting of dimethyl oxalate in a dimethyl 
carbonate-absorbing column (absorbing column), to provide 
a liquid fraction comprising dimethyl carbonate absorbed 
by dimethyl oxalate and a non-condensed gas fraction 
containing nitrogen monoxide; a third step of 
regenerating methyl nitrite by bringing nitrogen monoxide 
in the non-condensed gas fraction into contact with  
 
molecular oxygen and methyl alcohol in a methyl nitrite-regenerating 
column (regenerating column); and a fourth 
step of distil-collecting dimethyl carbonate from the 
liquid fraction produced in the second step and 
containing dimethyl oxalate in which dimethyl carbonate 
is absorbed, in an extract-distilling column and a 
dimethyl carbonate-distilling column. In the above-mentioned process, a gas 
containing carbon monoxide and methyl nitrite circulate 
through the first step, the second step and the third 
step. This circulating gas further contains a carbon 
dioxide gas which is produced as a by-product of the gas 
phase catalytical reaction of the first step, and an 
inert gas, for example, nitrogen gas, which is introduced 
into the circulating gas by accompanying with a NOx gas 
which is fed into the regenerating column to synthesize 
methyl nitrite. Therefore, to avoid the
