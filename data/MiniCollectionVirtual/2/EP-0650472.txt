<ABSTRACT>
Chain-extended polyamines with at least one fatty acid moiety are produced. One or more polyorgano amine compounds having alkyl, aryl, and/or alkylaryl groups are reacted with a chain extender that is difunctional for reaction with the amine groups of the polyamine. The number of carbon atoms for the chain extender and the amount of amine functionality on the polyamine is balanced to produce at least a water-dispersible chain-extended polyamine. The chain-extended polyamine is further reacted or the polyamine and the chain-extender are reacted simultaneously with one or more fatty acids which are predominantly monovalent for reaction with the chain-extended polyamine to produce chain-extended polyamine with at least one fatty acid moiety that is at least water-dispersible. These materials can be present with or without water on various substrates including fibers, strands, yarns and glass substrates like these and plates and beads.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REACTION PRODUCTS OF CHAIN-EXTENDED POLYAMINE COMPOUNDS AND FATTY ACID-CONTAINING MATERIALSThe present invention is directed to a reaction product that is a polymeric composition derived from polyamines through chain extension and reaction with fatty acids that are useful as10 surfactants, emulsifiers, dispersants and lubricants, and particularly fiber lubricants.The reaction of polyamine compounds with fatty acids leads to several types of useful materials ranging from polymers to lubricants. For instance, polymeric products are made through the15 reaction of polyalkylene polyamines with the so-called polymeric fat acids which are a mixture of dibasic and tribasic acids with molecular weights of approximately 560 to 840. The polymeric fat acids are derived from vegetable oils, such as soybean, linseed and cottonseed oils, and their glycerides contain substantial amounts of20 polyunsaturated fat acid radicals.Some lubricants are useful as fiber lubricants in the manufacture and processing of various natural and synthetic fibers and/or strands such as polyesters, polyacrylics, polyolefins, polyamides and glass. Some of these lubricants that are cationic in25 nature include the reaction of tetraethylenepentamine and stearic acid, and partially amidated polyalkyleneamines that are reaction products of a mixture of C to C-^g fatty acids with a polyethylenimine having a molecular weight of about 1200. These reaction products have a residual amine value of from about 300 to30 400. Even though the reaction of polyalkylene amines or imines and fatty acids are well known, some of the starting materials for the reactions can involve specialty chemicals that have less than favorable environmental and health impacts.It is an object of the present invention to provide a35 polymeric composition derived from polyamine compounds using 

 chemicals with better environmental and safety impacts and resulting in good lubricating properties especially as fiber lubricants, but that can result in satisfactory properties for other possible uses such as e ulsifiers and/or surfactants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, in view of the above objects and other objects gleaned from the following disclosure, the present invention is a polymeric reaction product of one or more polyorgano amine compounds having alkyl, aryl, and/or alkylaryl groups with a chain extender and with one or more fatty acid materials. The polyorgano amine compounds can be reacted simultaneously or sequentially with the chain extender and/or the fatty acid
