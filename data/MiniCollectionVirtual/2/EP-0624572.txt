<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an agent for the permanent reshaping of hair which, as keratin-reducing active compound, contains a 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic ester of the formula (I
>
 HS-CH2-CH(OH)COOR  (I
>
 where R = an alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group or a dihydroxyalkyl group,  and novel 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic esters. The agent according to the invention allows gentle and uniform reshaping of the hair without allergic or sensitizing reactions.
