<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved process for 
the synthesis of 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde 
from 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde, I, is a 
starting material for the preparation of a preferred 
manganese salen catalyst of formula II [see Jacobsen 
et al., J. Am.Chem.Soc.113, 7063-7064 (1991)] 
3,5-Di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde was prepared by 
Jacobsen et al. by the reaction of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol 
with formaldehyde in the presence of SnCl4 
and 2,6-lutidine (Casiraghi et al., J.C.S.P.1, 1980, 
1862-1865). The use of relatively expensive reagents 
such as SnCl4 and lutidine, and the production of 
hazardous wastes make the procedure of Casiraghi 
unattractive for large-scale synthesis. It is known that phenols and other activated 
aromatic compounds can be converted to the 
corresponding aldehydes by treatment with 
hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (formula III). 
 
The reaction is known in the art as the Duff 
reaction; it has been reviewed by Blazevic et al. 
[Synthesis, 1979, 164-167]. The Duff reaction is 
commonly carried out with HBO2 in dry glycerol, 
although variations have been reported with 
trifluoroacetic acid and glacial acetic acid. 
Unfortunately, although the Duff reaction is usually 
successful with other activated phenols, it is 
notoriously poor when the substrate is a 2,4-dialkylphenol. 
For example, Blazevic et al. (op. 
cit.) report the formulation of 2-methyl-4-neopentylphenol 
using glycerol/boric acid in 19% 
overall yield. When Komissarova et al. attempted  
 
formulation of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol using 
hexamethylenetetramine in the Duff reaction, they 
observed that the only product was a dihydro-1,3-benzoxazine 
[Chemical Abstracts, 110: 212723c]. 
 
Yahagi reported that the corresponding 1,3-benzoxazine 
could be prepared very efficiently from 
2,4-dimethylphenol and hexamethylenetetramine 
[Chemical Abstracts, 93: 8106e]. Because persons of skill in the art believed 
that the Duff reaction with HMT and acid was not 
preparatively useful for dialkyl salicylaldehydes, 
Zigeuner and Jellinek [Monatsh.Chem.90, 297-305 
(1959) p. 299] proposed a different synthetic route. 
They stated that "On the basis of the oxidative 
cleavage of the dibenzylamines... which proceeds in 
high yield, a new synthesis of 2-hydroxy-3,5-disubstituted 
benzaldehydes, which are difficult to 
prepare by the usual preparative methods, was 
developed." Their method comprised preparing a  
 
dibenzylamine from the reaction of an appropriate 
phenol with
