<ABSTRACT>
Assembly tools for mounting a plurality of modules each of which has a pair of retaining features (S1) on a surface (u) wherein the retaining features (S1) are spaced a predetermined distance apart, are characterized by an elongated bar member (12) having an array of grasping elements (22c). The grasping elements (22c) engage with the retaining features (S1) on the modules to hold the individual modules to the bar (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 TOOL FOR MODULAR HEADER AND RECEPTACLE CONNECTORSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to tools useful for assembling either a plurality of header connector modules or a plurality of receptacle connector modules to form a composite header connector or composite receptacle connector having a desired custom length.Description of the Prior Art Metral™ header connectors and receptacle connectors, such as those sold by the Electronics Department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, are available in various standardized lengths. Available header and receptacle modules are discussed generally in the DuPont Connector Systems Product Catalog A, February 1992, Chapter 10. Such header connectors and receptacle connectors may be provided with a keying arrangement to permit mated engagement only between a header connector and its associated receptacle. The keying arrangement utilizes complementary keying blocks that are attachable to retaining features on the housings of the header connector and its associated receptacle connector.For this purpose the housing of the header connector has retaining features in the form latching tabs disposed along the boundaries of slots provided in the side wall of the header connector housing. The keying block for the header connector has a pair of hook-like anchors that are insertable into the slots and which latch onto the tabs thereby to attach the keying block to the header housing.In the case of the receptacle connector the retaining features take the form of a pair of arms extending from the exterior of the bottom wall of the receptacle connector 

housing. The forward portion of each arm is spaced below the bottom wall of the housing and cooperates therewith to define a gap sized to accepts flanges on the keying block. Engagement of the flanges on the keying block within the gaps assists in holding the keying block to the receptacle housing.The length of each of the various available header connectors or receptacle connectors is an integer multiple of a basic unit length L. In some custom applications, such as header connectors and receptacle connectors useful in implementing IEEE Standard 1301 For Metric Equipment Practice For Microcomputers, 1991 , it may be necessary to provide Metral™ header connectors and Metral™ receptacle connectors that exhibit a custom length that is not available in a off-the-shelf product. Presently, meet such a need it is the practice to mold a housing for a header connector or for a receptacle

CLAIMS
1. A tool for assembling a custom length header from two or more individual header modules each having a length that is an integer multiple of a basic unit length L to form a composite header having a custom length of at least 2L, each module having a base with two sidewalls extending therefrom, a sidewall of each module having at least two slots formed therein, each slot in each module being spaced at least a distance L 2 from an adjacent slot, the tool comprising: a bar having a planar upper surface with a leading edge and a trailing edge and first and second lateral ends, and a plurality of anchor hooks arranged in a linear array across the planar surface of the bar between the first and second lateral ends, each anchor hook in the array being spaced from an adjacent hook by a distance that is an integer multiple of the distance U2, each anchor hook in the array being sized for entry into a slot in a module, the bar and each module mounted thereon being relatively movable to a latched position in which the anchor hooks on the bar are in mated engagement with the tabs defined in each module.
2. The tool of claim 1 wherein the bar has a predetermined transverse dimension between the leading edge and the linear array of anchor hooks, the transverse dimension being sized such that the leading edge of the bar extends beyond the base of the module when the anchor hooks are in mated engagement with the tab on the sidewall. 


 3. The tool of claim 2 wherein the bar has a lower surface thereon, a handle extending from the lower surface of the bar.
4. The tool of claim 3 wherein the handle extends from the lower surface of the bar adjacent to the trailing edge thereof.
5. The tool of claim 1 wherein the bar has a lower surface thereon, a handle extending from the lower surface of the bar.
6. The tool of claim 4 wherein the handle extends from the lower surface of the bar adjacent to the trailing edge thereof.
7. A tool for assembling a custom length receptacle connector from two or more individual receptacle connector modules, each receptacle connector module having a length that is an integer multiple of a basic unit length L, to form a composite receptacle having a custom length of at least 2L, each receptacle connector module having a base and a pair of end walls, a plurality of arms depending from the base, at least two of the arms having an outer lateral surface that is coplanar with an end wall, the outer lateral surfaces on the two arms being spaced by an integer multiple of the distance
L, each arm on the receptacle connector module having a leading and a trailing end with a predetermined width dimension being defined therebetween, a portion of each arm being spaced from the base to define a gap, the tool comprising: a bar having a planar surface with a leading and a trailing edge and first and second lateral 


 ends, an upstanding wall disposed at the trailing edge of the planar surface, a plurality of upturned lip segments being disposed along the leading edge of the bar and a plurality of ridge segments being disposed on the wall between the first and second lateral ends of the bar, each ridge segment being in transverse alignment with a corresponding lip segment, a portion of each adjacent lip segment and a portion of each adjacent ridge segment being spaced apart by a distance L, the transverse dimension between each lip segment and the upstanding wall being substantially equal to the predetermined width dimension of each arm, such that, when in the tool is mated with a receptacle connector module, at least some of the ridge segments on the wall are received within at least some of the gaps defined on the module while the trailing end of at least some of the arms contacts against some of the lip segments on the bar.
8. The tool of claim 7 wherein the bar has a longitudinal axis extending therethrough, the tool further comprising stop surfaces disposed on the bar in adjacency to some of the ridge segments and some of the lip segments to prevent relative longitudinal movement of a receptacle connector module with respect to the bar.
