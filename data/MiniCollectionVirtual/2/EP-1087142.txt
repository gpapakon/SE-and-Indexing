<ABSTRACT>
A scroll compressor includes a capacity modulation system. The capacity
modulation system has a piston that is connected to the non-orbiting scroll that

disengages the non-orbiting scroll from the orbiting scroll when a pressure chamber is
placed in communication with the suction chamber of the compressor. The non-orbiting

scroll member moves into engagement with the orbiting scroll when the chamber is
placed in communication with the discharge chamber. The engagement between the

two scrolls is broken when the pressure chamber is placed in communication with fluid
from the suction chamber. A solenoid valve controls the communication between the

pressure chamber and the suction chamber. By operating the valve in a pulsed width
modulated mode, the capacity of the compressor can be infinitely varied between zero

and one hundred percent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to scroll-type machinery. More particularly, the present invention is directed towards capacity modulation of scroll-type compressors.Scroll machines are becoming more and more popular for use as compressors in refrigeration systems as well as air conditioning and heat pump applications. The popularity of scroll machinery is primarily due to their capability for extremely efficient operation. Generally, these machines incorporate a pair of intermeshed spiral wraps, one of which is caused to orbit with respect to the other so as to define one or more moving chambers which progressively decrease in size as they travel from an outer suction port towards a center discharge port. An electric motor is normally provided which operates to drive the scroll members via a suitable drive shaft. During normal operation, these scroll machines are designed to have a fixed compression ratio.Air conditioning and refrigeration systems experience a wide range of loading requirements. Using a fixed compression ratio compressor to meet this wide range of loading requirements can present various problems to the designer of the system. One method of adapting the fixed compression ratio compressors to the wide range of loading requirements is to incorporate a capacity modulation system into the compressor. Capacity modulation has proven to be a desirable feature to incorporate into the air conditioning and refrigeration compressors in order to better accommodate the wide range of loading to which the systems may be subjected. Many different approaches have been utilized for providing this capacity modulation feature. These prior art systems have ranged from control of the suction inlet to bypassing compressed discharge gas directly back into the suction area of the compressor. With scroll-type compressors, capacity modulation has often been accomplished via a delayed suction approach which comprises providing ports at various positions along the route of the compression chambers which, when opened, allow the compression chambers formed between the intermeshing scroll wraps to communicate with the suction gas supply, thus delaying the point at which compression of the suction gas begins. This delayed suction method of capacity modulation actually reduces the compression ratio of the compressor. While such systems are effective at reducing the capacity of the compressor, they are only capable of providing a predetermined or stepped amount of compressor unloading. The amount of unloading or the
