<ABSTRACT>
Biomolecules are separated using magnetisable polymer-based particles derivatised with a ligand having direct binding affinity for nucleic acids or other types of biopolymer molecule. The particles are used for nucleic acid (and other biomolecular) purification and speciations, including double or single stranded nucleic acids, genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, and cellular RNA.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MAGNETIC SOLID PHASE SUPPORTSThis invention relates to the isolation and purification of molecules of biological interest eg proteins, nucleic acids, and other biopolymers.The purification of molecules of the above kinds often involve multi-step procedures requiring much time, technically complex equipment and potentially hazardous reagents. An affinity chromatography step is often the final or penultimate step. Ideally this step should be employed as early as possible in the process to maximise the yield of desired product and minimise the time required to generate it. Usually this is not feasible as the substance of interest (ligate) is present in a medium not readily amenable to conventional column affinity chromatography. Often the ligate may be present in a mixture of substances containing particulate and/or semi-solid or colloidal material such as cell debris and denatured cell components and/or in a mixture which is highly viscous. Column chromatography demands that both these factors be as low as possible and the steps in a purification procedure prior to affinity chromatography are engaged in minimising these two factors. They also result in the loss of at least some of the desired end product and an increase in the time required to collect it.The present invention is concerned with the development of relatively simple techniques for use with complex mixtures of high viscosity and/or those containing particulate matter and which are based on the use of magnetisable solid phase support (MSPS) materials. The use of magnetic separation in biological systems has been proposed in recent years. However, in spite of the 

fact that the facilities required for magnetic separation are much less costly and complex than those required for column chromatography or centrifugation the techniques have not so far received the attention they deserve.The present invention comprises magnetisable polymer based particles derivatised with ligands possessing direct-binding affinities for nucleic acids and other types of biomolecule, and the use of these particles for nucleic acid (and other biomolecular) purification and speciation, including double or single stranded nucleic acids, genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, and cellular RNA.The direct binding of the ligand to the target molecule is important to achieve the benefits of this invention as contrasted with prior proposals based on indirect linking of the target molecules eg. through intercalating agents as described in EP 301,899 A.The present invention comprises
