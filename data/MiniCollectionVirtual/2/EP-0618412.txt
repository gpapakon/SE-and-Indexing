<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a refrigeration unit, consisting of a refrigerant circuit with evaporator (V) and condenser (1) which is arranged in a liquid receptacle (2) and the latter, for its part, is connected via pipes to a further liquid receptacle (3), cold water supply connections (4) and hot water discharge connections (5) being provided in the liquid circuit. According to the invention, the two liquid receptacles (2, 3) are joined together to form one receptacle (B) with two chambers (6, 7). The lower chamber (6) is dimensioned to be substantially adapted to the size of the condenser (1) and the upper chamber (7) is equipped with the hot-water connection (5), arranged on it at the top, and the cold-water connection (4), arranged on it at the bottom. Both chambers (6, 7) are in connection in the interior of the receptacle (B) via an ascending pipe (8) which opens out in the upper region of the upper chamber (7) and a descending pipe (9) which opens out in the lower region of the lower chamber (6). Arranged on the lower chamber (6) is a temperature sensor (10) and arranged in the lower region of the upper chamber (7) is an overflow valve (11) which can be controlled by the temperature sensor (10). Thus, the object is achieved of providing a compact refrigeration unit in which, while avoiding external pipes, both water tanks are integral constituents of the refrigeration unit, together with the proviso of ensuring with simple means that a sufficiently large  DELTA  T is always available in the region in which the condenser is arranged.
