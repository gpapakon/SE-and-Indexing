<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a carboxylic acid anhydride 
comprises contacting a reaction composition comprising a carboxylic 

acid ester, a hydrocarbyl halide and/or a hydrocarbyl ether reactant 
and a hydrocarbyl halide promoter with carbon monoxide in the 

presence of a catalyst comprising an insoluble polymer support having 
pendant quaternised N-base or alkylated N-oxide pyridine groups 

supporting a rhodium species in which process the rhodium species is 
prevented from leaching from the polymer support by maintaining 

throughout the process a finite concentration of carboxylic acid 
anhydride in the reaction composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of
carboxylic acid anhydrides and in particular to a process for the
production of carboxylic acid anhydrides in the presence of a
carbonylation catalyst comprising a polymer supported rhodium
species.Carbonylation processes are known in which small organic
molecules such as alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, esters, hydrocarbyl
halides or hydrocarbyl ethers are reacted with carbon monoxide in the
liquid phase and in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, for
example rhodium. When esters, hydrocarbyl halides or hydrocarbyl
ethers are used as reactants carboxylic acid anhydrides can be
produced. It is usual in such processes to use a homogeneous
transition metal catalyst.US 4,328,125 describes heterogeneous anionic transition metal
catalysts containing a catalytically effective amount of an anionic
species having the formula Mn(CO)m(X)p z-, said anionic species being
ionically bound to an insoluble crosslinked anion exchange resin
containing a bound quaternary ammonium cation. Such catalysts are
said to effect carbonylation and hydroformylation reactions and are
said to be prepared by treating a resin containing a polymeric
quaternary ammonium salt with a neutral transition metal carbonyl
compound. Suitable resins are said to include polyvinyl pyridines
and polystyrene bound pyridines. The Examples given in US 4,328,125
all relate to rhodium supported catalysts. All of the examples of
carbonylation reactions in US 4,328,125 take place in the presence of 
water and/or methanol to produce acetic acid. Leaching of rhodium is
observed at elevated temperature during the carbonylation of methanol
in Examples 12 and 13. The carbonylation reaction conditions
reported in US 4,328,125 are 54-162 psi and up to 130Â°C.US 5,155,261 describes a process for the carbonylation of
methanol to acetic acid which uses a heterogeneous catalyst
comprising an insoluble polymer having pendant free base, N-oxide or
quaternised pyridine groups or a combination thereof supporting a
rhodium species loaded to less than about 10 weight percent
(expressed as metal) of the polymer component. Most preferred
catalysts are said to be porous cross-linked 4 or 2-vinylpyridine
copolymers in the free base or N-oxide form which have been
quaternised either preformed or in situ with an alkyl halide such as
methyl iodide and loaded at about 2 weight percent by reaction with a
rhodium salt such as rhodium chloride trihydrate in an initial or
generation run.Whilst US 5,155,261 states at Column 9,
