<ABSTRACT>
An interdental device for simultaneous brushing and 
irrigation of spaces between teeth and under bridges 

consisting of an interdental brush (2) at distal part of a 
tubular rigid or semi-rigid introducer arm (7), the proximal 

end of said arm comprising a connecting part to outlet of 
a syringe or other type of liquid pumping device, said 

liquid being discharged from arm (7) at or near said distally 
placed interdental brush.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interdental device 
for simultaneous brushing and irrigation of interproximal 
tooth surfaces and surfaces of bridges unaccessible to 
conventional tooth brushes. More specifically the present 
invention relates to an interdental brush fixed to a 
tubular rigid or semi-rigid introducer arm that enables 
liquid flow for the combined brushing and irrigation in 
spaces between teeth and under bridges. The cause of the main dental diseases, i.e. caries and 
periodontal disease, is the dental plaque. The plaque 
consists of a mixture of bacteria, some of which are 
pathogenic, and an extracellular carbohydrate moiety 
responsible for the adherence of the plaque to the tooth 
surfaces. Effective plaque control is the only known 
approach for the prevention of caries and periodontal 
disease. The most effective plaque control measures are 
tooth brushing and/or irrigation with antimicrobial 
solutions or agents that initiate disintegration of the 
plaque (U.S. pat No. 4,666,708 & 4,657,758). Plaque removal from most tooth surfaces is attainable 
using tooth brushes and conventional irrigation devices 
(U.S. pat. No. 4302186 & 4337040). These measures,  
 
however, do not effectively penetrate the interdental space 
to access interproximal tooth surfaces. In many 
individuals with healthy gums most of the plaque from the 
interproximal tooth surfaces can be removed by using dental 
floss, tooth picks, or by irrigation with a special 
flexible probe (U.S. pat No. 5,127,831). When the 
interdental space is increased, usually as a result of 
periodontal inflammation and gingival regression, 
interproximal plaque control can be achieved more 
effectively by using a specially designed interdental brush 
(U.S. pat. No. 4,805,252). The interdental brush is also 
an effective measure for otherwise inaccessible bridge 
surfaces. It is rather surprising that a device for the 
combined brushing and irrigation is not yet known for 
enhanced effectiveness of interproximal and under-bridge 
plaque control. The present invention relates to an interdental device 
for simultaneous brushing and irrigation of spaces between 
teeth and under bridges consisting of an interdental brush 
connected to the distal part of a tubular rigid or semi-rigid 
bent or straight introducer arm, the proximal end of 
said arm comprising a connecting hub to outlet of a syringe 
or any other liquid pumping device, said liquid being 
discharged from arm at or near said distally placed 
interdental brush.  The
