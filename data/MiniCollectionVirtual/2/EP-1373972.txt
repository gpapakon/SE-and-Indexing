<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an LC display comprising a light source (5) that provides the background illumination, that emits light of only a part of the spectrum and that is disposed on the back (9) of a liquid crystal layer (10). At least one optoelectronic component (6) is also accommodated on the back (9) of the liquid crystal layer (10) so as to be protected and covered while it still is able to detect or emit light through the liquid crystal layer (10). The detected light is evaluated to control the background illumination and the inventive device enables data communication with an external device.
