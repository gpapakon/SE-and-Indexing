<ABSTRACT>
Contact pads (12) are separated from the counter electrode contacts (20) by a passivation layer (22). The electrical connection between the counter electrode and the contacts (20) is made by removing, at least in part, around the assembly of the two plates, the passivation layer (22) and by establishing electrical continuity between the counter electrode (CE) and the uncovered part of the contacts (20) via the outside of the contact pads (12). Application to the production of liquid-crystal display screens.

Method for embodying a display cell in which : 

a counter-electrode (CE) is placed on a first transparent 
plate (P1), 
a polymerizable glue cord (10) is placed on the circumference of 
the counter-electrode, 
contact blocks (12) are placed on the counter-electrode outside 
the glue cord (10) at appropriate locations, 
addressing lines (L) and columns (C) and pixel electrodes (Px) 
are placed on a second plate P2), 
counter-electrode connection contacts (10) are formed at the 
periphery of this second plate (P2), 
a non-conducting passivation film (22) is placed on this second 
plate (P2) and, apart from other elements, covers the counter-electrode 

contacts (20), 
the two plates (P1, P2) are assembled, the contact blocks (12) 
carried by the first plate (P1) being disposed above the counter-electrode 

contacts (20) carried by the second plate (P2) but remaining 
separate from the latter v ia the passivation film (22), 
the glue (10) of the cord is polymerized, 
at least one portion of the passivation film (22) coating the 
counter-electrode contacts (20) is removed around the assembly of the 

two plates, 
an electric continuity is established between the counter-electrode 
(CE) and the uncovered portion of the contacts (20) via the outside of 

the contact blocks (12). 
Method according to claim 1, wherein : 

a silver paste is used for producing the contact blocks (12) 
the assembly is annealed so as to polymerize the silver paste (12) 
after polymerizing the glue cord (10) 
the cell is filled  
 
the passivation film (22) is etched outside the assembly which 
frees the extremity of the counter-electrode contacts (20), 
a second silver paste (12') is applied to the contact blocks (12) 
and to the freed extremity of the counter-electrode contacts (10), 
this second silver paste (12') is polymerized. 
Method according to claim 2, wherein the passivation film (22) is 
etched by plasma under vacuum. 
Method according to claim 2 or 3, wherein : 

a first large plate (40) is embodied comprising several counter-electrode 
patterns (42) and also a second large plate (50) having the 

same number of sets of electrodes (52) with counter-electrode contacts 
(54) and a passivation film 
polymerizable glue cords (44) are disposed on the first large 
plate (40) around the counter-electrode patterns (42), 
contact blocks (46) are placed on the first large plate (40), 
the two large plates (40, 50) are assembled, 
the glue of the cords (44) is polymerized, 
the method is is cut so as to obtain individual cells, 
the method is continued for each individual cell obtained.
