<ABSTRACT>
A modular shoulder prosthesis for the replacement of a portion of the humerus is provided. The prosthesis is assembled from a kit (10) that includes a stem (20a, 30b) sized to be received in the humerus, a body (30a, 30b) sized to replace a portion of the humerus, the body (30a, 30b) being attachable to the stem (20a, 20b), and a head member (44a, 44b, 44c) sized to replace the head of the humerus, the head member (44a, 44b, 44c) being eccentrically attachable to the body (30a, 30b). A collar (59a, 59b, 59c) is inserted between the head member (44a, 44b, 44c) and the body (30a, 30b) to help stabilize the assembled prosthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to prostheses for
replacement of a portion of the shoulder joint. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a modular
prosthesis for replacement of the upper portion of the
humerus.Conventional prostheses for the replacement of
the upper portion of the humerus are typically unitary
structures, generally including a stem designed to extend
downwardly into a cavity within the humerus. The stem of
the conventional prostheses is secured within the bone of
the humerus by bone cement or through the use of coatings
that promote bone ingrowth to secure the stem. The stem is
attached to a body portion designed to replace portions of
the humerus in the vicinity of the anatomical neck of the
humerus. The conventional shoulder prosthesis also
includes a generally spherical head portion configured to
replace the head of the humerus. A collar is generally
provided between the head portion and the stem to stabilize
the prosthesis on the resected humerus. Generally, the
collar rests on the resected surface of the humerus to
distribute imposed loading on the prosthesis over a greater
area of bone.One difficulty with conventional unitary shoulder
prostheses is the necessity of maintaining large
inventories of differently sized prostheses to accommodate
the different bone sizes of prospective patients. With
such unitary shoulder prostheses, the patient is typically
evaluated by x-ray to determine the approximate prosthesis
size needed for bone replacement. A number of differently
sized prostheses are selected as possible candidates for
bone replacement on the basis of this evaluation, and the 
final selection of the appropriate prosthesis is selected
during the replacement operation.Fully or partially modular prostheses that
diminish the problem of maintaining a large inventory are
known for use as femur replacements. For example, U.S.
Patent 4,051,559 discloses a prosthesis that includes a
separate threaded stem that is adapted to be screwed into a
prepared cavity within the femur. The prosthesis
separately comprises a head portion that includes a neck
and collar that is adapted to be mated with the stem. This
prosthesis is not designed to be assembled prior to
insertion within the patient. The stem must first be
screwed into the cavity within the femur. The head portion
is then attached to the installed stem by a bolt. The
collar is designed to rest upon the resected surface of the
femur to support the load placed on the prosthesis.
Because of the design of the stem, the head

<CLAIMS>
A kit for the assembly of a modular shoulder
prosthesis for the replacement of a head, neck, and

adjacent portions of a humerus, the kit comprising

at least two stems (20), with each stem (20)
sized for insertion into the humerus,
at least two bodies (30), with each body (30)
sized to replace a portion of the humerus, and with each

body (30) configured to receive in fixed attachment one
of the at least two stems (20),
at least two head members (44), with each head
member sized to replace the head of the humerus, and
means for eccentric attachment of each of the at
least two head members (44) to any of the at least two

bodies adapted to allow adjustable superior/inferior and
anterior/posterior positioning of the head member

relative to the body.
The kit of claim 1 further comprising at least
two collars (56), with each collar (56) configured for

positioning between one of the at least two bodies (30)
and one of the at least two head members (44) so that the

collar (56) can increase stability of the assembled
modular shoulder prosthesis. 
The kit of claim 1, wherein at least one of
the stems (10) is attached to at least one of the bodies

(30) with external threads (28) defined on the at least
one stem (20) and internal threads (33) defined in a bore

(32) in the at least one body (30) for threaded
engagement of the stem (20) and the body (30).
The kit of claim 1, wherein the means for
attaching one of the at least two head members to one of

the at least two bodies further comprises a lock finger
excentrically attached to one of the at least two head

members, the lock finger being configured to fit in a
corresponding bore of one of the at least two bodies

(30).
The kit of claim 4, wherein the bore (36) of
the body (30) is formed to define a locking socket (37)

having a non-circular cross section and the lock finger
(45) further comprises a lock element (49) configured to

fit in the locking socket (37).
The kit of claim 5, wherein the cross section
of the locking socket (37) is polygonal.
The kit of claim 6, wherein the cross section
of the locking socket (37) is hexagonal, so that the head

member (44) can be positioned relative to the body (30)
in one of six possible orientations. 
The kit of claims 2 and 4, wherein the collar
(56) is formed to define a central opening sized to

permit passage therethrough of the lock finger (45).
The kit of claim 1, wherein at least one of
the stems (20) is configured to present a bond ingrowth

surface to facilitate long-term attachment of the stem
(20) in the bone cavity.
The kit of claim 1, wherein at least one of
the stems (20) further comprises frangible means (21) for

limiting torque application to the stem (20), the
frangible means (21) configured to break and prevent

further tightening of the stem (20) upon application of a
predetermined amount of torque acting to tighten with

threaded engagement of the stem (20) and the body (30).
