<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hollow industrial robot which is 
especially suitable for process work such as spot and arc 

welding, sealing, painting, glueing, laser machining, etc. 
The robot comprises a tubular lower robot arm (2), the lower 

end of which is pivotably journalled in a robot stand around 
a preferably horizontal first axis and rotatably journalled 

around a second axis (B) coinciding with the longitudinal 
axis of the arm (2). A tubular upper robot arm (5) is articulately 

connected to the upper end of the lower robot arm 
(2) via an articulated joint member (6) in the form of a tubular 

sleeve obliquely cut off at both ends. The articulated 
joint member (6) is journalled in the lower robot arm (2) 

and is rotatable about a third axis (C) which intersects 
said second axis (B). The upper robot arm (5) is journalled 

in or on said articulated joint member (6) and is rotatable 
about a fourth axis (D), which intersects said third axis 

(C). The upper end of the lower robot arm (2) is secured to 
a first conical toothed wheel (9), which engages with a second 

conical toothed wheel (10) secured to the rear end of 
the upper robot arm (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an industrial robot according to
the precharacterising part of claim 1.A robot of that kind is hollow and therefore especially suitable
for process operations such as spot and arc welding,
sealing, painting, glueing, laser machining, etc. With hollow
robots the accessibility in narrow spaces becomes especially
good by the possibility of drawing process cables inside
the robot. Further, the internally drawn cables result
in very high performance of the robot, since the uncontrollable
tossing motions, which may occur in externally arranged
cables at fast movements of the robot tool, need not be
taken into consideration.Industrial robots according to the preamble of claim 1 are previously known, for
example from EP-A-O 299 551. In the robot design described
in that document, the driving units for all the arm and
wrist movements are arranged in the robot foot and connected
to their respective members through a plurality of coaxially
arranged, rotatably journalled tubular shafts. At a given
diameter of the inner cable channel, a relatively large outer 
diameter of the robot arms is inherent in this design,
which deteriorates the accessibility in narrow spaces.
Another drawback with this known design is that the upper
robot arm cannot be swung in a vertical plane upwards and
then backwards. Therefore, the robot requires relatively
large space in the lateral direction if it is to pick up objects
or carry out work operations on the back of the robot.
This is a disadvantage especially in such applications where
it is desired to place several robots close to each other
for simultaneously carrying out, for example, welding operations
in a production line for car bodies.Hollow robot wrists, suitably for use in robots of the type
to which the invention relates, are previously known, for
example from US-A 4 690 012. A hollow motor/gear package for
rotation of the tool attachment rotatably journalled in the
wrist is previously known from US-A-4 997 413.The invention aims at developing an industrial robot of the
above-mentioned kind which does not suffer from the above-mentioned
drawbacks of comparable, previously known designs.
The new robot design is intended to make possible the installation
of several robots of this design relatively close
to each other, for example, along a production line to simultaneously
carry out, for example, welding operations on
car bodies without interfering with each other.To achieve this aim the invention suggests an industrial robot
according to the introductory
