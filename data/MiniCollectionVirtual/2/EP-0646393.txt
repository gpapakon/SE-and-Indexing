<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an exercising device, in particular for training the muscles of, and moving, the lower limbs, the exercising device exhibiting a framework body having at least two foot rests, the foot rests being fastened movably on the framework body by means of a pin and moving up and down in opposite directions about a common pivot point. In order to produce the opposite up-and-down swinging movement of the foot rests, the latter are each supported with respect to the framework body via a pumping cylinder. The pumping cylinders are provided with a gas-channelling connection, with the result that, with the reciprocating up-and-down movement of the foot rests and of the pumping cylinders, gas exchange between the cylinders can take place. The movement of going upstairs can be copied by means of the exercising device. By changing the cross-section surface area of the gas-channelling connection between the pumping cylinders, it is possible to vary the resistance and/or the force expenditure during the up-and-down swinging movement of the foot rests.
