<ABSTRACT>
A corn-based mixed diet comprises rumen-protected lysine, rumen-protected 
methionine and an appetizer preferred by the dairy cows, which 

makes it possible to obtain a stable and high milk production from a 
dairy cows. A method for stably producing a high yield of milk 

comprises the step of feeding to dairy cows in the course of the 
lactation period (1) a corn-based mixed diet containing rumen-protected 

lysine, rumen-protected methionine, an appetizer preferred by the dairy 
cows and a corn-based diet or (2) rumen-protected lysine, rumen-protected 

methionine and a corn-based diet, an appetizer being 
contained in one member selected from the group consisting of the rumen-protected 

lysine, rumen-protected methionine and corn-based diet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a corn-based mixed diet 
comprising rumen-protected lysine (hereinafter referred to as "RPLys"), 
rumen-protected methionine (hereinafter referred to as "RPMet") and 
appetizer having a flavor which meets the dairy cow's taste, and a 
feeding method for dairy cows with the diet. Investigations have been made hitherto for the purpose of 
improving the dairy cow breed and developing diets for the dairy cows in 
order to increase the milk production and to improve the milk qualities 
such as proteins and fats contained in the milk. As a result, high-yielding 
dairy cows capable of producing 7500 kg or more of milk a year 
and, particularly, those capable of producing 10,000 kg or more of milk 
a year were bred. Protein balance attracted attention in increasing 
the milk production and keeping good health of dairy cows, and after 
investigations of them, American NRC standard was established. In 
order to keep the milk production stable while keeping a high quality 
thereof, various nutritive substances and at least one of protein 
sources such as grains, fish meal and blood meal are incorporated as 
additives for grass into the dairy cows diet. However, such protein 
sources do not always meet the dairy cows' taste and the intake of such  
 
additives poses a problem of a load in the metabolism of the diary cows. 
Thus the administration of protein by feeding easily available protein 
sources is not always helpful to the efficient milk production. Investigations were made for the purpose of direct 
administration of the amino acids constituting the protein under these 
circumstances. However, when the amino acids are directly mixed in the 
diet and given to the dairy cows, most of them is degraded in the rumen 
of cows before they reach into the small intestine where they are to be 
absorbed, and thus the purpose cannot be attained. Thereafter, rumen-protected 
amino acids (RPAA) were developed, which are prepared by 
coating the amino acids with a protecting agent so that they are not 
degraded in the rumen and the amino acids are reached and exposed in the 
small intestine. In particular, RPMet (rumen-protected methionine), 
RPLys (rumen-protected lysine) and RPMet & RPLys (rumen-protected 
methionine and lysine) are known. As for the causal relation between the milk quality and the 
amino acids, it was found from the infusion experiments in which the 
amino acids are directly infused into the small intestine via duodenal 
cannula that especially methionine and lysine
