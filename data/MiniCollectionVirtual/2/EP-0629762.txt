<ABSTRACT>
A counterbalanced window operator includes a 
housing (11) in which operating arms (7,8) pivotally 

connected in the housing and slidingly and pivotally 
connected to a sash of the window are counterbalanced 

by a torsion spring (13). In one embodiment, connections 
between the torsion spring and the operating arms are 

adjustable in order to vary the counterbalancing force 
applied to the operating arms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a window operator
for opening and closing a window having a generally
rectangular main frame and a generally rectangular sash
mounted for pivoting movement relative to the main frame
about a pivot axis generally parallel to a pair of
opposed sides of said sash, comprising an essentially
closed housing which is fixed with respect to said main
frame, at least one arm connected at a first end with
one of the said opposed sides of the sash and pivotally
connected at a second end with a pivot point which is
stationarily located inside said housing, and means
arranged inside said housing for moving said arm about
the pivot point, said moving means comprising a
rotatable drive member journalled for rotation in said
housing and a rotatable transmission member operatively
connected with said arm and being engaged by said drive
member to be rotated upon rotation of said drive member
whereby to cause said arm to pivot about said pivot
point, torsional spring means being operatively connected
between a first point fixed with respect to said
housing and a second point engaging a part of said arm
for providing a counterbalancing
force counteracting a weight component of the window.A window operator of this kind is known e.g. from
US-A-5,179,803 and serves for moving a window between
closed and open positions, for example, a window having
a stationary main frame mounted in a roof of a house or
other building, especially a sloped roof, and a sash
hinged to the main frame at the top of the sash for
pivoting toward and away from the main frame.Such operators are typically mounted on a bottom
member of the main frame and connected to a bottom
member of the sash for pushing the sash away from the 
main frame and drawing the sash into engagement with the
main frame. When the window operator is actuated to move
the window in an opening direction, it must overcome a
component of the weight of the sash, especially when the
window is mounted in a roof. In order to overcome this
difficulty, counterbalancing spring means is provided
to counteract the weight component of the window and,
thereby, reduce the force which must be applied to the
operator, either by hand or by a power unit.Such counterbalanced window operators are also
known from US-A-5,097,629 and US-A-2,698,173. The prior
art counterbalanced window operators are characterized,
however, by having fairly large housings to accommodate
the springs or by springs taking up considerable space
outside the housing.According to the invention a

<CLAIMS>
A window operator for opening and closing a
window having a generally rectangular main frame and a

generally rectangular sash mounted for pivoting movement
relative to the main frame about a pivot axis generally

parallel to a pair of opposed sides of said sash,
comprising:


an essentially closed housing (11) which is fixed
with respect to said main frame,
at least one arm (7,8) connected at a first end
with one of the said opposed sides of the sash and

pivotally connected at a second end with a pivot point
which is stationarily located inside said housing (11),

and
means arranged inside said housing for moving said
arm about the pivot point, said moving means comprising

a rotatable drive member (1) journalled for rotation in
said housing and a rotatable transmission member (3,4)

operatively connected with said arm and being engaged
by said drive member (1) to be rotated upon rotation of

said drive member whereby to cause said arm to pivot
about said pivot point, torsional spring means (13)

being operatively connected between a first point (14)
fixed with respect to said housing (11) and a second

point engaging a part of said arm
for providing a counterbalancing force counteracting a

weight component of the window, 
characterized
 in that
the part of said arm engaged by said second point is

disposed outside said housing, and that means (27,28)
are provided for displacement of said second point in

the longitudinal direction of said arm (8) for adjusting
said counterbalancing force without dismantling said

housing.
The window operator of claim 1, 
characterized

in that said torsional spring means comprises a torsion 
spring (13) secured about a stationary pin (14) in said

housing, said torsion spring (13) having a finger
(15,16) slidably engaging said arm part in said second

point.
The window operator of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that said second point is formed by a shoe
member (24) which is slidably displaceable in the

longitudinal direction of said arm.
The window operator of claim 3, 
characterized

in that said displacement means comprises a series of
holes (27) distributed in the longitudinal direction of

said arm (8) and a mounting member (28) fitting releasably
in any of said holes and having a bore (29)

adapted to slidably receive an end of said finger of
said torsion spring.
The window operator of any of claims 1 to 4,

characterized
 in that said first end of said at least
one arm is adapted for sliding connection with the sash

of the window, whereas said pivot point is provided at
a second end of said arm and located in said housing.
The window operator of any of claims 1 to 5,

characterized
 by two of said arms.
The window operator of claim 6, 
characterized

in that the pivot points (12a) for said second ends of
said two arms are located close to each other in a

central part of said housing.
The window operator of claims 2 and 7, 
characterized

by a single torsion spring (13) having two of
said legs (15,16), each of said legs engaging a respective

one of said arms (7,8), said stationary pin (14)
being arranged between said pivot points.
The window operator of claim 6, 
characterized

in that the pivot points (12b) for said second ends of
said two arms are located remote from each other at

opposite ends of said housing (11a). 
The window operator of claim 7 or 9, 
characterized

by individual torsion springs (23) for each of
said two arms (7,8), each of said torsion springs having

a second finger (25) engaging a stationary part (26) of
said housing (11).
The window operator of any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that said moving means further
comprises a manually manipulatable member (2) connected

to said drive member (1) for manual rotation of said
drive member.
The window operator of any of claims 6 to 10,

characterized
 in that said moving means further comprises
an electrically powered drive unit (14) connected

to said drive member (1) for rotating said drive member.
The window operator of any of claims 6 to 10,

characterized
 in that said drive member comprises a worm
member (1) and said transmission member comprises two

separate gears (3,4) engaging said worm member at
diametrically opposed sides thereof, each of said gears

being operatively connected with a respective one of
said arms (7,8) through a link member (5,6) pivotally

connected with said gear and said arm.
The window operator of claim 1, 
characterized

in that said second point is slidable along said part
of said arm.
