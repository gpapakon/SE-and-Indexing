<ABSTRACT>
A prefluxed, flux retaining aluminium-based component is provided comprising a solidified coating layer having flux particles firmly embedded into the coating layer. A method for producing such components comprises steps of applying a molten metallic coating to an aluminium-based component, maintaining the coating in a molten state, driving flux particles against the coating, and cooling the component to solidify the coating and thereby fix the particles firmly in the solidified coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of providing particle 
retaining metal surfaces and more particularly to fluxing of 
aluminium-based components in order to make possible intimate 
wetting of their surfaces through removal of oxide films from the 
surfaces in a subsequent joining of the components and to the 
resulting flux retaining metal components. When aluminium or aluminium alloy (hereinafter both are 
denominated as "aluminium-based" so as to indicate the possible 
use of either) components are assembled, for example into a 
structure like a heat exchanger, they are conventionally fluxed 
prior to brazing in ambient air or neutral atmosphere such as 
nitrogen. Fluxes are employed to disrupt/remove a fine film of 
aluminium oxide readily formed on the aluminium surface. This oxide film interferes with processes for applying a metallic 
coating to the surface as well as processes for joining the 
components by soldering, brazing or welding. The oxide film has 
to be removed and its reformation prevented in order to establish 
the metal-to-metal bonds. Many alternative fluxes are conventionally used to eliminate the 
oxide layer. Chloride-based fluxes break up the oxide film, but 
must be subsequently rinsed away due to their hygroscopic and  
 
corrosive nature. Fluoride-based fluxes, e.g. mixture of 
potassium tetrafluoroaluminate and hexafluorotripotassium 
aluminate, are advantageous since they leave no corrosive 
residues. A flux is normally suspended in water or another solvent, and 
coated onto surfaces of aluminium-based components by spraying or 
dipping. The flux application is normally part of an on-line 
process immediately prior to the joining operation. Conventionally, 
flux application inherently requires an additional step of 
drying in order to remove water or solvents from the components 
prior to heating to a brazeable temperature at which a brazing 
metal melts and the flux is active in order to join together two 
components. Such drying, however, disrupts the efficiency of the 
on-line process. Furthermore, fluxing of the assembled components does not ensure 
a uniform distribution and access of the flux to the whole 
surface of the joined components. An alternative method obviating use of a drying step is electrostatic 
deposition of dry flux powder upon the components prior to 
brazing. The electrostatic deposition is, however, inadequately 
bonded or adherent to permit storage or significant transportation 
of the components for any significant period of time prior 
to
