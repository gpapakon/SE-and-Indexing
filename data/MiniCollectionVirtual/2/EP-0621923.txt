<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water driven turbines for 
hydroelectric generating plants and the like. More 
particularly, this invention relates to water flow 
transition apparatus which reduces water surging in the 
draft tube and vibration of the turbine. In such 
turbines, the turbine blades are provided on a rotary 
member known as a runner. US-A-4017211 discloses one such 
runner for a Francis turbine. In the design of water turbines, it is customary to 
provide a draft tube to conduct water from the turbine to 
the tail race. A transition member is commonly provided 
to channel flow of water from the turbine blades to the 
draft tube and to minimize surging and turbulence in the 
water flow. Such a transition member is usually in the 
form of a tapered hub mounted on the turbine runner or on 
the shaft supporting the turbine runner. The 
configuration of the transition member, runner, and draft 
tube is established in an effort to obtain a steady flow 
of water at an optimum loading of the turbine. In 
practice, however, water turbines must often be operated 
over a wide range of loads. It is observed that surging 
of water can take place in the draft tube leading to 
vibration in the turbine especially when the turbine is 
operated over a range of loads. While the turbine and 
draft tube may be designed for smooth operation at a 
design capacity, a change in load requires more or less 
water flow than the flow at design capacity and may lead 
to undesirable surging and vibration. Such an unstable 
condition is commonly associated with the formation of a 
"vortex rope" which extends into the draft tube from the 
turbine runner. In a Francis turbine operating under 
ideal conditions, water leaves the runner blades without 
any  
 
significant rotating velocity and will move down the draft 
tube without significant swirling motion. If the turbine is 
operated at less than the optimum load, a swirling flow will 
occur in the draft tube with the rope rotating in the same 
direction as the runner. If the load is higher than optimum, 
a rope is produced which rotates in the opposite direction 
from the runner. Those conditions lend to water surges 
in the draft tube and vibration in the turbine. Various measures have been proposed or tried in an 
effort to overcome such surges. It is possible, for example, 
to avoid operating a hydraulic turbine in the load 
range where surges occur. Such a step produces significant 
operating problems. Likewise, redesign of the turbine 
blades or modification of the water
