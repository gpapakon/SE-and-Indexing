<ABSTRACT>
A method of identifying the presence of a known target sequence in nucleic acid contained in a fixed cellular or subcellular biological structure. By adding a stable, reporter-labeled RecA/single-stranded probe complex to the cellular or subcellular structure, the target sequence can be effectively labeled by in situ hybridization, allowing the target sequence to be visualized histologically and microscopically or detected by in situ cytometry or cell sorting flow techniques.
