<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to stable, liquid allophanate-modified 
diphenylmethane diisocyanates, processes for their production 

and use, particularly their use in reaction injection molding processes. 
The stable, liquid MDI of the present invention has an NCO content of 12 

to 32.5% and is the reaction product of an aliphatic alcohol and an 
isomer composition of diphenylmethane diisocyanate comprising from 2 

to 60% by weight 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and less than 6% by 
weight of the 2,2'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and the rest being 4,4'-diphenylmethane 

diisocyanate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid diphenylmethane 
diisocyanates (MDI) and to processes for their production and use. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to liquid, alcohol-based, 
allophanate-modified diphenylmethane diisocyanate prepolymers, 
methods of making these diisocyanates and methods of using these 
diisocyanates, particularly in reaction injection molding (RIM) processes. Liquid diphenylmethane diisocyanates and their use in 
reaction injection molding processes are generally known in the art. U.S. 
3,644,457 discloses room temperature stable liquid isocyanates derived 
from one mole of diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 0.1 to 0.3 mols of 
poly-1,2-propylene ether glycol. U.S. 4,055,548 discloses liquid isocyanate prepolymer 
compositions obtained by reacting polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate 
containing from about 65 to 85 percent by weight of methylene 
bis(phenyl)isocyanate with a polyoxyethylene glycol having molecular 
weight of from 200 to 600 in an equivalent ratio of 0.0185 - 0.15:1. U.S. 4,115,429 and 4,118,411 disclose low temperature (as 
low as -5°C), storage stable liquid diphenylmethane diisocyanates which 
are produced by reacting diphenylmethane diisocyanates having a 
specified 2,4-isomer content with propylene glycol or poly-1,2-propylene 
ether glycol.  U.S. 4,261,852 discloses liquid polyisocyanate compositions 
comprising (a) the reaction product of 90 to 50% by weight of a reaction 
product of diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a polyoxypropylene diol or 
triol having a hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 750 to 3000, said 
reaction product having an NCO content of from 8 to 26% by weight, and 
(b) from about 10 to 50% by weight of a diphenylmethane diisocyanate 
containing from 30 to 65% by weight of diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 
the remainder being polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate. U.S. 4,490,300 discloses room temperature stable liquid 
isocyanates which are derived by reacting diphenylmethane diisocyanate 
with an aliphatic diol having a pendant aromatic group, e.g., 2-methyl-2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol 
or phenyl-1-2-ethanediol. U.S. 4,490,300 discloses room temperature stable liquid 
isocyanates which are derived by reacting diphenylmethane diisocyanate 
with monoallylether of trimethylolpropane. U.S. 4,738,991 discloses organic polyisocyanates 
characterized by allophanate linkages which are prepared by reacting an 
organic polyisocyanate including 2,4- and 4,4-methylenediphenyl 
diisocyanate with poly- or monohydric alcohol in the presence
