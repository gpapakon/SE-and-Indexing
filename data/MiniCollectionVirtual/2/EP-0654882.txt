<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve a process for monitoring moving elements, in particular windowpanes and sliding roofs in motor vehicles, in order to ensure protection against items being trapped, such that an object which is trapped is reliably detected, the force acting on said object is kept as small as possible and the windowpane movement direction is reversed as quickly as possible, a turn-off threshold is composed of a constant element and a variable element, the switching signal being made effective or being left ineffective as a function of the magnitude of the difference (Dn) between the turn-off threshold and the most recently determined value of the revolution time (tu).

A process for monitoring movable elements, in particular discs driven by an electric 
motor (1) or sliding roofs in motor vehicles, for the purpose of ensuring protection from 

squeezing, wherein 

the time of revolution (tu) and the direction of rotation of the electric motor (1) are 
detected using sensors (8), 
within position intervals (Ii) with a length dependent on the position of the movable 
element within the frame structure, the last determined value of the time of 

revolution (tu) is compared in an evaluation unit (2) with a cut-off threshold and at 
least one switching signal is given, and wherein 
a switching element (5) is triggered by the switching signal causing disconnection or 
reversal of the electric motor (1), 
 
characterised in that. 


the cut-off threshold is applied to the time of revolution (tu) at the start of each 
interval (Ii) and consists of a constant portion and a variable portion which is an 

empirically determined range of values between the minimum and the maximum 
deviation of the time of revolution (tu) from the ideal value during uninterrupted 

closing, wherein the switching signal is made operative or left inoperative as a result 
of the level of the difference (Dn) between the cut-off threshold and the last 

determined value of the time of revolution (tu). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the difference (Dn) in a 
compensation range (Kb), a checking range (Üb) and a cut-off range (Ab) is subdivided, 

wherein the time of revolution (tu) affects the switching signal adversely within the 
compensation range (Kb), generates a signal within the checking range (Üb), which 

signal causes the immediate restart of an interval (Ii+1) within actuation, and affects the 
switching signal positively within the cut-off range (Ab). 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that changes of the time of 
revolution (tu) caused by fluctuations of the supply voltage are detected. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the variable 
portion of the cut-off threshold is calculated from a linear function.  

 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the cut-off 
threshold is only blended in during actuation at the points at which the time of revolution 

(tu) leaves the compensation range (Kb). 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the length of the 
interval (Ii) at the start and at the end of actuation differs from the length of the normal 

interval. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a microcomputer 
(2) is used as an evaluation unit. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the momentary and 
the preceding measured value is required to evaluate the difference (Dn). 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the cut-off 
threshold for protection from squeezing is disconnected during actuation on reaching a 

block range. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that during 
initialisation the sensors (8) detect that the movable element has reached its final 

position, and the microcomputer (2) stores the final position as a reference to calculate 
the boundaries of the block range. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the block range 
starts at the point at which there is no clear opening between the movable element and 

the frame structure.
