<ABSTRACT>
A target plate assembly (77; 124; 213) completely covers and 
seals against a top opening of a sputtering processing 

chamber (69; 138). Cooling liquid connections are provided 
only from the perimeter of the target assembly (77; 114; 

213). When a top vacuum chamber (109; 114) seals the side 
opposite the pressure chamber (69; 138), the pressure on both 

sides of the target assembly (77; 114; 213) is nearly 
equalized. Large thin target assemblies, such as large flat 

plates used for flat panel displays can be sputtered 
effectively and uniformly without adverse sputtering effects 

due to target deflection or cooling deficiencies. 
A target (79; 127; 181), target backing plate (80; 128; 171), 
and cover plate (95; 125 126; 197) may form the target plate 

assembly (77; 124; 213). The sputtering target assembly (77; 
124; 213) includes an integral cooling passage. A series of 

grooves (70; 96; 149; 172) are constructed in either the 
target backing plate (80; 128; 171) or the target backing 

cooling cover plate (95; 125; 126; 197), which are then 
securely bonded to one another. The sputtering target (79; 

127;181) can be a single monolith with a target backing plate 
(80; 128; 171) or can be securely attached to the target 

backing plate (80; 128; 171) by one of any number of 
conventional bonding methods. Tantalum to titanium, titanium 

to titanium and aluminum to titanium, diffusion bonding can 
be used. 
The energized target assembly is protected from adjacent 
components by overlapping insulators (117, 134; 210, 216, 

133) to prevent accidents and isolate the target assembly 
from other components. An electrical connection to the 

target assembly (77; 124; 213) remains unconnected until a 
vacuum is produced in the top chamber (109; 114).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a target assembly, especially to an integrated 
sputtering target assembly. Sputtering describes a number of physical techniques commonly 
used in, for example, the semiconductor industry for the deposition of thin films of 
various metals such as aluminum, aluminum alloys, refractory metal silicides, gold, 
copper, titanium-tungsten, tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum and less commonly 
silicon dioxide and silicon on an item (a substrate), for example a wafer or glass 
plate being processed. In general, the techniques involve producing a gas plasma 
of ionized inert gas "particles" (atoms or molecules) by using an electrical field in 
an evacuated chamber. The ionized particles are then directed toward a "target" 
and collide with it. As a result of the collisions, free atoms or groups of ionized 
atoms of the target material are ejected from the surface of the target, essentially 
converting the target material to free atoms or molecules. Most of the free atoms  
 
which escape the target surface in the direction of the substrate, strike the substrate 
without intervening collision, and form (deposit) a thin film on the surface of the 
object (e.g. wafer, substrate) being processed, which is located a relatively short 
distance from the target. One common sputtering technique is magnetron sputtering. When 
processing wafers using magnetron sputtering, a magnetic field is used to 
concentrate sputtering action in the region of the magnetic field so that target 
sputtering occurs at a higher rate and at a lower process pressure. The target itself 
is electrically biased with respect to the wafer and chamber, and functions as a 
cathode. Objectives in engineering the cathode and its associated magnetic field 
source include uniform erosion of the target and uniform deposition of pure target 
material on the wafer being processed. During sputtering, if magnets generating a 
magnetic field are stationary at a location, then continuous sputtering quickly 
consumes the sputtering target thickness at that location and generates hot spots at 
the locations of sputtering. Therefore, the magnets are usually continuously moved 
over the back of the target during its sputtering. Nonetheless, non-uniform wear 
patterns persist. To avoid contaminating the process, sputtering is stopped before 
the non-uniform sputtering wear pattern has consumed the full thickness of the 
target material at any point. If any point on the target plate behind the target were 
to be reached, sputtering of the
