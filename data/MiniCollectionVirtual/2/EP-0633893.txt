<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 17-substituted steroids and their
use in the treatment of androgen-dependent and
oestrogen-dependent disorders, especially prostatic cancer and
breast cancer respectively.The 17α-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase enzyme complex (hereinafter
"hydroxylase/lyase") is known to be essential for the
biosynthesis of androgens and oestrogens. In the treatment of
androgen-dependent disorders, especially prostatic cancer, there
is a need for strong inhibitors of hydroxylase/lyase. Certain
anti-androgenic steroids are well known, for example Cyproterone
acetate (17α-acetoxy-6-chloro-1α,2α-methylene-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione).
Many other steroids have been tested as
hydroxylase/lyase inhibitors. See, for example, PCT Specification
WO 92/00992 (Schering AG) which describes anti-androgenic
steroids having a pyrazole or triazole ring fused to the A ring
at the 2,3- position, or European Specifications EP-A 288053 and
EP-A 413270 (Merrell Dow) which propose 17β-cyclopropylaminoandrost-5-en-3β-ol
or -4-en-3-one and their derivatives.It has now surprisingly been found that steroids lacking a
C20 side chain and having a 17-(3-pyridyl) ring in its place,
together with a 16,17-double bond, are powerful hydroxylase/lyase
inhibitors, useful for the above-stated purposes.According to the invention, there are provided compounds of
the general formula 

wherein X represents the residue of the A, B and C rings of a
steroid, R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 - 4
carbon atoms, R14 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or
an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and each of the R15
substituents independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl
or alkoxy group of 1-4 carbon atoms, a hydroxy group or an
alkylcarbonyloxy group of 2 to 5 carbon atoms or together
represent an oxo or methylene group or R14 and one of the R15
groups together represent a double bond and the other R15 group
represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon
atoms, and R16 represents a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, or an
alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in the form of the free bases
or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.The term "steroid" herein includes any compound having the
steroidal B and C rings, but in which all or part of the A ring
is missing e.g. ring not closed (lacking the 2- or 3-position
C-atom or both) or takes the form of a cyclopentane ring. It
also includes azasteroids having a ring nitrogen atom in place of
a ring carbon atom, especially in the A-ring such as in
4-azasteroids
