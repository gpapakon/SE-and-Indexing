<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a material for medical use
and a process for preparing the same, and more detailedly,
a material for medical use which is applicable to an
artificial organ and an artificial viscus, furthermore,
which is applicable as a wound covering material, a wound
prosthetic material, a wound curing material, a post-operative
adhesion-preventing material and the like, and a
process for preparing the same.It has been known long that, when a living tissue has some
disorders, is damaged, or has dysfunction, an artificial
material is used for replacement, prosthesis, or prevention
of adhesion of damaged parts, and it has been
conventionally investigated to use a synthetic high
molecular material or a material originating from a living
body for vessels, air tubes, esophagi, valves, various
viscera, and wounds. Such a material for medical use is
required to satisfy various requirements that it has an
affinity for a living body; it has a compatibility with
body fluids such as blood, or tissues; it has neither 
toxicity nor antigenicity; and it has a mechanical strength
as predetermined depending on the implant site.Generally, a material originating from a living body may
possibly cause disorders associated with implantation or
immunological responses, but a collagen, a material
originating from a living body, is excellent in affinity
for a living body and tissue-compatibility, possesses low
antigenicity, a facilitating activity on elongation and
proliferation of host cells, as utilized as a medium for
cell culture, and a styptic activity. It also has an
excellent property as a material for medical use since it
is completely absorbed in a living body. However, when the
collagen only is used, it is difficult to form therefrom a
material which has a high invading ability into cells and a
high proliferating ability for host cells, and also has a
considerable mechanical strength. Therefore, the collagen
has been conventionally used as a composite material with a
synthetic high molecular material.Such a composite material for medical use is produced by
forming a covering layer of collagen comprising an
alkaline-solubilized collagen or an enzyme-solubilized
collagen, having reduced antigenicity, on a surface of the
synthetic high molecular material comprising a silicone, a
polytetrafluoroethylene, a polyethylene, a polypropylene, a
polyethylene terephthalate, a polyurethane, a polyvinyl
alcohol and a nylon in the form of film, sheet, woven
fabric, non-woven fabric, tube, sponge and the like, by
