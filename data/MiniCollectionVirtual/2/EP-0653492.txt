<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for separating individual 
microorganisms either from a support such as soil 

particles to which they are adhered or from a flock in 
which the microorganisms are adhered together to form 

groups. The process involves enzymatically decomposing 
the natural polymeric adhesive which holds the 

microorganism to the support or to one another. After 
the individual microoganisms have been separated, they 

can be counted, or the proportion of one of the 
microorganisms within the microorganism population can 

be determined, or nucleic acids can be separated from the 
microorganisms. The enzyme may decompose 

polysaccharides, proteins or pectins and mixtures of 
enzymes may be used. Suitable enzymes for bringing about 

the separation of the individual organisms comprise 
cellulase, hemicellulase, glucuronidase, amylase, 

protease and pectinase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for separating
into individuals microorganism populations adhered to a
carrier or to other microorganisms. The invention
further comprises collecting separated microorganisms
either as a precipitate or suspended in a liquid, and
performing various operations on these microorganisms.
Such operations can include counting the total
microorganisms present, estimating the population of a
particular type of microorganism as a proportion of the
total, and separating DNA material from the individual
microorganisms.There is a demand for separation of individual
microorganisms from suspensions of soil, from activated
sludge in sewage plants, from waste water disposal tanks
or mud at the bottom of a river, lake or the sea. In
each such environment there is a large population of
microorganisms of different kinds, and there is a
requirement to be able to study these organisms and to
extract the nucleic acid contained in them not only for
fundamental studies in genetic engineering but also for
their utility in various applied technological fields. The process which has been mainly used up until now to
bring about microorganism separation has involved forming
a suspension of the microorganism-containing material in
a suitable buffer solution and painting the suspension
onto an agar culture medium containing appropriate growth
materials. The plate is cultured and after growth has
occurred, a colony of the microorganism which it is
intended to study is selected, further cultured to a high
concentration and then precipitated by centrifugal
separation and collected. However, even though there may
be a useful microorganism present in a suspension being
sampled, it may not be successfully recovered by the
above procedure. Only a small proportion of the
microorganisms present in the suspension is actually
collected for smearing onto the plate and 99 - 99.9% of
them remain attached to the soil or activated sludge or
mud in the suspension being sampled. Hyperplasia on the
agar culture medium used makes it difficult to separate
colonies of microorganisms of individual types.
Furthermore, the culturing conditions may not be
appropriate for the growth of all of the microorganisms
present in the original sample, and it is not known in
advance what culturing conditions would suit every
microorganism of interest.In the sampling of activated sludge in water sludge 
disposal tanks, the necessary culture conditions are
relatively well established. However, culturing is
likely to change the
