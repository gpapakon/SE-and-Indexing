<ABSTRACT>
A screen (10) for removing undesirable particles from a liquid 
has a flat parallel array of shute filaments (11) spaced apart less 

than a preselected minimal linear dimension of the undesirable 
particles transverse to a parallel array of groups of 3 to 10 

warp filaments (13), the warp filaments (13) of each group being 
oppositely woven about and between the shute filaments (11) taken 

individually or in pairs to secure the shute filaments (11) and 
maintain the spaces therebetween, the spaces (15) between groups of 

warp filaments being greater than the preselected minimal 
linear dimension of the undesirable particles so that the 

screen (10) is characterized by rectangular flow apertures (15) 
therethrough, the diameter of the shute filaments (11) being in the 

order of at least 1.1 times the diameter of the warp filaments (13) 
so that the apertures (15) have an aspect ratio ranging as great as 

4 to 10 or more, even for filaments having diameter ranging as 
small as .0070 to .0010 inches or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to screens and more
particularly concerns screens used for removing undesirable
particles from a liquid such as oil well drilling fluids.The factors of primary importance in vibrating screens
are particle separation, fluid throughput or conductance and
screen life. Finer particle separation results in a higher
percentage of impurities being removed from the screened
fluid. Higher conductance are desirable because more fluid
can be processed per square foot (one foot is equal to about 30.5cm.) of screen area, thereby
reducing costs. Doubling the conductance doubles the liquid
throughput. Longer screen life saves time and money. Since
the mid-seventies the vibrating screen industry trend has been
to decrease wire diameter in order to achieve higher
conductance. The result has been finer separation and higher
conductance but shorter screen life. In order to increase
screen life, the industry has resorted to various types of
bonded screens such as plastic-backed, metal-backed or bonded-backup,
but bonded screens are more expensive.In order to maintain high conductance and screen life, I
have developed double shute or warp screens which are
described in my U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos.
07/870,486, filed 4/16/92, (US Patent No. 5256291)
and 07/893,715, filed 6/5/92, (US Patent No. 5256292)For a double warp plain weave screen having warp and
shute wires of the same material and properties, the shute
diameter must be at least 1.4 times the warp diameter to
prevent sleaziness. Since the shute diameter controls the
conductance, it the shute diameter is fine enough to give very
high conductance, the warp diameter is so fine that the screen
has a low tensile strength and therefore shorter life.Thus, while the double warp screens described in my 
earlier patent applications provide improved conductance and
life over the previous art, an undesirable compromise between
separation, conductance and life is often necessary for finer
screens having very high ranges of conductance.Coarse triple warp plain weave screens have been used in
the past, ranging from very coarse up to about 50-60 mesh
(50 mesh is a nominal aperture of 0.297mm and 60 mesh is a nominal
aperture of 0.250mm, in U.S. standard sieve series).
The aspect ratios of the rectangular openings of these known
triple warp screens vary from about 4/1 to 10/1 but the ratios
of their shute to warp diameters are 1.5/1 or greater. Use of
these higher diameter ratio screens decreases conductance to
such unacceptable levels that
