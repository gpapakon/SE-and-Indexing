<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rubber compositions
which are quantitatively reinforced with silica. In
one aspect, the rubber composition is comprised of
rubber, particularly sulfur cured rubber, reinforced
with a combination of silica and specified coupling
agent and, optionally, carbon black.For various applications utilizing rubber which
requires high strength and abrasion resistance,
particularly applications such as tires and various
industrial products, sulfur cured rubber is utilized
which contains substantial amounts of reinforcing
fillers. Carbon black is commonly used for such
purpose and normally provides or enhances good
physical properties for the sulfur cured rubber.
Particulate silica is also often used for such
purpose, particularly when the silica is used in
conjunction with a coupling agent. In some cases, a
combination of silica and carbon black is utilized for
reinforcing fillers for various rubber products,
including treads for tires.It is important to appreciate that,
conventionally, carbon black is a considerably more
effective reinforcing filler for rubber products, and
particularly for rubber tire treads than silica if the
silica is used without a coupling agent, or silica
coupler as it may be sometimes referred to herein.Indeed, at least as compared to carbon black,
there tends to be a lack of, or at least an
insufficient degree of, physical and/or chemical
bonding between the silica particles and the rubber
elastomers to enable the silica to become a sufficient 
reinforcing filler for the rubber for most purposes,
including tire treads, if the silica is used without a
coupler. While various treatments and procedures have
been devised to overcome such deficiencies compounds
capable of reacting with both the silica surface and
the rubber elastomer molecule, generally known to
those skilled in such art as coupling agents, are
often used. Such coupling agents may, for example, be
premixed, or pre-reacted, with the silica particles or
added to the rubber mix during the rubber/silica
processing, or mixing, stage. If the coupling agent
and silica are added separately to the rubber mix
during the rubber/silica mixing, or processing stage,
it is considered that the coupling agent then combines
in situ with the silica.In particular, such coupling agents are generally
composed of a silane which has a constituent
component, or moiety, (the silane portion) capable of
reacting with the silica surface and, also, a
constituent component, or moiety, capable of reacting
with the rubber, particularly
