<ABSTRACT>
A thermographic dye transfer image-recording material is provided wherein a particular silver salt complex is employed as a source of silver ions, made available upon imagewise heating, to cleave a dye-providing material to provide a diffusible dye in an imagewise pattern corresponding to said imagewise heating. The silver salt complexes have improved solubility in the system providing for enhanced transferred image density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
thermographic dye transfer image-recording material and 
more particularly to one capable of providing images 
having enhanced image density. It is well known that various cleavage 
reactions are assisted by silver ions including 
reactions involving cleavage of a compound into one or 
more fragments. U.S. Patent No. 3,719,489 discloses silver ion 
assisted cleavage reactions useful in photographic 
systems. As disclosed therein, photographically inert 
compounds are capable of undergoing cleavage in the 
presence of silver ions made available imagewise during 
processing of a silver halide emulsion to liberate a 
reagent, such as, a photographically active reagent or a 
dye in an imagewise distribution corresponding to that 
of said silver ions. In one embodiment disclosed 
therein, color images are produced by using as the 
photographically inert compounds, color providing  
 
compounds which are substantially non-diffusible in the 
photographic processing composition but capable of 
undergoing cleavage in the presence of the imagewise 
distribution of silver ions and/or soluble silver 
complex made available in the undeveloped and partially 
developed areas of a silver halide emulsion as a 
function of development to liberate a more mobile and 
diffusible color-providing moiety in an imagewise 
distribution corresponding to the imagewise distribution 
of said ions and/or said complex. The subsequent 
formation of a color image is the result of the 
differential in diffusibility between the parent 
compound and liberated color-providing moiety whereby 
the imagewise distribution of the more diffusible 
color-providing moiety released in the undeveloped and 
partially developed areas is free to transfer. Color-providing compounds useful in the above 
process form the subject matter of U.S. Patent No. 
4,098,783, a continuation in part of said U.S. Patent 
No. 3,719,489. The color-providing compounds disclosed 
therein may comprise one or more dye radicals and one or 
more 1,3-sulfur-nitrogen moieties. For example, they 
may comprise one complete dye or dye intermediate and 
one cyclic 1,3-sulfur-nitrogen moiety. Alternatively, 
the color-providing compounds may comprise two or more 
cyclic moieties for each dye radical or dye intermediate 
and vice versa. Particularly useful dye-providing 
compounds disclosed therein comprise a dye containing 
from 1 to 4 and preferably 1 or 2 cyclic 1,3-sulfur-nitrogen 
groups and may be represented by the 
formula 
D-[(L)m-1-Y]n
