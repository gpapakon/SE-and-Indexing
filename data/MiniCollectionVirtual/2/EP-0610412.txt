Diffuser for a hair dryer with a diffuser body, which can 
be fixed on an air outlet aperture of the hair dryer, wherein the 

diffuser body has air outlet apertures (12) and a plurality of 
hair grasping elements (9,10,11) which extend away from the 

diffuser body, wherein at least some of the hair grasping 
elements (9,10) are arranged on the diffuser body so as to be 

movable relative to other hair grasping elements (11) from one 
position into a different spatially remote position, 

characterised in that the diffuser body has a positioning device 
which is accessible to the user such as a lever (8), a rotating 

ring (13), a rotating device (24), an actuating ring (34), an 
adjusting means (46) or the like, with which the hair grasping 

elements (9,10) can be moved from one position to another 
position by the user.  

 
A diffuser according to claim 1, characterised in that a first group of hair 
grasping elements (11) is fixed on the diffuser body and a second group of hair 

grasping elements (9, 10) is movable relative to the first group of hair grasping 
elements. 
A diffuser according to claim 1, characterised in that all hair grasping 
elements (9, 10, 11) are movable relative to one another. 
A diffuser according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the movement of at least one group of hair grasping elements (9, 10, 11) yes 

place in a circle with respect to a central axis of the diffuser. 
A diffuser according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the diffuser body comprises an outer shell (1) and an inner shell (3) which is 

rotatably mounted and secured within the outer shell (1). 
A diffuser according to claim 5, characterised in that the inner shell (3) is 
connected to the outer shell (1) by a centre piece (6), the inner shell (3) being 

rotatable round the central axis of the diffuser and the centre piece (6) being 
fastened on the outer shell (1) through apertures in the inner shell (3).  

 
A diffuser according to claims 4 to 6, characterised in that the outer shell 
(1), the inner shell (3) and the centre piece (6) have a substantially circular 

peripheral line, the apertures provided in the inner shell (3) for fastening purposes 
are designed as arc-shaped slots and the rotation of the inner shell (3) is limited 

by the dimensions of the apertures. 
A diffuser according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the hair grasping elements (9, 10, 11) are arranged annularly on the diffuser 

body. 
A diffuser according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
individual groups of hair grasping elements (9, 10) are movable in a circle round 

different axes of rotation allocated to each group. 
A diffuser according to claim 9, characterised in that the inner shell (3) 
has recesses (16) with apertures (17) in which there are rotatably arranged discs 

(18) with hair grasping elements (9, 10) provided thereon. 
A diffuser according to claim 10, characterised in that the discs (18) have 
an axis (19) with a gearwheel (20), the axes (19) being guided by cylindrical 

sleeves (21) which surround the apertures (17). 
A diffuser according to one of claims 9 to 11, characterised in that a 
rotating device (24) with an angled, for example T- or L-shaped cross section is 

arranged between an external peripheral region of the shells (1, 3), one arm (22) 
being directed radially inwardly and having, at its end, internal teeth (23) which 

are arranged so as to mesh with the gearwheel (20) in the interior of the diffuser. 
A diffuser according to one of claims 9 to 12, characterised in that further 
recesses (25) are rotatably arranged on the discs (18) and further discs (26) with 

hair grasping elements (9) are rotatably arranged in these recesses (25).  
 
A diffuser according to claim 13, characterised in that the discs (18) have 
an edge (28) with internal teeth by means of which the further discs (26) provided 

with a toothed external edge (29) can be driven. 
A diffuser according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
individual groups of hair grasping elements (9) are movable radially with respect 

to the central axis of the diffuser. 
A diffuser according to claim 15, characterised in that the diffuser body 
comprises an outer shell (1) and an inner shell (3) and between the shells (1, 3) 

there is rotatably arranged a disc (30) with arc-shaped recesses (32) which rise 
and fall toward the edge of the disc and an edge designed as an actuating ring 

(34). 
A diffuser according to claim 15 or 16, characterised in that, in the radial 
direction, the inner shell (3) has guides with orifices in which strips (36) with hair 

grasping elements (9) are received, rows of hair grasping elements (10) being
