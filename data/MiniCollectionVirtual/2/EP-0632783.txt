<ABSTRACT>
A sealing system of the type in which a locking pin is received in a cavity containing a tooth that cooperates with the pin to prevent withdrawal of the pin. The object of the invention is to provide this type of seal but which is at the same time both of high security and simple to manufacture. In the system of the invention, the cavity (2) has two openings (14, 16) adjacent to each other and separated by the base (17) of the tooth (18). The cavity is otherwise totally closed and its inner wall (21), which extends to the bottom of the cavity, is curved under the base (17) of the tooth. This permits manufacture using an injection mould having a plate (39) provided with a fixed part (40) and a part (41) rotatably mounted on the fixed part to define therebetween the male mould portion for moulding a cavity with a tooth. An actuator (42) serves to rotate the rotary part (41) during opening of the mould, the rotary part (41) having a curved surface (52) corresponding to the curved part of the inner wall (21) of the cavity. Security seals and devices incorporating the new sealing system are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a new sealing system 
suitable for use in security seals and other devices designed 
to seal objects. Many sealing systems are known in which a locking 
pin is received within a cavity or orifice having internal 
teeth for cooperating with and locking the pin, thus preventing 
relative movement between the two parts. However, many 
known drawbacks are associated with seals of this type, for 
example: 
a) although their manufacture is relatively simple, 
those systems that use orifices passing right through the part 
in which they are formed have a generally reduced degree of 
security since access to the teeth is available from the side 
of the orifice opposite that which is penetrated by the locking 
pin;  b) attempts to increase the degree of security of 
systems of type a) above often fail to provide the ideal security 
desired and almost always increase manufacturing costs; 
and c) those systems in which the bottoms of the locking 
pin receiving cavities are closed so as to prevent access to 
the pins after closure are manufactured using injection moulds 
having complex structures subject to all types of malfunction, 
this also increasing the cost of the final product to an inacceptable  
 
level. An example of a seal having a closed cavity is the 
plastic/metal padlock type seal of EPO-A-0 223 905. That seal 
comprises a plastic body formed internally with two closed 
cavities separated by a wall having lateral protuberances behind 
and below which reversely bent prongs of a metal shackle 
element engage for closure of the seal. Such lateral 
protuberances that have the function of internal locking teeth 
have negative surfaces facing the bottoms of the respective 
closed cavities. Although EPO-A-0 223 905 does not relate to, 
nor does it disclose, the manner of manufacturing the seal, it 
is clear that if injection moulding techniques are to be used, 
the presence of the under surfaces of the protuberance require 
the use of an mould having a complex structure with movable 
parts (wedges or the like) that have to move at the beginning 
and end of each injection cycle.  
 The purpose of the present invention is, therefore, 
to provide a high security sealing system that can be manufactured 
using an extremely simple injection mould that is not 
subject to malfunction. According to the present invention, a sealing system 
for a security seal is of the type comprising a first part 
having a cavity containing a tooth and a second part carrying 
a locking pin which, on

said two entry openings (14,16) and an inner wall (21) of the 
cavity extends from the edge (22) remote from said tooth base 

(17) of one (16) of the said entry openings (14,16) to the 
bottom of the cavity (2) which is opposite said entry 

openings, and then to the edge (23) remote from said tooth

wall (21) being curved under said tooth base (17).

(20) that fits into said slot in the sealed configuration. 
Security seal characterised by comprising a sealing 
system according to claim 1 or 2, an elongate flexible 

strip (11) extending from said first part (1) and formed along 
its length with a series of openings (12) axially spaced from 

each other, and hinge means (4) joining said second part (3) 
to said first part (1) to permit said second part to be folded
