<ABSTRACT>
A composition for a rare earth bond magnet consists of rare earth magnet powder and resin ingredient, and a magnet 
whose moldability, performance and corrosion-resistance are improved by adding chelating agent alone or chelating agent and 

antioxidant to the composition. By controlling the values of the material properties of the composition, troubles when molding 
the magnet can be suppressed, and the productivity of the magnet can be improved. With respect to a composition for extrusion 

molding, by using at least two kinds of resin, the moldability can be improved and the amount of production can be increased. 
Further, by using extrusion molding through cooling and setting and using hot compression molding as the manufacturing method 

of the magnet, the magnet is endowed with a high density and a high performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rare-earth
bonded magnet comprising a rare-earth magnetic powder and
a resin component, and more particularly to a rare-earth
bonded magnet having a high volume fraction of magnetic
powder and thus having high performance, a rare-earth
bonded magnet composition for use in the production of the
rare-earth bonded magnet.Rare-earth bonded magnets hitherto been produced by
the following methods.
1. Compression molding2. Injection molding3. Extrusion moldingCompression molding is generally a method wherein
a magnet composition comprising a magnetic powder and a
thermosetting resin is filled into a mold in a press at
room temperature, compressed the composition and heated to
cure the resin, thereby molding a magnet. In the case of
the compression molding method, since the resin content of
the magnet composition is lower than that for the other
molding methods, the freedom of shape in molding a magnet
is smaller although the magnetic properties of the
resultant magnet are superior.Injection molding is a method wherein a magnet
composition comprising a magnet power and a resin component
is heat-melted to prepare a melt having sufficient fluidity
which is then injected into a mold where the melt is molded
into a desired shape. In the case of the injection
molding, in order to impart sufficient fluidity to the
magnet composition, the resin content of the magnet 
composition is higher than that for the compression
molding, resulting in lowered magnetic properties. The
freedom in molding, however, is higher than that for the
compression molding.Extrusion molding is a method wherein a magnet
composition comprising a magnet powder and a resin
component is heat-melted to prepare a melt having
sufficient fluidity which is then formed into a shape in a
die and set by cooling, thereby providing a product having
a desired shape. In the extrusion, like the injection
molding, the resin content needs to be high enough to
impart the magnet composition to fluidity. This method has
an advantage that a thin-walled and long magnet can be
easily produced.Among the above methods, injection molding and
extrusion generally use a thermoplastic resin as the resin.
These are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.
123702/1987, 152107/1987, 194503/1985 and 211908/1985.However, the conventional rare-earth bonded magnet
composition comprising a rare-earth magnet powder and a
thermoplastic resin, used in the prior art methods,
particularly in injection molding and extrusion, has the
following problems.
