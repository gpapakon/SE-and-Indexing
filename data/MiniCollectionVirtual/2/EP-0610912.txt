<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polycarbonate
polymer derived from a novel dihydroxy compound having a triphenylamine
structure and a process for producing the same.
More specifically, the present invention relates to a polycarbonate
polymer of a novel structure having a triphenylamine
structure in a repeating unit, and the polycarbonate polymer is
obtained by reacting a dihydroxy compound having a
triphenylamine structure described hereinbelow and a carbonate
precursor or by reacting the dihydroxy compound, a dihydric
phenol compound, and the carbonate precursor.The polycarbonate polymer of the present invention is
useful as a plastic molding material or as a material for
forming a polymer alloy with other resin.Polycarbonates industrially produced at present are
mostly so-called bisphenol-type polycarbonates produced using
bisphenol A [2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane] as the raw
material. A bisphenol-type polycarbonate is a resin well-balanced
in the physical properties of the resin, such as a
heat resistance, a mechanical strength, etc.Recently, with the increase of the uses of
polycarbonates, polycarbonates having excellent properties have 
been desired and according to the desire, polycarbonates having
various structures have been developed as described in, e.g.,
JP-A-63-108023 and JP-A-64-66236 (the term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application").Furthermore, in the point of physical properties, the
development of polycarbonates having specific properties or
polycarbonates having more excellent properties in connection
with the use field has been strongly desired from markets.Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to
provide a novel polycarbonate having a specific structure and
being useful as a material for forming a polymer alloy with
other resin or as a material for a photosensitive material.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a polycarbonate having a repeating unit derived from a novel
dihydroxy compound having a triphenylamine structure.A still another object of the present invention is to
provide a novel dihydroxy compound having a triphenylamine
structure, which constitutes the polycarbonate of the present
invention.Further object of the present invention is to provide
a process for producing the polycarbonate.The polycarbonate of the present invention is obtained
by reacting the dihydroxy compound having the triphenylamine
structure and a carbonate precursor or by reacting the 
dihydroxy compound, a dihydric phenol,
