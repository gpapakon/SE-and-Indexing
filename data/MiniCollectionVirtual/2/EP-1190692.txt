<ABSTRACT>
A surgical cast cutter for removing orthopedic bandages of
a hard casting material type and a method for applying the cast

on an affected area such that it may be easily removed by the
cast cutter are disclosed.


The cast cutter according to this invention includes a cutting
tool comprising a first shank(2a), cutting portion(2b), and

second shank(2c); a first housing(1) having a built-in rotating
means which rotates said cutting tool; a tool holding means

which rotatably holds said cutting tool(2); a second housing(15)
which receives said cutting tool(2) and having an integrated

horseshoe-shaped protrusion which is inserted between the hard
cover and affected area as a guide such that said hard cover may

be easily cut; and a hood(50) which is coupled to said second
housing(15) and movable in the up and down direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surgical instrument and
particular to a cast cutter for removing orthopedic bandages of
a hard casting material type, and a method for casting the
affected area such that the cast may be easily cut by using the
cast cutter.Various devices and methods to remove a cast from an
affected area of a patient have been developed. For example, an
electric saw having a rotating or oscillating blade has been
used to remove the cast from the affected area of a patient.This electric saw has been proved to be unsatisfactory for
many reasons. In particular, this electric saw often shocks the
patient who is getting the cast removed due to the near approach
of the rotating or oscillating blade against the affected area
and the noise and debris generated when said electric saw
piercingly cuts the cast. These disadvantages occur especially
when the patient is a child.In addition, because of the above disadvantages, cast
cuttings using the electric saw remove the cast from the
affected area by carefully penetrating through the cast such 
that the rotating or oscillating blade does not contact the
affected area and cutting the cast once and then by using a
separate mechanical device for spreading the cut cast open.The reason for this is because of the possibility of shock
to the patient and that the operator must perform the task of
cutting the cast with the electric saw, which requires extreme
caution, twice on two uniform portions of the cast to avoid
using a separate mechanical device to spread the cut cast open,
and this asserts agony for both the patient and the operator.Therefore, the object of the present invention is to
provide a cast cutter which does not apply shock or injury to
the patient when removing the cast from the affected area, and
which is provided with a hood which can be moved up and down
according to the flexion caused from the difference in thickness
of the cast and at the same time collect dust and debris formed
when removing the cast.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
casting method through which the cast cutter according to this
invention may perform the cutting operations easily when
removing a cast from an affected area.To achieve the above mentioned objects, the cast cutter
according to this invention includes a cutting tool comprising a
first shank, cutting portion, and second shank; a first housing
having a built-in rotating means which rotates said cutting 
tool; a tool holding means which rotatably holds said cutting
tool; a second housing

<CLAIMS>
A surgical cast cutter comprising:

a) a first housing(1) extending in the longitudinal
direction, having an opening(12) at the bottom of the front end

which is closed by a stop plate(1a), a motor(3) having a front
axle(4) extending to the front end of said first housing, a

transmission(5) connected to said front axle(4) and which
changes the speed of a first output axle(5a), which is parallel

to said front axle(4), to predetermined revolutions, a second
output axle(11) which is perpendicular to said first output

axle(5a) and passes through said opening(12), a set of bevel
gears(10) which converts rotation centered on said first output

axle(5a) to rotation centered on said second output axle(11) and
which is provided with an integrated cylindrical portion(20) on

the output side, and a third output axle(13) which is connected
to said cylindrical portion(20) in a key connection manner;
b) a second housing(15) including a built-in cutting
tool(2) which is comprised of a first shank(2a), a cutting

portion(2b), and a second shank(2c) and connected to said third
output axle(13) in a key connection manner with interposed

bearings(22,23) on each of said first and second shank, and a
protrusion(16) comprised of a first portion(16a) extending

parallel to said cutting tool(2) and a second portion(16b) which
is integrated with the front end of said first portion(16a) and

extends from the front end of said first portion(16a) in a
perpendicular direction to the cutting tool(2) and having a

second aperture(17) formed thereon;
c) a cascaded first joint(19) to which said stop plate(1a)
is coupled on the top and which the bottom thereof is joined to

the said second housing(15) having threaded portions on the top
outer circumference, and through which the first shank(2a) of

said cutting tool(2) is passed;
d) a second joint(30) of which the top thereof is coupled
to said stop plate(1a) and which the bottom thereof having a

shape corresponding to the cascaded shape of said first
joint(19) in the inner circumference and receiving said first

joint(19);
e) a hood(50) having a threaded aperture formed on the top
portion perpendicular to the cutting tool(2), an L shaped

nipple-type connector(50a) formed on one side, and coupled by a
bolt(54) to the second housing(15) on which a slot shaped

groove(52) is formed on a position corresponding to said
aperture and parallel to said cutting tool(2); and
f) a spring(54) interposed between said second joint(30)
and said hood(50).
The surgical cast cutter of claim 1, wherein said hood(50) is
transparent, the outer surface thereof is a smooth surface, and

all edges are rounded.
The surgical cast cutter of claim 1, wherein a display(50b)
which indicates the cast cutting direction is formed on the

distal end surface of said hood(50).
The surgical cast cutter of claim 1, wherein said second
portion(16b) is plate shaped, and the thickness thereof

decreases from the proximal end to the distal end, and from the
center portion to both ends.
A method of easily performing cutting operations using the
surgical cast cutter according to any one of claim 1 to claim 4

when removing a cast from an affected area comprising the steps
of:


wrapping a cast padding(120) on the affected area(100);
adhering adhesive tape(130) of a smooth surfaced strip
shape on said cast padding under the hard cover(140) portion to

be cut when the hard cover is removed from the affected
area(100) with the hard cover cutter(200); and
wrapping the hard cover(140) on said cast padding(120) on which
said adhesive tape(130) is adhered on a portion thereof.
The method of claim 5, wherein said hard cover(140) is
polyethylene resin.
The method of claim 5, wherein the horseshoe shaped
protrusion(210) of the hard cover cutter(200) is positioned

between said adhesive tape(130) and said hard cover(140) during
cast cutting operations.
