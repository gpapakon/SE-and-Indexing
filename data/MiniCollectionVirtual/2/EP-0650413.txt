<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to means of identification or a document of value comprising a paper or polymer region, in particular, bank notes, passports, identification cards or any other document of sufficient value to make it liable to be copied or counterfeited, wherein a liquid crystal material has been applied to the region to produce optical effects which differ when viewed in transmitted and reflected light. The invention also relates to a method of producing such means of identification or a document of value and a method of verifying the authenticity of an identification means or a document of value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a means of
identification or a document of value comprising a
paper or polymer region, in particular, bank notes,
passports, identification cards or any other document
of sufficient value to make it liable to be copied or
counterfeited.The increasing popularity of colour
photocopiers and other imaging systems and the
improving technical quality of colour photocopies has
lead to an increase in the counterfeiting of bank
notes, passports and identification cards, etc.
There is, therefore, a need to add additional
security features to the identification or document
of value or to enhance the perceptions and resistance
to simulation of existing features. Steps have
already been taken to introduce optically variable
features into such documentation which cannot be
reproduced by a photocopier. There is thus a demand
to introduce features which are discernable by the
naked eye but "invisible" to, or viewed differently,
by a photocopier. Since a photocopying process
typically involves reflecting high energy light off
an original document containing the image to be
copied, one solution would be to incorporate one or
more features into the document which have a
different perception in reflected and transmitted
light, an example being watermarks and enhancements
thereof.It is known that certain liquid crystal
materials exhibit a difference in colour when viewed
in transmission and reflection as well as an 
angularly dependent coloured reflection.Liquid crystal materials have been incorporated
into documents, identification cards and other
security elements with a view to creating distinctive
optical characteristics. EP-A-0435029 is concerned
with a data carrier, such as an identification card,
which comprises a liquid crystal polymer layer or
film in the data carrier. The liquid crystal polymer
is in solid form at room temperature and is typically
within a laminate structure. The intention is that
the liquid crystal layer, which is applied to a black
background, will demonstrate a high degree of colour
purity in the reflected spectrum for all viewing
angles. Automatic testing for verification of
authenticity is described using the wavelength and
polarisation properties of the reflected light in a
single combined measurement. This has the
disadvantage of being optically complex using a
single absolute reflective measurement requiring a
uniform liquid crystal area on a black background.
AU-488,652 is also concerned with preventing
counterfeit copies by introducing a distinctive
optica

<CLAIMS>
A means of identification or a document of value
comprising a translucent or transparent paper region

(1) and a liquid crystal material (3) applied to the
region to produce optical effects which differ when

viewed in transmitted and reflected light,

characterised in that said region incorporates a
cylinder mould watermark (2), and in that the liquid

crystal material has been applied to the paper region
over said watermark.
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the watermark (2) has variations in

material density and/or thickness which produce
variations in optical density.
An identification means or document as claimed in
any of the preceding claims, wherein the liquid

crystal material (3) is in liquid form at room
temperature.
An identification means or document as claimed in
any of the preceding claims, wherein the liquid

crystal material (3) is enclosed within a containing
means.
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 4, wherein the containing means are micro

capsules. 
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 4, wherein the containing means is a laminate

structure.
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 4, wherein the containing means is a honeycombed

structure.
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 4, wherein the containing means is a polymer

film comprising a plurality of voids.
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 4, wherein the containing means are hollow

polymer fibres.
An identification means or document as claimed in
claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the liquid crystal

material (3) is a solid at room temperature.
An identification means or document as claimed in
any preceding claim comprising a laminate, one layer

of which comprises the paper region (1).
An identification means or document as claimed in
any preceding claim, wherein the colour of the light

reflected from the region (1) is the complement of the
colour of the light transmitted through the region. 
An identification means or document as claimed in
any preceding claim, wherein the liquid crystal region

(3) has a pattern of areas of left-handed and right-handed
liquid crystal forms. 
A method of producing a means of identification
or a document of value comprising the steps

of incorporating a translucent of transparent
paper region (1) in the identification means or

document, which region includes a cylinder
mould watermark (2), then applying a liquid crystal

material (3) over said paper region to said
watermark to produce optical effects which

differ when viewed in transmission and
reflection. 
A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the
liquid crystal material (3) is applied in a liquid

form enclosed within a containing means.
A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the
liquid crystal material (3) is applied by a printing

process.
