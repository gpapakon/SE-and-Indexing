<ABSTRACT>
In a cleaning device for textile machines which is movable in the direction of travel, with a suction pipe or suction hose for a region laterally next to the textile machine, which region is contoured and is to be cleaned, there is provision for the suction pipe (12) to have a lower folding portion (14) which can be folded away at least essentially horizontally opposite to the direction of travel (24).

Unidirectionally displaceable cleaning device for textile
machines, with a suction pipe or tube (12) presenting a lower

tilting section for an area laterally next to the textile
machine, the said area having contours and requiring to be

cleaned, characterised in that the lower tilting section (14)
against the direction of travel (24) can at least be tilted

away essentially horizontally in such a way that a suction
opening (38) of the suction pipe (12) is activated.
Cleaning device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the tilting section (14) presents a control surface (26)

facing in the direction of travel (24), which upon impact with
a contour (28) in the area lateral to the textile machine,

initiates the tilting movement about a horizontal axis.
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the suction pipe (12) above the tilting

section (14) and the tilting section (14) of the suction pipe
(12) are connected into each other comparatively stiffly and

to a joint (40).
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a joint (40) between the suction pipe

(12) and the tilting section (14) is formed from an elastic
material (16) with comparatively high self damping, such as

rubber, or similar.
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the suction pipe (12) and the tilting

section (14) are formed as separate parts from each other and 
the suction opening (38) is provided at the end of the suction

pipe (12).
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a joint (40) is provided between the

suction pipe (12) and the tilting section (14) on the rear end
of the suction pipe (12) relative to the direction of travel

(24).
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that several tilting sections (14) are

arranged stacked with, depending on the height of a contour
(28), the tilting section (14) concerned able to be tilted

away together with the tilting sections (14) beneath it.
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a continuous seal extends between the

suction pipe (12) and the tilting section (14), which is
capable of sealing in the partial vacuum occurring in the

suction pipe (12).
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a control surface (26) of the tilting

section (14) which faces downwards or into the direction of
travel (24) is equipped so that it slides easily.
