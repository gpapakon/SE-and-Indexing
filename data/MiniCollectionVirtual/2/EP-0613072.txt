for biassing the cascode current mirror, the cascode current mirror comprising, between 

an input terminal (11) and a supply voltage terminal (14), a first cascoded MOS 
transistor (21) and a first cascode MOS transistor (22) and, between an output terminal

coupled to the gates of the two cascoded MOS transistors (21, 23), a source, and a 

drain coupled to the first supply voltage terminal (13)

cascode MOS transistors (22, 24), a source coupled to the source of the first bias MOS

via
 the 
second bias current source (32), and a third bias MOS transistor (43) coupled between

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrated circuit comprising a cascode current 
mirror, a bias stage for biassing the cascode current mirror, a first supply voltage 
terminal for receiving a first supply voltage, and a second supply voltage terminal for 
receiving a second supply voltage, the cascode current mirror having an input terminal 
for receiving an input current, an output terminal for supplying an output current, a first 
cascoded MOS transistor having a gate coupled to the input terminal, a source coupled 
to the supply voltage terminal, and a drain, a first cascode MOS transistor having a gate 
coupled to the bias stage, a source coupled to the drain of the first cascoded MOS 
transistor, and a drain coupled to the input terminal, a second cascoded MOS transistor 
having a gate coupled to the gate of the first cascoded MOS transistor, a source coupled 
to the source of the MOS transistor 21, and a drain, and a second cascode MOS 
transistor having a gate coupled to the gate of the first cascode MOS transistor, a source 
coupled to the drain of the second cascoded MOS transistor, and a drain coupled to the 
output terminal. Such an integrated circuit, which converts an input current into an output 
current by means of a cascode current mirror, can be utilized in a diversity of chips. Such an integrated circuit is known inter alia from United States Patent 
number 4,618,815. In the known integrated circuit the bias stage comprises a current 
source and a MOS transistor coupled as a diode. Since the current source and the MOS 
transistor are serially coupled between the two supply voltage terminals a current 
generated by the current source produces a voltage across the MOS transistor, which 
voltage is applied between the gates of the two cascode MOS transistors and the second 
supply voltage terminal. As a result of the voltage the two cascode MOS transistors 
and, indirectly, the two cascoded MOS transistors are biassed, which two cascoded 
MOS transistors should be operated in a saturation mode in order to ensure an 
undistorted current transfer of the cascode current mirror. Since the cascoded MOS 
transistors have a drain-source voltage which varies depending upon a current through  
 
the two cascoded MOS transistors, the voltage between the gates of the two cascode 
MOS transistors and the second supply voltage terminal should have value which 
guarantees saturation of the cascoded MOS transistors. As a result, the value of the 
voltage between the gates of the two cascode MOS transistors
