<ABSTRACT>
A vibration isolation apparatus includes a shaft (16) having a first and second end 
(18, 20). A piston (30) having an axial bore is coaxially positioned with the shaft to 

provide a damping passage (32) between the piston and the shaft. A flange (34) extends 
radially from the piston for coupling the apparatus to a load. A first extension (22) is 

coupled to and extends radially from the first end of the shaft and a second extension 
(24) is coupled to and extends radially from the second end of the shaft. Primary bellows 

(50, 52) extending from and secondary fluid paths (26, 28) extending through the first 
and second extensions (22, 24) provide a first volumetric stiffness in series with the 

damper. Secondary bellows (42, 44) connect the flange (34) to the first and second 
extensions (22, 24) and are coaxial with the shaft to provide a second volumetric 

stiffness parallel with the damper and the first volumetric stiffness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of vibration damping and isolation. 
More particularly, the present invention discloses a three parameter viscous damper and 
isolation system. Precision structural systems carrying a load, such as a telescopic system, are 
susceptible to disturbances that can produce structural vibrations. Such vibrations may 
be contributed to the system by components or assemblies of the precision structural 
systems itself, for example, reaction wheel assemblies of the telescopic system. Since 
such precision structures tend to have little inherent damping, these vibrations can lead to 
serious performance degradation. Therefore, an efficient means of damping and isolating 
the load carried by the precision structures in a controlled manner is of considerable 
importance. Both active and passive damping and isolation techniques have been utilized. 
However, active systems suffer from high cost, low reliability and poor low level 
threshold performance. On the other hand, passive systems require no power, are often 
less expensive than active devices and do not drive the structure unstable. Thus, passive 
damping systems have proven to play a significant role in the overall design of precision 
structural systems. One such manner of implementing a passive system includes the use 
of viscous damping and isolation. Viscous dampers and isolators include a fluid 
reservoir sealed in a damping structure which utilizes viscous fluid shear forces to 
provide damping and isolation. One type of viscous damper and isolator, a conventional two parameter system 
10, is shown in the mechanical schematic of Figure 1A. The system includes a damper 
with a damping function CA which could be implemented with a piston moving through 
a liquid in a cylinder. As the piston moves, the damping function is controlled by the size 
of an orifice allowing liquid to pass from one side of the piston to the other side of the 
piston. The orifice may be the clearance between the piston and the cylinder. The 
schematic two parameter system 10 also includes a spring KA, representing a spring 
constant. This spring KA is parallel with the damper CA and a mass M is attached and 
applied thereto. An implemented two parameter system is shown and described in 
US-A 4,760,996 corresponding to EP-A 0 339 113 and in US-A 3,980,358. An  
 
additional two-parameter system is described in the paper entitled, "A MultiAxis 
Isolation System for the French Earth Observation Satellite's Magnetic Bearing Reaction 
Wheel,"
