<ABSTRACT>
A DRAM cell structure comprises a self-aligned surface 
strap (38) between a trench capacitor (10) and a diffusion region (20) 

where the strap comprises polysilicon coated with an electrically 
conductive liner diffusion barrier material (36) in 

order to prevent diffusion from the strap to an active region of 
the device. The preferred diffusion barrier materials are 

TiN and TaN.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polysilicon surface straps 
for use in high density DRAM cells. Specifically, the 
invention relates to a surface strap which is self-aligned 
to the wordline of the cell and which has maximum contact 
area in order to minimize contact resistance. Quite specifically, 
an electrically conductive self-aligned surface 
strap includes a liner diffusion barrier material, preferably 
TiN or TaN, to prevent any dopant from the heavily 
doped strap, from diffusing into the sensitive device 
region of the cell. It is known in the prior art, such as U.S. Patent No. 
5,097,381, that titanium silicide straps may be used on the 
surface of a double sidewall trench capacitor. U.S. Patent 
No. 5,087,588 describes a DRAM cell having a polysilicon 
surface strap for bridging the storage node to the device 
over a dielectric film. U.S. Patent No. 5,065,273 
describes a trench DRAM cell including a polycide strap 
formed by chemical mechanical polishing. U.S. Patent No. 4,897,709 describes the use of TiN in high 
aspect ratio holes such as inside a trench where the TiN 
may be used as a plate. In U.S. Patent No. 5,010,032 TiN is used as a patterned 
interconnect structure in CMOS SRAM between n+ polysilicon 
(silicide) and p+ diffusion (silicide) and between n+ diffusion 
(silicide) and p+ polysilicon (silicide) in order to 
prevent diffusion of dopants and thereby prevent the formation 
of a p-n junction.  U.S. Patent No. 5,001,108 describes a metal-to-superconductor 
barrier layer of TiN to prevent aluminum 
from forming an alloy with silicon. U.S. Patent No. 4,894,693 describes a DRAM cell structure 
where TiN is used as the top capacitor electrode and 
polysilicon is used as the bottom capacitor electrode. The 
TiN is utilized as a conductor as well as a diffusion 
barrier. In U.S. Patent No. 4,804,636 TiN is used as a layer between 
metal and polysilicon. In European Patent Application No. 91109991 a thin barrier 
layer of TiN is described for use as an electric connection 
between a first diffusion region of a MOSFET and the 
storage electrode region of an associated capacitor. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, volume 29, no. 3, August 
1986 pages 1037 and 1038 discloses titanium silicide 
bridging of a trench. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, volume 33, no. 10A, 
March 1991 at pages 260 to 262 discloses a process of 
making a shallow trench isolation self-aligned to a storage 
trench. The present invention concerns a DRAM cell structure comprising 
a self-aligned surface strap
