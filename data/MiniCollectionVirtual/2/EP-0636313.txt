<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals, 
comprises a shed (1), in which the animals can move about 

freely, comprising a milking box (10), a feeding station (4, 
5) and a plurality of resting boxes (2). With the aid of a 

cow identification sensor (14) present in each resting box 
(2), it can at all times be established which animal is 

present in which resting box (2), whilst the resting boxes 
(2) include means (19, 20) for forcing an animal resting in 

this resting box (2) to leave same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction or
a similar arrangement for automatically milking animals, such
as cows, comprising a milking box and a plurality of resting
boxes, the construction furthermore comprising compelling
means.Such a construction is known from NL-A-8104807.In this construction all the animals together are
driven by an electric fence. Sometimes it is favourable to
compel an individual animal.It is an object of the invention to have a
construction of the above defined type wherein it is possible
to compel selected animals in a herd.According to the invention this is achieved in that
a resting box includes the means for compelling the animal
resting in the resting box to leave same and the resting box
includes a cow identification sensor which, together with a
transponder to be carried by the animal, forms part of a cow
identification system, the resting box furthermore includes a
warning member for warning animals not to enter the resting
box, or to warn an animal present in the resting box to leave
same.The construction according to the invention makes
it more certain that a selected animal will be milked at a
predetermined instant, preferably e.g. eight hours, after the
preceding milking. By means of the warning member an animal
can be prevented from entering a resting box, e.g. because an
animal has already left an other resting box with the purpose
of going to the milking box, or because too little time has
elapsed since the previous milking run, so that the teats of
the animal milked have closed or dried insufficiently. The
warning member may be constituted by a computer-controlled
flashing light which, preferably, is screened off in such a
manner that it is not visible in other resting boxes.For the purpose of obviating symptoms of a disease,
more specifically those relating to the udder, to the best 
possible extent, it is advantageous, in accordance with the
invention, for a resting box to be equipped with a
disinfecting unit for disinfecting the area where an animal
has been lying, after it has left the resting box. To that
end, a line may run along the resting boxes for the supply of
a disinfectant, whilst sprayers having a computer-controlled
valve can be connected thereto.In addition, a power supply cable will be run along
the resting boxes as well as a process control cable for the
individual resting boxes. By means of the process control
cables, it will be possible to control from a remote computer
system a warning member and/or expelling member and/or
disinfecting

<CLAIMS>
A construction or a similar arrangement for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a

milking box (10) and a plurality of resting boxes (2), the
construction furthermore comprising compelling means,

characterized in that a resting box (2) includes the means
(20) for compelling the animal resting in the resting box (2)

to leave same and the resting box (2) includes a cow
identification sensor (14) which, together with a transponder

(15) to be carried by the animal, forms part of a cow
identification system, the resting box (2) furthermore

includes a warning member (19) for warning animals not to
enter the resting box (2), or to warn an animal present in

the resting box (2) to leave same.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the warning member (19) is constituted by a computer-controlled

flashing light.
A construction as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that the flashing light (19) is screened off in such a

manner that it is not visible in other resting boxes (2).
A construction as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the flashing light (19) becomes

operative when the animal present in the resting box (2) is
to be milked.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that, if the animal has

not left the resting box (2) a predetermined number of
seconds after the warning member (19) has become operative,

there is triggered an expelling member (20) giving
electroshocks to the animal.
A construction as claimed in claim 5, characterized
in that the intensity of the electroshocks can be increased

automatically.
A construction as claimed in claim 5, characterized
in that the electroshock-producing expelling member (20) is

formed by a freely syspended electric fence (22) wire 
attached via a conical spring to a holder above the relevant

resting box (2).
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 5 to
7, characterized in that the floor of the resting box (2) is

provided with a ground plate (23).
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a resting box (2)

includes a disinfecting implement (27, 28) for disinfecting
the resting area after the animal has left the resting box

(2).
A construction as claimed in claim 9, characterized
in that a line (27) runs along the resting boxes (2) for the

supply of a disinfecting liquid, whilst sprayers having a
computer-controlled valve (28) are connected thereto.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a power supply cable

(24) as well as a process-control cable (25) for the
individual resting boxes (2) are provided along the resting

boxes (2).
A construction as claimed in claim 11,
characterized in that a computer system is present for

controlling via the process-control cables (25) a warning
member (19) and/or an expelling member (20) and/or a

disinfecting implement (27, 28) accommodated in a resting box
(2).
A construction as claimed in any one of the
