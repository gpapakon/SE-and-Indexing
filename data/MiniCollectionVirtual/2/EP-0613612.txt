<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural machine, especially beet harvester, is provided with an ultrasonic device 1, having a transmitter 2 and a receiver 3, for determining the ground clearance. A following evaluation circuit for the signals obtained and a control or regulating device for influencing the operating height of a working appliance are provided. At least two ultrasonic devices 1 are provided offset transversely relative to the direction of travel, their signals together being determinant for the control or regulating device and having the same basic setting. The evaluation circuit is tuned so that the operating height of the working appliance is lowered only when all the ultrasonic devices 1 each emit a signal demanding lowering. The operating height of the working appliance is raised even when only one ultrasonic device 1 emits a signal demanding raising.

<CLAIMS>
An agricultural machine, in particular beet harvester, 
comprising an ultrasonic device (1) for detecting the distance 

to the ground and having an ultrasonic generator (2) and an 
ultrasonic receiver (3), a downstream positioned evaluation 

circuit (10) for the signals received, and a controlling means 
(11, 28) to influence the working height of a working unit (29), 

whereby at least two ultrasonic devices (1) are positioned 
crosswise to the driving direction of the agricultural machine, 

the signals of which determine the controlling means (11, 28) 
and which have the same general adjustment, 
wherein
 the evaluation 
circuit (10) is tuned so that the working height of the 

working unit (29) is lowered only in case all of the ultrasonic 
devices (1) emit a signal each demanding for a lowering, while 

the working height of the working unit (29) is increased if at 
least one ultrasonic device emits a signal demanding a lifting. 
The agricultural machine of claim 1, 
wherein
 each ultrasonic 
device (1) is designed to emit a first signal demanding an 

increase of the working height, a second signal demanding a 
decrease of the working height, and a third signal demanding the 

working height remaining constant. 
The agricultural machine of claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 all of the 
ultrasonic devices (1) are located within the same horizontal 

plane determined by running wheels. 
The agricultural machine of one of the claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 
between two adjacent beet rows there is provided one ultrasonic 

device (1) each. 
The agricultural machine of one of the claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 
three or more ultrasonic devices (1) are provided.  

 
The agricultural machine of one of the claims 1 to 5, 
wherein
 
the ultrasonic devices (1) are located on the agricultural 

machine at right angle with respect to the driving direction. 
The agricultural machine of claim 1, 
wherein
 the working unit 
(29) is designed to handle one or more rows and is guided vertically 

perpendicular to a plane determined by the running wheels. 
The agricultural machine of one of the claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 
each of the ultrasonic devices (1) is surrounded by a reflection 

tube (4), directed to the surface of the ground. 
The agricultural machine of one of the claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 
the controlling means (11, 28) comprises a hydraulic circuit 

(11) having a number of solenoid valves (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) 
and being designed for quick lifting or lowering on the one hand 

and for comparatively slower automatic processing of the working 
height on the other hand. 
The agricultural machine of claim 2, 
wherein
 the range of 
the emission of the third signal of all of the ultrasonic 

devices (1) is commonly defined and may be commonly adjusted.
