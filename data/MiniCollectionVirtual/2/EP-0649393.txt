<CLAIMS>
Process for the reinforcement of a glass object, characterized 
by the prior compression of the surface of said object, an 

acid etching of said surface over a depth equal to or below the 
compressed glass depth and finally a protection of the etched 

surface. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that said protection 
is obtained intrinsically by a thermal or preferably 

chemical tempering treatment. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
protection is obtained extrinsically by depositing a layer of 

the mineral and in particular metallic layer type or an organic 
layer and in particular grafting of a silane. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
object subsequently undergoes a chemical tempering treatment. 
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the prior compression takes place by means of a 

thermal tempering. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the prior compression is performed by means of a 

chemical tempering. 
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the acid etching is performed with the aid of 

an agent containing hydrofluoric acid. 
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that said 
agent also contains surfactants. 
Tempered glass object, whose strength exceeds 200 MPa for a  
 

thickness of 3 mm, with a thickness under compression exceeding 600 µm. 
Chemically tempered glass object, whose strength exceeds 450 MPa, 
with a thickness under compression exceeding 600 µm.
