. The process involves preparing a homogeneous melt containing the components for forming said crystal and a flux comprising oxides of Cs and As at a temperature no higher than the decomposition temperature of said orthorhombic crystal, the mole fraction of M relative to the total Cs+M in the melt being within the range of from 0 to about 0.2; introducing a seed crystal for said single crystal in the melt; activating the controlled crystallization on the seed crystal; and continuing the crystallization until formation of the single crystal is completed. Single crystals of Cs1-xMxTiOAsO4 (including crystals at least about 5 mm x 5 mm 5 mm) are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to single crystals of cesium 
titanyl arsenate and the like and to their preparation, 
and more particularly to larger crystals of cesium 
titanyl arsenate wherein cesium may optionally be 
partially replaced by another monovalent cation and to 
their preparation using flux growth procedures. Crystals of KTiOPO4 and its analogs are considered 
highly useful because of their nonlinear optical 
properties. U.S. Patent 3,949,323 teaches the use of 
flaw-free crystals in the nonlinear optical and electrooptical 
applications. In addition, Sil'vestrova, et al. 
("Piezoelectric, elastic, and dielectric properties of 
RbTiOPO4", Sov. Phys. Crystallogr. 35, 140-141 (1990) 
reported that these crystals should be useful in 
piezoelectric applications. Whereas the growth of large 
inclusion-free single crystal of KTiOPO4, KTiOAsO4, 
RbTiOPO4 and RbTiOAsO4 were successfully demonstrated by 
Cheng, et. al., "Crystal Growth of KTiOPO4 Isomorphs 
from Tungstate and Molybdate Fluxes", J. of Crystal, 
110, 697-703 (1991), the growth of large (e.g., about 
5 x 5 x 5 mm3 or greater) single crystals of CsTiOAsO4 
was unsuccessful using similar flux growth procedures. 
Nevertheless, due to its significantly lower ionic 
conductivity and its ability to efficiently frequency 
double the 1.3 µm line of the Nd:YAG laser, CsTiOAsO4 
continues to be preferred over KTiOPO4 for many device 
applications. Accordingly, processes suitable for the 
growth of large single crystals of CsTiOAsO4 are of 
interest.  
 Crystals of KTiOPO4 and its analogs are known to 
melt incongruently at temperatures from 1100°C to 
1150°C. Flux methods disclosed in U.S. Patents 
4,231,838 and 4,746,396 are commonly used to grow such 
crystals below these temperatures, typically from 850°C 
to 960°C. Hydrothermal methods are also commonly used 
for the production of the crystal KTiOPO4. U.S. Patents 
4,305,778 and 3,949,323, as well as others, teach the 
preparation of KTiOPO4 crystals by these methods. The orthorhombic, Pna21 composition CsTiOAsO4 was 
first reported by Protas and coworkers ("Structure 
Cristalline de CsTiO(AsO4)", Acta Cryst., C45, 
1123-1125, (1989)). Although small crystals of 
CsTiOAsO4 from about a few hundred microns to a few 
millimeters have been synthesized by the aforemention 
methods (see for example, Marnier et. al., "Ferroelectric 
transition and melting temperatures of new 
compounds: CsTiOAsO4 and Cs1-xMxTiOP1-yAsyO4, where M is 
K or Rb," J. Phys.:Condens. Matter , 1,5509-5513 
(1989)), the growth of
