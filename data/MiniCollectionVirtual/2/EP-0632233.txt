<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and an equipment 
for reducing the fog arising from humid exhaust air. 

The air (L₁) that is removed from a room or a 
building or from a process is cooled, and, here-upon, 

mixing air (L₂) is mixed with said exhaust 
air. Hereupon, the partly or fully combined air flow 

(L₁ + L₂) is passed outdoors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and an equipment for reducing the fog arising from 
humid exhaust air. Mixing of an exhaust air that is in the saturated state with the outdoor air almost 
always produces fog. Fog arises when the status point of the air enters into an area 
in which all the humidity contained in the air cannot be accommodated in the air in 
the form of water vapour. The amount of fog that is formed can be reduced by 
cooling the exhaust air. Since the exhaust air still remains in the saturated state, 
occurrence of fog cannot be prevented. 
In the solution in accordance with the present invention, cooled exhaust air is mixed 
with heated outdoor air. This has the effect that the exhaust air is no longer in the 
saturated state. When the exhaust air is mixed with the outdoor air, the humidity can 
be accommodated in the mixture in the form of water vapour if a sufficiently large 
amount of heated outdoor air has been mixed with the exhaust air. In order to 
enhance the effect of the mixing, the exhaust air is first cooled, in which case a 
smaller amount of heated outdoor air has to be mixed. The exhaust air is cooled by 
means of a liquid/air or air/air heat transfer device, and thermal energy obtained 
from the exhaust air is used favourably for heating the outdoor air to be mixed. The method in accordance with the invention for reducing the fog arising from the 
humidity contained in exhaust air is defined in by the features of claim 1. DE-C-413 576 discloses mixing of outside air 
with exhaust air, which is not cooled before mixing.  
 The equipment in accordance with the invention for reducing the fog arising from 
the humidity contained in the exhaust air is defined by the features of claim 3, the preamble of 
this claim being based on DE-C-413 576. GB-A-601 023 discloses an apparatus for extracting 
heat from used air, wherein the air is passed 
through two heat exchangers. In one of these, heat in the used air is transferred to fresh air. In the following, the invention will be described with reference to some preferred 
embodiments of the invention illustrated in the figures in the accompanying drawing, 
the invention being, yet, not supposed to be confined to said embodiments alone. Figure 1A illustrates the mixing of exhaust air and outdoor air in a Mollier diagram 
in a prior-art solution. Figure 1B illustrates the solution in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 illustrates a solution of equipment in accordance with the invention. Fig. 1A illustrates a case in which

) is passed out of the building (R), from its interior space (H), or from a process, 
and a mixing-air duct (13), through which mixing 

air (L
2
) is passed into a mixer unit (14), in which the exhaust air (L

mixing air (L
2
) are mixed partly or fully 
characterized
 in that the exhaust air duct (10) comprises a heat exchanger (11) for cooling the exhaust air (L
