<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds
having antagonism against three endothelin isopeptides
(endothelin-1, endothelin-2 and endothelin-3), which are
physiologically highly active endogenous peptides,
processes for their preparation and their use as a drug,
and 2-cyanotryptophan or a protected compound thereof
which is a key intermediate for preparing the
above-mentioned novel endothelin antagonistic compounds.Two endothelin receptor subtypes ETA and ETB are
known so far. The compounds of the present invention
possess high affinity to at least the ETB receptors,
thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction
induced by the endothelins. The compounds of
the present invention provide a new therapeutic
potential, particularly for the treatment of hypertension,
pulmonary hypertension, Raynaud's disease,
acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, angina
pectoris, cerebral infarction, cerebral vasospasm,
arteriosclerosis, asthma, gastric ulcer, diabetes,
endotoxin shock, endotoxin-induced multiple organ 
failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation,
and/or cyclosporin-induced renal failure or hyper-tension.Endothelin is a polypeptide composed of 21 amino
acids, and it is produced by vascular endothelial cells
of human or pig. Endothelin has a potent
vasoconstrictor effect and a sustained and potent
pressor action (Nature, 332, 411-415 (1988)).Three endothelin isopeptides (endothelin-1, endothelin-2
and endothelin-3), which resemble one another
in structure, exist in the bodies of animals including
human, and these peptides have vasoconstriction and
pressor effects (Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci, USA, 86,
2863-2867 (1989)).As reported, the endothelin levels are clearly
elevated in the blood of patients with essential
hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary
hypertension, Raynaud's disease, diabetes or atherosclerosis,
or in the washing fluids of the respiratory
tract or the blood of patients with asthmaticus as
compared with normal levels (Japan, J. Hypertension, 12,
79, (1989), J. Vascular Medicine Biology, 2, 207 (1990),
Diabetologia, 33, 306-310 (1990), J. Am. Med.
Association, 264, 2868 (1990), and The Lancet, ii,
747-748 (1989) and ii, 1144-1147 (1990)).Further, an increased sensitivity of the cerebral
blood vessel to endothelin in an experimental model of 
cerebral vasospasm (Japan. Soc. Cereb. Blood Flow &
Metabol., 1, 73 (1989)), an improved renal function by
the endothelin antibody in an acute renal failure model
(J. Clin, Invest., 83, 1762-1767 (1989), and
