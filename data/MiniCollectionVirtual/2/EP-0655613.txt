<ABSTRACT>
A temperature measuring device includes an optical fiber (11), 
a metallic protective tube (12) for covering the optical fiber, and 

a heat insulation coating (13) for covering the protective tube. The 
optical fiber is covered with the protective tube and the heat 

insulation coating to form a double-covered optical fiber. The heat 
insulation coating contains particles as an additive having a 

melting point higher than a temperature of a molten metal being 
measured. The heat insulation coating can comprises cellulose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a temperature measuring device,
and more particularly to a structure of the temperature measuring
device.In a continuous casting process, for example, accurate
measurement of temperature and surface level of molten steel during
casting is necessary for improving the product quality and the
production yield. Conventional technology for measuring the
temperature of molten steel in a tundish and a mold prepares a
solidification chamber inside of a carbon sleeve to introduce the
molten steel, and determines the temperature in the solidification
chambre by a contact thermometer of a consumable immersion
thermocouple or a thermocouple covered with a ceramic protective
tube.The consumable immersion thermocouple degrades after only one
measurement cycle because it directly contacts the molten steel.
Therefore, a probe to measure the temperature is detachable at the
tip of the thermometer, and the tip probe is replaced in every
measurement. Since such an expensive probe is discarded at each
measurement, increase of the number of measurement is difficult.In the case that a thermocouple is covered with a ceramic tube,
the thermocouple does not contact directly with the molten steel. 
Consequently, a continuous measurement is possible. In this case,
however, the durability of ceramic protective tube has a limitation
because of heat shock and erosion caused by slag. As a result, an
expensive protective tube is durable only for 50 to 100 hrs., , and
repeated use for a long period is impossible.As a means to solve the problems above described, a consumable
temperature measuring technology was introduced, which technology
uses an optical fiber immersing into a high temperature molten
metal, receives the radiation light emitted from the molten metal to
the optical fiber, and measures the intensity of the radiation
light using a photo-electric conversion element mounted at the other
end of the optical fiber to determine the temperature of the molen
metal. For example, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-19727
is referred.To precisely measure the temperature of molten metal, however,
it is necessary to stably immerse the optical fiber to some depth
into the molten metal. The technology disclosed in the above patent
publication gives a weak strength of optical fiber. In the case
that the optical fiber is covered with an ordinary material such as
TEFLON (trade mark), the covering material catches fire when the
optical fiber approaches the surface of the molten metal, and the
core
