<ABSTRACT>
A dual-mode radiotelephone terminal includes a π/4-shift DQPSK modulator 
(11). A dual-mode modulation is achieved by mixing an output of a 

transmitter oscillator (16) with an output of an offset oscillator (18) to form 
an injection signal (LO) at a final transmitter frequency, the injection signal 

being further modulated with a quadrature modulator in a digital mode of 
operation. In the analog mode of operation the transmitter oscillator or offset 

oscillator is frequency modulated and the quadrature modulator is disabled, 
thereby passing the frequency modulated injection signal without substantial 

attenuation. The LO signal is regenerated and also phase shifted with a circuit 
(35) having a frequency multiplier (30) and a frequency divider (34). The 

circuit outputs two local oscillator (LO) signals (LOA and LOB), each of 
which directly drives an associated quadrature mixer (36, 38) of the 

modulator. In a further embodiment of the invention the dual-mode 
radiotelephone terminal includes a VHF synthesizer (23), a UHF synthesizer 

(21), and a local oscillator (4C) that provides a signal only when operating in 
the analog receiving mode. The local oscillator signal is mixed with a first IF 

signal for providing a second IF signal when operating in the analog receiving 
mode or in a standby mode. The first IF frequency is provided by a standard 

IF filter (45 MHz) when operating in either the digital or the analog mode of 
operation. The output of the VHF synthesizer is divided (22) and used as an 

input to a mixer (4F) that provides a second IF signal when operating in the 
digital receiving mode. A control signal is employed for selectively enabling  

 
and disabling various of these components as a function of the operating 

mode, thereby conserving power.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiotelephones and, in particular, to cellular mobile 
telephones capable of both analog and digital operation. The operation of a dual mode (analog and digital) cellular mobile telephone 
system is set forth in an EIA/TIA Interim Standard entitled "Cellular System 
Dual-Mode Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard" IS-54-B 
(April 1992). The dual-mode EIA standard IS-54-B has features found in the 
conventional analog AMPS system and, in addition, digital voice transmission 
features. A flexible increase of capacity is provided by dividing existing 30 kHz 
bandwidth analog channels into a plurality of digital Time Division-Multiple 
Access (TDMA) channels. As a result, the same cell area can support both 
analog and digital transmission of voice and control or signalling information. 
The preferred implementation of the mobile telephone or terminal is a dual 
operation apparatus which can use analog channels where there is no digital 
support. In addition, the IS-54-B Interim Standard requires that the mobile 
terminal gain access to the digital channel through the analog channel. As a 
result, a dual operation terminal requires all of the functionality of a 
conventional analog mobile terminal, while also requiring digital functionality 
for TDMA digital mode operation.  A preferable solution is to integrate these functions as much as possible, and 
to provide dual-use elements where practical to reduce complexity, weight, 
power consumption, and cost. One significant difference between the analog and digital modes of operation 
is in the modulation required for the transmission of voice and signalling 
information to a base station that serves a cell within which the terminal is 
currently located. The conventional analog terminal employs a frequency 
modulation (FM) of a radio frequency (RF) carrier signal. However, the 
digital terminal requires the use of a π/4-shift differential quadrature phase 
shift keying (DQPSK) modulation technique. These two modulation techniques 
are generally incompatible with one another. One approach to providing a dual-use modulator is disclosed in commonly 
assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,124,672 (E. J. Kuisma). In this approach, analog 
or digital signals are applied to in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) generators to 
form I,Q waveshapes which modulate an intermediate frequency and, upon 
summation, modulate a transmission frequency. Another problem that is encountered when providing a dual-mode mobile 
terminal relates to the receiver
