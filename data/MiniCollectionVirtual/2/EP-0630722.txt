Tool for tightening and undoing an engaged screw 
threaded member (20; 22) having a polygonal profile, of the type 

comprising an operative head of which the section has a basically 
polygonal shape, at least two faces (1) of the section of the head of the 

tool each being formed of two semi-faces of which the operative zones (5, 
8; 5A, 8; 10 to 13; 14, 19) have generally asymmetrical shapes the one 

with respect to the other in relation to the median axial plane of this face 
in such a way that, for a given torque applied to the tool, the stresses 

induced in the tool should be lower in a first direction than in the other 
direction whereas conversely the stresses induced in the threaded member 

are greater in the said first direction than in the other, in such a way as to 

permit the application to the threaded member of a greater torque in the 
said first direction than in the other direction before destruction of the 

head of the tool, characterised in that the said operative zones are 
constituted, for the two directions of rotation, by rounded portions (5, 8; 

14) or sharp ridges (5A; 11; 19) co-operating with flat faces of the said 
polygonal profile. 
Tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
asymmetry defines, in the said first direction, a lever arm (D
d
) greater 
than that corresponding to the other direction (D
s
). 
Tool according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
difference in the lever arms is obtained by a difference in the distance to 

the median axial plane of the two zones of contact and/or by a difference 
in the inclination of these two zones with respect to this plane.  

 
Tool according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the contact of the said face with the profile engaged is achieved by a 

surface (5; 5A; 11; 19) having a radius smaller in the said first direction 
than in the other direction. 
Tool according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
surface of contact in the said first direction is reduced to a ridge (5A; 11; 

19). 
Tool according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it is of an imposed direction of use, in particular of 

the socket type, box spanner, cranked spanner, offset spanner, 
screwdriver, male spanner or male nut, the said first direction being the 

undoing direction. 
Tool according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it is for use in both directions, in particular of the 

ring spanner type, one of the directions favouring safeguarding the 
threaded member and the other direction favouring the capacity for the 

tool to apply increased torques.
