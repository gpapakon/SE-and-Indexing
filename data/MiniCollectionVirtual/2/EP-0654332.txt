<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a panel saw for the varied division of panel-shaped workpieces with a saw (10) comprising a saw unit capable of moving along a cutting line (11). The panel saw comprises at least two workpiece slides (17, 18) movable independently of one another, so that panel-shaped workpiece strips or stacks (12) lying on a worpiece-supporting table (13) side by side can be pushed into the saw (10) for the varied division. A workpiece-removing table (14), following the saw (10) in the workpiece-feeding direction (E), has, adjacent to the cutting line (11), a separating device (20) with at least one separating means (21, 21') which is movable from a rest position into a working position and back, and in its working position acts, for example by means of oblique rollers (22), in such a way on a cut-to-size panel or stack of panels (16') that the latter is displaced transversely with respect to a transporting direction away from an adjacent cut-to-size panel or stack of panels (16). As a result of this, a disruption-free, ordered further-conveyance of the cut-to-size panels or stacks of cut-to-size panels (16, 16') on the workpiece-removing table (14) is ensured, so that the transfer of the cut-to-size panels or stacks of cut-to-size panels to further transporting means can also take place without disruption.

A panel dividing system for patterned dividing of panel-shaped 
workpieces, having a saw (10) which comprises a saw accessory that 

is displaceable along a cutting line (11); having at least two 
workpieces sliders (17, 18, 19) that can be displaced independently 

of one another so that panel-shaped workpiece strips or stacks (12) 
resting next to one another on a workpiece support table (13) can be 

introduced into the saw (10) for patterned dividing; and having a 
workpiece removal table (14), adjoining the saw (10) in the workpiece 

introduction direction (E), which has, adjacent to the cutting line (11), 
a separating apparatus (20) having at least one separating means (21, 

21') that can be moved from an idle position into a working position 
and back and that in its working position acts on a cut panel or panel 

stack (16' or 16'') in such a way that the latter is offset, transverse to 
a transport direction, away from an adjacent cut panel or panel stack 

(16 or 16'). 
Panel dividing system according to claim 1, wherein the separating 
apparatus (20) has a plurality of separating means (21, 21'), arranged 

next to one another transverse to the transport direction of the cut 
panels (16, 16', 16''), which can be brought into their working 

position independently of one another. 
Panel dividing system according to claim 2, wherein each separating 
means (21, 21') is associated with a workpiece slider (17, 18, 19), all  

 
the separating means (21, 21') associated with the same workpiece 

sliders (17, 18, 19) having the same offset action in their working 
position. 
Panel dividing system according to claim 2 or 3, wherein given three 
workpiece sliders (17, 18, 19), the separating means (21') associated 

with the one externally located workpiece slider (19) have an offset 
action, directed away from the center workpiece slider (18), that is 

greater than the offset action, occurring in the same direction, of the 
separating means (21) associated with the center workpiece slider 

(18). 
Panel dividing system according to claims 2 to 4, wherein each 
separating means (21) comprises at least one skewed roller (22, 22'), 

the rotation axis (24, 24') of which lying parallel to the table plane 
(23) encloses an angle with the transport direction of the cut panels 

(16, 16', 16'') that differs from 90 degrees and determines the offset 
action. 
Panel dividing system according to claim 5, wherein each separating 
means (21, 21') comprises a plurality of skewed rollers (22, 22') 

which are arranged one behind the other in the transport direction of 
the cut panels (16, 16', 16'') on a roller bar (21, 21') that can be 

raised and lowered. 
Panel dividing system according to claim 5 or 6, wherein the skewed 
rollers (22, 22') have a working surface which increases friction.  

 
Panel dividing system according to claims 5 to 7, wherein in order to 
increase friction, the skewed rollers (22, 22') are made of rubber or 

another elastomeric material.
