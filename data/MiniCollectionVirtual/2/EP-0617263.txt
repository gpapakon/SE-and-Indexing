<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring device for measuring the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an object. It contains a first detector to which the radiation is fed via an optical system and a second detector to which the radiation coming from a reference element is fed via the optical system. The output signals of the two detectors are processed, whilst forming the difference, in a corresponding device. In this way it is possible largely to suppress the inherent radiation of the optical system.

<CLAIMS>
Measuring device (1, 1') for measuring the electromagnetic 
radiation emitted by an object, particularly a 

pyrometer, with 

a) a first detector (5), 
b) an optical system (4) for delivering the radiation to 
the first detector, 
c) a second detector (6), 
d) a reference element (7, 7') from which emanating 
reference radiation falls onto the second detector, 
e) and a device which processes output signals from the two 

detectors (5, 6) by formation of the difference, 
 
characterised in that
 
f) the two detectors (5, 6), the optical system (4) and the 

reference element (7, 7') are disposed in a housing (3) 
having an inlet opening (2), the reference radiation 

emanating from the reference element (7, 7') being 
passed through the optical system (4) to the second 

detector (6). 
Measuring device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that a device is provided which detects the temperature of the 

reference element (7, 7'). 
Measuring device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that detectors which are sensitive to 

alternating light can be used as first and second detectors 
(5, 6).  

 
Device as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that an 
optical modulator (8) which has at least one radiation-permeable 

and one radiation-impermeable region is provided in 
the beam path between the optical system (4) and the detectors 

(5, 6). 
Measuring device as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in 
that the radiation-impermeable region (modulator disc 9) of 

the optical modulator (8) has a substrate material made from 
polyethylene terephthalate which is coated with a metal 

material both on the side facing the radiation and on the side 
facing away from the radiation. 
Measuring device as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the optical modulator (8) can be driven 

by means of a miniature rotary stepping motor (10). 
Measuring device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that detectors which are sensitive to 

constant light can be used for the first and second detectors. 
Measuring device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a digital/analogue converter (11) 

which is disposed after the device which processes the output 
signals from the two detectors (5, 6), the said converter 

comprising 

a reference source (U
Ref
), 
at least two adjacent switching stages (12a, 12b, 12c, 
12d) with at least one resistance (R
1
, R
2
) and a switch 
(13a, 13b, 13c, 13d) 
and a current/voltage converter (14) which produces an 
output signal (U
a
), 
  
 

the ratio between adjacent switching stages being smaller than 
1 : 2.
