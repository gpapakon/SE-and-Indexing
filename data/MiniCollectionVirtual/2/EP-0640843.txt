<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic resonance imaging capable of decreasing 
ghost-like artifacts peculiar to a fast SE method etc. so that an 

image exhibiting high image quality is obtained. A magnetic 
resonance imaging apparatus, as one aspect, having an arrangement 

that one exciting pulse (90°) is supplied to a subject of an inspection 
placed in a static magnetic field so that a desired sliced plane is 

excited and then a plurality of refocusing pulses (180°) are sequentially 
supplied to the sliced plane so that an image is reconstructed in 

response to a plurality of spin echo signals (R1, R2, R3, R4) generated due to 
energization caused by the plurality of refocusing pulses. The 

magnetic resonance imaging apparatus further includes an 
acquisition order changing unit for changing the order of levels of 

phase encoding, to which the plurality of spin echo signals are 
subjected, at each radio frequency excitation using the exciting 

pulse, a receiving unit for receiving the spin echo signals on which 
the phase encoding gradient pulses (G

accordance with the acquisition order are applied, and a data 

arranging unit for arranging the echo data in the Fourier space 
correspondingly to the acquisition order.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1 and apparatus for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a nuclear magnetic
resonance phenomenon, and more particularly to an imaging method
and apparatus employing a multi-echo scanning method capable of
performing a high speed scanning operation.A variety of sequences for acquiring image data in magnetic
resonance imaging have been employed at present. As one of the
foregoing methods, a spin echo method (an SE method) is available
which uses 90°-pulses (excitation pulses) and 180°-pulses
(refocusing pulses).As one of spin echo methods, a single echo scanning method
has been known. The single echo scanning method has an
arrangement that one 90°-pulses is supplied, and then one 180°
-pulse is supplied after time TE/2 (TE: a predetermined echo time)
has passed so as to acquire one spin echo signal generated in
response to the supplied 180°-pulse. The foregoing collection
process is repeated by the times corresponding to the required
number of matrices. The echo time TE is set to be, for example, TE
= 80 msec to 120 msec in a case where the static magnetic field is
0.5 T.Also a multi-echo scanning method (hereinafter called a "fast
SE method") for shortening the scan time has been known as one of 
the variety of spin echo methods. The fast SE method uses CPMG
pulse trains or CP pulse trains and, as shown in Fig. 1, supplies one
90°- pulse and a plurality of 180°- pulses. As a result, one radio
frequency excitation operation in accordance with one 90°- pulse
generates a plurality of echo signals R1 to R4 (in a case where a 4
-echo method is employed). The echo signals R1 to R4 are
respectively subjected to phase encoding using gradient field GE
having different intensities. The foregoing sequence is repeated
several times so that echo data required to reconstruct one image
is collected by the number of excitation operations that is smaller
than the number required for the usual SE method. As a result, an
advantage can be realized in that the time required to complete the
scan can significantly be shortened.The fast SE method is characterized in that a series of echo
data items obtained from one radio frequency excitation operation
using one 90°- pulse are, as shown in Fig. 2, arranged in direction
Ke (in a direction of the spatial frequency of phase encoding) at the
same intervals in the k space (the Fourier space).However, the foregoing fast SE method raises a problem of
ghost generation caused from the movement of a subject to
