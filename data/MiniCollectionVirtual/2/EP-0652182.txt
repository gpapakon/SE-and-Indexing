<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to fields of public 
pollution and hygiene and it concerns an ozone reaction 
apparatus used generally for the treatment of various kinds 
of waste water and service water such as discoloration, 
deodorization and sterilization of waste water. Various techniques of using ozone, for example, for 
discoloration, deodorization and sterilization of waste 
water have been developed. The purpose of such treatments 
is attained by the ozone reaction technique of dispersing 
ozone-containing air generated from an ozone generation 
device (hereinafter referred to as ozonized air) into 
polluted water by using a dispersing device such as an 
aeration device and utilizing the oxidizing power of ozone 
dissolved in water. In the ozone reaction technique of the prior art, 
ozonized air containing a lean ozone generated from an 
ozone generation device is merely dispersed in water and 
ozone reaction is taken place based on the solubility of  
 
ozone and air in water as the rate of determination. However, since a probability of collision between a 
small amount of ozone molecules dissolved in water and 
particles suspended in polluted water to be treated is 
low, collision between the ozone molecules and the target 
particles seldom occurs in the reaction operation by existent 
diffusion devices such as an aeration device, and this 
necessitates the use of a great amount of ozonized air for 
attaining the purpose of the treatment and, accordingly, a 
great amount of unreacted ozone is produced. Therefore, it is necessary to adsorb unreacted ozone 
by using a great amount of adsorbents such as activated 
carbon with a view point of protecting human bodies against 
toxic unreacted ozone or additionally provide two or three 
units of ozone reaction apparatus in order to reutilize 
the unreacted ozone, which results in a problem of increasing 
the running cost and enlarging the scale of the 
facility. It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention 
to provide an apparatus capable of remarkably decreasing 
the amount of produced unreacted ozone to such an extent 
as not requiring adsorbents such as activated carbon thereby 
effectively utilizing ozone, while taking a notice on the  
 
physical property of ozone and by simple procedures in a 
small-scaled apparatus by virtue of highly excited reaction 
by dynamically separating ozone from air and causing it to 
collide directly with polluted water in an extraordinarily 
disturbed state. The foregoing object of the present invention
