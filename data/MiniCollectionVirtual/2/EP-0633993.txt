<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating a fluid control system and a distribution valve thereto. The fluid control system comprises a heat source (1) for a heat medium and several distribution valves (6) for distribution of heat medium to several heat consumers (8). Cold return heat medium from each heat consumer is returned to the heat source via a pump (10). To each distribution valve is transmitted warm heat medium from the heat source and cold return heat medium, which are mixed in the distribution valve in accordance with the heat requirement of the corresponding heat consumer. The fluid flow to each heat consumer is constant and is adjusted at the installation of the fluid control system. Thence, the fluid flow is maintained constant ant the mixture ratio is adjusted independent of the fluid flow. This means that the fluid flow pump will work under constant flow leading to constant pressure over the pump. A distribution valve is provided having the mixture ratio between input cold and warm fluid adjustable and the flow through the valve adjustable independent of each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid control system for distribution of a heat 
medium to several parallel heat consumers and a method of operating the same. A floor heating system is often used instead of a radiator heating system in heating 
domestic houses and industrial buildings etc. In previous radiator systems, such radiators are often placed at the wall below each 
windows. In a floor heating systems such radiators are replaced by heating hoses or tubes 
positioned in the floor. Such a floor heating system is often regarded as more comfortable 
because it locates the heat where it is needed, at the lower part of the rooms. Moreover, a 
floor heating system is inherently a low temperature system, which lends itself to operation 
by heat pumps, thus saving costs for heating. The system according to the invention is also 
suitable for use together with gas burners, which also operate at low temperature and other 
similar systems. A floor heating system comprises several hoses or tubes positioned in the floor 
structure, or below the floor. Such a floor heating member for each room is controlled by a 
valve for maintaining the heat medium in the member in accordance with the heat 
requirements of the room. Often, several valves for several rooms are gathered in a central 
panel and distribution lines transport heat medium from the valves in the panel to the 
intended room. Such floor heating members are often connected in parallel to a circulation pump 
and a heat source. However, such a parallel system of valves is difficult to control since the 
adjustment of one valve influences upon the heat transfer in a heating member of an adjacent 
valve. It is very important to balance the system in advance so that such adjustments are 
minimized. The US-A-4 907 739 discloses a hot water centra heating system wherein the amount of heated fluid recirculated to the heat transfer means is controlled by the position of a valve. The object of the present invention is to suggest a fluid control system in which 
such parallel connected valves can be adjusted independent of each other without influencing 
upon each other. These and other objects forming the basis of the present invention are obtained with the method according to claim 1 and the fluid control system according to claim 3. An advantageous embodiment of the invention is 
claimed in the dependent claim. The invention is described in more details below by means of preferred 
embodiments and with reference to the appended drawings, in which Fig. 1 is

heating circuit by a heat source and feeding warm heat 
medium from the heat source to at least two distribution 

valves connected in parallel in said heating circuit, 

characterized by
 the steps of feeding an output flow of 
heat medium from each distribution valve to a heat consumer 

corresponding to each distribution valve, said heat 
comsumers being connected in parallel in said heating 

circuit,

a common return line having a common pump, 
feeding cold heat medium from said common return 
line, after passing said pump, to said distribution valves, 
mixing warm heat medium from said heat source and 
cold heat medium from said common return line in each 

distribution valve the resulting mixed heat medium forming
