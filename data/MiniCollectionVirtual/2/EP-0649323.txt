<ABSTRACT>
A port catheter, designed to be implanted by puncturing, has a cylindrical casing (1) in which there is a chamber (22) closed off on one side by a membrane (4) which can be punctured by an injection needle and connectable on the other side to a catheter (8). Securing loops (9, 10) project from the casing (1) and can be folded together by special means during insertion and unfold when the means are released. The securing loops (9, 10) are made of spring wire surrounding the casing (1) at two separate points. The securing loops (9, 10) are thus relatively stiff in the securing direction but can be bent circumferentially about the casing (1) and held in this position for implantation.

Port catheter comprising a substantially cylindrical 
housing (1), in which is situated a chamber (22) closed 

at one side by a membrane (4), which can be pierced by an 
injection needle, and connectable at the other side 

through connecting means to a tube catheter (8), a cone 
(7) at the end of the housing (1) facing away from the 

membrane (4) for the implantation of the catheter through 
a puncture, two anchoring loops (9, 10), which project 

from the outer wall of the housing (1) and may be folded, 
and means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10) in the 

folded state, characterised in that the anchoring loops 
(9, 10) are formed by a spring wire which is coiled round 

the housing (1) at a first location, extends from it, 
away from the housing (1), on two mutually opposite sides 

in the form of two anchoring loops (9, 10) and returns 
back to the housing (1) at a second location, which is 

axially spaced from the first location, and is there 
coiled again round the housing (1). 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that, to make the two anchoring loops (9, 10) foldable, 

they are bendable round the housing (1) in the direction 
of coiling round. 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10) 

are formed by a fork (26) having two prongs (24, 25) 
which hold together the ends of the folded anchoring 

loops (9, 10), and that the fork (26) has a handle (27) 
or a filament fixed to the fork, which extends out beyond 

the end of the housing (1) facing away from the cone (7).  
 
Port catheter according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the ends of the prongs (24, 25) are somewhat bent 

towards each other. 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10) 

are formed by a filament (28) on end of which loops over 
the ends of the two folded anchoring loops (9, 10) and is 

held together by a bowknot (30), which may be released by 
the other end of the filament (28) which extends out 

beyond the end of the housing (1) facing away from the 
cone (7). 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops are formed 

by a filament (31) one end of which is fixed to one of 
the anchoring loops (10) and that the other end of the 

filament (31) is passed thorough an eye (33) at the end 
of the other anchoring loop (9) and then passes out 

beyond the end of the housing (1) facing away from the 
cone (7). 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10) 

are formed by an axial groove (34) in which are engaged, 
in the folded state, the ends of the anchoring loops (9, 

10), and that a filament (35) is attached to the coils 
(17, 18), particularly in the region where they are 

coiled round the housing (1), the filament (35) extending 
out beyond the end of the housing (1) facing away from 

the cone (7) and by means of the filament the anchoring 
loops (9, 10) may be pulled out of the axial groove (34). 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10)  

 
are formed by a cylindrical ring (36) which surrounds the 

folded anchoring loops (9, 10) and is made of a material 
which is absorbed after implantation of the port 

catheter. 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10) 

are formed by a tube (37, 38) which surrounds the folded 
anchoring loops (9, 10), extends beyond the end of the 

housing (1) facing away from the cone (7) and may be 
pulled off therefrom. 
Port catheter according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the tube (38) is made of a material which may be 

torn in longitudinal direction. 
Port catheter according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the end of the tube (38) surrounding the folded 

anchoring loops (9, 10) is in the region of the anchoring 
loops (9, 10) inwardly folded back. 
Port catheter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for holding the anchoring loops (9, 10) 

are formed by an insertion sleeve (11) known per se which 
can be slid over the housing (1) beyond the folded 

anchoring loops (9, 10) and projects beyond the end of 
the housing (1) facing away from the cone (7). 
Port catheter according to claim 12, characterised 
in that the two anchoring loops (9, 10) form the arms of 

a V which is open in the direction to the cone (7). 
Port catheter according to claim 12 and 13,
