<ABSTRACT>
A machine tool comprises a travelling column, a headstock traversable on the travelling column, and a tool magazine. Tool holders are stored in the tool magazine and can be put individually into a transfer position (38). Two gripper arms (40a, 40b) serve to convey the tool holders between the transfer position (38) and a working position (36) in the spindle. The orientation of the tool holders is retained in the process. The gripping arms (40a, 40b) are separately mounted on the headstock and can be pivoted simultaneously and in opposite directions along locus curves between the transfer position (38) and the working position (36) by hands (57a, 57b) for holding the tool holders. The transfer position (38) and the working position (36) lie in a common vertical plane (68). The transfer position (38) is located in the area of the travelling-column front side pointing towards the headstock. The tool magazine extends from a rear side of the travelling column through a tunnel in the travelling column up to the transfer position. The locus curves run in the area between the positions (36, 38) at a lateral distance from the vertical plane (68).

A machine tool comprising a traveling column (26) that 
can be moved along a horizontal main axis (Y); a spindle 

head (31), with a rotatable spindle (35) that can be moved 
on the traveling column (26) along a vertical main axis 

(Z); a tool magazine (46, 47) in which a plurality of tool 
holders (37a, 37b) is stored and can be brought individually 

into a transfer position (38, 38'); and comprising two 
gripper arms (40a, 40b) to convey the tool holders (37a, 

37b) between the transfer position (38, 38') on the tool 
magazine (46, 47) and a working position (36, 36') in the 

spindle (35) while retaining the orientation of the tool 
holders (37a, 37b), such that the gripper arms (40a, 40b) 

are separately mounted on the spindle head (31) and can 
be pivoted simultaneously and in opposite directions along 

locus curves (100a, 100b) with hands (57a, 57b) to hold 
the tool holders (37a, 37b) between the transfer position 

(38, 38') and the working position (36, 36'), characterized 
in that the transfer position (38, 38') and the working 

position (36) lie in a common vertical plane (68) extending 
in the Y-direction, that the transfer position (38, 38') 

is located in the region of the front side (44), facing 
toward the spindle head (31), of the traveling column (26), 

that the tool magazin (46, 47) extends from a rear side 
of the traveling column (26), through a tunnel (45) in 

the traveling column (26), to the transfer position (38, 
38'), and that in the region between the positions (36, 

36', 38, 38'), the locus curves (100a, 100b) run at a 
lateral distance from the vertical plane (68). 
The machine tool of claim 1, characterized in that the 
transfer position (38) is located above the working position 

(36).  
 
The machine tool of claim 1, characterized in that the 
transfer position (38') is located below the working 

position (36'). 
The machine tool of one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the tool magazin (46, 47) comprises 

a storage area (46, 46') arranged on the rear side of the 
traveling column (26), as well as a transport device (47) 

extending through the tunnel (45). 
The machine tool of claim 4, characterized in that the 
storage area (46) is joined to the spindle head (31). 
The machine tool of claim 4, characterized in that the 
storage area (46') is joined to the traveling column (26). 
The machine tool of one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the gripper arms (40a, 40b) are 

configured as articulated parallelograms, the parallel 
rods (55a, 56a, 55b, 56b) of which being pivotable in a 

vertical plane on pivot elements (58a, 58b) about first, 
horizontal axes (80a, 81a, 80b, 81b), the pivot elements 

(58a, 58b) being mounted on the spindle head (31) so as 
to pivot about second, vertical axes (59a, 59b). 
The machine tool of claim 7, characterized in that the 
gripper arms (40a, 40b) can pivot about the first and the 

second axes (59a, 59b, 80a, 81a, 80b, 81b) by means of 
a linkage (65), such that the linkage (65): 


a) is configured symmetrically with respect to the 
vertical plane (68);  

 
b) can pivot about an axis (66) lying in the vertical 
plane (68); and 
c) comprises two winglike linkage parts (91a, 91b) that 
on the one hand can pivot about fourth axes (95a, 

95b) that are arranged on either side of the vertical 
plane (68) in a plane running perpendicular thereto, 

and can pivot together about the third axis (66); 
and on the other hand are connected by means of a 

linkage arrangement (85a, 85b, 87a, 87b, 88a, 88b,
