<ABSTRACT>
The outer surface of an article (10) is covered with a 
wrapping film (1), and both ends of the wrapping film (1) are 

lap-welded by heating, so that a body seal section (4) is 
created. An unbonded part (5) is formed on the periphery of 

the edge of an upper overlapping film of the wrapping film (1) 
along the marginal line of the same. This unbonded part 

extends between the marginal line of the upper overlapping film 
and the edge of the body seal section (4). A slit (6) is 

formed in the vicinity of the unbonded part (5) at right angles 
to the marginal line of the upper overlapping film. A weakly 

bonded part (7), where the upper overlapping film and a lower 
overlapping film are weakly bonded to each other, is formed to 

be adjacent to the opposite side of the unbonded part (5) of 
the body seal section (4) relative to the slit (6), and extends 

from that side of the unbonded part (5) to a predetermined 
length along a marginal line (4A) of the upper overlapping 

film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article wrapping in accordance with 
the preamble of claim 1, and more particularly to a wrapped article in 
such a form that a wrapping film is attached in close contact 
with an object to be wrapped; for example, a wrapped article 
which contains one or a number of objects such as a magnetic 
tape cassette housed in a case. Among various types of recent commodities arranged in a 
shop, in the case of relatively small products having a regular 
shape such as a magnetic tape cassette, the product is wrapped 
with a transparent or translucent wrapping film coated with 
cellophane, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, 
polyvinylidenechloride, or the like, in order to protect the 
product from dust or moisture and so maintain a good 
appearance. These magnetic tape cassettes are shipped as a 
wrapped article or displayed in the shop as one of packages to 
be sold en block in which an appropriate number of goods are 
collectively packed. As a matter of course, when an article (a product) 
wrapped in this type of wrapping film is used, it is necessary  
 
to remove this wrapping film. In most cases, as shown in 
Figure 17, a tearing tape 2 is formed inside the wrapping film, 
and a constitution for facilitating the removal of the film 
from an article 10 is generally adopted. In other words, this tearing tape 2 allows a wrapping 
film 1 to be appropriately split and separated by pulling an 
exposed end 2a of the tape 2. Slits 3 are formed along this 
tearing tape in the vicinity of the exposed end 2a, thereby 
facilitating the removal of the tape. By means of such a 
constitution, the wrapping film 1 can be split along the 
tearing tape 2 from the end 2a. As a result of this, the 
wrapping film 1 is split up completely or separated in two. A wrapping method which is generally called shrink-wrap 
is widely used for such a wrapping film. In this shrink-wrap, 
when a wrapping film is attached to an article to be wrapped 
(i.e. a product), the product is enclosed in the wrapping film 
while the film is appropriately stretched or heated to a suitable 
temperature in accordance with the material of the film. 
The wrapping film is tightly attached on to the surface of the 
product because of a contracting action of the film, so that 
the product is enclosed giving it a good appearance. Such 
tight attachment of the film to the product involves a 
laborious removal action to open the film. Conventionally, 
several measures are taken to overcome the drawback in the 
prior art

<CLAIMS>
An article wrapping with an article (10) 
whose outer surface is covered with a wrapping film (1) having a body 

seal section (4) created by making ends of the wrapping film (1) 
overlap with each other and bonding them together, a portion (7,7') 

of the body seal section being weakly bonded, characterised by 

an unbonded portion (5,5') formed along the periphery (4A) of an outer 
overlapping end or layer of the wrapping film in such a way that the 

unbonded portion of the outer overlapping end is not adhered to the inner 
overlapping end or layer of the 

wrapping film; 
a slit (6) formed in the outer overlapping end in a bonded portion 
in the vicinity of the unbonded portion (5,5') at right angles or at an inclined 

angle to the edge (4A) of the outer overlapping end; and 
the weakly bonded portion (7,7') 
extending from the opposite side of the 

unbonded portion relative to the slit to a predetermined length 
along the periphery of the outer overlapping end. 
An article wrapping as defined in Claim 1, wherein two 
opening sections, each including the unbonded portion, the slit (6) 

and the weakly bonded portion, are arranged such that the weakly 
bonded portions are located between the unbonded portions (5,5'). 
An article wrapping as defined in Claims 1 or 2, further 
comprising a notch (8) that is further provided in the inner overlapping layer 

in the vicinity of 
the position where the marginal line (1B) of the inner overlapping end 

and an imaginary continuation from the slit (6) cross each other.  
 
An article wrapping as defined in any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
unbonded portion is provided with a mark (20) to make it distinctive. 
An article wrapping as defined in any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein a 
mark is provided in the unbonded portion or in the vicinity of the 

unbonded portion to indicate an opening direction.
