weight of the composition, of a pigment in about 

40-90 wt.%, based on the weight of the 
composition, of a C

(b) about 0.1 to 5.0 wt.%, based on the weight of 
the composition, of a soap of a tall oil fatty 

acid. 
The printing ink composition has the unique 
capability of being utilized in lithographic printing 

processes utilizing tap water rather than aqueous 
fountain solution in the dampening system of the press.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing ink
composition. More particularly, it relates to a printing
ink composition which has the unique capability of being
utilized in lithographic printing processes wherein the
fountain solution consists of tap water.The printing ink compositions of the present
invention are particularly suited for use in lithography.
Lithography is a printing process that relies on a
chemical distinction between image and non-image areas of
the printing plate rather than any physical relief
differentiation. Such plates are referred to as
planographic since the image and non-image areas are in
the same plane. The plates are constructed so that with
proper treatment the image areas are hydrophobic and
oleophilic and thereby receptive to inks. The non-image
areas are hydrophilic and are water receptive.With the exception of driographic, i.e. waterless,
plates, all types of lithographic plates require a
continuous supply of an aqueous fountain solution to
activate and maintain the distinction between ink-accepting
image areas and ink-repelling non-image areas.As regards lithography, the distinction between
image and non-image areas is sufficient to cause the
following effects:
1) aqueous fountain solution spreads on the non-image
area; 2) aqueous fountain solution in the image area is
unable to form a continuous film, leaving the
image free to accept ink.In the absence of water, the image/non-image
distinction is not, however, sufficient to stop printing
ink, with its lower surface tension, from wetting both
areas. Hence the need for an aqueous fountain solution
in lithography to generate a barrier between the ink and
non-image area.The foregoing explanation of lithography is highly
simplified since it is based on a static situation. In
practice, however, the situation is complicated because
ink and aqueous fountain solution are being continuously
applied from roller systems to the printing plate.The aqueous fountain solution is used to maintain
the non-image areas of a lithographic printing plate non-receptive
to ink. While an offset printing press is
running, aqueous fountain solution is continuously
applied to the printing plate just before the application
of the printing ink, or as a water in ink emulsion. The
aqueous fountain solution has an affinity for the
non-image, hydrophilic areas of the plate and immediately
wets these areas. A complete and uniform film of aqueous
fountain solution prevents the subsequent application of
ink from covering the plate in a non-image area.
