<ABSTRACT>
If motion occurs in an area viewed by a lens (14) of a video camera (12), a video security monitoring system (10) establishes a communication link with a video monitoring facility and begins transmitting compressed video images of the area. The system (10) is fabricated from CMOS integrated circuits, and operates at a reduced clock frequency while motion is not detected. Reducing the clock frequency lowers the required power thus permitting operation of the system (10) on energy supplied by an ISDN basic access communication channel. If motion occurs, a digital video image compression subsystem (16) begins producing low quality compressed video data for transmission to the monitoring facility. If motion occurs in the central region of the area viewed by the lens (14), then the subsystem (16) produces a single high quality compressed video image. Commands transmitted from the monitoring facility to the video security monitoring system (10) may control its entire operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW POWER VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEMTechnical FieldThe present invention relates generally to the technical field of security devices that sense movement, and more parÂ¬ ticularly, to video systems for observing an area to detect motion.Background Art Well known in the art .are video security systems that present an observer located at a video monitoring facility with a succession of images of different areas, each area being viewed by a lens of a different video camera. However, these video systems are completely passive in the sense that detecting an intrusion into the area viewed by the camera's lens remains the responsibility of the observer. That is, the video camera provides the observer with no assistance in detecting an intrusion. Thus, if the observer at the video monitoring facility is distracted or fails to notice the occurrence of an intrusion, no alarm will be raised. It is also possible that the occurrence of an intrusion might be missed because images of other areas are being presented to the observer at the instant the intrusion occurs. Furthermore, because the video signal from each video camera must be trans- mitted to the video monitoring facility by a wide bandwidth, coaxial cable, or by some other type of wide bandwidth, dedicated communication channel such as a microwave link, it is commercially impractical to distribute this type of video security system at sites randomly located within an extended geographic area, such as throughout a large city.In addition to well known, passive security systems of the type described above, active, motion sensing video systems have been developed for military battlefield applications. However, these experimental military systems were physically very large, e.g. were carried on a trailer and towed by a jeep, consumed hundreds of watts of power, and were very expensive.Recently, throughout the world, telephone systems have begun providing digital communication capability in accordance 

with the Integrated Services Digital Network ("ISDN") standard established by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee ("CCITT") . Under this CCITT standard, a basic ISDN access consists of two full-duplex 64 kilobits per second ("kbps") digital data channels, called channel Bl and channel B2, plus another full-duplex 16-kbps digital channel, called a D channel. Under the CCITT standard, using time division multiplexing, all three of these digital data channels may be transmitted over a single pair of twisted wires, or over two pairs
