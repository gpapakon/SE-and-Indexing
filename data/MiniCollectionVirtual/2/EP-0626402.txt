<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of non-crosslinked 
linear monofunctional and telechelic difunctional unsaturated 

polymers wherein the functional groups are reactive terminal groups other 
than vinyl groups. The average functionality number of the 

monofunctional unsaturated polymers is at least 0.7, as determined by 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The average 

functionality number of the telechelic difunctional polymers is at least 1.6-1.7, 
as determined by NMR. Monofunctional olefins and difunctional 

olefins are reacted with cyclic olefins or unsaturated polymers to prepare 
difunctional polymers. The process is substantially free of side reactions 

comprising double bond migration and cyclization. The unsaturated 
functional polymers can be reacted in condensation, addition and 

transesterification reactions to prepare polyesters, graft copolymers, 
polyurethanes, polyureas, polyamides, thermoplastic and thermosetting 

resins, block copolymers, ion exchange resins, adhesives, films, fibers, 
foams and flocculants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to non-crosslinked linear telechelic polymers wherein
the chain terminal groups are functional reactive groups, and to a process for
preparation of these polymers. The functional reactive groups include ester
groups such as acrylate, undecylenate, and methacrylate groups. The process
uses olefin metathesis reactions wherein monofunctional acyclic olefins are
reacted in a first step reaction in the presence of a catalyst comprising a transition
metal compound, an organic tin compound or aluminum halide and an organic
Lewis base to prepare a linear mono- or difunctional olefin which, optionally, in
a second step reaction is reacted with a cyclic olefin or unsaturated polymer in
the presence of the same catalyst to prepare linear telechelic low molecular
weight polymers of high functional purity. Undesired side reactions such as
double bond migration are minimized by the selected catalyst. Monofunctional
linear acyclic olefins of up to 30 carbon atoms or unsaturated linear polymers with
reactive endgroups are used to prepare non-crosslinked difunctional linear acyclic
olefinic polymers with reactive terminal groups. The preparation of difunctional
linear acyclic olefinic polymers with reactive terminal groups from readily available
olefinic monofunctional compounds overcomes limitations of previous processes
which relied upon the preparation of difunctional olefinic compounds by ring-opening
reactions of cyclic olefins with ring-attached reactive groups. The
resulting prior art compounds were typically crosslinked compounds. The linear
telechelic low molecular weight polymers of high functional purity can be
selectively reacted in a third reaction to prepare low and high molecular weight
polymers with terminal ester, alcohol, amide, amine, or urea groups.Accordingly, this invention relates to non-crosslinked telechelic difunctional
polymers and to their preparation by metathesis reactions of two olefins with each
other, or wherein one olefin reactant is a long chain acyclic unsaturated polymer
or cyclic olefin, and the other reactant is an acyclic olefin reactant having at least
one terminal functional group, including an ester group such as an acrylate group
or a methacrylate group or an undecylenate group. Although the preparation of monomeric unsaturated mono- and
difunctional compounds, such as mono- and dicarboxylic acid esters by an
addition reaction of an olefin with a mono- or dicarboxylic acid ester is well
known, as is taught in U. S. Patent 3,783,136, the preparation of
