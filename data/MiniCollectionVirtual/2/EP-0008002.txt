<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to electronic circuit package 
and method of testing such package, and deals with the 

testing of a network of electrical interconnections between 
chips (20) mounted on an insulating substrate (10) of a 

circuit module and between the chips and the input and 
output pins of the module. Each of the mounted chips (20) 

contains masking circuits which can be activated to prevent 
signals from the outputs of logic circuits on the chip from 

being transmitted off the chip and into the interconnection 
network (11). Also each of the chips (20) contains emitter 

follower circuits (40) that logically connect all the chip in­
put terminals to a common output terminal (23) of the 

chip. In testing, the mask circuits are activated. Then poten­
tial levels are selectively applied to a plurality of test points 

in the interconnection network and differences in potential 
level between these test points and/or between the points 

and one or more of the common terminals are determined.
