<ABSTRACT>
In a rotary atomizer a disc- or wheel-shaped atomizing device (6) is secured to one end of a shaft (7) which is connected with the rotor (8) of a high frequency asynchronous electric motor (2). The motor (2) is operated at a rotational speed substantially higher than the first critical speed of the shaft (7) and atomizing device (6). The shaft (7) and the rotor (8) of the high frequency motor are designed as one integral unit radially supported only by bearings (9, 10) at either end of a part (7a) of the shaft (7) surrounded by the rotor (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rotary atomizer of the 
kind in which a disk- or wheel-shaped atomizing device 
is secured to one end of a shaft which is connected with 
the rotor of a high frequency asynchronous electric 
motor, the operating speed of which is controlled by a 
frequency converter to impart to the shaft a rotational 
speed substantially higher than the first critical speed 
of the shaft and atomizing device. In general, rotary atomizers in which the atomizing 
disc or wheel is directly driven by a high speed 
electric motor such as known, e.g. from Keith Masters: 
"Spray Drying Handbook", 5th Edition, New York 1991, 
page 218, offer the advantage that a gear transmission 
between the drive motor and the atomizer is not 
required. In some prior art atomizers of this kind a 
comparatively short rigid shaft carrying the atomizing 
device at its lower end has been coupled with the rotor 
of the high frequency motor. With such a design, the necessity to operate the 
atomizer within a speed range safely below the first 
critical speed of the shaft and the atomizer wheel sets 
limits to the diameter range of atomizer wheels, for 
which a direct high frequency motor drive can be 
successfully used when the circumferential velocity 
required for atomization is to be achieved. From US-A-4,713,146 it is known to operate 
rotary atomizers at rotational speeds higher than the 
first critical speed of the rotating parts by a rather 
complicated shaft design involving incorporation of 
spring means between inner and outer shaft members to 
permit flexible pivotal motions of the shaft during 
start and stop of the atomizer. On this background, it is the object of the  
 
invention to provide a rotary atomizer of the kind 
described which to a much lesser extent suffers from the 
described limitations and may thus be successfully used 
for a far wider range of rotary atomizers down to 
small-scale atomizers with a power consumption of 1 kW 
and with a smaller wheel diameter down to, e.g. 90mms 
or less and which provides flexibility of the shaft with 
a simple design of the rotary system. According to the invention this object is achieved 
by a design characterized in that the shaft and the 
rotor are designed as one integral unit with the rotor 
surrounding a part of the shaft remote from said one 
end, said shaft and rotor unit being radially supported 
only by radial bearings at either end of said part of 
the shaft. By operating the atomizer at supercritical 
rotational speed the atomizing device will be
