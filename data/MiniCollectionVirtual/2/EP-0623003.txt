<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a system and a method for closing septal defects and the like. The system includes a closure device (10) having a pair of occluding disks (20, 30) each disk being formed of a membrane (22, 32) and an elastically deformable frame (24, 34) carried about the periphery of the membrane (22, 32). The frame (24, 34) which may be formed of a superelastic material, is capable of being collapsed for passage through a catheter and elastically returning to a predetermined shape for tautly holding the membrane. A central portion of the membrane (22, 32), of each disk (20, 30) is attached to a central portion of the other membrane to define a conjoint disk (40). The method of the invention involves collapsing the frames (24, 34) of the disks (20, 30) inserting the closure device (10) into a catheter, and positioning the distal end of the catheter adjacent a septal defect. The first disk (70) is then urged out of the distal end of the catheter to permit its frame (24) to elastically return to a predetermined shape, pulling the membrane (22) taut on one side of the defect. The second disk (30) is then similarly deployed on another side of the defect, automatically positioning the conjoint disk (40) within the defect to occlude it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to device for occluding septal
defects or shunts in the heart or the vascular system. In particular, the present invention
provides a device for closing such defects which may be delivered through a catheter.A septum is generally defined as a thin wall of muscle or other tissue which
divides two or more chambers or other areas within the body. The term "septal defect"
generally refers to a perforation or other hole which passes through a septum. Ventricular
septal defects, atrial septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus are the three most common
congenital cardiac malformations. Of these three malformations, atrial septal defects are
the easiest to approach through a transcatheter approach and the defects themselves are
located away from the atrioventricular valve apparatus. These defects have been
surgically corrected for decades.Initially, atrial septal defects were corrected by open heart surgery. In such an
operation, the surgeon would have to open the chest of a patient and bypass the heart
temporarily, e.g., by means of a mechanical heart or a "heart-lung machine." The
surgeon would then physically cut into the heart and suture small defects closed. In the
case of larger defects, a patch of a biologically compatible material would be sewn onto
the septum to cover the defect. An atrial septal defect makes the heart muscles work
considerably harder because of shunting of blood through the defect and, if left untreated,
leads to high pulmonary arterial pressures, and this additional strain placed on the heart
muscles can cause fatal heart failure.In order to avoid the morbidity and mortality associated with open heart surgery,
a variety of transcatheter closure techniques have been attempted. In such techniques, an 
occluding device is delivered through a catheter. Once the closure device is positioned
adjacent the defect, it must be attached to the rest of the septum in a manner which
permits it to effectively block the passage of blood through the defect.The first such closure device was proposed by King and Mills nearly 20 years ago
and is described in U.S. patent 3,874,388 (1975), the teachings of which are incorporated
herein by reference. The King closure device comprises a pair of complex mechanical
umbrellas, with each umbrella having a plurality of arms extending radially from a central
hub. The hubs of the two umbrellas are mechanically connected to one another and each
umbrella includes a fabric covering over the arms, much like a common umbrella.
