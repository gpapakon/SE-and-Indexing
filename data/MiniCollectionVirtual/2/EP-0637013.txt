<ABSTRACT>
A valid data packet is transmitted and received in async. transfer mode (ATM). The incoming speech signal (X(n)) is analysed to calculate filter coeffts. (e(i),a(i)) for a digital input filter (PF) and for a digital output filter (SF). A difference signal (d(n)) is derived from the incoming speech signal (X(n)) from the input filter (PF) and supplied to the output filter (SF) as a stimulation signal (e(n)). The transfer functions of the input filter (PF) and output filter (SF) are the inverse of each other so that the speech signal (Y(n)) from the output filter (SF) is formed from the calculated filter coeffts. (e(i),a(i)). After the initial analysis of the incoming speech signal (X(n)), the stimulation signal (e(n)) is analysed to derive a period (M) of the speech signal frequency. The filter coeffts. (a(i)) are maintained by base frequency sync. repetition of the stimulation signal and a substitute signal (e(n-m)) is formed when the last data packet is received. If a data packet is lost, the substitute signal (e(n-m)) is fed to the output filter as an output signal (e(n)) and a substitute speech signal (Y*(n)) is formed and delivered.
