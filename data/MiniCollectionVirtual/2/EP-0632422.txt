<ABSTRACT>
A label 1, having a base section 2a of a base film 2, which base section is coated at least partially with adhesive on the underside, and having at least one hanging tab 3 which is integral with the base section 2a and is formed by a punch-out 4 from the remaining section 2b of the base film 2, said punch-out having the shape of a closed curve. The top side of the base film 2 is provided at least partially with an adhesive, and the hanging tab 3 which can be folded onto the base section 2a of the base film 2 is attached there by means of the adhesive.

A label having a bottom portion (2a) of a base film (2), which bottom portion 
(2a) is coated on the underside at least partially with adhesive, and having at least one 

suspension strap (3), which is formed by a punch out (4) of the residual portion 
(2b) of the base film (2), which punch out (4) has the shape of a closed curve, 

characterized in that the top side of the base film (2) is provided, at least in places, 
with a bonding agent and the suspension strap (3), which can be folded over onto the 

bottom portion (2a) of the base film (2), is fastened there by means of the bonding 
agent. 
The label as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the bonding agent is a 
heat-seal wax. 
The label as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the bonding agent is a 
special cold glue. 
The label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the angle (Î±) 
which is formed by the inner margin of the suspension strap (3) and the margin of the 

bottom portion (2a) of the base film (2) is substantially less than a right angle. 
The label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the bottom 
portion (2a) of the base film (2), at junction points (11, 12) with the suspension 

strap (3), exhibits punch-ins (13, 14, 15, 16) running approximately in the 
direction of an imaginary extension line of the margins of the suspension strap (3). 
The label as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the punch-ins (13, 14, 
15, 16) exhibit, at their end facing away from the suspension strap (3), a respective 

curvature (17, 18, 19, 20). 
The label as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the region limited by 
the punch-ins (13, 14) and that region of the bottom portion (2a) of the base film 

(2) limited by the punch-ins (15, 16) are respectively coated on their underside 
with adhesive.  

 
The label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the adhesive 
with which the underside of the bottom portion (2a) of the base film (2) is at least 

partially coated is a self-adhesive coating. 
The label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the base film 
(2) is transparent and exhibits on its underside an imprint (6). 
A process for the manufacture of labels (1) which are punched out of a base 
film material length (2) and have, respectively, at least one suspension strap (3) 

formed in one piece with a bottom portion (2a) of the base film material length (2), 
which suspension strap (3) is produced by the residual portion (2b) of the base film 

material length (2) being provided with punches (4, 5) in the region of the 
suspension strap, (3) the punches (4) respectively having the shape of a closed 

curve, characterized in that 

a) the base film material length (2), prior to being applied to a carrier film (8), is 
provided with the punches (4, 5) in the region of the suspension strap (3), so that at 

least the punches (4, 5) in the region of the suspension strap (3) are designed as 
through-punches, 
b) the base film material length (2), which exhibits on its top side, at least in places, 
a bonding agent, is folded in the longitudinal direction in such a way that the suspension 

straps (3) are forced against the bottom portion (2a) of the base film material length 
(2) and stick there as a result of the bonding agent, and 
c) the underside of the bottom portion (2a) of the base film material length (2) is 
coated with adhesive. 
The process as claimed in claim 10, characterized in that the base film 
material length (2) is printed on its underside prior to the coating of the adhesive.
