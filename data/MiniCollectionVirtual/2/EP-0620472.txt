<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid 
crystal panel for displaying an image. An active matrix type driving method using 
TFTs (Thin Film Transistors) as switching elements is 
often adopted for a display device so as to display 
high quality images. The reason is that, the active 
matrix method makes it possible to achieve a high 
contrast ratio irrespective of the number of scanning 
electrodes, and to obtain clear images even when displaying 
a large-capacity image with a high resolution, 
as compared with a simple matrix driving method, which 
does not use switching elements. In such an active matrix type liquid crystal 
display device, an NW (Normally White) mode, incorporating 
a TN (Twisted Nematic) configuration, is often 
used. The TN configuration is characterized by the 90° 
twisted orientation of the nematic liquid crystal 
molecules. In the NW mode, the two polarizing plates 
are attached to the liquid crystal panel in such a 
manner that the respective polarizing axes thereof are 
perpendicular to each other, and the polarizing axis of 
one of the polarizing plates is parallel or perpendicular 
to the longer axis of each liquid crystal molecule 
in contact with one of the substrates. According to 
the NW mode using the TN configuration, the display 
device is in a white state when no voltage or a low 
voltage below a threshold voltage value is applied to  
 
the interspace between the substrates; the display 
device is in a black state when a voltage higher than 
the above-mentioned low voltage is applied. When a voltage is applied to the liquid 
crystal panel, the liquid crystal molecules align along 
the direction of the applied electric field while 
unwinding their twisted structure. As with the change 
in the molecule orientation, the polarization characteristics 
of light transmitted through the liquid 
crystal panel are changed, whereby the light transmittance 
is modified. These polarization characteristics 
are varied by the birefringence of the liquid crystal. 
Generally, the shape of a liquid crystal molecule used 
in the TN configuration is compared to a stick. Each 
liquid crystal molecule is considered to be a birefringent 
medium having an optical axis along the direction 
of the longer axis of such a stick-like configuration. 
As is shown in Figure 12A, a vector 22 representing a 
refractive index of a liquid crystal molecule 4 taken 
in the direction of the longer axis thereof is greater 
than a vector 23 representing a refractive index of the 
liquid crystal molecule 4
