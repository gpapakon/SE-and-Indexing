<ABSTRACT>
A method for depositing a thin film of a material on an oxide thin 
film having a perovskite type crystal structure formed on a substrate 

comprising steps of depositing a seed layer of a single crystal of the 
material having an extremely thin thickness at a relatively high substrate 

temperature on the oxide thin film having a perovskite type crystal 
structure and depositing a thin film of the material on the seed layer at a 

lower substrate temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for depositing another 
thin film on an oxide thin film having a perovskite crystal structure, more 
specifically to a method for depositing another thin film on an oxide thin 
film having a perovskite crystal structure formed on a substrate with little 
mutual diffusion at an interface between the thin films. Oxide superconductors which have been recently advanced in study 
have higher critical temperatures than those of metal superconductors, so 
that they are more practical. For example, Y-Ba-Cu-O type oxide 
superconductor has a critical temperature higher than 80 K and it is 
announced that Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O type oxide superconductor and 
Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O type oxide superconductor have critical temperatures 
higher than 100 K. These oxide superconductors have perovskite type 
crystal structures. In order to apply the oxide superconductors to superconducting 
devices, it is necessary to form oxide superconductor thin films. The 
superconductor thin films are usually deposited on single crystal  
 
substrates, for example a MgO substrate, a SrTiO3 substrate, a YSZ 
(yttrium stabilized zirconia) substrate, or etc., by various sputterings, an 
MBE (molecular beam epitaxy), a reactive co-evaporation, a CVD 
(chemical vapor deposition). The superconductor thin films grow 
epitaxially on these substrate. It is also necessary to stack other thin films on the oxide 
superconductor thin films for manufacturing superconducting devices. 
For example, a tunnel type Josephson junction comprises a stacked 
structure of a first superconducting layer, an thin insulator layer and a 
second superconducting layer stacked in the named order. Therefore, if 
an oxide superconductor is applied to the tunnel type Josephson junction 
device, a first oxide superconductor thin film, an insulator thin film and a 
second oxide superconductor thin film should be stacked in the named 
order. A superconducting field effect device, one of three-terminal 
superconducting devices has a superconducting channel and a gate 
electrode formed on the superconducting channel through a gate 
insulating layer. If a superconducting field effect device is manufactured 
by using an oxide superconductor, it is necessary to stack an oxide 
superconductor thin film, an insulator thin film and a conductor film. In addition, in order to fabricate a superconducting multi-layer 
wiring structure by using an oxide superconductor, oxide superconducting 
thin films and insulator thin films should be alternately stacked.
