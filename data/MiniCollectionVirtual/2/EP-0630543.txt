<ABSTRACT>
A circuitry is disclosed for superimposing small, low energy (2) and large substantially higher energy (3) signals, in particular for transmitting speech signals with a remote supply direct signal for a receiving circuitry or with a high energy alternating signal, for example a call alternating voltage for signalling. In this circuitry is provided an operation amplifier (1). One pole of the source that supplies the small signal is connected to one input of said operation amplifier whose operational voltage inputs are connected to a voltage supply source. In order to allow low energy, weak signal, such as speech signals, and high energy signals and direct voltages to be transmitted by such circuitry over a subscriber line by means of simple components, the second pole of the small signal source (2) is linked to the second input of the operation amplifier (1) and one pole of a higher energy signal supply source (3) is linked to one pole of the voltage supply source (V).

Circuit arrangement for the transmission of small 
low-power signals and large, essentially higher-power 

signals, in particular for the transmission of voice 
signals, with a DC signal for the remote power feeding of 

a receiver circuit or with a high-power AC signal, for 
example an AC ringing voltage for signalling, in the case 

of which there is provided an operational amplifier (1) 
which has a predetermined gain, to one input of which 

there is connected one pole of a source (2) supplying the 
low-power signal and the operating voltage inputs of 

which are connected to a supply voltage source (V), 
characterized in that the second pole of the source (2) 

supplying the low-power signals is connected to the 
second input of the operational amplifier (1), one pole 

of a source (3) supplying higher-power signals is connected 
to a pole of the supply voltage source (V), and 

the second pole of the source (3) supplying higher-power 
signals is connected to the reference potential, the 

decrease in the output voltage (Va) taking place with 
respect to this reference potential and the supply 

voltage source (V) being independent of this reference 
potential. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that one pole of the source (3) supplying 

higher-power signals is connected to an input of the 
operational amplifier (1), to which one pole of the 

supply voltage source (V1, V2) is also connected. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that one pole of the source (3) supplying  

 
higher-power signals is connected to an operating voltage 

input of the operational amplifier (1). 
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the source (3) supplying 

higher-power signals is formed by a clocked voltage 
transformer (8), at the control input of which a control 

signal is present.
