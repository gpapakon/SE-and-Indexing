<ABSTRACT>
Novel spot joint for joining metal sheets by cold flow of the type in which two stampings (cup-shaped features) are made simultaneously in at least two superposed metal sheets (23 and 24) using a punch and a die so as to form, in each of the metal sheets, a cavity (26, 27) on one face and a projection (33, 34) on the other face, the projection (33) of the first metal sheet (23) being inserted into the cavity (27) of the second metal sheet (24), the said cavity (27) of the said second metal sheet (27) having, near its bottom (30), a widened part (31), while the projection (33) of the first metal sheet (26) includes a flared part (32) housed in the said widened part (31), characterised in that the cavity (26) of the first metal sheet (23) has a series of ribs (thickened parts) (35) extending substantially parallel from the bottom of the said cavity to the free edge of the latter.

Assembly point for sheets by cold flow of the
type in which there is formed, simultaneously in at least

two superimposed sheets (23 and 24), by means of punch and
die, two pressings in such a way as to form, in each of the

sheets, a cavity (26, 27) starting from one face and a
protrusion (33, 34) on the other face, the protrusion (33)

of the first sheet (23) being inserted in the cavity (27)
of the second sheet (24), the said cavity (27) of the said

second sheet (24) exhibiting, in the vicinity of its bottom
(30) a widening (31), whilst the protrusion (33) of the

first sheet (23) comprises a splaying (32) lodged in the
said widening (31), characterised in that the cavity (26)

of the first sheet (23) exhibits a series of substantially
parallel beads (35) from the bottom of the said cavity to

the free edge of the latter.
Assembly point, according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the beads (35) are four in number and

are regularly spaced.
Tools for producing the assembly point, according
to Claim 1 and of the type comprising a punch (8) with a

blank clamp (5), a die (10) comprising an anvil (14)
against which are elastically applied shells (11) which can

move over a guidance surface (12) and which are limited in
their displacement by a stop (16), characterised in that

the punch (8) comprises grooves (9) extending parallel with
the longitudinal axis of the said punch (8) and emerging at

its free end.
Tools, according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the punch (8) has a truncated cone shape.
Tools, according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the punch (8) is terminated by a cylindrical section

(8a) connected to the small base of a cone section (8b). 
Tools, according to Claim 3,characterised in that
the grooves (9) have regular angular spacing.
Tools, according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the free ends of the shells (11) are rounded.
Tools, according to Claim 7, characterised in
that the free ends of the shells (11) are rounded in a such

way that the free edge of the said shells (11) located at
the end of the latter, cooperating with the anvil (14), are

at a distance from the guidance surface which is greater
than the distance separating the free edges of the shells

(11) adjacent to the external side walls of the latter.
