<ABSTRACT>
A winding accumulator system for controlling the 
transfer of filamentary material between a source and a 

winding receptacle comprises serially interconnected 
accumulator units (18,22,30) each storing an additional 

amount of material stored by the preceding unit, material 
may be moved between adjacent units by means including a 

capstan motor (20,28). A programmed controller controls the 
motors between adjacent units in order to maintain proper 

line tensions as filamentary material is moved from one unit 
to another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to method and apparatus for 
accumulator systems for maintaining proper line tension during the 
winding of filamentary material such as wire or cable from a primary 
source of filamentary material such as the apparatus for making the 
filamentary material or a secondary source such as a spool of 
filamentary material, and more particularly to such apparatus and 
method using a plurality of serially connected active accumulator 
elements which are interdependently controlled from a programmed 
controller. FR-A-1 052 863 discloses a winding accumulator system according 
to the preamble of claim 1. U.S. Patent No. 3,282,488 issued to Bauer et al. November 
1, 1966, discloses a web conveying apparatus using an overrunning 
clutch assembly geared to a dancer roll to power the vertical 
descent of the dancer roll and limit its descent speed in a system 
employing a plurality of rotary transport rolls engageable with a 
web to be transported. U.S. Patent No. 3,540,641 issued to Besnyo November 17, 
1970, relates to a web accumulator for maintaining a substantially 
uniform web tension in which a pair of opposed arms are mounted for 
swinging movement at opposite ends of a frame. A plurality of 
rollers are located at spaced intervals along the arms and the web 
is conducted alternately over a roller at the outer end of one arm 
and a roller at the inner end of the other arm and progressively 
back and forth over the rollers of both arms and then off the frame  
 
at the opposite end. The arms swing in coordinated relation to 
provide wide variation of spacing and the arms are powered to swing 
when the tension in the web changes. U.S. Patent No. 3,692,251 issued to Melead September 19, 
1972, discloses a tensioning apparatus used with winding and 
unwinding apparatus for thread-like filamentary material in which a 
roller is mounted for rotation in members disposed at the ends of 
the roller and supported by pivot arms, thereby enabling horizontal 
movement of the roller. The moving filamentary material engages the 
roller to apply a horizontal force opposite to a pre-determined 
desired horizontal force. Changes in the tension of the filamentary 
material cause horizontal motion of the roller and that motion 
adjusts tensions by changing the speed of the filamentary material. U.S. Patent No. 3,871,205 issued to Fenton March 18, 1975, 
relates to apparatus for the length stabilization of armored well 
logging cable wherein the cable is passed from a payoff reel over 
hold-back

<CLAIMS>
A winding accumulator system for controlling the 
storage of filamentary material between a source of such 

material and a winding receptacle, comprising: 

a plurality of serially interconnected accumulator 
units (18,22,30) each including means for storing 

filamentary material, 
each of the accumulator units including a stationary block 

(14,24,32) and a movable block (16,26,34), whereby movement 
of said movable block away from and toward said stationary 

block respectively increases or decreases the amount of 
filamentary material stored in the respective accumulator 

unit; 
means for varying the movement of said filamentary 
material between adjacent accumulator units and including a 

capstan motor (20,28) between each successive accumulator 
unit; and 
means for controlling said means for varying to 
limit the change in tension of said filamentary material 

with changes in the acceleration or deceleration of said 
filamentary material caused by a change in the input or 

output of filamentary material to or from the accumulator 
system, and further including means (80,82,84) for 

determining the direction of movement of each said movable 
block from the relative speed of movement of filamentary 

material into and out of the respective accumulator unit, 
characterized in that the first accumulator unit 

receives filamentary material from said source and stores 
a given amount of filamentary material and each succeeding 

accumulator unit stores an integral additional amount of 
filamentary material stored by a preceding accumulator unit, said winding accumulator system further comprising 

means (80,82,84) for sensing the amount of filamentary 
material stored in each of said accumulator units, means 

(92,94,96) for indicating a desired reference amount of  
 

filamentary material to be stored in each of said 
accumulator units; means (86,88,90) for comparing the 

stored and reference amount of filamentary material in each 
accumulator unit to generate respective capstan motor 

control signals and further including means (98,100,102) for 
combining the respective capstan motor control signals from 

two adjacent accumulator units to control the capstan motor 
immediately upstream of said two adjacent accumulator units. 
The winding accumulator system as set forth in 
claim 1, further comprising buffer/dancer means for 

receiving the filamentary material output from the last of 
the accumulator units to enable adjustment of the 

accumulator system to changes in the input of filamentary 
material in the winding receptacle. 
The winding accumulator system as set forth in 
claim 2, wherein said means for controlling further includes 

respective means (80,81,82) for determining the position of 
the movable block in each of the accumulator units, 

respective summing and compensation circuits (86,88,90) 
responsive to the respective position determining means for 

generating respective compensated error signals, and 
respective reference clamping circuits (98,100,102) for 

adjusting the output of a respective summing and 
compensation circuit in accordance with the position of the 

movable block of an adjacent upstream accumulator unit.
