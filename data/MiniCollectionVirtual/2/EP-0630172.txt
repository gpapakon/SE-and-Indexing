<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing weldless resonating monolithic 
cavity comprising the steps of: arranging a die which can 

be disassembled into sectors and having the form of the 
internal cavity of the resonator; spinning a foil by 

using said die so as to provide a monolithic weldless 
body of metal sheet which coats exactly and completely 

the die; and disassembling and removing the sectors of 
the die through one opening of the resonator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing 
radiofrequency resonating cavities of the weldless type. 
This invention also relates to the monolithic 
accelerating cavity obtained from such method. At the present state of art, the accelerating cavities 
both of bulk niobium and niobium-sputtered OFHC copper 
are commonly fabricated by lathe spinning or deep drawing 
the half cells of the resonator which are then electron 
beam welded from the interior. Because of the size of the 
electron beam deflection magnet the welding from the 
interior is a severe limitation to this technique applied 
to high frequency resonating cavities besides further 
drawbacks such as the residual radiofrequency power loss 
in the superconducting layer due to any welding defect. The new generation of superconducting accelerators need 
high quality particle beams to be collided to one another 
at energy levels which cannot be reached without the aid 
of superconducting cavities. Development of high gradient 
accelerating fields near the thoretical limit is needed 
in resonating accelerating structures operating between 
1,5 and 3 GHz. 
The development of an optimized inner resonator surface 
is necessary for providing high accelerating fields; 
large investments in several industries and laboratories 
are employed at present in that development.  
 The object of the invention is to provide a method of 
producing resonating cavities with one or more weldless 
cells in a technically and economically convenient 
manner. 
The object according to the invention is achieved by 
extending the half cell spinning method to the whole 
cavity onto a suitable die which can be disassembled 
under control as disclosed in the characterizing part of 
claim 1. This invention will now be described with reference to 
the accompanying drawings showing by way of an 
illustrative, non-limitative example a preferred 
embodiment of the invention. 
In the drawings: 
Fig. 1 shows schematically a multi-cell cavity of the 
prior art. Fig. 2A shows a single cell cavity resonating at the 
frequency of 1,5 GHz. Fig. 2B shows the dimension of the interior of the cavity 
of Fig. 2A. Fig. 3 shows the die for carrying out the method. Fig. 4 shows the die of Fig. 3 disassembled in three 
parts. Figs. 5A and 5B show the detail of the two end cylinders  
 
of Fig. 4. Fig. 6 shows the central shell of the die divided into 
sectors or slices. Figs. 7A and 7B show a vertical section of the ring and

A method of producing a weldless radiofrequency 
resonating cavity, characterized by the steps of: 

arranging a die which can be disassembled in component parts and having the 
form of the internal cavity of the resonator; blocking 

said die between two cylinders having the form of the 
cut-off tubes; spinning a foil by using the die together 

with the cylinders until a monolithic body covering the 
whole assembly is provided; and disengaging the die by 

disassembling the component parts. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that in the 
spinning step a foil material formed of one piece of bulk 

niobium is used. 
The method of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the foil of niobium has a thickness of about 0,1 mm (100 

microns) and is coated with about 1 mm thick copper or 
silver layer by electrodeposition. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the foil 
material is OFHC copper on which a niobium coating is 

sputtered. 
The method of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
said foil material of copper or niobium is used in the 

form of a disc which is clamped between the lower surface 
of the die and the mandrel of the drawing lathe and then 

is spun in the form of a frustum of cone, the smallest 
section corresponding to that of the end cylinders of the  

 
die. 
The method of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
said frustum of cone has an angle compatible with the 

dimension of the cavity to be produced, and the lathe 
spinning of the central part, i.e. the die shell, is 

carried out in two steps with an intermediate fast 
annealing. 
The method of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
said step of fast annealing is carried out at a 

temperature lower than 600Â°C when the lathe spinning is 
operating on the equatorial area of said shell having the 

largest diameter, and when a half cell with relative 
cut-off tube has been already made. 
The method of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
die shell is made of synthetic 

material such as nylon, PVC or organic fiber or resin, 
while the two cylinders for the 

cut-off tubes are made of steel.

coupling surfaces cooperating with a pin carried by one 
cylinder and introduced into a seat of the other 

cylinder.

the die shell is divided into sectors or slices defined 

by meridian planes symmetric to an axial plane and 
provided with bevellings at the inner corners.
