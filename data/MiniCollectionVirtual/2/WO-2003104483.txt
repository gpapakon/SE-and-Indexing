<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to methods and compositions for the determination of deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) activity. The methods and compositions of the invention are amenable to high throughput screening assays for the identification of inhibitors and enhancers of DXPS activity. Such compounds have use in the modulation of plant and microbial growth. The compositions of the invention are DXPS fragments and chimeric polypeptides that have increased solubility as compared to the wild type DXPS polypeptide. These DXPS fragments and chimeric polypeptides, or variants thereof, can be recombinantly expressed and purified in quantities suitable for high throughput screening assays. The assays of the invention are based on the detection of substrates of DXPS that remain after a DXPS reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF MODULATORS OF DEOXYXYLULOSE 5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASEACTIVITYFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to assays for measuring deoxyxylulose 5- phosphate synthase (DXPS) activity- The assays can be used to identify compounds, that inhibit or enhance DXPS activity. Such compounds have use in modulating plant and microbial growth and development.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONDeoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosρhate (DXP) is a common precursor of thiamin (vitamin Bl), pyridoxyl (vitamin B6) and isoprenoids. Isoprenoids encompass a large family of biomolecules, including vitamins A, D, E and K, cholesterol, plant pigments such as carotenoids and the phytol chain of chlorophyll, natural rubber,-ft many essential oils, plant hormones (gibererellins, abscisic acid), insect juvenile hormone, dolichols, quinone electron carriers in mitochondria and chloroplasts, such as ubiquinone and plastoquinone, structural components of membranes (phytosterols) and Ras protein. In higher plants and bacteria, the first step in the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate, the common precursor of all isoprenoids, by the mevalonate- independent pathway is the Formation of DXP from the precursors pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosρhate (Figure 1). The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme- l - 

deoxyxylulose 5-ρhosρhate synthase (DXPS) (Lange et al. (1998) ProcN tlAcad Sci 95:2100-2104; Lois et. al. (199S) Proc N tl Acad Sci 95:2105-2110; Sprenger et al. (1997) Proc Nad Acad Sci 94:12857-12862)-The DXPS genes or cDNAs from E. coli (GenBaπk AF03544O), Hemophilus tnfluenzae (Swiss-Prot F54205), Rhodobacter capsulatus (Swiss-Prat P26242), Synechocystus sp. PCC6803 (GenBank D90903), Bacillus subtilis (Swiss-Prot P54523), Helicobacter pylori (GenBank AE000552), Mycoplasma tuberculosis (GehBarik Z96072), Glycine max (GenBank AW27S762), Lycopersicon escul ntum (GenBank AF143812), Catharanthus roseus (GenBank AJ011840), Mentha x peperita (GenBank AF019383) and Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank AF010383 and 5281015) have been cloned. Also, ESTs encoding fragments of DXPS have been identified in Oryza sativa, Ricinus co munis, and Pinus taeda. However, no homologues of the DXPS genes have been identified in -----i als.Disruption of the DXPS gene in Arabidopsis results in an albino phenotype due to a lack of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. These results indicate that DXPS is essential for chloroplast function (Lange et al.) and that inhibitors of DXPS activity may have use as herbicides. Accordingly,
