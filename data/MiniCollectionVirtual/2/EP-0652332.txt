<ABSTRACT>
In order to facilitate the mounting and, if appropriate, demounting of insulating panels (1) made of thermally insulating and, if appropriate, sound-insulating materials, with a tapering end (11) and with another end (10) which opens outwards, in particular along oblique surfaces (6), the last-mentioned end is provided inside with a cutout (2) which merges into at least one locking lug (8). The tapering end (11) exhibits a locking part (4), of which the greatest width is greater than the width of a narrow point in the region of the transition to the relevant oblique surface (5) and is greater than the width of the narrow point in the region of the locking lug (8).

Thermally insulating panel (1) exclusively made of fibrous insulating material or
cork, possibly with acoustic insulation,
characterized by

a tapering end (11) and another end (10) opening to the outside for joining adjacent
insulating panels by insertion, wherein said outwardly opening end (10) includes an

inner recess (2) which changes over to at least one locking lug (8) for forming a
neck (8a) in the zone of transition to an inclined surface (6), and wherein said tapering

end (11) comprises a blocking portion (4) having a widest width (D) exceeding
the width (C) of a neck (7a) in the zone of transition to an inclined surface (5)

and exceeding the width (B) of said neck (8a) in the zone of said locking lug (8).
Thermally insulating panel according to Claim 1,
characterized in

that the edge (2a) of said recess (2) is located on a circle having a diameter (A)
corresponding at least to the widest width (D) of said blocking portion (4).
Thermally insulating panel according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in

that the edge (9a) of said blocking portion (4) is located on a circle having a diameter
corresponding to the widest width (D)) of said blocking portion (4). 
Thermally insulating panel according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in

that the respective edge (2a, 9) of said recess (2) or said blocking portion (4) passes
ov
er into an adjacent inclined surface (5, 6), at the respective neck (7a, 8a), and that
said locking lug (8) is located at the respective point of transition.
Thermally insulating panel according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in

that the width (C) of said neck (7a) of said blocking portion (4) comes within a
range between 50% and 95% of the widest width (D) of this portion.
Thermally insulating panel according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in

that the width (B) of said neck (8a) at said locking lug (8) comes within a range
between 85% and 98% of the widest width (D) of said blocking portion (4).
Thermally insulating panel according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in

that the widest width (D) of said blocking portion (4) comes within a range from
30% to 80% of the thickness (F) of the insulating panel (1).
Thermally insulating panel according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in

that said blocking portion (4) and said recess (2) extend each over the total width
(E) of the insulating panel 81). 
Thermally insulating panel according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in

that the ends (10, 11) comprise one respective inclined surface (5, 6) only on one
side.
Thermally insulating panel according to Claim 9,
characterized in

that said blocking portion (4) comprises an edge (9) projecting beyond said locking
lug (8) only on the side facing the respective inclined surface (5).
