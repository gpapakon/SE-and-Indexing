Distribution device for an air-conditioning equipment of an automotive vehicle,
comprising a casing (3) having an airinlet (4) and several outlets (5, 6, 7) which may be

connected to louvres for the defrosting and defogging of window panes of the vehicle,
for the heating of the passenger compartment of the vehicle and for the aeration of the

latter, respectively, and a means (8) for the selective closing of the outlets (5, 6, 7)
accommodated in the casing (3) for controlling the air flow for the outlets,

characterized in that the outlets (5, 6, 7) of the casing (3) are located in a same plane.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the aforesaid closing means
comprises a rotary slide valve (8) consisting of two flaps (9, 10) with two concentric

cylindrical caps (13, 17), respectively, having different lengths of arcs of a circle and
mounted through the medium of radial flanges (11, 12 ;15, 16), the one (13) made fast

to for unitary rotation with a controlled drive shaft mounted onto the casing (3) and the
other one (17) rotatable about this shaft so as to permit the simultaneous rotary drive

of both cylindrical caps (13, 17) in extension of each other from one initial position for
opening one (5) of the outlets of the casing (3) and for closing the other outlets (6, 7)

to a second position for the closing of the previously closed outlet (5) and for the
opening of one (6) of the other outlets (6, 7) and the rotary drive at a third position of

the cylindrical cap of greater dimension (13) above the other cylindrical cap (7)
blocked in the second position of closing of the above mentioned outlet (5) so as to

close the aforesaid one (6) of the outlets and to open the other remaining outlet (7).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that both cylindrical caps (13, 17) are
held in extension of each other by a spring (21) mounted onto the drive shaft and

having one of its ends fastened to one (15) of the flanges of the cylindrical cap (17) and
its other end fastened to the adjacent flange (12) of the other cylindrical cap (13) and in

that the cylindrical cap of greater dimension (13) is displaced over the other cap (17) 
against the return force of the spring (21) holding both caps in extension of one

another.
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that one (15) of the flanges of the
cylindrical cap with the smaller dimension (17) carries a pin (18) extending through

both of a curvilinear slot (19) of the adjacent flange (12) of the other cylindrical cap
(13) and of a like curvilinear slot (20) formed in an end wall (3b) of the casing (3) and

extending in the initial position of both caps the other curvilinear slot (19) while being
both of them concentric with the drive shaft, the pin (18) being substantially in

abutment in both superposed bottoms, respectively, of both slots in extension of each
other (19, 20) of the flanges (12, 15) of the caps (13, 17) in the initial position of the

latter and in that in the aforesaid second position, the pin (18) is abutting upon the
bottom of the slot (20) of the casing (3) for blocking against rotation the cap with the

smaller dimension (17).
Device according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the cap with the
greater dimension (13) comprises two angularly and axially offset openings (13a, 13b)

corresponding to two outlets (6, 7), respectively, of the casing (3).
Device according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the cap with the
smaller dimension (17) is held in the initial position of closing of the outlets (6, 7) of

the casing (3) by a raised edge (24) thereof bearing upon a wall (3c) of the casing (3)
defining the outlet (5) open in this position.
Device according to one of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that both caps (13, 17)
comprise slits (25, 26), respectively, intended to direct a secondary air flux in a

different direction from a selected outlet (5, 7) of the casing (3).
