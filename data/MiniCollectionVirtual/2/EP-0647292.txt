<DESCRIPTION>
 CYLINDER FOR A RECIPROCATING HERMETIC COMPRESSORField of the InventionThe present invention refers to a cylinder for a reciprocating hermetic compressor of the type used in small refrigerating systems. Background of the InventionIn the reciprocating hermetic compressors, the reciprocating motion of a piston inside a cylindrical cavity, such as a cylinder provided in the cylinder block of said hermetic compressors, define suction and compression strokes of refrigerant gas during each operative cycle of the piston. In these operative cycles, the refrigerant gas is aspirated from a suction chamber towards the cylinder inside, through a suction orifice provided on a valve plate, during the suction stroke and it is discharged during the compression stroke from the inside of the cylinder to a discharge chamber, through a discharge orifice provided on said valve plate.The suction and compression strokes of the operative cycle of the reciprocating piston are defined by the stroke end positions of said piston, respectively known as upper dead point position and lower dead point position.In these compressors, the cylinder, within which reciprocates the piston, presents a constant cylindricity throughout its length, said cylindricity defining, in a transversal profile, walls that are parallel to the respective walls of a reciprocating piston mounted inside said cylinder. The radial distance between the cylinder wall and the piston wall is calculated in order to be sufficient to receive, by superficial adherence, a lubricant oil film that reduces the friction between the walls of the cylinder and reciprocating piston, mainly when said piston comes 

closer to the upper dead point, where the pressure rises quickly with the advance of the reciprocating piston.In these constructions, with the pressure rise inside the cylinder during compression, there is an increase in the leakage of gas that is being compressed to the inside of the compressor shell and, consequently, to the low pressure portion of the refrigerating system, through a radial clearance existing between the adjacent walls of the cylinder and reciprocating piston.A reduction in the radial clearance between the cylinder and piston walls, from the lower dead point up to the upper dead point, though reducing the problem of gas leakage during compression, contributes to reduce the mechanical efficiency of the compressor, due to power losses by friction caused by the motion of said piston in relation to the oil film.
