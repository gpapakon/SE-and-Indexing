<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to capacitive probe
boards and connectors, and more particularly but not
exclusively to fully-shielded, edge-card connectors for
use with capacitive proximity probes and like devices.The difficult measurement problem of determining the size
of thin gaps in machinery and machine parts is presently
addressed by such means as mechanical feeler gauges and thin
capacitive proximity probes. Electronic measurement devices
are preferred over mechanical means, since electronic
measurement devices typically avoid the contact between the
probe and the workpiece, often required by mechanical
devices. Electronic devices also yield significantly higher
measurement accuracy.To achieve maximum sensitivity and range with a given
probe size, capacitive probes may employ a shielded signal
path from the sensing region of the probe to an apparatus for
generating and receiving probe signals. Thus, one area of
significant development in the capacitive probe art is that
of providing adequate shielding of connections between the
probe and associated cable. One capacitive probe of the
prior art, which is shown in Figure 1, receives signal and
shield conductors in a soldered connection 100 to a shielded
coaxial cable 107. However, the configuration of Figure 1
does not provide any shielding of the exposed portions of the
signal conductors 101, the signal trace 103 or below the
sensing region 105. Coaxial cable 107 is provided with a
braided shield 109 for shielding signal conductor 101 up to a
region 110 where signal conductor 101 is exposed to permit
formation of the soldered connection 100 between signal 
conductor 101 and plated through hole 111. Ambient noise
signals may impinge on region 110, thus introducing noise, or
region 110 may couple a signal carried on signal conductor
101 to an undesired point, because of the lack of shielding
in region 110. Braided shield 109 is connected by a second
solder joint to plated through hole 113 for forming a
connection with shield trace 115. Shield trace 115 provides
some shielding for the signal trace 103 and the sensing
region 105 in a direction co-planar with those traces.
However, as described above, no shielding is provided below
signal trace 103 or sensing region 105, or above signal trace
103. Thus, the above described prior art does not provide
maximum sensitivity or accuracy, since signal leaked from
signal trace 103, for example, will be interpreted as part of
the signal at sensing region 105. Furthermore, ambient noise
signals
