<DESCRIPTION>
_10- 1 - Too Short: Process of Preparing 3-AcylandrostadienesThe present invention relates to an improved 15 process for the preparation of substituted steroidal dienes. Such compounds are described in US Patent No, 5,017,568, issued on May 21, 1991 to Holt et al., as being useful in inhibiting steroid 5-α-reductase.Background of the Invention20Processes for the preparation of substituted steroidal diene derivatives, have previously been described. In particular the use of oxalyl bromide to convert steroidal α,β-unsaturated-3-ketones to 3-bromo- 25 3,5-diene intermediates (in 40% yield) followed by catalytic or alkyllithium mediated carboxylation (in 15% yield when N-butyl lithium was used) to yield steroidal-. < 3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives is reported in US Patent No. 5,017,568.30In addition to a low overall yield, another shortcoming of this disclosure is that oxalyl bromide is a toxic, expensive liquid which is difficult to store 

and is not commercially available in the bulk amounts needed for an industrial process.The use of oxalyl chloride to halogenate steroidal α,β-unsaturated ketones to chloro-steroidal dienes proceeds with only marginal results. Furthermore, the relatively low reactivity of the resultant chloro substituent poses non-trivial synthetic considerations in subsequent transformations. Thus, there is a need in the art for a safe, economical and reliable method to convert steroidal α, β-unsaturated ketones to their corresponding carboxylic acid-1, 3-dienes derivatives.This invention relates to a process for the fluorosulphonylation of multiple functional groups on the same molecule.This invention specifically relates to a process for the simultaneous fluorosulphonylation and amidation of 3-one- -ene-17-carboxylic acid steroidal compounds.This invention specifically relates to an improved process for the preparation of N-t-butyl-androst-3, 5- diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid.In a further aspect of the invention there are provided novel intermediates useful in the presently invented process. Detailed, Description o,f the,. InventionBy the term "simultaneous" as used herein is meant that the transformation of the steroidal 3-one to 3- fluorosulphonyl and 17-carboxylic acid to 17-carboxamide is performed in a single reaction without the isolation of an intermediate. 

 As used above and throughout the remainder of the specification and claims the carbons of the steroid nucleus are numbered and the rings are lettered as follows:Pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
