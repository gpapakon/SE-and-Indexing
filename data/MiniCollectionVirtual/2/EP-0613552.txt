<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure pressure, it is necessary to put the pressure transducer in spatial relation with the measurement media. For that purpose, the measurement transducer is provided with metallic or non-metallic process connecting flanges. The disadvantage of the state-of-the-art is that the metallic flanges very often are not resistant against the aggressivity and/or corrosivity of the measurement media. Non-metallic process connecting flanges are resistant against such media, but are not dimensionally stable at high process temperatures. It is therefore proposed to arrange a process connecting journal made of measurement media-resistant polymeric plastics in the metallic process connecting flange, so that the measurement media can only get in contact with the resistant plastic and the temperature-dependent dimensional stability of the plastic part is ensured by the metallic flange which supports it in the axial and radial directions.

<CLAIMS>
a) A metallic process connection flange (4) for a pressure sensor (2, 3) with a separable
connection (10, 11) by which the metallic process

connection flange (4) is positively connected with
the pressure sensor (2, 3), and
b) with nonmetallic connecting means of plastic in the
form of a male process connection (6) which are

resistant to the media to be measured and are
supported axially on a shoulder (44) and radially

on a circumferential surface (47) of the process
connection flange (4);
c) with a cylindrical hollow space (62) formed on the
male process connection (6) and closed with a

measured-media-resistant diaphragm (21) of the
pressure sensor,
d) via which diaphragm (21) the measuring cell (2) of
the pressure sensor is physically connected with

the media whose pressure is to be measured,
e) the cylindrical hollow space (62) being sealed from
the interior space of the measuring-cell housing

(3), and the measuring-cell housing (3) being
sealed from the environment; 
f) the process connection flange (4) resting with
the bottom of a groove (45) against an annular

surface of the measuring-cell housing (3), with
a sealing ring interposed therebetween, and the

male process connection (6) resting with a
sealing surface (69) against an annular sealing

surface of the diaphragm (21) of the measuring
cell (2), with a further sealing ring (13)

interposed therebetween.
A process connection flange as claimed in claim 1
wherein the internal thread (42) of the process

connection flange (4) and the external thread (66) of the
male process connection (6) form a screw joint by which

the male process connection (6) is fitted and held in the
process connection flange (4).
A process connection flange as claimed in claim 1
wherein the male process connection (6) is made of

polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).
