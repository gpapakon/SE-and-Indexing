<ABSTRACT>
Process for supplying nitrogen to a site whose consumption varies within a given range situated above a nominal flow rate, including the following stages:   a) compressed air is passed by an air compressor (2) via the upstream part of a main line (1) into a separation unit consisting of at least two membrane separation lines (4, 5) fitted in parallel, each comprising a membrane separator (6, 7), it being possible for at least one of the separation lines to be isolated from the main line by means for isolation (8, 9, 34) while adopting a configuration making it possible, depending on whether the flow rate needs of the site are at the level of the nominal flow rate or exceed a predetermined flow rate, to keep all the lines of the separation unit in service or to isolate at least one of the lines (5) of the separation unit; b) the gas obtained as waste from each of the membrane separators in service in stage a) is directed to a manifold (10), itself connected downstream to a downstream part of the main line; c) the gas obtained from the permeate side of each of the membrane separators in service in stage a), which is enriched in oxygen, is discarded towards the outer atmosphere of directed towards a user station requiring the use of such an oxygen-enriched gas; d) the gas originating from the manifold (10) is conveyed along the downstream part of the main line towards at least one user station (32) via a device (11) for controlling the flow rate delivered by the manifold (10), which, if appropriate, increases or decreases this flow rate.

Process for providing nitrogen to a site of which the
consumption varies within a given range situated above a

nominal flow rate, comprising the following steps:

a) air compressed by an air compressor (2) is passed via
the upstream part of a main line (1), in a separation

assembly consisting of at least two membrane separation
lines (4,5) mounted in parallel, each including a membrane

separator (6,7), at least one of the separation lines being
capable of being isolated from the main line by isolating

means (8,9,34), by adopting, as the case may be, one of the
following configurations :
a1) When the flow requirements of the site are situated at
the normal flow rate level, all the membrane separators of

the separation assembly are in service, none of the
separation lines being isolated;
a2) When the flow requirements of the site exceed a
predetermined flow rate, at least one of the lines (5) of

the separation assembly is isolated, while keeping at least
one separation line (4) and its membrane separator in

service;
b) The gas obtained from the discharge side of each of the
membrane separators of step a) in service is directed onto

a collector (10), itself connected downstream to a
downstream part of the main line;
c) The gas obtained from the permeate side of each of the
membrane separators of step a) in service, enriched in

oxygen, is discharged to the outside atmosphere or directed
towards a user station requiring the use of such a gas

enriched in oxygen;
d) The gas delivered by the collector (10) is conveyed
along the downstream part of the main line towards at least 

one user station (32) via a device (11) for controlling the
flow rate delivered by the collector (10) which increases

or reduces this flow rate as required.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that when
the flow rate requirements of the site pass beyond the

predetermined flow rate of step a2), a phase a3) is entered

characterized in that the said flow rate is regulated

during step d).
