<ABSTRACT>
Light-into-heat power generator, convector and materials converting systems, voltage distribution systems and light-into-heat motor system. With one or more light sources which are located in a container sealed in an airtight fashion, compounds of all types are converted and the internal energy of the compounds is released and given up as heat to the container wall. The heat can be used to generate steam, hot water, heating water and hot service water for further use. The areas of use are as follows:     - power stations   - refuse-burning (refuse-fired) power stations   - heating boilers   - district heating power stations   - destruction of poisons and pollutants   - plastics waste recycling and power generation   - nuclear (radioactive) waste   - irradiated waste   - and others.   The efficiency can amount to several 100%, depending on the power used. No emissions are released, since the process is conducted at underpressure. Furthermore, compounds are converted into other compounds (materials) in the container after one treatment. By supplying air, it is also possible to gasify compounds and use the gases in another way. What has previously been said also applies to plastics and other organic substances for hydrogen treatment and use. The voltage distribution and light-into-heat motor system consists of two discs which are each fitted with seven magnets. A disc is equipped in each case with poles which are arranged differently with respect to one another, with the polarity successively alternating. The magnets are arranged running exactly counter in the case of the second disc. The discs are mounted on a shaft, freely in each case. A pole magnet with a wheel is arranged at a distance from the rear axle in each case. The two discs are arranged in such a way that they can be displaced relative to one another in order to start counterrotating. In this way, the torque can, in a manner resembling a gyroscope, be used to drive machines, devices, motor vehicles etc., without emissions being released and without feeding in external energy unless this is a self-supplied battery feed. The light source in the container (with compounds) is ignited by a battery and, depending on the light source, control devices required (including ballast). Internal energy (voltage) released by the decomposition process of the compounds has the effect of continuously increasing the temperature in the container. The increase in temperature and the increasing withdrawal of oxygen causes the build-up of an ever stronger underpressure. This underpressure force is utilised in order (lacuna) thereby back-pressure elements as well as pistons or back-pressure rotors inter alia Wankel engine, the suction force of the elements being converted into a rotary movement. Units (sets), inter alia a power generator can be driven by couplings and gears. The flowing current of the generator is used to charge the battery, a further partial current is used to feed the light source or ballast. The residual generator current can be used to feed into the network (grid) or to drive other units. In a space which is fitted with a UV radiator subjected to a vacuum, refuse present in the space or on components is destroyed or decomposed by the UV radiator. The energy content of the radiators is dissipated in heat to the outer boundary of the space, which if necessary must be cooled. It is also possible to arrange magnetic fields which absorb the voltage modules (cores) released. The temperature is thus reduced and can be controlled. It is necessary to cool (cooling jacket or others) in the case of steel containers and others where the radiators or the material is fully enclosed. The energy content of the waste heat can then be used for other purposes. The beam gun consists of a container, round or similar, the material of which is produced from ceramic or similar. The interior space is evacuated (vacuum). A spider is connected in the interior space of the container to a bolt which has a through bore. The material of the spider and the bolt consists of highly compressed and highly conductive material (such as copper, industrial silver, platinum etc.). Furthermore, light sources, which are accommodated in the vacuum of the container, are in a dedicated vacuum, are arranged in the container. The light sources are UV, halogen radiators or the like. The remaining cavity of the container is filled with compounds with a high surface area (steel wool or other similar). A laser is mounted behind the container in such a way that the laser beam can shoot precisely through the bore of the laser. By switching on the light sources (critical masses), the compounds (steel wool, silver, aluminium or the like) are converted into energised form, that is to say the outer shell of the nuclear material is removed. The voltage produced in the process is loaded in the container and in the spider (the charge can amount to several million volts). The discharge is performed by briefly switching on the laser while simultaneously connecting the laser beam at the target to earth. This puts us in the position of generating artificial lightning of several million volts (energy storage). It is likewise possible to reduce the current permanently by using voltage converters. We are thus in possession of an inexhaustible energy source.
