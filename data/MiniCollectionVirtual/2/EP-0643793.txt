<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOWOUT PREVENTER OPENING MECHANISMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to blow out preventers and more specifically to apparatus for equalizing pressures above and below the closure members or rams in a blow out preventer (B.O.P.) prior to opening the rams. After such equalization occurs, the rams can move more easily to their open positions because there is no pressure differential urging them transverse to their path of movement. This allows a smaller operator to be used for opening the rams. The ram seals are subject to less friction and enjoy a longer life. Such equalization prevents damage to the rams or blow out preventer cavity which may occur if the rams are somewhat cocked due to the pressure differential at the time they are forced open.2. Description of the Prior ArtA number of prior patents describe schemes for attempting to ease the opening of blowout preventers by equalizing pressures in two different zones, typically using a bypass passageway which extends through at least one of the rams. However, such pressure equalization mechanisms have frequently been prone to intermittent leakage, are often mechanically complicated, and sometimes do not equalize at the optimum time or between optimum zones. Some prior devices, such as that shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,638,972 to Jones et al and that shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,036,807 to Lucky, do not equalize the pressures in the well bore above and below the rams, but rather, equalize the pressure above the rams with that behind or laterally outwardly of the rams. This does reduce the pressure which must be overcome to open the rams, but does not eliminate the 

aforementioned problem of a higher pressure downhole urging the rams upwardly, i.e. transverse to their path of movement. Thus, these systems do not reduce the amount of force necessary to open the rams as much as they might, and they also fail to eliminate problems with wear of the rams, their seals, and the surfaces of theirhousing cavities.The Jones et al system, and at least some of the embodiments of the Lucky systems, also suffer disadvantages in that the valve which opens and closes the bypass passageway seats and seals in an axial direction (with respect to its direction of motion). Thus, a slight flaw in the valve or valve seat, or their alignment when seated, can easily cause leakage. Likewise, a little debris on the valve element or valve seat (a not unlikely occurrence when well fluid must, of necessity, enter the bypass

 AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 26 October 1993 (26.10.93); original claim 16 amended; new claims 17-19 added; other claims unchanged (2 pages)]
16. A blowout preventer comprising: a blowout preventer housing having a central bore therethrough, cavity means intersecting said central bore, and an actuator cylinder communicating with said cavity
means; closure members disposed within said cavity means for movement toward and away from each other between an open position and a closed position closing said central bore and dividing said central bore into upper and lower zones respectively above and below said closure members; at least one of said closure members having a bypass passageway therethrough, said bypass passageway having first and second ends disposed to allow communication between said upper and lower zones through said bypass passageway, and having an annular sealing surface intermediate said ends; an actuator piston disposed within said actuator cylinder; an actuator shaft extending inwardly from said actuator piston and having an inner end received in said one closure member for limited lost motion type relative reciprocal movement; a seal carrier disposed in said one closure member and surrounding an inner portion of said shaft for lateral play therebetween and having a valve member thereon adapted for sealing engagement with said sealing surface of said bypass passageway.
17. The apparatus of Claim 16, further comprising: a circumferential seal carried on said valve member.
18. The apparatus of Claim 16, wherein: said valve member is reciprocal into and out of said sealing section. 


 19. A blowout preventer, comprising: a blowout preventer housing having a central bore therethrough and defining cavity means intersecting said central bore; closure members disposed within said cavity means for movement toward and away from each other between an open and a closed position closing said central bore and dividing said central bore into upper and lower zones respectively above and below said closure members; at least one of said closure members having a bypass passageway therethrough, said bypass passageway having first and second ends and having a sealing section intermediate said ends; a sealing piston reciprocable in said bypass passageway into and out of said sealing section; an actuator shaft associated with said one closure member via a lost motion connection for so moving said closure member between said open and closed positions and carrying said sealing piston for joint motion with said shaft, relative movement between said shaft and said closure member in said lost motion connection, when moving toward said closed position, first moving said sealing piston into said sealing section, and when moving toward said open position, first moving said sealing piston out of said sealing section; and a seal carrier carrying said sealing piston and loosely surrounding an inner portion of said shaft for lateral play therebetween.
