<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette includes a pair of cassette 
halves and a pair of hubs enclosed between the cassette 

halves, and about which a recording medium, or tape can be 
wound. Each cassette half includes a first moulded body 

and a second moulded body overlying it. The first moulded 
body has a first principal surface and a first upstanding 

wall which is perpendicular to the principal surface and 
forms an integral part thereof and a part of a peripheral 

surface of the half. The second moulded body has a second 
principal surface which is generally rectangular and 

overlies the first principal surface, and a second 
upstanding wall connected to the first upstanding wall to 

form the peripheral surface of the half therewith, forming 
an integral part of the second principal surface and 

surrounding it. The first and second upstanding walls are 
connected by a junction having a thickness increasing 

gradually across the thickness of the half.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette
and, more particularly, to a cassette half having a two-layer
structure and a tape cassette formed by a pair of
such cassette halves.There is known a cassette for e.g. a sound
recording and reproducing tape which includes a pair of
cassette halves fitted together, and a pair of reel hubs
which are enclosed between the cassette halves, and on
which the tape can be wound. Each cassette half may have
a two-layer structure as shown at 101 in FIG. 1 of the
accompanying drawings, and include an inner resin layer
102 formed from a resin having a low modulus of
elasticity, and an outer resin layer 103 formed from a
resin having a high modulus of elasticity on the inner
resin layer 102, as shown in FIGS. 1 to 3. The inner
resin layer 102 improves the vibration-damping property of
the cassette half.The cassette half 101 is formed by injection
moulding the inner resin layer 102 in a mould, and the
outer resin layer 103 on the outer surface of the inner
resin layer 102. The outer resin layer 103 has a thin
portion 104 lying on the inner resin layer 102, and a
thick portion 105 contiguous to the thin portion 104, both
as viewed across the thickness of the cassette half.Each cassette half 101 has in the principal
surface a pair of holes 107 through which the reel shafts,
respectively, of a tape recording and/or reproducing
apparatus can be inserted, as shown in FIG. 1. The two
cassette halves 101 are joined together by screws, etc. to
assemble a tape cassette 111, as shown in FIG. 1. Each
cassette half 101 has in one of its edge surfaces a 
plurality of cuts which enable the cassette 111 to have a
plurality of openings 108 through which the tape can be
partly exposed, and into which the heads, pinch rollers,
etc. of the recording and/or reproducing apparatus can be
inserted. Reel hubs 109 and 110 partly project into the
holes 107, respectively, and are rotatable by the reel
shafts passed through the holes 107.The outer resin layer 103 of each cassette half
101 has, however, an abrupt change in thickness between
its thin and thick portions 104 and 105, as FIG. 2 shows
that the thick portion 105 has an end surface 106 which is
substantially perpendicular to the thin portion 104, or
has an angle  of about 90° thereto. The shape of the
outer resin layer 103 as described is apparently responsible
for the problems which will be pointed out below:
(1) When the outer resin layer 103 hardens
after injection moulding, its shrinkage occurs to a
greatly different degree between
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cassette half-case comprising:

an inner moulded layer (32,74); and
an outer moulded layer (33,75) formed by injection
moulding over said inner moulded layer (32,74), wherein

said inner moulded layer forms a first moulded body
(32,74) having as integral parts a first principal

surface (32a) and a first upstanding wall which is
substantially perpendicular to said principal surface

(32a) and forms part of a peripheral surface of said
half-case; and said outer moulded layer forms a second

moulded body (33,75) having as integral parts a second
principal surface (33a) which is generally rectangular

and overlies said first principal surface, and a second
upstanding wall forming the remainder of the peripheral

surface of said half-case and connected to said first
upstanding wall at a junction:
 
   wherein the height of the first and

second upstanding walls changes gradually along the
junction in a complementary way whereby the junction is

inclined to the plane of the principal surfaces.
A cassette half-case according to claim 1, wherein
said junction (78) has a surface inclined across the

height of said half.
A cassette half-case according to claim 1, wherein
said junction (30) has an arcuate surface curved across

the height of said half.
A cassette half-case according to any preceding
claim further comprising:

   means (41) formed in said first principal surface
(32a) for holding the first moulded body against

separation from a mould half after moulding, said means
being defined by a plurality of discrete concavities (41)

so arranged as to form the boundary of an area including 
portions corresponding to gates of a mould for the

material of said first moulded body (32).
A tape cassette comprising a pair of cassette halves
each according to any preceding claim, and a pair of hubs

(3,4) enclosed between said halves, and about which a
recording medium in tape form can be wound.
A tape cassette according to claim 5 wherein said
first principal surface (32a) includes a smooth surface

(N) on which said hubs are supported.
A tape cassette according to claim 5 or 6 wherein
each of said halves is provided with a sheet member (6,7)

interposed between its inner surface and said hubs (3,4),
and having a portion contacting said hubs (3,4), and said

first moulded body (32) has a smooth surface (N)
contacting said hub contacting portion of said sheet

member (6,7).
A tape cassette according to claim 6 or 7, wherein 
said smooth surface is obtained by non-roughening

treatment.
