<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and a method for measuring the complex dielectric constant of a material by evaluating the detuning of an RF resonator, caused by the presence of the material. In order to simplify the measuring and evaluation circuits, and in order to allow continuous measurement of a material flow, according to the invention two RF resonators (8, 8') with the same design are present, which respectively have a dielectric solid-state resonator (1, 1') in a housing, with a first conductive section (2, 2') and a second section (3, 3') which allows transmission of AC fields. The two RF resonators are positioned relative to each other in such a way that their conductive housing sections (2, 2') screen them against mutual interference and their sections (3, 3') which allow transmission of electromagnetic fields face the material (10) to be measured. The operating frequency coupled into the two RF resonators and/or the resonant frequencies of the RF resonators (8, 8') are chosen in such a way that, in the absence of the material to be measured, the common operating frequency is located exactly centrally between the resonant frequencies of the RF resonators (8, 8'). On the basis of the measured amplitude values of the RF signals respectively received in the two RF resonators, and the values of their sum and difference, the complex dielectric constant of the material can be determined. It is therefore not necessary to sweep the resonant curves of the RF resonators.
