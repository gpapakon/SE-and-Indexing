<ABSTRACT>
A cable holder for wiring in low-voltage circuits of electrical apparatuses has a continuous duct (5), which is constructed on a moulding, for accommodating the cables. The duct is designed for a cable laying tool, which projects through its lateral cable insertion opening and moves in the cable longitudinal direction, such that it can be passed through over its length, limbs (3) and/or cable hold-back means (7), which bound the duct at the side, being constructed such that they temporarily deflect the tool passing through in a resiliently elastic manner.

Wire retainer for connecting wires in low-Voltage 
circuit of electrical apparatus, having a base (1; 21) 

provided with fasteners and having at least two legs 
(3; 26) joined thereto, between which a continuous 

channel (5; 25) receiving the wires is defined, said 
channel being open on one side over its length to form 

a wire insertion opening and being assigned spring-elastic 
hold-back means (7, 11; 27, 28; 270, 280) for 

wires received in the channel, these hold-back means normally 
being in a position that defines the free through 

cross-section of the channel and/or the lateral wire 
insertion opening, characterised in that the channel 

(5, 25) is designed so that a tool (10) protruding 
through the insertion opening and moving in the 

longitudinal direction of the wire can pass through it 
over its length, and that the legs (3; 26) defining 

the channel and/or the hold-back means (7, 11; 27, 28; 
270, 280) are formed so as to momentarily yield 

spring-elastically to the tool passing through. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it has at least a holding member (7; 27, 28; 270,280) 

which at least partially protrudes over the wire 
insertion opening and which is formed and/or supported 

to yield spring-elastically. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the holding member has a flexible tongue or 

strip (27, 28; 7) supported laterally of the wire 
insertion opening.  

 
Wire retainer according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that a flexible tongue or strip (27, 28; 7) is located 

on each side of the channel (5, 25). 
Wire retainer according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the two tongues (27, 28) are formed with their 

free ends overlapping one another. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised 
in that each tongue (27, 28; 270, 280) is formed as a 

thin small plate standing on edge. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the channel (25) has at 

least one pocket-like enlargement (34), the inside 
width of which is less than or equal to the outside 

diameter of the wire. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the channel (25) is subdivided 

longitudinally by at least one separator 
member (35) protruding from the bottom. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the channel (25) extends 

through a shaped part (24), which is joined to the 
base (21) and containing the legs (26) and is formed 

essentially as a plate oriented transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the channel. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it has spring-elastic 

clamping means (11) adjoining the channel (5) on at 
least one face end for wires (6) placed in the  

 
channel. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the clamping means have at least one spring-elastic 

clamping bow (11), which extends over the 
height of the channel (5) and, with a clamping bow 

(11) or an abutment opposite it, defines a clamping 
site. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that the clamping site is defined, at least on one 

side, by a clamping edge (12) on a clamping bow (11) 
or on the abutment. 
Wire retainer according to one of Claims 11 or 12, 
characterised in that a clamping bow (11) and/or the 

abutment has an insertion slope (20) pointing inwards 
in a funnel-like manner for the placement tool (6). 
Wire retainer according to one of Claims 11 to 13, 
characterised in that the clamping bow (11) has a wall 

portion rolled inwards essentially in partially 
cylindrical manner. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 14, characterised in 
that the wall portion rolled inwards in partially 

cylindrical form is located on a retaining arm (13) 
joined to the base (1) or to a leg (3), with which arm 

it is joined over at least a portion of its height. 
Wire retainer according to Claim 15, characterised in 
that the retaining arm (13) is separated from the 

adjacent leg (3) by a slit (16), which extends over at 
least a portion of the height of the leg (3).  

 
Wire retainer according to one of Claims 2 to 16, 
characterised in that the holding member (7) located 

on at least one leg (3) has on its face end an 
insertion slope (70) pointing inwards in a funnel-like 

manner for the tool. 
Wire retainer according to one of Claims 2 to 17, 
characterised in that the holding member (7) located 

on at least one leg (3) and/or possibly the clamping 
means (11) are formed with an insertion slope (8; 17) 

inclined towards the channel bottom for the wires. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the base (1) has an 

aperture leading into the channel (5) (Figure 2). 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that fasteners (2) located on 

the base (1, 21) are formed to be secure against 
relative rotation. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a code (40) readable 

from the outside is located on the base (1, 21) or on 
some part joined to it. 
Wire retainer according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it is formed in one 

piece from a plastic.
