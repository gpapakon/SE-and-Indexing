<ABSTRACT>
Encapsulated liquid crystal is deposited onto an electrode by providing a substrate having an electrode pattern thereon; placing the substrate and the electrode pattern in contact with an electrodeposition medium comprising a liquid crystal composition, a containment medium or precursor therefor, and optionally a carrier medium; and depositing encapsulated liquid crystal material comprising the liquid crystal composition dispersed in the containment medium onto the electrode pattern or selected portions thereof by applying a voltage to the electrode pattern or selected portions thereof. The coated substrate-electrode combination can then be made into displays, privacy screens, signs, architectural partitions, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of applying encapsulated liquid 
crystal material to electrode surfaces by electrodeposition. Liquid crystal displays ("LCD's") and other devices in which the electro-optically 
active element comprises liquid crystal material are well known. One type of device employs an encapsulated liquid crystal structure in 
which a liquid crystal composition is encapsulated or dispersed in a 
containment medium such as a polymer. When a voltage corresponding to a 
sufficiently strong electric field is applied via an electrode across the encapsulated 
liquid crystal structure (the "field-on" condition), the alignment of the 
liquid crystal molecules therein is re-oriented in accordance with the field, so 
that incident light is transmitted. Conversely, in the absence of such a voltage 
(the "field-off" condition) the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is 
random and/or influenced by the liquid crystal-matrix interface, so that the 
structure scatters and/or absorbs incident light. The applied voltage at which 
the structure changes from its field-off condition to its field-on condition is 
generally referred to as the threshold voltage. Such devices can be used in 
displays, architectural partitions, automobile sun-roofs, privacy screens, and 
signs. Generally, the encapsulated liquid crystal material is applied to a 
substrate-electrode combination in a fluid, spreadable precursor form and 
allowed to convert to its final form by evaporation of a solvent or carrier 
medium, by a chemical reaction such as polymerization, or by a physical 
change such as solidification upon cooling. An alternative method is to 
prepare a film or sheet of encapsulated liquid crystal material and then 
laminate it to the substrate-electrode combination. Fergason, US 4,435,047 (1984), discloses making an encapsulated liquid 
crystal device by preparing an emulsion comprising liquid crystals, a 
containment medium, and a carrier medium, laying a layer of the emulsion 
onto a substrate-supported electrode, and allowing the emulsion to dry.  
 Doane et al., US 4,688,900 (1987), discloses the preparation of 
encapsulated liquid crystal devices by applying a combination of 
unpolymerized containment medium precursor monomer and liquid crystal 
onto a substrate/electrode and polymerizing the monomer. West et al., US 4,685,771 (1987), discloses the preparation of encapsulated 
liquid crystal devices by a solvent- or temperature-induced phase separation 
technique. The prior art methods have a number
