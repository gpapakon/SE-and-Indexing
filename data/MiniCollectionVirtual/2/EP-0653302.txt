<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for controlling the operating parameters of a forme inking roller (1) in a printing unit of an offset rotary printing machine, having at least one driven forme cylinder (2) which is driven by a main drive and bears at least one printing forme, and having a swivel lever (12) which is linked at its one end to a point which is fixed relative to the printing-machine frame and whose second end is free. A forme inking roller which has a soft elastic surface is rotatably mounted and driven in the swivel lever. An adjusting stop (22) which can be adjusted by motor power bounds the swivel range of the swivel lever, and a pressing-on device presses the free end of the swivel lever (23) in the direction of the forme cylinder. The pressing-on forces forming the application strip width and the speeds of the forme inking roller and of the forme cylinder are recorded and transmitted to a computer to calculate a speed compensation for the forme inking roller and/or an adjustment path for the adjusting stop assigned to the swivel lever. The speed compensation calculated is transmitted as a setting signal for the forme inking roller to the auxiliary drive motor or the adjusting path for the swivel lever is transmitted as a setting signal to the adjusting stop.

A method for controlling the operation of a driven inking
roller (1) in relation to a driven forme cylinder (2), wherein

the roller has an elastic surface operating in the positioning
region against the forme cylinder with an effective radius and

a contact force, the rotational speed of the roller (1) and of
the forme cylinder (2) are detected and a required change of

the rotational speed of the roller is ascertained and the
rotational speed of the roller thereupon adjusted,

characterised in that

a) a resilient contact pressure means (23) presses the
roller (1) against adjusting stops (22) which are

adjustable by motor and movable into an adjusting
position to limit the positioning movement,
b) an actual value of the contact force of the roller (1)
against the forme cylinder (2) is measured and supplied to

a computer (19) which
c) compares this actual value with a desired value for the
contact force, ascertains the required change of the

contact force and controls adjustment of the adjusting
stops (22),
d) the computer ascertains with the adjusting position of
the adjusting stops the effective radius of the roller

and from the effective radius of the roller and the
rotational speed of the roller ascertains the

circumferential speed thereof, and from this produces a
correction signal to obtain the desired value of the

circumferential speed, and
e) this correction signal is passed to an actuating
arrangement to regulate the rotational speed of the roller

in relation to the rotational speed of the forme cylinder.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
rotational speed of the inking roller is additionally adjusted

as a function of the Shore hardness of the coating of the 
inking roller.
A printing unit for an offset rotary printing machine for
implementing the method according to claim 1, comprising


at least one inking roller (1) having an elastic surface,
a forme cylinder (2) designed to hold at least one printing
forme,
a drive arrangement (8, 15) for the roller and the forme
cylinder,

measuring device (20) and the means (20, 30) for adjusting

the adjusting stops, wherein
d) the computer is designed so that

the actual value of the contact force is compared with
a desired value for the contact force, a required

change of the contact force is ascertained and from
this an actuating signal to control the adjusting

position of the adjusting stops (22) is formed, and
from the adjusting position of the adjusting stops
