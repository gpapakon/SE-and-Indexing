<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for the reception 
of coded television signals, in which a television signal is 

coded so as that it cannot be received and reproduced in the 
normal way by normal television receivers, but only by 

receivers equipped with an appropriate decoder; the main 
characteristic of the invention consists in the fact that the 

system has a decoder to be connected to a normal receiver of 
television signals, that said decoder is equipped with a 

device for detecting the presence of a user and/or of said 
receiver, and that said decoder is not activated in the case 

that such presence is not detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for the reception
of coded television signals, in which a television signal is
coded so as that it cannot be received and produced in the
normal way by normal television receivers, but only by
receivers equipped with an appropriate decoder.It is known that distribution systems of television programs
upon payment are in use, in which the television signal
undergoes a coding (ciphering) in the broadcasting station,
so as to alter its characteristics; for receiving such
signals in a satisfactory manner a receiver is necessary
being equipped with an appropriate decoder (decipher), that
supplies the signal with its original characteristics, so as
to permit the visual and audio reproduction in a satisfactory
manner.It is also known the sale, by way of the producer of such
transmissions, of appropriate decoders to be connected to a
normal television signals receiver (television and/or video
recorder) with the aim of making them able to receive such
coded signals.One of the possible frauds committed against such producers
is that of buying a single decoder, which supplies, for
instance in the case of a central antenna unit, a 
considerable number of users.It is known from DE-U-9 207 985 a television set which is connectable to at least a
videorecorder and a decoder, for supplying to the recorder the signals coming from
the television set and from the decoder, wherein it is provided a recording mode for
the television set by which only the receiving part of the set are supplied with current.
It is also known from US-A-4802022 a CATV system for a guest facility such as an
hotel, including a monitor installed in each room, an activator for activating the monitor
and a sensor for detecting a guest who has entered the room and comes close to the
monitor, and a display controller for displaying guest information such as an hotel
guide when sensor detects the presence of the guest in proximity of the monitor. The aim of the present invention is that of indicating how it
is possible to realise a system for the reception of coded
television signals that eliminates or reduces such drawbacks
of the known systems.In view of realising such aims the present invention has as
its subject a system for the reception of coded television signals having the
characteristics indicated in the attached claim 1.The characteristics and advantages of the system according to
the invention will become clear from the following
description, executed with reference to the annexed drawings,
that are
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
System for the reception of coded television signals, in which a television
signal is coded so as that it cannot be received and reproduced in the normal way by

normal television receivers, but only by receivers equipped with an appropriate
decoder, characterised in that the system has a decoder (3) to be connected to a

normal receiver of television signals (2) that said decoder (3) comprises, besides the
said appropriate decoding circuit (4) of the television signal, one or more presence

detecting devices (6,8) and a control unit (5), connected to said decoding circuit (4)
and to said presence detecting devices (6, 8), and that the said decoding circuit (4) is

shut down by the said control unit (5) in the case that such presence is not detected
by said presence detecting devices (6, 8).
System for the reception of coded television signals,
according to claim 1, characterised in that said detection

device comprises an intrusion movement detector (6).

various kinds are connected among themselves in a logic
circuit comprising at least an OR gate and an AND gate.
System for the reception of coded television signals,
according to one or more of the previous claims,

characterised in that said decoder (3) is shut-down after a
determined period of time from its switching on, if within

that period of time the said presence is not detected.
System for the reception of coded television signals according to one or
more of the preceding claims, characterised in that said decoder (3) and said receiver
