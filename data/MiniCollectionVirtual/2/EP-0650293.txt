<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for the conversion of the frame frequency 
of a video signal of progressive scansion from 50 Hz to 75 Hz; 

the main characteristic of the method consists in the fact that 
a temporal redistribution of the original frames is provided 

and an interpolation of an additional frame every two 
originals. 
A second important characteristic of the described method 
consists in the fact that the interpolation provides a movement 

compensation; a movement vector is associated to every pixel of 
the frame to be interpolated; the values of the interpolated 

pixels are produced with an operation of average along the 
estimated path of movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The conversion of the frame frequency that represent the images 
of a video sequence is a subject that has called the attention 
of technicians due to the proliferation of the source types of 
signals and of the display formats being of different 
characteristics. The necessity for developing efficient methods for carrying out 
such conversions is particularly felt, both in the field of 
integration applications of television images in multimedia 
systems, and in the field of advanced television systems, with 
the aim of reducing a typical artefact (large area flicker) of 
the actual systems. In particular a conversion with a factor being equal to 1,5, 
i.e. from 50 Hz to 75 Hz, is generally considered sufficient, 
be it as the frequency of 75 Hz is close to that normally used 
in monitors of work stations, and also because such frequency 
results in supplying an acceptable compromise between the 
visual quality and the computational complexity. The aim of the present invention is therefore that of 
indicating a method for carrying out such conversion in an  
 
efficient manner, so as to obtain a satisfying image quality 
while maintaining the calculation complexity within acceptable 
limits. For reaching the intended aims, the invention has as its 
subject a method for the conversion of the frame frequency of a 
video signal from 50 Hz to 75 Hz, characterised in that a 
temporal redistribution is provided of the original frames and 
an interpolation of an additional frame every two originals. In a first preferred form of realisation the invention has as 
its subject a method for the conversion of the frame frequency 
of a video signal from 50 Hz to 75 Hz, further characterised in 
that said temporal redistribution provides that one of the two 
original frames is displayed 3,3 milliseconds before the 
instant that it occupied in the original sequence, and that the 
additional frame be interpolated in a central position between 
the two said original frames temporally displaced. In a second preferred form of realisation the invention has as 
its subject a method for the conversion of the frame frequency 
of a video signal of progressive scansion from 50 Hz to 75 Hz, 
further characterised in that said interpolation provides a 
movement compensation, which is a movement vector that is 
associated to every pixel of the frame that is to be 
interpolated and that the values of the interpolated pixels are 
produced with an operation of average along the estimated path 
of movement. Further characteristics and
