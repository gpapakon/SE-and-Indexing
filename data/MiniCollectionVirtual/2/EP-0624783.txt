<ABSTRACT>
A lens inspector has an objective lens composed by front 
and rear lenses, a two-dimensional image sensor and an image 

forming lens for forming a point image of light passing through 
the objective lens. A lens to be inspected is disposed between 

a light source and an object focal point of the objective lens. 
The light source projects a light bundle onto the test lens in 

parallel with the optical axis of the objective lens, and the 
front lens of the objective lens is moved along the optical 

axis so as to shift the object focal point of the objective 
lens stepwise into a plurality of positions within a 

predetermined range including a normal focal point of the test 
lens therein. Brightness data of a point image formed on the 

two-dimensional image sensor is detected for each shift 
positions of the objective lens, and is used for judgment as to 

whether an actual focal point of the test lens is within a 
proper range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lens inspector and a
lens inspection method for judging whether a focal point of a
lens is in a proper range, and more particularly to a lens
inspector and a lens inspection method which is suitable for
inspecting taking lenses of lens-fitted photographic film units
during the manufacturing of the film units.Focal length and optical axis may be recited as the most
fundamental factors which have effect on the performance of a
taking lens of a camera. In compact cameras and lens-fitted
photographic film units, taking lenses are mounted in main
housings. Therefore, if the taking lens is mounted to be
decentered in the camera, or if the spacing between lens
elements of the taking lens is incorrect, the optical axis or
the focal point will deviate from normal positions, which
results in insufficient optical properties of the taking lens.
As for other lenses, such as interchangeable lenses for
single-reflex cameras, may suffer the same trouble as above
when mounted in lens barrels.For this reason, some fundamental properties of lenses are 
inspected during or after the manufacture. In conventional lens
inspections, for example, modulation transfer function (MTF) is
measured, as is disclosed in JPA 55-20420 and JPA 58-118943, or
an aerial image of a test chart is observed through a
microscope. In alternative, an image of a test chart is picked
up as an image signal, and the image signal is analyzed.However, because a large scale apparatus and a long time
are necessary for MTF measurement, the lens inspection based on
the MTF is unsuitable for mass-produced lenses.In the microscopical observation of the test chart image,
because this is basically a visual inspection, the result of
inspection tends to have variations in accuracy, besides a long
time being necessary for inspection.Picking up the test chart image by a CCD camera and
analyzing the image signal in a computer also require a long
time. Therefore, the third method is also impractical for
inspecting mass-produced lenses at a high efficiency.In the JP 1107127 a method of determining the focal distance
of a lens is described, using a movable objective
lens which projects a spot cross-section on a CCD camera
if parallel light passes through the lens and the moveable
objective. The cross-section of the focal point on
the CCD is determined, using a CPU, as a function of the
position of said movable objective lens. The measurement
values are displayed on a LED display and the focal distance
can be obtained. However, this
