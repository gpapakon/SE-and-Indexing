<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for operating the valves of an internal combustion engine by means of a plurality of transmission elements (5, 6) for opening and closing the valves and with cams (3, 4) for the actuation of the transmission elements (5, 6), in which guide bores (10, 12), which can be brought into alignment, are arranged, into which at least one control pin (9), displaceable parallel to a control pin longitudinal axis, can be inserted, which has two faces (18, 19), the control pin (9) being selectively movable between adjacent guide bores (10, 12) for separating or connecting the transmission elements (5, 6) by means of an actuating device (8) and at least one control pin section (20, 21), adjoining that face (18, 19) of the control pin (9) which is insertable in the adjacent guide bore (10, 12), tapering towards the face (18, 19) - viewed from the centre of the control pin. In order to design a device of the generic type so that a reduction of the valve overlap and hence a reduction of the burnt working gas remaining in the cylinder at the end of the exhaust stroke can be achieved whilst maintaining reliable switching of the control pin (9) when the guide bores (10, 12) align, it is proposed according to the invention that the control pin (9) be of barrel-shaped design and that a maximum diameter be situated between the faces (18, 19) of the control pin, which forms a cylindrical fit with the guide bores (10, 12) with a play in the range of 1 - 60 mu m.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for operating valves in an internal combustion engine 
by means of several transfer elements to open and close the valves and with 

cams to actuate the transfer elements in which are located alignable guide 
bores into which can be inserted at least one indexing pin which can be moved 

in parallel with a longitudinal indexing pin axis, which indexing pin has two 
ends, whereby the indexing pin can be moved selectively ? back and forth 

between neighbouring guide bores in order to separate or connect the transfer 
elements by means of an actuation device, and whereby at least one section of 

the indexing pin adjacent to the end of the indexing pin which can be inserted 
into the neighbouring guide bore - when seen from the centre of the indexing 

pin - tapers towards the end, characterised in that the indexing pin (9, 9a) is 
shaped in the form of a barrel and the greatest diameter (D), which forms a 

cylindrical fit with the guide holes (10, 13, 13') with a play in the region of 
1 - 60 Âµm, lies between the ends (18) and (19) of the indexing pin (9, 9a). 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the guide 
bore (50) into which 
the end (18) of the indexing pin (9a) can be inserted has 
a convergent section (51) in the direction of insertion of the indexing pin (9a) 

which acts as a stop against which the indexing pin (9a) comes to rest when 
the transfer elements connect. 
An arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that the shape 
of the indexing pin (9a) and the shape of the convergent section (51) of the 

guide bore (50) are matched in such a manner that when the indexing pin (9a) 
comes to rest against the convergent section (51) when the transfer elements 

connect under load, the edges of the indexing pin (9a) and the convergent 
section (51) of the guide hole are in contact with each other.  

 
An arrangement according to Claim 2 or 3 characterised in that the 
outer surface of the convergent section (51) of the guide bore (50) is shaped 

like a truncated cone.
