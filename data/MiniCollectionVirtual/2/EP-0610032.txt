<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns acetanilide derivatives and more 
particularly acetanilide derivatives which are inhibitors of the enzyme 
5-lipoxygenase (hereinafter referred to as 5-LO). The invention also 
concerns processes for the manufacture of said acetanilide derivatives 
and novel pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Also included 
in the invention is the use of said acetanilide derivatives in the 
treatment of various inflammatory and/or allergic diseases in which the 
direct or indirect products of 5-LO catalysed oxidation of arachidonic 
acid are involved, and the production of new medicaments for such use. As stated above the acetanilide derivatives described 
hereinafter are inhibitors of 5-LO, which enzyme is known to be 
involved in catalysing the oxidation of arachidonic acid to give rise 
via a cascade process to the physiologically active leukotrienes such 
as leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄) and the peptido-lipid leukotrienes such as 
leukotriene C₄ (LTC₄) and leukotriene D₄ (LTD₄) and various 
metabolites. The biosynthetic relationship and physiological properties of 
the leukotrienes are summarised by G.W. Taylor and S.R. Clarke in 
Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 1986, 7, 100-103. The leukotrienes 
and their metabolites have been implicated in the production and 
development of various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as 
inflammation of the joints (especially rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract 
(especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and 
gastritis), skin disease (especially psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis) 
 and respiratory disease (especially asthma, bronchitis and allergic 
rhinitis), and in the production and development of various 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders such as myocardial 
infarction, angina and peripheral vascular disease. In addition the 
leukotrienes are mediators of inflammatory diseases by virtue of their 
ability to modulate lymphocyte and leukocyte function. Other 
physiologically active metabolites of arachidonic acid, such as the 
prostaglandins and thromboxanes, arise via the action of the enzyme 
cyclooxygenase on arachidonic acid.  It is disclosed in European Patent Application Nos. 0375457 
A2 and 0385679 A2 that certain heterocyclic derivatives possess 
inhibitory properties against 5-LO. Furthermore European Patent 
Applications Nos. 0409412, 0409413 and 0462812 are also concerned with 
heterocyclic derivatives which possess inhibitory properties against 
5-LO.
