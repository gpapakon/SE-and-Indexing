<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrostatographic toners suitable 
for use in a electrostatic developer, be it two component or 
monocomponent developers. In particular this invention relates to 
heat fixable electrostatographic colour toners suitable for use in a 
full colour printing system . It is well known in the art of electrographic printing and 
electrophotographic copying to form an electrostatic latent image 
corresponding to either the original to be copied, or corresponding 
to digitised data describing an electronically available image. In electrophotography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
the steps of uniformly charging a photoconductive member and 
imagewise discharging it by an imagewise modulated photo-exposure. In electrography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
imagewise depositing electrically charged particles, e.g. from 
electron beam or ionized gas onto a dielectric substrate. The obtained latent images are developed, i.e. converted into 
visible images by selectively depositing thereon light absorbing 
particles, called toner particles, which usually are 
triboelectrically charged. In toner development of latent electrostatic images two 
techniques have been applied : "dry" powder and "liquid" dispersion 
development of which dry powder development is nowadays most 
frequently used. In dry development the application of dry toner powder to the 
substrate carrying the latent electrostatic image may be carried out 
by different methods known as, "cascade", "magnetic brush", "powder 
cloud", "impression" or "transfer" development also known as 
"touchdown" development described e.g. by Thomas L. Thourson in IEEE 
Transactions on Electronic Devices, Vol. ED-19, No. 4, April 1972, 
pp.495-511. In most cases the latent image is developed with a finely 
divided developing material or toner to form a powder image which is 
then transferred onto a support sheet such as paper. The transferred image may subsequently be permanently affixed to  
 
the substrate by heat, pressure, or a combination of heat and 
pressure. Electrophotographic processes can not only be employed to form 
monochrome (black) images, but also to form colour images. It is 
known to form full colour images by sequentially forming and 
developing electrostatic colour separation images with cyan, 
magenta, yellow and black toners respectively. In such applications 
high quality toners are needed. By 'quality' in electrostatography is generally understood a 
true, faithful reproduction of the original to
