<ABSTRACT>
A loom contains a warp beam (1) and a weaving rotor (2) as well as an arrangement (3) for the warp run and an arrangement (4) for the fabric run which, in each case combined as a subassembly, are arranged in a machine frame (5). The arrangement (3) for the warp run and the arrangement (4) for the fabric run can be mounted in the frame (5) alternately with respect to a plane (27) defined by the axes of rotation (25, 26) of the warp beam (1) and of the weaving unit (2). This plane (27) constitutes a reference plane which defines the position of the arrangements (3) and (4) relative to one another and within the frame (5), so that a warp-module exchange can be carried out in a virtually unvaried way irrespective of the arrangement of the warp and fabric beams (1, 6).

Series-shed weaving machine having a warp beam (1) and a 
weaving rotor (2), characterised in that an arrangement 

(3) for the warp run and an arrangement (4) for the 
cloth run are in each case combined into a subassembly 

and are arranged in a machine frame (5), and in that, 
the arrangement (3) for the warp run and the arrangement 

(4) for the cloth run are alternatively mountable in the 
frame (5) with respect to a plane (27) which is 

determined by the rotational axes (25, 26) of the warp 
beam (1) and the weaving rotor (2). 
Weaving machine according to claim 1 having a cloth 
beam, characterised in that the cloth beam (6) is 

arranged in a second frame (7).

characterised by further means for the mounting of the 

cloth beam (6) to the frame (5). 
Weaving machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the arrangement (3) for the warp 

run is arranged above the plane (27); and in that the 
cloth beam (6) is arranged below the warp beam (1). 
Weaving machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the arrangement (3) for the warp 

run is arranged above the plane (27); and in that the 
cloth beam (6) is arranged on the weaving side and at a  

 
distance from the weaving rotor (2).
