<ABSTRACT>
Smoothing of regenerated pictures (e.g. after a heavy signal compression and coding for transmission on a narrowband medium) can be effected by means of a so-called "cosmetics filter", which filter comprises a lowpass filter, a delay means, a subtraction unit, a table means and an adder. The filtered signal is output from the adder, said adder receiving an address content from the table means and a lowpass-filtered signal from the lowpass filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cosmetics
filter.In connection with electronic pictures like TV pictures,
noise is often a problem. The noise with which one is most
familiar, is what can be called thermal noise - or random
noise. It is possible to achieve clearer and cleaner pictures
if this type of noise is reduced somewhat.Attempts have therefore been made to find methods for a
reduction of this noise in the temporal domain by using
various filtering techniques, which will often be based upon a
type of recursive filter means. Examples of methods of such a
type of noise reduction can be found in e.g. British patent
application GB-A-2,020,941, US patent US-A-4,639,784, EP-A-0 267 786, and German
patent DE-C-33 11 898. All these patent publications are based
upon a temporal picture filtering, so that the filtered
picture will be less afflicted with noise, and hence present a
more pleasant appearance, and simultaneously the signal time
variation will not become veiled.Lately one has started to use digital compression
techniques to reduce bit consumption when representing single
pictures or picture sequences (live pictures). These are e.g.
techniques used in picture telephony. The coding technique
itself is standardized by the international telecommunication
organization CCITT. Live pictures are encoded in such a
manner that they do not need a higher network transmission
capacity than in the case of telephony. In order to succeed
in such a task, the live picture must be compressed to such a
degree that also visible distortion is introduced in the
picture. This distortion has the effect that the picture
looks a little less pleasant. In order to remedy this effect,
it is possible to apply a subsequent filtering of the picture
to give the picture a more pleasant appearance. Thus, a situation exists where a great deal of knowledge
exists regarding the generated noise. If one for example
utilizes blocks when encoding pictures, one knows as a
starting point that the block patterns will easily become
visible and disfiguring. This information regarding the type
of noise to be removed, becomes handy when the task is to
construct a subsequent filter, i.e. a cosmetics filter. The
goals to be achieved by means of such a filter can be summarized
in this manner:
A removal of the noise generated in the encoding
process, so that the result becomes subjectively pleasant to
the eye,taking care that scars from possible block magnitudes
in the encoding process will not become visible, andeffecting the filtering in such a

<CLAIMS>
A cosmetics filter for use in smoothing pictures which
are regenerated after signal compression and

coding, e.g. in connection with transmission of live pictures
in a narrowband transmission medium, where the pictures

are described by means of an input signal X constituted by digitally
sampled pixels,

the total filter
comprising a lowpass filter for the input signal X, a delay

means arranged in parallel thereto and for the same signal X,
a subtraction unit for providing the difference (X-XLOW)

between the lowpass-filtered signal (XLOW) and the delayed
signal X, a table means which utilizes said difference

(X-XLOW) as an input address value and
outputs a corresponding address content TAB (X-XLOW) in said

table means, to an adder which also receives said lowpass-filtered
signal XLOW, whereby the total-filtered signal

Y = XLOW + TAB(X-XLOW) results as output from said adder.
A filter in accordance with claim 1,
characterized in
 that the function of said
lowpass filter is to calculate an average value for a certain

number of picture points surrounding the point in question.
A filter in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterized in
 that said table means
contains a number N of pre-set tables to be selected when

controlling in accordance with the desired filtering degree,
where Y = XLOW + TAB
k
 (X-XLOW) where k = 1, 2, ... N.
A filter in accordance with one of claims 1-3,
characterized in
 that said lowpass filter is
adapted to operate in a horizontal or vertical direction in

the picture. 
A filter in accordance with one of claims 1-3,
characterized in
 that said lowpass filter is
adapted to operate in the temporal dimension of said picture,

i.e. e.g. by calculating a mean value at the same picture
point position over a number of consecutive pictures.
A filter in accordance with one of claims 1-3,
characterized in
 that said lowpass filter is
adapted to operate in both a horizonal and a vertical

direction simultaneously, i.e. e.g. by calculating a mean
value over a number of points in a picture block surrounding

the point in question.
A filter in accordance with one of claims 1-3,
characterized in
 that said lowpass filter is

adapted to operate simultaneously in both the temporal
dimension of the picture and a vertical and/or horizontal

direction.
A filter in accordance with claim 6 or 7,
characterized in
 that one single lowpass
filter executes the complete lowpass-filtering in one single

operation.
A filter in accordance with claim 6 or 7,
characterized in
 that two or three single
lowpass filters execute their own respective one-dimensional

lowpass filtering operation.
