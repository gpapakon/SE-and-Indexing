<ABSTRACT>
The rate of flow of water from a subterranean 
formation into a wellbore is reduced by introducing into the 

formation a self-crosslinking hydroxy unsaturated carbonyl 
compound monomer, and polymerizing it using an initiator. 

The initiator can be, for example, an azo compound which is 
temperature activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water flow control in 
a subterranean formation penetrated by a borehole. When performing various types of operations below 
the surface of the earth, a problem often encountered which 
can interfere with the operations is the undesirable flow of 
water from a subsurface formation into a work space or 
volume which penetrates the formation. Such operations can 
include, but are not limited to, mining operations, 
foundation construction, road and bridge construction, oil 
production and similar operations which require excavation 
into or penetration of earth structures having 
permeabilities conducive to the flow of water. Many attempts have been made to solve the problem 
of terminating, or at least reducing, the undesirable water 
flow. The proposed solutions have included, among other 
things, pumping unwanted water from the work space, erecting 
barriers, e.g. a casing, at the interface between the space 
and the formation to prevent the flow of water from the 
formation into the work space, and decreasing the 
permeability of the formation itself by introducing a 
material, e.g. a grout, into the formation. It is well known that both oil and water are 
produced during the ordinary recovery of oil from a 
subterranean formation. If the ratio of water to oil, i.e. 
the water-oil ratio or WOR, is low, then the produced water 
can be handled and disposed of in a manner which will not 
unreasonably reduce the economic benefits derived from the  
 
produced oil. In such instances, water control can simply 
involve pumping the water from the well and storing or 
otherwise disposing of it in some acceptable fashion. 
However, if the WOR is so high that the various costs of 
pumping, handling, storing and disposing of the produced 
water exceed the economic benefits of the produced oil, then 
the well is either abandoned or an alternative water control 
technique is employed. One alternative water control method is described 
by McLaughlin in U.S. Patent 3,334,689, wherein an aqueous 
solution of a polymerizable composition containing a 
monoethylenically unsaturated acrylate monomer and a 
crosslinking agent are injected into the formation producing 
the water. The monomer and crosslinking agent are caused to 
form a stable crosslinked gel in the formation to thus 
reduce the water permeability of the formation and thereby 
terminate or at least decrease the rate of flow of water 
from the formation. McLaughlin, in U.S. Patent 3,490,533, discloses 
injecting into a subterranean
