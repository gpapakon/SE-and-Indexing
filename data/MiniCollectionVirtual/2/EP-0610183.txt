<ABSTRACT>
The pattern generator for producing an original (6) on an x-y-theta positioning table (7) incorporates a surface optical modulator (13) to which light from an excimer laser source (2) is directed by a mirror (17) and schlieren lens (15). A virtual source (P') corresp. to the real focus (P) of the incoming light is formed in the plane of a filter (18) of unwanted diffraction orders, between the mirror and a projection lens (16).

electronic elements, or for direct illumination 

of wafers or substrates during the photolithographic 
steps required for their production, or for direct 

illumination of structures including light-sensitive 
layers, comprising a light source (2) and a pattern 

generator (3), wherein 

the pattern generator (3) includes an optical schlieren 
system (14) and an active, matrix-addressable 

surface light modulator (13), 
the surface light modulator (13) has a reflective 
surface (19) whose addressed surface areas (19a, 19b, 

...) reflect incident light as diffracted light and

incident light as undiffracted light, 
the schlieren system (14) comprises a schlieren lens 
(15) arranged on the side of the surface light 

modulator (13), a projection lens (16) facing away 
from the surface light modulator (13), and a mirror 

device (17) which is arranged between these lenses 
(15, 16) and which directs light coming from the 

light source (2) onto the surface (19) of the surface 
light modulator (13), 
the schlieren lens (15) is arranged at a distance 
from the surface light modulator (13) which is short 

relative to the focal length of said lens,

one point P which is spaced apart from the mirror 

device (17) and which is adapted to have associated 
therewith at least one virtual point light source

image plane of the virtual point light source (P′) 

between the schlieren lens (15) and the projection 
lens (16), said filter device (18) having a structural 

design of such a nature 

that it will either filter out the diffracted 
light reflected by the addressed surface areas of 

the surface light modulator (13) and permit the 
undiffracted light, which is reflected by the 

non-addressed surface areas, to pass via the 
projection lens (16) to the model (6), the wafer, 

the substrate, or the structure, 
or that it will filter out the undiffracted 
light, which is reflected by the non-addressed 

surface areas of the surface light modulator 
(13), and permit the diffracted light reflected 

by the addressed surface areas to pass via the 
projection lens (16) to the model (6), the wafer, 

the substrate, or the structure, and
