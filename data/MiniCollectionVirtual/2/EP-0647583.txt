<ABSTRACT>
The sheet material inspection apparatus has a pitch 
detection section (51-54) for detecting pitches between 

sheet materials on a conveying path (2) and a control 
section which effects so that the sheet material is 

inserted from a predetermined position of a groove of a 
rotary body (impeller) (41) by adjusting rotating speed of 

the rotary body or by using auxiliary conveying path even 
if a pitch deviation is produced. 
The sheet material conveying device for conveying sheet 
materials has a conveying unit which includes pairs of 

rollers (22) disposed away a predetermined distance from 
each other, a belt (21) stretched between said pairs of 

rollers and wound on said rollers through only a predetermined 
angle; and a guide member (23) disposed between said 

pairs of rollers so that its upper surface is located more 
downward by a predetermined spacing than a conveying 

surface of the belt. Sheet materials are supported between 
said belt and the guide member and conveyed by driving the 

belt, which enables high-speed and less damage conveying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inspection apparatus
for detecting whether collected sheet materials are
normal or damaged and true or false and for re-accumulating
disposal sheet materials and reuse sheet materials, and
also to a sheet material conveying device suited to this sheet
material inspection apparatus.To start with, a conventional sheet material inspection
apparatus will be explained.The sheet material inspection apparatus is an apparatus
which consecutively takes out collected sheet materials
accumulated and fed in at a minute pitch by a take-out unit
and thereafter checks whether the sheet materials are
normal or damaged and true or false while conveying them
on a belt at a high speed. The sheet material inspection
apparatus then determines whether the individual sheet
materials are to be disposed of or reusable, thereafter
distributes the sheet materials to branched conveying paths
and re-accumulates the disposal sheet materials and the
reuse sheet materials, separately. The sheet materials
accumulated as the disposal sheet materials by this
apparatus are thereafter shredder-processed. A processing
speed of the sheet materials in this inspection apparatus
is on the order of 20-30 sheet materials/sec, and a conveying
velocity is always kept constant at 8 m/s.FIG. 1 illustrates a construction of a sheet material
conveying device employed in a conventional sheet material
inspection apparatus. The transfer of the sheet
materials involves independent driving sources and is
conducted in such a way that the sheet material is grasped
from up and down at two portions in the crosswise direction
by flat belts 62, 63 whose conveying surfaces are closely
fitted to each other. These belts are driven by motors 
connected to drive rollers. Driving the belts at a high
speed normally entails an adoption of motors each having
a capacity on the order of several hundreds Watt.As illustrated in FIG. 1, the rollers are disposed
alternately on both sides of the conveying path to ensure
the close-fitting between the belts. In the case of such
a construction, the up-and-down belts have a trace of
speed-difference, and, hence, a frictional force needs to
be applied on both of the belts. For this purpose, a
resistance of the conveying system is large, and large
force is required for driving the belts. Further, the
belts runs with a trace of oscillations in the crosswise
direction, but, because of the surfaces being contact with
each other, the belts undergo influences of the oscillations
each other. There exists
