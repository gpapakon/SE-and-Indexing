<ABSTRACT>
Peritoneal dialysis systems and methods move liquid using a pump chamber (P1, P2) that is operated in response to pneumatic pressure variations applied by a pump actuator (PA1, PA2). The systems and methods periodically measure air pressures in the actuator (PA1, PA2) and an associated reference air chamber (VS1, VS2) and derive from these a measurement of liquid volume moved through the pump chamber (P1, P2). The systems and methods minimize derivation errors by compensating for temperature differences among the pump chamber (P1, P2); the pump actuator (PA1, PA2); and the reference chamber (VS1, VS2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus
for performing peritoneal dialysis.Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) periodically
infuses sterile aqueous solution into the peritoneal
cavity. This solution is called peritoneal dialysis
solution, or dialysate. Diffusion and osmosis
exchanges take place between the solution and the
bloodstream across the natural body membranes.
These exchanges remove the waste products that the
kidneys normally excrete. The waste products
typically consist of solutes like sodium and
chloride ions, and the other compounds normally
excreted through the kidneys like urea, creatinine,
and water. The diffusion of water across the
peritoneal membrane during dialysis is called
ultrafiltration.Conventional peritoneal dialysis solutions
include dextrose in concentrations sufficient to
generate the necessary osmotic pressure to remove
water from the patient through ultrafiltration.Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis
(CAPD) is a popular form of PD. A patient performs
CAPD manually about four times a day. During CAPD,
the patient drains spent peritoneal dialysis 
solution from his/her peritoneal cavity. The
patient then infuses fresh peritoneal dialysis
solution into his/her peritoneal cavity. This drain
and fill procedure usually takes about 1 hour.Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) is another
popular form of PD. APD uses a machine,
called a cycler, to automatically infuse, dwell, and
drain peritoneal dialysis solution to and from the
patient's peritoneal cavity. APD is particularly
attractive to a PD patient, because it can be
performed at night while the patient is asleep.
This frees the patient from the day-to-day demands
of CAPD during his/her waking and working hours.The APD sequence typically last for several
hours. It often begins with an initial drain cycle
to empty the peritoneal cavity of spent dialysate.
The APD sequence then proceeds through a succession
of fill, dwell, and drain phases that follow one
after the other. Each fill/dwell/drain sequence is
called a cycle.During the fill phase, the cycler transfers
a predetermined volume of fresh, warmed dialysate
into the peritoneal cavity of the patient. The
dialysate remains (or "dwells") within the
peritoneal cavity for a time. This is called the
dwell phase. During the drain phase, the cycler
removes the spent dialysate from the peritoneal
cavity.The number of fill/dwell/drain cycles that
are required during a given APD session depends upon
the total volume of dialysate prescribed for the
patient's APD regime.APD can be and is
