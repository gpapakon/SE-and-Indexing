<ABSTRACT>
In a heating installation having a plurality of streams, in order, on the one hand, to make possible presetting of the opening condition of the valves on the plurality of heaters provided in one stream and, on the other hand, also to ensure that all user points are sufficiently supplied with heating liquid but nevertheless that the thermostatic valves of the individual heaters operate quietly and do not whistle, the invention proposes a stream regulation device for individual supply streams of a heating installation, having a valve housing (2) in which a desired-flow adjuster (8, 11, 12), forming a restrictor (9), is arranged between an inlet (3) and an outlet (4), and which has a valve (7) with a closing piece (21), and having an actuator housing (27) in which a first pressure space (36) is in fluid connection (41, 42) with a region downstream of the restrictor (9), the first pressure space (36) is separated from a second pressure space (37), provided with a first control connection (43), by means of a flow actuator (28), and the second pressure space (37) is separated from a pressure space (38), provided with a second control connection (44), by means of a pressure actuator (29), and a desired-pressure adjuster (54 to 59) being connected to the actuator housing (27).
