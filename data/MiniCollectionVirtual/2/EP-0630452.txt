<ABSTRACT>
An axially movable piston (3) that is axially movable in a bore (1) of an housing (2) is loaded on one side with an adjustable force and on the other side rests against a spring device (9) resting itself against a support (8) with respect to the housing (2). Both end positions of the valve piston (3) are determined by stops (14, 15) that are fixed with relation to the housing (2), so that defined volumetric flows may be obtained at the end positions. In order to set in a defined manner the relation between the intensity of the actuating force and the position of the valve piston (3), the support (8) of the spring device (9) is also adjustable.

<CLAIMS>
A proportional distributing valve, with a valve spool (3) which is 
axially displaceable inside a bore (1) in a casing (2) and has control 

edges (4) co-operating with control openings (A, B, P, T) in the casing, 
and with an electromagnetic actuating unit (5) which is positioned 

laterally on the casing (2) coaxially with the valve spool (3), and acts 
with controllable force on one end of the valve
 spool (3), the other end 
thereof being loaded by a spring device (9) supported relative to the 

casing (2) on a supporting surface (8), the two final positions of the 
valve spool (3) being determined by stop devices (14, 15) which are 

fixed in relation to the casing (2) and co-operate with the valve spool 
(3), 
characterised in that
 for specific establishment of the 
correlation between the size of the actuating force and the position of 

the valve spool (3), the supporting surface (8) of the spring device (9) 
is adjustable, and at the actuation unit side the valve spool (3) has a 

collar region (16) which is located outside the bore (1) in the casing 
(2) and is widened in comparison therewith, the inner shoulder (17) of 

the said collar region forming an inner final stop device (14) on the 
casing (2) and the outer shoulder (18) of the said collar region forming 

an outer final stop device (15) on the actuation unit (5). 
A proportional distributing valve in accordance with claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the collar region (16) of the valve spool (3) is 
arranged in a recess (19) concentric therewith in the casing (2) or the 

actuating unit (5), the depth (t) of the said recess being greater by the 
displacement path of the valve spool (3) than the width of the collar 

between the shoulders (17, 18). 
A proportional distributing valve in accordance with claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 the widened collar region (16) is formed as a 
separate component and is connected, preferably pressed or screwed, 

to the control region of the valve spool (3), the said region being 
formed substantially with a cylindrical outline.  

 
A proportional distributing valve in accordance with one of claims 1 
to 3, 
characterised in that
 the supporting surface (8) for the spring 
device (9) is arranged on the inner side - relative to the valve spool (3) 

- of an adjusting device (20) which can be adjustably screwed in or 
pressed in. 
A proportional distributing valve in accordance with one of claims 1 
to 4, 
characterised in that
 it has at least two controllable drainage 
paths to the tank, each located externally with regard to the control 

or adjustment edges, and the drainage path at the collar end extends 
via connecting openings (23) in the valve spool (3) - which is formed 

to be hollow from the end adjacent the spring device (9) - and is 
connected to the tank connection (T) arranged on the casing at the 

end adjacent the spring device (9).
