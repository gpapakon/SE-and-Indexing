<DESCRIPTION>
 A CUPBOARD CARCASSThis invention relates to cupboard carcasses and is particularly applicable to one piece moulded plastics cupboard carcasses suitable for a "built-in" run of cupboard units. An example of the form of carcass to which the invention relates is described and illustrated in our U.K. Patent Application No. 9204611.9.This invention provides a cupboard carcass comprising a one piece open fronted plastics moulding having integral side, back and bottom walls and external rigid bracing means supporting the lower front corners of the carcass against flexing.Preferably the bracing means extend up the front ends of the side panels towards the upper ends thereof.In one embodiment of the invention each bracing means may comprise a rigid right angled metal corner plate extending around and secured to a respective lower front corner of the carcass.More specifically the carcass may have external horizontally extending integral ribs along the bottom and side walls to which the corner plates are secured.For example the bottom wall of the carcass may have integral ribs extending along the lower corner of the carcass between the side wall and bottom wall and further ribs spaced inwardly of the corners and the corner plates are rigidly secured to said ribs.Preferably the open front of the carcass has an 

encircling outwardly extending integral moulded plastics flange and the vertical limb of the angled corner plate has an integral out-turned flange which is secured to the flange of the carcass.The bracing means may further comprise elongate rigid metal members secured to the portions of the peripheral flange on the side walls of the carcass and said members are secured through the flange to the out-turned flanges on the corner plates to create a rigid structure bracing the side walls of the carcass.According to a further feature of the invention the lower limb of each corner plate may have an up-turned flange at its free end to engage and be secured to an integral rib on the underside of the bottom wall of the carcass.The elongate members extending down the flanges of the side walls of the carcass may have a width sufficient to bridge between the flanges of a pair of adjacent carcasses so that one member secures together and braces the adjacent side walls of a pair of carcasses.In addition a flexible sealing strip may be mounted over the elongate bracing member to provide a seal with a cupboard door mounted on the carcass.In a still further feature of the invention a foot for supporting the carcass off the

CLAIMS
1. A cupboard carcass comprising a one piece open fronted plastics moulding having integral side, back and bottom walls and external rigid bracing means supporting the lower front corners of the carcass against flexing.
2. A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the bracing means extend up the front ends of the side panels towards the upper ends thereof.
3. A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein each bracing means comprises a rigid right angled metal corner plate extending around and secured to a respective lower front corner of the carcass.
4. A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the carcass has external horizontally extending integral ribs along the bottom and side walls to which the corner plates are secured.
5. A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the bottom wall of the carcass has integral ribs extending along the lower corner of the carcass between the side wall and bottom wall and further ribs spaced inwardly of the corners and the corner plates are rigidly secured to said ribs.
6. A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4, wherein the open front of the carcass has an encircling outwardly extending integral moulded plastics flange and the vertical limb of the angled corner plate has an integral out-turned flange which 


is secured to the flange of the carcass.
7. A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the bracing means further comprise elongated rigid metal members secured to the portions of the peripheral flange on the side walls of the carcass and said members are secured through the flange to the out-turned flanges on the corner plates to create a rigid structure bracing the side walls of the carcass.
8. A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of Claims 4 or Claim 7, wherein the lower limb of each corner plate has an up-turned flange at its free end to engage and be secured to an integral rib on the underside of the bottom wall of the carcass.
9. A carcass as claimed in any of Claims 4 to 8, wherein said elongate members extending down the flanges of the side walls of the carcass have a width sufficient to bridge between the flanges of a pair of adjacent carcasses so that one member secures together and braces the adjacent side walls of a pair of carcasses.
10. A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of Claims 4 to 9, wherein a flexible sealing strip is mounted over the elongate bracing member to provide a seal with a cupboard door mounted on the carcass.
11. A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of Claims 3 to 10, wherein a foot for supporting the carcass off the ground is mounted on the horizontal limb of the corner plate extending under the bottom wall of the carcass.
