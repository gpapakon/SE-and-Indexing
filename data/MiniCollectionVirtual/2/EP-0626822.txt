<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical
examination systems, and more particularly
to systems for examining tissue using
ultrasonic energy and ultrasound-specific contrast
agents.Ultrasonic techniques are commonly used in medical
imaging systems to study the anatomy and function of
organs and other tissue structures within the body.
Such systems typically energize a transducer to
transmit short pulses of ultrasound into the body. The
backscattered ultrasonic energy reflected by acoustic
interfaces within the body is converted by the
transducer into an electrical signal. The amplitude of
the signal at various points in time is detected and
this information is utilized to construct a moving
image representing a tomographic slice through parts of
the body. Such systems are also capable of obtaining
information about the direction and velocity of blood
flow within the body utilizing Doppler techniques.
Referring to Figure 1, a curve 8 represents the
frequency spectrum transmitted by the transducer. The
Doppler effect resulting from ultrasound striking
moving red blood cells manifests itself as a shifting
of the entire frequency spectrum upwardly or downwardly
without a significant change in overall spectrum shape,
as illustrated by the curves 9a and 9b of Figure 1.
This shift is detected and, in Doppler color flow
mapping systems, the imaging system causes different
colors and intensities to be superimposed on the moving
image based upon the detected shift so that an indication 
of direction and velocity of blood flow is
obtained. A different type of system known as a
spectral Doppler display system creates a graphical
display of blood flow velocity and direction plotted
against time.More recently, ultrasound contrast agents have
been developed to allow the study of perfusion or
distribution of blood supply within body tissues. Such
contrast agents are commonly made of small microbubbles
or gas filled spheres. Such contrast agents are strong
scatters of ultrasound. Hence, if they are injected or
delivered into the blood supply of an organ or other
tissue, their passage therethrough can be detected by
examining the increase in backscattered ultrasonic
intensity using standard ultrasound imaging equipment
like that described above. Semi-quantitative
assessment of degrees of perfusion may be obtained
using additional equipment that can analyze the
magnitude of increase in backscattered intensity.
Also, various temporal parameters can be measured which
relate to the number of blood cells and
