<ABSTRACT>
Dispersion particles for a fluid having 
magnetic and electrorheological effects simultaneously, 

which comprise conductive ferromagnetic particles whose 
surfaces are coated with an electrically insulating 

layer and a fluid used the same. The present fluid has a 
larger torque induced upon applic
ation of both a 
magnetic field and an electric field than that in a 

fluid having only magnetic or electrorheological effects 
and higher response speed than that in a fluid having 

only magnetic. Furthermore, in the present fluid current 
difficultly passes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dispersion 
particles for a fluid having a characteristic of a 
magnetic fluid susceptible to a magnetic field and a 
characteristic of an electrorheological fluid whose 
viscosity can increase with an applied electric field 
simultaneously and a fluid used the same, and 
particularly to a fluid capable of outputting a large 
force at a high response speed. A magnetic fluid is a colloidal solution, 
which is a uniform dispersion of ferromagnetic particles 
in a solvent, and, when a magnet is provided near the 
magnetic fluid, the entire fluid is attracted towards 
the magnet and behaves as if the entire fluid is 
apparently charged with a magnetism. Furthermore, the magnetic fluid has such a 
characteristic that a large force can be induced in the 
magnetic fluid with an applied magnetic field. By virtue 
of this characteristic, the magnetic fluid is utilized 
for rotating shaft sealing, and further application to  
 
dampers, actuators, gravity separation, ink jet 
printers, etc. can be expected. A typical process for preparing a magnetic 
fluid is a chemical coprecipitation process disclosed in 
JP-A 51-44579, where an aqueous slurry of magnetic 
prepared from an aqueous solution of ferrous sulfate and 
an aqueous solution of ferric sulfate is admixed with a 
surfactant, followed by water washing, drying and 
dispersion into an organic solvent, thereby preparing a 
magnetic fluid. An electrorheological fluid, on the other 
hand, is a suspension of inorganic or polymeric 
particles in an electrically insulating liquid, whose 
viscosity can be rapidly and reversibly changed from a 
liquid state to a plastic state or to a solid state or 
vice versa upon application of an electric field 
thereto. A high response speed is one of the characteristics. As dispersion particles, those whose surfaces 
are readily depolarizable under an electric field are 
usually used. For example, as inorganic dispersion 
particles, silica is disclosed in US Patent No. 
3,047,507, British Patent No. 1,076,754 and JP-A 61-44998, 
and zeolite is disclosed in JP-A 62-95397. As 
polymeric dispersion particles, arginic acid, glucose  
 
having carboxyl groups and glucose having sulfone groups 
are disclosed in JP-A 51-33783; polyacrylic acid cross-linked 
with divinylbenzene is disclosed in JP-A 53-93186; 
and resol-type phenol resin is disclosed in JP-A 
58-179259. As an electrically insulating liquid, mineral 
oil, silicone oil, fluorohydrocarbon-based oil, 
halogenated aromatic oil, etc. are
