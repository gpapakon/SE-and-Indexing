<DESCRIPTION>
 C8-CYCLIC PEPTIDOMIMETICS AS FIBRINOGEN ANTAGONISTSField of the inventionThis invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit platelet aggregation, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and methods of using the compounds for inhibiting platelet aggregation. A method of using the compounds of this invention in combination with fibrinolytic agents is also disclosed.Background of the InventionA thrombus is the result of processes which initiate the coagulation cascade. It is composed of an aggregation of platelets enmeshed in a polymeric network of fibrin. This process is normally initiated as a consequence of tissue injury and has the effect of slowing or preventing blood flow in a vessel. Etiological factors which are not directly related to tissue injury, such as atherosclerotic plaque, inflammation of the blood vessels (phlebitis) and septicemia, may also initiate thrombus formation. In some instances, the inappropriate formation of a thrombus, and subsequent decrease in blood flow, may have pathological consequences, such as stroke, pulmonary embolism and heart disease. 

 Platelets play a major role in thrombus formation. Current antithrombotic therapy employs agents that modify the platelet/endothelial cell arachidonate-prostaglandin system, such as prostacyclin analogues, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, thromboxane synthesis inhibitors and thromboxane receptor antagonists; and anti-coagulants, such as heparin. These agents inhibit one or both of two discernible phases of platelet aggregation. The primary phase, which is a response to chemical stimuli, such as ADP (adenosine diphosphate) , collagen, epinephrine or thrombin, causes initial activation of the platelets. This is followed by a secondary phase, which is initiated by the platelets themselves, and is characterized by thromboxane A2 (T A2) synthesis and the release of additional ADP from platelet storage granules, which further activates platelets.Prostacyclin, also called prostaglandin I2 (PGl ) , and stable PGI2 analogues inhibit both the primary and secondary phases of platelet aggregation. However, use of such analogues has been associated with undesirable changes in blood pressure. See Aiken, et al . , Prostaglandins, 19, 629-43 (1980) .Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and thromboxane synthetase inhibitors act to block the production of TxA2. x 2 antagonists block the effects of TxA2 by binding the T A2 receptor. These therapies act only upon the secondary stage of platelet activation. Use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors has been
