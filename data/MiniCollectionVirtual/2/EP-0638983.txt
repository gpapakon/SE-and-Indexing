<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rotor construction in an 
asynchronous electric machine, the rotor construction 
comprising an electrically conductive conductor construction 
which is located substantially adjacent to 
a stator of the asynchronous electric machine and 
associated with a rotor shaft. Either so-called solid rotors or a solution using a 
so-called rotor core packet coupled to a squirrel-cage 
winding are generally used in electric machines. 
From a constructional point of view, the solid rotor 
consists of a possible set of grooves formed in the 
rotor shaft and a conductive coating material placed 
in association therewith. The purpose of the construction 
has been especially to improve the electrical 
properties of the machine, especially the efficiency 
of the machine. The rotor core packet/squirrel-cage 
winding represents a better electrotechnical solution 
than the construction having a solid rotor. In particular, when 
the rotating speeds need to be increased, the 
rotor core packet/squirrel-cage winding solution will 
become problematic because of the low yield point of 
the electric sheets. The great number of sheets in 
the rotor core packet also lowers the bending-critical 
rotating speed of the rotor. The rotor core 
packet/squirrel-cage solution is a problematic solution 
when the manufacturing technique and also the use, 
especially the balancing, are taken into account. With rotor core packet/squirrel-cage winding 
solution, the drawbacks will be more pronounced at 
high rotating and peripheral speeds of the rotor construction, 
making it necessary to use thin and strong 
sheets. The highest permitted peripheral speed of the 
rotor construction is proportional to the square root  
 
of the yield point of the sheet material. Consequently, 
the yield point should be as high as possible when 
the peripheral speeds are increased. The iron losses 
are in proportion to the first and second power of 
the rotating speed and the second power of the thickness 
of the packet sheets. At high rotating speeds, 
the increasing losses are compensated by making the 
packet sheets thinner. It must be also considered 
that the packet sheets are not always of equal thickness 
owing to the tolerances in the manufacturing 
technique. Furthermore, they must be provided with a 
thin insulating layer on their surfaces for decreasing 
the eddy current losses. The rotor core packet made 
of thin sheets and the squirrel-cage winding must 
almost always be compressed in an axial direction for 
achieving the
