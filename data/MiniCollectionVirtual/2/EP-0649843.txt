<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thiazoline
derivatives, and more particularly to thiazoline
derivatives having fibrinogen receptor antagonism and
cell adhesion factor antagonism.Blood platelets are considered to bind each
other via fibrinogen and aggregate as a result of the
appearance of the binding site of fibrinogen on the
blood platelet membrane glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex
caused by stimulation of various blood platelet
aggregation-inducers. Therefore, the compounds having
the antagonism against fibrinogen receptor are expected
to have the inhibitory action of blood platelet
aggregation. Among the known compounds having the
inhibitory action of blood platelet aggregation are
peptide derivatives such as Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser containing
Arg-Gly-Asp (hereinafter referred to as RGDS) which is
considered to be a binding site of fibrinogen receptor
[Thrombosis Res., vol. 56, No. 6, page 687 (1989)] and
compounds having an amidino group in the molecule
(described in Japanese Patent Kokai 2-223543). However, the above compounds are
insufficiently effective.An object of the present invention is to
provide compounds having excellent fibrinogen receptor
antagonism and cell adhesion factor antagonism, i.e.,
excellent inhibitory agents for blood platelet
aggregation.As a result of various researches, the present
inventors have found thiazoline derivatives having
fibrinogen receptor antagonism and cell adhesion factor
antagonism, and have accomplished the present invention.The present invention is a thiazoline
derivative represented by the formula:

[wherein R1 is a cyano group, a carbamoyl group, a
thiocarbamoyl group, a morpholinothiocarbonyl group, an
alkylthioimidoyl group having 2 to 7 carbon atoms, a
group represented by the formula:
 
(wherein R11 and R12 are the same or different and are
each a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6
carbon atoms, an alkoxycarbonyl group having 2 to 7
carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 4 to 8 carbon
atoms, a phenyl group, a phenyl group substituted by an
alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group
having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a halogen atom, an aralkyl
group being an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms
substituted by a phenyl or a naphthyl group at the end
thereof, or the aralkyl group substituted by an alkyl
group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having
1 to 4 carbon atoms, a trifluoromethyl group or a
