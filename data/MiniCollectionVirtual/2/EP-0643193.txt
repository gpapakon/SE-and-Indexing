<ABSTRACT>
It is based on a cylindrical case with cover (2) and a strip 
steel (4) rolled around a central socket (5) with its free end 

bored (12) and fixed to the socket by means of hooks (6). This 
socket houses, in turn, a clutch socket (1) attached to the 

cover and body of the case while the lower end of the 
strip steel is fixed by means of another bore (11) to a pin (3) 

protruding from the case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a clutch system for lower
collection casing for roller blind tapes which consists
of a case with a cover housing a mechanism encompassing
two single internal components: a serrated socket and a
strip steel, as well as an external clutch socket where
the casing is incorporated.The rolling and fixing systems for blind rollers are well
known in the art, as well as those more recent ones which
incorporate these devices inside the drum on the shaft of
the blind roller or on its lower tape roller.The clutch devices offer different fixing solutions
depending on whether the solution chosen is incorporated
into the drum of the shaft of the blind roller or inside
the lower tape roller case near the lowest level of the
extended blind roller.The technological solution offered by a clutch
incorporated into the drum of the shaft of the blind
roller (for instance,
Spanish Utility Models U9102552 or U9202311)
is
different that the solution proposed herein and needs the
installation of a larger number of components.Another possible solution, within the lower rolling case
of the tape calls for the fixing of the clutch to the 
cover which, in turn, entails the installation of
additional components in both elements.On the other hand, and for cost reasons, strip steels
have become widely used and are fixed to the socket by
means of rivets. This solution is not a practical one
since, normally, the tension of the strip steel tends to
break the rivet which adds to the problems posed by the
insertion of the rivet.Document DE-B-1132690 and Document EP-A-0096137 show the use of spring inside the casing body, spring which is joined by one of its ends to a central socket and by the other end to the inner side of the cylindrical case body.The proposed invention solves the problems previously described by reducing
on the one hand the number of components of the clutch
system to a minimum number and, on the other hand, by
conferring multiple uses to such components.Additionally, the design of one of the components solves
the mechanical problem posed by the tension at the end of
the strip steel since an additional intermediate
operation during the assembly consisting of a 90ยบ turn
makes it impossible to detach the strip steel from its
fixing point.According to the invention there is provided a driving clutch system having the features as defined in claim 1.The clutch operated rolling device for a roller blind
tape essentially comprises a metal cylindrical case body
with a cover and a shaft axially extending

<CLAIMS>
Driving clutch system for operating a roller blind tape
from a lower collection casing, said system comprising a

cylindrical case body (2) with a cover, a shaft (9) axially
extending between the body and the cover, fixed to both and

provided with a common central passing bore, and a steel
strip (4) attached at one end to the internal periphery of

the case body and rollable around the shaft from its other
inner end, characterized in that the inner end of the steel

strip (4) is fixed to a first tubular socket (5) through a
central opening (12) of said inner end fitted between two

axially spaced hooks (6) extending from said first socket
(5) with opposed angles, said first socket (5) additionally

incorporating at each of its ends a triangular-shaped tooth
(7) extending inwardly toward the axis of the socket (5)

and made by cutting and bending inwardly said ends, said
teeth (7) being permanently housed inside recesses of a

second clutch socket (1) placed concentrically inside the
first socket (5) and surrounding concentrically the shaft

(9), said second socket (1) being longer than the first
socket (5) and presenting at both ends two similar

diametrically opposed recesses larger that the thickness of
the teeth so that once the teeth are engaged into the

recesses there is room enough toward each edge of the
second socket (1), to fix two keys (10) attached to a

keyslot of the shaft (9).
Driving clutch system for operating a roller blind tape
from a lower collection casing according to claim 1

characterized in that the outer end of the steel strip (4)
incorporates a central slot (11) where a double headed pin

(3) is attached and fixes one the one hand the steel strip
(4) to the inner side of the cylindrical case body (2),

while on the other hand fixes the roller blind tape to the 
outer side of the cylindrical case body by introducing the pin head into

a slot previously cut in the central part of the lower end
of said roller blind tape.
