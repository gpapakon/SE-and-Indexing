<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid valve (3) is mounted in a control pipe between the pump chamber (12), in which a plunger (11) works, and a low-pressure supply pipe (10), while a high-pressure pipe (6) containing a non-return valve (5) leads from the chamber to one or more injectors. The beginning and end of injection are controlled by shutting and opening the solenoid valve. The end of injection is determined by the clearance (sic) left above the top-dead-centre position of the plunger, this clearance being regulated by the expansion of the clearance (sic) volume between the plunger and non-return valve. This expansion can be dependent on the vacuum in the low-pressure pipe.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the injection of fuel for an internal combustion engine with high 
pressure injection, with a pump action chamber (12) bounded by a pump piston 

(11) and a pump cylinder, with a control line (13) featuring a solenoid valve (3) 
between the pump action chamber and an inlet-side low pressure line (10), and 

with a high pressure line (6) featuring a return valve (5) between the pump 
action chamber and at least one fuel injection nozzle (9), whereby the start and 

the end of fuel injection are triggered by the closing and opening of the solenoid 

valve (3),
characterised in that
 
the end of fuel injection is triggered at a distance (h) after the upper dead centre 

of the pump piston (11) and that the distance (h) is determined by the expansion 
of the damage volume between the return valve (5) and the pump piston (11). 
A process in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the distance (h) is determined by the expansion of the damage volume on the 

suction pressure in the low pressure line.
