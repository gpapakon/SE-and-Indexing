<ABSTRACT>
In a rocket motor nozzle with a selectively reduced outlet cross-sectional area, comprising a convergent part (12) receiving the gases produced in a combustion chamber (13), a nozzle throat (11) of reduced cross-sectional area (So) and a divergent cone (14) connected to the nozzle throat (11) and ending at its downstream part (15) in a gas outlet cross-sectional area (Se) defining a high cross-sectional area ratio ( epsilon  = Se/So), a jettisonable annular obstacle (20) is attached to the downstream end (15) of the cone (14) so as to define, at the outlet of the cone (14) a zone (25) of selectively reduced cross-sectional area (S1) in order, in a first phase of flight, to ensure stability of the separation of the flow of hot gases relative to the wall of the cone (14).

A rocket engine nozzle with a selectively reduced
outlet cross-section for the first stage of a launcher,

the nozzle comprising a converging portion (12) which
receives the gases produced in a combustion chamber

(13), a nozzle throat (11) of reduced cross-section
(So) and a diverging part (14) connected to the nozzle

throat and terminating at its downstream portion (15)
in a gas outlet cross-section (Se) defining a cross-section

ratio (ε = Se/So), the nozzle being
characterized in that a releasable annular obstacle

(20) is connected to the downstream end (15) of the
diverging part (14) so as to define at the outlet of

the diverging part (14) a zone (25) of selectively
reduced cross-section (S1) which ensures stability of

the separation of the flow of hot gases relative to the
wall of the diverging part (14) during a first phase of

flight.
A nozzle according to claim 1, characterized in
that the zone (25) of selectively reduced cross-section

(S1) constitutes about 55% to 85% of the outlet cross-section
(Se) of the diverging part (14).
A nozzle according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the annular obstacle (20) is

constituted by an axially symmetrical ring which is
inclined towards the outside relative to a plane

perpendicular to the axis of the nozzle (10), to form
with that plane an angle lying in the range of about

20° to 45°, the ring having a uniform curvature. 
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the annular obstacle (20) is

constituted by a set of angular sectors (21) assembled
to one another and provided with contact surfaces which

cause them to move in unison.
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the annular obstacle (20) is

provided with thermal protection means (60).
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the annular obstacle (20)

includes means (30) for selectively connecting it to
the downstream end (15) of the diverging part (14) and

in that the rupture of these connecting means (30) is
remotely controlled.
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that it comprises means (30) for

connecting the releasable annular obstacle (20) to the
downstream end (15) of the diverging part, which means

are configured so as to break automatically after a
predetermined operating time.
A nozzle according to claim 4, characterized in
that the angular sectors (21) assembled to one another

each include a hook (24) in the form of a clamp
intended to grip a flange (15a) formed at the

downstream end of the diverging part (14).
A nozzle according to claim 4 or claim 8,
characterized in that the angular sectors (21) are 

assembled to one another by overlapping joints (22,
23).
A nozzle according to any of claims 4, 8 or 9,
characterized in that the inside end (25) of each of

the angular sectors (21) constituting the annular
obstacle (20) is curved back so as to define a groove

(27) in which there is engaged a cable (31) cooperating
with a tensioning and unlocking system (28,

29, 32) to maintain the angular sectors (21) assembled
to each other and connected to the diverging part (14)

during said first phase of flight, and to release the
angular sectors (21) and allow them to be ejected so as

to release the outlet section of the diverging part at
the end of said first phase of flight.
A nozzle according to claim 5, characterized in
that the thermal protection means (60) comprises means

(61) for injecting turbine gas through the wall of the
diverging part (14) downstream of the zone (17) at

which the flow of hot gases separates from the wall of
the diverging part (14).
A nozzle according to claim 5, characterized in
that the thermal protection means (60) comprises means

(62) for circulating cool gas through the wall of the
annular obstacle (20).
A nozzle according to claims 5 and 11,
characterized in that the thermal protection means (60)

comprises means (63) for injecting turbine gas through
the wall of the diverging part (14) in the vicinity

both of the outlet section of the diverging part and of
the zone where the annular obstacle (20) is connected. 
A nozzle according to claim 5, characterized in
that the thermal protection means (60) comprises an

abradable material which forms at least part of the
annular obstacle (20).
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the annular obstacle (20) is

constituted by an abradable material.
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that the cross-section ratio ε of the

nozzle is greater than 45.
A nozzle according to any of claims 1 to 16,
characterized in that the cross-section ratio ε of the

nozzle is not less than 80.
A nozzle according to claim 7, characterized in
that the connecting means which rupture automatically

comprise parts made of abradable composite material.
