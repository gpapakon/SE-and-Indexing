<ABSTRACT>
The support and positioning device for optical filters is 
capable of varying the spacial intensity distribution of 

a laser beam emitted by a laser source and striking a 
surface to be irradiated. 
The device (15) is fastened to the base structure (16) of 
the laser source (10) and comprises several means for 

translating and tilting said device in space, 
relatively to an axis of the laser beam emitted by the 

laser source. The tilting means are constituted by an 
element bearing an optical filter (13) or "mask", 

which can be tilted at any angles relatively to the 
laser beam (11), and can be positioned along each direction 

in space, spaced apart from a surface to be 
irradiated, such as a cornea (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
support/positioning device for optical filters, the 
so-said "masks", used during eye cornea remodeling 
surgery. The technique of use of laser light in order to 
erode a selected surface of various mechanical pieces, 
in particular made of plastics materials, has been 
long known. In view of these features, the use has widely 
spread of laser light also in medical sector, in which 
several biological materials exist which are 
susceptible of being submitted to ablation treatments 
by laser light. These biological materials or tissues 
are represented by cartilages, membranes, ligaments, 
bones, teeth and, in particular, human eye cornea. In fact, the latter has been submitted for long 
time to surgery aiming at modifying the geometrical 
curvature and hence the refractive properties, in 
order to correct the most important refractive defects 
of human eye, such as myopia, hyperopia and 
astigmatism. In various cases, such operations are still being 
carried out according to traditional microsurgical 
techniques, using surgical instruments for cutting, 
removing and suturing biological materials. However, these traditional methods, as already 
said above, have been overcome long ago by laser 
surgery, which secures a full range of advantages, 
which can be found in the extremely high degree of  
 
surgical control of ablation, which may even be of 
less than 1 µm of thickness removed per each laser 
pulse. Another advantage is the fact that the side 
thermal damage due to heat conduction is very low and 
can be observed within the region of from 0.3 to 1 µm. Argon-fluorine laser, ArF, has been found to be 
the optimal source for this type of applications, 
i.e., for surgery interesting human eye cornea. Owing 
their features, these lasers are used in two different 
procedures for cornea remodeling. In the first case, the laser beam is of a size 
which may be either larger than, or the same as, of 
the optical area to be treated; on the contrary, in 
the second case, the beam is smaller than it, and 
therefore it must be electro-optically deflected in 
order to allow it to completely treat said area. As to 
the first method, which secures the homogeneity of the 
ablation, it surely is more widespread, as well as 
faster and simpler, than the second one cited above. 
Unfortunately, it causes several difficulties when 
geometrically asymmetrical or axially depressed 
corrections have to be carried out. This drawback was overcome with the technique 
disclosed in United
