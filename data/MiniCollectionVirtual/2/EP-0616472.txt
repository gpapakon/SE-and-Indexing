<ABSTRACT>
A picture series is encoded so that a first type of 
decoder having only one frame memory and incapable of bidirectional 

decoding can decode an encoded bitstream, and 
a second type of decoder having multiple frame memories and 

capable of bi-directional decoding can decode an encoded 
bitstream to produce a higher quality decoded picture 

series. The encoded bitstream comprises three parallel 
channels (channels 0 to 1) of encoded picture data. The 

first channel (channel 0) includes every other picture and 
header information common to the second and third channels. 

The second channel (channel 1) includes the pictures not 
represented in the first channel and encoded by one of 

forward and backward predictive coding. The third channel 
(channel 3) includes the pictures not represented in the 

first channel and encoded by bi-directional predictive 
coding. The first type of decoder uses the first and 

second channels, while the second type of decoder uses the 
first and third channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transmission and
decoding of picture signals.In, for example, a teleconferencing system or a
video telephone system, moving picture signals are
compressed and encoded by taking advantage of intra-frame
and inter-frame correlation so that they can be
more efficiently transmitted over a communication
channel to a remote location.Intra-frame correlation can be utilized by an
orthogonal transformation, such as a discrete cosine
transformation (DCT).Inter-frame correlation can be utilized by
predictive encoding between successive pictures. As
used herein, a picture generally refers to an image
represented by a frame. When the fields of a frame
are coded in a non-interlaced manner, that is,
separately, each field may be referred to as a
picture.As shown in Fig. 1A, for example, of the attached
drawings, frame pictures PC1, PC2 and PC3 are
generated at time points t1, t2 and t3. As shown by
shading in Fig. 1B, the difference between the frame
pictures PC1 and PC2 is obtained as difference picture
data PC12, and the difference between the frame
pictures PC2 and PC3 is obtained as difference picture
data PC23. Since there is a fairly small change
between signals of temporally neighboring frames,
transmission of only the difference picture data
utilizes the transmission channel more efficiently
than transmission of the original pictures. That is,
using the difference picture data as encoded picture
signals reduces the amount of data to be transmitted. However, if only the difference signals are
transmitted, the original picture cannot be restored.
It is advantageous to occasionally transmit a picture
which is not predictively encoded as a reference for
difference picture data, and because it is sometimes
more efficient than transmitting the picture as a
predictively encoded picture.Pictures which are encoded utilizing only intra-frame
correlation, and not inter-frame correlation,
are referred to herein as intra-pictures or I-pictures.Pictures which are encoded with predictive
encoding relative to one previously encoded picture
are referred to herein as predictive pictures or P-pictures.
The previously encoded picture may be an I-picture
or a P-picture, and may temporally precede the
P-picture.Pictures which are encoded with predictive
encoding relative to at most two pictures, a
temporally preceding and a temporally succeeding
picture, are referred to herein as bi-directionally
predictive coded pictures or B-pictures. The two
pictures may each be an I-picture or a P-picture.
