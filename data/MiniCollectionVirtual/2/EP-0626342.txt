<ABSTRACT>
A process for purification of hydrogen peroxide 
is provided which comprises contacting an aqueous hydrogen 

peroxide solution with a chelate resin. According to 
the process, it is possible to remove impurities in the 

aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in high efficiency, 
and particularly, it is possible to remove iron, aluminum, 

etc., which are difficult to remove singly by ion 
exchange resins, up to extremely low concentrations. 

Highly pure hydrogen peroxide solutions obtained by this 
invention can suitably used for washing of silicon 

wafers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for purification 
of hydrogen peroxide which comprises removing 
impurities existing in a very small quantity in an aqueous 
hydrogen peroxide solution, and particularly to a 
process for preparation of highly pure hydrogen peroxide 
usable for washing silicon wafers, etc. Basic or acidic aqueous hydrogen peroxide 
solutions are widely used for washing silicon wafers. It 
is necessary to use extremely highly pure aqueous hydrogen 
peroxide solutions for this use, and it is usually 
required that the concentration of impurities in the 
aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution is 1 ppb or less. 
When the densities of integrated circuits are high, the 
concentration is sometimes required to be 0.2 ppb or 
less, and sometimes to be 0.1 ppb or less. As a process for purification of hydrogen 
peroxide, treatment with ion exchange resins is known, 
but for some impurities it is difficult to remove them 
completely singly by ion exchange resins. For example, 
it is extremely difficult to remove iron, aluminum, etc. 
up to 0.2 ppb or less. When these impurities are contained 
in washing chemicals, they adhere to silicon 
wafers and have a large influence on electric characteristics 
of semiconductors prepared from the silicon 
wafers, and therefore a purification technique superior 
to the prior techniques is desired. The present inventors previously found a method 
of removing organic impurities from an aqueous solution 
of hydrogen peroxide, which comprises bringing an aqueous 
solution of hydrogen peroxide containing organic impurities  
 
into contact with a halogen-containing porous resin 
having a true specific gravity in the wet state of 1.1 to 
1.3 (US Patent No. 4,792,403). Shiga et al. found that a highly pure aqueous 
hydrogen peroxide solution can be prepared safely and 
inexpensively without lowering the ratio of removal of 
the strong acid anions and with lowering decomposition of 
hydrogen peroxide by an anion exchange resin, by removing, 
the anionic impurities using a bicarbonate salt type 
or carbonate salt type anion exchange resin and with 
continuous or semi-continuous addition of 0.1 to 5 
milliequivalent/liter-aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution 
of an acid or its salt having an acid dissociation index 
pKa of 5 or less in water (Japanese Patent Application 
Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 17105/1993). US-A-5 200 166 discloses the purification of hydrogen peroxide using a chelate resin. However, even by these processes, it was difficult 
to remove iron and aluminum in an
