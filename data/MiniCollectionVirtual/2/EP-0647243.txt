<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of an ethylene/1-butene or ethylene/1-butene/diene elastomer by slurry polymerization of the monomers in a polymerization medium consisting mainly of an excess of the 1-butene maintained in liquid form, performed in the presence of a catalyst based on a metallocene compound of Ti, Zr or Hf. This process is exempt from occurrence of reactor fouling and enables the recovery of the polymer without the use of steam as a stripping agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing an ethylenic copolymer. More particularly, it
relates to a slurry polymerization process for preparing
an elastomeric ethylene-based copolymer.Among the ethylene-based elastomeric copolymers,
only ethylene-propylene (EPM) and ethylene-propylenediene
(EPDM) elastomers are produced on a commercial
scale, at the date of the present invention.The industrial production of EPM and EPDM
elastomers is currently carried out in the presence of
Ziegler-Natta vanadium-based catalysts, by solution or
slurry processes.In the solution processes, the comonomers are
dissolved in a solvent, commonly hexane, in which the
formed polymer is soluble. In the slurry processes, the
reaction medium is essentially formed by an excess of the
liquid propylene which acts as a polymerization diluent,
and the polymer is formed as a solid precipitate
suspended in the liquid phase.A slurry process offers a number of advantages
over a solution process, namely:
no stirring viscosity problems;very homogeneous reaction medium;easier removal of the reaction heat;increased reactor throughput owing to higher
concentration of the polymer in the medium;higher polymerization yields;capability of producing very high MW polymers;energy savings for the recovery of the polymer;lower investment and production costs.However, a major problem of a suspension process
arises from the adhesive properties of the rubbery
material. As a matter of fact, the solid particles of 
the polymer have a tendency to stick to one another or to
the wall surface and to the agitating element of the
reactor. This worsens to a large extent the diffusion of
ethylene in the reaction medium and, what is more, causes
intensive fouling of the reactor, thus rendering the
preparation of the polymer very difficult.In order to avoid such problems, a solvent, such
as toluene or cyclohexane, can be added to the reaction
medium, which acts both as antifouling agent and as
vehicle of the catalyst system - see EP-A-336593 and
468537 and WO-A-90/01503. The use of a low boiling
diluent, such as propane, has also been proposed. As a
result, however, the above indicated advantages of a
slurry process are drastically decreased.Another solution which has been proposed to
render the process in bulk possible, is the addition of
antistatic agents into the polymerization reactor. This
solution, however, is not completely satisfactory and,
moreover, has the drawback of introducing undesired
compounds in the final product.Recently, processes
