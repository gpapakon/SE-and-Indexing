<DESCRIPTION>
 KININOGENASE INHIBITORS FIELD OF INVENTIONThe invention relates to enzyme inhibition and to treatment of disease.BACKGROUND - KININSKinins are natural vasoactive peptides liberated in the body from high molecular weight precursors (kininogens) by the action of selective proteases known as kininogenases.There is evidence for the involvement of kinins in the following pathological states:(a) Conditions associated with vasodilatation and hypotension, e.g. septic, anaphylactic and hypovolaemic shock; carcinoid syndrome and dumping syndrome(b) Conditions involving inflammation, e.g. acute arthritis, pancreatitis, local thermal injury, crush injury and brain oedema(C) Conditions involving bronchoconstriction, especially for example the initial, acute allergic reaction in asthma(d) Allergic inflammation, particularly allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, together generally known as hay fever, and the bronchial inflammation and consequent occlusion found in the non-acute but serious and even fatal inflammatory phase of asthma.The kinins (bradykinin, kallidin and Met-Lys-brε kinin) are potent medic rs of inflammation. Their r .n actions are as follows:(a) They increase capillary permeability which leads to exudate formation and oedema(b) They are potent vasodilators in arterioles and therefore reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow 

 (c) They induce pain(d) They contract bronchial smooth muscle(e) They activate phospholipase A2 and thus stimulate the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PCs) which mediate some of their actions.In regard to prostaglandins, it may be noted that certain actions of kinins, particularly pain and vascular permeability above, are potentiated by PCs, although PCs themselves do not cause pain nor do they induce vascular permeability at the concentrations found in inflamed tissue. PCs therefore act as either mediators or potentiators of kinins.In spite of the above knowledge of kinins and their actions, relatively little attention has been paid to reduction of their action. In asthma treatment for example clinical attention is primarily directed to the acute bronchoconstrictive reaction, for which there are effective drugs. Deaths continue to occur from the gradually developing bronchial occlusion, and at present not only are there no clinically effective inhibitors of kinin release available but the concept of kinin release inhibition, at least in treating allergic inflammation, appears to be new. The only substance that is in fact a kinin release inhibitor and has attained clinical
