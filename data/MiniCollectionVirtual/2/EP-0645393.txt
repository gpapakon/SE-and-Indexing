<ABSTRACT>
Alkylaluminoxanes having improved catalytic activity such as when they 
are used in combination with metallocenes for the polymerization of alpha-olefins, are 

prepared by treating an organic solvent solution of an alkylaluminoxane, such as 
methylaluminoxane, with anhydrous lithium halide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to alkylaluminoxanes and more
specifically to alkylaluminoxanes having both increased solubility in organic solvents
and increased catalytic activity which are prepared by treating alkylaluminoxanes with
anhydrous lithium halide salts.My U.S. patent 5,157,137 relates to a process for forming clear, gel
free solutions of alkylaluminoxanes by treating a solution of the alkylaluminoxane with
an anhydrous salt and/or hydroxide of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. I now have
found that alkylaluminoxanes treated with anhydrous lithium chloride, bromide or fluoride
have both improved organic solvent solubility and improved catalytic activity
when used in olefin polymerization.EP-A-0 526 692 discloses a process for preparation of hydrocarbylaluminoxanes including
reacting a hydrocarbyl aluminum compound with a hydrate of alkali metal halide.
The document relies on reaction of hydrates of alkali metal salts to obtain the alkylaluminum
compound. This is well-known prior art. The document is silent on further treatments
of the thus obtained aluminoxanes to improve their stability and activity.In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for production of an alkylaluminoxane
having improved catalytic activity comprising treating an
organic solvent solution of alkylaluminoxane with anhydrous LiX, where X is selected
from chloride, fluoride, and bromide.Also provided is an olefin polymerization catalyst comprising a
metallocene and an alkylaluminoxane obtained by treating an organic solvent solution
of alkylaluminoxane with anhydrous LiX, wherein X is selected from the group
consisting of chloride, fluoride and bromide.  Hydrocarbylaluminoxanes may exist in the form of linear or cyclic
polymers with the simplest compounds being a tetraalkylaluminoxane such as
tetramethylaluminoxane. (CH3)2AlOAl(CH3)2, or tetraethylaluminoxane,
(C2H5)2AlOAl(C2H5)2. The compounds preferred for use in olefin polymerization
catalysts usually contain about 4 to 20 of the repeating units:

where R is C1-C8 alkyl including mixed alkyl, and especially preferred are compounds
where R is methyl. Methylaluminoxanes (MAOs) normally have lower solubility in
organic solvents than higher alkylaluminoxanes and the methylaluminoxane solutions
tend to be cloudy or gelatinous due to the separation of particles and agglomerates.
This problem is frequently encountered with MAOs which have been prepared by
adding free water, either neat or contained in a solvent, to a solution of
trimethylaluminum as
