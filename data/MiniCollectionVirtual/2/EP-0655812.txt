<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a multi-wire feeding apparatus 
comprising a plurality of wire feeding units (1a, 1b, 1c) 

arranged side by side in parallel. Each unit uses an 
endless belt (3) having projections (10) thereon and a gear 

wheel (7a, 7b, 7c) having projections to engage those of 
the endless belt for driving the endless belt and feeding 

a length of wire thereon. Transmission axles (6a, 6b, 6c) 
for transmitting driving power to associated gear wheels 

are arranged so that these gear wheels do not interfere 
with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-wire feeding
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. Such
apparatus is designed to control the feeding lengths of
wires from the wire rolls, thereby providing a plurality of
wires of different desired lengths. Such multi-wire feeding
apparatus may be used to provide electric connector
harnesses each having parallel arrangement of different wire
lengths fixed to electric connectors at their opposite ends.An apparatus referred-to above is known from US-A-4,879,934
and has endless belts with parallel runs which
define the paths of movement of the wires. The belts are
toothed on its inner periphery and smooth on its outer
periphery.Fig. 26 shows a conventional multi-wire measuring
apparatus using a roll-feeder mechanism. It comprises a
single feeding roll 1', a numerical control drive motor 2'
to rotate the single feeding roll 1' and pressure rolls 3',
4', 5' ... equal to as many wires as are to be fed and
measured W1, W2, W3 .... In operation, a plurality of wires
are pinched between the single feeding roll 1' and their
respective pressure rolls 3', 4', 5'. A length of wire W1 is
fed over a distance L1 measured from the reference position
N to an exact wire length L1 by rotating the motor 2' for
tl; a length of wire W2 is fed over a distance L2 measured
from the reference position N to an exact wire length L2 by
rotating the motor 2' for t2; and a length of wire W3 is fed
over a distance L3 measured from the reference position N to
an exact wire length L3 by rotating the motor 2' for t3. The
wire-feeding distance is determined from the rotation angle
or number per unit time. After permitting the wire W1 to run 
a predetermined distance L1 the associated pinch roll 3' is
released, and at the same time the motor 2' is made to stop.
It takes a short time Δt1 for the motor 2' to stop. Then,
the motor 2' starts to rotate for t2, thereby permitting the
wire W2 to run a total length L2 measured from the reference
position N. Then, the associated pinch roll 4' is released,
and at the same time, the motor 2' is made to stop. It takes
a short time Δt2 for the motor 2' to stop. Then the motor 2'
starts to rotate for t3, thereby permitting the wire W3 to
run a total length L3 measured from the reference position
N. Thus, a wire length L3 is measured. This is repeated
until the longest wire length is measured. In this
particular example it takes t1 + Δt1 + t2 + Δt2 + t3 + Δt3
to determine the wire length W3. This prior art is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application
