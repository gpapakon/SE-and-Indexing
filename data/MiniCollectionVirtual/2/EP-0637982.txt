<ABSTRACT>
A method for transferring components and heat between a liquid stream and a counter-flowing vapour stream in a series of steps defined by a series of stages (P1, P2, P3) along a common axis. The method is characterized in that both streams flow co-currently and transversely to said axis with each stage, said liquid stream (7, 8, 9) being fed into one end of the stage in a narrow portion (12, 13) thereof when it is mixed with and drawn upwards by the vapour stream, whereafter it is separated from the horizontally flowing vapour stream in a wider stage portion (14), said streams being recovered at the opposite end of the stage after the transfer has occurred. The feed-in and separation portions being reversed from one stage to the next so that the liquid and vapour streams entering and exiting from the ends of each stage are in direct communication with the previous stage and the next stage in the respective opposite flow directions of the liquid and vapour streams between each stage. An apparatus for carrying out the method consists of separation stages arranged side-by-side and made of modular elements having a feed-in portion and a separation portion.

Process for the transfer of components with heat transfer between at least one
liquid stream and at least one vapour stream circulating in opposite directions by

successive steps in a series of n stages sharing a common axis, the liquid stream and
the vapour stream progressions being on opposite directions,

characterised by the fact that:

The common axis is nearly horizontal,
In each stage of level n, the liquid stream and the vapour stream move concurrently
and transversally to the common axis from at least one entrainment zone in which the

liquid is introduced through an orifice (8,16,29) from the stage of level n+1 by
aspiration, then entrained upwards by the vapour coming from the stage of level n-1,

the liquid stream and the vapour stream being then separated by gravity when
travelling nearly horizontally in at least one intermediate zone before flowing

separately in at least one collect zone, the entrainment and collect zones being
alternated from one stage to the other in such a way that the liquid and the vapour

separated in one stage of level n feed directly into the liquid and vapour entrainment
zone of stages level n-1 and n+1 respectively.
Device for the carrying out of the procedure detailed in claim 1, characterised by
the following when on stream:


A number of separation stages with a common axis arranged side by side horizontally
and separated by common, nearly vertical walls, each stage includes at least a

modular chamber in which the liquid stream and the vapour stream move
concurrently and transversally to the common axis from an entrainment zone in which

the vapour stream coming from a first orifice (10,30) located at the bottom part of one
side extremity of the modular chamber aspires through a siphon (9, 34) and moves

upwards with the liquid coming through a second adjacent orifice (7, 29) up to a
collect zone in which the liquid stream and the vapour stream are separated and flow

off through the third (15, 32) and fourth adjacent orifice (18, 31) respectively, located
at the bottom part of the other side extremity of the modular chamber and separated

by a barrier, the entrainment and collect zones being separated by an intermediate
zone in which the liquid and the vapour are separated by gravity, position of the

orifices being alternated from one modular chamber to the corresponding modular
chamber of the adjacent stage in order that the said first (10, 30) and fourth (18, 31)

orifices, respectively second (7, 29) and third (15, 32) orifices being regrouped in a
common one (11, 19), respectively (8, 16) done though the common wall separating

the said modular chamber to the modular chamber corresponding to the adjacent
stage.
The device pertaining to claim 2 in which each stage has a number of
juxtapositioned modular chambers positioned laterally in such a way that the

entrainment, respectively collect zone of two modular chambers being jointed at the
level of the junction of the two modular chambers.
The device pertaining to claim 2 in which each chamber has a triangular ceiling
and a triangular floor, the entrainment zone of the liquid by the vapour should be

situated in the narrow point of the triangular chamber and the separation zone should
be situated in the wider base of the triangular chamber.
The device pertaining to claim 2 in which the stages have walls (2, 3) foreseen for
heat exchange with an outside source and a ceiling foreseen for the cooling by an

outside source.
The device pertaining to claim 2 in which the common axis of the chambers is
inclined from 0.5 to 10 degrees horizontally.
