<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
hydrogen-occlusion-alloy electrode for use as a negative
electrode of an alkaline storage battery such as a nickel-hydrogen
storage battery, and more particularly, to a
hydrogen-occlusion-alloy electrode capable of restraining
the internal pressure of a battery from rising when the
battery is overcharged, thereby prolonging a cycle life of
the battery.A nickel-hydrogen storage battery is recently
attracting attention as a high-capacity battery. The
nickel-hydrogen storage battery has a negative electrode,
which is a hydrogen-occlusion-alloy electrode comprising a
hydrogen-occlusion-alloy supported on a current collector,
and a positive electrode comprising a nickel hydroxide as a
positive electrode active material supported on a current
collector, and uses an alkaline solution as the
electrolyte.One of conventionally known hydrogen-occlusion-alloy
electrodes for use in this type of storage battery is
produced by mixing powder of a hydrogen-occlusion-alloy,
which is capable of reversible occlusion and release of
hydrogen, with powder of a binding agent, such as
polytetrafluoroethylene powder, polyethylene powder or
polypropylene powder, and then molding the mixture into a
sheet. Another hydrogen-occlusion-alloy electrode known in
the art is produced by applying or filling a hydrogen-occlusion-alloy
to or in a current collector, which is an
electrically conductive meshed sheet or perforated metal
sheet having a desired rate of hole area, so that the 
current collector carries the hydrogen-occlusion-alloy
thereon.Of these two electrodes, the latter electrode is
generally produced as described below.First, a slurry containing hydrogen-occlusion-alloy
powder is prepared in the following manner: A
predetermined amount of hydrogen-occlusion-alloy powder
having a predetermined particle diameter is dispersed in an
aqueous solution of thickener, which is prepared by
dissolving a predetermined amount of one or more thickeners
such as methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose,
polyethylene oxide and polyvinyl alcohol in ion-exchange
water or distilled water. At this time, in order to
increase the binding force between the particles of the
hydrogen-occlusion-alloy powder to be supported on the
current collector and thereby prevent the alloy powder from
peeling off the collector, a suitable amount of binder
powder, such as polytetrafluoroethylene powder,
polyethylene powder, polypropylene powder and
polyvinylidene fluoride powder, is added to the solution.
Further, a suitable amount
