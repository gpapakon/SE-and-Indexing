<ABSTRACT>
A laser diode suitable for blue-green light emission 
utilizing type II heterojuctions of II-VI compound semiconductors. 

The laser diode comprises a layer 24 for confining electrons, a 
layer 26 for confining holes, and a quantum well layer which is 

formed bewteen the electron confinement layer 24 and the hole 
confinement layer 26 and allows the confined electrons and holes 

to recombine therein. The laser also comprises an electron 
barrier layer 23 and a hole barrier layer 27 for preventing 

diffusion of the electrons and holes beyond the barriers. The 
light emitted by the recombination is confined between the n 

-cladding layer 22 and a p-cladding layer 28.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a laser diode having type II 
heterojunctions, and more particularly to a II-VI compound laser 
diode suitable for emission of bule-green light. It has been known that II-VI semiconductors have wide band 
gaps and are suitable for fabrication of blue-green laser diodes. 
In fact a successful emission was demonstrated at 77K. See 
Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 59, (1991)1272. A light emitting 
element utilizing II -VI semiconductor is also disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Early Publications 2-125477 and 2-196485 (JP-A-2 125 477; JP-A-2 196 485). However, laser diode having a double-heterojunction 
structure of II-VI compounds lattice matched with a semiconductor 
substrate can not effectively confine both electrons and holes 
simultaneously. In order to confine both electrons and holes, 
laser diodes must be fabricated from a combination of different 
materials having different lattice constants. However, the 
laser will suffer from numerous dislocation caused by misfit of 
different lattice constants of two different materials, which 
prevent continuous wave (cw) operation of blue-green light at 
room temperature. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a blue 
-green laser diode capable of cw operation at a room temperature.  
 It is another object of the invention to provide a II-VI blue 
-green laser diode capable of cw operation at a room temperature. In one aspect of the invention, as defined in Claim 1, there is provided a laser, 
diode comprising a semiconductor substrate and epitaxial layers 
lattice-matched with said substrate in the sequence of: 
a p-cladding layer; a hole barrier layer with p-type conduction forming an 
interface with said p-cladding layer; a hole confinement layer forming an interface with said hole 
barrier layer, for confining therein holes; an electron confinement layer forming an interface with said 
hole confinment layer, for confining therein electrons; an electron barrier layer with n-type conduction forming an 
interface with said electron confinement layer; and an n-cladding layer forming an interface with said electron 
barrier layer, said electron confinement layer and said hole confinement 
layer forming a type II heterojuction, said sequence of semiconductor layers having a band line-up such that 
potential for holes (hole potential) is lower in said hole 
confinement layer them in said electron confinement layer and potential for electrons (electron potential) 
is lower in said electron confinement layer them in said hole
