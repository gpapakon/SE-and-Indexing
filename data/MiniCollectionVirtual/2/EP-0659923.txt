<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a network of parallel glass yarns intended to serve as a reinforcement for an organic substance and to the composite material resulting from this. This network consists of a multiplicity of continuous glass yarns arranged in parallel in the form of a plane web, the said yarns being connected to one another by means of yarns arranged transversely to the said web by a binding method known as chain stitch, the glass yarns being partially fixed to one another by means of a thermoplastic organic binder, and the binding yarns having a modulus of elasticity lower than that of the glass yarns and a melting or softening temperature higher than the melting or softening temperature of the binder. The invention is used for producing articles subjected to mechanical forces.

Network of parallel threads to be
associated with an organic compound to produce a

composite material, the network being formed by a
multiplicity of continuous glass threads, arranged

in parallel in the form of a flat sheet, the
threads being connected to one another by threads

arranged transversely to the sheet in accordance
with a method of binding known as chain stitching,

the glass threads being partially bonded by means
of a thermoplastic, organic binder, and the

binding threads having a modulus of elasticity
lower than that of the glass threads and a melting

or softening temperature greater than the melting
or softening temperature of the binder.
Network according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the melting temperature of
the binder is approximately between 40 and 130Â°C.
Network according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,

characterised in that the binding threads are
regularly spaced at intervals of, approximately,

at least 5 millimetres.
Network according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the glass 

threads are distributed in the sheet in the form
of a series of roves, each rove having a yarn

count of at least 300 tex.
Network according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the glass

filaments are constituted by filaments whose
average diameter is at least 10 micrometres.
Composite material formed by a
thermosetting or thermoplastic, organic compound

reinforced by glass threads, characterised in that
it comprises at least one layer of a network of

glass threads as defined by any one of Claims 1 to
5.
Composite material according to Claim 6,
characterised in that the layer(s) of threads

which reinforce the material are each constituted
by a network in which the sheet of glass threads

is deformed relative to at least one binding
thread, such that the threads are distributed in

at least two groups of parallel threads forming a
specific angle relative to one another.
Composite material according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the sheet is deformed whilst

remaining in a plane, each thread or rove forming 
the sheet having been rotated about each axis

perpendicular to the sheet and passing through the
region of contact between the thread or the rove

and the binding thread selected as the axis of
deformation.
Composite material according to any one
of Claims 6 to 8, characterised in that it

comprises at least two layers of a network formed
by a sheet of glass threads joined to one another

by polyester chain stitching, the layers
reinforcing a compound based on an epoxy resin.
