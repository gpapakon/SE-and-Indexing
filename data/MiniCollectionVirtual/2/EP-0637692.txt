<ABSTRACT>
A displacement controlled hydraulic 
proportional valve (10) is provided with a dashpot 

(44) disposed between a main valve spool (16) and a 
pilot valve spool (22) to stabilize the proportional 

valve (10). The dashpot (44) includes a bore (46) in 
a spring retainer (41) engaging the main valve spool 

(16) and a plunger (47) axially extending from a 
spring retainer (38) engaging the pilot valve spool 

(22) with the plunger extending into the bore (46) to 
define a dashpot chamber (48). The plunger is sized 

to permit restricted fluid flow thereby when the 
spools move relative to each other thereby dampening 

relative movement between the valve spools. Dampening 
the relative movement between the valve spools 

drastically reduces the amount of overshoot by the 
main valve spool.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a servo type 
hydraulic control valve for use in hydraulic systems 
and more particularly to a displacement controlled 
hydraulic proportional valve having a force feedback 
spring positioned between a main valve spool and a 
pilot valve spool. Some of the displacement controlled 
hydraulic proportional valves have a main control 
valve for controlling the main fluid flow between a 
supply pump and a hydraulic motor and a pilot valve 
for controlling the actuation of the main control 
valve. The pilot valve is typically controlled by a 
proportional solenoid exerting a control force on a 
pilot valve spool to move the pilot valve spool toward 
a main control valve spool. Moving the pilot valve 
spool toward the main control spool controls fluid 
pressure in a control chamber such that the main spool 
moves toward the pilot valve spool. The displacement 
of the main control spool is mechanically fed back to 
the pilot valve spool through a force feedback spring 
so that displacement of the main spool is proportional 
to the control force exerted on the pilot valve spool 
by the solenoid. One of the problems encountered with such 
displacement controlled hydraulic proportional control 
valves is that the main spool has a tendency to 
oscillate or become unstable under some operating 
conditions. One of the factors contributing to the 
instability is the fact that displacement of the main  
 
control valve spool is dependant upon the control 
force and feedback force on the pilot valve spool 
reaching equilibrium. Thus, if the acceleration 
forces on the main spool are too high, the main spool 
tends to overshoot the desired position such that the 
feedback forces acting on the pilot valve causes the 
pilot valve spool to oscillate which, in turn, causes 
the main spool to oscillate. The same pilot valve is 
frequently used with several sizes of main control 
valves and the instability is more pronounced on the 
control valves having smaller diameter main valve 
spools. The force feedback spring is normally a coil 
compression spring and another problem encountered is 
that the spring tends to buckle under compression. 
This imposes a side load or torque on the pilot valve 
spool causing increased friction between the spool and 
the bore. The increased friction may result in 
hunting movements of the pilot and main spool. It would, thus, be advantageous to have a 
displacement controlled hydraulic proportional control 
valve design which is stable regardless of the size of 
the
