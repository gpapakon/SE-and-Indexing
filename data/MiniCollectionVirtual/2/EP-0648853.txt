<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a steel material for non-heat-treated steel parts having a high strength in a state formed 
by hot working. A high-strength non-heat-treated steel for hot forging, which contains carbon, silicon, manganese, 

chromium, sulfur, vanadium and nitrogen and at least one of aluminum and titanium each in a specified quantity and 
has a carbon equivalent and a bainitic transformation start point each in a given range; and another high-strength non-heat-treated 

steel for hot forging, which contains carbon, silicon, manganese, chromium, sulfur, vanadium, nitrogen 
and calcium and at least one of aluminum and titanium each in a specified quantity and has a carbon equivalent and 

a bainitic transformation start point each in a given range. This steel material has a tensile strength of 900 MPa or 
above in a hot-forged and non-heat-treated state and enables size and weight reduction of automotive parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
Among steel materials which are worked to produce
machine parts such as automobile parts and industrial machine
parts, the present invention relates to a microalloyed steel
for hot forging from which machine parts are prepared by
working, for example, hot forging or hot rolling (as-hot
worked in some cases), and subsequently by aging in some
cases, a process for producing a microalloyed hot forging
using said steel, and a microalloyed hot forging.Many automobile parts and industrial machine parts are
prepared by hot working a steel bar, and quenching and
tempering the worked products to refine the structure and
enhance the strength and toughness, and the parts thus
obtained are used. However, machine parts which are prepared
without quenching and tempering treatment to reduce the cost,
namely parts prepared from microalloyed steel for hot forging
(referred to as a microalloyed steel hereinafter) have become
increasing common in recent years. Reduced fuel consumption
of automobiles has been required in recent years, to protect
the global environment. One effective method for reducing
fuel consumption is decreasing the weight of vehicles.
Accordingly, improving the strength of automobile parts and
thus making the parts small and light are important goals.To particularly strengthen steel parts, the steel parts
must have a bainite or martensite structure. Various kinds
of inventions have been disclosed relating to microalloyed
steels of bainite structures. Japanese Patent Kokai
Publication No. 1-177339 discloses a microalloyed steel which
can be used in an as-air cooled state after hot forging.
A steel which is also usable in its hot forged condition and has a composition
differing from that of the invention in the Si content of only 0.1-1.0% (in the Example
No. 2 nearest to the invention the Si content amounting to 0,277%) is disclosed
in JP-A-63 57742.
Since bainitic steel has a disadvantage that it has a low
yield strength, the steel has been conventionally toughened 
by further aging. For example, Japanese Patent Kokai
Publication No. 2-25516 discloses a method comprising aging a
bainitic steel at a temperature of 200 to 600Â°C after forging
to toughen the steel.However, demand for automobiles of low fuel consumption
has become increasingly strong, and further strengthened and
toughened parts therefor are required.As a result of investigating the improvement of the
tensile strength of conventional steel parts used as driving-related
parts of automobiles, the present inventors have
discovered that a
