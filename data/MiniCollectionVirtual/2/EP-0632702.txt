<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an upholstered-element construction with a base (1) which acts as the load-bearing part of the construction and a sprung section (2) made up of individual spring elements (4, 4a, 4b) of elastic material which are independent of each other and can compress without affecting each other.

Upholstery element in the form of a mattress or
cushion having a base part (1), a springing part (2)

constituted by individual spring bodies made of a
flexible material such as foam, and a cover (3), and

where the base part (1) extends the entire length and
breadth of the upholstery element,
characterised in that
a) the individual spring bodies (4, 4a, 4b) take
the form of cylindrical solids, have a density

of more than 50 kg/m
3
 and a compressive strength
of less than 5.0 kPa, and are arranged

independently of one another and without
affecting one another as they deflect under

load,
b) the wall height of the base part (1) is 30 to
70 % of the overall height of the upholstery

element proper, and
c) the base part (1) is box-shaped.
Upholstery element according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 a layer of upholstery material
(5) is incorporated between the upper face of the

springing part (2) and the lower face of the cover
(3).
Upholstery element according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 each individual spring body
(4a) is built up vertically from a plurality of

layers with varying elasticity.
Upholstery element according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the spring
bodies (4) of the springing part (2) are arranged on

their own flexible base layer (8). 
Upholstery element according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
individual spring bodies (4) are attached to their

underlayer in an interchangeable manner.
Upholstery element according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that spring bodies

exhibiting varying resilience characteristics are
arranged on one upholstery element.
