<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds useful as cell potassium 
channel openers in mammals such as man. More specifically, the 
invention relates to certain substituted alcohols which are useful in 
the treatment of urinary incontinence in mammals. Because compounds 
according to the invention function to open cell potassium channels, 
they may also be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of 
conditions or diseases in which the action of a therapeutic agent 
which opens potassium channels is desired or is known to provide 
amelioration. Such conditions or diseases include hypertension, 
asthma, peripheral vascular disease, right heart failure, congestive 
heart failure, angina, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, renal cholic, glaucoma, disorders associated with kidney 
stones, irritable bowel syndrome, male pattern baldness, premature 
labor, impotence, and peptic ulcers. Treatment using a compound of the invention can be remedial 
or therapeutic as by administering a compound following the onset or 
development of urinary incontinence in a patient. Treatment can also 
be prophylactic or prospective by administering a compound in 
anticipation that urinary incontinence may develop, for example in a 
patient who has suffered from incontinence in the past. It is known that bladder tissue is excitable and that 
urinary incontinence can be caused by uncontrolled or unstable bladder 
contractions. It is further known that by functioning to open 
potassium channels, potassium channel opening compounds can thereby 
function to relax smooth muscle. While not wishing to be bound by 
theory, it is accordingly believed that the compounds of this 
invention function by opening potassium channels in bladder cells and 
thereby relax or stabilize bladder smooth muscle tissue, thus 
preventing or ameliorating uncontrolled bladder contractions which can 
cause urinary incontinence. European patent applications publication numbers 0181568 and 
0189142 disclose large groups of compounds which are said to be 
lipoxygenase inhibitors and to possess anti-inflammatory and 
anti-allergic properties. These specifications make no suggestion of  
 
compounds having any activity as potassium channel openers. This invention provides a tertiary carbinol having formula I 
(formula set out, together with other formulae referred to in the 
specification by Roman numerals, on pages following the Examples), 
wherein: 
X is selected from 
(a) phenyl which may bear 0-2 substituents selected from 
fluoro, chloro, and
