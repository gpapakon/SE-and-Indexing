<ABSTRACT>
The novel process for the preparation of 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid and salts thereof by oxidising 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulphonic acid with an oxidant in the presence of strong bases is characterised in that the oxidation is carried out in a mixture of water and an organic solvent selected from the series consisting of the alcohols, ethers, esters, acetals and mixtures of these.

Process for preparing 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic
acid and salts thereof of the formula



in which

M
represents hydrogen or an alkali metal ion,

by treating 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulphonic acid with
oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas at a temperature

of from 20 to 80Â°C

in the presence of strong bases, characterized in
that the oxidation is carried out in a mixture of

water and an organic solvent, where the organic
solvent used is at least one solvent selected from

the group consisting of a) the straight-chain or
branched alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms

and 1 or 2 OH groups and/or b) the dialkyl ethers
each having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the

straight-chain or branched alkyl part, which are
optionally substituted by one or more OH or NH
2

groups, the cyclic ethers having from 3 to 5 carbon 
atoms which can be saturated or olefinically

unsaturated, or the polyethers of the formula


in which

R, R

-C
4
-alkyl,
a
represents a number from 0 to 2, and
n
represents a number from 1 to 8,

or polyethers from the group consisting of ethylene
glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl

ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether or mixtures
thereof or mixtures of these polyethers with

methanol or 1,2-ethanediol, and in that the
proportion of water in the solvent is from 15 to
 90%
by weight, based on the mixture.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the oxidant used is air.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the solvent mixture comprising water and

organic solvents contains at least one C

Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the organic solvents used are selected from the

group consisting of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether,
diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol

dimethyl ether or mixtures thereof. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the organic solvent used is ethylene glycol

dimethyl ether and/or diethylene glycol dimethyl
ether and/or triethylene glycol dimethyl ether in a

mixture with methanol and/or 1,2-ethanediol.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the strong bases used are one or more

representatives selected from the group consisting
of the hydroxides, alkoxides and amides of alkali

and alkaline earth metals and alkoxides and amides

preferably 2-5 base equivalents, per mole of 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulphonic
acid.
Process according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that it is carried out in the presence of a catalyst

selected from the group consisting of transition
metal compounds, in particular compounds of Co, Mn,

Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, V, Nb, Ta, Ru.
