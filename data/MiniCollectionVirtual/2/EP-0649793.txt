<ABSTRACT>
Full-aperture easy-open metal can-end for a can of 
the lift-up type with a tab, having an endless score-line 

(3) close to its outer circumference of the can-end, 
wherein the removable part is profiled with a 

plurality of terraces (5, 6, 7) at different heights, 
including an outer terrace (5) close to the outer 

circumference of the can-end, an innermost terrace (7) 
and at least one intermediate terrace (6). Adjacent 

terraces merge into one another with a height 
transition. To achieve low tear-force and/or other 

advantages, the intermediate terrace (6) is inclined in 
a direction opposite to that of the outwardly adjoining 

transition at an angle α in the range 3 to 20 degrees to 
a plane perpendicular to the can axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metal full-aperture 
easy-open metal can-end, intended for a can of the lift-up 
type which is opened by lifting and pulling of a tab 
attached to the can-end, the can-end having an endless 
score-line close to its outer circumference. The 
removable region within the score-line of the can-end is 
profiled with a shape in order to control the opening 
forces. A can-end of this type with a profiled shape 
comprising flat terraces and short transitions between 
terraces is known, and is made from steel or aluminium. 
The forces needed for opening form an important property 
of such a can-end. The can with a can-end of the type in question is 
opened in stages. First the lift-up action of the tab 
makes a crack locally in the score-line. The force 
needed for this is called the pop-force. Next the can-end 
is further cracked open with the tab. The maximum 
force needed for this is called the tear-force. Finally 
the can-end is pulled away from the can. The force 
needed for this is called the tear-off force. In the 
case of an aluminium can-end the pop-force is as a rule 
20 N and the tear-force 40 N. Up to now such a can-end when made from steel has  
 
had the inconvenience that the forces needed for opening 
the can are usually greater than with an aluminium can-end, 
and at best, in the case of the known EOLE can-end 
(Easy Opening Little Effort), these forces are equal to 
the above-mentioned opening forces of an aluminium can-end. 
However, a wholly steel can is very attractive 
from the environmental standpoint. In relation to the present invention, attention is 
drawn to US-A-3 941 277 which in Figs. 12 and 13 shows a 
can-end in which the removable portion has a profiled 
shape with three flat terraces at different height 
positions and, between the outermost flat terrace and 
the next terrace, a deep and wide groove and a slight 
ridge. The inner face of this groove may be regarded as 
a steeply sloping additional terrace. The preamble of claim 1 
is based on this prior art. An object of the invention is to provide a can-end, 
especially a steel can-end, with opening forces which 
are low, especially are lower than, or not greater than, 
the above-mentioned forces for opening an aluminium can-end. This object is attained by the can-end according to claim 1. A further object of the present invention at least 
in some embodiments, is to provide a can end with which 
the maximum tear force occurs with a relatively small 
tab displacement. In accordance with the invention
