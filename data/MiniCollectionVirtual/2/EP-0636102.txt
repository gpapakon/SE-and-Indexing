<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a yarn
tensioning apparatus (see US-A-3 100 091). In one aspect, the present invention
relates to a solenoid useful in yarn or filament tensioning
devices. In a second aspect, the present invention relates to
a yarn or filament tensioning device employing such a
solenoid. In a third aspect, the present invention relates to
an apparatus comprising a plurality of yarn tensioning devices
and to systems for controlling the plurality of devices.A typical yarn tensioning device for tensioning a running
length of yarn includes a pair of adjacent confronting yarn
engaging members which are forced into engagement with the
yarn by means of a solenoid. Generally in textile processing,
a large number of such yarn tensioning devices are used
together to process many strands of yarn simultaneously.There is widespread dependence of overall quality in most
textile processing on the precision or uniformity of tension
of the individual yarn ends. Once yarn tension control is
lost or allowed to vary at any point of the process, whether
winding, beaming, texturizing, knitting or other fabric
formations, it is difficult or impossible to compensate for
the quality degeneration. Streaking, barre, off yield, 
excessive knitting defects, denier variation are familiar
problems that frequently have their origin in incorrect or
uncontrolled tension on the individual yarn strands.In order to control the tension on the yarn, it is
necessary to have control over the solenoid causing tension to
be exerted on the yarn. However, most solenoids are designed
to generate the maximum force possible at the end of their
stroke. Because the force exerted by the solenoid increases
rapidly at the end of its stroke, it is difficult to control
the force exerted by the solenoid and the tension applied to
the yarn.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
solenoid in which the force exerted by the plunger of the
solenoid is linear with respect to the electric power supplied
to the solenoid when the plunger is at a predetermined,
arrested position in the solenoid.It is another object of the present invention to provide
a filament tensioning device in which the filament tension is
easily controlled.It is another object of the present invention to provide
tensioning apparatus in which the tension exerted on each
filament or yarn can be individually controlled for each
solenoid in the apparatus, even when the solenoids are powered
by a common power source. It is another object of the present
