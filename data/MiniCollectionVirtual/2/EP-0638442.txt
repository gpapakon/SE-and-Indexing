<ABSTRACT>
A felt-tipped pen (1) has, in its upper end surface, an insert (6) made from resilient material. By means of an injection needle (10) of a refilling device(7), this insert (6) can be perforated and ink can then be introduced from a chamber (9) of the refilling device (7) into the felt-tipped pen (1) by compression of a hollow body (8).

<CLAIMS>
Felt-tip pen (1) with a separate refilling device (12), 
having a housing (2) in which a tampon (5) of absorbent material 

is arranged for storage of its ink and which has a region (6) for 
the insertion of an injection needle (10) and in which the 

refilling device (12) has an ink-filled chamber (9) connected to 
the injection needle (10), characterized in that the region (6) 

is designed to be perforated by the injection needle (10) and the 
refilling bottle (12) has a cover (11) on which an elastic ball 

is arranged externally as a chamber (9) and the injection 
needle (10) is arranged internally, and in that the injection 

needle (10) projects into the refilling bottle (12) when the 
cover (11) is applied. 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the volume of the chamber (9) corresponds 

to the maximum quantity of ink to be held by the tampon (5) owing 
to its absorbency. 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that the region (5) to be pierced by the 

injection needle (10) is formed by an elastic insert (6) in the 
housing (2) of the felt-tip pen (1). 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the region (6) is provided in the upper end 

face of the housing (2). 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to Claim 3 
or 4, characterized in that the region (6) has a prefabricated 

orifice closed by the elasticity of its material. 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to at least 
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

injection needle (10) projects only just into the bottleneck 
(13) of the refilling bottle (12) when the cover (11) is applied.  

 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to Claim 6, 
characterized 
in that an insert (15) having an orifice (14) for 
the injection needle (10) is arranged in the bottleneck (13) of 

the refilling bottle (12). 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to at least 
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the refilling 

bottle (12) tapers in cross section over its height to the 
bottleneck (13). 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to at least 
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the cross 

section of the cover (11) is designed for application on the 
housing (2) of the felt-tip pen (1) during the refilling process. 
Felt-tip pen with a refilling device according to at least 
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the length of 

the injection needle (10) is calculated such that it extends only 
into a free space above the tampon (5) of the felt-tip pen (1) 

after piercing the felt-tip pen (1).
