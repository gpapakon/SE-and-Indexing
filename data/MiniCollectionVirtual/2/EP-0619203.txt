<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle glovebox assembly comprising a glovebox body 1 
and a carrier bracket 9 for supporting the glovebox body 

and attached to the glovebox body by a hinge member. At 
least one mounting member 11 attachable to a vehicle 

internal structure is provided for mounting the glovebox 
body in the vehicle by means of the carrier bracket 9. 

The latter and the at least one mounting member 11 are 
provided with respective complementary hooking means 

35, 51. After attachment of the glovebox body 1 to the 
carrier bracket 9, the latter is hooked onto the 

mounting member(s) 11.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a vehicle glovebox 
assembly enabling easy mounting of a glovebox into a 
vehicle. It also extends to a method of mounting a 
glovebox in a vehicle using such an assembly. Gloveboxes are hingeable compartments normally fitted 
into or under the vehicle dash at a time towards the end 
of the vehicle assembly process. As a result, the 
person fitting the glovebox is working in a cramped 
environment inside the vehicle and also under somewhat 
poorly lit conditions. The glovebox is fitted, usually by screw fixing to a 
bracket arrangement prefixed inside the vehicle. The 
person has to hold the glovebox in the correct alignment 
and screw it in place, e.g. using screws and an 
air-powered tool. The glovebox is a relatively heavy 
item and continuous work of this kind makes the 
operator's hand tire. Also, by holding the glovebox 
steady in correct alignment in one hand and operating 
the air-tool whilst in the other hand, keeping the screw 
attached to the end of the tool is difficult. The 
person does not have a free hand. These factors and the conditions referred to above lead 
to inefficiency. The operator can let the glovebox slip 
out of alignment before the screws are in place and the 
screws can fall from the end of the tool. It is also 
difficult to mate the screws with their designated holes  
 
whilst the glovebox is in position. As the person's hand tires during the work shift, 
tendency for these problems to arise increases, thus slowing the work rate. Published patent specification no. JP-A-61-125947 describes a vehicle glovebox 
assembly comprising a glovebox body consisting of a container installed on a 
reinforcing panel A subframe is mounted within a recess of the vehicle by means of 
respective complementary hooking means provided on the subframe and the dashboard 
of the vehicle. The glovebox body is attached to the subframe by means of a locking 
mechanism. However, this arrangement also gives rise to the aforementioned problems 
during assembly. A new form of assembly and a method of using same have now been devised which 
overcome the aforementioned problems. Thus, a first aspect of the present intention provides a vehicle glovebox assembly 
comprising a glovebox body, a carrier bracket for supporting the glovebox body and 
attached to the glovebox body by a hinge member, and at least one mounting member 
situated within a recess in the vehicle for mounting the glovebox body in the vehicle by 
means of the carrier bracket, characterised in that the

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle glovebox assembly, comprising a glovebox body (1), a carrier bracket 
(7) for supporting the glovebox body (1) and attached to the glovebox body (1) by a 

hinge member (27), and at least one mounting member (9, 11) situated within a recess 
(3) in the vehicle for mounting the glovebox body (1) in the vehicle by means of the 

carrier bracket (7), characterised in that said carrier bracket (7) and said at least one 
mounting member (9, 11) are provided with respective complementary hooking means 

(33, 35, 49, 51) so that after the glovebox body (1) is attached to the carrier bracket (7), 
the carrier bracket (7) can be hooked onto the at least one mounting member (9, 11). 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the respective hooking means 
comprise a projection (49,51) on the at least one mounting member (9,11) and an 

opening (33,35) in the carrier bracket (7). 
An assembly according to claim 2, comprising a plurality of mounting members 
(9,11), each provided with a projection (49,51) and wherein the carrier bracket (7) is 

provided with a plurality of openings (33,35). 
An assembly according to claim 3, wherein the projections are tabs (49,51) and 
the openings are slots (33,35). 
An assembly according to claim 3, wherein the projections (49,51) are pins and 
the openings (33,35) are substantially circular holes. 
An assembly according to any preceding claim, wherein the carrier bracket (7) 
is provided with means (36-39) for securing it to the vehicle after the respective 

hooking means (49,51,33,35) have been engaged. 
An assembly according to any preceding claim, wherein the mounting means 
comprises a side bracket (11) and a centre bracket (9).  

 
A completed assembly according to any preceding claim. 
A vehicle comprising a completed assembly according to claim 8. 
A method of mounting a glovebox body in a vehicle, comprising the steps of 
attaching the glovebox body (1) to a carrier bracket (7) by means of a hinge member 

(27), providing at least one mounting member (9, 11) within a recess (3) in the vehicle 
for mounting the glovebox body (1) in the vehicle by means of the carrier bracket (7), 

characterised in that said carrier bracket (7) and said at least one mounting member (9, 
11) are provided with respective complementary hooking means (33, 35, 49, 51), and 

the glovebox body (1) is mounted in the vehicle by first attaching the glovebox body 
(1) to the carrier bracket (7) and then engaging the respective hooking means (33, 35, 

49, 51) to hook the carrier bracket (7) onto the at least one mounting member (9, 11). 
A method according to claim 10 wherein after hooking of the carrier bracket (7) 
onto the art least one mounting member (9,11), the carrier bracket (7) is then secured to 

a part of the vehicle.
