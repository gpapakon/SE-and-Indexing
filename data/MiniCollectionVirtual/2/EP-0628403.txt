<ABSTRACT>
The pressure columns (16, 17) are connected to the slide (3) via ball-and-socket joints (42-45). The sockets (44, 45) are situated inside the pressure columns (16, 17) and the balls (42, 43) are arranged above the slide (3), to which they are connected. This means that when the slide (3) is loaded in an excentric fashion, no bending moments are transferred to the pressure columns (16, 17). The entire underside of the slide (3) is available for accommodating connecting elements for a tool.

inside of the corresponding pressure column 

(14,15,16,17), and each pressure column (14,15,16,17)  
 

extends through a movable seal mounted to a lower covering 
end plate of the machine frame, by means of which the 

inner space of the machine frame is sealed off against 
the area of the ram (3), and in that the respective pivotal 

points of the ball- and -socket points at the ram (3) 
in its upper dead center position are located inside of 

the area enclosed by the respective seal. 
Single shaft punch press with a ram connected

in that the socket of the respective ball- and 
-socket joints is located inside of the respective pressure 

column (14,15,16,17) and the ball thereof is firmly 
mounted to the ram. 
Single shaft punch press with a ram connected 
at four points according to one of the preceding 

claims, characterized in 

that the eccentric shaft (2) includes a 
center eccentric section (18) and at both sides thereof 

one further eccentric section (19,20), 
that a structure (24-32) for balancing mass 
forces occurring in operation of the punch press is present, 

which structure is drivingly connected to the center 
eccentric section (18),

of the lever arrangement form single arm lever pairs 

(6,6A;7,7A and 8,8A;9,9A) with a respective first (35) 
and a second, opposite end (36), whereby the lever sections 

(6,6A;7,7A and 8,8A;9,9A) are pivotally mounted at 
the first end via a bolt (21) common to all to a respective 

rod member (4,5;4A,4B;5A,5B) and at the second end 
(36) to the machine frame (2), and the further pivotal  

 
points (10,11,12,13) are located between the respective 

two ends (35;36), 
that the lever units (6,6A;7,7A,8,8A,9,9A)
