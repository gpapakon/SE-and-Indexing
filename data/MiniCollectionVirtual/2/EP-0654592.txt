<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a two-cycle diesel engine comprising an
exhaust passage with an exhaust control valve for controlling
the aperture of said exhaust passage and a scavenge passage
arrangement with a scavenging control valve for controlling the
rate of scavenging.Some vehicles equipped with two-cycle diesel engines are equipped with an
exhaust control valve to variably control the position of the upper edge of the exhaust
passage, which makes possible the variable control of the exhaust timing and
compression ratio. There are also vehicles equipped with a scavenging bypass passage,
which links the various crank chambers, and others having a scavenging control valve
providing aperture control to variably control the rate of scavenging among the various
crank chambers.A two-cycle diesel engine of the crankcase compression type
having a control valve to control the amount of air flow to the
combustion chamber and an exhaust control valve is described in
the United States Patent No. 5,178,104. Said valves are
controlled by a CPU to improve the exhaust gas composition at
low and mid ranges of said diesel engine.In the prior art, the engine operation control devices that controlled the apertures
of the aforementioned control valves usually performed that aperture control of the
foregoing control valves according to engine rpm and accelerator aperture (load).The above described operation control devices of the prior art exercised control
of the various control valves according to engine rpm and accelerator aperture, but no
particular consideration was given to control these valves prior to and during engine
starting. Thus, prior to and during staring, these valves sometimes were not in
appropriate positions, causing poor staring properties, and degradation of emission
properties directly after starting due to smoke evolution and the like. In addition, since diesel engines are not normally equipped with a throttle valve,
during braking and the like when fuel is not being supplied, a large amount of low
temperature air is emitted through the exhaust system This can cause excessive cooling
of the catalytic converter and the deterioration of its cleansing ability.Furthermore, the above mentioned exhaust control valve and scavenging control
valve are generally driven by step motors, entailing limitations upon the speed with at
they may be operated. During rapid acceleration, the response of the aforementioned
control valves is sluggish, with respect to the response speed for controlling fuel injection,
and as
