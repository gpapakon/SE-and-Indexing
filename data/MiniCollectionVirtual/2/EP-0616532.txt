<ABSTRACT>
It is a purpose of this invention to provide a means of treating various central nervous system (CNS) injuries to prevent or minimize damage to the CNS. A novel use has been found for some previously known compounds which are inhibitory agonists of the peripheral-type BZ receptors. It is another purpose of this invention to provide a means of speeding the recovery of tissue damaged through injury to the CNS. The above described inhibitory agonists of the peripheral-type BZ receptors are useful for this purpose, and provide an easily administrable medication. Additionally, a means is provided for screening for new compounds which will act as inhibitory agonists of the peripheral-type BZ receptors and therefore which can be used for treating CNS injuries and for speeding the recovery of tissue damaged through such injuries.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONUse of Peripheral-Type Benzodiazepine Sites for Treatment of CNS Trauma or DiseaseBackground of the InventionA) Head InjuryAlthough the brain makes up only 2% of the entire body's weight, it receives 15% of the heart's output of blood and uses up 20% of the oxygen consumed by the body. An organ of this caliber is most vital to survival; within it are control centers for all the senses: sight, smell, touch, hearing, as well as control centers for breathing, hormonal release and all other basic homeostatic functions essential for survival. Damage which renders any portion of the brain dysfunctional can have a devastating effect on an animal's existence, causing neurological and medical problems, and often times death.Different parts of the brain may be damaged in a wide variety of ways. Common causes of brain injury include vascular diseases and disorders, tumors, infections and actual head trauma.Vascular disorders can be broken down into three main categories: (1) Problems involving hypoxia, ischemia, and infarction; (2) Intracranial hemorrhage; and (3) Hypertensive cerebrovascular disease.The brain's dependence on a constant blood supply is of critical importance; it depends on oxygen-rich blood and glucose to function, and the . brain is only able to store enough glucose to keep it running for one minute. After four minutes of blood deprivation, irreversible neuronal damage begins. There are two types of acute ischemic injury: (a) ischemic (hypoxic) encephalopathy occurs with a general decrease in cerebral blood flow and causes widespread damage; (b) cerebral infarction occurs following a severe drop or cessation in blood flow to one 

 localized area of the brain. The latter is usually due to a local vascular occlusion and is what many people refer to as "stroke."Vascular occlusions may be due to clots or arterial plagues but may be due to embolisms (usually from the heart) as well. Intracranial hemorrhage includes intracerebral, subarachnoid, and mixed intracerebral/ subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage usually results from the rupture of aneurysms in hypertensive patients, causing a gradual neurologic deficit such as paralysis, sensory loss, coma or even death. The mortality rate is 40%. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is more superficial and occurs suddenly, usually with physical exertion. 20-50% of these patients die with the first rupture. Mixed intracerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhages are usually associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVM's), which are tangles of abnormal
