<ABSTRACT>
A flat tube (2) for a heat exchanger consists of a bent metal strip (1) and has a supporting web (7, 8) in its interior between the flat tube sides (3, 4). The metal strip (1) is solder plated on at least one side, and the supporting web (7, 8) is configured such that it has a bearing surface (9, 10) which is soldered on the flat tube side (3) to the tube wall. Heat exchangers having flat tubes (2) of this type are particularly suitable for use in motor vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
1. A flat tube for a heat exchanger and which is 
formed from a metal strip (1) consisting of a bent 

material which is solder-plated on one side and which 
at least at a location which forms the tube seam has an 

overlapping zone (14) while in the interior of the 
tube, between the flat sides (3, 4) of the tube, there 

is extending in the longitudinal direction of the tube 
and formed by a correspondingly bent over part of the 

metal strip a bracing web (7, 8), at least one bearing 
surface (9, 10) of the bracing web being provided with 

the other side (3, 4) of the flat tube (2), 
characterised in that the overlapping zone (14) is 

formed by two parallel extending adjacently disposed 
bracing webs (7, 8) while as bearing surfaces (9, 10) 

on the adjacent tube flat side (3) each of the bracing 
webs (7, 8) has a rim bent over at a right-angle, the 

bracing webs (7, 8) and the bearing surface (9, 10) 
being formed by at least two edges of the metal strip 

(1) which are bent over twice in the same direction and 
which are disposed approximately in the middle of the 

flat sides (3, 4) and in that the metal strip (1) is 
solder-plated on the side forming the outside of the 

tube and in that one side of the bearing surface is 
formed by the solder-plated surface of the metal strip 

(1) while the flat tube (2) is soldered both in the 
overlapping zone (14) and also on the bearing surface 

(9, 10, 16).  
 
2. A flat tube according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that there are extending in the longitudinal direction 

of the tube (2) additional bracing webs (18) which are 
formed by inwardly pointing folds of the metal strip 

(1).
