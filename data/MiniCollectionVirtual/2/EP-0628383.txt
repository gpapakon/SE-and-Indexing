<ABSTRACT>
A hand screw clamp (10) includes first and second 
jaws (12,14) and a pair of threaded rods (30), each having a handle (32) 

for manual rotation. Two first couplers (44) are mounted to 
the first jaw (12) and coupled to the threaded rods (30), and two 

releasable couplers (50) are mounted to the second jaw (14) and 
coupled to the threaded rods (30). The releasable couplers (50) 

each include a threaded portion (52) engageable with the 
threaded rods (30) and a slidable portion (54) sized to 

accommodate sliding movement of the threaded rods (30). A 
push plate (60) is movably mounted to the second jaw (14) and 

engaged with both of the releasable couplers (50). This 
push plate (60) is movable between a first position, in 

which both of the threaded portions (52) are engaged with 
the rods (30) and manual rotation of the handles (32) moves the 

second jaw (14) along the threaded rods (30), and a second 
position, in which both of the threaded portions (52) are 

disengaged from the threaded rods (30) and the threaded rods (30) 
are free to slide past the slidable portions (54) without 

rotation of the threaded rods (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hand-screw clamp according to the
preamble part of claim 1.Hand-screw clamps have long been a preferred clamp for
cabinet makers and other woodworkers. Conventionally, such
clamps include two jaws which are interconnected by two
threaded rods. Threaded couplers are provided on each of the
rods, rotatably mounted in each of the jaws. Typically, each
threaded rod has two threaded portions which are threaded in
opposite senses, and the threaded rods can be manually
rotated to adjust the tilt angle between the first and second
jaws, and to clamp a workpiece between the jaws.
Conventional hand-screw clamps suffer from the disadvantage
that they require extensive rotation of the threaded rods to
move the jaws from a fully-opened to a fully-closed position.A hand-screw clamp as known from US-A-368 278 is equipped
with an actuation element for releasing both threaded
couplers from their respective threaded engagements with the
threaded rods. Upon disengagement of the couplers, the second
jaw can be moved along the threaded rods without rotating the
threaded rods. After releasing the actuation elements,
springs return the couplers into their threaded engagement
with the threaded rods. The actuation element is movable
parallel to the axis of both threaded rods and in the plane
of the axis. Said known hand-screw clamp represents relevant
prior art mentioned in the preamble part of Claim 1. A hand-screw clamp as known from US-A-3 220 721, Fig. 2,
contains a slide in the second jaw, constituting both
threaded couplers which are adapted to couple the second jaw
with both threaded rods in an extended position of the slide.
The slide is movable within the plane of the axis of both
threaded rods, and perpendicularly with respect to said axis
within the second jaw. A head of said slide protrudes from
one end of the second jaw. The engagement position of the
slide is made by a spring supported in the second jaw. Upon
movement of the slide into a retracted position, the threaded
engagement between the slide and both threaded rods is
released for free sliding movement of the second jaw along
both threaded rods.GB-A-563 870 discloses a manually operable clamp including
releasable couplers mounted to a fast-adjusting jaw for
cooperation with the rods. Both couplers are connected via a
transverse plate which is movable along a direction
substantially transverse to a plane passing through both
rods. Along the sides of each rod facing one of the couplers,
a plurality of shallow lateral grooves is

<CLAIMS>
A hand screw clamp (10) comprising

first and second jaws (12,14);
a pair of threaded rods (30) coupled to the first jaw and
each comprising a handle

(32) for manual rotation;
a pair of releasable couplers (50) mounted to the second
jaw (14) and coupled to the threaded rods (30), said

releasable couplers (50) each comprising a threaded
portion (52) engageable with the respective threaded rod

and a slidable portion (54) sized to accommodate sliding
movement of the respective threaded rod;
an actuating element (60) movably mounted to the second
jaw (14) and engaged with both of the releasable couplers

(44,50), said actuating element (60) positioned adjacent
the second jaw (14) said actuating element (60) movable

between an engaged position, in which both of the
threaded portions (52) are engaged with the respective

threaded rods (30) and manual rotation of the handles
(32) moves the second jaw (14) along the threaded rods

(30), and a disengaged position, in which both of the
threaded portions (52) are disengaged from the respective

threaded rods (30) and the threaded rods (30) are free to
slide past the slidable portions without rotation of the

threaded rods (30),
Characterised in that
a pair of first couplers (44) is mounted to the first jaw
(12) for coupling the first jaw to the threaded rods (30);
said actuating element (60) is movable along a direction
substantially transverse to a plane passing through the

threaded rods (30), said threaded rods (30) passing through openings
provided in the releasable couplers (50), the threaded portion (52) and

the slidable portion (54) being provided on opposing sides of the
peripheral surface of each opening, 
said releasable couplers (50) being mounted in cylindrical
recesses (26) of said second jaw (14) such that they can

be rotated
about an axis substantially transverse to a plane passing

through the threaded rods (30) and can be
axially moved in said recesses (26) from

an engaged position where said threaded portion (52)
engages said respective threaded rod to a second

position where the slidable portion (54) allows sliding
movement of the respective threaded rod,
that each releasable coupler (50) defines an outer
flange (56) and a groove (58) adjacent to said flange (56),
that said actuation element (60) is a push plate
defining a pair of openings and associated flanges (62),
and that the outer flanges (56) of both releasable
couplers (50) are inserted into said openings of said

push plate such that flanges (62) associated with said
openings fit into said groove (58) adjacent said

flanges (56) of said releasable couplers and rotatably
