<ABSTRACT>
Source sentences in the first language to be translated are 
entered to an input unit 12. Through the input unit 12 source sentences 

are entered to a polysemous word settlement unit 20 via an entered 
sentences analyzing unit 14. A characteristics table generation part 30 

stores a characteristics table in which each meaning is preliminarily 
associated wi
th each characteristic with respect to polysemous words. A 
characteristics record generation part 22 generates a characteristics 

record to compare the characteristics table and the characteristics 
record, thereby selecting and outputting the meaning of the polysemous 

word based on the characteristics in the source sentences. Each word 
whose ambiguity has been settled at the polysemous word settlement unit 

20 is translated at a correlative translation processing unit 40 to be 
output to an output unit 46. Thus ambiguity of the meaning of a 

polysemous word in a first language having a plurality of meanings is 
settled so as to make source sentences in the first language correspond 

in the most appropriate way to the translated sentences in the second 
language.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a language processing system, and
in particular to machines such as computers used to translate source
sentences in a first language into translated sentences in a second
language.A conventional machine translation apparatus is known in which a
computer carries out analysis, such as morphological analysis, of the
structure of source sentences expressed in a first language so as to
divide the source sentences into words so that each sentence in the first
language is associated with a counterpart in the second language (see JP-A
2-308370 and JP-A 3-8082 and the like).Such machine translation apparatus performs structural analysis,
such as correlative analysis, with respect to source sentences in a first
language to be translated. Temporary correlation is attached to a
portion of the source sentence whose meaning is ambiguous, so that the
portion is translated into the second language by making use of the word
order in the source sentence. With respect to ambiguous portions,
information in the other portions is utilized so as to settle the
ambiguity thereof to permit translation into the target language.However it is very difficult to associate source sentences with the
translation sentences on a word level when the source sentences contain
words having a plurality of meanings (hereinafter referred to as
polysemous words) that make the whole sentence ambiguous. Since it is
necessary to perform case-by-case analysis of the usage of each word
through detailed rules determined by sufficient analysis, such as
syntactic analysis, it so happens that an indefinite number of
translations can be associated with the polysemous word in source
sentences and one meaning cannot be selected.US 4942526 describes a method for automatically generating a
lexicon for storing cooccurrence relations utilized for determining
whether or not a sequence of words in a given sentence described in
natural language is semantically correct. The lexicon is derived by
establishing hypothesized cooccurrence relations, and then determining
whether such relation is valid or not, based on parsing an actual text
file.Accordingly there is known a method for machine translation wherein
a verb conversion table is formed as a means for determining the meaning
of polysemous words for the process of assigning a translation 
word in a second language to a polysemous verb in a first language, the
verb conversion table describing translation and usage for each
polysemous verb so that the table can be referred to in

<CLAIMS>
A language processing system for machine translation wherein
source sentences in a first language which contain polysemous words

having a plurality of meanings are analyzed to obtain semantic
information and grammatical information, said semantic information and

grammatical information being utilized to translate the source sentences
into target sentences in a second language, the system being


characterised by
:

means for storing a characteristics table (56) describing the
relation between sufficient characteristics and meanings corresponding

to said sufficient characteristics, said sufficient characteristics
being at least one of either semantic information or grammatical

information corresponding to a single meaning of the plural meanings of
a polysemous word, the characteristics table being derived from a

plurality of sentences (34) each of which contains a polysemous word
expressed in an unambiguous manner;
means for determining whether at least one of either the semantic
information or the grammatical information of an analyzed sentence

containing a polysemous word matches one of said sufficient
characteristics; and
means for selecting the meaning of the polysemous word in
accordance with the matched sufficient characteristics.
The language processing system of claim 1, wherein the
characteristics table further describes the relation between required

characteristics and the meaning corresponding to said required
characteristics, said required characteristics being at least one of

semantic information and grammatical information corresponding to all
the sentences associated with one meaning of the polysemous word, said

system further comprising means for determining whether at least one of
either the semantic information or the grammatical information of an

analyzed sentence containing a polysemous word matches one of said
required characteristics, wherein the meaning of the polysemous word is

selected in accordance with the matched sufficient characteristics and
matched required characteristics.
The language processing system of claim 2, wherein the
characteristics table further describes the relation between dependent 

characteristics and the meaning corresponding to said dependent
characteristics, said dependent characteristics being information which

is at least one of either the semantic information or grammatical
information corresponding to two or more meanings of said polysemous

word; said system further comprising means for calculating a similarity
between one of either the semantic information or the grammatical

information and said sufficient characteristics and required
characteristics based on said sentences included in the scope of the

one of either the semantic information or grammatical information does

not match said sufficient and required characteristics; and means for
selecting the meaning of said polysemous word based on the result of the

characterised by

storing a characteristics table (56) describing the relation
between sufficient characteristics and meanings corresponding to said

sufficient characteristics, said sufficient characteristics being at
