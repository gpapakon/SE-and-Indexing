<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a sealing construction for a 
suction box of a suction roll in a paper machine and 

a method in sealing operation of a suction roll. The 
sealing construction comprises a seal (10) provided 

in a holder (11) and loading means, preferably at 
least one loading hose (12a,12b) between the holder 

(11) and the seal (10). The seal (10) is pressed 
against the inner face (T') of the roll mantle of the 

suction roll (T) by means of the pressure of a 
medium that has been supplied into the loading 

hose. There are locking means (13) between the seal 
(10) and the holder (11), by means of which locking 

means the seal (10) can be locked in the desired 
position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a suction roll according to the preamble of Claim 1 and a method of sealing a suction box of a suction roll according to the preamble of Claim 13. The preambles of Claims 1 and 13 are based on the disclosure of DE-A-1 146 350. The wear of the seals in suction rolls has become a problem in an attempt to achieve 
longer servicing intervals. In a prior-art construction, in view of producing an 
efficient and well sealed suction roll, the seals are pressed pneumatically against the 
inner face bf the roll mantle of the roll. In such a case, the compression force is 
maintained constantly, and the seal is worn rapidly. In the present application, an 
efficient solution is described for avoiding the wear of the seal. According to the 
present invention, the seal rib is provided with locking means. The seal is first 
pressed against the roll mantle. After the negative pressure has been developed in the 
suction box, the seal is locked in its holder. Finally, the pressure can be discharged 
from the loading means of the seal. When an arrangement in accordance with the 
invention is used, even the water lubrication can be omitted. Moreover, the seals 
may be provided with chamfering, which permits gradual equalization of the 
pressures in the perforations in the suction roll as the perforations in the roll depart 
from the zone of negative pressure while the roll revolves. The suction roll in accordance with the present invention 
is mainly characterized 
by the features 
defined in the characterizing portion of Claim 1. On the other hand, the method of sealing the suction box of a suction roll 
in accordance with the present invention is mainly characterized by the features defined in the characterizing portion of Claim 13.  
 In the following, the invention will be described with reference to some preferred 
embodiments of the invention illustrated in the figures in the accompanying drawings, 
the invention being, however, not supposed to be confined to said embodiments 
alone. Figure 1A is an illustration of a suction roll in a paper machine, by means of which 
suction roll water is removed out of the web. Figure 1B shows a seal holder for prior-art sealing operation and a loading hose 
placed on the bottom of said holder. Figure 1C is a sectional view taken along the line I-I in Fig. 1B. Figure 2 shows a novel seal construction in accordance with the present invention, 
which comprises seal locking means. Figure 3A shows a second embodiment, in which the locking is accomplished
