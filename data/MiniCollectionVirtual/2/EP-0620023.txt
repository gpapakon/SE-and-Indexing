<ABSTRACT>
An over-the-wire catheter (10) includes an elongated shaft (11) 
having a guidewire lumen (14) extending substantially the entire length 

of the catheter for receiving a guidewire (5). The catheter has a 
length relative to the guidewire such that the guidewire can 

simultaneously extend out the proximal and distal ends of the 
catheter. The catheter shaft includes a window opening (20) the 

guidewire lumen to the exterior of the catheter. The window is of 
such a length and is so located on the shaft that as the catheter 

is withdrawn proximally over the guidewire, the window is exposed 
to provide access to the guidewire before the proximal end of the 

guidewire is disposed distal to the proximal end of the catheter and 
such that the distal end of the catheter is exposed to provide 

access to the guidewire extending therefrom before the proximal end 
of the guidewire is disposed distal to the window.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catheters placed in the body of a 
patient such as in the cardiovascular system and, in particular, to 
a catheter which permits exchange of the catheter while maintaining 
in the patient the guidewire over which the catheter is inserted. Catheters are placed at various locations within a patient for 
a wide variety of purposes and medical procedures. For example 
only, one type of catheter is a balloon dilatation catheter which 
is used in the treatment of a vascular stenosis. Such a catheter 
has a balloon at its distal end which is intended to be placed, in 
a deflated condition, within the stenosis, and then inflated while 
in the stenosis to expand radially the stenosed lumen of the blood 
vessel. Typically, the placement of such catheters involves the use 
of a guidewire which may be advanced through the patient's vasculature 
to the location which is to be treated. The catheter, which 
has a lumen adapted to receive the guidewire, is advanced over the 
wire which guides the catheter to the location to be treated. In 
so-called over-the-wire catheters, the guidewire lumen extends the 
entire length of the catheter and the guidewire received therein is 
entirely within the catheter except for the guidewire ends which 
extend from the distal and proximal ends of the catheter. While over-the-wire catheters have many advantages traceable 
to a full-length guidewire lumen, including good stiffness and pushability 
and the availability of the guidewire lumen for pressure 
measuremant and distal dye injections, such catheters do suffer some 
shortcomings. For example, it is generally necessary for the guidewire and 
catheter to be advanced together through the guiding catheter and  
 
patient. Specifically, if the guidewire is first located across the 
stenosis and then the distal end of the catheter is threaded onto 
the proximal end of the guidewire, the physician would be unable to 
advance the catheter without undesirably also advancing the guidewire. 
That results because, unless an extension wire which can be 
twice the length of the catheter, is used, there is no portion of 
the guidewire extending out of the catheter that can be secured to 
ensure that only the catheter moves distally. Requiring the user 
to advance the catheter and guidewire together through the guiding 
catheter is undesirable because if it turns out that the user is not 
able ultimately to cross the stenosis with the guidewire, then the 
dilatation procedure will have to be aborted, resulting in the

can be exposed so as to provide access to the guidewire therethrough 
before the proximal end of the guidewire is disposed distal to the 

proximal end of the catheter and such that said catheter can also 
be withdrawn proximally over the guidewire so that the distal end 

of the catheter is outside of the patient so as to expose and render 
accessible a portion of the guidewire extending from the distal end 

of the catheter before the proximal end of the guidewire is disposed 
distal to the window element, comprising the steps of: 


(a) grasping the proximal end of the guidewire and 
withdrawing the catheter proximally along the guidewire as much 

as possible so as to expose the window and render it accessible; 
(b) holding the guidewire at the proximal end of the 
window; 
(c) sliding the catheter proximally along a portion of 
the guidewire; 
(d) repeating steps (b) and (c) until the distal end of 
the catheter is exposed and the guidewire extending therefrom 

accessible; and 
(e) grasping the guidewire distal of the distal end of 
the catheter and pulling the catheter off the proximal end of 

the guidewire. 
A method for withdrawing a catheter over a guidewire disposed 
within a patient, the guidewire having proximal and distal ends, the 

 
catheter having an elongated catheter shaft having open proximal and 

distal ends and a longitudinal guidewire lumen for receiving the 
guidewire and extending substantially the entire length of the 

catheter between the open ends of the catheter shaft, the catheter 
shaft having a length such that the guidewire receivable in said 

lumen can extend out the proximal and distal ends of the catheter, 
said catheter shaft further including first and second window 

elements, each of said window elements opening the guidewire lumen 
to the exterior of the catheter, said window elements each having 

a proximal end and a distal end, the first window element being 
located on the catheter shaft and having a length such that after 

the catheter has been inserted into the patient, the catheter can 
be slid along the guidewire such that a portion of said first window 

element is exposed outside the patient so as to provide access to 
the guidewire therethrough before the proximal end of the guidewire 

is slid to a position distal to the proximal end of the catheter, 
the second window element having a length and being located on the 

catheter shaft such that when said catheter has been slid proximally 
over the guidewire, said second window element is exposed to provide 

access to the guidewire therethrough before the proximal end of the 
guidewire is slid to a position distal to said first window element 

and such that the distal end of the catheter can be exposed outside 
of the patient so as to provide access to a portion of the guidewire 

extending from the distal end of the catheter before the proximal 
end of the guidewire is slid to a position distal to said second 

window element, the method comprising the steps of: 

(a) grasping the proximal end of the guidewire and 
withdrawing the catheter proximally along the guidewire as much 

as possible so as to expose the first window and render it 
accessible; 
(b) holding the guidewire at the proximal end of the 
first window; 
(c) sliding the catheter proximally along a portion of 
the guidewire; 
(d) repeating steps (b) and (c) until the second window 
is exposed so as to provide access to the guidewire therethrough; 
(e) holding the guidewire at the proximal end of the 
second window; 
(f) sliding catheter proximally along a portion of the 
guidewire; 
(g) repeating steps (e) and (f) until the distal end of 
the catheter is exposed and the guidewire extending therefrom 

accessible; and 
(h) grasping the guidewire distal of the distal end of 
the catheter and pulling the catheter off the proximal end of 

the guidewire.
