<ABSTRACT>
A microstrip patch antenna array (10) incorporating a 
plurality of spaced-apart patch radiating elements (32) is 

electromagnetically coupled to a microstrip line (20) 
conductively coupled to a source of signals. Both the 

spaced-apart patch radiating elements (32) and the 
microstrip line (20) are located on the same side of an 

adjacent conductive substrate (12). The microstrip patch 
radiating elements (32) are arranged in a linear co-planar 

array electromagnetically excited by the field created by 
the air substrated microstrip line (20) passing adjacent 

thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to antennas and more 
particularly to microstrip antenna arrays as described in the 
preamble of claim 1. Such an antenna array is known from IEEE 
TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, Vol. 40, No. 8, 
August 1992, New York, USA, pages 950-958: POTHARAZU et al. 
"Analysis and Design of a Leaky-Wave EMC Dipole Array". The antenna array discussed in this article is an, at 
least theoretically, infinite array of dipoles oriented in a 
direction perpendicular to the axis of the microstrip line. 
Dipole radiating elements have, however, different characteristics 
than patch radiating elements. In dipole elements, the 
electric field and the currents are transverse to the currents 
on the feed line, and the degree of coupling depends 
strongly on the cross over position of the dipole, with maximum 
coupling occurring at the end of the dipole.  
 Microstrip patch antennas are desirable 
structures for use in wireless telecommunications, 
particularly in view of their compactness, 
conformability, and general ease of fabrication. One 
major disadvantage of such structures has been a narrow 
bandwidth. A variety of approaches have been utilized 
in an effort to expand the bandwidth of such structures. For example, it is known that bandwidth can be 
increased by increasing the thickness of the microstrip 
antenna patch substrate, or by introducing parasitic 
elements of varying size above and/or below the driven 
element. The addition of parasitic elements stacked 
above and/or below the driven element to increase the 
bandwidth is less desirable in some cases because of the 
physical structure that is required. It would be desirable therefore to produce a 
microstrip antenna structure that would provide the 
desired broad bandwidth without the disadvantage of 
having a physical structure that creates a problem 
respecting the ability to mount it on various support 
structures or becomes too large in size. In accordance with the present invention as defined in claim 1, 
there is disclosed a microstrip patch antenna array 
incorporating a plurality of spaced-apart patch 
radiating elements which are electromagnetically coupled 
to a microstrip line which is connected to a source of 
signals. Both the spaced-apart patch radiating elements 
and the microstrip line are located on the same side of  
 
an adjacent conductive substrate. 
The microstrip patch radiating 
elements are arranged in a linear co-planar array 
electromagnetically excited by the field created by the 
air
