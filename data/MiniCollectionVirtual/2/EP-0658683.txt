<ABSTRACT>
A running tool (17) is provided with a two stage 
piston (22,23) damper which makes a preliminary landing 

(16) at a wellhead to produce a throttled flow of oil and 
decelerate the tool before equipment carried by the tool 

makes a final landing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
In the operation of oil and gas wells, equipment is 
conventionally carried into the well on a running tool and 
landed in a tubular member, such as a spool or spool tree 
at or adjacent to the wellhead. Examples of equipment 
which are landed in this way are casing and tubing strings, 
suspended from a hanger. The string assembly may have a 
very large mass, and in order to avoid impact damage when 
the downward momentum is killed as the equipment is landed, 
the landing should be made at the minimum speed at which 
the running tool can be lowered. However, even at this 
speed high impact loads and pressures occur at the landing. 
Soft landing running tools are known, but these have 
involved the use of active devices which are inappropriate 
in many cases, such as the landing of a tubing string 
hanger in a spool tree. In accordance with the present invention, a running 
tool has a body with means for carrying equipment to be 
landed down through a tubular member, the body having a 
peripheral portion which is movable along the body to vary 
the volume of a chamber which is, in use, filled with a 
liquid, and which has at least one throttled outlet, the 
arrangement being such that, when the running tool is 
lowered through the tubular member, before the equipment is 
finally landed, the peripheral portion is arranged to make 
a preliminary landing at the tubular member, whereupon 
further lowering of the running tool causes the peripheral 
portion to rise along the tool body and to displace liquid 
from the chamber through the outlet, thereby automatically 
decelerating the movement of the tool and cushioning the 
impact of the final landing of the equipment. Preferably the outlet(s) is/are so arranged that the 
throttling effect increases as the peripheral part rises 
along the tool body. With a running tool constructed in this way, initial 
impact loads within the tool are minimised and as the tool  
 
is decelerated, the throttling effect, and hence resistance 
to further downward movement increases until the carried 
equipment makes a soft landing. As a result, component 
strength need not be so high as conventionally and the 
running tool can be used to instal equipment in a wider 
weather window as, in marine operations, the system becomes 
less heave dependent. In practice, the, or at least one of the, throttled 
outlets may be provided by a shuttle of variable cross-section 
which is movable through an opening in the wall of 
the chamber to vary the effective cross-section of the 
opening.

<CLAIMS>
A running tool having a body (17) with means (18) for 
carrying equipment to be landed down through a tubular 

member (10), the body having a peripheral portion (23) 
which is movable along the body to vary the volume of a 

chamber (27) which is, in use, filled with a liquid, and 
which has at least one throttled outlet (28,31), the 

arrangement being such that, when the running tool is 
lowered through the tubular member, before the equipment is 

finally landed, the peripheral portion is arranged to make 
a preliminary landing (16) at the tubular member, whereupon 

further lowering of the running tool causes the peripheral 
portion to rise along the tool body and to displace liquid 

from the chamber through the outlet, thereby automatically 
decelerating the movement of the tool and cushioning the 

impact of the final landing (12) of the equipment. 
A running tool according to claim 1, wherein the 
outlet(s) (28) is/are so arranged that the throttling 

effect increases as the peripheral part (23) rises along 
the tool body (17). 
A running tool according to claim 2, wherein the, or 
at least one of, the throttled outlets is provided by a 

shuttle (29) of variable cross-section which is movable 
through an opening (28) in the wall of the chamber (27) to 

vary the effective cross-section of the opening. 
A running tool according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the peripheral portion is a cylinder (23) 

having radially inwardly projecting annular end walls 
(24,25) sealed to and slidable relatively to the tool body 

(21), one on each axial side of a fixed annular piston (22) 
projecting radially outwardly from the tool body, the 

chamber (27) being provided within the cylinder between the 
piston and the lower end wall of the cylinder. 
A running tool according to claims 3 and 4, wherein 
the shuttle (29) works in a hole (28) through the piston 

and is movable between a lowermost position relatively to 
the piston, in which there is a maximum flow path through 

the opening, and by which it is held by initial engagement 
with the upper end wall (24) of the cylinder, the shuttle 

being allowed to rise through the opening to reduce the 
flow path through the opening (28) by the liquid pressure 

within the cylinder chamber (27) as the cylinder rises 
along the tool body and the upper end wall (24) of the 

cylinder moves away from the piston. 
A running tool according to claim 5, wherein the 
shuttle (29) moves to its uppermost position relatively to 

the piston (22) during a first part of the upward movement 
of the cylinder along the tool body, whereafter a 

substantially constant throttling is provided by the 
outlet(s) (31) from the chamber. 
A running tool according to any one of claims 4 to 6, 
wherein the cylinder (23) is urged to its lowermost 

position relatively to the tool body by a spring (26).
