<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention: The present invention relates to a storage 
and mucosal delivery device for biological or pharmaceutical materials. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to a storage and mucosal 
delivery tube for administering biological or pharmaceutical materials to 
animals. Brief Description of the Prior Art: Generally, it has been know to 
orally administer biological or pharmaceutical materials such as vaccines. 
The celebrated polio vaccine was orally administered by embedding it in 
a sugar cube. Vaccines have been orally administered by metal gavage 
tubes connected to syringes or simply using a syringe without a needle 
attached thereto. U.S. Patent 4,041,991 discloses a passive oral delivery 
system for a rabies vaccine to foxes by imbedding a bite-permeable 
hydrophobic plastic container into a bait and leaving the bait for the 
animals to eat and thus become immunized. By the present invention, there is disclosed a device for storing 
and/or delivering a biologically or pharmaceutically effective amount of 
material to an animal In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention 
encompasses a device for storing and/or delivering an effective amount 
of biological or pharmaceutical material to an animal comprising a tube 
disposed to contain said biological or pharmaceutical material and sealed 
at its ends, and adapted to provide an opening through which the 
biological or pharmaceutical material exits and is administered to an 
intended site of the animal.  Also encompassed by the invention is a method of administering 
to an animal an effective amount of biological or pharmaceutical material 
by providing a tube disposed to contain said biological or pharmaceutical 
material, sealed at its ends, adapted to provide an opening through which 
the biological or pharmaceutical material exits and is administered to an 
intended site of the animal. It has been found that by using the device of the invention, one is 
able to store effective amounts of biological or pharmaceutical materials 
such as vaccines, immunostimulants or drugs at ambient temperature or 
in a frozen condition and/or in liquid nitrogen. It has also been found that 
by the use of the device of the invention, one can actively administer the 
biological or pharmaceutical materials to animals. By the term "actively" 
herein is meant that the animals can be caused to take in a measured 
amount of the biological or pharmaceutical material. The device is 
further advantaged in that it is durable and takes

<CLAIMS>
A device for storing and/or delivering an effective amount of 
biological or pharmaceutical material to an animal comprising a tube 

disposed to contain said biological or pharmaceutical material and sealed 
at its ends and adapted to provide an opening through which the 

biological or pharmaceutical material exits and is administered to an 
intended site of the animal. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein the tube is sufficiently durable 
to withstand conditions at the site of administration. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein the tube is adapted to contain 
a plug before an end seal thereof. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein tube is of a dimension 
sufficient to reach the site of administration. 
The device of Claim 4 wherein the volume of the tube is from 
0.1 to 5 mL. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein the volume is 0.1 to 2 mL. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein the device is sealed at its ends 
by heating or ultrasonic techniques. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein the tube is adapted to open by 
penetrating said tube effectively to release or expel the biological or 

pharmaceutical material. 
The device of Claim 8 wherein the tube is penetrated by 
cutting. 
The device of Claim 8 wherein the tube is penetrated at lower 
and upper sections thereof to effect a release of the biological or 

pharmaceutical material. 
The device of Claim 3 wherein the tube is penetrated at a 
lower and upper sections and provided a plunging means at the upper 

 
section to expel the biological or pharmaceutical material. 
A method of delivering an effective amount of biological or 
pharmaceutical material to an animal by providing a tube disposed to 

contain said biological or pharmaceutical material, sealed at its ends and 
adapted to provide an opening through which the biological or 

pharmaceutical material exits and is administered to an intended cite of 
the animal by puncturing the sealed tube and exiting the material to the 

mucosal membrane of the animal. 
The method of Claim 12 wherein the biological or 
pharmaceutical material is administered orally. 
The method of Claim 12 wherein the material is a vaccine. 
The method of Claim 14 wherein the vaccine is a T.gondii 
vaccine.
