<ABSTRACT>
In order to make an electrical contact on an electrically conductive moulding composed of thermoplastic material which contains metal fibres, a suspension is deposited on the surface of the moulding, which suspension contains an electrically conductive powder as well as a solvent which dissolves or swells the thermoplastic material of the moulding. The deposited suspension can then be dried.

A method for producing an electrical contact on an 
electrically conductive molding, wherein a suspension 

is applied onto the surface of an electrically 
conductive molding made of thermoplastic material 

which contains metal fibers, which suspension 
contains an electrically conductive powder and a 

solvent which solubilizes or causes to swell the 
thermoplastic material of the molding and the 

applied suspension is allowed to dry. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a metal 
powder and/or carbon black is used as the electrically 

conductive powder. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
thermoplastic material of the molding contains steel 

fibers. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a housing 
shell is bonded on a printed circuit board, on which 

an electrical circuit is arranged, such that the 
electrical circuit is enclosed on all sides. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the electrically 
conductive molding is of plate form. 
The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein a metal 
film is bonded on the plate-form molding with the 

aid of the suspension. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
applied suspension also contains an adhesive 

component. 
The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
adhesive component is an organic polymer which can 

be dissolved in the solvent used.  
 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the molding 
has the form of a housing which is assembled 

from two shells, the suspension is spread on the 
contact region of the two shells, the housing shells 

are assembled to form the housing or pressed 
together under pressure and the suspension is 

allowed to dry. 
The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein a thin 
metallic intermediate layer is bonded on in the 

contact region of the two housing shells, which 
layer may have an outwardly projecting contact lug. 
The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the 
suspension is spread on an outlying area on at least 

one housing shell in the vicinity of the contact 
region. 
The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the two 
housing shells mutually engage. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the molding 
has the form of a housing which is assembled 

from two shells, the suspension is spread on the 
contact regions of the two associated shells, the 

suspension is allowed to dry and the housing is then 
assembled. 
The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the 
suspension is spread on an outlying area on at least 

one housing shell in the vicinity of the contact 
region, in order to produce an outer contact. 
The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein a metal 
intermediate layer or conductive seal, which may 

have an outer contact lug, is inserted between two 
housing shells during the assembly of the housing.
