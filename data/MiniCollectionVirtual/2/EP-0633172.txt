<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switchable inertia-controlled brake pressure regulator (1) for hydraulic motor-vehicle brake systems, with a preferably spherical inertial mass (2), by means of the inertia-induced displacement of which along a preferably slightly rising path of motion when the vehicle is braked a conduit section leading from the inlet (4) to an outlet (5) of the brake pressure regulator can be - directly or indirectly - interrupted when a defined inertia force is exceeded. The inertial mass (2) is additionally acted upon by means which can be switched on or off as a function of operating parameters, e.g. as a function of whether an anti-lock brake system (ABS) is functional or not functional or as a function of whether such an anti-lock brake system is exercising control or not at a particular time. The means which additionally act on the inertial mass (2) are designed as means which can be switched on and off in a purely electromagnetic manner, preferably as electromagnetically driven tappets (6.1) or as an electromagnet (6.2) which can be switched on and off and acts by means of its magnetic force, it being possible by switching the means on or off to switch the inertia force of the inertial mass (2) which must be overcome to interrupt the conduit section from a defined first value (Pu1) to a defined, higher, second value (Pu2).
