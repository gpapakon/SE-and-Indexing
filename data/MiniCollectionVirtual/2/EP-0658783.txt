<ABSTRACT>
A plate plastics optical waveguide comprises a 
core portion (3) composed of a polymer containing a 

deuteriumation or a halogen atom, and a clad portion 
(2,7) which surrounds the core portion and composed 

of a polymer having a refractive index lower than 
that of the core portion. The plastics optical 

waveguide which has a core portion comprising a 
deuterated or halogenated polyacrylate or 

polysiloxane shows an optical loss of 0.1 dB/cm or 
less for a light at a wavelength of 1.3 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plastics 
optical waveguides, more particularly to a plate 
plastics optical waveguide useful as optical 
components such as optical couplers or multiplexers 
for optical communication or image transmission. As for a base material for optical components or 
optical fibers, generally inorganic substances such 
as silica glass and multicomponent glass are used 
because their propagation loss is low and their 
transmission band is wide. On the other hand, optical components using 
plastics as a base material have been developed. 
Plastics optical materials used therefore have a good 
fabrication flexibility and the controllability of 
optical properties compared with inorganic optical 
materials, and therefore, much attention has been 
paid thereon with an expectation that optical 
waveguides having relatively good characteristics 
could be produced with ease using them. 
Representative techniques for producing of plate 
plastics optical waveguides include a selective  
 
photopolymerization and a utilization of a 
photosensitive resin. The selective photopolymerization method is a 
technique in which monomers contained in a polymer 
are selectively polymerized to change the refractive 
index to make a pattern-like optical waveguide. More 
particularly, at first a mask having a predetermined 
pattern is mounted on a polymer sheet or substrate 
composed of a transparent polymer such as 
polycarbonate which contains a low refractive index 
monomer such as methyl acrylate, and the sheet or 
substrate are irradiated with ultraviolet rays 
through the mask to selectively polymerize the low 
refractive index monomer in accordance with the 
pattern. The photopolymerized portion of the polymer 
has a lower refractive index than the polymer matrix. 
Then the polymer sheet is heated in vacuum to remove 
unreacted monomers which remain in areas unexposed 
with ultraviolet rays. As a result, unexposed 
portion of the polymer consists of the high 
refractive index polymer alone. Thus, a patterned 
sheet can be obtained in which a high refractive 
index portion serving as a core is formed in 
accordance with a predetermined pattern. Finally, 
the patterned sheet is sandwiched by a clad composed 
of a low refractive index polymer to produce an 
objective optical part. On the other hand, according to the method which 
uses a photosensitive polymer, a photosensitive 
polymer is pattern-wise exposed to a light to cause 
cross linking selectively, followed by development to 
remove unexposed
