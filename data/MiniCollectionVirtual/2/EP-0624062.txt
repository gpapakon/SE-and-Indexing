<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses the use of pectinesterase to demethoxylate high-methoxylated pectins. The pectinesterase makes possible the preparation of food containing fruit or vegetables in a more efficient way. Specifically, fruit and vegetable jams, jellies, compotes and soups are prepared without or with greatly reduced sugar and pectin addition. The present invention also discloses a process for producing apple sauce comprising the use of pectinesterase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of 
pectinesterase (E.C. 3.1.1.11) in the preparation of food 
containing fruits or vegetables. Specifically, the invention 
relates to the use of pectinesterase in the treatment of 
fruit or vegetables that is in the demethoxylation of pectin. 
The treated fruits or vegetables are then used in the 
preparation of jams, jellies, compotes, sauces and soups. The 
present invention further discloses a modification to the 
standard US apple sauce preparation process. Fruit and vegetable jams and jellies are normally 
prepared by cooking pretreated fruit and subsequent cooling. 
The pectin present in the fruit gelates, thereby giving the 
jam or jelly its rheological characteristics. 
The pectin is mainly responsible for this gel formation due 
to its gelifying power. The gelifying potential of pectin is 
dependent on several conditions, mainly: 
dry substance content or brix, pH of the fruit or vegetable, concentration of pectin normally present, degree of methylation of the pectin. Pectins are major constituents of the cell walls of 
edible parts of fruits and vegetables. The middle lamella 
which are situated between the cell walls are mainly build up 
from protopectin which is the insoluble form of pectin. 
Pectins are considered as intercellular adhesives and due to 
their colloid nature they also have an important function in 
the waterregulation of plants. Waterbinding capacity is  
 
greatly increased by the amount of hydrophylic hydroxyl and 
carboxyl groups. The amount of pectin can be very high. For 
example, lemon peels are reported to contain pectin upto 30% 
of their dry weight, orange peels contain from 15-20% and 
apple peels about 10% (Norz, K., 1985. Zucker und SÃ¼sswaren 
Wirtschaft 38 5-6). From a chemical point of view pectin consist of 
methoxylated polygalacturonic acid residues. Pectins are 
classified in different categories based on the degree of 
esterification and the degree of polymerisation. On the basis of the degree of esterification pectins 
are divided into two groups: 
1) high-methoxylated pectins with a degree of 
esterification higher than 50%, and 2) low-methoxylated pectins having a degree of 
esterification lower than 50%. Both of these groups are capable of forming gels, 
however these gels differ in the mechanism by which they are 
formed. The high-methoxylated pectins form gels based on 
dehydration and electrical neutralisation of colloidal 
pectin-agglomerates. Gelation is stimulated if the pH is 
about 3 (dependent on the
