<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sealing device for sealing pipelines for gaseous or fluid media, which contains a closable housing 4, which engages around the pipeline in the manner of a socket, and a sealing element 8 which consists of an elastomeric material, is arranged in the form of a ring in the housing 4 and exhibits an annular bead 12 which projects in the direction of the wall of the pipeline and exhibits a sealing surface which can be rested against the wall. According to the invention, the sealing element 8 contains an annular gap 13 which subdivides the annular bead 12 in the axial direction into a first radial bead 14 on the interior of the seal and into a second radial bead 18 on the exterior of the seal, the gap 13 extending from the sealing surface 15 into the annular bead 12 with such an inclination that an acute-angled sealing lip 21 is formed on the second radial bead 18 adjacent to the gap 13. The first radial bead 14 may exhibit, on the interior of the seal, an axial annular groove in the form of an undercut 16 which forms, on the radial bead 14, an acute-angled sealing lip 17 which is directed towards the interior of the seal.

A sealing device for sealing conduits for gaseous or 
fluid media, including a closeable housing (4) embracing the 

conduit, and a sealing member (8) which consists of 
elastomeric material and is arranged in an annular 

configuration in the housing (4) and has on its two axial 
edge regions two axially spaced annular beads (12) projecting 

radially inwards to bear against the conduit (2) to be sealed 
when the housing (4) is clamped, wherein each annular bead 

(12) is divided by an annular gap (13) into a first, inner 
and a second, outer radial bead (14 and 18, resp.), and the 

inner radial bead (14) has a sealing surface (15) extending 
approximately parallel to the longitudinal seal axis with its 

length widening in the axial direction to form a broadened 
sealing region,
 
wherein the annular gap (13) extends inclinedly from the 

sealing surface (15) of the inner radial bead (14) into the 
annular bead (12) whilst forming an acute-angled sealing lip 

(21) on the second, outer radial bead (18), and closes by an 
elastic deformation of the two adjoining radial beads (14, 

18) when the housing (4) is clamped, so that the inner radial 
bead (14) exerts an additional pressure on the acute-angled 

sealing lip (21) on the second, outer radial bead (18), and
 
the sealing member (8) has an annular, recessed middle region 

(9) which in the clamped condition of the housing (4) defines 
an annular hollow space (10) extending between the two inner 

radial beads (14).  
 
A sealing device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sealing lip (21) extends at an acute angle to form a 

front edge. 
A sealing device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that on the inner side of the seal the first radial bead 

(14) has an axial annular groove in the form of an undercut 
(16) which forms on the radial bead (14) an acute-angled 

sealing lip (17) directed inwardly of the seal. 
A sealing device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the sealing member (8) has a recessed transition region 

(11) bordering on the undercut (16) of the first radial bead 
(14). 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the front edge of the sealing lip (21) 

is displaced radially outwards with respect to the sealing 
surface (15) of the first radial bead (14). 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the second radial bead (18) has a first 

sealing surface (19) which is inclined in the axial direction 
and widens radially, and a second sealing surface (23) which 

adjoins the first sealing surface (19) and extends in the 
axial direction substantially with constant diameter as far 

as an outer terminal wall (7) of the housing (4). 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the sealing member (8) is designed to 

be split on one side or completely along an axial 
longitudinal plane, so that together with the housing (4) it 

may be placed around a conduit.  
 
A sealing device according to claim 7, characterized in 
that a plane of separation between the two radial beads (14, 

18) is angularly displaced in the circumferential direction. 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the housing (4) has a clamping means 

disposed on its outer periphery. 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the sealing member (8) is inserted in 

the housing (4) loosely or with a snug fit. 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that a friction-reducing agent is applied to 

the outer periphery of the sealing member (8) and/or the 
inner periphery of the housing (4). 
A sealing device according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the elastomeric material of the sealing 

member (8) is an EPDM rubber (ethylene-propylene-diene 
elastomer) or an NBR rubber (acrylonitrile-butadiene 

elastomer).
