<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved process for producing sodium perborate monohydrate by dehydration of sodium perborate tetrahydrate in a fluidised bed by heated air. According to the invention, contact surfaces are arranged within the fluidised bed, the total area of which contact surfaces constitutes 1 - 500 times the area of the gas distribution plate of the fluidised bed. The contact surfaces are expediently designed as heat exchangers, the surface temperature of which is adjusted to 90 to 110@C. The process leads to a sodium perborate monohydrate having particularly high resistance to abrasion; at the same time the energy requirement is lower than in known processes.

Process for the production of sodium perborate 
monohydrate by dehydration of sodium perborate 

tetrahydrate in a fluidised bed by means of heated 
air, with the temperature of the air entering the 

fluidised bed being between 80 and 220°C and the 
temperature of the fluidised bed being between 40 and 

90°C,
 
characterised in that
 
contact surfaces whereof the total area constitutes 

from 1 to 500 times the area of the operating floor of 
the fluidised bed are arranged within the fluidised 

bed. 
Process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
flat contact surfaces whereof the total area 

constitutes from 2 to 100 times the area of the 
operating floor of the fluidised bed are used, which 

are positioned essentially vertically to the operating 
floor of the fluid bed. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the contact surfaces used are heat exchangers, 

preferably flat heat exchangers. 
Process according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that
 
a liquid heat-exchanging medium having an inlet 

temperature in the range of from 70 to 140°C is passed 
through the heat exchanger, with the inlet temperature 

and the flow rate of the heat-exchanging medium 
preferably being selected so that a temperature of 

from 90 to 110°C is established at the surface of the 
heat exchanger.  

 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the dehydration is carried out in a long, single-zone 

or multiple-zone fluidised bed dryer (fluidised bed 
channel) equipped with contact surfaces, preferably 

with one or more flat heat exchangers, with sodium 
perborate tetrahydrate being fed continuously at one 

end of the dryer and sodium perborate monohydrate 
being withdrawn at the other end. 
Process according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that
 
no contact surfaces are provided in the region of the 

point where sodium perborate tetrahydrate is fed into 
the fluidised bed, nor in zones wherein the sodium 

perborate tetrahydrate fed in as yet has no covering 
layer of sodium perborate monohydrate. 
Process according to claim 5 or 6,
 
characterised in that
 
a liquid heat-exchanging medium is supplied, in a 

direction countercurrent to the flow of the perborate 
to be dehydrated, to the heat exchanger(s) arranged in 

at least one zone of the fluidised bed channel and the 
temperature of the surface of the heat exchanger(s) 

is maintained preferably in the range of from 90 to 
110°C. 
Process according to one of claims 5 to 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the dehydration is carried out in an at least two-zone, 

channel-shaped fluidised bed dryer equipped with 
at least one flat heat exchanger, the plates whereof 

are aligned essentially vertically to the operating 
floor of the fluidised bed and parallel to the 

longitudinal direction of the channel, with drying air 
being supplied to the first zone, which preferably  

 
contains no contact surfaces, at an inlet temperature 

of from 100 to 140°C and with dry air being supplied 
to the following zone(s) at an inlet temperature of 

from 140 to 190°C.
