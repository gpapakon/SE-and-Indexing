consisting of one of plural liquid crystal cells and a 
voltage signal input means electrically connected with the 

liquid crystal element, wherein each liquid crystal cell 
contains a chiral smectic liquid crystal material layer and

element, the polarization direction of a light transmitted 

by the liquid crystal element is changed by approx. 90° as 
compared with the state where the voltage signal is not 

input to the liquid crystal element enables a change of a 
light path and an open-close (on-off) operation of a light 

path at a high speed (optical switching time: not longer

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
light modulation device, and more particularly to a light
modulation device which is preferable to an optical
switching device for use of a high-speed change of a light
path (a light path way) and to an optical shutter for use
of a high-speed open-close (on-off) operation of a light
path.In fields of optical communication art, stereoscopic
image display art, etc., light modulation devices capable
of realizing a high-speed change of a light path and a
high-speed open-close (on-off) operation of a light path
have been desired.The technical background of a light modulation device
of the present invention for use in the field of optical
communication art is described below.In the field of optical communication art, optical
switching devices are used for on-off of optical signals
transmitted on the optical transmission line such as an
optical fiber or a thin film optical waveguide, or used for
a change of the optical transmission direction. Conventionally used in the field of optical
communication art is a mechanical optical switching system,
for example, a system wherein an optical fiber is
mechanically moved to change its connecting portion to
other optical fiber or a system wherein an optical member
such as a prism, a mirror or a lens is moved to change the
light path.In the mechanical optical switching system, however,
the switching time is slow, e.g., several msec
(millisecond), and moreover there is involved a problem of
wearing properties in the driving part, and hence the
switching device is deteriorated in the reliability.On that account, a non-mechanical optical switching
system wherein the optical path is changed by utilizing
electrooptic (EO) effect, acoustooptic (AO) effect,
magnetooptic (MO) effect, etc. has been recently proposed
in place of the above-mentioned mechanical optical
switching system.As the non-mechanical optical switching system, there
can be mentioned, for example, an optical switching system
utilizing the EO effect of a nematic liquid crystal
material as described in R.E. Wagner & J.Cheng, "Applied
Physics", Vol. 19, 2921 (1980).In Figs. 16a and 16b, a liquid crystal optical
switching device (1') proposed by R.E. Wagner is shown, and
the optical switching device of Fig. 16a and the optical 
switching device of Fig. 16b are different from each other
in the output direction of a light (2).In the liquid crystal optical switching device (1'),
both of a polarization beam splitter (31, 31) and a total
reflection mirror (3, 3) are
