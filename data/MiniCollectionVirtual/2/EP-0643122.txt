<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns apparatus for separating catalyst particles in the 
catalytic cracking of reacted hydrocarbons, comprising an unconfined cyclone device 

made up of a diplegless cyclone (4) opening directly into a large volume separator 
vessel (21), below by means of a mouth (19) and above by means of the annular space 

between concentric pipes (6,7; 30,31; 40,41; 26, 27) to the other components of the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for separating solids from gas and to a
process for the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks, whether or not high
boiling point hydrocarbons are added.More particularly the invention is of apparatus used to separate, from a reacted
hydrocarbon mixture, particles from a catalyst suspension in a catalytic cracking
process. The novel and revolutionary idea of the apparatus enables the gas phase of
particulate suspensions to be separated out more efficiently.The invention also relates to the operation of such an apparatus as well as to
a new fluid catalytic cracking process (FCC) springing therefrom.In the fluid catalytic cracking process (FCC) the purpose is to convert high
boiling point hydrocarbons into light hydrocarbon fractions such as liquified petroleum
gas.The catalyst used in FCC is a very fine powder, particles of which act like a
liquid when fluidised in steam or air. The fluidised FCC catalyst circulates continuously
between the reaction and regeneration zones. In the first of these, together with
the cracking reactions, a carbonaceous deposit (coke) is created on the surface of the
catalyst, reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Removal of such deposit
takes place in the second zone, by its being burnt in air, the activity and selectivity the
of catalyst becoming high again. The catalyst also acts as a medium for the transfer
of heat from the regenerating to the reacting zone.Upon introduction of catalytic cracking catalysts containing zeolites,
particularly the ultra-stable zeolites, together with the use of high reaction temperatures
and cracking with a short residence time in a riser reactor, fresh areas were found in
which to develop the technique so as to enable advantage to be taken of the high activity
and selectivity of such zeolitic catalysts.The usual technique consists of feeding the catalyst mixture, as a warm
suspension, together with the sprayed hydrocarbon droplets into a riser where cracking 
reactions take place. Residence time for the reacting mixture is from 0.5 to 8 seconds
in reaction temperatures of over 485 degrees Celsius.As mentioned, along with such cracking reactions, a harmful carbonaceous
deposit (coke) develops on the surface of the catalyst which leads to a drop in activity
and selectivity.After the riser it is particularly advisable that coked catalyst particles be swiftly
separated from the cracked hydrocarbon suspension, in order to avoid any lengthy
contact of gas and particle phases which would
