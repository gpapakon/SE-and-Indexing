<DESCRIPTION>
 Description LIQUID CRYSTALLight-Modulating MaterialsTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to liquid crystal light control technology and, more specifically, to the manufacture of new liquid crystal materials comprising a light modulating dispersion of liquid crystal micro- droplets spontaneously formed and retained in synthetic polymeric matrix, e.g. for use in displays. Background ArtRecent developments in commercial fabrication of liquid crystal display devices have been directed toward materials which display images by exploiting the light scattering properties of liquid crystals that are incorporated variously into or onto a plastic sheet or the like, to avoid the sealing problems encountered in conventional cell-type displays. The display characteris- tics of these materials depend on the size and morphology of the entrapped liquid crystals. Characteristics such as scattering efficiency and switching time between ON and OFF states are affected by the diameter and density of the discrete quantities of liquid crystal. Proposed types of materials include materials con-, taining encapsulated liquid crystals, and materials with icropores into which liquid crystals are imbibed.One prior proposal for encapsulating liquid crystals is disclosed in French Patent No. 2,139,537 and involves forming an aqueous emulsion of ne atic or cholesteric liquid crystal material with an immiscible binder such a polyvinyl alcohol. The mixture is emulsified in a high speed blender or the like to form droplets of the liquid crystal that are encapsulated by the binder. The encapulated droplets are then coated onto a clear 

 plastic substrate having the usual conducting electrodes. A similar technique is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,435,047.Another prior proposal involving filling the open5 or connected icropores of a plastic sheet with a nematic or other type of liquid crystal is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,048,358.These prior art techniques involving the mechanical entrapment of liquid crystals have some drawbacks.Itf Encapsulation by emulsification can yield a relatively broad spectrum of capsule diameters which can necessitate size classifying. Entrapment by imbibing into microporous plastic presents the problem of sealing the micropores to prevent leakage of the liquid crystals.-"-5 Electrical manipulation of these light scattering devices between light scattering and light transmissive modes causes the devides, or imaging-forming segments thereof, to appear opaque in one state and transparent in another
