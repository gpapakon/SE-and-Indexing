<ABSTRACT>
A soft contact lens which comprises a water-swollen gel of a 
polymer prepared by polymerizing one or more hydrophilic monomers 

such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, one or more cross-linking 
monomers, and a monomer that contains metal-chelating functionality 

such as an aminopolycarboxylic acid that contains a polymerizable 
olefinic group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to metal-chelating, hydrogel polymers
that have anti-bacterial properties and which can be used in the
fabrication of soft contact lenses. The invention also relates to
a process for the preparation of soft contact lenses comprising said
metal-chelating polymers and to a process for the preparation of the
metal-chelating monomers that are employed in the production of said
polymers.The most serious adverse response associated with the use of
contact lenses is corneal ulceration. The risk of development of
such ulcers is particularly associated with the use of soft lenses
in an extended wear mode, that is, when the lens is worn continuously,
without removal during sleep. Such ulcers can lead to
perforation of the cornea, or can leave corneal scars which cause
permanent partial vision loss. The most threatening ulcers are
those caused by microbial agents such as Acanthamoeba or bacteria
such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus
pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The healthy eye uses a number of mechanisms to defend itself
from infection by pathogenic bacteria. Lysozyme, one of the
principal proteins found in tears, is known to kill common Gram
positive bacteria by hydrolyzing and dissolving parts of their
exterior membranes. Other proteinaceous tear components such as
complement proteins and immunoglobulins such as secretory IgA
contribute to this defense system. Lactoferrin is a tear protein
which is bacteriostatic by virtue of its ability to bind iron and 
thus make it unavailable to bacteria. Bacteria cannot
maintain sustained growth in the absence of iron. Also,
other trace metallic elements such as calcium, copper,
magnesium, molybdenum, and zinc are essential co-factors for
many bacterial enzymes such as proteinases. In many cases,
it is the action of such enzymes on tissue of the eye that
causes much of the damage during a bacterial infection of
the eye.This invention is based upon the discovery that soft
contact lenses can be prepared from polymers that contain
metal chelating functionality, and that such lenses have the
ability to chelate metals such as iron, calcium, copper,
magnesium, molybdenum, and zinc, and thus make such metals
unavailable to bacteria.The prior art includes Hedlund et al., U.S. Patent No.
