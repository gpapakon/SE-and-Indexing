Process for producing lightweight aggregates from 
heat-treated polystyrene foam particles, characterized in 

that these are subjected to a brief thermal shock from 
300°C to 800°C and above and that, after the heat-treatment 

of the particles, intermediate cooling is carried 
out to embrittle the surface, for example by means of a 

cold air stream or water, in particular a quenching 
treatment, and if desired a plurality of heat and cooling 

treatments are carried out alternately. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a container 

for accommodating the material to be sintered, the 
bottom and walls of the container comprising heat-resistant 

mesh, in that the container is arranged in an 
inclined position and, if desired, is provided with a 

shaking apparatus and in that nozzles are provided for 
blowing, preferably, hot air into the container and cold 

air nozzles are arranged at the material outlet. 
Process for producing lightweight concrete 
aggregates, characterized in that polystyrene foam 

particles, if desired pretreated according to Claim 1, 
are wetted in the mixing trough of a mechanical mixer 

with a mixture of water and water glass and, in the same 
mixing cycle, are subsequently admixed with such an 

amount of cement powder that the total amount of the 
wetting liquid is bound by cement powder.
