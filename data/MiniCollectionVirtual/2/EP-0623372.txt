of fibers arranged in substantially uniform orientation 

over at least a portion of their active length, along 
which portion at least, each of the fibers is disposed in 

close proximity to its adjacent fibers, and a body member 
(4) constituting a backing surface for the fibers. The 

cleaning system includes nozzle means (6) for applying at 
least one fluid jet (10) against the fibers, and means for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter element and
a system for cleaning the element. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a filter element comprising a
plurality of fibers of a substantially uniform orientation
disposed in close proximity to each other, and to fluid-emitting
nozzles means for cleaning said element.Fluid filters comprising threads in various
orientations are known. Fluid filters are also known
which consist of threads stretched between two members.The present invention is concerned with the manner of
cleaning such filters, since the common methods of forward
and back flushing have proved not to be very effective for
cleaning them. Moreover, experiments have shown that the
mere application of fluid jets against the fibers,
irrespective of the pressure applied, is not sufficiently
effective to pry loose the dirt which has adhered to the
fibers.The Applicant's earlier European Patent Application,
publication number EP-A-0,119,340 discloses a filter
element comprising:
a plurality of layers of fibers arranged in
substantially uniform orientation over at least a portion
of their active length, along which portion at least, each
of said fibers is disposed in close proximity to its
adjacent fibers;a body member constituting a backing surface for said
fibers;nozzle means for applying at least one fluid jet
against the fibers; and,means for applying a relative movement between said
fibre layers and said fluid jet.
This device operates with a single cleaning fluid.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
a filter method according to claim 1 is presented. According to a second aspect of the present invention,
a filter system according to claim 4 is presented. An example of the present invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
which:-
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view across a filter
element and a cleaning nozzle according to present
invention; and,Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view across a fluid
filter system incorporating a filter element and a cleaning
nozzle according to the present invention.Referring first to Figure 1, there is shown a fluid
filter element 1, comprising a plurality of layers 2
composed of fibers. The fibers are arranged to assume a 
substantially uniform orientation, wherein each of the
fibers is disposed in close proximity to its adjacent
fibers. The filter element further comprises a body member
4, constituting a backing surface for the fiber layers 2.
Body member 4 may have any suitable configuration;
