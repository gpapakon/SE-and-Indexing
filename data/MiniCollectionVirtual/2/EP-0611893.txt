<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bellows seal for pivot joints, preferably on motor vehicles, with a bellows (3) which surrounds the joint and which is arranged in a sealed manner on the joint housing (1), on the one hand, and on the pivot (2) on the other. In order to provide a bellows seal which does not produce additional turning moments in the joint and the bellows (3) of which is not twisted when the joint housing (1) and the pivot (2) are rotated relative to one another, a packing ring (4) is inserted with intermaterial engagement into at least one opening in the bellows (3), this ring being connected rotatably via a surface structure of labyrinth-like design, to a mating ring (5) which is fixed on the joint housing (1) or on the pivot (2).

<CLAIMS>
Bellows-type seal for pivot joints, preferably on motor 
vehicles, with a bellows which surrounds the joint and is 

disposed, in a sealed manner, on the joint housing on one 
hand and on the pivot on the other,
 
characterized in that
 
a sealing ring (4), which is connected, in a turnable 

manner via a surface structure of labyrinth-like 
construction, to a counter-ring (5) which is secured in 

position on the joint housing (1) or on the pivot (2), is 
inserted in a material-locking manner at least in one 

opening in the bellows (3). 
Bellows-type seal according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the labyrinth-like surface structure between the 

sealing ring (4) and the counter-ring (5) is constituted 
by annular depressions (8) and/or elevations (9). 
Bellows-type seal according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the annular depressions (8) and/or elevations (9) 

may be constructed both on a face (6) located in a radial 
plane and also on an adjoining cylindrical superficies 

(7). 
Bellows-type seal according to at least one of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the sealing ring (4) and 

counter-ring (5) are connected to one another, by a snap 
connection, so as to be non-losable but capable of 

turning relative to one another. 
Bellows-type seal according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the snap connection is constituted by an annular 

bead (10) which engages behind the other component (4) or 
(5) in each case.  

 
Bellows-type seal according to at least one of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the sealing ring (4) is 

vulcanized into a recess (3b) constructed in an opening 
in the bellows (3). 
Bellows-type seal according to at least one of claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the sealing ring (4) is 

disposed in the opening (3a) in the bellows (3) at the 
pivot end. 
Bellows-type seal according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the counter-ring (5) is secured in position, in a 

force-locking manner, on the pivot (2). 
Bellows-type seal according to claim 7 or 8,
 
characterized in that that edge (3c) of the bellows 

opening (3a) which surrounds the sealing ring (4) 
projects above the sealing ring (4) and the counter-ring 

(5) in the axial direction. 
Bellows-type seal according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the edge (3c) of the bellows opening (3a) is 

constructed with sealing lips (3d) at the end face. 
Bellows-type seal according to at least one of claims 1 
to 10, characterized in that the sealing ring (4) and the 

counter-ring (5) are manufactured from polyamide.
