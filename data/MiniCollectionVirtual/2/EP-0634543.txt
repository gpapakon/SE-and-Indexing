A combination lock (1) with a rotating knob (3), a 
cam disc (4) and a lever (5) hinged to a bolt (2), 

when an opening combination of the lock (1) is 
correctly selected said lever (5) engaging, in 

particular by means of a hook-like projection (6), 
with an opening (7) of the cam disc (4), so that 

turning of the cam disc (4) pulls back the bolt (2) 
by means of the lever (5), whereby the rotating knob 

(3) is provided for setting individual values of the 
opening combination at different angles of rotation 

and, at each setting of a value can, in addition to 
its ability to rotate, also be displaced axially to 

operate an electric switch (11) assigned to the value 
in question, so that by way of the switches (11) 

assigned to the individual setting values the latter 
can be supplied electrically to a memory that 

contains the relevant opening combination and 
controls an electric motor (12) arranged in the 

interior of a sliding bar (13) in such a way that, 
when the opening combination is correctly selected, a 

coupling member (14) carried by the sliding bar (13) 
is moved into the region of a first working surface 

(15) of one cam of the cam disc (4), so that the 
turning of the cam disc (4) operates said sliding 

bar, which, for its part, acts upon a lever arm (18) 
of the lever (5) and swivels said lever into the 

engaging position, whereby the position of the first 
working surface (15) and the opening (7) are adapted 

to each other in such a way that the displacement of  
 

the sliding bar (13) and the swivelling of the lever 
(5) are completed at approximately the same time, 


characterized in that
 the sliding bar (13) has a 
projection (20) which faces the cam disc (4) and 

which, when the cam disc (4) is turned back in order 
to close the bolt (2), is contacted by a second 

working surface (21) of the cam disc (4), so that the 
sliding bar (13) is forced to move back to its 

original position as a result of the turning of the 
cam disc (4) when the lock (1) is being closed. 
A combination lock as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the first working surface (15) 

and the second working surface (21) are arranged one 
behind the other on the cam disc (4). 
A combination lock as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the sliding bar (13) is 

displaceable against the force of a restoring spring 
(22) as the lever (5) swivels into the cam disc (4). 
A combination lock as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that the 'force of the restoring 

spring (22) for the sliding bar (13) is selected to 
be of such a magnitude as to at least assist the 

displacement of the sliding bar (13) into its 
original position. 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the lever arm (18) 

provided on the lever (5) for swivelling the same 
into the coupling position has a projecting pin (25) 

which is displaceable against a pressure spring (24) 
and with the free projecting end (26) thereof engages 

with a recess (27) in the sliding bar (13) and, at  
 

least in an open position of the lever (5) runs 
slantwise in the sense that its end (26) acting on 

the sliding bar (13) points somewhat against the 
direction of displacement during opening, and that 

during displacement of the sliding bar (13) said pin 
is adjustable in the lever arm (18) against the 

pressure spring (24) in order to compensate for 

difference in travel between the arc described by the 
lever arm (18) and pin (25) and a contrasting 

straight movement of the sliding bar (13). 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the recess (27) which is 

provided in the sliding bar (13) and which receives 
the free end (26) of the pin (25) is restricted on 

both sides of the pin (25). 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the lever (5) is provided 

with an opening (29) receiving the pin (25) and the 
pressure spring (24) for the pin (25), said opening 

having at least in some regions a polygonal cross 
section, for example a tetragonal cross section, 

particularly a square cross section, and that one or 
both ends (24a) of the pressure spring (24) run(s) 

parallel to a wall (29a) of the opening (29) up to 
the adjacent wall (29b) angularly disposed in 

relation thereto and/or at least the end windings of 
the pressure spring (24) are configured in a 

polygonal or tetragonal fashion, so that the opening 
(29) encloses the ends (24a) of the pressure spring 

(24) or the polygonal windings in a manner that 
provides a form-fit and a safeguard against turning.  

 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that the windings of the 

pressure spring (24) are wound in a tetragonal 
fashion over their entire lengths. 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that the pin (25) bearing 

against the pressure spring (24) in the interior of 
the lever (5) has a continuation (30) that fits 

inside of the pressure spring (24) and is shorter 
than the spring (24) by at least the length of spring 

travel when compressed. 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that the pin (25) has a 

tetragonal, particularly a square cross section 
corresponding to the opening (29) and that the pin 

end (26) co-operating with the sliding bar (13) is 
rounded off, whereby the centre or axis of curvature 

of this rounding off runs approximately parallel to 
the swivel axis (19) of the lever (5), and that the 

rounded-off area of the pin (25) lies with line 
contact against areas of the recess (27) that overlap 

it in a sliding direction. 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the cam disc 

(4) has at its circumference in a region adjacent to 
the opening (7) a sliding curve (32), and the bolt 

(2) has a projecting thrust surface (33) to cooperate 
with said sliding curve (32) when the bolt 

(2) is being pushed into its closed position. 
A combination lock as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the coupling  

 
member (14) is a turnable lever arresting the sliding 

bar (13) in its original position.
