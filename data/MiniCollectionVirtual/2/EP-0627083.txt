Methods and apparatus for electronically displaying metered electrical energy are disclosed. A first processor (14) receives voltage and current signals and determines electrical energy. The first processor (14) generates an energy signal representative of the electrical energy determination. A second processor (16), connected to said first processor, receives the energy signal and generates a display signal representative of electrical energy information. A display (30) is connected to receive the display signal and displays the electrical energy information. In a first embodiment it is preferred for the first processor (14) to determine units of electrical energy from the voltage and current signals and to generate an energy signal representative of the determination of such units and the rate at which the units are determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for displaying metered electrical energy.Techniques and devices for metering the various
forms of electrical energy are well known. Meters, such as
utility power meters, can be of two types, namely, electro-mechanical
based meters whose output is generated by a
rotating disk and electronic based meters whose output
component is generated electronically. A hybrid meter also
exists, wherein an electronic register for providing an
electronically generated display of metered electrical energy
has been combined, usually optically, to a rotating disk.
Pulses generated by the rotating disk, for example by light
reflected from a spot painted on the disk, are utilized to
generate an electronic output signal.It will be appreciated that electronic meters have
gained considerable acceptance due to their increasing
reliability and extended ambient temperature ranges of
operation. Consequently, various forms of electronic based
meters have been proposed which are virtually free of any
moving parts. In the last ten years several meters have been
proposed which include a microprocessor.Testing of electronic meters has always been a
problem. A special mode of register operation known in the
industry as the test mode has been available to ease register 
testing, however, little has been done to improve
overall meter testing. Electronic meters have the
potential of providing faster test times, multiple
metering functions and calibration of the meter through
software adjustment. However, implementing such
functions can be expensive and complicated.Presently, electric utility companies can test
mechanical meters with a piece of test equipment which
can reflect light off a metered disk to detect a painted
spot as the disk rotates. An alternative form of testing
mechanical meters is disclosed in U.S. Patent Number
4,600,881 which describes the formation of a hole in the
disk. A light sensitive device is placed in a fixed
position on one side of the disk. As the disk rotates,
and the hole passes over the light sensitive device, a
pulse is provided indicating disk movement.Since electronic meters preferably do not contain
rotating disks, such simple testing techniques cannot be
used.US Patent Specification 4,884,021, corresponding to the
pre-characterising part of claim 1, discloses an energy
meter comprising a first processor for generating pulsed
energy signals and a second processor responsive to the
energy signals for driving a display. However, the
specification is
