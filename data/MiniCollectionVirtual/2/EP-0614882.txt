<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride by chlorinating 

D-(-)-phenylglycine hydrochloride, which as such is 
prepared in situ from D-(-)-phenylglycine and hydrochloric 

acid gas, in a solvent. According to the invention chlorination 
of the hydrochloride is carried out in a non-chlorinated 

solvent or a mixture of non-chlorinated solvents in the presence 
of a reaction promoting medium. 
 
Chlorination is carried out through the addition of 
PCl₅, but preferably the PCl₅ is prepared in situ from PCl₃ and 

Cl₂ gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation
of D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride by chlorinating
in a heterogeneous system D-(-)-phenylglycine hydrochloride, which is as such, prepared
in situ from D-(-)-phenylglycine and hydrochloric acid
gas, in a solvent.D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride is a particularly
valuable substance; after all, this substance is
used in the preparation of antibiotics. D-(-)-phenylglycine
chloride hydrochloride is an indispensable starting material
in the preparation of the half-synthetic penicillins, such as
ampicillin; the half-synthetic cephalosporin, cefalhexin; and
bactericides such as tetrazolylpenams and spiropenams.As is known, D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride
is prepared by chlorinating D-(-)-phenylglycine hydrochloride
with phosphorus pentachloride in a solvent which does not
dissolve the starting product and the end product and whereby
phosphorus oxychloride is obtained as a by-product. Separation
by filtration yields a non-dividable mixture of D-(-)-phenylglycine
chloride hydrochloride and the non-reacted starting
substance. As D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride is
used in the preparation of medicines, it must be of the
highest possible purity. Nowadays it is a requirement that the
content of D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride in the
end-product is 96% or more.In order to meet this requirement it is necessary in
the known methods to carry out the chlorination in chlorinated
solvents such as: dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane,
carbon tetrachloride or mixtures of such chlorinated solvents.
It is generally known that this type of chlorinated solvents
is very harmful. For humans they are toxic and some of them
are even carcinogenic. For the environment they are very harmful
because they are not biologically degradable. These adverse
characteristics cause various problems when using the
above-mentioned chlorinated solvents in the preparation of D-(-)-phenylglycine
chloride hydrochloride. From a hygienic and
safety point of view the treatment of the process solution is 
obstructed. The losses during the working up of the process
solution have a destructive effect on the environment, and the
volatility of these solvents aggravates the problem even more.
There are also disadvantages with a view to the end-product,
as there is always a small but not removable amount of solvent
remaining in the dried D-(-)-phenylglycine chloride hydrochloride.
As this product is used in the preparation of medicines
it is not
