<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a magnetic sensor with magnetoresistive effect comprising an element with magnetoresistive effect (2) the resistance of which varies as a function of the magnetic field applied and two pole pieces (4, 5) making it possible to collect the magnetic field to be detected in such a way as to concentrate it in the element with magnetoresistive effect (2), each pole piece being positioned in such a way as partially to cover over the magnetoresistive element (2), the said element with magnetoresistive effect being traversed by a current I, characterised in that the regions of the element with magnetoresistive effect (2) which are covered with the pole pieces are cut out in such a way that the current which passes through the element with magnetoresistive effect is localised in a region which lies in the gap situated between the two pole pieces.

<CLAIMS>
Magnetic sensor with magneto-resistive effect, comprising an element with
magneto-resistive effect (2), the resistance of which varies as a function of the

applied magnetic field, and two pole pieces (4, 5) enabling collection of the
magnetic field to be detected so as to concentrate it in the magneto-resistive

element (2), each pole piece being positioned so as to partly overlap the
magneto-resistive element (2), said element with magneto-resistive effect being

passed through by a current I, 
characterized in that
 the zones of the element with
magneto-resistive effect (2) which are overlapped by the pole pieces are cut into

so that the current which passes through the magneto-resistive element is
localized in a zone located in the air gap between the two pole pieces.
Magnetic sensor according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said zones consist of
a succession of castellations (6).
Magnetic sensor according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the castellations (6)
and the spacing separating two castellations have the same width (L).
Magnetic sensor according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the element with magneto-resistive effect (2) is made of a single material.
Magnetic sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
element with magneto-resistive effect (2) is made by stacking at least two

magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer.
