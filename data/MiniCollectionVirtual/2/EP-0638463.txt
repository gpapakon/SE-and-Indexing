Sealing device (1) of the type comprising 
an element (2) for fixing to a support (T) of the frame 

or the body of a motor vehicle and a sealing element (3) 
with which a movable part of the vehicle can cooperate, 

the said fixing element (2) incorporating a metallic 
armatur
e (10) and being a clip shape with a U-shaped 
cross section defining two wings (5,6) facing each other 

and a back (8), said metallic armature (10) being arched 
and embedded in the back (8) while being asymmetrically 

disposed with respect to the central plane separating the 
two wings (5,6) of the fixing element (2), characterized 

in that the presence of the metallic armature (10) is 
confined to the back (8) of the fixing element (2). 
Sealing device according to claim 1, 
in which the sealing element (3), such as a tubular 

profiled element, is adjacent to one of the two wings or 
inner wing (5) of the sealing device, characterized in 

that the said inner wing (5) is substantially completely 
located on one side with respect to the longitudinal 

plane of symmetry of the said armature (10). 
Sealing device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the back (8) and the two 

wings (5,6) of the fixing element (2) are produced in a 
hard rubber. 
Sealing device according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that in an arching operation of 

the said device, the part to be arched is heated, then 
deformed and tempered in water to keep the shape given 

after arching.
