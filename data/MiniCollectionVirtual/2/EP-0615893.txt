<ABSTRACT>
A one-piece steering knuckle assembly (10) for heavy commercial 
vehicles such as trucks has a flanged body (11) wherein the tie rod arm 

(16) and in some instances the steering arm (14) extend from the flanged 
body (11) in a one-piece manner. The flanged body (11) is constructed 

and arranged to receive a brake assembly thereon and the wheel spindle 
(12) extends from the flanged body (11) also in a unitary manner. In a 

preferred manner, the steering or the tie rod arms (14,16) are forged to 
the flanged body (11) through enlarged bosses (27,28) which provide for 

connection to an axle (18) by a king pin (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steering knuckle assembly
for vehicles. More particularly, it relates to a one-piece
steering knuckle assembly for heavy commercial
vehicles such as trucks wherein the tie rod arm as well
as a brake flange with or without a steering arm are
forged together.The English language abstract of JP-A-60-138049
dicloses a one-piece steering knuckle assembly for
trucks. The known knuckle is provided with a main body
carrying the wheel spindle at one side and bosses at the
opposite side of the main body. The bosses are provided
to receive a king pin within appropriate bores. A
steering arm and a tie rod arm are extending from
bosses which tie rod arm is straight. The root of the tie
rod arm is located at a position of the circumference of
the boss which is shifted from a position opposite to the
main body towards the main body itself. As a consequence
the known one-piece knuckle has a reentrant
contour which only allows for casting of the knuckle.In the prior art it is known to provide a steering
knuckle for bearing lubrication with tie rods which are
fastened to the knuckle. This is provided in U.S. Patent
1,755,627. It is also known in the prior art to provide an
integral spindle arm with a steering knuckle for suspension
purposes as well as to provide an integral brake
flange for attachment to a brake backing plate. This is
described in U.S. Patent 2,556,767.There is commonly available a steering knuckle for
heavy duty motor vehicles such as trucks wherein the
steering arm and the tie rod arm are fitted to a steering
knuckle by means of a threaded portion and a fastening
nut. These heavy duty steering knuckles also employ a
flanged body to which is separately attached a brake
spider unit for connection to a brake drum assembly.There is a need in the heavy duty motor vehicle
field to provide a steering knuckle assembly wherein the
tie rod arm is integrally formed as a one-piece unit with
the steering knuckle with or without a steering arm. This
is accomplished by the present invention.The invention provides a one-piece steering
knuckle assembly for heavy commercial vehicles such
as trucks or the like wherein a flanged body is constructed
and arranged to receive a brake assembly. A
wheel spindle extends from the flanged body. A tie rod
arm is connected to the flanged body in a one-piece
manner. There are enlarged bosses extending from the
flanged body opposite the wheel spindle, the bosses
having a bore which are axially aligned to receive a king
pin. The flanged body, wheel spindle,
