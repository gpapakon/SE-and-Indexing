<ABSTRACT>
A soldering flux comprising a bis (2-oxazoline) 
compound, a dithiol compound, an organic carboxylic 

acid compound and an activator which does not require 
post-soldering cleaning and, yet, does not cause 

corrosion of the base metal or deterioration of 
electrical characteristics and helps to clear the 

statutory regulations on the use of chlorofluorohydrocarbons. 
A soldering flux comprising, in addition to the 
above components, an organic solvent, a thermoplastic 

resin or/and an epoxy group-containing compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a soldering flux. The great majority of soldering fluxes heretofore 
available comprise a rosin or rosin-modified resin 
supplemented with an activator consisting of an organic 
acid and a hydrohalic acid salt. However, these fluxes leave residues on the substrate 
surface after completion of the soldering 
operation and may cause cracks on cyclic heating and 
cooling and tends to give faulse "rejects" in the in-circuit 
test because of the failure of the contactor 
pin to penetrate down to the printed circuit of the 
board. Furthermore, on moisture absorption and 
temperature gain, these residues tend to cause 
corrosion of the base metal and deterioration of the 
electrical characteristics of printed circuit boards. Therefore, it is common practice to perform 
cleaning with a chlorofluorohydrocarbon to remove 
residues of the flux after the soldering operation. However, since the cleaning agent 
chlorofluorohydrocarbons are under rigorous 
environmental control today, cleaning with them is now 
a virtually forbidden procedure. The object of this invention is to provide a 
soldering flux free of the above-mentioned problems, 
that is to say a flux not requiring post-soldering 
cleaning and yet withstanding cyclic heating and 
cooling, being compatible with the in-circuit test, 
with minimum risks of base metal corrosion due to 
elevation of temperature and humidity and of the aging 
of electrical characteristics and conforming to the 
statutory regulations over the use of chlorofluorohydrocarbons 
through omission of the cleaning  
 
operation. This invention relates to a soldering flux 
comprising a bis(2-oxazoline) compound, a dithiol 
compound, an organic carboxylic acid compound and an 
activator. The bis(2-oxazoline) compound for use in this 
invention can be represented by the general formula 
wherein R₀ represents a carbon-to-carbon bond or a 
divalent hydrocarbon residue; R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ 
independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group 
or an aryl group. Where R₀ is a hydrocarbon residue, 
it may be an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group or 
an arylene group. Where R₀ represents a carbon-to-carbon 
bond, the bis(2-oxazoline) compound may for 
example be 2,2'-bis(2-oxazoline), 2,2'-bis(4-methyl-2-oxazoline), 
2,2'-bis(5-methyl-2-oxazoline), 2,2'-bis(5,5'-dimethyl-2-oxazoline), 
2,2'-bis(4,4,4',4'-tetramethyl-2-oxazoline) 
or the like. Where R₀ 
represents an alkylene group, the bis(2-oxazoline) 
compound includes 1,2-bis(2-oxazolin-2-yl)ethane,
