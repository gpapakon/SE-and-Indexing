<ABSTRACT>
A combined scanning hear field optical and atomic force microscope 
(NSOM/AFM) capable of measuring the topography and the 

optical characteristics of the surface of a sample (37) at high 
resolution irrespective of the transmittance and the 

conductivity of the sample is described. The apparatus, in one 
embodiment, comprises 

a probe (4), a light source for illuminating a sample with light (34), a 
photoelectric converter device (38) and optics for receiving light 

transmitted through the sample, 
a laser (30) for detecting deflections of the 

probe, a condenser lens (31) for directing the laser light on to the 
rear surface of the probe, a detection system for detecting 

reflected light (32,33), a rough-motion mechanism (39) and a fine-motion 
mechanism (40) for moving the sample and the probe relative to each 

other, a control means for controlling the distance between the 
sample and the probe, and a computer (42) for controlling the whole 

apparatus. The probe, comprising a cladded single mode optical fibre, 
has a front end portion and a light-propagating 

body continuous with the front end portion. The 
front end portion and the light-propagating body are shaped like 

a hook. Methods for manufacturing the probe are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a probe for scanning near-field optic/atomic
force microscope for observing the topography of a substance to be investigated,
by making use of an atomic force acting between substances, and at the same
time for observing the optical property of a microscopic region of the
investigated substance by a probe consisting of a light-propagating body. Such
a probe according to the preamble of claim 1 is for example known from
"Review of Scientfic Instruments", Sept. 1992, USA, vol. 63, No. 9, pages 4061-4065,
Shalom et al.Atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are capable of accurately observing the
topography of the surface of a sample, irrespective of whether the sample is
conductive or not, in contrast with scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs)
and, therefore, AFMs are widespread. Atomic force microscopy is a measuring
method utilizing the fact that a spring element supporting a measuring probe
is deflected by an atomic force acting between a sample and the measuring
probe.In an attempt to measure the optical characteristics and the topography of a
sample, a probe consisting of a light transmissive medium having a sharp front
end was brought close to the sample to be investigated such that the distance
between them was less than the wavelength of the light. Also, some close-field
optical microscopes have been proposed. In one of 
these proposed optical microscopes, laser light is directed from
the rear side of a sample such that the light is totally
reflected by the rear surface of the sample. Evanescent light
leaking from the front surface of the sample is detected by
bringing the front end of an optical fiber probe close to the
surface of the sample, the probe being equipped with a fine-motion
mechanism. The topography of the surface is observed in
the way that the probe is scanning horizontally and vertically
so as to detect constant evanescent light, or the probe is
scanning horizontally so as to measure variations in the
intensity of the evanescent light.In another proposed apparatus, the front end of an optical
fiber probe is held vertical to a sample. The front end is
vibrated horizontally over the surface of the sample to produce
friction between the sample surface and the front end of the
probe, thus resulting in vibrations. Variations in the
amplitude of the vibrations are detected as deviations of the
optical axis of laser light which is emitted from the front end
of the optical fiber and transmitted through the sample. A
fine-motion mechanism is actuated to move the
