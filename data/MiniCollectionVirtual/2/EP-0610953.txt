<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to partially to fully foamed articles and a process
using supercritical fluids for making the same.Foamed polymers are used in a wide variety of structural applications
when weight savings are desired, but as is often the case, foam strength is often
sacrificed as the density is reduced. This may be due to the size of the cells
resulting from the foaming process.The preparation of a polymeric foam typically involves (1) the formation
of gas bubbles in a liquid system, (2) the growth of these bubbles to form cells,
and (3) the stabilization of the cells by viscosity increase and/or solidification of
the foamed media. There are two major classifications of methods for foam
production, (1) chemical methods and (2) physical methods.In the chemical method, a gas phase may be obtained using a gas in
liquid polymer phase. The gas is typically dispersed within the liquid polymer
phase. The gas may be obtained either as a by-product of a polymerization
reaction, or generated by thermal decomposition of an added compound
(blowing agent) to the polymer phase. Since chemical methods are applicable
only over a limited temperature range, the viscosity of the polymer determines
the resultant cellular structure. There are several commonly known physical methods of producing
foams. In one method, air, N2 or other gas is dispersed into a polymeric
starting material at a high pressure and a temperature below the glass transition
temperature. When the pressure is released, a supersaturated specimen is
produced. When this specimen is then heated to the glass transition
temperature, a large number of bubbles nucleate. In the second method, low-boiling
liquids (blowing agents), such as chlorofluorocarbons or hydrocarbons
are dispersed into the polymeric starting material. The mixture is then heated
and the blowing agent is volatilized, thereby forming cells in the polymeric
starting material. The viscosity using a physical method is controlled by the
temperature at which foaming is to occur.These conventional processes, both chemical and physical methods,
employ the use of chemical blowing agents, or gases for producing a foamed
article. The type of foaming process used is generally dictated by the class of
polymeric starting material and the desired density or cell size. Such processes
may also incorporate the use of adjuvants, such as co-solvents, co-blowing
agents, nucleating agents, and/or plasticizers to aid and assist in the nucleation
of bubbles. Typically, plasticizers are added for nucleating

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing low density cellular foamed thermoplastic articles
wherein the densities and cell sizes of the foamed article can be controlled and

wherein the foam densities are greater than 0.03 grams per cubic centimeters,
cell sizes are in the range of 10 to 300 micrometers, and cell wall thicknesses

are greater than 0.1 micrometers but less than 2 micrometers, said process
comprising the steps of:


(1) charging a pressure vessel with a solid thermoplastic polymer optionally
containing an additive;
(2) heating with an external heat source the pressure vessel containing the solid
thermoplastic polymer and optionally an additive to a predetermined saturation

temperature to provide a softened thermoplastic polymer,

wherein the saturation temperature is within a range of temperatures which is
defined by the temperature range of a U-shaped curve "Density vs.

Temperature" at a fixed pressure which shows two temperatures at which
foams having the same density are obtained wherein the cell sizes of said

foams are different,

wherein the U-shaped curve is obtained by plotting an initial saturation
temperature which is slightly above the glass transition temperature or the

Vicat temperature (as determined by ASTM D 1529-91) of the thermoplastic
polymer material versus the density of the resulting foam (as determined by

ASTM D 792-86 with the proviso that the samples were not temperature
conditioned for 40 hours prior to the density determination, and the humidity

conditions were not maintained at 50%) and repeating this process with
incremental changes above and below the initial temperature;
(3) simultaneously charging a gas while heating the pressure vessel ; 
(4) equilibrating the pressure vessel, the softened thermoplastic polymer, and the
gas with the external heat source temperature;
(5) adjusting the pressure in the pressure vessel by adding additional gas to
achieve a final pressure wherein the gas is a supercritical fluid and soluble in

the softened thermoplastic polymer;
(6) saturating the softened thermoplastic polymer with the supercritical fluid for a
predetermined period of time; and
(7) venting the pressure vessel to rapidly depressurize the pressure vessel to foam
the thermoplastic polymer.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the gas is carbon dioxide, nitrous
oxide, ethylene, ethane, tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroethane,

tetrafluoromethane, trifluoromethane, or 1,1 -difluoroethylene.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the additive is a solvent.
