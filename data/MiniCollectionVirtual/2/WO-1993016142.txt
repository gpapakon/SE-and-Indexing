<DESCRIPTION>
 MOISTURE CURABLE POLYSILOXANE RELEASE COATINGCOMPOSITIONSField of the InventionThis invention relates to polysiloxane release coating compositions which cure rapidly and completely in atmospheric moisture in a controllable manner and which have a level of release which can easily be adjusted from premium to tight.10Background of the InventionIn the manufacture of many tape and label products in which a pressure sensitive adhesive is coated on a substrate such as paper or film, an essential component of the construction is the release coating. When a release15 coating is applied on the non-adhesive side of a backing, as in a roll of tape, it is commonly referred to as a "low adhesion backsize". The low adhesion backsize allows the roll of tape to be unwound with a reasonable amount of force (about 5 to 15 N/dm). On the other hand, a separate release coated sheet which is contacted with an adhesive coated side of a tape or label is referred to20 as a "liner", and in such a case, the peel force required to remove the tape or label is usually very low - typically less than about 1 to 2 N/dm. For this level of release, which is referred to as premium to easy, the usual coating material employed is some form of cured polysiloxane. These polysiloxanes are, for the most part, polydimethylsiloxanes substituted with a minimum number of25 various reactive functional groups. These polysiloxanes are coated on a substrate and subsequently chemically crosslinked. Ideally, these polysiloxanes should provide complete coverage of the substrate, cure completely to an ultra thin film (about 1 micron), have reasonable strength, be resistant to abrasion, and strongly adhere to the substrate. Other desirable features of such systems30 would include long term shelf stability and pot life prior to coating, followed by rapid cure on web, as well as the ability to easily adjust the release to higher levels than premium, if necessary. Few polysiloxane release coatings possess all of these optimal attributes. r. Over the years, a number of polysiloxane materials having35 different curing chemistries were developed as release liner coatings for <* pressure sensitive adhesives. One of the first to find widespread acceptance was a composition comprising high molecular weight silanol terminal polydimethylsiloxane and a low molecular weight crosslinking copolymer of 

dimethyl and methyl siloxane. Cure was effected by heating the composition in the presence of organometallic catalysts. Although reliable premium release was provided,
