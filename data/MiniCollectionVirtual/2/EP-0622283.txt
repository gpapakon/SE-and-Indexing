<ABSTRACT>
A traction control device (500) having means (100) for determining 
the speed of each of the left and right drive wheels of the 

vehicle; means (200) for determining the speeds of each of the 
left and right passive wheels of the vehicle; means (300) for 

calculating the actual slip rate of the drive wheels of the 
vehicle directly based on the measurements of the speeds for 

the drive and passive wheels; means (400) for establishing a 
target slip rate; and means (500) for controlling the driving 

condition of the vehicle by making the actual slip rate equal 
the target slip rate. The actual slip rate is matched to the 

target slip rate by controlling the engine output and the 

braking power. The step of controlling the driving condition 
of the vehicle by controlling the engine output and the 

braking power is carried out according to the time differential 
of the difference between the actual slip rate and the 

target slip rate at least until the actual slip rate matches 
the target slip rate for the first time. After the actual 

slip rate has matched the target slip rate at least once, the 
step of controlling is carried out according to the proportion 

of the difference between the actual and the target slip 
rates. Also disclosed is a method of controlling traction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traction control
device for a vehicle according to the preamble of claim 1
(DE-A-3 904 572) and to a traction control method according
to the preamble of claim 6 (DE-A-3 904 572) for accomplishing
the high responsiveness to the running condition
of the vehicle.The slip rate of a vehicle's wheels increases during
periods of acceleration when the drive wheels are driven with
excessive power. A traction control acts to prevent a decrease
in accelerating ability by determining the slip rate
of the drive wheels and controlling the engine output or the
braking power so that the slip rate does not exceed a prescribed
value.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (hereinafter
Kokai) No. Sho 62-137258, laid open to the public in 1987,
discloses an example of such a traction control device.The prior art traction control disclosed in the above
Japanese Kokai No. Sho 62-137258 has the problem that control
with good responsiveness is not necessarily achieved.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
propose a control device which makes it possible to achieve a
desired slip rate swiftly and with high responsiveness.It is another object of the present invention to
provide a traction control method which makes it possible to
achieve a desired slip rate swiftly and with high responsiveness.The above object is achieved according to the present
invention by providing a traction control device and
a traction control method with the features of claims 1
and 6, respectively. There does not necessarily have to be only one target
slip rate. A plurality of target slip rates may be established
such as an engine control slip rate for carrying out
the engine output control, and a breaking power target slip
rate for carrying out the brake system control. In the above
case, the braking power target slip rate may be set at a
larger value than the engine target slip rate in order to cut
down body vibration and to keep the frequency of use as low
as possible.A particular feature of the present invention is that
the control steps are carried out in order to match the
actual slip rate to the target slip rate, and, in order to
achieve this end, the brake force of the wheels is controlled
while the control method is being changed in response to the
driving condition of the vehicle.Control means are preferably provided so that the braking force of
each of the drive wheels is controlled identically at least
in the time period from when the control steps are initiated
until the difference between
