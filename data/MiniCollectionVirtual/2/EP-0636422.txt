<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for utilizing and controlling 
finer particles in a powder coating system (200) returns the finer 

particles to the spraying apparatus to be sprayed on parts by 
the system. Finer particles are continuously removed from the 

system by application onto parts (231), and the accumulation of 
fines is thereby prevented. The finer particles may be 

sprayed through specially adapted spray guns, which also 
permits the utilization of the special advantages of spraying 

fine pdwder materials. By removing fine powder particles from 
the system before they build up, the present invention 

improves the powder coating operation in various respects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder coating systems for
spraying air entrained solid particulate powder material from
powder spray guns onto workpieces within a powder spray booth
and particularly to a system for controlling and utilizing
the finer particulate powder material in any electrostatic
powder coating operation.Powder spray systems have been used for many years for
spraying air entrained solid particulate powder material from
electrostatic powder spray guns onto workpieces within a
powder coating booth. These systems conventionally collect
oversprayed material and re-use it. The recycling system
conventionally includes a fan for pulling the oversprayed
powder coating material from the powder coating booth into a
collector. The collector is comprised of a bank of cartridge
filters which separates substantially all of the powder from
the air and returns it to the spray guns, or a cyclone
recovery system which removes principally only the medium and
large powder particles from the air and returns those
particles to the spray guns. In a cyclone system, finer
particles which are not separated from the air in the cyclone
are trapped in a bank of downstream filter cartridges or
filter bags. These finer particles, or fines, are
normally scrapped.A typical powder coating used in these systems has
particles that range in size from submicron to 200 microns
(µ) Systems for spraying and recycling powder coating 
materials, particularly those which use cartridge filter
collectors as opposed to cyclone recovery systems, often
have problems associated with the buildup of excessive amounts
of fine particles or "fines." Fines are generally defined as
particles with a mean diameter of 10 µ or less. Fines can
also be defined in the relative sense as the smaller diameter
particles in any given particulate size distribution for a
sample of powder coating material.There are various theories concerning why fine powder
particles tend to build up in these systems. One theory is
that, when the particles are sprayed from the gun towards the
article to be coated, the heavier particles have greater
momentum and, therefore, tend to reach the article or the area
around the article more easily. The fine particles, on the
other hand, have less momentum, and, therefore, have more
difficulty breaking loose from the booth air currents.
Another belief is that coarser particles are more easily
charged than finer particles due to apparent greater attraction
of charging ions to the larger particles. The greater
charge on the larger
