<ABSTRACT>
A hardware is described in this paper named CARD COUPLER PLUG (CCP) 
which works between the CARD LEVEL ELEMENTS and the COUPLER 

LEVEL ELEMENTS. The function of a CCD is to allow to use different card 
types in a CARD MECHANIC (CM). The CCD serves automatically the right 

physical requirements to the specific card which occurs on the slot at the 
card mechanic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This description of the CCP relates to Integrated circuit(s) cards (IC-cards) 
and card terminals. IC-cards, terminals and communication standards 
between cards and terminals are described in the ISO 7816 for cards with 
contacts, in the ISO 10 536 for contactless cards and in the EN 726 for 
cards and terminals for telecommunications use. The goal of this patent description is:
 
To propose on the physical layer level a Card Coupler Plug CCP between 
the Specific Card Mechanic (SCM) at one side and the Card Interface Unit 
(CIU) at the other side in relation to the definitions of the ISO 7816 and the 
ISO 10536 standards (see Fig. 1). To make the international standards of different IC-cards workable in a 
single terminal is the main goal of this description. The goal of this patent is to describe a CARD COUPLER PLUG (CCP) 
which connects different cards to the application dependent terminal. 
Furthermore it is a goal that a card type which is indicated at the reader slot 
will be served by the right technical conditions of a CARD INTERFACE UNIT 
(CIU).  The standardisation of IC-cards has led to many results which are described 
in the papers of the ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC17, the papers of the CEN/TC224 and 
the ETSI papers. That means there could be IC-cards issued to the user which work by different 
physical principles like contact card and contactless cards. This different 
cards would not work compatible in a terminal. Especially the technical 
incompatibility of contact and contactless cards is a problem in the market. 
It is also a great problem for card component manufacturer to build up card 
independent components because there is not a standard connection base 
in the reader.  It is shown the Card Interface Unit (CIU) which transmits serial information 
between a host or a terminal and a Specific Card Mechanic (SCM). In the 
SCM could be inserted a Machine Readable Card (MRC). It is obvious that there has to be a direct physical connection which could 
establish a bi-directional signal flow for communication use between the 
MRC/SCM on the one hand and the CIU on the other. The fundamental assumption of the different standardisation papers 
(especially the ISO 7816) is that a description of the MRC-contacts on the 
one hand and a description of protocols on the other would determine 
compatibility between both sides. The remaining problem is to make sure 
that different CARDS and the CIU can be coupled by contacts in a predetermined 
manner in conformity with the standardisation. This figure shows
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A plug named CARD COUPLER PLUG which is characterised by its 
defined and predetermined wired 1 to 1 connection between CARD 

LEVEL ELEMENTS and COUPLER LEVEL ELEMENTS and which 
contains additional free pins named PLUG INDICATION PINs (PIPs) 

which are predetermined connected to a supply voltage if there has to be 
served on the card level side a specific card, whereby this first PIP of the 

CARD LEVEL side is predetermined connected to an equivalent second 
PIP on the COUPLER LEVEL side and whereby this second PIP 

signalises by its voltage level and input to an electronic named CARD 
INTERFACE UNIT (CIU) what a card type has to be served on the CARD 

LEVEL side. 
A CARD COUPLER PLUG (CCP) according to claim 1 which contains on 
the CARD LEVEL side additional a sensor for card-type-identification 

and 
which connects to the PIPs the right supply voltage in relation to the card 

which is indicated by the sensor.
