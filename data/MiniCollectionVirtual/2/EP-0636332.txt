<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric kettle comprising a plastic reservoir (1) and a heating means (3) which includes at least one electrical resistor (4) attached to a metal heating plate (5) mounted at the bottom of the reservoir (1) with its upper surface (5a) in direct contact with the liquid to be heated, which metal heating plate (5) is mounted on the reservoir (1) and is in direct thermal relationship with the walls (2) of the latter, and which electrical resistor (4) is of suitable power to enable the heating plate (5) alone to heat the liquid, the kettle being characterised in that: - the heating means (3) also includes a heat-diffusing plate (10) fastened on the one hand to the underside (5b) of the heating plate (5) and on the other hand to the electrical resistor (4).

An electric kettle comprising a reservoir (1) of
plastic material and a heating means (3) including at

least one electric resistance (4) associated with a
metal heating plate (5) mounted at the bottom of the

reservoir (1), the reservoir (1) comprising walls (2)
of plastic material which are in contact with a liquid

for heating contained in the reservoir while the metal
heating plate (5), being mounted on the plastic

reservoir, is in direct contact by its upper surface
(5a) with the liquid for heating and is in direct

thermal relation via a peripheral zone (6) with the
walls (2) of the said reservoir, the electric

resistance (4) being of a power adapted to allow the
metal heating plate (5) itself on its own to ensure

heating of the liquid, the structure of the heating
means (3) being so arranged that there is no risk of

degradation of the plastic material of the walls (2) of
the reservoir (1), the metal heating plate (5) having

for this purpose an annular rim (5c), 
characterised in
that
:

the heating means (3) includes a thermal diffusion
plate (10) connected on the one hand to the bottom

surface (5b) of a central portion of the metal heating
plate (5) and, on the other hand, to the electric

resistance (4) in the form of an open circle or a U,
providing a high localised thermal power,
the thickness of the thermal diffusion plate (10)
is greater than that of the metal heating plate (5) but

thin enough to limit the thermal inertia of the heating
means (3), 
the conical annular rim (5c) of the metal heating
plate (5) in the downward direction joins the

peripheral zone (6) to the said central portion of the
metal heating plate (5) while not extending below a

plane along which the said central portion extends, and
a thermal limiter (18) is mounted on the thermal
diffusion plate (10).
An electric kettle according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the heating plate (5) is made of
a metal material which, at a temperature between 0째C

and 20째C, has a thermal conductivity less than 50 W/m.K
while the thermal diffusion plate (10) is made of a

material which, at a temperature between 0째C and 20째C,
has a thermal conductivity greater than 100 W/m.K.
A kettle according to claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the
diffusion plate (10) to the conductivity of the heating

plate (5) is between 2 and 16, particularly between 3
and 10.
A kettle according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the heating plate (5) is of
stainless steel or PTFE-coated steel, and the thermal

diffusion plate (10) is of aluminium, aluminium alloy,
or copper.
A kettle according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the heating plate (5) is mounted
on the reservoir (1) by sheathing its periphery (6) in

the plastic material of the reservoir (1). 
A kettle according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the heating plate (5) is
assembled mechanically by its periphery (6) on a

shoulder (7a) of the wall (2) of the reservoir (1).
A kettle according to claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the heating plate (5) rests by its periphery (6)
on the shoulder (7a) and is fixed on the bottom of the

reservoir (1) by a pin (20) connected to the thermal
diffusion plate (10).
A kettle according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the thermal limiter (18) is
connected to the bottom surface of the diffusion plate

(10) and fixed on said plate by riveting or screwing.
