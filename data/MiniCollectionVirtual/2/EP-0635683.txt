<ABSTRACT>
A combined boiler, in particular for a CH installation 
and equipped with a burner (8) and a CH boiler heat exchanger 

(10, 19, 6) for transferring heat of flue gases to CH water, 
and with a storage vessel (2) for sanitary water (S), the CH 

heat exchanger (10, 19, 6) being at least partly immersed in 
the storage vessel with sanitary water (S) and being adapted 

for transferring heat from through-flowing flue gases, both to 
through-flowing CH water and to sanitary water in the storage 

vessel (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas-fired central-heating 
(CH) boiler with a provision for supplying hot sanitary water, 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a boiler is known 
from FR-A-2672113. Such so-called combined boilers are well known and 
comprise a gas burner, a heat exchanger arranged in the path of 
the flue gases and included in a closed CH water circuit with a 
delivery pipe to radiators or other space heating elements and 
a return pipe, the sanitary water provision being adapted for 
the indirect uptake, by way of the heated CH water, of heat 
generated by the burner. With regard to the manner of heating the sanitary water, 
a distinction is made between the through-flow principle and 
the storage principle. In a combined boiler according to the 
through-flow principle, a sanitary water coil, connected at one 
end to the water mains and at whose other end hot water can be 
tapped for household use, extends through a vessel entirely 
filled with water from the closed CH water circuit. With a 
combined boiler according to the storage principle, an amount 
of water for household use is stored in a vessel through which 
extends a coil-shaped part of the delivery CH water pipe. In both cases, sanitary water is indirectly heated by CH 
water heated in the heat exchanger of the boiler.  
 The present invention concerns a combined boiler 
according to the storage principle. In combined boilers, the 
supply of hot sanitary water takes priority over the space 
heating function, i.e. upon a demand for sanitary water, the 
circulation of heated CH water is short-circuited over the CH 
water coil in the storage vessel, so that the heat produced by 
the burner is exclusively used for the benefit of sanitary 
water. Upon a demand for space heating, however, heated CH 
water always flows through the storage vessel. This makes it 
impossible to prevent a situation where, in winter for 
instance, when in the morning the temperature in the house is 
to be raised from 15° to 20° and the heat demand on the CH 
installation persists for a long period, too much heat is 
supplied to the sanitary water supply, i.e. the temperature in 
the storage vessel exceeds the set value (60-80°C). This leads 
to the switch-off of the burner and stagnation of the space 
heating process. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
combined boiler which does not have this drawback. A boiler 
according to the invention is characterized by the 
characterizing part of claim 1. The invention is based on the 
insight
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A combined boiler, which is equipped with a burner (8) 
and a heat exchanger (10,19,6) for transferring heat of flue 

gases to central-heating (CH) water, 
and with a storage vessel (2) for sanitary water (S), wherein 

the heat exchanger (10,19,6) is at least partly immersed in 
sanitary water (S) and is adapted for direct heat exchange 

between through-flowing flue gases, through-flowing CH water, 
and sanitary water in the storage vessel (2), characterized in 

that the burner (8) and the heat exchanger (10,19,6) are 
combined in an assembly (1) which enters the storage vessel (2) 

from one side, whereby in use the flue gases leave the assembly 
near the side from which the assembly is entered in the vessel. 
A boiler according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
heat exchanger (10, 19, 6) comprises a flue gas passage (17) 

which is bounded on one side by a CH water channel (10) and on 
the other by a wall portion (6) which is in direct contact with 

sanitary water (S) present in the storage vessel (2), said wall 
portion being at least locally in hea
t-transmissive contact 
with the CH water channel (10). 
A boiler according to claim 2, characterized in that 
heating surface-enlarging elements (19) extend in the flue gas 

passage (17) and are in direct communication both with a CH 
water passage (10) and with said wall portion (6). 
A boiler according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
heat exchanger (10, 19, 6), made of light metal, forms part of 

a premix gas/air burner (8) in a housing (6, 7) with a sidewall 
(6) and a closed end wall (7), the burner (8) being arranged 

centrally within the sidewall (6) with the combustion space (9) 
facing the end wall (7), the flue gas duct (17) in which extend 

the heating surface-enlarging elements (19) being bounded by 
said sidewall (6) of the housing (6, 7) and the CH water 

passage (10) arranged substantially coaxially between the 
burner (8) and the sidewall (6).  

 
A boiler according to any one of the preceeding claims, 
characterized in that the depth to which the assembly (1) is 

inserted into the storage vessel (2) is adjustable, such that 
the capacity of the boiler can be varied.
