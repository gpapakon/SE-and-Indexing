<ABSTRACT>
Mutual coupling effects, which would tend to degrade operation of a two-element (10 and 12) end-fire array over a frequency band, are overcome by provision of an inter-element coupling impedance which is effective to equalize the Q at the inputs (18 and 20) to the quadrature-excited elements. A quarter-wave transmission line section (34) is coupled between the inputs to provide such impedance, which has a value selected to offset the effect of mutual coupling on Q. For a pair of monopoles (10 and 12), the inter-element coupling line (34) is connected to the respective monopoles by quarter-wave sections (14 and 16) having impedances selected in order to provide desired input impedances. The performance of dual-element end-fire slot (Fig. 2) or dipole array antennas may similarly be improved. Linear array antennas of four or more elements (Fig. 8) are provided by forced feeding of the additional elements from the basic dual-element configuration in accordance with the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to multiple-element end-fire
array antennas according the preamble of claim 1, and to a
method for improving Q equalization of such antennas.The problem of providing antennas usable on the nose of
high-speed fighter aircraft requires meeting antenna
performance criteria, while also meeting constraints limiting
size, height, pilot view obstruction, air resistance, available
mounting space, overall complexity, etc. While in many
cases prior art antenna designs are available to meet desired
antenna performance criteria, typically such prior designs
cannot meet the very real physical constraints imposed for
applications on fighter aircraft.EP 0 435 562 A2 and EP 0 459 616 A2, respectively,
relate to linear array antennas in which efficient broadband
operation is achieved through forced excitation of three or
more small radiating elements, and to antennas using a
parallel array of such forced-fed antenna or other antennas.In attempting to design two-element end-fire arrays for
applications subject to such constraints, it was found that
antennas using relatively large radiating elements could be
provided. However, no solution permitting use of small
elements while maintaining desired antenna performance over a
significant operating band of frequencies was available. With
small elements used in an end-fire array of monopoles, for
example, the rear element has unusually low radiation
resistance because of effects of mutual coupling which are
severe with the small elements. This low radiation resistance 
increases the Q of the rear monopole, resulting in a poor
impedance match over an operating frequency band.In order to lower the Q of the rear element in such a
two-element end-fire array, the height of the monopole could
be increased or loss, i.e., series resistance could be
inserted. Both of these approaches are undesirable, particularly
in the applications in point. For a three-element
end-fire array, a solution was provided in the referenced
prior applications by effectively offsetting the low
radiation resistance of the rear element with the high
radiation resistance of the forward element by use of a
forced excitation system. That solution was effective in the
three element array because the rear and forward elements are
excited with signals of opposite phase. However, in a two-element
end-fire array the elements are excited in quadrature
phase, which precludes use of the forced excitation system.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide
improved dual-element end-fire
