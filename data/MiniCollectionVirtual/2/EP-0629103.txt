<ABSTRACT>
The two-part heating element (1) is connected electrically in series and coupled thermally to a temp.-dependent switching element (2) associated with a preheating resistor (6) bridged by a first diode (7). This resistor has e.g. 20 times the resistance of the heating element and its current is switched or varied by the set-point combination (3) of a second diode (8) conducting in the same direction and a bridging switch (9). When the second diode is bridged, the resistor becomes heated and the switching element is opened earlier than when the diode is operative.

A method of temperature regulation of heating apparatuses 
operated with alternating current, in particular electric heating pads or 

electric blankets, which are provided with a one-part or multi-part heating 
conductor (1), a temperature-dependent switch member (2) which is connected 

in series therewith and which is thermally coupled to the heating conductor 
(1), and a setting member (3) for presetting the reference temperature, 

characterised in that in the one direction of flow of the current the 
supply voltage is substantially completely dropped at the heating conductor 

(1) and that in the opposite direction of flow of the current the supply 
voltage is dropped for the major part at a preheating resistor (6) which 

thermally interacts with the temperature-dependent switch member (2), 
wherein the current flow in the opposite flow direction can be switched 

and/or varied by the setting member (3). 
A circuit arrangement for temperature regulation of heating 
apparatuses operated with alternating current, in particular electric 

heating pads or electric blankets, comprising a one-part or multi-part 
heating conductor (1), a temperature-dependent switch member (2) which is 

connected in series therewith and which is thermally coupled to the heating 
conductor (1), and a setting member (3) for presetting the reference 

temperature, characterised in that arranged in the current path is a 
preheating resistor (6) which thermally interacts with the temperature-dependent 

switch member (2), and wherein there is also provided a first 
diode (7) which permits a current through the preheating resistor (6) which 

is sufficient to markedly raise the temperature of the preheating resistor 
(6), only during one of the two directions of current flow, wherein said 

current can be switched and/or varied by the setting member (3). 
A circuit arrangement according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the preheating resistor (6) is arranged in series with the heating 

conductor (1) and the first diode (7) is connected in parallel with the 
preheating resistor (6).  

 
A circuit arrangement according to claim 2 or claim 3 
characterised in that the preheating resistor (6) is of higher resistance 

than the heating conductor (1). 
A circuit arrangement according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the resistance of the preheating resistor (6) is about 20 times greater 

than that of the heating conductor (1). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of claims 2 to 5 
characterised in that the setting member (3) is formed by a second diode 

(8) connected in the same flow direction as the first diode (7), and a 
switch (9) for bridging over the second diode (8). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of claims 2 to 5 
characterised in that the setting member (3) is formed by a second diode 

(8) and a variable resistor (10) which bridges over the second diode (8). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of claims 2 to 7 
characterised in that the heating conductor (1) is formed by a double cord 

wherein the preheating resistor (6) and the switch member (2) are connected 
between the two heating conductor windings of the double cord. 
A circuit arrangement according to one of claims 2 to 8 
characterised in that the switch member (2) is formed by a bimetal switch.
