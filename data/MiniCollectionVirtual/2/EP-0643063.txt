<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a higher order cuprate complex by 

reacting an alkyne with zirconocene chloride hydride to 
produce a zirconium intermediate which is reacted with an 

alkyllithium and a first copper reagent selected from 
R²Cu(CN)Li or the mixture CuCN and R²Li to produce a higher 

order cuprate complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein is directed to a process for preparing
higher order cuprate complexes of the general formula
 
from alkenyl zirconium compounds as reactive intermediates
in organic synthesis. The higher order cuprate complexes
are derived from the reaction of a cuprate complex with an
alkenyl zirconium compound. The higher order cuprate
complexes are useful for preparing omega side chains of
prostaglandin analogs and more specifically, 16-hydroxy
prostaglandin analog side chains.The state of the art of higher order cuprate complexes is
summarized in Synthesis, 4, p. 325, (1987) where higher
order cuprate complexes of the formulae RtRCu(CN)Li2,
RtCu(2-thienyl)CNLi2, and RtRCu(SCN)Li2 and their
uses are disclosed. Rt represents the group transferred
to an organic compound to form a carbon to carbon bond in
a subsequent reaction with the disclosed higher order
cuprate complex.The use of zirconium compounds to prepare prostaglandins
is shown in published European catent application 153,689
which describes the preparation of prostaglandin
intermediates. The application describes a zirconium
compound of the formula
 
wherein X is a halogen and P1 represents a hydrolyzable
protecting group. The zirconium compound is reacted with
a compound having the formula

wherein CO2P2 represents a hydrolyzable ester group,
in an anhydrous, inert organic solvent which contains a
salt or a complex of a transition metal as a catalyst.
The reaction mixture is treated with a protonating agent
to produce a prostaglandin analog compound of the formula
The reference describes the use of the zirconium compounds
to add an unsaturated omega side chain on a cyclopentenone
to form a prostaglandin analog. The reference discloses
that the reaction occurs in the presence of a salt or a 
complex of a transition metal catalyst which includes
salts or complexes of nickel, cobalt, iron, manganese and
palladium. The reference's preferred complex is a complex
or salt of nickel (I) which is produced in situ in the
reaction by using a nickel (II) salt (or complex) and a
reducing agent.WO-A 9115493 (published after the present priority date
but claiming an earlier priority) is related to higher
order cuprate complexes by transmetalation from a
corresponding zirconate intermediate by reaction with
R2Cu(A)Li2 wherein A is CN or SCN.C.A. 114, 61742 to Kalish, Vincent, J., published after
the present priority date is related to a method for
preparing prostaglandin analogs by hydrozirconation-iodination
of a terminal acetylene followed by

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a higher order cuprate complex comprising the steps
of:


(a) bringing into reactive contact, in a single reaction vessel, one equivalent
of an alkyne and a sufficient amount of zirconocene chloride hydride to

produce an E-alkenyl zirconium intermediate; and
(b) adding to the reaction vessel (i) two equivalents of an alkyllithium
followed by one equivalent of R

Cu(CN)Li; or (ii) two equivalents of an
alkyllithium followed by one equivalent of CuCN and one equivalent of

R

Li; to produce a higher order cuprate complex intermediate, wherein R
2

can be alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or heteroaromatic group.
A process as recited in Claim 1 wherein the reaction is performed in a
temperture range from -50°C to -78°C.
A process as recited in Claim 1 or 2 wherein the alkyllithium is methyllithium.
