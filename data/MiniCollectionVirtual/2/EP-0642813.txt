<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for returning basketballs falling in 
front of the backboard to a shooter at the freethrow 

line. The apparatus may be mounted to the backboard, 
a free-standing post supporting the backboard, or to 

the hoop bracket. The apparatus contains a closed 
frame which bends down and away from the backboard.

 
The closed frame supports a return surface such as 

webbing or sheeting. The apparatus may be easily 
attached for use, detached following use or swung into 

an out-of-the-way storage position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus which 
returns basketballs from the vicinity of the backboard 
to the shooter at the freethrow line. Prior to the present invention, there has been a 
continuing need for a basket ball return apparatus 
which is easily mountable near a basketball hoop and 
adapted to return the ball to the freethrow line in a 
manner which simulates the throwing of the ball by the 
official. There has been an accompanying need that 
such apparatus not be cumbersome and be easily 
storable and/or retractable, yet light in weight and 
simple to handle. Prior to the present invention, there have not 
been any such apparatus in existence. Existing 
typical prior art is evidenced by the following 
patents, for example. U.S. Patent No. 1,765,269 to 
Hatley granted June 17, 1930 discloses a frame of 
which upper ends are fixedly but detachably inserted 
into ring-loops extending from a lower edge of a 
backboard, with the lower end held by insertion into 
an extended base member lying on the ground; storage 
is possible solely by withdrawing the inserted upper 
ends and thereafter during storage folding at hinge-areas 
located at points positioned about half-way up 
the frame side-bars. U.S. Patent No. 3,917,263 to 
Wiley granted November 4, 1975 is a basket-like 
apparatus supported from the ground to be positioned 
beneath a basketball backboard basket such that a ball 
solely falling through the basket will be guided by  
 
railings forwardly to a shooting position. U.S. 
Patent No. 3,901,506 to Caveney granted August 26, 
1986 discloses a basketball backboard having side 
deflectors with a net attached to the side deflectors 
and to the backboard, with the bottom of the net 
fastened forwardly to the floor by unspecified floor 
inserts. U.S. Patent No. 4,291,885 to Cohen granted 
September 29, 1991, somewhat similar to that of 
Caveney patent, discloses a basketball backboard 
mounting apparatus that grasps the entire board and 
that suspends an upper end of a net from high points 
along the backboard, as well as from below the board, 
with the forward end having an attached strap for 
wrapping around a waist of a person, such as a bed-ridden 
person, such that the ball is returnable to 
that person lying in bed. U.S. Patent No. 3,814,421 
to Spier, Jr. granted June 4, 1974 is to a basket 
attachment, such that when the basketball goes through 
the basket, it will be caused to fall forwardly toward 
the center of the basketball court directly in front 
of the basketball backboard.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) for returning basketballs 
from a position under or adjacent to a basketball hoop 

having a hoop bracket (28) and mounted on a backboard 
(15) in a direction toward a corresponding freethrow 

line, which apparatus (1) comprises 1.) a closed frame 
(9) comprising a proximal member (10), two side 

members (11) and a distal member (12); 2.) a return 
surface (13); and 3.) a main hang brace (7); the 

proximal member (10) having a side-to-side dimension 
which is about the same as the side-to-side dimension 

of the backboard (15); the side members (11), 
proceeding from the proximal member (10) to the distal 

member (12), contain an angle in a downward direction; 
the distal member (12) having the shape of a rounded 

"V"; the return surface (13) being a single continuous 
member having a central axis and being connected on 

all sides to the closed frame (9) so that, when in the 
operating position, the return surface (13) slopes 

downwardly from the sides to the central axis and 
slopes downwardly from the proximal end to the distal 

end under the weight of the basketball; and the main 
hanging brace (7) comprises an upper member (6) and 

two side members (8), the upper member (6) being above 
and parallel to the proximal member (10) of the closed 

frame (9); the two side members (8) having upper and 
lower ends, the lower ends being "J"-shaped and 

capable of holding the proximal member (10) of the 
closed frame (9), the lower ends of the side members 

(8) of the hanging brace (7) and the proximal member 
(10) of the closed frame (9) being provided with 

openings (23, 23', 24, 24', 25, 25') which are aligned 
to provide access by a locking device (26). 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the 
proximal member (10) of the closed frame (9) is  

 
provided with a double set of openings (23, 23', 24, 

24') so arranged as to allow securing of the closed 
frame (9) in an outward position allowing for the 

return of basketballs and downward position for 
storage. 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein a rod (19) 
is extended through the upper member (6) of the main 

hanging brace (7) in a direction parallel to the 
proximal member (10) of the closed frame (9), a 

backstop (17) is mounted on the rod (19) on each side 
of the main hanging brace (7), each backstop (17) 

containing an upper member and two side members (18), 
the upper member being above the proximal member (10) 

of the closed frame (9), the two side members (18) 
having upper and lower ends, the lower ends being "J"-shaped
