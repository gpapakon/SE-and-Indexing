<ABSTRACT>
A refrigeration system has a high efficiency 
free-draining evaporator incorporated therein. Refrigerant 

compressed by a compressor and condensed by a condenser 
flows to the evaporator via expansion means, such as a 

capillary tube. The evaporator includes a conduit having an 
inlet at a higher elevation than an outlet. The conduit is 

free from obstructions and portions which can inhibit free 
gravitational drainage of the liquid phase of refrigerant 

flowing from the evaporator into a phase separator 
positioned below the evaporator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
refrigeration systems, and more particularly relates to 
placement of a free-draining evaporator and a phase 
separator in a multievaporator refrigeration system to 
increase the efficiency thereof. In a typical refrigeration system, refrigerant 
circulates continuously through a closed circuit. The term 
"circuit", as used herein, refers to a physical apparatus 
whereas the term "cycle" as used herein refers to operation 
of a circuit, e.g., refrigeration cycles in a refrigeration 
circuit. The term "refrigerant", as used herein, refers to 
refrigerant in liquid, vapor and/or gas form or phase. 
Components of the closed circuit cause the refrigerant to 
undergo temperature/pressure changes. The 
temperature/pressure changes of the refrigerant result in 
energy transfer. Typical components of a refrigeration system 
include, for example, compressors, condensers, evaporators, 
expansion valves, phase separators, control valves, and 
connecting piping all connected or coupled in a refrigerant 
flow relationship. The terms "coupled" and "connected" are 
used herein interchangeably. When two components are 
coupled or connected, this means that the components are 
linked directly or indirectly in some manner in refrigerant 
flow relationship, even though another component or 
components may be positioned between the coupled or  
 
connected components. For example, even though other 
components, such as a phase separator or an expansion 
valve, are connected or coupled in the link between the 
compressor and evaporator, the compressor and evaporator 
are still coupled or connected. In some apparatus utilizing refrigeration 
systems, more than one area needs to be refrigerated, and 
at least one area requires more refrigeration than another 
area. A typical household refrigerator, which includes a 
freezer compartment and a fresh food compartment, is one 
example of such an apparatus. The freezer compartment is 
preferably maintained between -25° and -10°C, and the 
fresh food compartment is preferably maintained between 
+1° and +10°C. This household refrigerator example is provided 
for illustrative purposes only. Many devices other than 
household refrigerators utilize refrigeration systems which 
include an evaporator operating at a temperature below a 
temperature at which the evaporator actually needs to 
operate. To meet these temperature requirements, a 
typical high efficiency multievaporator refrigeration 
system, described in commonly assigned U.S.
