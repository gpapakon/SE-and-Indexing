<ABSTRACT>
A telephone routing system for use with a programmable central office switch (26) 
and a voice messaging system (24), wherein the programmable central 

office switch (26) is of 
the type that provides prioritized features such as queuing, call forward busy line and 

call forward don't answer to the voice messaging system (24). 
The telephone routing 

system comprises a hunt group having one or more incoming telephone lines each 
having an individual hunt group telephone number (56) 

associated with it. Each of the 
individual hunt group telephone numbers (56) 

has a call forward busy line and call forward 
don't answer to the voice messaging system feature enabled but does not have a 

queuing feature enabled. A hunt group directory number is associated with the entire 
hunt group and has queuing, call forward busy line, and call forward don't answer to 

the voice messaging system features enabled. Calls are received by the hunt group on 
one of the individual hunt group telephone numbers. If all the telephone lines in the 

hunt group are busy, the call is forwarded to a common hunt group mailbox in the 
voice messaging system. The common hunt group mailbox plays a message asking if 

the caller wishes to leave a message or be placed in a queue. If the caller wants to be 
placed in a queue, the call is forwarded from the hunt group mailbox to the hunt 

group directory number. If all the telephone lines in the hunt group are still busy and 

an empty slot exists in the queue, then the call is placed in the queue. If all the 
telephone lines in the hunt group are still busy and there are no empty slots in the 

queue, the call is retrieved by the voice messaging system back to the common voice 
message mailbox, where the caller is instructed to leave a message or call again later.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of routing a telephone call to one or more
telephone lines according to the preamble of claim 1. It furthermore relates to a telephone
call routing system as defined in the preamble of claim 4. In more detail the present
invention thus deals with a telephone call routing system that include voice messaging
systems and programmable telephone switches, and to a method of routing a telephone call
making use of such a telephone call routing system.For medium to large businesses that receive many phone calls per day, it is
common for a telephone company to provide such businesses with more than a single
incoming telephone line on which to receive calls. The plurality of incoming lines are
commonly configured to as a hunt group. The hunt group has a telephone number
associated with it, which when dialed will cause a telephone routing system to attempt to
connect the call to each of the incoming telephone lines until an idle line is found.In addition to having more than a single incoming telephone line, many businesses
subscribe to voice messaging or queuing services provided by their telephone company.
For businesses that subscribe to a voice messaging service, if all the telephone lines in the
hunt group are either busy or go unanswered, the voice messaging service will produce a
computer-activated message instructing the caller to leave a message. The message is
recorded by the voice messaging system and is stored in a computer, thereby allowing
subscribers to listen to the recorded messages and call back customers who were unable to
get through.Alternatively, it is also common for businesses to subscribe to a queuing service.
With a queuing service, if all the telephone lines in the hunt group are busy, a computer-activated
message is produced telling the outside caller that all operators are currently
busy, and that the call will be answered in the order received.Similar features as set forth above may be implemented in Private Branch
Exchanges (PBXs) such as the SIEMENS HICOM 600 system. The 1988 Product Data for
this system disclose to hold incoming calls in a queue if all voice terminals in a hunting
group are busy. Alternatively, incoming calls which cannot be served immediately go to a
hunting group mailbox where callers can leave their messages. US-A-4788715 discloses an automatic call distributor system in which calls waiting
in a queue to receive attendant service are informed of the expected waiting time prior to
connection to an attendant. This permits

<CLAIMS>
A method of routing a telephone call to one or
more telephone lines in a telephone call routing

system including:

a Central Office Switch COS (26) in
electrical communication with a voice

messaging system VMS (24) and having
prioritized features including queuing, call

forward don't answer to the VMS and call
forward busy line to the VMS;
one or more telephone lines so as to form a
hunt group (50), each of the telephone lines

having

a) a telephone number and being provided in
electrical communication with a VMS hunt

group mailbox,
b) the call forward don't answer to the VMS
feature enabled, and
c) the call forward busy line to the VMS
feature enabled;
a hunt group directory associated with the
hunt group (50) and having a corresponding

hunt group telephone number (56), the hunt
group directory having queuing, call forward

don't answer to the VMS (24) and the call
forward busy line to the VMS (24) features

enabled;

the method comprising the step of automatically
routing the call to the first idle telephone line

of the hunt group (50);

the method being 
characterized by
 the following
steps:


if the call is not answered after a
predetermined number of rings, applying call 

forward don't answer treatment to the call at
the telephone line and automatically

forwarding the call to the hunt group
mailbox;
if an idle telephone line is not located
after sequentially trying all the telephone

lines in the hunt group (50), applying call
forward busy line treatment to the call at

the telephone line and automatically
forwarding the call to the hunt group

mailbox;
once the call has been received by the hunt
group mailbox, playing a recorded message

which provides a calling party to option of
disconnecting, leaving a message, or placing

the call in queue (70); and

of the hunt group (50); and
receiving the call from an idle telephone
line of the hunt group (50) that has not been

answered and forwarding the call to the hunt
group mailbox.
A telephone call routing system, comprising:

a Voice Messaging System VMS (24) having a
common hunt group mailbox;
a programmable Central Office Switch COS
provided in electrical communication with the

VMS and having prioritized features including
queuing, call forward don't answer to the VMS

and call forward busy line to the VMS;
one or more telephone lines that form a hunt
group, each of the telephone lines having


a) a telephone number and provided in
electrical communication with the hunt

group mailbox,
b) the call forward don't answer to the VMS
features enabled, and
c) the call forward busy line to the VMS

group telephone number, the hunt group
directory having queuing, call forward don't

answer to the VMS and call forward busy line
to the VMS features enabled,
whereby the COS (26) is operative to
automatically route a call placed to one of

said one or more telephone lines to the first
available telephone line of the hunt group;
characterized in that
 if a sequential try of all
the telephone lines in the hunt group (50) does

not locate an idle line, the COS is operative to
apply call forward busy treatment to the call at

the telephone line and automatically forward the
call to the VMS hunt group mailbox, whereupon a

calling party is provided the option of
disconnecting the call, leaving a message, or

placing the call in queue (70), the COS (26)
further being operative to automatically transfer

the call to the hunt group directory if the
option of placing the call in queue (70) is
