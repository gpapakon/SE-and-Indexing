<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to devices for rotational assembly of an arm 1 comprising a hole 5 with and between two branches 2, 3 of a fork 4. The device according to the invention is essentially characterised in that it comprises two cages 10, 11 which are mounted on each branch 2, 3 of the fork 4, each cage comprising two flanges 12, 13, means 14 for rotationally mounting the two flanges on one another, the flange 13 comprising a first part 15 of the two parts of a male-female connection 16, a shaft 20 mounted in the hole 5, comprising two end adaptors 21, 22, each end adaptor comprising the second part 23 of the connection 16, a linkage rod 30 connected, via its two ends 31, 32 to the two end adaptors 21, 22, and means 40 for controlling the displacement of at least one of the two end adaptors 21, 22 with respect to the rod 30 so as to bring the two parts 15, 23 of the connection 16 into cooperation with one another. Application, in particular, for making axle assemblies in public work machines, for example mechanical shovel loaders.
