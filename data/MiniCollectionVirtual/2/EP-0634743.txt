<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical pick-up 
device for recording information on a magneto-optic disc and 
reading the information recorded, and more particularly to an 
optical pick-up device capable of not only accurately 
detecting focus errors and tracking errors, but also 
accurately detecting magneto-optic signals and pit signals 
recorded on an optical disc by use of a dichotomous hologram 
without using any diffraction lattice. Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a conventional 
optical pick-up device. As shown in FIG. 1, the optical pickup 
device includes a laser unit 1 for emitting a laser beam, 
a diffraction lattice 2 for diffracting the laser beam emitted 
from the laser unit 1, thereby generating main beams and sub-beams 
for error detection, and a collimator lens 3 for 
converting the beams emerging from the diffraction lattice 2 
into parallel beams. A polarized-beam splitter 4 is disposed 
downstream of the collimator lens 3. The polarized-beam 
splitter 4 serves to reflect all of S-polarized beams emerging  
 
from the collimator lens 3 and a part of P-polarized beams, 
namely, beams polarized in perpendicular to the S-polarized 
beams. The polarized-beam splitter 4 also transmits the 
remaining part of the P-polarized beams therethrough. The 
optical pick-up device further includes a reflection mirror 5 
for perpendicularly reflecting the beams linearly polarized in 
the form of P-type wave by the polarized-beam splitter 4, and 
an object lens 6 for focusing the parallel beams of P-type 
wave reflected by the reflection mirror 5 onto an optical disc 
11. A modified wollaston prism (MWP) 7 is also provided. The 
MWP 7 serves to convert the beam reflected by the optical disc 
11 into a parallel beam through the object lens 6 depending on 
the presence of information recorded on the optical disc 11. 
The MWP 7 also separates the beam including three kinds of 
beams, namely, all of S-wave, a part of P-wave and a mixed 
beam of S-wave and P-wave, into five kinds of beams at 
different angles through the reflection mirror 5 and the 
polarized-beam splitter 4. The optical pick-up device further 
includes an imaging lens 8 for receiving the five kinds of 
beams separated by the MWP 7 and generating an image from the 
received beams, a concave lens 9 having a toric surface 
adapted to increase the divergence angle of the beams emerging 
from the focusing lens 8 and generate an astigmatism of the 
main beams (P-wave + S-wave) for detection of focus error, and 
a photo detector 10
