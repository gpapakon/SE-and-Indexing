<ABSTRACT>
A new friction modifier system is described. It has the capability of establishing 
and maintaining a substantially constant static breakaway coefficient of 

friction between a pair of friction surfaces that are periodically frictionally engaged 
with each other. Also this system is capable of maintaining a substantially constant 

ratio between (i) the low speed dynamic coefficient of friction of such friction 
surfaces, and (ii) the (midpoint) dynamic coefficient of friction of such friction 

surfaces. The additive composition yielding these results comprises at least the 
following components: a) a hydroxyalkyl aliphatic imidazoline in which the 

hydroxyalkyl group contains from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and in which the aliphatic 
group is an acyclic hydrocarbyl group containing from 10 to 25 carbon atoms; and 

b) a di(hydroxyalkyl) aliphatic tertiary amine in which the hydroxyalkyl groups, 
being the same or different, each contain from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and in which 

the aliphatic group is an acyclic hydrocarbyl group containing from 10 to 25 carbon 
atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction modification between a plurality of surfaces
which transmit power through frictional engagement with each other. More particularly
this invention relates to improving the performance of frictionally engageable
surfaces which during operation under actual service conditions are periodically
brought into frictional engagement with each other, such as in a wet clutch or wet
brake system.There are numerous situations in which it is necessary or desirable to
employ friction modifiers in lubricant compositions in order to beneficially control
frictional characteristics between the two sliding surfaces that are frictionally
engageable with each other. For example, the useful life of automatic transmissions
can be improved by selection and use of lubricants containing suitable
friction modifier systems. However, despite improvements made in the art of friction
modification, a need exists for improved friction modifier systems that have the
capability of establishing and maintaining a substantially constant frictional
characteristics between a pair of friction surfaces that are periodically frictionally
engaged with each other such as occurs in the operation of automatic transmission
shifting clutches, and like power transmission apparatus. In particular, a need
exists for friction modifier systems which have the capability of establishing and
maintaining a substantially constant static breakaway coefficient of friction (µS) of
such friction surfaces. Moreover another need is for friction modifier systems
which have the additional capability of also maintaining a substantially constant
ratio between (i) the low speed dynamic (µO) coefficient of friction of such friction
surfaces, and (ii) the (midpoint) dynamic coefficient of friction (µd) of such friction
surfaces.The static breakaway coefficient of friction reflects the relative tendency of
engaged parts, such as clutch packs, bands and drums, to slip under load. If this
value is too low, the slippage can impair the driveability and safety of a vehicle in
which such apparatus is utilized. Likewise, for maintaining proper shift-feel durability,
the ratio of the low speed dynamic coefficient of friction (or the coefficient
of friction at the end of engagement of friction surfaces) to the (midpoint) dynamic
coefficient of friction between the engaged parts should be kept substantially 
constant during long periods of service in vehicles equipped with such apparatus.
The ratio is often called as "static to dynamic ratio" or
