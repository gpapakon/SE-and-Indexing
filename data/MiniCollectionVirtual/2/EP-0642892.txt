<ABSTRACT>
For a combustion-powered, fastener-driving tool, a 
combined ignition and fuel system (10) comprises a battery 

(12), two normally opened switches namely a head switch 
(14) and a trigger switch (16), a fuel injector (18) 

including a solenoid (20) and an associated circuit (22) 
controlling the fuel injector to enable the fuel injector 

to inject a combustible fuel for a first time interval, a 
circuit (24) for producing ignition, and a circuit 
(26) 
for monitoring the head and trigger switches (14, 16), for 

disabling the injector-controlling circuit (22) if the 
trigger switch (16) is closed while the head switch (14) is 

open or if both switches are open, for enabling the 
injector controlling circuit (22) if the trigger switch 

(16) is closed while the head switch (14) is closed, for 
enabling the ignition-producing circuit (24) after a second 

time interval succeeding the first time interval, and for 
disabling the ignition producing circuit (24) when the 

injector-controlling circuit (22) is disabled as mentioned. 
The system further comprises a circuit (60) for monitoring 

the battery voltage, for comparing the monitored voltage 
to a reference voltage, and for enabling the injector 

controlling circuit (22) and the ignition-producing circuit 
(24) if the monitored voltage is not less than the 

reference voltage, and for disabling the injector-controlling 
circuit (22) and the ignition-producing circuit 

(24) if the monitored voltage is less than the reference 
voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a combined ignition and
fuel system for a combustion-powered tool, such as a
combustion-powered, fastener-driving tool.Combustion-powered, fastener-driving tools, such
as combustion-powered, nail-driving tools and combustion-powered,
staple-driving tools, are exemplified in Nikolich
U.S. Patent Re. 32,452, Nikolich U.S. Patents No.
4,522,162, and No. 4,483,474, Wagdy U.S. Patent No.
4,483,473, and Nikolich U.S. Patent No. 4,403,722 which discloses the
features of the preamble of claim 1.Typically, such a tool includes switches that must
be closed to enable ignition of a combustible fuel in a
combustion chamber by means of a spark plug. These switches
include a head switch and a trigger switch. The head switch
is closed by pressing a workpiece-contacting element, which
is mounted operatively to a nosepiece of the tool, firmly
against a workpiece. The trigger switch is closed by
pulling a trigger, which is mounted operatively to a handle
of the tool.An ignition system for such a tool, employing such
head and trigger switches, is disclosed in Rodseth et al.
U.S. Patent No. 5,133,329. The ignition system disclosed
therein employs photo-electric head and trigger switches,
as disclosed in Rodseth U.S. Patent No. 5,191,209.A fuel system for such a tool, employing a fuel
injector including a solenoid and an electronic circuit for
controlling the solenoid to enable a combustible fuel to
flow from a source into the combustion chamber for a time
interval after the head switch or the trigger switch is
closed, is disclosed in a co-pending patent application
filed November 13, 1992, for FUEL SYSTEM FOR
COMBUSTION-POWERED, FASTENER-DRIVING TOOL, and assigned
commonly herewith.As disclosed in the co-pending application noted
above, the time interval is defined by a resistive 
capacitive network including a thermistor responsive to
ambient temperature, along with a resistor arranged to be
selectively connected to condition the system for use at
higher altitudes and disconnected to condition the system
for use at lower altitudes. As disclosed therein, the fuel
system can be well integrated with an ignition system
according to Rodseth et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,133,329 noted
above.In such a tool, as known heretofore, a fan has been
employed to produce turbulence in the fuel mixing with air
in the combustion chamber. Also, a batterypowered,
electric motor has been employed to drive the fan. Since
the fan and the electric motor are large contributors to
the weight of such a tool and to its
