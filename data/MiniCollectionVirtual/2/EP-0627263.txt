<ABSTRACT>
A contaminated air purifying apparatus (1, 101, 201, 
301, 401, 501) capable of decreasing particles such as dust 

floating in air, soot produced by a combustion engine and the 
like and air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) contained 

in exhaust gas. Particulates such as dust, soot and the like are 
electrostatically negatively charged in an electrifying mesh 

section (10, 104, 210, 310, 406, 506) and collected in a 
purifying filter section (20, 106, 220, 320, 407, 508) by 

coulombic force. NOx is converted into N₂ and CO₂ by an action 
of carbon fiber or carbon particles, resulting in decreased in 

concentration. The carbon fiber and carbon particles are 
preferably modified into an increased surface area of 200 to 2000 

m²/g.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for purifying
contaminated air, and more particularly to a contaminated air
purifying apparatus which is adapted to decrease particulates
such as dust or the like floating or suspended in air,
particulates such as soot or the like produced by a combustion
engine, and air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx)
contained in exhaust gas of a combustion engine or the like.Conventionally, filtration using various kinds of filters
has been used for removing particulates such as dust or the like
which is one of air pollutants. However, the filtration often
fails to catch particulates of a microscopic size depending on
a filter used and tends to cause a filter used to be clogged
with particulates of a rather large size.In view of such a disadvantage, it has been proposed that
an electric dust collecting equipment be used in combination
with or in place of a filter. A typical example of such an
electric dust collecting equipment is generally constructed so
as to utilize corona discharge due to application of a high
voltage to particulates. Such an arrangement is shown for
example in DE-A-2310901. It is also known that such filtration
can be accomplished by electrostatically charging particulates
by corona discharge due to application of a voltage as high as
about 6 to 10kV thereto and then catching the particulates by
means of the electric dust collecting equipment having a voltage
of about 3.3 to 6kV.There is further known see DA-A-3921387 an arrangement
wherein corona discharge at a negative voltage of 4.5kV to 6.5kV
is followed by dust collection and removal of ozone at a voltage
of about 12 to 24 volts.Unfortunately, in each case the dust collecting equipment
thus constructed causes various problems due to application of
a high voltage to particulates, such as generation of large
unpleasant sound, production of ozone harmful to the human body 
and the like. Also, the dust collecting equipment exhibits
another disadvantage of being large-sized because it is required
to use an insulating material in a large amount.Further, materials which have been recently noticed as air
pollutants include particulates such as soot contained in
exhaust gas or the like and NOx. Removal of soot is carried out
by collecting it by means of a ceramic filter or the like.
Alternatively, it may be made by the above-described electric
dust collecting techniques using corona discharge under a high
voltage of 6 to 10kV. However, both techniques fail to be put
into practice because they cause a
