<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for and a method of data compression in which a 
coded message representing a digital bit stream is transmitted 

over a low bandwidth transmission link (3) and received by 
apparatus which includes a calculator (7) operable to create 

a sequence of output values comprising the calculated result 
of a generator equation. The output values comprising a 

digital bit stream may be converted to analogue form by a 
digital to analogue converter. By clocking the output of the 

waveform generating apparatus asynchronously, with respect to 
its inputs, a high level of data compression occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for and methods of 
data compression. Transmission of large amounts of information requires 
very large transmission bandwidths. This necessitates the use 
of costly communication channels for transmission with the 
consequent increasing demand on available communication 
bandwidths in both space and terrestrial systems. Also, the 
storage of large amounts of data requires the use of costly 
and large storage means. One object of this invention is to provide a means for 
reducing the amount of data which it is necessary to store or 
transmit, hence reducing the load on the associated 
communications channel or storage means.
 
According to this invention, data compression apparatus 
comprises:
 
   means for generating a coded message representing a 
corresponding digital bit-stream to be generated and for 
transmitting said coded message over a transmission path, 
and digital bit-stream-generating means operable to 
receive said coded message and to generate the 
corresponding digital bit-stream, in which the digital 
bit-stream-generating means includes calculator means 
operable to receive a set of input values which form an 
argument of a generator equation and to create a sequence 
of output values, each comprising the calculated result 
of a generator equation.  The duration and composition of the digital bit-stream 
may be dictated by the coded message. If an analogue waveform is required to be generated, then 
the output of the calculator can be converted to analogue form 
by the addition of a digital to analogue converter (DAC). The 
waveshape, frequency and other characteristic parameters of 
the generated waveform are again controlled by the content of 
the coded message. The clocking rate of the DAC can be fixed 
or controlled remotely by means of the coded message. By clocking the output of the calculator means 
asynchronously with respect to its inputs, a high level of 
data compression occurs. The use of a coded message, as a communications protocol 
rather than transmitting a complex waveform, greatly reduces 
the bandwidth requirement of the transmission path. For 
example, many analogue waveforms can be specified in coded 
form by a short burst of ASCII bits via a 1200-9600 baud 
serial databus. The embodiments of the invention exploit the principle of 
bit stream generation by which a sequence of output values are 
created, each value being the calculated result of a generator 
equation for a specified input value which in turn forms the 
argument
