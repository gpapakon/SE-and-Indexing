<ABSTRACT>
A scene based nonuniformity correction method (40) that computes and applies 
offset correction errors to a video signal corresponding to an image derived from a 

imaging sensor (11). A video signal derived from the sensor (11) is processed such 
that a vector representing offset correction terms is formed, and this vector is initially 

set to zero. Each element in this vector represents a correction term for a particular 
detector of the sensor (11). The ve
ctor is applied to each pixel of the image by a 
processor (13) as the pixels are read from the sensor (11). To measure the offset error, 

the image is separated into vertically oriented regions, each comprising a plurality of 
channels. The average of each channel within a region is computed (42), and a set of 

region vectors is formed, such that there is one region vector for each region. Each 
region vector is then globally high-pass filtered and then edges larger than a predefined 

threshold are detected (43), and marked (44). Then, each region vector is further separated 
into sub-regions (45). The isolated sub-regions are locally high-pass filtered. In 

one embodiment, the correction terms for each vertical region vector are averaged 
together, resulting in a single correction vector (48). The correction terms calculated 

for each vertical region may also be applied individually to each detector of the sensor 
(11). In this second embodiment, the offset level error in each region for each channel 

is calculated (49), wherein the offset level error at boundary edges is undefined. The 
correction terms corresponding to a region are applied as the detector (11) scans the 

scene and views a portion corresponding to that particular region. The correction terms 
are smoothed at region boundaries to eliminate noise due to boundary transitions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to imaging
sensors, and more particularly, to a scene
based nonuniformity correction method for use
with such imaging sensors.Nonuniformities appear at an output display of
an imaging sensor as fixed pattern noise. The
nonuniformities are described as noise because
they result in undesirable information. The nonuniformities
are described as a fixed pattern because
their characteristics do not change (or
change relatively slowly) with time. These nonuniformities
may also be thought of as detector
gain and offset errors. In the method of the present
invention, all errors are treated as offset errors.
Thus, the present invention accurately measures
the detector offsets using actual scene information.Once the offset errors have been measured,
there are several ways in which the corrections
may be applied. They may be used as the only
source of error correction. They may also be used
as fine offset correction terms in conjunction with
coarse offset terms and gain correction terms.
These other terms may be calculated using a number
of different methods. These methods include
coarse offset terms calculated using a thermal reference
source; coarse offset and gain terms calculated
as part of system initialization; and fine
gain terms calculated using thermal reference sources
or scene-based methods. EP-A-0439912 discloses such a dynamic detector
processing circuit for processing detector output data
using detector-error-correcting offset coefficients. In one current method employed by the assignee
of the present invention, one or more thermal
reference sources are used to measure nonuniformities
for a scanning infrared sensor and provide
data for the calculation of correction coefficients
that are employed to correct for the nonuniformities.
There are several disadvantages related
to the use of a thermal reference source-based
correction system First, there is added mechanical
complexity which leads to increased system
cost. Secondly, system performance may suffer.System performance suffers for two reasons. In
many cases, a separate optical path is utilized for
each thermal reference source. Thus, the correction
coefficients calculated using the thermal reference
source optical path may not be the proper
ones for the optical path of the scanning infared
sensor. This leads to imperfect correction. In less
sophisticated systems, the temperature of the thermal
reference source cannot be controlled. In this
case, the thermal reference source may not be at
the same temperature
