<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray image intensifier (11) has a vacuum envelope 
(12) consisting of glass, and an input window (13) 

consisting of aluminum and having a sectional meridian 
radius of curvature which increases from the central 

portion of the input window (13) to the peripheral portion 
thereof is arranged on the input side of the vacuum 

envelope (12) with a metal holding ring (14) and a Kovar 
ring (15). An input phosphor surface (17) is arranged 

adjacent to the inner surface side of the input window 
(13), and an X-ray image incident through the input 

window (13) is converted into a photoelectron image. In 
order to minimize an influence caused by scattering of 

X-rays or γ-rays incident through the input window (13), 
an input substrate is brought as close to the input 

window (13) as possible. A coaxial cylindrical focusing 
electrode (18) and an annular focusing electrode (19) 

are arranged on the side wall in the vacuum envelope 
(12), and an anode is arranged on an output end side. 

An output window (16) is formed on the output side of 
the anode (20), and an output phosphor member (21) is 

arranged on the inner surface side of the output window 
(16). A transmittance with respect to a radiation beam 

increases in inverse proportion to the energy of the 
radiation beam. A transmittance abruptly increases in 

an area extending from the intermediate portion of the 
input window (13) to the outermost periphery of the 

input window (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radiation image 
intensifier for converting a radiation image into a 
visible light image or an electrical image signal, and to 
a method of manufacturing the same. Note that a radiation 
beam, serving as a target of the present invention, 
for exciting an input screen is a radiation beam, in a 
wide sense, including X-rays, α (alpha)-rays, β 
(beta)-rays, γ (gamma)-rays, a neutron beam, an electron 
beam, heavily charged particle beam, or the like. As a typical radiation image intensifier, an X-ray 
image intensifier will be described below. The X-ray 
image intensifier is useful to examine the internal 
structure of a human body or an object and is used to 
convert, into a visible light image or an electronic 
image signal, a radiation image from a fluoroscopy system 
or a radiograph system for examining the transmission 
concentration distribution of a radiation beam 
radiated on the human body or the object. An X-ray image intensifier is demanded to efficiently 
convert an X-ray image into a visible light 
image or an electrical image signal while the contrast 
or resolution of the X-ray image is kept with a 
sufficient fidelity. In practice, the degree of 
fidelity depends on the performances of the constituent 
elements in the X-ray image intensifier. In particular, 
since an X-ray input part has conversion characteristics  
 
inferior to those of the output screen part, the degree 
of fidelity of an output image largely depends on the 
characteristics of the input screen part. In the 
structure of the input screen part which is conventionally 
used, i.e., in a structure in which a thin 
aluminum substrate is arranged inside the X-ray incident 
window of a vacuum vessel and a phosphor layer and a 
photocathode layer serving as an input screen adheres to 
the rear surface of the substrate, a total transmittance 
of X-rays incident on the input screen becomes low, and 
X-rays are frequently scattered at the incident windows. 
For this reason, characteristics having a sufficiently 
high contrast and a sufficiently high resolution cannot 
be easily obtained. Therefore, a known structure for causing an input 
screen constituted by a phosphor layer and a 
photocathode layer to directly adhere to the rear surface 
of the X-ray incident window of the vacuum vessel 
had been already described in JP-A-56-45556 
or 
EP-A-540391. In such a structure, the X-ray 
incident window of a vacuum vessel has a substrate 
which permits the X-rays to penetrate therethrough. For 
this
