<ABSTRACT>
A flexible implant (1) with a cylinder-like basic form has near 
its first end (2) an eye-like opening (3), the axis (4) of which 

runs transversely to the cylinder axis. The implant (1) can be 
closed to a ring form by guiding the second end (6) through the 

opening (3), and is thus suitable in particular for the 
treatment of reflux oesophagitis and/or axial hiatus hernia.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flexible implant, in particular for 
the treatment of reflux oesophagitis and/or axial hiatus hernia. European Patent No. 0 061 540 discloses the features of the preamble 
of claim 1. This document describes a prosthesis also known 
under the name Angelchik anti-reflux prothesis which is 
used for the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. It is essentially 
a C-shaped cushion element, preferably of silicon, at the two 
ends of which is attached a flexible strip in each case. In a 
surgical operation this prosthesis is placed around the distal 
region of the gullet (oesophagus), above the cardiac orifice 
(cardia) and below the midriff (diaphragm). When the C-shaped 
part encloses the oesophagus, the two flexible strips are 
knotted together. In this way a ring forms which prevents a 
rising of stomach parts into the thorax area in the case of an 
axial hiatus hernia, and simultaneously reduces a reflux of the 
stomach contents into the distal area of the oesophagus. The previously-known anti-reflux prosthesis cannot be inserted 
into the abdominal cavity via a cannula (trocar sleeve); a 
laparotomy is required for this. Only the positioning and the 
knotting of the two flexible strips are possible endoscopically, 
something which does, however, require much skill from the 
operator.  
 It is the object of the invention to provide an implant, 
particularly for the treatment of reflux oesophagitis and/or 
axial hiatus hernia, which can be inserted into the body cavity 
via a cannula in an endoscopic operation. This object is achieved by a flexible implant having the features 
of claim 1. 
Preferred embodiments arise from the dependent 
claims. The basic form of the implant according to the invention as defined 
in claim 1 is not C-shaped or ring-shaped, but cylinder-like. In order 
that the implant can be placed beneath the diaphragm around the 
oesophagus, it is of flexible design. Near one of its ends, the 
cylinder-like basic form has an eye-like opening, the axis of 
which runs transversely to the cylinder axis. After the implant 
has been placed to produce an annular shape, the other end can 
be pushed through this eye-like opening, thus closing the ring 
permanently. The size of the eye-like opening is selected so 
that frictional forces effectively prevent an opening of the 
ring once it is joined. The implant is preferably designed flat in the area of the eye-like 
opening. In the area of its second end, the implant can be 
provided with one or more constrictions, offset
