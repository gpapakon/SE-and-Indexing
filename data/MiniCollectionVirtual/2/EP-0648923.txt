<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust muffler (10) includes first and second internal 
plates (16,18) formed to define channels and chambers. The plates (16,18) 

are 
secured in face-to-face relationship, such that the channels 

define tubes. The tubes include an inlet tube (28,48), 
a return tube (38,58) and 

an outlet tube (42,62) each of which extends to or from a reversing 
chamber (32,52). A separate pipe (64) extends 

through the return tube (38,58) and 
into the outlet tube (42,62). The pipe (64) 

and the return tube (38,58) are 
dimensioned to permit a flow of exhaust gas therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field on the Invention. The subject invention 
relates to an exhaust muffler for achieving an efficient flow 
pattern in a narrow space. 2. Description of the Prior Art. Prior art exhaust 
mufflers include a plurality of tubes disposed within an external 
shell. The external shell typically is divided into a plurality 
of chambers which communicate with at least selected tubes. The 
communication between the chambers and the tubes may be provided 
by perforations, louvers or cutouts in selected tubes. Other 
tubes may have an open end extending into a chamber to provide 
the necessary communication. The tubes, chambers and 
communication means are designed to attenuate most of the noise 
associated with the flowing exhaust gas without imposing 
excessive back pressure on the exhaust gas stream. Tri-flow mufflers have an efficient flow pattern and 
are commonly used in the prior art. The prior art tri-flow 
muffler includes an inlet tube, a return tube and an outlet tube 
disposed in parallel relationship to one another. The inlet tube 
extends from the inlet end of the muffler to a first reversing 
chamber near the outlet end of the muffler. The return tube 
extends from the first reversing chamber to a second reversing 
chamber near the inlet end of the muffler. The outlet tube 
extends from the second reversing chamber to the outlet end of 
the muffler. The three parallel tubes in the typical prior art 
tri-flow muffler will pass through baffles which divide the prior 
art muffler into a plurality of chambers. Selected tubes may be 
perforated or louvered to enable gas communication between the 
tubes and the surrounding chamber. The relative dimensions of  
 
the tubes, the perforations and the chambers vary widely from one 
prior art tri-flow muffler to another in accordance with 
characteristics of the flowing exhaust gas. However, in most 
prior art tri-flow mufflers, the inlet tube, the return tube and 
the outlet tube will be of substantially the same cross-sectional 
dimensions to avoid unnecessary increases in back pressure. Perforated tubes passing through expansion chambers 
often are not enough to attenuate all noise associated with the 
flowing exhaust gas, and in many cases at least one narrow range 
of low frequency noise will remain. These low frequency noises 
typically are attenuated by a tuning tube having one end 
communicating with the flowing exhaust gas and having the other 
end extending into a closed low frequency resonating chamber.

An exhaust muffler (10;110;210) having an inlet (24;124;224, 
225) for receiving an in-flow of exhaust gas and an outlet (26;126;226) for 

permitting an out-flow of exhaust gas, said muffler (10;110;210) comprising first 
and second plates (16,18;116,118;216,218) secured in face-to-face relationship 

and formed to define at least one tube (38,58) having a selected internal cross-sectional 
area and opposed first (39,59) and second ends, said muffler 

(10;110;210) further comprising a pipe (64;144;244) having opposed first and 
second ends (66,68) and an external cross-sectional area less than the internal 

cross-sectional area of said tube (39,59), at least said first end (66) of said pipe 
(64;144;244) being secured between said formed plates (16,18;116,118;216, 

218) at a location intermediate the first (39,59) and second ends of said tube 
(38,58), the second end (68) of said pipe (64) projecting beyond the second end 

of said tube (38,58), said pipe (64) and said tube (38,58) being disposed in said 
muffler (10;110;210) such that exhaust gas flows in a first direction through 

portions of said tube (38,58) surrounding said pipe (64), undergoes a substantially 
180Â° change of direction between the first end (66) of said pipe (64) and the first 

end (39,59) of said tube (38,58), and flows in an opposed direction through said 
pipe (64).
