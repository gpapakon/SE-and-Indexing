<ABSTRACT>
An electrical round cable having a ribbon cable (15) which is twisted to produce a round shape and has a soft supporting strip (13), and a plurality of cable elements (15) which run parallel to one another, but separated from one another, and are fixed to the supporting strip (13) only over a relatively small region of their outer circumference. The ribbon cable (11) can also be used as such for applications in which the capability to fold and deform the soft supporting strip (13) easily is advantageous.

<CLAIMS>
A round electrical cable comprising at least one
ribbon cable (11) which is brought into a round

shape and has a plurality of electrical line elements
(15; 27) juxtaposed in the form of a band by

mans of a carrier (13), with the carrier being
constituted by a foldable carrier band (13) to

which the line elements are fixed along part of
their circumference, with the line elements (15)

being disposed on at least one side of the carrier
band (13) with a mutual minimum spacing from each

other which is at least as large as the maximum
line element diameter,

characterized in

that the ribbon cable is urged together to form
the round cable by folding of the carrier band,

and in that the line elements (15) are fixed to
the carrier band (13) along a circumferential

portion of 5 % to 40 %, preferably about 20 %.
The round electrical cable of claim 1,

characterized in that the carrier band (13) is of
textile-like softness.
The round electrical cable of claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that the carrier band (13) is
composed with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene

(PTFE). 
The round cable of any of claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that the carrier band (13) is
composed with material selected from the material

group consisting of solid PTFE, polyester, polyurethane,
PVC, elastomers, silicones, natural

caoutchouc, fabrics coated with one of the aforementioned
materials, each in foldable form.
The round cable of any of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the material of the carrier
band (13) has particles of electrically conductive

or electrically effective material embedded
therein.
The round cable of claim 5,

characterized in that the electrically conducting
material, depending on the desired overall resistance

of the carrier material, is embedded in
the carrier band material with a filling degree in

the range of 20 to 70 per cent by volume, preferably
about 40 per cent by volume.
The round cable of claim 5 or 6,

characterized in that electrically conductive material
is embedded selected from the material

group of carbon, copper, silver, aluminium, and
mu-metal.
The round cable of any of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that the carrier band (13) is

resilient in the longitudinal direction and/or
transverse direction of the line elements (15;

27).
The round cable of any of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterized in that the line elements (15; 27)

comprise insulated wires (17, 19; 27) , strands,
twisted conductor pairs, and/or coaxial cables.
The round cable of any of claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that the ribbon cable (11) urged
into a round shape is enclosed by a round outer

jacket (35).
The round cable of claim 10,

characterized in that between the ribbon cable
(11) urged into a round shape and the outer jacket

(35) there is disposed at least one electrical
shield of wound or braided wire or of an electrically

conductive metal or plastics band.
