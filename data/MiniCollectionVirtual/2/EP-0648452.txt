<ABSTRACT>
A height-adjusting device for backrests of chairs, the backrest consisting of an optionally padded back plate which is connected to a fastening element arranged longitudinally displaceably on a backrest support, locking means for the mutual clamping of backrest support and fastening element being present, the locking means consisting of a clamping body which is arranged on that side of the fastening element which is opposite the back plate, and the clamping body having at least one through-bore or at least one through-slot, further at least one anchor being passed at its one end through a bore or a slot of the fastening element and being held therein by undercuts and being passed at its other end through the clamping body and being connected by means of a bore and a bolt to a lever, furthermore the lever being pivotably mounted about the bolt and having a projection which can be pivoted in a clamping manner between the bolt and the clamping body, whereby the tensile force exerted on the anchor and the simultaneous pressure on the clamping body locks the fastening element and the backrest support to one another.

A height adjustment for the backrests of chairs,
more particularly office swivel chairs, wherein the

backrest consists of an optionally padded backplate (1)
which is connected to an attachment element (3) arranged

so as to be displaceable longitudinally of a backrest
support (2), and wherein locking means are present for

mutually locking the backrest support (2) and the
attachment element (3) together, characterised in that

the locking means comprise a clamping body (4, 5) which
is arranged on the opposite side of the attachment

element (3) from the back plate (1), in that the clamping
body (4, 5) has at least one hole or slot passing

therethrough, in that one end of at least one fixing
element (7) passes through a hole or slot in the

attachment element (3) and is fixed therein by undercuts
(15), in that, at its other end, the fixing element (7)

is guided through the clamping body (4, 5) and by means
of a hole and a pin (10) is connected to a lever (8), in

that the lever (8) is mounted so as to pivot around the
pin (10), and in that the lever (8) has a projection

which may be pivoted inwards between the pin (10) and the
clamping body (4, 5) to effect clamping, thereby causing

the tensile force exerted on the anchor (7) and the
simultaneous pressure on the clamping body (4, 5) to lock

the attachment element (3) and the backrest support (2)
together. 
A height adjustment according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the clamping body (4, 5) is

vertically adjustable between the attachment element (3)
and the pin (10).
A height adjustment according to Claim 2,
characterised in that the clamping body (4, 5) consists

of two mutually adjacent parts which are displaceable
relative to one another on an inclined surface, and at

least one compression spring (6) is positioned between
stops (4') of the two parts which tends to force the two

parts apart along the inclined surface.
A height adjustment according to Claim 3,
characterised in that the adjacent parts of the clamping

body are provided with matching detent means, such as
steps or teeth.
A height adjustment according to Claim 2,
characterised in that the clamping body is a resilient

element made of hard rubber or an elastomer.
A height adjustment according to Claim 1,
characterised in that a pressure body (11) is arranged

between the projection (8'') of the lever (8) and the
clamping body (4, 5).
A height adjustment according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that, on one side, the pressure body

(11) is pivotally mounted on lateral bearing (19) of the
projection (8'') of the lever (8) and on its other side

is rounded off and lies in a depression of the clamping
body (4, 5), wherein, with the projection (8'') pivoted

inwards, the pressure body (11) may be moved over the
maximum centre of pressure of the projection (8'') and

the pressure body (11) into a clamping detent position.
A height adjustment according to Claim 1,
characterised in that at least one tension spring (23) is

fitted between an upper region of the backrest support
(2) and a lower region of the attachment element (3).
