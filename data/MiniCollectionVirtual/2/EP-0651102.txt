<ABSTRACT>
An insulating slab (10, 60, 70) of a rectangular basic shape comprises wedge-like slab elements (12, 14) which butt against one another at their wedge surfaces (20) and are displaced with respect to one another, with guidance on the wedge surfaces (20), and can be cut into a smaller rectangular format. At the border surfaces (42, 52), which move apart or, preferably, move together upon displacement at the wedge surfaces (20), the slab elements (12, 14) have a groove and tongue arrangement. In the regions (26, 28), which are to be cut off in order to produce the smaller rectangular format, of the slab elements (12, 14), there is a division parallel to the plane of the slab, level with the groove (16, 22, 64) and tongue (18, 24, 62).

An insulating panel of rectangular basic shape, 
comprising wedge-shaped panel elements (12, 14) which abut 

against one another at their wedge surfaces (20), which can 
be displaced with respect to one another while being guided 

on the wedge surfaces (20) and which can be trimmed to size 
in a smaller rectangular size, and which have a tongue and 

groove arrangement on edge surfaces (42, 52) which during 

displacement on the wedge surfaces (20) move apart or 
preferably move closer together, characterised in that in the 

zones of the panel elements (12, 14) to be cut off to form 
the smaller rectangular size a division is provided parallel 

to the panel plane at the level of the groove (16, 22, 64) 
and the tongue (18, 24, 62). 
An insulating panel according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that it has a tongue and groove arrangement 

only on two edge surfaces (42, 52). 
An insulating panel according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that it has a tongue and groove arrangement 

on all four edge surfaces (42, 52, 66, 68). 
An insulating panel according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that on one edge surface (52, 68) it 

has a groove (16, 64) and on the opposite edge surface (52, 
66) it has a tongue (18, 62). 
An insulating panel according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that it has a tongue and groove 

arrangement on the wedge surfaces (20).  
 
An insulating panel according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that one panel element (12) has a wedge 

surface groove (22) and the other panel element (14) has a 
wedge surface tongue (24). 
An insulating panel according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the panel elements (12, 14) are 

provided in one piece, of uniform material and with slots 
(30, 32) for division. 
An insulating panel according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the panel elements (12, 14) consist of 

foamed material, in particular polystyrene particulate foam. 
An insulating panel according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the panel elements (12, 14) are 

formed from multiple layers of like or different materials, 
in that the tongue and groove arrangement is produced by 

layer shift and in that the division is effected by omission 
of layer adhesion. 
An insulating panel according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that the panel elements (12, 14) have a centre layer (72) 

of mineral fibre or glass fibre and on both sides outer 
layers (74) of foamed material, in particular polystyrene 

particulate foam. 
An insulating panel according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that the outer layers (74) are of equal 

thickness. 
An insulating panel according to Claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that the layers (72, 74) are glued in 

contact with one another in those locations where no 
division is provided.
