<ABSTRACT>
An end-of-stroke-cushioning device for a movable system, consisting of a piston (10) acted upon by the movable system and accommodated in a cylinder (11) in an axially displaceable manner, a closable main outlet (13), provided in the area of a first end face (12) of the cylinder (11), for pressure fluid contained in the piston space (14) circumscribed by the piston (10) and the cylinder (11), an outlet passage (16) connected to the main outlet (13), a secondary outlet (15), provided in the area of the first end face (12), for the pressure fluid, and also a choke valve (2) connecting the secondary outlet (15) to the outlet passage (16). The valve member of the choke valve (2) is connected to a control piston (21) which is accommodated in a control cylinder (22) in an axially displaceable manner and subdivides the latter into a first control-piston space (23) and a second control-piston space (24). Furthermore, a pressure-fluid connection (17) is provided between the secondary outlet (15) and the first control-piston space (23). Provided in the second control-piston space (24) is a force-generating device (30) acting in the direction of a volume reduction of the first control-piston space (23) on the control piston (21).

Apparatus for the end position damping of a moved system, 
comprising a piston (10) loaded by the moved system 

and axially displaceably received in a cylinder (11), a 
closeable main outlet (13) provided in the region of a 

first end face (12) of the cylinder (11) for pressure 
fluid contained in the piston space (14) bounded by the 

piston (10) and by the cylinder (11), an outlet passage 
(16) connected to the main outlet (13), an auxiliary 

outlet (15) for the pressure fluid provided in the region 
of the first end face (12) and also a restrictor 

valve (2) connecting the auxiliary outlet (15) to the 
outlet passage (16), wherein the valve member (20) of 

the restrictor valve (2) is connected to a regulating 
piston (21) which is axially displaceably received in a 

regulating cylinder (22) and subdivides the latter into 
a first regulating piston space (23) and a second regulating 

piston space (24), wherein a pressure fluid connection 
(17) is provided between the auxiliary outlet 

(15) and the first regulating piston space (23), and 
wherein a force generating means (3) acting on the regulating 

piston (21) in the direction of a volume reduction 
of the first regulating piston space (23) is provided 

in the second regulating piston space (24) and 
consists in particular of a sprin
g arrangement (30) 
which is preferably formed by plate springs and which 

acts on the regulating piston (21), characterised in 
that the force generating means (3) includes a pressure 

control connection (31) opening into the second regulating 
piston space (24) for a pressure control fluid acting 

on the regulating piston (21).  
 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterised in 
that the main outlet (13) is formed as a central axial 

bore (130) in the first end face (12) of the cylinder 
(11), and in that the piston (10) is provided with a 

central axial portion (100) which can be sealingly moved 
into the central axial bore (130). 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that an actuating member (4) is 

provided by means of which the valve member (20) of the 
restrictor valve (2) is movable into its closed position 

against the opening force acting on the regulating piston 
(21) and can be held in this closed position, with 

the actuating member preferably being electromagentically 
actuatable or pneumatically or hydraulically pressure 

actuatable. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the main outlet (13) 

stands in communication with the outlet passage (16) via 
a fluid connection provided with a blocking valve (132) 

and in that an intermediate abutment device is preferably 
provided for the movable element (50) and is in particular 

formed by the actuating member (4) or by pressure 
fluid in the control connection (31"). 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the intermediate abutment 

device is formed by an abutment (54) formed in a cut-out 
(54') of the movable element (50) and also by an abutment 

edge (55) of an abutment spigot (55') which can be 
moved into the cut-out (54') from the outside.

claims, characterised in that the main outlet (13) is 

provided in the lateral cylinder wall (110) in the region 
of the first end face and in that the auxiliary 

outlet (15) is formed as a decentral, preferably axially
