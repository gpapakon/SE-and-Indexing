<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a switch (points) for track used by linear-motor-driven vehicles, which switch connects a track to a left-hand or right-hand track depending on the position of the switch, the tracks having right-hand (11) and left-hand (12) rails and the right-hand and left-hand rails of the switch being exchanged to reverse the switch, provision is made for the right-hand rail (11) of the switch position to the left and the left-hand rail (12) of the switch position to the right to be combined into a rotating segment (1) which, by rotation through 90 DEG , brings the rail required for the respective switch position into the correct position, for the left-hand rail of the switch position to the left and the right-hand rail of the switch position to the right to be designed as switch blades (A, B) and to be able to be swung into the respective switch position.

Points for trackway of track-guided vehicles with linear motor drive, which connect
one trackway with a left or right trackway according to the respective points setting,

wherein the trackways have righthand and lefthand rails (8) - as seen from the unified
pointed points end to the forked points end - and the rails (8) are each provided with

stators (83), with lateral guide rails (81) for lateral guide rollers of the vehicle and with
horizontal guide rails (82) for vertical guide rollers (92) of the vehicle and wherein the

righthand and lefthand rails of the points and wherein the righthand and lefthand rails of
the points are interchanged for resetting the points, characterised in that the righthand rail

of the points setting to the left (11) and the lefthand rail of the points setting to the right
(12) are combined into a rotary segment (1) which by rotation through 90Â° brings the rail

required for the respective points setting into the correct position and that the lefthand rail
of the points setting to the left (31) and the righthand rail of the points setting to the right

(32) are constructed as points tongues (B, A) and are pivotable in for the respective points
setting.
Points according to claim 1, characterised in that the rotary segment (1) comprises
rotary beams (18), rail carriers (17), the righthand rail of the points setting to the left (11)

and the lefthand rail of the points setting to the right (12), that the rotary beams (18) are
mounted to be rotatable about the axis (19) of rotation and one end of each rail carrier (17)

is fastened to one end of each rotary beam (18) at a right angle, that the righthand rail of
the points setting to the left (11) and the lefthand rail of the points setting to the right (12)

are joined together at their outer sides at a right angle and one of the two rails is placed on
the other ends of the rail carriers (17).
Points according to claim 2, characterised in that the rail (C), which is straight in
plan view, is put on at the other ends of the rail carriers (17) and that at the outer side

thereof the rail (D), which is curved in plan view, is attached at a right angle.
Points according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the rotary segment (1) bears
in the end positions on supports (21, 22).
Points according to claim 4, characterised in that the rotary segment (1) and the
points tongues (A, B) have locks (23, 24, 25, 26) in their end positions. 
Points according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the rotary
segment (1) and the points tongues (A, B) are so coupled by connecting rods (14, 15) that

they are adjustable by a single drive.
Points according to claim 5, 6 or 7, characterised in that the locks (23, 24, 25, 26)
have monitoring devices.
Points according to one of claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the rotary beams (18)
are prolonged beyond the fulcrum (19) and have a mass balance (16).
Points according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that an electric
motor with gear (M) is provided as points drive.
