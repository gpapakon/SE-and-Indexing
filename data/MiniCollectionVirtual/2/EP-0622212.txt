<ABSTRACT>
Images are printed by marks formed in pixel arrays by 
a scanning print head. During each scan marks are made in 

a pattern that approximates at least portions of many parallel, 
separated lines -- angled steeply (best at about 

3:1 slope, or at least much greater than 1:1) to the scanning 
axis and shallowly to the print-medium advance. Areas 

are left unprinted between the angled lines during one 
or more earlier scans for each image segment, and filled 

in during one or more later scans. Preferably the marks 
are made with liquid ink, and the medium heated to hasten 

drying. Heating causes an end-of-page paper-shrink defect 
that accentuates positional error components parallel to 

the print-medium advance; but the lines at a shallow angle 
to that advance tend to minimize those components -- so 

the heating and steeply angled lines together promote high 
throughput while hiding the end-of-page defects. In practice 

the mark-forming includes placing marks only at pixels 
where marks are desired for a given image: the angled 

lines are incomplete where marks are not desired. The 
angled lines are at a steepest angle possible within design 

architecture of the scanning print head and print-medium-advance 
mechanism -- or the steepest such angle 

consistent with a roughly equal number of marks per pen 
scan (for desired images in which all pixels are to be 

marked) and avoidance of other types of defects. The most 
highly preferred pattern uses corner-to-corner diagonals 

in a cell three pixels wide and eight tall; this pattern 
is rotated to obtain two variants, all put down in three 

passes. For transparent and glossy media, drying is 
enhanced by a multipass (preferably six-pass) print mode 

in which the three maximum-diagonal variants are repeated 
to provide doub
le density, with half the advance distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to machines and
procedures for printing text or graphics on printing media
such as paper, transparency stock, or other glossy media; 
and more particularly to a scanning thermal-inkjet machine
and method that construct text or images from individual
ink spots created on a printing medium, in a two-dimensional
pixel array. The invention employs print-mode
techniques to optimize image quality (primarily on transparent
and glossy media) vs. operating time, and also to
minimize image distortion (primarily on paper) imposed by
an ink-drying heater.To achieve vivid colors in inkjet printing with
aqueous inks, and to substantially fill the white space
between addressable pixel locations, ample quantities of
ink must be deposited. Doing so, however, requires subsequent
removal of the water base -- by evaporation (and,
for some printing media, absorption) -- and this drying
step can be unduly time consuming.In addition, if a large amount of ink is put down all
at substantially the same time, within each section of an
image, related adverse bulk-colorant effects arise: so-called
"bleed" of one color into another (particularly
noticeable at color boundaries that should be sharp),
"blocking" or offset of colorant in one printed image onto
the back of an adjacent sheet with consequent sticking of
the two sheets together (or of one sheet to pieces of the
apparatus or to slipcovers used to protect the imaged
sheet), and "cockle" or puckering of the printing medium.
Various techniques are known for use together to moderate
these adverse drying-time effects and bulk- or gross-colorant
effects.(a) Prior heat-application techniques --Among
these
techniques is heating the inked medium to accelerate
evaporation of the water base or carrier. Heating, however,
has limitations of its own; and in turn creates other 
difficulties due to heat-induced deformation of the printing
medium.Glossy stock warps severely in response to heat, and
transparencies too can tolerate somewhat less heating than
ordinary paper. Accordingly, heating has provided only
limited improvement of drying characteristics for these
plastic media.As to paper, the application of heat and ink causes
dimensional changes that affect the quality of the image
or graphic. Specifically, it has been found preferable to
precondition the paper by application of heat before
contact of the ink; if preheating is not provided, so-called
"end-of-page handoff" quality defects occur -- this
defect takes the form of a straight

axis that is substantially orthogonal to a printing-medium-advance
