<DESCRIPTION>
 HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-CONTAINING GELS AND CONTACT LENS DISINFECTING USING SAMEBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to compositions and methods useful for disinfecting contact lenses.More particularly, this invention relates to gelled antimicrobial compositions and to methods using such gelled antimicrobial compositions to disinfect contact lenses.Contact lenses should be periodically disinfected by the user to prevent infection or other deleterious effects on ocular health which may be associated with contact lens wear. Currently, there are several different conventional systems and methods which enable the user to disinfect his/her contact lenses between wearing times. These conventional cleaning and disinfection systems can be divided into "hot" and "cold" systems. Hot systems require the use of heat to disinfect the contact lenses, whereas cold systems use chemical disinfectants at ambient temperatures to disinfect the lenses. Within the realm of cold disinfection systems are oxidative disinfectant, in particular hydrogen peroxide, disinfection systems. Disinfecting hydrogen peroxide solutions are effective to kill the bacteria and fungi which may contaminate contact lenses. However, residual hydrogen peroxide on a disinfected contact lens may cause irritation, burning or other trauma to the eye unless this hydrogen peroxide is destroyed, i.e., decomposed, neutralized, inactivated or chemically reduced. Therefore, destruction of the residual hydrogen peroxide in the liquid medium containing the 

disinfected contact lens is needed to enable safe and comfortable wear of the disinfected contact lens.There continues to be a need for a contact lens care system which effectively disinfects a contact lens and provides the user or wearer of the lens with assurance that the lens has been effectively disinfected and that the disinfected lens can be safely and comfortably worn. Summary of the Invention New compositions and methods for disinfecting, and preferably cleaning, contact lenses has been discovered. The present system invites active user (contact lens wearer) involvement in the contact lens treatment methodology. In so doing, the lens wearer is given added assurance or confidence that the contact lens has been effectively treated and that the disinfectant has been effectively removed before the treated lens is placed in the eye. Moreover, no prolonged periods of waiting for the lens to be disinfected is a disinfectant-containing liquid solution are required. The contact lens is

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An antimicrobial composition useful for disinfecting a contact lens comprising: water; hydrogen peroxide in an amount effective to disinfect a contact lens contacted with said antimicrobial composition; and a gelling component in an amount effective to maintain said antimicrobial composition as a gel.
2. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 which has a pH in the range of about 5.5 to about 7.0.
3. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 wherein said hydrogen peroxide is present in an amount in the range of about 1.5% to about 6% (w/v) of said antimicrobial composition.
4. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 which further comprises a wetting component in an amount effective to facilitate the contacting of said antimicrobial composition and the contact lens.
5. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 which further comprises a dye component in an amount effective to give said antimicrobial composition a distinctive color.
6. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 which further comprises at least one enzyme capable of removing debris from a contact lens in an amount effective to remove debris from a debris laden contact lens. 


 7. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 wherein said gelling component is present in an amount in the range of 0.5% to about 20% (w/v) said antimicrobial composition.
8. The antimicrobial composition of claim 1 wherein said gelling component is selected from the group consisting of carboxypolymethylene, polyethylene-polypropyleneglycols and mixtures thereof.
9. A method for disinfecting a contact lens which comprises: contacting a contact lens with an antimicrobial composition comprising water, hydrogen peroxide and a gelling component in an amount effective to maintain said antimicrobial composition as a gel prior to said contacting, said contacting occurring at conditions effective to disinfect said contact lens.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein said contacting step comprises manually rubbing said antimicrobial composition on said contact lens.
