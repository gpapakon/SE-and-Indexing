<ABSTRACT>
A thin, relatively hard wiper (10) is provided, the wiper (10) including a 
blade defined by a pair of opposed substantially planar surfaces (16
a
, 16
b
) which 
are spaced less than 0.008-inches apart. The surfaces (16
a
, 16
b
) run parallel to 
one another, with each surface (16
a
, 16
b
) terminating in a wiping edge (18
a
, 18
b
) 
at a first end (12
a
) of the blade. To provide a blade of desired thickness (T), the 
wiper (10) is formed from a polymer having a modulus of elasticity within the 

range of between 100,000-psi to 5,000,000-psi. Such polymers are commonly 
available as sheet material, allowing for stamp-forming of the wiper (10), 

minimizing manufacturing cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to ink-jet printers, and more 
particularly to an improved wiper for use in such printers. The invented wiper is 
thinner than conventional wipers, and is formed from a relatively hard material 
so as to overcome the problems commonly associated with wiper wear. As will be appreciated by those familiar with printer technology, a 
conventional ink-jet printer includes a printhead which deposits ink onto media 
such as paper sheets. The printhead is mounted on a bi-directionally movable 
carriage, such carriage being configured to reciprocate back and forth across the 
paper as printing occurs. The structure and operation of such printheads and 
carriages are well known to those skilled in the art. In order to keep printheads in proper working condition, most ink-jet 
printers employ mechanism at some point along the printhead's path to 
periodically service the printhead during normal use. Such mechanism generally 
includes a wiper with a wiping edge which sweeps across the printhead to clear 
its printing surface of contaminants such as dried or drying ink. In the past, 
wipers have been molded from an elastomeric material such as ethylene 
polypropylene diener monomer (EPDM), a material chosen for its flexibility and 
conformality to the printing surface of the printhead. Conventional wipers, it will be noted, include a chassis-mounted 
base and an elongate blade which extends from the base to a tip which engages 
the printhead's printing surface when the printhead passes thereacross. The blade 
is typically planar and is of a size determined by the physical characteristics of the 
printer in which it is employed. In known ink-jet printers, the length is 
approximately 0.300-inches (accommodating printhead interference) and the width 
is approximately 0.315-inches (ensuring that the wiper will wipe the entire 
printhead). The blade's thickness is determined with these parameters in mind 
to produce a wiper which exerts a desired force on the printhead upon 
interference engagement therewith. Conventional EPDM wipers have blade 
thickness of approximately 0.050-inches.  Although conventional wipers have proven effective when new, the 
just-described arrangement presents particular problems as the wipers wear. 
After continued use, the wiping edges become rounded due to the repeated 
passage of the printhead thereacross. As the edges wear, the effectiveness of the 
wiper declines due to the increase in the surface area which contacts the printing 
surface of the
