<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved procedure for the manufacture 
of a diagnostic test device comprising a matrix 

having uniformly dispersed a tetrazolium salt and a 
reagent system designed to convert the tetrazolium to 

its colored formazan upon contacting the matrix with a 
fluid containing an analyte whose presence and/or 

concentration is being sought. The procedure involves 
applying the tetrazolium salt to the matrix from its 

solution in an organic solvent and, after drying, 
applying the reagent system to the matrix from its 

aqueous solution to which has been added hexanesulfonate 
as wetting agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
Tetrazolium salts, such as 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl
tetrazolium (INT), are useful in
the measurement of analytes which can be converted to
an equivalent concentration of NADH due to the reduction
of the tetrazolium cation to its corresponding formazan
which reduction can be accurately measured by colorimetric
means.A typical reagent system for determining concentration
of an analyte, such as glucose, in body fluids
is based on reductive chemistry wherein the primary
components are hexokinase (HK), adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH),
diaphorase, nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide (NAD) and
a tetrazolium salt as indicator. In operation, hexokinase
catalyzes the reaction in which, in the presence
of the analyte, e.g. glucose, and magnesium as enzyme
activator a phosphate radical is taken from ATP thereby
converting it to adenosine diphosphate to form glucose-6-phosphate
which is oxidized in the presence of NAD
and G-6-PDH thereby reducing NAD to NADH. The NADH, in
the presence of diaphorase as electron acceptor,
reduces the colorless tetrazolium salt to its colored 
formazan counterpart thereby providing a detectable
response which is directly quantitative for the detection
of NADH and indirectly quantitative for the
analyte whose presence triggers the reduction of NAD to
NADH.Tetrazolium salt indicators are commonly used with
dry reagent formulations which employ diaphorase or a
chemical mediator in the color generating step. An
adequate amount of the indicator must be present to
completely consume the reducing equivalents that
originate from the influx of an analyte such as glucose
into the reagent system.United States Patent 3,655,382 discloses tetrazolium
thiazolium salts in which the counteranion can
be chloride, iodide, bromide, thiocyanate, thiosulfate,
sulfate, paratoluenesulfonate, methylsulfate, ethyl
sulfate, nitrate, acetate, perchlorate, perborate,
sulfite, hydroxide or carbonate.In United States Patent 4,221,864 the patentees
state that one of the objects of their invention is to
provide a novel light sensitive photographic material
containing a tetrazolium compound. They point out that
this and other objects can be attained by preparing a
photographic material which comprises a support and at
least one light sensitive silver halide layer and
another hydrophylic colloidal layer coated on the
support, one of which layers contains a tetrazolium
salt. They point out that where the salt of a tetrazolium
compound is used as a non-diffusible
