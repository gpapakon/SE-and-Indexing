Enclosure (1) for the repair of a vehicle portion (6), 
enclosing, on the one hand, all or a part of the vehicle and, on 

the other hand, the assembly of the means necessary for the 
repair of said vehicle, said enclosure being equipped, at one of 

its sides, with at least one opening (3) for the introduction of 
said vehicle (6), characterized in that it comprises a plurality 

of modular panels (2), forming ceiling, walling, floor, the 
panels being secured to one another so as to form the total 

volume of the enclosure, said opening being provided, over all 
or a part of its periphery, with a sealing member (4, 4G, 4D) 

which assures an opening cross-section, hugs the shape and 
contours of a vehicle and enables said enclosure to be used in a 

configuration reduced in volume and in energy. 
Enclosure for vehicle repair according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the sealing member (4, 4G, 4D) is realized, notably, in 

the form of a U-shaped inflatable seal (5, 5G, 5D), assuring an 
opening cross-section which hugs the cross-section of the 

vehicle (6). 
Enclosure for vehicle repair according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the sealing member (4, 4G, 4D) is mounted 

on retractable panels (7, 7G, 7D) actuated by any known means 
such as pneumatic or hydraulic jacks and cooperating with the 

periphery of said opening (3). 
Enclosure for vehicle repair according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that within the panels (2) 

forming, notably, the walling, there are disposed illumination 
means (8) and, within the panels (2) forming, notably, the 

ceiling, the air filtration systems (9) and that filter baskets 
(11) for solid particles are provided at the level of the floor.  

 
Enclosure for vehicle repair according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the repair enclosure (1) 

is equipped with a battery of extraction fans (16) and input 
fans (12), the air flow rate of which may be modified 

by regulating and branching means (15) disposed on the 
extraction or intake air ducts. 
Repair enclosure for vehicle repair according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there is available, at 

the level of the floor of the enclosure (1), a chassis provided 
with an access ramp (24) or with an elevator bridge (17), 

allowing the user to work in good ergonomic conditions. 
Repair enclosure for vehicle repair according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there is available, in 

the under-frame of the enclosure, a sealing system (18), notably 
constructed in the form of a flexible blade (19) retractable 

into a cavity (20) by a pneumatic or hydraulic jack system, 
assuring the sealing of the space contained between the floor 

(21) of the vehicle and said under-frame (22). 
Repair enclosure for vehicle repair according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there are available, in 

the ventilation ducts or in the enclosure, convection or 
radiation heating means (23), used alone or in combination as a 

function of the conditions of use of the various paints, and 
constructed in the form of electrical resistors or 

electromagnetic wave emitters of variable frequency.
