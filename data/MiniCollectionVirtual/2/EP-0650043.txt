<ABSTRACT>
An optical system for high-sensitivity reflectivity 
measurement equipment has a simple structure that enhances 

the light utilization efficiency and simplifies the 
production process and reduces the cost. An aspherical 

concave mirror (10) with a predetermined central opening 
and a focal point (F21) set on the outside of the end 

surface of the opening is used. The region width of the 
mirror surface (10a) measured from the end surface of the 

opening is so determined that the light, incident from a 
proper light source (S2) and reflected by the mirror 

surface (10a), enters a sample (12) placed at the focal 
point (F21) at an incident angle Θ in the range of 60° ≦ 

90°. Incident light is reflected by the aspherical concave 
mirror and the sample surface and again by the aspherical 

concave mirror so as to become outgoing light for 
detection. Thus, appropriate and efficient incidence of 

light to the sample (12) is enabled by a very simple 
structure having the aspherical concave mirror (10) as the 

main element so that high utilization of effective light is 
enabled and the detection accuracy is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical system for
high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement equipment and,
more especially, to an optical system which is used in
high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement equipment for
detecting incident light which enters a sample at a large
incident angle and is reflected thereby.Determination of absorbance, for estimating a sample
on the basis of the absorbance, by detecting the light
transmitted through the sample is unsuitable for measuring
the absorbance of a thin film having a thickness of not
more than the wavelength of infrared, for example, by using
infrared. As a method effective for infrared spectroscopy,
a high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement has recently
been known. The high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement
is a method of projecting light onto a sample at an
incident angle of not less than 60 degrees and less than 90
degrees, and judging the absorbance of light on the surface
of the sample by detecting the reflected light.In a recent infrared spectroscopy, an FT
(Fourier-Transform) system is adopted, and the
high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement has attracted
more and more attention. The adoption of the FT system to
infrared spectroscopy has made the infrared spectroscopy
applicable to a microscopic measurement, so that various
kinds of infrared microscopic measurement equipments are
now commercially available. Various methods which are
adopted in general infrared spectroscopes have also been
applied to a microscopic measurement.However, it is very difficult to apply the
high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement to general
infrared microscopic measurements.A Cassegrainian mirror is usually used as the object
mirror of a general infrared microscope. In a
high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement using the
Cassegrainian mirror, since it is necessary that the
incident angle of light relative to a sample is 60 to 90 
degrees, the Cassegrainian mirror must have a large angular
aperture.It is possible to produce a Cassegrainian mirror
having a large angular aperture in principle, but the
production is technically very difficult. In addition,
since a Cassegrainian mirror having a large angular
aperture diffuses light in a wide range, the utilization
efficiency of light is greatly lowered in comparison with
a general Cassegrainian mirror. The application of
high-sensitivity reflectivity measurement equipment to a
microscopic measurement has not been generalized because an
objective mirror type measurement equipment is required in
a microscopic
