<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns layer-structure elements consisting of at least one plastic-foam and/or latex-foam layer plus particulate, superabsorbent polymers for the absorption of water and aqueous liquids. The elements contain the superabsorber, located on, between or under the foamed-plastic and/or foamed-latex layer, in specified amounts and/or locations and a fixed weight per unit area, and in a ratio of plastic foam and/or latex foam to superabsorber of 1:500 to 50:1. The plastic/latex foam can contain fillers, pigments and/or synthetic fibres. The layered elements have an elevated absorbing power for water and aqueous liquids, particularly when under stress. They are manufactured by spreading the foam over a flat surface and applying the superabsorber in the required proportion, optionally using a template, the superabsorber then being fixed by heating. Layered elements of this kind are suitable for use in personal-hygiene articles, as components of natural or synthetic floors, as insulating materials for pipes and lines, above all cables, and building constructions, as liquid-absorbing and retaining components in packaging materials and as parts of garments.
