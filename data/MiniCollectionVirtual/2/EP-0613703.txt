Snowshoe with a general plane of symmetry P comprising a 
mesh (4), which bears a fastening means (5) arranged to 

pivot upwards in relation to a support (18) around a 
transverse axis XX' to receive the shoe (6) of the user, 

characterised in that said fastening means (5) is 
connected to said mesh (4) to allow it to pivot 

laterally around an essentially longitudinal axis YY'. 
Snowshoe according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
axis YY' is disposed in the plane P. 
Snowshoe according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
axis YY' is sloping in relation to the plane P. 
Snowshoe according to either of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the fastening means (5) is 

connected to a support (18) which is articulated to the 
mesh (4) around the axis YY'. 
Snowshoe according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
support (18) is a support frame, the two side walls (19, 

20) of which are such that their lower edges (190, 200) 
project below the lower surface (9, P1) of the snowshoe. 
Snowshoe according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
transverse axis XX' is located above the longitudinal 

axis YY' which is in the plane P. 
Snowshoe according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
transverse axis XX' is disposed above the upper surface 

(90) of the snowshoe, while the axis YY' is disposed 
below this surface.  

 
Snowshoe according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
fastening means (5) comprises a longitudinal plate (10), 

on which the shoe (6) is held, said plate (10) being 
articulated around the transverse axis XX' on a support 

frame (18) arranged to pivot in the mesh around the 
longitudinal axis YY'.
