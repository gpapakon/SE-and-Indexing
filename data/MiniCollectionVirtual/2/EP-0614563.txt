<ABSTRACT>
Reduction of vertical "crosstalk" in dot-matrix liquid-crystal display devices, and achievement of grey levels with the aid of pulse-height modulation. In RMS addressing (multiplexing) of liquid-crystal display devices having a matrix structure, vertical crosstalk is reduced by presenting data voltages having mutually different amplitude to the separate column electrodes. The different data signals are chosen in accordance with the number of level changes of the data voltage in the various columns. Vertical crosstalk can also be reduced, without modifying the data voltages, by using voltage pulses which are presented simultaneously to the separate columns after each frame scan and whose magnitude is determined by the number of level changes in the data voltage in the column concerned. Grey levels are generated in RMS multiplexed dot-matrix display devices with the aid of pulse-height modulation, in which case voltage pulses are presented (simultaneously) to the separate columns after every frame scan, the magnitude of said voltage pulses being determined by the picture content of the elements in the column concerned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display device, comprising a
liquid-crystal material between two support plates held at a defined
spacing from one another and having surfaces facing one
another, a pattern of N line electrodes being provided on one
surface and a pattern of column electrodes on the other surface
in which the line electrodes cross the column electrodes and a
matrix of display elements is thus formed at the position of the
crossovers, and the device comprises a control circuit for presenting
square-wave data signals to the column electrodes and a
line-scanning circuit for periodically scanning the line electrodes
and presenting square-wave line selection voltages signals.Display devices of that kind are known from GB 2 020 875 A or US
5 151 690 A. The first reference shows an adressable matrix
which consists of liquid crystals defined by the crossing regions
of row and column electrodes. The state of such a liquid
crystal is related to the magnitude of electrical signals applied
to those electrodes and to the number of elements in the
matrix. The electric signals are modified according to the number
of elements in the matrix so that the operating margin between 
on and off potentials can be maximized. A certain number
of columns are scanned and energized in succession while the
states of the certain number of elements displayed in each row
are prestored and ciculated in a register for that row. Via a
circuit the voltage levels for on and off are determined to be
applied to the row electrode according to each bit in the register
and an elector is operated as each column in turn is
scanned.The second reference shows a very similar device where the scanning
electrodes are formed on one of two subtrates between which
a liquid-crystal-layer is interposed. Scanning electrode voltage
driving wave forms consisting of selective and non-selective
voltages are applied to the scanning electrodes of the liquid-crystal-panel.Such display devices are normally operated with multiplex addressing
in accordance with the so-called RMS mode.The method of addressing (based on the so-called RMS behavior of
the liquid-crystal material) is described, inter alia, by Alt
and Pleshko in IEEE Trans. El. Dev. ED 21, 1974, pages 146-155,
by Neahing and Kmetz in IEEE Trans. El. Dev. ED 26, 1979, pages
795-802, and by Kawakami et al. in SID-IEEE Record of Biennial
Display Conference, 1976, pages 50-52. This method of addressing
is regarded as the commonest for the addressing of liquid-crystal
display devices which are

<CLAIMS>
Display device comprising a liquid-crystal material between two
support plates held at a defined spacing from one another and

having surfaces facing one another, a pattern of N line electrodes
being provided on one surface and a pattern of column

electrodes on the other surface, in which the line electrodes
cross the column electrodes and a matrix of display elements is

thus formed at the position of the crossovers and the device
comprises a control circuit for presenting square-wave data signals

to the column electrodes and a line scanning circuit for

periodically scanning the line electrodes and presenting square-wave
line-selection voltage signals;

characterized in that the display device comprises an electronic
circuit unit generating grey values by means of pulse-height modulation

and which registers the associated value of the parameter
X
au
 (j) which is defined as the number of times the level of
the data voltage changes for each column j of the matrix of display

elements and for each raster scan, whereby during the raster
scan, the amplitude V
d
 of the data voltage +/- V
d
, which is
across a picture element during the non-select period in the case

of the given description of the line-at-a-time addressing is
different for columns having a different X
au
 value and the chosen
value of V
d
 is greater to the extent that X
au
 is greater and, in
particular, in accordance with a relationship V
d
 = V
d

au
) which
is determined by proceeding from the requirement that picture

elements which are assumed to be in the same state but occur in
columns with a different X
au
 value must have equal, or virtually
equal V
RMS
 voltages, further the same V
d
 value
is used for a range of X
au
 values, viz. from X
au
 up to and including
(X
au
 + n) where n = 1, 2, 3, and that an appropriate voltage 
whose amplitude (AMP
c
) is determined by the X
au
 value of the
column concerned is presented to the separate columns for a certain

time interval after each raster scan, whereby the same AMP
c

value is used for a range of X
au
 values, viz. from X

 up to and
including (X
