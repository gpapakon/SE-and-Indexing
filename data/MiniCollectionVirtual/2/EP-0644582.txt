<ABSTRACT>
A dry etching method for a conductive material layer is 
disclosed. The dry etching method has the steps of: forming an 

oxygen-containing antireflection film (6) on a surface of a 
conductive material layer (5); forming a patterned mask layer (7) on 

the antireflection film; forming a sidewall protection film (8a) on a 
sidewall of the mask layer; and etching the conductive material 

layer (5) using the mask layer having the sidewall protection film 
formed thereon. The sidewall protection film (8a) is formed after the 

antireflection film is patterned using the mask layer. The 
antireflection film (6) is patterned after the sidewall protection 

film is formed, with the sidewall protection film left on the 
sidewall of the antireflection film. The sidewall protection 

film (8a) is formed by using at least one of sulfur based compound and 
sulfur nitride based compound. The antireflection film (6) is 

composed of an SiON based material. The conductive material 
layer (5) is composed of a material selected from the group 

consisting of a polycide film, an Al based alloy material layer, 
a Cu based alloy material layer and a refractory metal layer. 

The conductive material layer (5) is formed on a semiconductor 
substrate having an insulating film formed on a surface thereof. 

The conductive material layer is formed on an insulating film 
having a barrier metal layer formed on a surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dry etching method adapted for
fine processing of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and
particularly to a method for preventing regression of a resist
mask formed on an SiON based antireflection film so as to improve
anisotropy.In order to realize large scale integration of semiconductor
devices, the minimum processing size of the circuit pattern
formation has been rapidly diminished. For instance, the minimum
processing size of the 16M DRAM of approximately 0.5 µm (half
micron), the minimum processing size of the 64M DRAM of 0.35 µm
(sub-half micron), and the minimum processing size of the 256M
DRAM of 0.25 µm (quarter micron) are required.This increasingly fine processing depends largely upon a
technique of photolithography to form a mask pattern. Visible
to near ultraviolet rays, such as g rays having a wavelength of
436 nm or i rays having a wavelength of 365 nm, of a high
pressure mercury lamp are used for the current 0.5 µm class
processing, and far ultraviolet rays, such as KrF excimer laser
lights having a wavelength of 248 nm, are used for 0.35 to 0.25-µm
class processing. In the photolithography technique for 
forming a fine mask with a ray width of not greater than 0.4 µm,
an antireflection film to weaken a reflected light from an
underlying material layer is substantially required for
preventing reduction in contrast and resolution due to halation
and standing wave effect.As the component material of the antireflection film,
amorphous silicon, TiN and TiON are conventionally used.
However, since it has been shown that SiON (silicon oxide
nitride) exhibits satisfactory optical properties in the far
ultraviolet region, application of SiON to the excimer laser
lithography is proposed. It is exemplified by a process of fine
gate processing with an SiON film restraining the reflectivity
of a W (tungsten) - polycide film or an Al (aluminum) based
material film.Meanwhile, after the patterning of the resist mask by such
photolithography is finished, the antireflection film is etched
in the subsequent etching process.In this case, such a problem is now being apparent that the
anisotropic shape of the underlying material layer may be
deteriorated by oxygen discharged from SiON in the etching
process, particularly in overetching. This problem is explained
with reference to Figs.1 to 4.Fig.1 shows a state of a wafer prior to the etching, in
which a gate SiOX film 22, a W-polycide film 25 and an SiON
antireflection film 26 are sequentially stacked on an Si 
substrate 21,
