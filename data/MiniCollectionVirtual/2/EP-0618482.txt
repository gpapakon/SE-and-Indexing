<ABSTRACT>
A radiation sensitive emulsion is disclosed 
containing a silver halide grain population internally 

free of iodide at the site of grain nucleation comprised 
of at least 50 mole percent chloride, based on total 

silver forming the grain population. Greater than 50 
percent of the grain population projected area is 

accounted for by {100} tabular grains which have an 
average aspect ratio of up to 7.5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to silver halide 
photography. More specifically, the invention relates 
to radiation sensitive silver halide emulsions useful in 
photography. Radiation sensitive silver halide emulsions 
containing one or a combination of chloride, bromide 
and iodide ions have been long recognized to be useful 
in photography. Each halide ion selection is known to 
impart particular photographic advantages. By a wide 
margin the most commonly employed photographic emulsions 
are silver bromide and iodobromide emulsions. 
Although known and used for many years for selected 
photographic applications, the more rapid developability 
and the ecological advantages of high chloride 
emulsions have provided an impetus for employing these 
emulsions over a broader range of photographic applications. 
As employed herein the term "high chloride 
emulsion" refers to a silver halide emulsion containing 
at least 50 mole percent chloride, based on total 
silver. In referring to grains of mixed halide 
content, the halides are named in order of increasing 
molar concentrations--e.g., silver iodochloride 
contains a higher molar concentration of chloride than 
iodide. The most ecologically attractive high chloride 
emulsions are those that contain very low levels 
of bromide and/or iodide ion and preferably none. Of 
the halide ions available for use in constructing 
photographic emulsions chloride ions are the most 
ecologically compatible while iodide ions are the 
least attractive for use. During the 1980's a marked advance took place 
in silver halide photography based on the discovery 
that a wide range of photographic advantages, such as  
 
improved speed-granularity relationships, increased 
covering power both on an absolute basis and as a 
function of binder hardening, more rapid developability, 
increased thermal stability, increased separation 
of native and spectral sensitization imparted imaging 
speeds, and improved image sharpness in both mono- and 
multi-emulsion layer formats, can be realized by 
increasing the proportions of selected tabular grain 
populations in photographic emulsions. An emulsion is generally understood to be a 
"tabular grain emulsion" when tabular grains account for 
at least 50 percent of total grain projected area. A 
grain is generally considered to be a tabular grain when 
the ratio of its equivalent circular diameter (ECD) to 
its thickness (t) is at least 2. The equivalent circular 
diameter of a grain is the diameter of a circle 
having an area equal to the
