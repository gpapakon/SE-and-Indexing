<ABSTRACT>
A high performance optical imaging system can be provided by
minimizing the overlapping degree m, increasing the quantity of light of the

rod lens array 2 and improving the resolving power while taking into account
the irregularity of the quantity of light when a dislocation between a sensor

and an optical axis of an entire rod lens array 2 occurs. In the optical
imaging system, a plurality of rod lenses 1 with a refractive index distribution

in the radial direction are arranged in two rows in a rod lens array 2 with
their optical axes in parallel to each other. This optical imaging system

focuses light from a manuscript plane 3 onto an image plane 4, the planes
being arranged on the two sides of the rod lens array 2. The overlapping

degree m defined as the following equation (Eq. 10) is in a range of 0.91 ≦ m
≦ 1.01;


(Eq. 10)   m = X
0
 / 2R

wherein X
0
 denotes an image radius that the rod lenses 1 project onto the
image plane and 2R denotes a distance between the optical axes of

neighboring rod lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical imaging system used in an
image transmission portion of an optical device, for example, a facsimile
device, a copier, a printer, a scanner, or the like. More particularly, the
present invention relates to an optical imaging system including a rod lens
array, in which a plurality of rod lenses are arranged in an array.In an optical device, for example, a facsimile device, a copier, a printer,
a scanner, or the like, to read out information on a manuscript plane by
converting the information into an electrical signal, various kinds of scanning
devices are used. One form of the scanning device is a contact type device.
This contact type scanning device is formed by incorporating various parts
including a lightening system, a rod lens array that is a one-to-one imaging
device, a sensor, a cover glass (a transparent substrate), and the like, into one
frame. In general, a manuscript is brought into contact with the surface of
the cover glass and illuminated by the lighting system. The illuminated
manuscript is imaged on the censor by the rod lens array and converted into
an electric signal. Herein, the rod lens array is a one-to-one optical imaging
system in which a plurality of rod lenses having a refractive index distribution
in a radial direction are arranged in one row or two rows (see Fig. 2).An example of a lens material used for a rod lens array includes glass,
synthetic resin, or the like. A glass lens having a refractive index
distribution is produced, for example, by an ion exchange method.A single rod lens forms a one-to-one image within the range of a circle
having a radius XO (field of view). The quantity of light is at the maximum
on the optical axis and decreases with greater distance from the optical axis.
Therefore, the distribution of the quantity of light in the longitudinal direction
of a rod lens array has irregularity with the period corresponding to the
distance between lenses. The magnitude of the irregularity of the quantity of
light is defined as: 100 {(maximum quantity of light ) - (minimum quantity of
light ) } / (minimum quantity of light ) %, and determined by the overlapping
degree m expressed by the following equation (Eq. 3):
(Eq. 3)   m = X0 / 2R
wherein 2R denotes the distance between the optical axes of neighboring rod
lenses. Fig. 15 shows a relationship between the overlapping degree m and
the irregularity of the quantity of light, which are calculated by the below
mentioned equation of the distribution of the quantity of light
