<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inner shoe for ski-boots of the type
comprising a sole and an upper which includes a padding enclosed in a
inner and outer lining.The shoe type of the present invention must meet two requirements which
are partially opposite each other and also related to the features and
type of the outer casing (shell and boot leg) of the ski-boot.The shoe must allow an easy entry of the foot.The shoe must wrap the foot as tightly as possible so as to
transmit with the greatest possible accuracy the movements which start
from the skier's leg and foot and which through the shoe and casing reach
the ski.The shoe must maintain the comfort degree necessary to make the sports
activity more pleasant.The shoes made until now are of two types, namely of the front and
rear-entry type. In the first case, the front-entry shoe has a front
opening with flaps which can be opened wide apart and this opening can be
closed by a tongue provided underneath.In this well-known embodiment, although elastic and/or padded inserting
members have been utilized, the shoe with a front-entry shell may be put
on with difficulty.In the second case, the rear-entry shoe has an opening, for the entry of
the foot, extending from the heel portion up to the top of the shin and
closed on the rear part by a padded spoiler extending from the heel area
up to the front part below the calf. In this way, it is easy to put on
the shoe but it is impossibe to change the volume of the shoe at the
front part during the tightening by the fastening mechanisms.EP-A-0 308 368 discloses an inner shoe for ski-boots of the type comprising
a sole and an upper which includes a padding enclosed (between) an inner and
outer lining, wherein said shoe is of the rear entry type whereby
it has a rear opening extending perpendicular to the sole starting from
the top end of the upper up to near the sole area.Another problem of the rear-entry shoe lies in the fact that the shoe
tends to come out from the shell when the foot is removed.The aim of the present invention is then to carry out an inner shoe for
ski-boots which solves the above-mentioned problems and advantages and
in particular, allows an easy entry of the foot and has an high degree 
of flexibility so as to overcome the drawbacks explained with reference
to the cited prior art.This aim is reached by an inner shoe of the indicated type
having the features of claim 1. With reference to the preferred embodiment of the invention, a
strap is attached to the ski-boot at the rear opening of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Inner shoe for rear entry ski-boots, said inner shoe comprising a sole (18) and
an upper (16), a padding (24) being enclosed between an inner lining (26) and

an outer lining (28), a rear opening (20) extending from the top end (22) of the
upper (16) to near the sole area and perpendicularly to the sole (18),

characterized in that said padding (24) and one of said linings (26, 28) have at
least one slit (30, 32) provided in the front part of the inner shoe at the area

corresponding to the wearer's instep, the other of said linings (26, 28) being
elastic and spanning an otherwise open end of said at least one slit (30, 32) so as

to extend across the said end of the slit (30, 32).
Inner shoe according to claim 1, characterized in that said elastic lining is the
inner lining (26), said at least one slit (30, 32), made in the thickness of said

padding, has a closed path inside which said padding (24) is not provided with
said outer lining (28) at the end of said at least one slit opposite to said end

covered by said inner elastic lining (26), said upper (16) comprising an elastic
inserting member (34) covering said slit end where said outer lining (28) is not

provided.
Inner shoe according to claim 2, characterized in that said closed path of said at
least one slit (30, 32) has a substantially rectangular shape having the longer

sides longitudinally arranged.
Inner shoe according to claim 2, characterized by comprising two slits (30, 32)
concentric to each other, said elastic inserting member (34) externally covering

the portion of the padding (24) lying within the area defined by the outermost

slit (32), and thus the ends of the slits (30, 32) opposite to those covered by said
elastic lining (26).
Inner shoe according to claim 1, characterized in that said outer lining (28) on
each of the two side portions with respect to the longitudinal plane of the shoe is

provided with at least one lateral slit (36, 38).
Inner shoe according to claim 5, characterized in that each of said at least one
lateral slit (36, 38) has an elongated loop shape, the elongation extending

lenghtwise of the inner shoe towards the toe area (12) of the inner shoe. 
Inner shoe according to claim 5, characterized in that there are two of said
lateral slits (36, 38) which are concentric to each other.
