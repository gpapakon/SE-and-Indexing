<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to data processing and in 
particular to apparatus, systems and methods for implementing a memory 
embedded search arithmetic logic unit. As the tasks computing systems are required to perform increase in 
complexity, the burdens on the central processing unit (CPU), the size of the 
system memory, and the traffic on the system address and data buses all 
correspondingly increase. In particular, many types of tasks associated with 
speech synthesis, image signal processing, and digital signal processing 
require repetitive performance of basic computing operations in order to treat 
the data stored in memory. For example, many times it becomes necessary to 
search through a set organized data occupying a substantial amount of 
memory. In conventional systems, such a search can take up valuable CPU 
time, increase the traffic on the system data and address buses, and 
generally reduce operating efficiency.  According to the invention, an inactive memory is provided which has 
a data memory including rows and columns of storage locations for holding 
data. A broadcast memory including rows and columns of storage locations 
for holding instructions is also provided. Search circuitry operable to receive 
at least one word of data from the data memory tests the word against a 
preselected search test condition. Control circuitry operable in response to 
control instructions received from the broadcast memory controls the transfer 
of the word of data from the data memory to the search circuitry and the test 
of the word by the search circuitry. According to other embodiments of the invention, the search circuitry 
is operable to test the word of data retrieved from the data memory by 
applying a branch condition selected from a set of branch conditions defined 
by search instructions set held in the broadcast memory. Apparatus, systems and methods employing the concepts of the 
present invention efficiently handle computationally intensive applications 
such as searches through data stored in memory. Such apparatus, systems 
and methods ease CPU tasks burdens, minimize the amount of memory 
required and efficiently use bus band width. Further, such an apparatus, 
systems and methods are preferably compatible with currently available 
device and system configurations. For a more complete understanding of the present invention, and the 
advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following descriptions 
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:
