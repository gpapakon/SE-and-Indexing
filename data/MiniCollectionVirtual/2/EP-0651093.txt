<ABSTRACT>
A paper coating composition is provided having a clay-containing 
pigment system, a binder, a polysaccharide thickener, and at least 

0.005% to 2%, based upon the weight of the polymer, of a blocking 
agent that serves to prevent more than 25% of the polysaccharide 

thickener from being adsorbed onto the clay pigment surface. This 
coating is applied to raw paper for producing a high quality paper 

with smooth and substantially free of indentations surfaces for good 
ink to paper transfer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
coated paper and
a paper coating composition
utilizing nonionic thickeners and in particular a paper
coating composition having a clay-containing pigment system
which shows improved coating efficiency and runnability and
which shows only minimal pigment shock.In order to obtain high quality paper, it is necessary
that the surface of the paper be smooth and substantially free
of indentations or valleys. Smooth papers are a prerequisite
for good images printed thereon and also for good transfer of
ink to paper. Smooth papers are obtained by coating the raw
paper surface with a pigment composition. The coating
composition to effect this is an aqueous dispersion comprising
mainly of mineral pigments such as clay, calcium carbonate, or
titanium oxide, and pigment binders of natural protein, for
example, casein or soy protein, starch, or synthetic polymer
emulsions. Coating compositions are usually applied to a
continuous web of material by high speed coating machines,
such as blade coaters, air knife coaters, rod coaters and roll
coaters. The flow properties of coating color compositions
for paper and boards are of significant importance with regard
to the runnability (or flow) of the color during the coating
operation. These flow properties are often controlled by a 
"thickener" or "co-binder", which terms are taken to be
synonymous in the industry.In preparing the coating color, the thickener is mixed
with the pigment slurry. This may result in what is known in
the industry as "pigment shock", due to a strong transient
adsorption of the thickener onto the pigment. This causes a
rapid increase in viscosity during the early stages of
thickener addition. This pigment shock may result in
flocculation of the pigment, pigment agglomeration, difficulty
in mixing due to momentary solidification of such a pigment
slurry, and in severe cases, complete coagulation. Industrial
practice cannot tolerate such a phenomenon. Furthermore, when
this occurs, the thickener is rendered partially inactive,
resulting in less water retention and unsatisfactory rheology
before, under, and after the blade. As a consequence,
corrective actions during the coating operation are often
necessary.US-A-4,879,336 discloses an approach to solving
the above mentioned problem of pigment shock by mixing clay
slurries with a butadiene styrene latex composition when
certain poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymers are present in the
latex. Another approach to the problem is mentioned in US-A-3,558,543 that discloses a method of
