<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing parts, in particular consisting of plastic or containing plastic, with painted surfaces (2), if appropriate in different colours. The essence of the invention is that a film (5) is used as the substrate (26) for at least one coat of paint (12) and is arranged together with the coat of paint (12) on the part (3, 3', 3'') to be painted.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing parts, in particular
consisting of plastics or containing plastics, having

painted areas (2) of different colours, wherein a
backing film (5) is used as the support for at least

one coat (12) of paint disposed on a coupling agent
(8) and is arranged together with the paint coat (12)

on the part (3, 3', 3") to be painted, 
characterised
in that
 a biaxially stretched polyester film, an
aluminium film or an aluminised polyester film is used

as the backing film.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the backing film (5) carrying the paint coat (12) is
arranged directly on the part (3) to be painted.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the backing film (5) carrying the paint coat (12) is
arranged on an additional support and is

arranged/attached on/to the part (3, 3', 3") to be
painted together with the additional support (24).
A process according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

a metallic support (24) is used as the additional
support.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the plastics part (3', 3") to be

painted comprises at least one recess (25) and/or a
window (27) and in that the metallic support (24),

with the backing film (5) carrying the paint coat
(12), is inserted into the recess (25) and/or the

paint film (1, 1') is inserted into the window (27)
and attached therein. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised by
 use of the backing film (5) coated
with paint (4) for painting trim strips.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised by
 use of the backing film (5) coated
with paint (4) for painting impact protection strips.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised by
 use of the backing film (5) coated
with paint (4) in the painting of bumpers.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised by
 use of the backing film (5) coated
with paint (4) for painting whole car body parts.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised by
 use of the backing film (5) coated
with paint (4) in the painting of domestic appliances

and/or parts (3) intended for the building industry.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that
 the paint film (1, 1') is
thermoformed and then provided with injection-moulded

or foamed backing in a mould.
A paint film, in which a paint coat (12) is disposed
with the aid of a coupling agent (8) on a backing film

(6) serving as a support, 
characterised in that
 the
backing film (6) is a biaxially stretched polyester

film, an aluminium film or an aluminised polyester
film.
A paint film according to claim 12, 
characterised by

the following structure, consisting of individual
layers:
