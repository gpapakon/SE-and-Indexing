<ABSTRACT>
Measurement of the acoustical resonances in eggs (12) is shown to provide a rapid, noninvasive technique for their characterization. A piezoelectric transducer (10) provides mechanical excitation to the egg (12). The amplitude of vibration generated in the egg is detected by a piezoelectric transducer (14). The technique is sensitive to yolk puncture, shell cracks, and the presence of Salmonella bacteria, and may be sensitive to other yolk properties and to egg freshness. Remote characaterization, potentially useful for characterizing large numbers of eggs, has been demonstrated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR NONINVASIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF EGGSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is the result of a contract with the Department of Energy (Contract No. W-7405-ENG-36) . It relates generally to a noninvasive, nondestructive, and rapid technique for characterizing eggs, and more particularly to the measurement of acoustic resonances in eggs for characterization and quality control.Currently, the characterization of eggs is performed manually. For example, the identification of fertilized eggs or eggs having double yolks is accomplished by "candling" where a bright light source is placed behind an egg, and the shape of yolk portion determined by a human observer. Additionally, it would be of significant economic value if a technique were available for automated, remote, noninvasive determination of shell thickness, strength, and integrity as an aid to egg packaging. Moreover, egg freshness and contamination are of considerable concern for public health reasons. As an example, the present technique used for determining the presence of Salmonella in eggs involves a yolk culturing process which requires several hours.In U.S. Patent No. 5,062,296, entitled "Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy," which issued to Albert Migliori on November 5, 1991, the inventor describes the use of 

 resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, and more specifically, resonant response spectra derived from ultrasonic excitation of objects, to characterize objects. Ultrasound characterizes excitation frequencies beyond human hearing, or above 20 kHz. Since such high frequencies are absorbed or severely attenuated by organic materials, especially when liquid systems are involved, the teachings of the Migliori patent are reasonably directed to solid materials.An elastic thin shell of revolution possesses many modes of vibrations that are commonly referred to as the resonant modes or resonant frequencies. If the shell is mechanically excited at frequencies that coincide with these resonant frequencies, the resulting large amplitude vibrations of the shell body can easily be detected. At other frequencies, that is, away from resonance, the vibrational response of the shell is minimal.Most experimental acoustical studies to date have relied on artificially made resonators. Eggs represent a class of resonators in which a sturdy, but thin, shell completely surrounds fluid contents. The vibrational modes of an eggshell are modified by the physical properties of the egg white and yoke.Accordingly, it is an object of the
