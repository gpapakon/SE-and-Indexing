<DESCRIPTION>
 FELINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS VACCINESThis application relates generally to the field of veterinary vaccines, and more specifically to compositions and methods for preventing persistent infection in felines caused by feline leukemia virus.Background of the InventionFeline leukemia is debilitating viral disease of felines, particularly domestic cats, which can often result in death of the animal. The pathogenesis of feline leukemia can be divided into the following stages: primary disease, recovery or remission, and terminal illness. Generally, only cats which become persistently viremic will show significant clinical or hematological signs of illness in the primary stage of infection. The clinical symptoms include varying degrees of fever, malaise, weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy and hematological abnormalities.Cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may appear asymptomatic or may manifest the symptoms of feline leukemia disease. Upon natural infection, about 40% of the cats mount a humoral immune response against FeLV, rejecting the virus and becoming immune. When death occurs in the primary stage of infection, it is usually a direct consequence of severe bone marrow suppression and/or secondary infection. Although a carrier cat may remain asymptomatic throughout its lifetime, most of these animals will develop some FeLV-related illness.Diseases which are related directly to the effect of the virus upon FeLV carriers include neoplastic disease, bone marrow suppressive disorders, immunological disorders and reproductive problems. Indirectly related illnesses include viral and bacterial secondary infections and protozoal diseases.FeLV is usually transmitted by physical contact between infected and naive animals. Three subtypes of FeLV are associated with disease 

 in felines. Subtype A is present in 100% of all FeLV infections. When virus is isolated from a cat infected with FeLV, 50% of the time FeLVA is found alone, 49% of the time FeLVA is found together with FeLVB, and only 1% of the time is an infection found to be caused by FeLV subtypes A, B and C together. The virus is highly unstable in the environment, rarely surviving more than a few hours at room temperature, and can be inactivated with most disinfectants.There are a number of known vaccines for FeLV [see, e.g. Jarrett, "The Development of Vaccines Against Feline Leukemia", in Origins of Human Cancer, pp. 1215-1222 (1977) and Pinter et al, Virol., 83:417-422 (1977)]. However, these known vaccines do not elicit consistent antibody

3. The cell line according to claim 1 wherein said FeLV subtype is selected from the group consisting of FeLV subtype A, FeLV subtype B and FeLV subtype C.
4. An FeLV subtype protein produced by culturing in a suitable culture medium a stable feline T cell lymphoma cell line infected with at least one FeLV subtype and isolating said protein from a cell lysate or said culture medium, said cell line characterized by the absence of Feline Oncornavirus Cell Associated Membrane Antigen.
5. The protein according to claim 4 wherein said cell line is further characterized by the retention of T cell CD4 and CD8 antigens on the membrane of the cells.
6. A vaccine for protecting against disease caused by more than one strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) which comprises an effective amount of an FeLV antigenic protein produced by a stable feline T cell lymphoma cell line infected with at least one FeLV subtype in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, said cell line characterized by the absence of Feline Oncornavirus Cell Associated Membrane Antigen.
7. The vaccine according to claim 6 wherein said cell line is further characterized by the retention of T cell CD4 and CD8 antigens on the membrane of the cells. 


 8. The vaccine according to claim 6 wherein said FeLV subtype is selected from the group consisting of FeLV subtype A, FeLV subtype B and FeLV subtype C.
9. The vaccine according to claim 6 comprising additional feline leukemia viral antigenic proteins, said vaccine capable of protecting against infections with different strains of feline leukemia virus.
10. The vaccine according to claim 6 wherein the antigenic protein is derived from the cell membrane of said cell line.
11. A vaccine for protecting against disease caused by more than one strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) which comprises an effective amount of inactivated stable feline T cell lymphoma cells infected with at least one FeLV subtype in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, said cell fine characterized by the absence of Feline Oncornavirus Cell Associated Membrane Antigen.
12. The vaccine according to claim 11 wherein said cell line is further characterized by the retention of T cell CD4 and CD8 antigens on the membrane of the cells.
13. The vaccine according to claim 11 wherein said FeLV subtype is selected from the group consisting of FeLV subtype A, FeLV subtype B and FeLV subtype C.
14. The vaccine according to claim 11 comprising additional feline leukemia viral antigenic proteins, said vaccine capable of protecting against infections with different strains of feline leukemia virus.
15. A method of preventing the clinical symptoms of feline leukemia comprising administering to a naive feline an effective amount of a vaccine of claims 6 or 11.
16. A method of enhancing the immune response to a selected non-FeLV feline vaccine by concurrently or sequentially administering to a feline an effective amount of a vaccine of claims 6 or 11.
