<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
production of N-substituted polyhydroxy nitrogen-containing
heterocycles and intermediates for their
production. In one aspect, this invention relates to a
process for production of N-substituted polyhydroxy
piperidines based on N-substituted mannosamines,
allosamines and altrosamines, N-substituted polyhydroxy
pyrrolidines, N-substituted polyhydroxy azetidines and
intermediates for their production.A process for the preparation of 1-deoxynojirimycin
in which 1-amino-1-deoxyglucitol is
oxidized microbiologically to give 6-aminosorbose, which
is then hydrogenated with a catalyst to give
1-deoxynojirimycin is disclosed in United States Patent
Number 4,246,345. However, the yields of this process,
in particular the low volume yields in the
microbiological reaction are related to degradation
problems and short reaction times, in addition no
process for production of N-substituted derivatives of
1-deoxynojirimycin is disclosed.It is known that N-substituted derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin
can be made by protecting
aminosorbitols with protecting groups which are stable
in subsequent microbial oxidations. The protecting
groups can subsequently be removed by catalytic
hydrogenation. Such a process is disclosed in United
States Patent Number 4,266,025. In the '025 patent,
protected amino sugars are oxidized microbiologically to
give protected 6-aminosorboses, which are then isolated.
The protective group is then removed by catalytic
hydrogenation and the ring is reclosed to form the N-substituted 
derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin. However,
the '025 process is a complex process with multiple
reaction steps and requires a large amount of catalyst
in the hydrogenation step. In addition, the unprotected
6-aminosorboses cannot be isolated as such.United States Patent Number 4,405,714 discloses a
process for producing N-substituted derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin
in which glucose is converted into a 1-amino-1-deoxyglucitol.
The 1-amino-1-deoxyglucitol is
then protected by a protecting group which is stable in
the subsequent microbiological oxidation process. The
protecting group can then be removed under acid
conditions. The compounds are oxidized microbially to
give a protected 6-aminosorbose. The protective group
on the 6-aminosorbose is then removed under acid
conditions. The 6-aminosorbose salt thus obtained is
hydrogenated with a catalyst to give the N-substituted
derivative of 1-deoxynojirimycin. The '714 process,
like the '025 process, is a multistep process which
