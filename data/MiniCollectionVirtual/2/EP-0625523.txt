<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cis-oxalato(trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanediamine)
Pt(II) complex having high optical purity which may be
employed as starting material of carcinostatic substance and a process of
preparing same.US 4, 169, 846 relates to the preparation of Cis-Pt (II) complexes of 1,2- diaminocyclohexane (DAC), starting from optically purified DAC obtained from the precipitation of DAC-Nickel complexes.Trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanediamine can be obtained by reacting trans-dl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine
with tartaric acid to form diastereomers and optically
resolving the respective diastereomers by means of a recrystallization method
utilizing the difference of solubilities of the respective diastereomers.
However, this method possesses a limitation because the solubility difference
is not large so that it is reported that optical purity of 99.5 % or more
cannot be industrially attained.Accordingly, in order to obtain a platinum complex represented by Formula
1 having high optical purity, after the resolution of cis-trans stereoisomers
of 1,2--cyclohexanediamine which is starting material for the preparation of
the platinum complex in accordance with a resolution refining process 

(Japanese patent publication No.61-4827), the optical resolution of the trans
isomer is conducted by, in accordance with a normal process, forming a
diastereomer by means of tartaric acid followed by its recrystallization. A
platinum complex prepared by employing this resolved isomer is further
optically resolved by means of high performance liquid chromatography
(hereinafter referred to as "HPLC method") to produce the platinum complex
(Formula 1) having the high optical purity (US 5 338 874
and EP0 567 438). The optical
resolution of the final product is conventionally required because the
resolution and refining of the trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanediamine is insufficient.
Since the trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanadiamine is the important starting material of
cis-oxalato(trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanadiamine) Pt(II) complex which is the
starting material of a carcinostatic agent, the trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanediamine
having stably higher optical purity has been required.The platinum complex (Formula 1) has been synthesized in accordance with
a preparation process shown as the below equation (Formula 2).Many optically active pharmaceuticals may have a considerable difference
in carcinostatic activities and their side effects due to their isomerism so
 
that their optical purity is important when they are utilized as the
pharmaceuticals.In these
