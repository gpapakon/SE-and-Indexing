<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
for developing an electrostatic latent image into a toner 
image in an image-forming machine such as an electrostatic 
copying machine or a laser printer. More specifically, 
the invention is concerned with an apparatus for 
developing an electrostatic latent image, which is 
equipped with a driven developing agent application means 
which holds the developing agent on the surface thereof 
and carries it onto a developing zone, and a limiting 
means which limits the amount of the developing agent held 
on the surface of the developing agent application means. In order to develop an electrostatic latent 
image into a toner image in an image-forming machine, as 
is well known, there has widely been used an apparatus for 
developing electrostatic latent, which is equipped with a 
developing agent application means constituted by a roller 
or an endless belt that is rotated in a predetermined 
direction. Being rotated in a predetermined direction, 
the developing agent application means moves passing 
through a developing agent-holding zone, a developing 
agent amount-limiting zone and a developing zone 
successively. In the developing agent-holding zone, the 
developing agent supplied in a suitable manner is held on 
the surface of the developing agent application means. In 
the developing agent amount-limiting zone, the limiting 
means acts on the developing agent held on the surface of 
the developing agent application means to limit its amount 
to be applied to a required amount. In the developing 
zone, the developing agent is applied onto the surface of 
an electrostatic latent image carrier such as a rotary 
drum, which has an electrostatic photosensitive material 
on the peripheral surface thereof, and electrostatic  
 
latent image formed on the surface of the electrostatic 
latent image carrier is developed into a toner image. In 
order to accomplish favorable developing, it is important 
that the developing agent is held in an accurately 
required amount and sufficiently uniformly in the 
direction of width on the surface of the developing agent 
application means by properly limiting the amount of the 
developing agent held on the surface of the developing 
agent application means by using the limiting means. Japanese Patent Publication No. 16736/1988 
discloses an apparatus for developing electrostatic latent 
image equipped with a limiting means which is constituted 
by an elastic rubber member that may be a synthetic rubber 
such as urethane
