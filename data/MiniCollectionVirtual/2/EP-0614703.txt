<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser is provided for dispensing the extrudable contents 
of a collapsible container (10) having a nozzle (22) through which 

the container can 
be discharged by collapsing the container (10). The dispenser is of a 

piston/cylinder device, with the piston (70) having a container-engaging 
face 

provided with a contoured structure of a predetermined configuration 
corresponding generally to a collapsing profile of the collapsible 

container (10). 
An elongated flexible valve device (128) is slidably mounted relative 

to the 
housing and includes a coupling end coupled directly to a trigger 

member (78) of 
the dispenser and a valve end (140) for opening and closing an opening 

in the 
housing which defines the cylinder of the device. The flexible valve 

device (128) 
is a band member of plastic material and is operatively associated with a 

mechanism for holding the valve open when a cover of the housing is 
removed and for automatically closing the valve when the cover is 

replaced. 
A pistol grip handle (98) and the trigger (78) of the dispenser are 

ergodynamically 
configured for ease of operation. A set of interchangeable stop 

cams (156) are 
provided for positioning between the trigger (78) and the pistol 

grip handle (98) for 
selectively determining a metered amount of material to be dispensed by the 

dispenser for each actuation of the trigger (78).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of dispensers and, 
particularly, to a dispenser for dispensing extrudable material and, further, 
to a dispenser including features for facilitating dispensing the extrudable 
contents of a collapsible container. Dispensers for dispensing a viscous or extrudable material have 
been proposed in a wide variety of designs, ranging from a common piston-type 
caulking gun found in any hardware store to small hand-held twisting 
devices for rolling up a tube of extrudable toothpaste. Dispensers for 
extrudable material even have been proposed for hydraulic actuation. 
Commonly, the extrudable material is dispensed from a cylindrical housing 
by an advancable piston. Other dispensers are designed for collapsible 
containers and employ roller mechanisms which take the place of the more 
common advancable piston. When used as hand implements, most such 
dispensers have one form or another of a pistol grip handle mechanism, 
along with a ratcheting or ratchetless device operatively associated with the 
handle for incrementally advancing the piston within the cylinder of the 
dispenser. The ratcheting device may be operated through a trigger member 
mounted adjacent the piston grip handle. Roller mechanisms, for instance, 
are more applicable for use with rather "stiff" collapsible containers and are 
not very effective for use with relatively "limp" containers because of  
 
jamming problems with the roller carriage, and the rollers are not effective 
when the extrudable material includes lumpy particles. Although dispensers of the character described for extruding 
viscous contents from collapsible containers have been proposed for many 
years, there still is a definite need for a much more effective dispenser than 
has heretofore been available. This has become particularly prevalent in 
dispensing fluid condiments, such as ketchup, mustard, tartar sauce and the 
like, from collapsible containers in high volume restaurants or other establishments. 
These collapsible containers commonly are called "pouches" and 
the viscous material is contained in a relatively thin or limp plastic container 
versus the more stiff containers for products such as grease, toothpaste and 
the like. In addition, whereas the prior art is directed to dispensing extrudable 
material from tubularly shaped collapsible containers, such pouches are 
generally rectangularly shaped and generally flat in configuration, with heat 
sealed hems about the periphery thereof. It would be very difficult
