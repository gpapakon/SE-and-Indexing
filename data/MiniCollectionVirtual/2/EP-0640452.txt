<ABSTRACT>
Shown and described is a tile-cutting device with an elongated base plate (1), having a tile-supporting surface (15) with breaking web (14), and a slide (7) which is displaceable on a horizontal guide (4) above the breaking web (14) and on which a bell-crank lever (8) having a cutting wheel (12), a breaker head (13) and an actuating arm (10) is pivotably mounted. So that narrow tiles can also be cut exactly and quickly, provision is made for the base plate (1) to be provided at one longitudinal side with a recess (18) which is open at the margin, has a width (B) sufficient to marginally enclose a tile to be cut and - as seen in plan view - projects up close to the path (19) of movement of the breaker head (13).

Tile-cutting device with a roughly oblong base-plate (1)
displaying a tile-supporting surface (15) with a breaking-ridge

(14) and with a slide (7), which can be pushed along
a horizontal guide (4) above the breaking-ridge (14), and

on which is mounted a rotatable angle-lever (8), displaying
a cutting wheel (12), a breaker-head (13) and an operating

arm (10), characterized in that the base-plate (1) is
equipped on one side of its length with a recess (18),

opening to the side edge, which is of a width (B)
sufficient for grasping, by its edge, a tile (17) which is

to be cut and which projects inwards
to the movement path (19) of the breaker-head (13).
Tile-cutting device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that between the recess (18) and a tile-backstop (16) on

the base-plate (1) a narrow area (20) of the base-plate is
left in order to support the tile to be cut.
Tile-cutting device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in
that this area (20) of the base-plate has a width of

several centimetres, for example two to three centimetres.
Tile-cutting device as claimed in Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the recess (18) is delimited by an

edge area (21) running essentially perpendicular to the
length of the base-plate (1) and by an edge area (22)

inclined at an angle to the length of the base-plate (1)
and extending to the opposite end of the base-plate (1)

from the tile-backstop (16).
Tile-cutting device as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in
that the two edge areas (21,22) of the recess (18) run into

one another via an arc-shaped edge area (23).
Tile-cutting device as claimed in Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the edge areas (21, 22, 23) of the

recess (18) display bevelling (24) extending to the upper
side of the base plate (1). 
Tile-cutting device as claimed in one or more of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the long side (25) of the base-plate

(1) lying opposite the recess (18) projects outwards
beyond the breaking-ridge (14) only by an amount which is

roughly half the width of the breaker-head (13).
Tile-cutting device as claimed in one or more of Claims 1
to 7, characterized in that the corners of the base-plate

(1) lying on the recess (18) side are cut off diagonally to
below 45Â° approximately, the diagonal cut-off areas (26,

27) approaching roughly as near to the
guide (4) as does the recess (18).
