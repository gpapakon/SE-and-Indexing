<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a rack and pinion steering device having an 
annular stopper (22) made of synthetic resin which is inserted 

into a housing (5). The housing (5) contains a rack (4) meshing 
with a pinion which rotates according to steering operation. A 

reaction force acts on the stopper (22) so that the inward 
movement of the stopper (22) into the housing (5) is restrained. 

At least part of the reaction force acts on an end face (22c) of 
the stopper (22) when the stopper (22) restrains the rack (4) 

from moving into one direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rack and pinion 
steering device having a stopper for restraining the 
movement of the rack.  
 In WO-A-93/09991 there is disclosed a steering device which 
comprises: a piston rod; a cylinder housing containing the piston 
rod and being provided with a step on the inner circumference of the 
housing; a bushing inserted into the housing to support the piston 
rod and being provided with a step on the outer circumference 
thereof;  
 
an annular stopper made of synthetic resin, which is 
inserted into the housing so as to be positioned external to the 
bushing; and means for enabling a reaction 
force to act on the stopper so that the inward movement of the 
stopper into the housing is restrained. At least part of the 
reaction force acts on an end face of the stopper when the 
stopper restrains the piston rod from moving into one direction. 
However, the stopper tends to fracturing and failure due to 
stress concentrations and definiency of strength.  
 Fig.22 shows a part of a conventional hydraulic 
power steering device. The steering device comprises a 
rack 101 in mesh with a pinion that rotates according to 
steering operation, a housing 102 containing the rack 
101, a bushing 104 for sealing one end of an oil chamber 
103 formed in the housing 102, and an annular stopper 105 
which is inserted into the housing 102 so as to be 
positioned external to the bushing 104. Hydraulic oil 
fed into the oil chamber 103 for generating steering 
assist force exerts oil pressure on the bushing 104 to 
direct the bushing 104 to the outward direction from the 
housing 102. The outward movement of the busing 104 from 
the housing 102 caused by the oil pressure is restrained 
by the stopper 105. A member such as a ball joint is 
integrated with the rack 101 so as to be positioned 
external to the housing 102. The member integrated with 
the rack 101 is contacted with the stopper 105 so that  
 
the stopper 105 can restrain the rack 101 from moving 
into one direction (into the right in the Fig.22), and 
thus the stroke of the rack 101 into the one direction is 
controlled to a settled range. There is a clearance t 
between the bushing 104 and the stopper 105 to assure 
tolerance for assembly. The stopper 105 is conventionally made of sintered 
metals. To restrain the movement of the stopper 105, a 
ring member 106 such as a circlip is fitted in both of 
a circumferential groove 102a formed on the inner 
circumference of the housing 102 and a circumferential 
groove 105a formed on

A rack and pinion steering device comprising: 

a rack (4) meshing with a pinion (3) which rotates 
according to steering operation; 
a housing (5) containing the rack (4) and being 
provided with a step (5') on the inner circumference of the 

housing (5); 
a bushing (30) inserted into the housing (5) to support 
the rack (4) and being provided with a step (30') on the 

outer circumference thereof; 
an annular stopper (22) made of synthetic resin and 
being inserted into the housing (5) so as to be positioned 

external to the bushing (30); 
a ring member (23) engaged with both of the stopper 
(22) and the housing (5) to restrain the stopper (22) from 

moving outwardly from the housing (5) whereas the stopper 
(22) is allowed to move inwardly into the housing (5) 

relative to the ring member (23); 
means for enabling a reaction force to act on the 
stopper (22) so that the inward movement of the bushing (30) 

into the housing (5) is restrained by the engagement between 
both of the steps (5', 30') and the inward movement of the 

stopper (22) into the housing (5) is restrained via the 
bushing (30); 
 
   wherein at least part of the reaction force acts on an 

end face (22c) of the stopper (22) when the stopper (22) 
restrains the rack (4) from moving into one direction.  

 
A rack and pinion steering device according to claim 1, 
wherein:
 
   the bushing (30) has a chamfer (30a) on its end face 

which faces the stopper (22);
 
   the stopper (22) has a projection (61) on its end face 

which faces the bushing (30);
 
   the space between the chamfer (30a) and the housing (5) 

is filled by the projection (61) when the inward movement 
of the stopper (22) into the housing (5) is restrained via 

the bushing (30), and
 
   the stopper (22) having a portion (40, 41, 43, 47, 56, 

57 or 58), which is pressed by the ring member (23) so as 
to deform elastically when the inward movement of the 

stopper (22) into the housing (5) is restrained.
