<ABSTRACT>
A method for relief or prevention of a withdrawal syndrome resulting from addiction to a drug or substance of abuse and/or for the suppression of dependence on drugs or substances of abuse which comprises administering an effective amount of bisphenylalkylpiperazines of formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new use of certain
pyridyl- and pyrimidyl-substituted bisphenylalkylpiperazines
in the treatment of substance abuse disorders. More particularly,
this invention relates to the amelioration of withdrawal
symptoms and to modify drug-seeking behaviour.Drug dependency is extremely difficult to escape. This
is true whether the dependency is one based on ethanol,
amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, nicotine,
opioids, and phencyclidine or the like. There is a need,
therefore for an agent decreasing or overcoming such addiction
and, if possible reducing or eliminating the symptoms related
to the withdrawal of such drugs or substances of abuse.Different classes of neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters
in the brain have been implicated in the complex
mechanisms underlying for example the compulsive drinking of
alcohol. Experimental findings have favoured the opioid,
dopaminergic, serotonergic, and benzodiazepine receptor
subtypes.Based upon a large number of genetic and pharmacological
studies, serotonin (5-HT) containing neurons in the limbic-midbrain
and limbic-forebrain pathways are seemingly involved,
in part, in the fundamental mechanisms underlying for example
alcohol drinking.A number of reports have established that 5-HT uptake
blockers significantly attenuate ethanol intake in rats. For
example, zimelidine (The Merck Index 11th Ed., No. 10024) was
found to have a potent inhibitory effect on voluntary ethanol
consumption in rats. In human trials, zimelidine was shown to
increase the number of abstinent days and to produce a slight
reduction in the number of daily drinks. There is ample evidence 
that serotonin is involved in the regulation of both
food and fluid intake. Zimelidine was found to attenuate the
ingestion of food and alcohol concomitantly. It is possible,
therefore, that zimelidine's action is mediated through more
global effects on consummatory behaviour rather than specific
effects on ethanol reinforcement.Buspirone (The Merck Index 11th Ed., No. 1493), a partial
5-HT1A agonist, has been found to be effective for the treatment
of anxiety. Buspirone was reported to attenuate significantly
the consumption of alcohol by monkeys. In a clinical
trial comparing buspirone to placebo in alcohol-dependent
individuals, there was a lower drop-out rate in the buspirone-treated
group, which also reported fewer signs of craving.Amperozide (The Merck Index 11th Ed., No. 612), a 5-HT2
antagonist, was reported to significantly attenuate the intake
of
