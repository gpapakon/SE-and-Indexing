<ABSTRACT>
A chair for medical use comprising a base (1) 
supporting a seat (2) to which seat (2) a backrest 

and a legrest (4) are hinged. Movement and 
adjusting means (5) of the seat (2) are hinged 

between the base (1) and the seat (2) and comprise 
a first four-bar linkage (6, A-B-C-D) and a second 

four-bar linkage (7, C-D-E-F) of the same length 
and constrained to each other at a common smaller 

side (C-D). The first bar linkage (6) is 
connected at a remaining smaller side (A-B) to the 

base (1) and can move by an angle alpha, while the 
second bar linkage (7) is constrained by a 

remaining smaller side (E-F) to an end of the seat 
(2). Two bidirectional kinematic connectors (8) 

are positioned between the first and the second 
bar linkages (6 and 7) and are each solid to one 

large side (A-D, F-C) of the bar linkages (6, 7) 
so as to determine at an angle alpha of the first 

bar linkage (6) an angle 2 alpha between facing 
large sides (B-C, E-D) of the two bar linkages (6, 

7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an adjustable chair for 
use in the field of medicine, especially 
dentistry. The chair exhibits three basically flat 
portions, namely a backrest, a seat and a legrest, 
which are hinged in sequence. Chairs with three portions, very commonly used in 
the medical field, usually offer a wide range of 
positional adjustments, necessary for the needs of 
the medical professional who by adjusting the 
portions perform his or her operations comfortably 
and without the patient's having to strike awkward 
postures. Some types of prior art chair (see US patent US 
3,414,324 or GB patent GB 2,016,915) envisage that 
the seat be indirectly connected to a base, 
whereat are situated appropriate adjustment 
controls of the hydraulic kind (a classic 
vertically-arranged piston) which are activatable 
from the outside, directly by the doctor. These 
controls adjust the chair height and are aided in  
 
this task by the presence of a pantograph 
positioned bilaterally to the said means and 
constrained at one end to the chair and at the 
other to the base. Also present is a pair of 
motorised worm-nut groups, placed horizontally 
below the chair and permitting of inclining (with 
respect to the floor) both the chair and the 
backrest and legrest, being linked to relative 
independent articulations placed at the ends of 
the chair surfaces. Such solutions as the one described above are now 
obsolete since they provide only limited movement 
possibilities, the range of height adjustments 
from minimum to maximum depending on the excursion 
range of the piston and the mass of the chair 
itself, which can hamper the work of the doctor or 
dentist. One solution, FR 2,339,390, attempts to increase 
movement range while reducing the mass of the base 
in constraining an end of the surface defining the 
seat of the chair to the base by means of a 
motorised four-bar linkage. This solution actually 
increases the height range of the chair, bringing 
the patient's head to a height whereat the doctor 
or dentist can operate comfortably, as well as  
 
enabling the chair to be brought down to a height 
which presents no difficulty to even the shortest 
patient when climbing into or out of it. A similar technical improvement can be seen in 
patent DE 2,809,269: here, as above, the four-bar 
linkage principle is used, but is applied to the 
front end of the seat, near to where it is hinged 
to the legrest. This means that the entire chair 
can be rotated without the angular configuration 
of its constituent

An adjustable chair for use in the field of medicine, 
and in particular in the field of dentistry, 

comprising a base (1) of a seat (2) to which seat (2) 
are hinged a backrest (3) and a legrest (4); movement 

and adjustment means (5) being provided for at least 
the seat (2) and being hinged to the base (1) and to 

an end of the seat (2), the movement and adjusting 
means (5) being provided with motorisation (9) and 

having a function of raising and lowering the seat 
(2) between a minimum and a maximum heights with 

respect to a reference plane (P) on which the base 
(1) rests; the movement and adjustment means (5) 

being constituted by a first four-bar linkage (6, A-B-C-D) 
and a second four-bar linkage (7, C-D-E-F), 

both of the same length and constrained to each other 
at a common smaller side (C-D); the first bar linkage 

(6) being further connected at its end constituting 
another small side (A-B) to the base (1) and being 

mobile through an angle (alpha), and the second bar 
linkage (7) being constrained, by a remaining smaller 

side (E-F) to an end of the seat(2); two 
bidirectional kinematic connectors (8) being provided  

 
between the first (6) and the second (7) bar 

linkages, each bidirectional kinematic connector (8) 
being solid to a relative larger side (A-D, F-C) of 

the bar linkages (6, 7) such as to determine, at an 
angle (alpha) of the first bar linkage (6), an angle 

(2 alpha) which is twice the first (alpha) between 
facing larger sides (B-C, E-D) of the two bar 

linkages (6, 7), characterized in that the 
bidirectional kinematic connectors (8) are 

constituted by two pairs of enmeshed cogged sectors 
(10, 11); each said pair of enmeshed cogged sectors

representing an end point of the larger sides (A-D, 

F-C) of the respective bar linkage (6 or 7), and in

rod (20) hinged at one end to the end of the 

backrest (3) and at the other end being slidably 
inserted in a fork (21), which fork (21) has at 

its other end a second rod (22) hinged at its free 
end to an end of the legrest (4) such as to 

regulate the tilting of the legrest (4) to 
correspond with that of the backrest (3); a spring  

 
(23) being provided, acting between the first rod 

(20) and the fork (21), to keep the first rod (20) 
and the fork (21) close together. 
A chair as in claim 3, characterised in that tilt 
adjustment means (24) of the legrest (4) act

roller (29) which contacts a fixed striker (30) 

exhibited by the second bar linkage (7) when the 
seat (2) is at a minimum height, such as to cause 

a rotation of the first arm (25) and thus tilt the 
legrest (4). 
A chair as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
legrest (4) is solid to an arched support  

 
structure (31) developing beneath the front end of 

the seat (2) and exhibiting a straight portion
