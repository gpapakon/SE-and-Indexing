<ABSTRACT>
A fibrous preform constituting the fibrous reinforcement of the article to be manufactured is produced by forming a fibrous texture and consolidating it by a liquid route. An interphase layer between fibres and matrix is formed on the consolidated preform before densification by the matrix, so that the densification of the consolidated preform can be carried out without support tooling.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a part made of composite material
comprising fiber reinforcement densified by a matrix, the method comprising

the steps of :

making a fiber preform that is consolidated by impregnating a fiber
fabric c
omprising threads by means of a liquid precursor of a consolidating
material, shaping the impregnated fiber fabric, and transforming the

precursor into a consolidating material so as to obtain a consolidated
preform that is capable of retaining its shape without being held in tooling,
forming an interphase layer by depositing an interphase material
within the consolidated preform, and
densifying the consolidated preform provided with the interphase
layer by the matrix-constituting material of the composite material,

characterised in that the fiber preform is consolidated in such a
manner as to bond the threads of the fiber fabric together while allowing

access to the surface of the fibers constituting the threads, and the
interphase layer is formed by chemical vapour infiltration such that the

interphase material is deposited on the fibers within the threads of the
consolidated preform, and densification of the consolidated preform

provided with the interphase layer is performed by a matrix of silicon
carbide.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
interphase layer is formed by chemical vapour infiltration until it reaches a

thickness lying in the range 0.03 µm to 3 µm.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the
preform is made from a fiber fabric made up of carbon fibers.
