<ABSTRACT>
A drug carrier which is capable of being 
selectively accumulated on an injured portion of 

vascular endothelium comprises a compound having a site 
of positive charge which is exposed on the surface of 

the drug carrier, and preferably a hydrophobic

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drug carrier which is
capable of being selectively accumulated on an injured
portion of vascular endothelium, as well as capable of
carrying therein a drug for diagnosing or treating that
injured portion.An injury to a blood vessel, in particular to
endothelium of the aorta is generally known to give rise to
an excessive proliferation of blood vessel smooth muscle
cell, and to become one of the causes of hardening of the
arteries (R. Ross et al, N. Engl. J. Med., 314,488 (1986)).
This injury may be caused for example by the formation of a
thrombus, or by a peroxidation reaction in the blood
vessel. With the recent development of treatments for
enlarging a constricted portion of coronary by methods such
as physically pressing, cutting or burning the constricted
portion, there has been noticed a new problem. This is the
so-called restenosis, wherein the tissue injured by a
physical operation as mentioned above thickenes, thereby
constricting again a blood vessel which was enlarged by the
physical operation.This problem is very serious one because a method of
enlarging a constricted coronary by percutaneously
introducing a catheter into the blood vessel for physically
pressing the constricted portion (PTCA) is now extensively 
utilized as a treatment for ischemic cardiac disease such
as angina pectoris. Restenosis is now found in 30 to 50%
of patients after this physical treatment, as prevention of
restenosis has become very important to the overall success
of the PTCA method.Since this restenosis is found to be induced by an
excessive proliferation of blood vessel smooth muscle cells
an employment, a drug having the effect of inhibiting this
proliferation has been sought. However, none of the drugs
reported up to date to have exhibited satisfactory results
in a clinical test, though a large number of drugs are
reported to be effective in inhibiting the proliferation of
smooth muscle cell which have been cultivated on a Petri
dish (W. Cascells, Circulation, 86(3), 724 (1992)).One of the reasons for this ineffectiveness of such
drugs may be the fact that when these drugs are
intravenously or orally administered to a living body
generally, i.e. not locally, in an amount which would not
badly affect the body as a whole, it is very difficult to
cause such a sufficient density of these drugs to be
accumulated on the injured region of endothelium of a blood
vessel. For example, when heparin (which is effective in
inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cell) is to
be
