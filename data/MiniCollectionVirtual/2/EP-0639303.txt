<DESCRIPTION>
During the production of electric motor stators there 
is a requirement to compact the annular bundle of windings 
projecting from the end of the stator body into an envelope 
of predetermined size so that electrical clearances are 
maintained when parts are assembled to the end of the 
stator body. Traditionally the compacting has been carried 
out by a tool which is juxtaposed at the end of the stator 
and has radially movable shoes and an axial end ring for 
compacting the windings. In large volume production of 
small stators, the use of such tools is quite acceptable. 
However for larger size stators which are often produced in 
small numbers, it is generally uneconomical to provide 
large costly tools corresponding to each stator size, and 
indeed such large tools are extremely heavy and cumbersome 
to exchange when changing over from the production of one 
stator to that of another. Consequently it is not unusual 
for the windings of large size stators still to be formed 
and compacted manually, using a mallet. This obviously 
requires very skilled craftsmen and even then there is 
inevitable variation in the windings envelope from one 
stator to another. In accordance with the present invention, a device for 
compacting an annular bundle of windings projecting from 
the end of the body of a stator of an electric motor 
comprises an assembly of three 
rollers; a support for the stator, said support consisting 
of roller means for rotating the assembly and the stator 
body relatively to one another about the axis of the 
stator; the first one of the rollers extending, in use, 
into the bundle and being arranged to roll and compact the 
radially inner side of the bundle; a second one of the 
rollers extending, in use, along the outside of the bundle 
and being arranged to roll and compact the radially outer 
side of the bundle; and a third one of the rollers 
extending, in use, across the end of the bundle and being 
arranged to roll and compact the axial end face of the  
 
bundle, the three rollers being adjustable to accommodate 
stators of different sizes. Although the first and second rollers may be contoured 
and the progressive compaction of the bundle in the 
different directions achieved by moving the assembly of 
rollers and stator body axially of the stator body towards 
one another during compaction, means are preferably 
provided for advancing the first and second rollers 
radially outwardly and radially inwardly, respectively, of 
the stator, and the third roller axially of the

A device for compacting an annular bundle of windings 
projecting from the end of the body of a stator (9) of an 

electric motor, the device comprising 
an assembly of three rollers (18,20,22); 

a support for the stator (9), said support 
consisting of roller means 

(8) for rotating the assembly and the stator body 
relatively to one another about the axis of the stator; the 

first one (18) of the rollers extending, in use, into the 
bundle and being arranged to roll and compact the radially 

inner side of the bundle; a second one (20) of the rollers 
extending, in use, along the outside of the bundle and 

being arranged to roll and compact the radially outer side 
of the bundle; and a third one (22) of the rollers 

extending, in use, across the end of the bundle and being 
arranged to roll and compact the axial end face of the 

bundle, the three rollers (18, 20, 22) being adjustable to accommodate 
stators of different sizes. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein means 
(19,21,23) are provided for advancing the first (18) and 

second (20) rollers radially outwardly and radially 
inwardly, respectively, of the stator (9), and the third 

roller (22) axially of the stator, during the compaction. 
A device according to claim 2, wherein the means for 
advancing the rollers (18,20,22) are fluid operated rams 

(19,21,23). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein two second rollers (20) are provided, which are, in 

use, spaced apart around the outside of the bundle. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the stator body (9) is rotated by being placed with 

its axis horizontal in a cradle formed by a pair or pairs  
 

of rollers (8) which both support the stator body and 
transmit rotation to the stator body. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein two opposed heads (A,B) are provided, each with the 

three rollers (18,20,22), for forming both ends of the 
stator (9) simultaneously. 
A device according to claim 6, wherein the parts of 
the head (A,B) with the three compacting rollers (18,20,22) 

are swivelable away from one another to provide the space 
necessary for placing a stator (9) on, and removing it 

from, the cradle. 
A device according to claim 7, wherein one of the 
heads (A,B) is mounted on a carriage (4B) which is movable 

towards and away from the other head to accommodate stators 
of different axial length.
