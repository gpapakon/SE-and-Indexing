<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for casting (moulding) pieces of cast iron (cast-iron castings) by means of a steel collaborating casing (envelope) (1). This method consists in:   - producing a casing by means of the assembly and welding of steel sheets,   - arranging granular materials (aggregates) (12) around a casing,   - pouring the molten cast iron into the said casing (1), and - after cooling and solidification of the cast iron, removing the granular materials (12) in order to obtain a cast iron casting collaborating with the steel sheets.   Application to the production of containers for radioactive wastes, structural elements and biological protection.

<CLAIMS>
Process for casting parts made of metals having
high melting points, characterized in that it consists,

for each part to be cast:

in producing a collaborating form, or casing, (1)
by joining together metal sheets made of a first

metal;
in placing granulates (12) around the casing;
in pouring a molten second metal (3) into the
said casing;
in removing the granulates after the second metal
has cooled and solidified, the said solidified

second metal collaborating with the casing made
of the first metal in order to produce the part.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the production of the casing consists in welding

metal sheets into which the second metal is poured.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the production of the casing furthermore consists in

welding metal inserts (6, 8) onto some of the metal
sheets in order to keep the said metal sheets in a fixed

position, one with respect to the others.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the first metal is steel.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the second metal is cast iron.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the granulates are steel balls.
Process for casting containers for radioactive
waste, characterized in that it consists of a process 

according to any one of Claims 1 to 6.
