<ABSTRACT>
The system is based on the use of two bodies (1) and 
(2) provided with projections (3) staggered with recesses, 

complementary in both bodies to permit pressure coupling 
of both bodies (1) and (2), with the possibility of axial 

movement to enable disassembly thereof. The bodies (1) and 
(2) can be made out of any suitable material and form together 

the structure corresponding to a closure of a window, door 
or the like, in such a way that the body (1) will constitute 

the part considered as external and body (2) will form 
the internal part of that structure, any of them being interchangeable 

as they are removable. In the case of structures 
with a thermal bridge any of the bodies (1) and (2) or both 

of them can constitute that which is the thermal bridge and 
can be fastened to the sections that will constitute the 

internal and/or external parts. 
The possibility of this coupling of the bodies (1) and 
(2) permits any of the parts or bodies that form the closure 

to be interchanged, while the remaining ones are maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
As is expressed in the title of this specification, 
the present invention refers to a modular system for the 
formation of glass-enclosed closures, which may be: doors, 
windows, dividers, facades, furniture and/or any type of 
structure for purposes similar to those of the cited components. The basic characteristic of the modular system lies on 
the fact that the sole section that conventionally forms 
the structure of, for example, a door or window frame, is 
defined by two parts that can be coupled together, the 
coupling being defined by a special shape that permits assembly 
or disassembly to be carried out, thus enabling the 
interchange and thus the inside of the structure is of a 
certain color or material and the outside one is different. 
This system even permits the change to be made whenever one 
so desires, even in the event that the closure has been 
assembled for some time. Conventionally, steelwork closures, such as doors, 
windows, dividers, even facades, in the event of being 
simple closures, the structure or section on which the 
glass is mounted, is a single piece, in which the corresponding 
guides are formed, as well as the inside and outside 
surfaces of the section or structure itself. In the 
case of sections with a thermal bridge, there are logically 
two pieces, one that constitutes the inside part and the 
other that constitutes the outside part, with the insertion 
of the middle piece or pieces that define the thermal 
bridge itself. The fastening of these middle pieces constituting 
the thermal bridge with regard to the outside and inside 
sections, requires the use of some special pieces or machines 
to carry out the fastening or assembling between the  
 
different parts or pieces that constitute the structure, 
so that once the fastening or assembling has been carried 
out it is totally impossible to disassemble the same. Now then, for simple sections as well as for sections 
with a thermal bridge, irrespective of the assembly operations 
in the second case, the structure must be assembled 
at the factory and is taken to the installation site already 
assembled, which implies serious inconveniences when 
storage and transporation take place, due to the large space 
taken up by structures already mounted. Besides, due to the impossibility to disassemble the 
parts that make up the structure, the combination of materials, 
concerning colors as well as the nature of the same, 
is not possible, since a possible change inevitably requires 
the need to eliminate the original

Modular system for the formation of glass-enclosed 
closures, which are to be used in the formation of frames, 

leaves and the like, of doors, windows, dividers or any other 
structure formed by means of a metal section with the corresponding 

shape for assembling glass and sealing molding, 
in the case of simple structures, or else the structure is 

formed by two section between which there is a middle piece 
of a different material, defining a thermal break bridge, 

essentially characterized in that the metal section comprising 
the simple structure is formed by two bodies (1) 

and (2) that can be coupled together with a removable nature, 
said bodies (1) and (2) forming the internal part (5) and 

the external part (4) of the structure itself, the latter 
having the possibility to be interchanged with others by 

virtue of the removable nature of the bodies (1) and (2) 
that form them; with the particularity that said two bodies 

have their coupling fronts provided with complementary 
recesses and projections (3), which adjust and link together 

by pressure in order to permit their disassembly by 
axial movement of one body with regard to the other; it 

also being provided for that these coupling projections (3) 
and recesses are materialized antagonistically in both 

bodies, making the coupling reversible, reversing the 
positioning of the body in its arrangement on either side 

of the structure that they form. 
Modular system for the formation of glass-enclosed 
closures, according to claim 1, characterized in that in 

structures with a thermal break bridge, one of the two 
pieces or both of them which constitute the bridge is/are 

materialized by the body or bodies (1) and (2) which, being 
of a different material, have the corresponding coupling 

means formed by the complementary recesses and projections 
(3.) 
Modular system for the formation of glass-enclosed 
 

closures, according to the above claims, characterized in 
that the two bodies (1) and (2) of different material, for 

the formation of the thermal break bridge, provided with 
complementary coupling projections (3) and recesses, are 

linked to both sections (4'') and (5'') that are identical 
to each other or different from each other, forming the 

inside part (5) and outside part (4) of the structure. 
Modular system for the formation of glass-enclosed 
closures, according to the above claims, characterized in 

that the two bodies (1) and (2) that can be coupled of the 
simple structure are metallic. 
Modular system for the formation of glass-enclosed 
closures, according to the above claims, characterized in 

that the body constituting the thermal break bridge (1') 
is made of different material than the opposite body (2) and 

can be coupled to it, that body (1') being connected to a 
section (4') of a nature identical to or different from that 

of the opposite body (2) and forming the other section. 
Modular system for the formation of glass-enclosed 
closures, according to the above claims, characterized in 

that the two bodies (1) and (2) that can be coupled together 
that form the thermal break bridge have an identical or a 

different nature, and in both eases of a nature different 
from that of the sections (4'') and (5'') connected to them 

and constituting the inside part (5) and outside part (4) 
of the structure, said sections either being of the same 

or a different nature.
