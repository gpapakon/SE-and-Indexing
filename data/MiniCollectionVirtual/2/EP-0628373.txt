<ABSTRACT>
A component holder for a friction welding apparatus has 
upper and lower clamp members which can be urged towards 

each other in order to clamp between them a component to 
which second or further components are to be friction 

welded. The first component is held in the component 
holder substantially entirely by friction clamping 

forces. The component holder is particularly suited to 
use with friction welding apparatus in which the 

component holder is carried by an angularly reciprocable 
workpiece mounting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction 
welding. The invention concerns a component 
holder, for holding components 
to be welded, especially, but not necessarily exclusively, 
discs or drums to which blades are to be frictionally welded 
to make blisks or blums for a gas turbine engine. It is known that two components, even metal components can be 
welded together by reciprocating at least one of the 
components and urging the components together, the frictional 
heat generated between the components melting the material of 
at least one component, and more usually both components, so 
as to form a friction weld. A technique and apparatus for 
frictional welding of this kind is described in co-pending 
patent applications GB 9309824.2 and GB 9309865.5. One 
example of a technical field in which friction welding is 
currently seen as having useful applications is in the field 
of fabricating blisks and blums for compressors or turbines 
for aircraft engines. Compressor assemblies may comprise a 
blisk (blade plus integral disc), or a blum (blade plus 
integral drum) which is effectively several blisks joined 
together. Friction welding has practised for some time in a method in 
which one workpiece is mounted in a rotatable holder and 
another workpiece to which the first workpiece is to be 
joined is held non-rotatably. A method and apparatus of this 
kind is exemplified by US Patent No 3,896,986 which relates 
to the manufacture of a vehicle road wheel in which a drum-like 
rim portion is friction welded to a disc-like wheel 
centre. The disc-like centre is non-rotatably mounted co-axially 
with clamp means for holding the rim portion. This  
 
latter clamp means includes first and second clamp members 
movable relatively towards each other to hold the rim 
concentric with the axis of the wheel centre and the axis of 
rotation of the rim clamp means. However, the first and 
second rim clamp members comprise a plurality of part-circumferential 
chuck segments which are movable in radial 
directions to engage the inner and outer surfaces of the 
drum-like rim workpiece. The clamping forces and clamping 
directions are thus perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The present invention is also intended for the clamping of 
circular objects, such as the above mentioned compressor 
disc, but in contrast is intended to make the circumference 
of the disc available for the welding-on of radial 
components, for example air-flow compressor blades. The above 
mentioned practised technique is unsuitable for welding-on

<CLAIMS>
A component holder for holding a circular component 
during a friction welding operation comprising a 

first clamp member (53, Fig 3), a second clamp 
member (54) separable from the first member (53) to 

receive the circular component (11) to be welded 
between the clamp members (53,54), and clamp force 

means (66) operative, in use, to urge the two clamp 
members (53,54) towards each other and into 

engagement with the component (11) whereby the 
component is held between the clamp members by 

friction, characterised in that the clamp members 
(53,54) comprise circular shell-like structures 

disposed co-axially about an axis (12) and the clamp 
force means (66) is arranged to exert a clamp force 

in the direction of the axis (12) to urge the clamp 
members (53,54) to engage the component (11). 
A component holder as claimed in claim 1 
characterised in that the first clamp member (53) 

and the second clamp member (54) are adapted to 
engage a circular or annular component (11) around 

an outer annular peripheral region.

claim 2 further characterised by an annular clamping 

ring (59) interposed between at least one of the

A component holder as claimed in any preceding claim 
characterised in that one (53) of the clamp members 

comprises an assembly (60) including a force 
transmitting pressure plate (59) which is urged, in 

use, by clamp force generating means (66) towards  
 

the other clamp member (54) and into frictional

comprises a plurality of clamp force generating 
actuators.
