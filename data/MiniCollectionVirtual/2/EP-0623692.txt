<CLAIMS>
Process for separating organic contaminants, in
particular oils, from objects, characterized in that

the contaminated objects are subjected in a container
(1) to an inert gas, which has not been compressed to

its critical pressure or above, preferably nitrogen or
carbon dioxide, at a temperature of 100 to 500°C,

preferably 250 to 350°C, the contaminants are dissolved
in the inert gas and the inert gas loaded with the

organic contaminants is subsequently removed from the
container (1).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the inert gas is introduced under a pressure of

0.5 to 75 bar into the container (1).
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the inert gas loaded with the

organic contaminants is separated from the latter by
means of condensation of the contaminants.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the inert gas loaded with the

organic contaminants is separated from the contaminants
and is subsequently recycled at least partially to the

container (1) loaded with contaminated objects.
Process according to Claims 3 and 4,
characterized in that the inert gas is heated after the

contaminants have been condensed out.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that fresh inert gas is admixed to the inert gas after

the contaminants have been separated off. 
Process according to one of the preceding
claims for contaminated wastes, characterized in that

the wastes are comminuted before being filled into the
container (1).
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the wastes are comminuted in the deep-frozen state

after having been subjected to a refrigerant medium.
