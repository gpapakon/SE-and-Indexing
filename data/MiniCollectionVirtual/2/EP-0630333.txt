<ABSTRACT>
A steering device for a transport vehicle (1) with at least one front wheel (2, 3) and at least one rear wheel (4, 5), each wheel being suspended to pivot about a steering axis (6), which lies essentially perpendicular to the supporting surface on which the wheels (2, 3, 4, 5) are intended to roll. At least one of the front wheels (2, 3) is coupled via a front tie rod (7) to an operating means (12) in such a manner that pivot movements of the operating means (12) in one plane are converted via the front tie rod (7) into steering movements of the front wheel (2, 3). At least one of the rear wheels (4, 5) is coupled via a rear tie rod (8) to a transmission means (18), which is disposed to be actuated by movements of the operating means (12) to achieve steering movements in the rear wheel (4, 5). The transmission means (18) is coupled to the operating means (12) via a linkage system (16) for transmission of torsional movements of the operating means (12) to steering movements of at least one rear wheel (4, 5), independently of the pivot movements of the operating means (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a steering device for a transport 
vehicle with at least one front wheel and at least one rear 
wheel, each wheel being suspended for turning about a steering 
axis, essentially perpendicular to the supporting surface 
on which the wheels are intended to roll, in which device at least one of the 
front wheels is coupled via a front tie rod to an operating 
means in such a manner that pivot movements of the 
operating means in a plane are transmitted via the front tie 
rod to steering movements of the front wheel, and at least one of 
the rear wheels is coupled via a rear tie rod to a transmission 
means, disposed to be actuated by movements of the 
operating means to effect steering movements of the rear 
wheel. Four-wheeled transport vehicles with such steering devices are 
previously known (cf for example US-A-3 408 089), where the 
front wheels and the rear wheels are turned in different 
directions to facilitate taking sharp curves of short radii. 
When operating in confined spaces it can, however, be difficult, 
even with vehicles with this type of steering coupled 
to the front and rear wheels, to place and direct the vehicle 
in the desired manner. The purpose of the invention is to provide a steering device 
for a transport vehicle of the type described by way of 
introduction having improved maneuverability, and according 
to the invention this is achieved by virtue of the fact that 
the transmission means is coupled to the operating means via 
a linkage system for transmission of torsional movements of 
the operating means to steering movements of at least one 
rear wheel independently of pivotal movements of the operating 
means. Further developments of the steering device according to the 
invention are disclosed in the subclaims.  
 The invention will be described in more detail below with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate 
schematically different embodiments of the steering device 
according to the invention and in which 
fig 1is a perspective view of a steering device for a 
transport vehicle according to a first embodiment, 
where all the wheels are directly actuated by an 
operating means, fig 2is a perspective view of a steering device according 
to a second embodiment, where one front wheel and 
one rear wheel are directly actuated by the operating 
means and the other wheels are actuated by the 
movement of the vehicle, fig 3is a side view of a linkage system between the operating 
means and the transport vehicle according to 
fig 1 or

Steering device for a transport vehicle (1) with at least 
one front wheel (2,3) and at least one rear wheel (4,5), each 

wheel being suspended for turning about a steering axis (6), 
essentially perpendicular to the supporting surface on which 

the wheels (2,3,4,5) are intended to roll, in which device at least one of 
the front wheels (2,3) is coupled via a front tie rod (7) 

to an operating means (12) in such a manner that pivot movements 
of the operating means (12) in a plane are transmitted 

via the front tie rod (7) to steering movements of the front 
wheel (2,3), and at least one of the rear wheels (4,5) is 

coupled via a rear tie rod (8) to a transmission means (18), 
disposed to be actuated by movements of the operating means 

(12) to effect steering movements of the rear wheel (4,5), 

characterized
 in that the transmission means 
(18) is coupled to the operating means (12) in a linkage 

system (16) for transmission of torsional movements of the 
operating means (12) to steering movements of at least one 

rear wheel (4,5) independently of pivotal movements of the 
operating means (12). 
Steering device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the pivot movement of the operating means 
(12) takes place in a plane (C-D) which is essentially parallel 

to the supporting surface, and that the torsional movements 
(A-B) of the operating means (12) take place about its 

longitudinal axis. 
Steering device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the transmission means (18) comprises 
a shaft (19) which is rotatable in the longitudinal direction 

of the vehicle, on which said shaft and arm (20) are mounted. 
Steering device according to one or more of Claims 1 - 3, 

characterized
 in that the operating means (12)

rotatably mounted and is joined to the transmission means 
(18) via the linkage system (16).  

 
Steering device according to one or more of Claims 1 - 4, 

characterized
 in that the linkage system (16) 
comprises a first universal joint (21) and a second universal 

joint (22), which are coupled to each other via an inner 
steering portion (23), which is rotatably mounted in an outer 

steering portion (17), said outer steering portion (17) 
having at one end a first bearing means (24), which is journalled
