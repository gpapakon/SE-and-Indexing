<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting weight gain or inducing 
or facilitating weight loss comprising administering to 

a human an effective amount of a compound having the 
formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Western society places great emphasis on 
personal appearance and in particular one's weight. Diets 
and weight loss programs are extensively advertised and 
utilized by many people with varying degrees of success. 
There continues to be a search for new and effective means 
to facilitate weight loss. Obesity is the most prevalent, chronic, medical 
condition in our society. Being overweight or obese is 
directly or indirectly associated with a vast number of 
diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and gallstones, for example. Also, diminished 
self-image with consequent psychological maladjustments are 
linked to being overweight. As such, those who are 
overweight often experience more health problems and 
shortened life expectancies. This invention provides methods for inhibiting 
weight gain or inducing weight loss comprising 
administering to a human an effective amount of a compound 
of formula I 
   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 
wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;
 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 
pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino; and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. Also encompassed by the invention is a method of 
suppressing or inhibiting appetite which comprises 
administering to a human a compound of formula 1. The current invention concerns the discovery 
that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes 
(benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for 
inhibiting weight gain or inducing or facilitating weight 
loss, or inhibiting appetite. The methods of use provided 
by this invention are practiced by administering to a human 
a dose of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt or solvate thereof, effective to inhibit 
weight gain or induce weight loss, or inhibit appetite. 
The present method includes both medical therapeutic and/or 
prophylactic treatment, as appropriate. The term "inhibit weight gain or induce weight 
loss" is defined to include its generally accepted meaning 
which includes administration to a human subject to weight 
gain, and holding in check or reducing a human's weight. 
The term "inhibit appetite" includes suppression or 
reduction of appetite. Also encompassed by the invention 
is the treatment of an obese human, inducement of weight 
loss in a human of relatively normal weight, and the 
maintenance of weight control. Raloxifene, a preferred compound of this 
invention is the hydrochloride salt of a compound of
