<ABSTRACT>
A medical device has a flexible light guide (46) having a light energy input end (50) adapted for connection to a source of light energy (52) and a light energy output end (64). The device includes a tip (54) for contacting tissue to be treated by the device and irradiating the tissue with light energy. The tip (54) consists essentially of light-transmissive material and has a working region (68) for contacting and irradiating the tissue to be treated. The tip (54) has a recess (60) therein for receiving the output end (64) of the light guide (46). The output end (64) of the light guide (46) is at least partially surrounded by the light-transmissive material, and is positioned relative to the light-transmissive material so as to define an interface (62) therebetween. The interface (62) is in proximity to and in thermally-conductive relationship with the working region (68) of the tip (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical devices for use in
medicine and surgery in which the probe conveys light energy to tissue to be
treated by the probe. The present invention is preferably used in a contact
mode, in which the device directly contacts tissue to be treated. (As used
herein, the term "treated" means exposed to light energy for any purpose,
including but not limited to phototherapy, biostimulation, incision, vaporization,
coagulation, and the like.)Light energy, including but by no means limited to laser light
energy, has been used in medicine and surgery for many years. Different
wavelengths of light interact differently with tissue, so tissue effects are wave-length-dependent
Lasers in particular are used in many different types of
medical procedures. Different lasers cause different tissue effects, depending
upon the wavelength of the laser emission. Among the types of lasers used
in laser medicine are the CO2 laser, the KTP laser and the neodymium:YAG
laser.Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) lasers have been one of the most
popular lasers in laser medicine. The Nd:YAG laser is an efficient and
inexpensive source of high-power radiation in comparison to other types of 
lasers. Thus, cost-effective, high-power laser radiation can be made available
at the treatment site. In addition, the absorption coefficient of water, the
major constituent of tissue, is near its minimum at the fundamental wave-length
(1.06 Âµm) of the radiation from Nd:YAG lasers. As a result, the
radiation from an Nd:YAG laser penetrates deeply into tissue and is excellent
for coagulation. Indeed, Nd:YAG lasers were initially used solely for
coagulation. However, with suitably high power, laser radiation from
Nd:YAG lasers can also be made to vaporize tissue.In addition to laser light sources, which are referred to as
"coherent," non-laser or "incoherent" light sources may also be used for
medical and surgical procedures.In order to get the light energy from the light source to the
tissue to be treated, it is desirable to have a delivery system between the light
source and the operative site. Such delivery systems as used in medicine and,
in particular, in surgery can be broadly divided into those which either contact
or do not contact tissue to be treated. In non-contact delivery systems, the
distal end of the delivery system does not touch the tissue but, instead, uses
a fiber optic or other light guide means to conduct light energy to a location
adjacent, but not touching, the tissue. The light energy passes from the guide

<CLAIMS>
A medical device, comprising: (i) a flexible light guide (46), having a light
energy input end being adapted for connection to a source of light energy (52) and

having a light energy output end (64) from which a portion of the light energy input
into the light guide input end exits as a beam of light energy; and (ii) a tip (54)

having at least a distal end and side walls comprising a working region (68) which
contacts tissue to be treated by said device and both irradiates said tissue with light

energy and applies heat energy to said tissue, said tip:

(a) comprises light-transmissive ceramic material having high thermal
conductivity;
(b) has a bore (60) in said ceramic material, for receiving therein said output
end of said light guide and for at least partially surrounding said output end of said

light guide with said light-transmissive material; and
(c) defines an interface (62) between said output end of said light guide and
the light-transmissive material at least partially surrounding said output end;
(d) said interface enables at least a first portion of said light to be transmitted
into and through said light-transmissive material and at least a second portion of said

light to be converted to heat energy; characterized in that
(e) said interface further is located at or near the proximal boundary of the

heat energy generated at the interface is conducted to the working region (68) and
significantly raises the temperature of the working region for applying heat energy

directly to said tissue by contacting said tissue with said working region while also 
being sufficiently distant from the working region of said tip so as to allow at least a

portion of the beam of light energy transmitted through the light-transmissive material
to strike the side walls of the tip at first locations, reflect therefrom back into the tip,
