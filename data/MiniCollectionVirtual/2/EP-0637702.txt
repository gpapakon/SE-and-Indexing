<ABSTRACT>
The device for sealing a pressurised-hydraulic shock absorber tube (1) in which there slides a piston (7) provided with an axial rod (8), comprises a stopper (17), a seal (10), fastening means (19 to 22) and a guide disc (18), the central opening (18a) of which guides the axial movement of the rod (8). The disc has several perforations (24) distributed about a circular path at the bottom of an annular groove (23) made in at least one of the sides of the disc. The side of the disc has two concentric annular bearing surfaces (18b, 18c) separated by the annular groove and intended for the seals. The stopper (17) has a central opening (17a), the diameter of which is greater than the diameter of the rod of the tube so as to define a radial clearance preventing mechanical contact between the stopper and the rod during operation of the shock absorber. The stopper has a circular housing (17b) around its central opening to take part of the seal sandwiched between the stopper and the guide disc.

Sealing device for a pressurized hydraulic shock-absorber 
tube (1) in which a piston (7) provided with an 

axial rod (8) slides, the device comprising a cap (17), 
a seal (10), an expansion stop element (11, 18) and means 

(19 to 22) for fixing the sealing device in the tube, 
characterized in that the expansion stop element is made 

in the form of a disc (18) whose central opening (18a) 
guides the axial movement of the rod (8), the guiding 

disc having one or more perforations (24) distributed 
around a circular path, in order to ensure communication 

of the shock-absorber fluid between an expansion volume 
and the inside of the tube, the expansion volume being 

defined by the seal and the disc between two concentric 
axial-bearing rings (18b, 18c), and in that the cap (17) 

has a central opening (17a) whose diameter is greater 
than the diameter of the rod of the tube in order to 

define a radial clearance which prevents mechanical 
contact between the cap and the rod during operation of 

the shock absorber, the cap having a circular housing 
(17b) around its central opening in order to receive a 

part of the seal sandwiched between the cap and the 
guiding disc. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the guiding disc (18) has an annular groove (23) on 

at least one of the sides, the perforations (24) emerging 
in the bottom of the annular groove. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the annular groove (23) in the guiding disc (18) has 

a cross-section which is approximately trapezoidal or in 
the form of a V which flares outwards. 
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the inner annular surface (18c) of the guiding 

disc is set back axially with respect to the outer 
annular surface (18b) of the disc. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the seal (10) has an annular groove (10d) axially 

opposite the perforations (24) in the guiding disc.  
 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the guiding disc (18) has at least one side (18e) 

which is conical towards the inside and oriented so as to 
face the seal (10). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the guiding disc (18) has two 

identical sides. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the seal (10) is made as a single 

component made of elastomer. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the seal (10) consists of a static part 

(10a) in the form of a washer, which seals between the 
cap (17) and the inner wall of the shock-absorber tube 

(1), and of a dynamic part (10b) centred with respect to 
the static part and sealing between the cap and the rod 

(8) of the piston. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the diameter of the central opening 

(18a) in the guiding disc is greater than the diameter of 

the rod by a few hundredths of a millimetre to one tenth 
of a millimetre. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the diameter of the central opening 

(17a) in the cap is greater than the diameter of the rod 
by a few tenths of a millimetre. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the guiding disc (18) has a central 

bore in which a tubular guiding bush (18d) is mounted. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it furthermore comprises wiping 

means (25) which protect the radial clearance between the 
cap and the rod from the outside environment.
