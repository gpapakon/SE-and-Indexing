<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a filler head (cap) for a motor vehicle fuel tank filler pipe, of the type including a bowl-shaped body (12), the upper face (16, 20) of which includes a filler opening (24), and including a shut-off flap (30) mounted so it can pivot with respect to the bowl (12) between a position of rest towards which it is returned elastically and in which it closes off the filler opening (24) and a position in which it is retracted inside the bowl (12), in which position the filler opening (24) is free and towards which it is driven when a filler nozzle (150) is inserted into the filler opening (24), characterised in that it includes means (76, 96) for automatically locking the shut-off flap (30) in the position of rest, these means including a member (110) for unlocking it.

Filling head for a motor vehicle fuel tank filler pipe, of the 
type having a body in the shape of a bowl (12), the top face (16, 20) 

of which has a filling orifice (24), and having a closure flap (30) 
mounted so as to pivot with respect to the bowl (12) between an idle 

position to which it is returned elastically and in which it closes 
off the filling orifice (24), and a retracted position inside the 

bowl (12) in which the filling orifice (24) is left clear and towards 
which it is driven when a filling nozzle (150) is inserted in the 

filling orifice (24), and having means (76, 96) for automatically 
locking the closure flap (30) in the idle position, including a 

member (110) for controlling unlocking, the closure flap (30) being 
returned elastically in abutment against a seat (28) formed around 

the filling orifice (24), the locking means including at least one 
locking finger (96) mounted so as to be able to move between a 

locking position towards which it is forced elastically and in which 
it extends opposite a portion (98) of the bottom face (36) of the 

flap, and an unlocking position in which it is retracted laterally 
whilst being recessed with respect to the said portion of the bottom 

face of the closure flap, and the member (110) for controlling 
unlocking controlling the movements of the locking finger (96) 

counter to elastic means (100) which act on it, characterised in that 
the locking finger (96) is arranged in the central part (94) of a 

locking arm (76), a first end (78) of which is mounted so as to be 
articulated, with respect to the bowl (12), about a spindle (80) 

perpendicular to the top face of the bowl (12), which surrounds the 
lateral edge of the closure flap (30), and the second end (90) of 

which has a control surface (92) able to cooperate with a control cam 
(120) formed on the control member (150). 
Filling head according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
control member (110) is a control pusher mounted so as to slide in a 

direction perpendicular to the top face of the bowl between a high 
locking position and a low unlocking position, and in that the 

control cam (120) is formed on a lateral edge (117) of the pusher 
(110, 116).  

 
Filling head according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
pusher (110) has means of driving, through the cooperation of shapes, 

arranged between the pusher (110) and the closure flap (30). 
Filling head according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
driving means have a driving rack (126) which cooperates with a 

driving pinion (128, 130) whose rotation is caused by the pivoting of 
the closure flap (30) during its opening travel. 
Filling head according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
pusher (110) is adjacent to the pivot pin (62, 64, 74) of the closure 

flap (30), in that the driving pinion (128) is mounted so as to 
rotate on the pivot pin (62) of the closure flap (30), and in that 

means (74, 136) are provided for coupling the pinion (128) and the 
sealing flap (30) in rotation, which permit a relative angular 

movement between these two elements. 
Filling head according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
pivot pin (62) of the closure flap is rotationally connected to the 

flap (30) and has a radial coupling lug (74) which extends in an 
aperture (136) in the shape of a cylindrical sector which is formed 

in the pinion (128) concentrically with the hole (134) therein 
through which the pivot pin (62, 64) of the closure flap passes, 

whose angle which determines the value of the said angular movement 
is substantially equal to the angle of pivoting of the closure flap 

(30) between its idle position and its retracted position, the 

rotation of the driving pinion (128) by a value equal to the said 
angle causing a movement of the pusher (110) between its low and high 

positions. 
Filling head according to one of Claims 5 or 6, characterised in 
that the bottom face (36) of the flap has a stop element (140) 

arranged in line with the pivot axis (X-X) of the closure flap (30) 
and a lateral face (142) of which cooperates with the said control 

surface (92) of the locking arm (76) carrying the locking finger (96) 
in order to hold the latter in the unlocked position when the closure 

flap (30) is in its retracted position and the pusher is in the high 
position.  

 
Filling head according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the top face of the bowl consists of a cover 

(16) in which the filling orifice (24) is formed and in that the 
closure flap (30) is articulated on the bottom face (18) of the cover 

(16).
