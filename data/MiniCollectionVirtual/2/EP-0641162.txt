<ABSTRACT>
A method is set forth of controlling pests such as termites. The method comprises mixing a residual pesticide with a foaming agent, water and air to produce a temporary non-solidifying pesticidal foam having an expansion ratio, defined as the ratio of the final foam volume to the sum of the volumes of the pesticide, the foaming agent and the water, of between 20 to 1 and 5 to 1. The foam is applied at a locus whereby it contacts a surface which defines the locus, and thereafter deposits the pesticide on the surface and dissipates, so as to provide residual pesticidal action on the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
applying pesticides to irregular and hard to reach 
places such as below concrete slabs and low floors. Many pests are difficult to control with 
pesticides. Termites, for example, must have moisture and 
must transport food to their subterranean colonies in 
order to live. Consequently, they must return to the 
ground around or beside a building after they have 
eaten part of the building. If one can cut off their 
entry or exit, one can substantially control them. A 
pesticide should therefore, preferably be applied at 
the areas of the building where the supporting 
structures touch the ground, or where the termites or 
other pests will enter or exit. When pesticide is 
applied to these areas, the pests, such as termites 
can be controlled; but often they cannot be controlled 
by spraying or by application of pesticidal liquid 
when the areas lie under a concrete slab or similar  
 
obstruction, for example under a wooden floor which is 
only a few inches off of the ground. Cavities often 
develop beneath slabs, where the pests, including 
termites, can collect. They can also go from these 
cavities to the bottom of the slab. If the ground is 
porous, liquid termiticide or repellant must not only 
be applied in large quantities to reach the bottom of 
the slab, resulting in overdosing, but it may be 
actually impossible to fill the cavity. Further, even 
in the absence of cavities, liquid interjected at 
intervals cannot migrate horizontally in porous or 
moderately porous ground in the way necessary to form 
the continuous barrier required to effectively prevent 
pest passage. The above problems have been increased 
due to the fact that present day termite pesticides 
are somewhat less effective than previous termite 
pesticides which, unfortunately, have been discovered 
to have unacceptable environmental impacts. Thus, 
with present day termite pesticides it is even more 
important that they be distributed over all of the 
space beneath concrete slabs and the like. Thus, there are disadvantages with liquid 
pesticide and with pesticide sprays. One method which has been tried to apply 
pesticides is via the generation of what is commonly 
referred to as a dry foam. Japanese patent 
publication SHO 58-43050, for example, shows the use 
of foams which include a termite pesticide, a foaming 
agent, an emulsifier and water. The foam is applied 
utilizing apparatus which is used to chemically 
extinguish fires. Such an apparatus typically forms 
large volumes of

A method of controlling pests in a cavity, comprising the steps of: 

mixing a liquid foamable residual pesticide with a foaming agent, water and 
air to produce a temporary non-solidifying pesticidal wet foam having an expansion 

ratio, defined as the ratio of the final foam volume to the sum of the volumes of the 
pesticide, the foaming agent and the water, of between 20 to 1 and 5 to 1 wherein 

the foam has a flowability of less than about 30 seconds; and 
applying said foam into the cavity whereby the foam contacts the surfaces of 
the cavity, and thereafter deposits the pesticide on the surfaces and dissipates, so as 

to provide residual pesticidal action on the surfaces. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the expansion 
ratio is between 15 to 1 and 6 to 1. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the expansion 
ratio is between 12 to 1 and 7 to 1. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 wherein 
the foam has a flowability of less than about 20 seconds, preferably less than about 

15 seconds. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein  
 

the cavity is the space beneath a concrete slab. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 wherein 
the foam dissipates in from about 5 minutes to about 20 minutes after it is formed. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the 
pesticide is selected from the group consisting of carbamates, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, 

organophosphates, chlorinated hydrocarbons and borates. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7 wherein 
said cavity is beneath a concrete-slab-based building or concrete slabs associated with 

a building, and the method further comprising the step of: 

forming holes through the slab along its marginal edges or other areas within 
the slab to an area beneath the slab, the foam being injected into the cavity through 

the holes. 
A method of controlling pests as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 8 further 
comprising the step of applying a liquid pesticidal composition to the cavity, before 

or after applying the foam.
