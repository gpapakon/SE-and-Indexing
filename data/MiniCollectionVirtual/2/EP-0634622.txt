<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber data link (14) between a 
missile (12) and a moving platform (10) launch site has 

a wound stack canister (16) on the platform and a second 
canister (18) that is aboard the missile. A first 

version of the platform canister (16) locates the wound 
stack (20) within an enclosure (26) with the fiber being 

payed out through an opening (28) in the enclosure which 
has a curved flared edge portion (30). In yet another 

version, the platform canister (32) is mounted within a 
gimbal (38) enabling the fiber payout direction to 

follow a path that does not result in damage to the 
fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
dispensing of optical fiber, and, more particularly, to 
an optical fiber canister which permits payout of the 
fiber in a plurality of different directions. A data link for a missile or other airborne 
vehicle, for example, consists of a length of a filament 
such as wire, or, preferably an optical fiber wound onto 
a canister and which is dispensed upon launch of the 
missile. One end of the filament is connected to 
control apparatus aboard the missile while the other end 
is connected to equipment located at the launch site. On launch, the optical fiber must be dispensed 
in such a manner as not to exceed its inherent tensile 
capabilities and not be kinked or bent to such an extent 
that the transmission of an optical signal will be 
adversely affected. Dispensing of an optical fiber is especially 
difficult where the missile is launched from a moving 
vehicle, such as a helicopter, which may, for a variety 
of reasons, immediately change direction. Maneuvering 
to a new heading changes the fiber dispensing direction  
 
which, if not compensated for in some manner, may 
produce a detrimental effect on the fiber as it is being 
payed out. Moreover, on launching from a moving 
platform, such as a helicopter, it is considered 
necessary in order to prevent pulling with excessive 
force against the fiber, that there not only be a 
dispensing canister on the missile but also a second one 
on the aircraft. It would be highly desirable to provide a data 
link dispensing system for use with a helicopter which 
would enable increasing the allowed range of 
maneuverabilty after launch of the missile without 
resulting in severing the optical fiber data link or 
impairing light signals transmitted over the fiber. In accordance with the present invention, the 
data link includes a length of optical fiber which is 
wound into a helical stack and either fixedly or 
rotatably mounted to the missile, the inner end of the 
fiber being connected in a conventional manner to 
onboard control apparatus. The outer end of the data 
link fiber extends from the missile in a loop and has 
the end wound onto a canister located aboard the launch 
aircraft, e.g., helicopter. By the use of two 
dispensing canisters, one on the missile and the other 
aboard the aircraft, at missile launch tension on the 
fiber is reduced to a minimum thereby avoiding the 
possibility of fiber breakage or distention to the point 
resulting in optical signal deterioration. In one version of the

<CLAIMS>
An optical fiber dispensing apparatus for use on a 
moving platform to establish a data link between the platform 

and a missile (12), comprising: 
   a drum (34) on which a length of the optical fiber 

(14) is wound in a stack (40); 
   a hollow generally cylindrical enclosure within which 

the drum and wound stack (40) are mounted, said enclosure 
(26) having an opening (36) through which the fiber (14) 

passes on payout; and 
   gimbal means (38) mo
unting the enclosure to the moving 
platform for providing the ability to reorient the enclosure 

and drum (34) substantially throughout a solid angle. 
The optical fiber dispensing apparatus as in claim 1, 
in which a substantial loop of fiber (14) is formed outwardly 

of the enclosure (34) prior to missile launch. 
The optical fiber dispensing apparatus as in claim 1, 
in which the enclosure opening (36) through which the fiber 

(14) passes on payout faces in a direction opposite to that 
of the missile launch direction. 
The optical fiber, dispensing apparatus as in anyone 
of claim 1 to 3, in which the moving platform is a helicopter 

(10).
