<ABSTRACT>
A foil-shaped wound covering material based on collagen fibres, its laminates and a process for preparing the same are disclosed. The wound covering material essentially consists of insoluble, partially modified collagen characterized by the following parameters: 0.18 to 0.40 mmol/g amidated nitrogen; less than 5 (my)mol/g glucosamine and less than 5 (my)mol/g galactosamine; shrinking temperature from 45 to 60  C; isoelectric point from 4.3 to 60.0.

Foil-shaped wound covering material based on collagen fibres
characterised in that it consists essentially of insoluble, partially

modified collagen with the following parameters:

amidated nitrogen 0,80 to 0,30 mmol/g
glucosamine and galactosamine content: less than 5 µmol/g
shrinking temperature: from 45 to 60° centigrade
isoelectric point: 4,3 to 6,0
Wound covering material according to claim 1 characterised in that it
contains, based on the weight of the dry film, 1 to 8, preferably 2 to 5%

by weight hyaluronic acid.
Wound covering material according to claim 2 characterised in that the
hyaluronic acid has a molecular weight of more than 500.000.
Wound covering material according to claims 1 to 3 characterised in
that it has a water content of about 12 to 18, preferably 15% by weight.
Method for preparing the wound covering material according to claim
1 characterised in that skived cowhide is macerated in an acidic

medium in a way known per se, comminuted, cooled to a temperature
below 10° centigrade, mixed with physiologically safe humectants and,

in case, physiologically safe organic or inorganic tanning agents,
homogenised and extruded as films in a way known per se and that the

pH of the film is raised to an about physiologic medium. 
Method according to claim 5 characterised in the use of plant or
inorganic tanning agents.
Method according to claim 6 characterised in use of aluminium sulfate-hydrate.
Method according to claims 5 to 7 characterised in that the suspension
is adjusted to a dry matter content of about 2% by weight prior to

extrusion.
Method according to claims 5 to 8 characterised in that the extruded
film is treated with gaseous ammonia to a pH of about 5 prior to drying.
Method according to claims 5 to 9 characterised in that the film is
adjusted to a water content of 12 to 18, preferably 15% by weight after

drying.
Method according to claims 5 to 10 characterised in that the
suspension prior to homogenisation is supplemented with 1 to 8,

preferably 2 to 5% by weight of hyaluronic acid and mixed vigorously.
Wound covering material according to claims 1 to 4 characterised in
that it is laminated in a way known per se with further films or foams of

physiologically safe plastics, spongelike collagen or hydrocolloid based
material or textile tissue or that it is metallized with physiologically safe

metals.
