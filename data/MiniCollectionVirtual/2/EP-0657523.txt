<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production
of, and compositions comprising, a lubricating oil additive
concentrate containing alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylates.In the internal combustion engine, by-products from the
combustion chamber often blow by the piston and admix with the
lubricating oil. Many of these by-products form acidic materials
within the lubricating oil.One class of compounds generally employed to neutralise the
acidic materials and disperse sludge within the lubricating oil are
the metal hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylates, wherein the metal is
an alkaline earth metal such as calcium, magnesium or barium. Both
"normal" and "overbased" alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylates have been employed. The term "overbased" is used to
describe those alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylates in which the ratio of the number of equivalents of the
alkaline earth metal moiety to the number of equivalents of the
salicylate moiety is greater than one, and is usually greater than
1.2 and may be as high as 4.5 or greater. In contrast, the
equivalent ratio of alkaline earth metal moiety to salicylate moiety
in "normal" alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylates
is one. Thus, the "overbased" material usually contains greater than
20% in excess of the alkaline earth metal present in the
corresponding "normal" material.For this reason "overbased" alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted 
salicylates have a greater capability for neutralising
acidic matter than do the corresponding "normal" alkaline earth metal
hydrocarbyl substituted salicylates.Recently, attention has focussed on the production of highly
overbased alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylates.Thus our European application publication No. 0351052 discloses
a process for the production of a lubricating oil additive
concentrate having a TBN greater than 300 which process comprises
reacting at elevated temperature

   component (A) at least one compound which is (i) an alkaline
earth metal hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylate, (ii) a hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylic acid, (iii) an alkaline earth metal
hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylate and a source of sulphur, (iv) a
hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylic acid and a source of sulphur, (v)
an alkaline earth metal sulphurised hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylate, or (vi) a sulphurised hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylic
acid,

   component (B) an alkaline earth metal base added either in a
single addition
