<ABSTRACT>
Bus with a low floor (2) and a superstructure (3) which 
is provided with at least one door opening (5, 6) in 

which a door (7 or 9) is mounted, which door contains at 
least one door panel (8) and a door mechanism (13, 14, 

15) onto which said door panel (8) is suspended and which 
contains means (15) to move the door panel (8) between 

open and closed position, characterized in that the door 
(7 or 9) is a door opening inwards and in that the door 

mechanism (13, 14, 15) contains an upper swivelling arm 
(13) which is fixed, on the one hand, with hinges to the 

superstructure (3) and, on the other hand, eccentrically 
to the door panel (8), and a lower L-shaped swivelling 

arm (14) which is fixed, on the one hand, by means of a 
leg under the floor (2) with hinges to the whole 

consisting of the superstructure (3) and the floor (2) 
and, on the other hand, by means of the other leg, which 

sticks in the floor (2) through a concentrically bent 
groove (37), eccentrically to the door panel (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a bus with a floor and a 
superstructure which is provided with at least one door 
opening in which a door is mounted, which door contains 
at least one door panel and a door mechanism onto which 
said door panel is suspended and which contains means to 
move the door panel between open and closed position,  
 
whereby the door (7 or 9) is an inwardly opening door and 
the door mechanism (13,14,15) contains an upper swivelling 
arm (13) which is fixed, on the one hand hingedly by means 
of a pivot (20, 21) to the superstructure (3) and, on the 
other hand, eccentrically to the door panel (8) and a lower 
swivelling arm (14) which is fixed, on the one hand 
hingedly by means of a pivot (32,33) to the whole 
consisting of the superstructure (3) and the floor and, on 
the other hand, eccentrically to the door panel. 
A bus of this kind is known from NL-C-73069. This bus is 
however a classical bus with a high floor provided with an 
inner stairs at the door. These stairs provide a building-in 
space for the lower swivelling arm which can be built-in 
before and/or under the steps. The passengers are not 
hindered by this lower swivelling arm as they normally wait 
on the elevated floor above the stairwell for the door to 
open.  
 Buses with low floors have been recently developed and 
are specially built to provide access to disabled and 
handicapped persons sitting in a wheelchair. In such 
buses, there are no steps at the door and thus neither 
any gate chambers before and/or under the steps. 
Moreover, the low floor with low step is usually combined 
with an extra "kneeling" of the bus at critical bus 
stops, whereby by means of the pneumatic suspension the 
superstructure with the floor is lowered in relation to 
the street or pavement. New safety problems arise with such buses with low floors 
as far as the doors are concerned, and the conventional 
door mechanisms as used in buses with a normal high floor  
 
as the above mentioned bus described in NL-C-73069, cannot 
be used as such. As there are no such stairs, standing 
passengers can post themselves up against the door. As a 
result, the lower swivelling arm or guiding rods above the 
floor could hurt passengers as the door opens. The invention aims to remedy said disadvantages and to 
provide a bus with a low floor with a relatively simple but 
yet entirely safe door mechanism for the passenger doors. To this aim, not only the floor is a low floor but the 
lower swivelling arm is L-shaped, one of its legs being 
situated

Bus with a floor (2) and a superstructure (3) which is 
provided with at least one door opening (5,6) in which a 

door (7 or 9) is mounted, which door contains at least one 
door panel (8) and a door mechanism (13,14,15) onto which 

said door panel (8) is suspended and which contains means 
(15) to move the door panel (8) between open and closed 

position, whereby the door (7 or 9) is an inwardly opening 
door and the door mechanism (13,14,15) contains an upper 

swivelling arm (13) which is fixed, on the one hand 
hingedly by means of a pivot (20, 21) to the superstructure 

(3) and, on the other hand, eccentrically to the door panel 
(8) and a lower swivelling arm (14) which is fixed, on the 

one hand hingedly by means of a pivot (32,33) to the whole 
consisting of the superstructure (3) and the floor and, on 

the other hand, eccentrically to the door panel (8), 
characterized in that the floor (2) is a low floor and in 

that the lower swivelling arm (14) is L-shaped, one of its 
legs being situated under the low floor (2) and being 

hingedly fixed to the whole consisting of the 
superstructure (3) and the floor (2) by means of the last 

mentioned pivot (32, 33), the other leg protruding through 
a concentrically bent groove (37) in the floor (2) and 

being eccentrically fixed to the door panel (8), both above 
mentioned pivots (20,21 and 32,33) comprising a 

ball-bearing (21 respectively 33) surrounding a hinge pen 
(20 respectively 32). 
Bus according to claim 1, characterized in that at 
least the ball-bearing (21) of the pivot (20,21) fixing the 

upper swivelling arm (13) to the superstructure (3) is a 
self-adjusting ball-bearing.

characterized in that the geometrical pivots of the two 

swivelling arms (13 and 14) are situated in line. 
Bus according to the above claim, 
characterized in that the geometrical pivots of the two 

swivelling arms (13 and 14) are situated perpendicular to 

the floor (2).  
 
Bus according to any of the above 
claims, characterized in that the means (15) to move the 

door panel (8) consist of a remote-controlled source of 
power which acts on the upper swivelling arm (13).

claims, characterized in that the upper swivelling arm 

(13) is shorter than the lower swivelling arm (14).

claims, characterized in that the groove (37) in the 

floor (2) through which the upwardly directed part of the
