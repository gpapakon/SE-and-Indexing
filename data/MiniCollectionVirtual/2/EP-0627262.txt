<ABSTRACT>
The continuously working agitator ball mill for fine and ultrafine milling of material, like the already known ball mill, has a cylindrical or conical milling chamber (1) on a horizontal axis. Arranged in the milling chamber (1) is an agitator (10) which is rotatable about the chamber axis (3) and is intended for moving milling elements (13) present in the milling chamber (1). The known agitator ball mills have the disadvantage that the milling elements are carried along in the direction of the outlet (9) by the flow of material passed through from the inlet (8) to the outlet (9), as a result of which these milling elements accumulate in the area of the material outlet and thereby lose their milling effect and adversely affect the milling process. In contrast, the agitator (10) of ball mill according to the invention now has propeller-like bucket-wheel agitating members (12) or propeller-like agitating members (12) formed with separating and guide discs. The agitating members (12) are designed in such a way that a uniform distribution of the milling elements in the interior space of the milling chamber is retained during the milling process so that disadvantages of the known agitator ball mills are removed.

Continuously operating agitator ball mill serving for the fine and ultrafine milling of a
material and with a cylindrical or conical milling chamber (1, 21) serving for the reception

of milling bodies (13), a material inlet (8) arranged at one end (5, 24) of the milling
chamber (1, 21) and opening into the interior chamber (7) of the milling chamber (1, 21)

and a material outlet (9) arranged at the other end (6, 25) of the milling chamber (1, 21)
and leading out of the interior chamber (7) as well as a stirring mechanism (10, 26), which

is co-axial with the chamber axis (3) and comprises several stirring organs (12, 27, 30, 36,
43, 44), wherein each stirring organ (12, 27, 30, 36, 43, 44) comprises at least two

mutually parallel circular discs (12a, 12b; 27a, 27b; 32, 33, 43b, 43c; 44b, 44c) for moving
the milling bodies (13), characterised thereby, that the stirring organs are constructed in

the manner of bucket wheels or propellers and comprise several conveying elements, that
the two discs (12a, 12b; 27a, 27b; 32, 33, 43b, 43c; 44b, 44c) are arranged at both sides

of the conveying elements, that at least one of the two discs (12b, 27b) has a central
opening (12d, 27d) through which the mixture formed of the milling bodies (13) and the

stock to be milled can flow and that the stirring organs (12, 27, 30, 36, 43, 44) are
constructed and dimensioned in such a manner that, in operation of the agitator ball mill, a

part of the mixture flows continuously over the rim of the disc (12b, 27b, 33, 43b, 44b, 44c)
with the central opening radially inwards to the central opening (12d, 27d, 33a) and from

there back into the gap between the discs (12a, 12b; 27a, 27b; 32, 33, 43b, 43c; 44b, 44c)

longitudinal section and extend towards the disc rims in tangential direction and which
form an integral body with the two discs (12a, 12b; 27a, 27b; 43b, 43c, 44b, 44c).
