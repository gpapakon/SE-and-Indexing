<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dielectric resonator filter 
having, a particular, but not necessarily an exclusive, 
application in a dual mode filter for communications 
satellite payloads. With communications satellite payloads, the main 
problem encountered in realising practical dielectric 
resonator filters is in supporting the dielectric resonator 
in a spatial central position within the cavity of the 
filter. Ideally, the dielectric resonator should hang in free 
space but, in practice, it is necessary to provide a support 
structure for the resonator within the cavity. The support 
structures of known dielectric resonator filters degrade the 
unloaded electrical quality factor of the resonator. This 
is due to additional losses induced in the fabric of the 
support structure. The resonator support structures used in dielectric 
resonator filters for communications satellite payloads must 
be sufficiently rugged and stable to withstand both the high  
 
levels of vibration experienced by space hardware during the 
launch phase of a mission and also the long term effects of 
repeated thermal cycling experienced over the duration of 
the mission. In addition, the perturbation of the resonators 
electrical performance must be minimised and, in particular, 
all additional electrical losses, given rise to by the 
resonator support structure, must be minimised in order to 
achieve the extremely high levels of unloaded Q required by 
narrow band filters. It is an object of the present invention to overcome 
the foregoing problems by providing a dielectric resonator 
filter having a support structure for the dielectric 
resonator which has a high mechanical ruggedness, minimises 
thermally induced stress and has low electrical loss. The thermally induced stress is minimised by closely 
matching the thermal expansion coefficients of all of the 
materials from which the filter and support structure are 
fabricated. The low electrical loss is due to low loss tangents, 
low dielectric filling factors and the positioning of the  
 
support member within the cavity of the resonator so as to avoid areas of high electric 
field concentration. The invention provides a dielectric resonator filter including at least one 
microwave resonator having a cylindrical conductive cavity symmetrically disposed 
about a longitudinal axis and a cylindrical dielectric resonator element supported within 
the cavity characterised in that the cavity (1) has an internally projecting flange (3), in 
that the support for the resonator
