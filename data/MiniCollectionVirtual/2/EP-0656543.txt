<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a withstand
voltage-testing apparatus and more particularly to the
withstand voltage-testing apparatus preferably used to
measure the withstand voltage of a high-voltage component
part such as a high-voltage cable or the like connected
with an ignition plug of an internal combustion engine. In
the apparatus, in order to detect whether electric current
has leaked from the high-voltage component part, a current
transformer and a resistor are used to convert the leakage
current into a voltage, if the leakage current has been
generated therein.The following first and second methods are
adopted to measure the withstand voltage of a work such as
a high voltage cable connected with an ignition plug of an
automobile.In the first method, an automatic deciding
testing apparatus of discharge type shown in Fig. 3 is
used. In the second method, an operator checks whether
electric current has leaked from the work by using a ground
bar, as shown in Fig. 4.In the automatic deciding testing apparatus of
discharge type shown in Fig. 3, a core conductor 2 of a
high-voltage cable 1 used as a work is covered with an 
insulating material 3, and the insulating material 3 is
surrounded with a ground conductor 4. As a deciding
device, a triple-needle discharge device 5 comprising a
positive pole 5a, a negative pole 5b, and a floating pole
5c is used. The positive pole 5a is connected with the
core conductor 2, while the negative pole 5b is connected
with the ground conductor 4. A high-voltage pulse is
applied to the core conductor 2 and the positive pole 5a of
the discharge device 5 by a high-voltage pulse generator 6
comprising a high-voltage generation circuit 6a and an
oscillation circuit 6b.In order to decide whether or not electric
current has leaked from the high-voltage cable 1 by means
of discharge light generated in the gap in the three-pole
needle, the apparatus has an optical leakage current-detecting
means comprising a light receiving section 8 for
receiving the discharge light and a deciding section 9.
The light receiving section 8 comprises an optical fiber 8a
and a high-speed photodiode 8b which generates an inverse
voltage, upon receipt of light introduced to the light
receiving section 8 via the optical fiber 8a. The deciding
section 9 comprises an OSC synchronization comparator 9a
which compares with each other a high-voltage pulse (b)
applied to the core conductor 2 and the positive pole 5a of
the discharge device 5 and the pulse (a) of discharge light
applied thereto by the
