<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a shuttering-free, self-supporting building block system which permits the construction of wall surfaces, ceiling surfaces (floor surfaces) and/or roof surfaces in a simple manner the invention proposes a building block system which comprises a multiplicity of cuboidal building blocks (1) which, in the direction over which the surface to be constructed extends, are braced in layers in each case by at least one tie-rod element (5) which can be introduced into a depression (4) in the building block (1).

A building block system comprising a plurality of building blocks (1) of a parallelepiped
shape, in particular made of a synthetic material, which are adapted to be joinable with each

other to establish a wall surface, a ceiling surface and/or a roof surface, wherein said
building blocks (1), in the direction of extension (E) of the surface to be established, are

respectively braced in layers with at least one tie rod member (5) which is adapted to be
inserted in a recess (4) of said building block (1),
characterized in that

at the junction point of the building blocks (1), at least one traverse (60) is inserted, which
bridges the junction point and has thickened ends (61) to engage in said respectively

adjacent building blocks (1) in a form-closing manner.
The building block system of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each building block (1) is
provided with at least two recesses (4) for the insertion of two tie rod members (5)

associated thereto.
The building block system of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the building blocks (1) of
each layer (6) are staggered with respect to the junction.
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the recess (4) for
receiving the tie rod member (5) has the shape of a sleeve (7) which extends across the

height of the building block (1) and is coupled with the outsides (2, 3) of the building block
(1) by straps (8) and includes a support bar (9) for the tie rod member (5).
The building block system of claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the sleeve (7) has at its one end
a cone (10) and at its other end a correspondingly formed mating cone (11) to receive the

cone (10) of the following building block layer (6) with an accurate fit.
The building block system of claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the support bar (9) is located at
approximately half the height of the sleeve (7) and the building block (1).
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the outsides (2, 3) of
the building block (1) are serrated by a plurality of equidistant grooves (12) extending in the

extension direction (E).
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the outsides (2, 3)
include respective intermeshing stepped ledges (13, 14) at their upper and lower edges

and/or side edges.
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the tie rod member 
(5) has the shape of a screw, into the screwhead (5a) of which the following screw of the

next building block layer (6) can be screwed.
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 for the connection of
an established wall surface (20) to an adjacent roof surface (30) there is provided an angular

junction block (21) having conjunction surfaces on its top (23) and bottom (22) to match with
the building blocks (1).
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 in at least one
building block layer (6) and/or junction block layer (21) there is inserted a ring armature (24)

which extends horizontally to brace in a longitudinal direction (L) of the wall surface.
The building block system of any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the thickened ends
(61) have recesses (62) to let the tie rod members (5) pass.
