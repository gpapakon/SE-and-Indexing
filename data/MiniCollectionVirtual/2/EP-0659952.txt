<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steel spiral staircase with central tube. Short load-bearing elements, which preferably comprise plates (9) and welded-on transverse webs (7, 8), are welded on a central tube (1). The entire assembly is then provided with corrosion protection as one unit, in particular it is hot-galvanised. Stairs (10), which are likewise provided with corrosion protection, are mounted on site.

<CLAIMS>
A tubular newel staircase with a tubular newel made from steel, to which steps are
secured in a radial fashion,

characterised by the fact that short bearing components made out of steel (4, 6, 7, 8, 9), with the
appropriately bored assembly holes (14, 15), are welded to the tubular newel (1). These

components are considerably shorter than the steps (5, 10) which are to be secured to them. The
tubular newel (1), together with its bearing components (4, 6, 7, 8, 9), forms a single unit, and is

protected from corrosion and specially galvanised. The steps (5, 10), with the appropriately bored

assembly holes (14, 15) and the fastening devices, are formed in one piece to be attached and
screwed to the bearing components (4, 6, 7, 8, 9) on site and are similarly protected from

corrosion.
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 1,

characterised by the fact that the steps (5, 10) are made out of steel and are specially galvanised.
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 1,

characterised by the fact that the steps (5, 10) are made out of non-corrosive steel.
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 2 or 3,

characterised by the fact that the steps (10) are constructed as grate steps
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 2 or 3,

characterised by the fact that the steps (5) are constructed as knob, corrugated or bulb plate steps.
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with one of the abovementioned claims,

characterised by the fact that each step (5) has two straps (4, 9) made out of flat bars which
extend outwards from the tubular newel (1) in the approximate area of the outer surfaces of the

steps (5, 10). The reinforced steps (5, 10) which are between these straps (9) or which conceal
them on the outside are secured by being screwed together and protrude radially in a cantilevered

fashion beyond the straps (4, 9). 
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 6,

characterised by the fact that at least one reinforcing plate (6) has been welded between the straps
(4).
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 7,

characterised by the fact that there are two reinforcing plates (7, 8) between the straps (9) placed
at a distance from each other. The inner reinforcing plate (7), which is placed in the area of the

tubular newel (1), serves as the upper bedding surface of the step, and the outer reinforcing plate
(8), which is placed in the area of the outer limit of the straps, serves as the underneath bedding

surface of the step (1).
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 7,

characterised by the fact that both straps (9), placed at a distance from each other, and both
reinforcing plates (7, 8), placed between the straps, have already been welded together to a

prefabricated carrying cell (7, 8, 9) before being welded to the tubular newel (1).
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 9,

characterised by the fact that the prefabricated carrying cells (7, 8, 9) are welded to the tubular
newel (1) both in the area of the straps (9) and in the area of the inner reinforcing plate (7).
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claims 8 or 9,

characterised by the fact that the steps (10) are screwed to the straps (9) by means of at least one
pair of bolts screws.
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with one of the abovementioned claims,

characterised by a similarly specially galvanised, corrosion protected landing step frame (20)
which is equipped on the one hand with a clamp (21) to secure it to the top end of the tubular

newel (1) for support and, on the other, with brackets (22) to secure it to a building or similar
structure. 
Tubular newel staircase in accordance with claim 12,

characterised by the fact that a similarly corrosion protected, specially galvanised, landing step
surface is screwed to the landing step frame (20).
Arrangement of several tubular newel staircases one on top of the other in accordance
with one of the abovementioned claims,

characterised by the fact that the tubular newels (1) are joined together at their ends by means of
clamps (21) and are supported by the side of the building.
Arrangement in accordance with claim 14 together with claim 12 or claim 13,

characterised by the fact that the clamp (21) located on the landing step frame (2) serves to
connect the tubular newels (1).
