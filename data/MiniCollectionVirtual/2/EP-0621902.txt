<ABSTRACT>
DNA structure specific recognition protein of eukaryotic origin and DNA encoding such a factor, as well as probes specific for DNA structure specific recognition protein or DNA encoding it and methods of detecting DNA structure specific recognition protein in eukaryotic cells. In particular, a mammalian cellular factor that selectively recognizes and binds DNA damaged or modified by a drug (the anticancer drug, cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) or cisplatin) has been identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
DNA can be damaged by a variety of environmental
insults, including antitumor drugs, radiation,
carcinogens, mutagens and other genotoxins. Chemical
changes in the component nucleotides or of DNA secondary
and tertiary structure which arise form such external
causes are all considered herein to be DNA modification
or damage. In addition, it is recognized that certain
chemical and/or structural modifications in DNA may occur
naturally, and may play a role in, for example, DNA
replication, expression, or the coordinate regulation of
specific genes. It has been proposed that some types of
DNA modification or damage arising from external sources
are similar to, or even mimic, certain types of natural
DNA chemical and/or structural modification.The mechanism(s) by or conditions under which DNA
modification or damage occurs are presently unknown or
poorly understood. It would be very helpful to have a
better understanding of DNA damage, because DNA damage
can lead to mutations and cancer, as well as cell death;
the latter is exploited in chemo- and radio-therapeutics.
A better understanding of DNA chemical and structural
modifications, including DNA damage, would also be
helpful in that it might serve as the basis for
developing an enhanced ability to repair or otherwise
modify the effects of such damage, leading in turn to
improved organismal or suborganismal resistance to DNA
damaging agents.Publication WO90/03396 discloses a DNA damage-recognition
protein (DRP) present in human cells and 
capable of binding selectively to double-stranded DNA
damaged by the adduction of cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic
agent. Also disclosed is the isolation of two
overlapping clones, 位Pt1 and 位Pt2, encoding polypeptide
fragments that bind selectively to cisplatin-damaged DNA.
Neither the restriction maps (Figure 6) nor the sequences
(Figures 7B and 7C) reported for 位Pt1 and 位Pt2 in
W090/03396 are the same as maps and sequences reported
herein. Indeed, the sequences reported in WO90/03396 do
not encode polypeptide fragments having DRP activity.Toney et al (1989) PNAS 86:8328-8332 relates to the
isolation of cDNAs referred to as lambdaPtl and lambdaPt2
in the present application which encode the said
proteins, and also discloses oligonucleotides each of
which having a nucleotide sequence identical with that of
one of the sequences referred to as "SEQ ID No. 1, 2, 3,
4 and 5" in the present application.The present invention relates to the subject mater
of the claims. The SSRP has been shown to bind
selectively to damaged DNA in
