<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the joining of a metal compound, chosen from tungsten and its alloys, to a material chosen from silicon-containing ceramics, consisting in bringing an intermetallic braze of the Co-Si type into contact with the compound and with the material, and in heating the compound/braze/material assembly to a brazing temperature which is greater than the melting point of the braze and less than the temperature for forming metal-compound/silicon eutectics.

<CLAIMS>
Method of joining a metallic compound chosen from
tungsten and its alloys to a ceramic containing a

silicon-based compound, characterized in that it consists
in bringing into contact with the metallic compound and

with the material an intermetallic braze of the Co-Si
type and in heating the compound/braze/material assembly

to a brazing temperature above the melting temperature of
the braze and below the temperature at which the

metallic-compound/silicon eutectics form.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the ceramic is chosen from SiC and Si
3
N
4
.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the braze has a composition ranging from 39% to

98% by weight of silicon.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the composition of the braze is chosen as 45% to 70%

by weight of silicon.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the intermetallic braze contains 62% by weight of

silicon and 38% by weight of cobalt and in that the
brazing is carried out at 1290Â°C.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that a Co-Si powder is formed, this

powder is suspended in an organic binder and the parts of
the metallic compound and of the material to be joined

together are coated with the suspension obtained.
