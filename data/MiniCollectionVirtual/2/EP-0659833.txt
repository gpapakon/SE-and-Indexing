<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to compositions containing   A) a storage-stable suspension of an epoxy resin and an impact modifier suspended therein which contains no groups which are reactive towards an epoxy resin system,   B) a curing agent mixture comprising     B1) dicyandiamide,   B2) a cycloaliphatic polyamine and   B3) a polyoxyalkyleneamine,  and optionally C) a curing accelerator, conventional fillers, reinforcing materials or additives.   These compositions are particularly suitable as casting resins, lamination resins, prepregs or adhesives.

<CLAIMS>
A suspension of an epoxy resin composition, comprising

A) a storage-stable suspension consisting of an epoxy resin and a toughener
suspended therein, which toughener does not contain any groups that react with an

epoxy resin system,
B) a hardener mixture, consisting of

B1) dicyandiamide,
B2) a cycloaliphatic polyamine, and
B3) a polyoxyalkylene amine,

and, as optional components,
C) a curing accelerator, standard fillers, reinforcing agents or modifiers.
A suspension according to claim 1, wherein the epoxy resin in component A) is a
liquid or solid polyglycidyl ether or polyglycidyl ester, or a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin.
A suspension according to claim 2, wherein the polyglycidyl ether is a liquid or
solid diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol or the polyglycidyl ester is a diglycidyl ester of a

cycloaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid.
A suspension according to claim 1, wherein component A) contains a solid
toughener.
A suspension according to claim 4, wherein the solid toughener is a core/shell
polymer.
A suspension according to claim 1, comprising as component B2) at least one
cycloaliphatic polyamine selected from the group consisting of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane,

bis (4-aminocyclohexyl)methane, bis(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)methane,
4-aminocyclohexyl-4'-aminophenylmethane,


A suspension according to claim 6, comprising at least one cycloaliphatic polyamine
selected from the group consisting of bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane, bis-(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)methane

and

A suspension according to claim 1, wherein component B3) is a polyoxypropylene
amine or a polyoxyethylene amine, or a mixture of both.
A suspension according to claim 8, comprising a polyoxypropylene amine of
formula



wherein n is an integer from 2 to 40.
Use of a suspension as claimed in claim 1 as casting resin, laminating resin,
prepreg or adhesive.
