<ABSTRACT>
Single hand supportable and operable apparatus (30) for providing an output signal characteristic of the morphology of a respiratory tract includes an acoustic pipe (30) for exchanging acoustical energy with the tract. The pipe has an open first end (34) in communication with an opening in the respiratory tract. A transducer (38), such as a loudspeaker, is coupled to the pipe, producing an incident wave towards to opening in the tract and a reflected wave to form a transient wave filed in the pipe representative of the morphology of the tract. Preferably, first (40) and second pressure wave sensing transducers (42), such as microphones, mounted along the length of the pipe in spaced relationship provide first and second transduced signals representative of the transient wave field. A processor (66) processes the first and second transduced signals to provide an output signal characteristic of the morphology of the tract, such as the cross-sectional area as a function of the distance from the opening of the tract.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acoustic imaging of
mammalian airway morphology and more particularly
concerns noninvasively obtaining a signal
representative of the cross-sectional area of an
airway (e.g., oral, nasal, or pulmonary) of a
subject (e.g., a person or an animal) using
electroacoustical transducers.A one-dimensional image of the cross-sectional
area of an airway as a function of axial position
along the airway may be determined from acoustic
reflections measured by a single electro-acoustic
transducer placed in a position remote from the
airway opening. This image is referred to as an
area-distance function and is represented by A(x)
where x is the axial position along the airway.Knowledge of the area-distance function, A(x),
is useful for example in the diagnosis of mammalian
pathologies associated with oral airways, larynx,
pulmonary airways, and nasal airways. These
pathologies include but are not limited to
obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obstructive
pulmonary disease, tracheal stenosis, and nasal
septum deviation.Accurate information about the area-distance
function is also useful in the study of airway 
growth and its disruption and sequelae of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia in children.One approach to using a single electro-acoustic
transducer in acoustic imaging is
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,326,416 granted
April 27, 1982, to Jeffrey J. Fredberg entitled
ACOUSTIC PULSE RESPONSE MEASURING. In all of the
single-transducer approaches described previously,
a hidden constraint pertains. The associated
theories assume implicitly that once propagating to
the left within the apparatus, acoustic returns
encounter no reflection sites within the wave-tube
apparatus itself, which is assumed to be a
reflectionless transmission line; there must be no
secondary rightward travelling waves and no
acoustic reverberation within the wave tube.
However, since the loudspeaker is an unavoidable
and major reflection site for the wave travelling
to the left, the distance separating the
loudspeaker from the receiving transducer must be
greater than the maximum airway penetration depth
of interest; this ensures that secondary
reflections from the speaker arrive at the
receiving transducer only after data acquisition
has been completed. As a result of this distance
constraint, imaging instruments for airway imaging
previously described in the literature are 1 to 2
meters or more in length (Brooks et al.,

Acoustic Reflection, J. Appl. Physiol.: Respirat.
