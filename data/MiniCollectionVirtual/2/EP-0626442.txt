<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to animal oils and
vegetable oils that are transesterified and contain at least one pour point
depressant and antioxidant. In addition to pour point depressants, and
antioxidants, the transesterified natural oil may also contain additional additives
as well as a normally liquid fuel.Successful use of esters of transesterified natural
oils as environmentally friendly, that is biodegradable,
base fluids in industrial applications and also as a fuel
additive when mixed with normally liquid fuels, is
contingent upon improving their low temperature
viscometries. For example, a methyl ester obtained from
the transesterification of rapeseed oil, has utility as an
environmentally friendly diesel fuel. However, this
methyl ester has a pour point of -12°C and solidifies at
13.6°C which results in clogged filters and engine
failure. In order to take advantage of the
biodegradability of transesterified esters of natural
oils, it becomes necessary to lower the pour point.U.S. Patent No. 2,243,198 (Dietrich, May 27, 1941)
relates to non-viscous normally liquid hydrocarbon oils
and more particularly to the production of fuel oils
having improved flow characteristics under low temperature
conditions. The flow characteristics of fuel oil is
improved by the addition of a hydrogenated castor oil
derivative to a non-viscous normally liquid hydrocarbon
oil. Hydrogenated castor oil derivative is defined as the
product obtained by reacting hydrogenated castor oil
either with its own hydroxyl group or with another organic 
compound selected from the classes of alcohols, aldehydes,
acids, isocyanates and isothiocyanates.U.S. Patent No. 4,364,743 (Erner, December 21, 1982)
relates to a fuel source for oil burning devices which is
a fuel in and of itself or can be mixed with petroleum
middle distillates. Fatty acids of the formula

can provide such a fuel wherein
(a) R is (1) an alkyl radical having from 1 to 12
carbon atoms, (2) alkoxy alkyl wherein the alkoxy portion
has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and the alkyl portion is
ethyl or propyl, (3) cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl and (4)
hydroxy ethyl and hydroxy propyl;(b) n = 11-22;(c) a = 2n+1, 2n-1, 2n-3, 2n-5, or 2n-7; and(d) x is 0 or 1.U.S. Patent No. 4,575,382 (Sweeney et al, March 11,
1986) relates to a vegetable oil containing middle
distillate fuel characterized by an improved thermal
stability. The vegetable oils which may be used include
soybean oil, peanut oil and sunflower seed oil.U.S. Patent 4,695,411 (Stern et al, September 22,
1987) relates to
