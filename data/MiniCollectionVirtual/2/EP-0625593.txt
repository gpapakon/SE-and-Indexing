<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a solution for use 
in the electroplating of tin and tin-lead alloys 

comprising a basis solution which includes fluoboric acid 
or an organic sulfonic acid or one of their salts, 

divalent tin ions, and an antioxidant compound which 
includes a transition metal selected from the elements of 

Group IV B, V B or VI B of the Periodic Table in an 
amount effective to assist in maintaining the tin ions in 

the divalent state. Another aspect of the invention 
relates to a method for preventing, reducing or 

minimizing the oxidation of tin ions in an acid 
electroplating solution by adding one of these 

antioxidant compounds thereto. This method is effective 
in certain basis solutions even when iron contamination 

or high oxygen levels are present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electroplating
solutions for reducing the amount
of oxidation of stannous tin ions in an electroplating
solutions containing same.Electroplating baths containing divalent tin are
used widely in industry for plating tin and/or tin alloys
onto basis metals. These baths are acidic and are mainly
based on acids such as sulfuric, phenolsulphonic,
fluoroboric, methane sulfonic, or a combination of
hydrochloric and hydrofluoric. In all of these baths, a
common problem has been the formation of a sludge during
operation that results in a loss of divalent tin and
excessive clean-up costs. This sludge occurs because,
during the plating process, divalent tin has a tendency
to become oxidized to tetravalent tin by oxidation at the
anode or by oxygen which is introduced into the bath from
the surrounding air. Tetravalent tin thus becomes
soluble stannic acid which accumulates in the bath to
eventually form β stannic acid which is not soluble and
which precipitates to form the undesirable sludge. In
order to prevent the formation of this sludge, tin must
remain in the divalent state.When plating tin from these solutions onto strip
steel using insoluble anodes, the problem is multiplied
even further. Oxygen is liberated at these insoluble
anodes to further oxidize divalent tin to its tetravalent
state. U.S. Patent No. 4,181,580 describes a process for
plating strip steel using insoluble anodes and a method
for replenishing tin. Divalent tin is replenished in
these plating installations by separately dissolving
metallic tin granules in a fluidized bed of acidic
plating bath into which oxygen is fed to dissolve the 
metallic tin. The tin enriched solution is returned to
the plating bath thereby replenishing the tin which has
been plated out. Excess oxygen in the tin dissolving
cell described in this patent can also react with
divalent tin to form tetravalent tin; therefore, tin
plating machines of this type are particularly subject to
formation of tin sludge.In normal plating installations using soluble anodes
and cathode rod agitation, the sludge problem can be
minimized. However, when rapid pumping of the solution
is used in high speed plating machines, the inclusion of
substantial amounts of air into the bath accelerates the
oxidation of divalent tin by the oxygen which is present
in the air. The sludge problem therefore exists somewhat
in normal tin plating installations, is worsened in high
speed plating installations, and is further worsened in
strip steel machines that use
