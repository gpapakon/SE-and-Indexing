<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical lifter arm adapted to engage a large refuse or rcycling bin by fork (22) and suction cups (23) and raise and invert the bin for emptying into a truck to which the arm is attached by main frame (3). The lifter arm is actuated by a hydraulic ram (6) operable on a primary arm (4) by way of a primary four bar linkage (11) defined by links between pivot points (9, 14, 16 and 12) to pivot the primary arm (4) about pivot point (9). A secondary arm (5) is pivotally mounted to the primary arm (4) and controlled by a secondary four bar linkage (19) defined by links between pivot points (12, 16, 18 and 20). The geometry of the primary and secondary four bar linkages provides a slow speed commencement and ending to the lifting operation with a relatively high speed movement of the bin therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LIFTER ARM TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a lifter arm and has been devised particularly though not solely for lifting refuse or recycling bins from a ground level position and upÂ¬ ending those bins into a collection vehicle to which the arm is attached.BACKGROUND ART In the past apparatus has been provided in the form of a lifter arm to enable the mechanical lifting and emptying of a refuse or recycling container, typically a large eg: 240 litre wheeled bin from a ground level position into the hopper or chute of a collection vehicle. In the so-called "side lifter" configuration, the arm is provided on the side of a truck, on a sliding base which can be extended from the side of the truck until the end of the arm engages with the container which is then lifted and up-ended into the body of the truck by the lifter arm. The arms are typically comprised of an articulated mechanical linkage operated by appropriate hydraulic piston and cylinder assemblies.Lifter arms of this type previously known have the disadvantage that the initial and final movement of the container, ie : at the point of lifting from the ground, and at the point of discharging into the vehicle, is too rapid which can cause problems and more importantly can cause impact between the container and the vehicle with resultant damage to either or both. It is desirable to provide a lifter arm mechanism which will enable a relatively soft or slow pick-up and similarly a soft or slow delivery into the receiving vehicle. To achieve this aim in an efficient cycle time, the arm movement at the beginning and end of the lifting stroke must be comparatively slow to the lifting speed through the middle of the stroke.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention therefore provides a mechanical lifter arm particularly adapted for lifting 

and up-ending a bin for emptying into a collection vehicle, said lifter arm -comprising a primary arm pivotally mounted to a main frame, a secondary arm pivotally mounted to the end of the primary arm, a primary four bar linkage operable by an hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly on the inner part of the primary arm, and a secondary four bar linkage on the outer part of the primary arm, between the primary arm and the secondary arm, all pivot points for the arms and linkages having parallel axes and typically lying in substantially horizontal planes.Preferably the primary four bar linkage when viewed in elevation has two upper pivot points fixed relative to the main frame, one of those pivot points

CLAIMS :
1. A mechanical lifter arm particularly adapted for lifting and up-ending a bin for emptying into a collection vehicle, said lifter arm comprising a primary arm pivotally mounted to a main frame, a secondary arm pivotally mounted to the end of the primary arm, a primary four bar linkage operable by an hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly on the inner part of the primary arm, and a secondary four bar linkage on the outer part of' the primary arm, between the primary arm and the secondary arm, all pivot points for the arms and linkages having parallel axes and typically lying in substantially horizontal planes.
2. A lifter arm as claimed in claim 1 wherein the primary four bar linkage when viewed in elevation has two upper pivot points fixed relative to the main frame, one of those pivot points comprising the pivot for the primary arm, and wherein the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly is operable between a further pivot point on the main frame and the pivot point of the primary four bar linkage diametrically opposite to the pivot for the primary arm.
3. A lifter arm as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the secondary four bar linkage comprises a common link with the primary four bar linkage, a continuation of the primary arm, a portion of the secondary arm, and a further link between the secondary arm and the pivot point on the common member which is remote from the primary arm. 4. A lifter arm as claimed in claim 3 wherein the said pivot point on the common member remote from the primary arm is also the point of connection of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly to the lifter arm mechanism.
5. A lifter arm as claimed in claim 3 wherein the further link between the secondary arm and the common link is adjustable for length.
6. A lifter arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the secondary arm is provided with 


engagement means for lifting a refuse or recycling bin.
7. A lifter arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the main frame is attached to the collection vehicle by way of a telescopic arm mechanism permitting horizontal movement of the main frame away from and toward the collection vehicle.
8. A lifter arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the primary four bar linkage comprises; a cantilevered arm forming a rigid extension of the main frame and having a length between pivot points of 112 mm, a portion of the primary arm having a length between pivot points of 96 mm, a primary toggle link pivotally mounted to the main frame and having a length between pivot points of 185 mm, and a common toggle link pivotally connected between the primary toggle link and the primary arm and having a length between pivot points of 125 mm, or larger or smaller variations of the primary four bar linkage where all lengths are increased or decreased in proportion. 9. A lifter arm as claimed in claim 8 wherein the secondary four bar linkage comprises; the said common toggle link having a length between pivot points of 125 mm, a further portion of the primary arm having a length between pivot points of 497 mm, a portion of the secondary arm having a length between pivot points of 126 mm, and an adjustable link extending between the secondary arm and the common toggle link and having a length of approximately 480 mm, or larger or smaller variations of the secondary four bar linkage where all lengths are increased or decreased in proportion.
