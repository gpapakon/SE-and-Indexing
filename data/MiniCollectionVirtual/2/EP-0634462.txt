<ABSTRACT>
A coating composition is described which is applied to a substrate and contains very finely divided TiO2, said coating composition comprising from 0.5 to 30.0% by volume of colour pigment and/or carbon black, from 55.0 to 98.5% by volume of binder solids and from 0.3 to 15.0% by volume of very finely divided TiO2 with a particle size of from 5 to 40 nm, and having a high overall reflectance (luminance) and an intense depth of colour. The preparation of the coating composition is also described. Finally, a description is given of the use of the coating composition as an automotive topcoat, industrial coating, printing ink, coil-coating formulation, as a coating for packaging, for plastics and as a decorative paint, and as a varnish (lacquer).

<CLAIMS>
A coating composition which is applied to a
substrate and contains ultra-fine TiO
2
, characterised in
that the coating composition consists of 0.5 to 30.0%

by volume coloured pigment and/or carbon black, with
the proviso that it is not a metallic pigment or metal-like

pigment, 55.0 to 98.5% by volume binder solids and
0.3 to 15% by volume ultra-fine TiO
2
 having a particle
size of 5 to 40 nm.
A coating composition according to Claim 1,
characterised in that at least one coloured pigment,

selected from blue or red coloured pigments, is
contained in the coating composition as the coloured

pigment.
A coating composition according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that at least one binder, selected

from alkyd resin, melamine resin, acrylic resin or
resin is contained as binder solids.
A coating composition according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the ultra-fine TiO
2
 has a specific
surface area of 30 to 150 m
2
/g.
A coating composition according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the total pigment volume

concentration of all the pigment constituents is from
1.0 to 20.0%.
A coating composition according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the pigment volume concentration

for the coloured pigment is 0.5 to 15.0%.
A method for producing a coating composition
according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the

coloured pigment and/or carbon black, binder solids, 
ultra-fine TiO
2
 and solvent are dispersed in known
manner and are applied to a substrate.
The use of a coating composition according to
Claims 1 to 6 as a finishing lacquer for motor

vehicles, industrial coating, printing ink, coil
coating, package coating, plastic coating and

decorative paint, and also as paint.
