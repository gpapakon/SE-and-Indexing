<ABSTRACT>
A process and system for low NOx cogeneration to produce electricity and useful heat. Fuel and oxygen are provided to an internal combustion engine (10) connected to drive an electric generator (9), thereby generate electricity. An exhaust stream is recovered from the engine. Fuel is added to the exhaust stream to create a fuel-rich mixture. The fuel enriched stream is provided to an afterburner (18) to provide a heated oxygen-depleted stream. The oxygen-depleted stream is cooled in a first heat exchanger (22). Conversion oxygen is admixed with the cooled stream which is then passed over a catalyst bed (25) under overall reducing conditions. The stream from the reducing catalyst bed is cooled and air is added to produce a further cooled stream and the further cooled stream is passed over an oxidizing catalyst bed (26) to oxidize remaining combustibles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cogeneration methods 
and apparatus, and more specifically relates to a 
cogeneration process and system which employs an internal 
combustion engine as the primary power source, while 
ensuring extremely low NOx content in the final exhaust 
gases vented to ambient. The invention is an improvement 
upon the process and system disclosed in Applicant's U.S. 
Patent No. 5,022,226. Numerous of the combustion processes incident to power 
generation, generate as well as an undesired product, 
effluent gases having an unacceptable NOx content. More 
specifically, the high temperatures incident to the 
operation of fuel-driven turbines, internal combustion 
engines and the like, results in the fixation of some 
oxides of nitrogen. These compounds are found in the 
effluent gases mainly as nitric oxide (NO) with lesser 
amounts of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and only traces of other 
oxides. Since nitric oxide (NO) continues to oxidize to 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air at ordinary 
temperatures, there is no way to predict with accuracy 
the amounts of each separately in vented gases at a given 
time. Thus, the total amount of nitric oxide (NO) plus 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a sample is determined and 
referred to as "oxides of nitrogen" (NOx). NOx emissions from stack gases, engine exhausts etc., 
through atmospheric reactions, produce "smog" that stings 
eyes and may cause or contribute to acid rain. Other 
deleterious effects both to health and to structures are 
believed to be caused directly or indirectly by these NOx 
emissions. For these reasons, the content of oxides of  
 
nitrogen present in gases vented to the atmosphere has 
been subject to increasingly stringent limits via regulations 
promulgated by various state and federal agencies. In recent years a mode of power production known as 
"cogeneration" has expanded rapidly, due in part to the 
Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA). 
PURPA provided financial incentive to cogenerators that 
sell excess electrical power and indeed mandated that 
utilities purchase power from cogenerators. It also 
allows utilities to own up to 50% of a cogeneration 
facility and receive the benefits of this status. 
Cogeneration may be defined as the simultaneous production 
of both useful thermal energy (usually steam), and 
electrical energy, from one source of fuel. In a typical 
system one or more power sources such as gas turbines, 
may be followed by a waste heat boiler using natural gas 
as fuel for both the
