<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device for slot parking of a mobile vehicle (1), said slot parking (15) consisting in positioning (19, 22), locking (23, 25), unlocking (26, 27) and realigning (28, 29) phases, said method using means to evaluate available parking space relative to immediate surroundings. The invention is characterised in that it consists in: retrieving quantitative input values from sensors, which are transformed or not into gradual qualitative input values; determining on the basis of qualitative rules operating instructions which supply gradual qualitative output data and quantitative output data, which are transformed into quantitative output data to control the vehicle actuators. The invention is useful for parking any type of powered vehicles whereof the wheel can be locked on a common axle, and can be used on public roads, private parking lots or production sites of companies.
