<ABSTRACT>
Textile reinforcement usable for the production of a composite material, consisting, when it is considered in place inside the said composite material after production, of two actual textile reinforcing layers placed on either side of a central layer endowing the said material with thickness, the said central layer consisting of a sheet based on synthetic fibres, of high unit titre, and which have received, before being converted into sheets, a treatment giving them a permanent waviness (or curl). It is characterised in that at least one of the textile reinforcing layers is covered with a fibrous web based on chemical fibres, of lower titre than that of the fibres forming the inner layer and which have also received a treatment giving them a permanent waviness or curl, the various layers being bonded together by needling.

Textile reinforcement which can be used for the 
manufacture of a composite material, consisting, considering 

the situation inside the said composite material 
after manufacture, of two reinforcing textile layers 

proper which are arranged on either side of a central 
layer giving thickness to the said material, the said 

central layer consisting of a web based on man-made 
fibres which have a high individual linear density and, 

prior to them being formed into webs, have received a 
treatment giving them a permanent undulation (or crimp), 


characterized
 in that at least one of the reinforcing 
textile layers is covered with a fibrous lap based on 

chemical fibres having a linear density less than that of 
the fibres forming the internal layer and having also 

received a treatment giving them a permanent undulation 
or crimp, the various layers being bonded together by 

needle punching. 
Reinforcement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that it consists, before manufacture of the composite 

material, of a central layer trapped between two reinforcing 
textiles, at least one of which is covered with 

a fibrous lap. 
Reinforcement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that it consists, before manutacture of the composite 

material, of a layer based on fibres having a high individual 
linear density, this layer being intended to give 

thickness to the final material, covered on just one of 
its faces with a reinforcing textile which is itself 

covered with a fibrous lap, the said material, during the  
 

manufacture of the composite structure, being folded on 
itself so that, in the final structure, there is again a 

central thickness-giving layer on either side of which is 
arranged a reinforcing textile associated with a fibrous 

lap. 
Reinforcement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the layer or layers of reinforcing 

textile consist of fibrous mats possibly associated with 
other reinforcing textiles. 
Reinforcement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
charact
erized in that the layer giving thickness to the 
material and the fibrous lap or laps forming the external 

face or faces are based on polyester, polyamide, 
polypropylene or polyethylene fibres, reinforcing 

elements interposed between these layers being based on 
glass fibres.
