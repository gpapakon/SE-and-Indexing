<ABSTRACT>
A standard pump housing (1) is provided for rotary pumps having impellers with various delivery heads and flow rates. The pump housing can be manufactured by a simple sheet metal shaping technique, is very stiff even at the joint of the pressure pipe and achieves the best possible efficiency. The pump housing (1) has a flattened part (2) at its circumference which narrows the flow room arranged downstream of the impeller and delimited by the pump housing (1), in the direction of the pump axis. An opening for connecting with a pipe (4) having a standard connection cross-section is arranged in the flattened part of the housing.

<CLAIMS>
A pump housing (1) comprising a separately formed output 
connector (4) arranged on its periphery and which is connected 

with an opening (7) provided on the external housing 
periphery, characterized in that on the housing's periphery a 

flat (2) is formed which constricts the flow space, delimited 
by the pump housing (1) toward the pump's axis and on which the 

opening (7) is arranged for the connection of the connector (4) 
with a uniform connection cross section. 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in claim 1, the area of 
the flat (2) being larger than the cross sectional area of the 

opening (7). 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in claim 2, the normal 
to the plane of the flat (2) not passing in the center point of 

the opening (7) through the axis of the impeller. 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in any one or more of 
the claims 2 and 3, the transition radiuses (R1) and (R2) of 

the pump's housing (1) in the flat (2) being different from 
each other. 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in claim 4, the first 
transition radius (R2), which is the first in the direction of 

flow, being larger than the following transition radius (R1). 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in one or more of the 
claims 1 through 5, the opening (7) being provided on the flat 

(2) with an outwardly directed collar (3) to receive the connector 
(4).  

 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in one or more of the 
claims 1 through 6, the flat (2) being parallel to the axis of 

rotation of the impeller 
The pump housing (1) as claimed in one or more of the 
claims 1 through 6, the flat (2) being inclined to the axis of 

rotation of the impeller.
