<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk recording medium and reproduction method
and apparatus thereof, and more particularly to a compact disk (CD) system.The CD is a recording medium in which an optically modulated large capacity
digital data signal (at maximum 800Mb) can be stored in a disk having a diameter of
about 12cm. Such CDs include: an audio exclusive-use CDDA which stores digital audio
data; a compact disk graphics (CDG) or compact disk enhancement graphics (CDEG)
medium for providing lyrics and graphic background picture as well as audio by storing
digital audio data, character data and graphic data therein; a CDV for storing digital
audio data together with video data therein; a CD-ROM which can be used as a data
base, electronic publication, etc., by storing various data and computer program data
therein; and a compact disk interactive (CDI) system for use in multi-media systems by
storing audio, video, character and computer program data therein. The physical
recording formats of such CDs are based on the recording format of the CDDA. The data
recording areas of the CD are largely classified into a lead-in area (LIA), a program area
(PMA) and a lead-out area (LOA). In the CDDA, the digital audio data signal is recorded
in the PMA, and then program running time and contents information (i.e., a "table of
contents") is recorded in the LIA. Thus, the CD reproducer reads the recorded table of
contents from the LIA prior to reproduction, and seeks a selected program to reproduce
the corresponding program. The LIA consists of eight sub-code channels P, Q, R, S, T,
U, V and W. The "table of contents" information utilizes the Q-channel and includes the
program number and running time of a maximum of ninety-nine programs. The CDG
utilizes R through W sub-code channels which are not used in the CDDA and includes
a graphic function for visually displaying lyrics and images corresponding to the songs
of a karaoke apparatus. Since such a CDDA or CDG searches the programs of the PMA
with reference to the table of contents of the LIA, the number of programs which can be
stored in the PMA is limited. For example, since one CD has a maximum capacity of
800Mb, 8,000 still images each having a size of 100Kb can be recorded thereon. 
However, 8,000 sets of the table-of-contents information cannot be completely stored in
the existing LIA region.The CD-ROM and CDI reformulate an audio data block comprising 98 frames,
which is a data processing unit, into that of a sector unit, in order to record or process
the
