<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a muco-adherent, soluble 
device for administering active ingredients, a method of 

using said device, and an improved method of 
manufacturing said device using a continuous, enclosed 

mixing device capable of operating under pressure. The 
devices of the invention, which comprise a lyophilized 

foam and an active ingredient, have a dissolution time 
of at least about 8 hours, and preferably at least about 

24 hours, and can provide for the sustained and/or 
controlled release of an active ingredient for up to 

about 24 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bioerodible device for
administering active ingredients, said device being
intended to be inserted into a body cavity. More
particularly, it relates to a bioerodible device
comprising a water-soluble muco-adherent lyophilized foam
and an active ingredient;
and a method for manufacturing such devices. The delivery
device of the present invention adheres to mucosal tissue
and is accordingly particularly suitable for use in
administering active ingredients to both the buccal cavity
and the vaginal cavity. The delivery device is used to
provide for the controlled and sustained release of an
active ingredient.Prescription and over-the-counter medications and other
pharmaceutical products have traditionally been
administered through oral ingestion, nasal sprays,
injection and suppositories. There are disadvantages
associated with each of these methods of administration.For example, with respect to oral ingestion of a drug,
many patients, including pediatric and geriatric patients,
frequently have great difficulty swallowing a pill. In
addition, there is often a substantial delay between the
time of oral administration of a drug until it has the
desired therapeutic effect in the patient's system.
Generally, a drug must pass from the stomach into the 
small and large intestines before it will be absorbed
into the patient's bloodstream. This typically takes
about forty-five minutes or longer. Moreover, many drugs
that are taken orally are metabolized almost immediately
and thereby rendered ineffective by the patient's system
before they can have the desired therapeutic effect.Likewise, many patients also have at least some aversion
to injections or suppositories. Moreover, neither of
these methods are readily conducive to self-administration.Consequently, many patients simply fail to comply with
their physicians orders with respect to taking medications
that are administered in these ways.Compressed tablets or extruded thin films, including
multi-layered products, that are inserted into the buccal
cavity for delivering an active ingredient are known in
the art. See, for example, US 4,540,566,
Davis et al. which discloses a compressed tablet
comprising cellulose ether; US 4,389,393,
Schor et al., which describes a buccal delivery system
consisting of a compressed tablet comprised of
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or a mixture of
methylcellulose and sodium carboxylmethylcellulose, and/or
other cellulose ethers; U.S. US 33,093, issued
to Schiraldi et al.; U.S. US 4,900,552, which
discloses
