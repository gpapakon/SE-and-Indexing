<ABSTRACT>
This is an invention of a dental brush characterized by 
comprising a dispersed thermochromic material in its head and/or 

bristles, in such a manner that a change in coloration of these 
elements occurs in a time which the user associates to the minimum 

adequate time for a good brushing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in respect to a tooth brush 
with a means of indication of the adequate time for 
brushing. The correct habits for brushing teeth and for the 
correct time are very important parameters in good buccal 
hygiene, with the aim of avoiding caries and plaque 
formation, etc. While the correct brushing technique depends greatly on 
the learner, brushing time depends principally on the 
attention and motivation of the user, and it is this 
parameter which the invention searches to administer. There is data demonstrating that brushing teeth for 
short periods of time is inefficient (SANTOS, V.I.M. dos et 
alii., Rev. Odont. USP - 4(4);318-322, out/dez 1990, e WADE, 
A.B. "The prevention of periodontal diseases" Kimpton, 
London, 1971, pag. 218-23) showing that an indicative means 
of minimum brushing time is of great value to advise, to 
teach or even to encourage the user to behave correctly and 
cautiously in benefit of good oral hygiene. The state-of-the art technique reveals some attempts to 
obtain this effect. The documents of the patents 
JP56100384, US4150106 and FR2591102, for example, discuss 
dentifrice which change colors after a certain interval of 
time once brushing has taken place. These documents have no 
relation with the present invention. Other indicative means of brushing time are discussed 
in the state-of-the-art technique, e.g., in the following 
patent documents: 
DE2918802 - chronometer associated to brushing, set 
off by the buccal temperature or set off manually to begin  
 
timing. GB2230942 - dental brush whose handle has a dial with 
an animated figure set off electrically, indicating the 
passage of time. WO8900302 - an hourglass with children's figures or 
motifs to mark the brushing time. DE3433254 - tooth brush with electric chronometer 
which emits sound signals after a correct interval of 
brushing time. DE1117180 - tooth brush with electrical device that 
signals acoustically a correct brushing time, associated to 
the application of correct pressure. US5044037 - tooth brush with a sound generator 
associated to the handle, which plays music according to the 
correct brushing time. DE3149233 - tooth brush with a device (electrical or 
spring chronometer, tape recorder or lamp) which remains 
active for the correct brushing time. EP210094 - a support for a tooth brush which registers 
the time of the brush's absence, associated to the brushing 
time. Although efficient for the purpose proposed, such 
revelations in the state-of-the-art fail because
