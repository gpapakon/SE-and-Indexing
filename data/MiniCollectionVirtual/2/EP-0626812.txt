<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid preservative composition which is suited for the preservation of green forage or the like and which contains as its active ingredient benzoic acid or its derivative. Benzoic acid or its derivative specifically promotes useful microbial activity in green forage. In the present invention their action is enhanced by adding to the composition propionic acid, which dissolves them, or a mixture of the same, together with formic acid and/or acetic acid. These acids also as such promote the said useful microbial activity. Other constituents which improve solubility and conventional agents promoting lactic acid fermentation can also be added to the composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composition suitable for an 
additive of a plant material, containing aliphatic C2-C3 
carboxylic acid and benzoic acid or hydroxybenzoic acid, the 
said acids optionally at least partly in the form of salts or 
esters. Benzoic acid and certain of its derivatives are previously 
known as preservatives in, for example, foods and animal 
forage. The poor solubility of benzoic acid in water and in 
aqueous acid mixtures is also known. The use of carboxylic acids for the preservation of products 
associated with agriculture is also well known. According to 
the AIV process, green forage will keep when its pH is lowered 
to below 4 by means of acids. At present, formic acid is increasingly 
used for the lowering of pH. The preservative according to FI Patent 61790 (Huitson, BP 
Chemicals) contains formic acid which has been partly neutralized 
with ammonia. The preservative composition may additionally 
contain, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, or 
butyric acid. The preservative composition according to GB patent 1,481,961 
(Huitson & Watts, BP Chemicals) contains C5-C8 monocarboxylic 
acid in addition to propionic acid, n-butyric acid and/or iso-butyric 
acid. The use of octanoic acid, for its part, is known 
according to FI application 903761 (Huitson, BP Chemicals) in 
preservative compositions based on formic acid. The compositions 
described in the application contain water 10-50%, and 
besides formic acid they also contain propionic acid. The 
acids are preferably partly neutralized with ammonia. On the basis of US patent 3,600,198 compositions of propionic 
acid/Na-propionate and benzoic acid/Na-benzoate having the 
volume ratios of 70:30 and 95:5, which are intended for  
 
preserving fish. The drawback of these compositions is the 
high price and they are, therefore, suitable only in special 
occasions. As a preservative of green forage they, for 
example, are not capable of competing. FI patent 63328 (Lampila) discloses a preservative composition 
which contains a constituent which increases the hydrogen ion 
concentration in forage and a benzoic acid constituent which 
acts synergistically with it and may be benzoic acid or its 
salt or derivative. The preservative composition according to this patent is said 
to be in the form of either a solid or a solution. It is 
evident from the patent text that benzoic acid is insoluble in 
acid, and therefore it is dispersed to form as homogeneous a 
suspension as possible by using thickening and gelling agents 
known per
