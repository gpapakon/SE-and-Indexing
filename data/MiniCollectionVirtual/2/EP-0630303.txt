<ABSTRACT>
In a method of ejecting an elongate blank (57) from a die (58) in the form of a through-going channel in which one end of the blank (57) has been formed by a tool, comprises the use of an ejector rod or needle (60, 62) which is moved into the die (58) against the other end of the blank. The blank (57) is released in the ejection first in that an ejector rod or pin (60), short with respect to the length of the die (58), moves the blank (57) a relatively short distance, and that the blank (57) is then ejected using another ejector rod or pin (62) having substantially the same length as the die (58). An apparatus for ejecting an elongate blank (57) from a die (58) comprises a first relatively short ejector rod or pin (60) adapted to release and move the blank (57) a relatively short distance, and a second ejector rod or pin (62) adapted to eject the blank from the die (58) and having substantially the same length as the die (58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for 
ejecting an elongate blank from a die in the form of a 
through-going channel, where one end of the blank has been 
formed by a tool. Use is made of an ejector rod or pin 
which is moved into the die against the other end of the 
blank. In the production of elongate objects, such as e.g. 
screws, it is a known method to retain a blank in a die, 
while one end of the blank is formed by one or more tools. 
The die frequently has the shape of a through-going 
channel, and during forming the opposite end of the die is 
frequently closed by a bottom stop or in that the ejector 
pin forms the bottom of the die. When the blank has been 
finished, it is to be ejected from the die, and this is 
done by means of an ejector rod or pin which is moved into 
the die from the bottom stop end. To ensure that the blank 
is ejected completely, an ejector pin of substantially the 
same length as the blank or the die is required. However, 
a great force is required to release the blank from the 
die, and this entails the risk that the long pin breaks or 
bends. This often occurs in existing machines. So far, it has been attempted to remedy this problem by 
carrying out some form of lubrication to reduce the force 
required to eject the blank from the die. Thug, the blank 
may e.g. be phosphatized. However, this is a both costly 
and time-consuming solution, which also has environmental 
drawbacks. Moreover, such lubrication also involves a risk 
of the blank being unintentionally drawn out of the die 
when a tool is withdrawn after having formed the head of 
the blank. Such a blank may get jammed and cause great  
 
damage to the vital parts of the machine. It is also known to prevent deflection or break of the 
long ejector pin by supporting the pin by a complicated 
telescopic support; but this is a solution which unduly 
adds to the manufacturing costs. From DE-C-867 944 corresponding to the preambles of claims 1 and 2 
a device and a method is known in which the blank is 
released in that a first ejector rod or pin, short with 
respect to the length of the die, ejects the blank a short 
distance, whereafter the blank is then ejected completely from 
the die using another ejector rod or pin in the form of the next blank. This known apparatus and method ensures that the blank 
can be ejected from the die without any risk of ejector 
pin deflection or breakage. First, the blank is 
loosened and pushed slightly out of the die by a short 
ejector pin. Since this pin is

A method of ejecting an elongate blank (57) from a die 
(58) with a through-going channel of constant diameter, one end of the blank 

(57) having been formed by a tool, said method comprising 
the use of ejector rods or pins (60, 62) sequentially moved 

into the die channel against the other end of the blank, and 
wherein the blank (57) is released 

in that a first ejector rod or pin (60), short with respect to 
the length of the die channel ejects the blank (57) a relatively 

short distance, whereafter the blank (57) is fully ejected

the same length as the die (58), 
characterized
 
in that the first ejector rod or pin (60) moves the blank 

a well-defined distance toward a control unit (63) adapted 
to produce a signal in response to the geometry of the 

blank.
