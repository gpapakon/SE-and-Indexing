<ABSTRACT>
There is a need in analyzers for test 
elements to be removed from a processing station, 

washed and returned to that station. Described herein 
is shuttle apparatus (100) and method for catching a 

test element (E) ejected from an incubator (40), for 
carrying it to a station outside the incubator (40), 

for example, a wash station (70), and for returning it 
to a loading station (20). Preferably, the apparatus 

comprises a simplified catcher plate (110) and means 
(160) for moving the plate (110) in an arcuate path 

(112) around a portion of the circumference of the 
incubator (40). The plate (110) cooperates with stop 

means (180) disposed above the arcuate path (112), to 
capture a washed element upon reloading, so that the 

washed element can be reloaded by returning it to the 
original path used to load elements into the incubator 

(40) in the first instance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to analyzers for 
ascertaining analyte concentrations in body liquids 
which are dispensed on to test elements, and is 
particularly concerned with analyzers which need a wash 
station to allow immunoassays to be conducted. Analyzer mechanisms have been provided for 
receiving slide test elements from incubators, to carry 
them on to additional stations, for example, a wash 
station. Such a mechanism is described in 
US-A-4 857 471. Although this mechanism functions 
admirably, it uses a platform which lowers into the 
"dump" path of the ejected slide element to catch the 
slide element The platform cannot move on to the wash 
station but provides a stationary support. As a 
result, a claw must then be used to transfer the slide 
element from this stationary support to a movable 
train. Thus, the noted mechanism has the disadvantage 
of requiring a transfer claw and means other than the 
catching surface to move the slide element to the wash 
station. Furthermore, the train which is used for the 
wash step transfer is of substantial size and 
complexity. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a transfer mechanism in an 
analyzer which is off-line from the incubator and which 
allows a slide element to be removed from the 
incubator, washed and re-inserted, and uses simpler and 
less expensive parts than the prior art mechanisms. A shuttle mechanism has been constructed and 
method for operation thereof has been devised which 
solve the aforesaid problems. The mechanism includes a 
catcher plate which provides the required movement of a 
"caught" test element ejected from an incubator to a 
wash station and back into a loading station for re-insertion  
 
into the incubator. Furthermore, the catcher 
plate is constructed to provide other important 
features, all in one simplified piece. More specifically, in accordance with one 
aspect of the present invention, there is provided an 
analyzer comprising a plurality of processing stations 
including an incubator, inject path defining means for 
injecting a test element bearing a sample liquid along 
a first path into one of the processing stations, 
ejecting means for ejecting a test element from the one 
station, and discharge path defining means for defining 
a second path for carrying an ejected test element away 
from the one station, characterized in that a stop mechanism is 
provided between the first path and the second path,

a) a shoulder adjacent the first path to

<CLAIMS>
An analyzer (10) comprising a plurality 
of processing stations (20, 30, 40, 50, 52, 70, 80) 

including an incubator (40), inject path defining means 
for injecting a test element (E) bearing a sample 

liquid along a first path (29, 32) into one of the 
processing stations (40), ejecting means for ejecting a 

test element (E) from the one station (40), and 
discharge path defining means for defining a second 

path (82) for carrying an ejected test element (E) away 
from the one station (40), 

   characterized in that a stop mechanism (180, 
182, 184, 186, 190, 192) is provided between the first 

path (29, 32) and the second path (82), the mechanism 
including 


a) a shoulder adjacent the first path to 
prevent a test element (E) on the first path (29, 32) 

from moving off it towards the second path (82), and 
b) a camming surface (190, 192) under and 
adjacent to the stop shoulder, the camming surface 

(190, 192) being shaped to cause the stop mechanism 
(180, 182, 184, 186, 190, 192) to ride up over a test 

element (E) moved from the vicinity of the second path 
(82) to the first path (29, 32) so that a test element 

(E) can be moved only from the second path (82) to the 
first path (29, 32) and not from the first path (29, 

32) to the second path (82). 
An analyzer according to claim 1, 
wherein the track-defining means (160, 162, 164) are 

arcuately shaped to define an arcuate track. 
A test element support for use in an 
analyzer which analyzes analytes of a body liquid 

contained in a test element (E), the support comprising 
a plate (110, 120, 122, 124, 128, 130) having a frame 

(120), a central portion (128) within and flexibly 
 

secured to the frame (120), and raised shoulders (122, 
124) on opposite edges of the frame (120) dimensioned 

to retain a test element (E) therebetween to prevent a 
held element (E) from being displaced off the support, 

the central portion (128) being cantilevered from the 
frame (120) at only one side thereof so as to be 

capable of flexing in and out of the plane of the frame 
(120). 
A test element support according to 
claim 3, wherein one of the shoulders (122) is provided 

with an upwardly projecting cam surface sloped 
sufficiently to allow the frame (120) to ride under a 

test element (E) which is on the support if the test 
element (E) is held from movement with the support.
