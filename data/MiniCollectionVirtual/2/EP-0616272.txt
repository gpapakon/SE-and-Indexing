<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a circuit for suppressing bouncing effects, and comprises:   - sampling means (3) for sampling a control signal (C) at a first sampling frequency (CLKA) and for providing an output signal (Ci) occupying either a high-level state or a low-level state, - detection means (4) for determining the switching of the said output signal (Ci) from one of the said states to the other of the said states, and - sampling disabling means (5) for preventing the said sampling means (3) from sampling the said control signal (C) for a predetermined period of time during which the contact is intended to remain in a position corresponding to one of the two states in response to the change in the state of the said output signal (Ci), so that the said output signal (Ci) remains in the said other state during at least the said period.

Circuit for suppressing the effect of rebounds 
and parasitic commutations of a contactor (2) on a control 

signal (C) produced by said contactor (2), said control 
signal (C) being in either a first state corresponding to 

an open position of said contactor (2) or a second state 
corresponding to a closed position of said contactor (2), 

said contactor (2) intended to change from one of said 
positions to the other of said positions and to remain in 

said other position for a predetermined time, 
characterized in that said circuit comprises : 


sampling means (3) for sampling said control 
signal (C) at a first sampling rate (CLKA) and 
for
 
providing a output signal (C
i
) being in either said first 
state or said second state, 
detecting means (4) for determining 
the
 change of 
said output signal (C
i
) from one of said states to the 
other of said states, and 
sampling prevention means (5) for preventing said 
sampling means (3) from sampling said control signal (C) 

for said predetermined time in response to the change in 
state of said output signal (C
i
), in order that said 
output signal (C
i
) remains in said other state for at 
least said predetermined time. 
Circuit according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said detecting means (4) determines the change of 

state of said output signal (C
i
) by detecting when two or 
more consecutive samples of said control signal (C) are in 

said other state. 
Circuit according to either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said contactor (2) is controlled by 

a rotary cam (8). 
Circuit according to claim 3, characterized in 
that it is used in an analog electronic watch having a 

shaft, said cam (8) being rotatably driven by said shaft 
when the watch is in normal operation.  

 
Circuit according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said shaft is an hours-hand shaft. 
Circuit according to either of claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that said watch comprises a rotatable 

time-setting crown (14) and in that said cam (8) is 
rotatably driven by said crown (14) while said watch is 

time-set. 
Circuit according to claim 6, characterized in 
that said sampling prevention means (5) is adapted to be 

inoperable when said watch is in a time-setting position, 
and in that, during this time-setting, said sampling means 

(3) is adapted to sample said control signal at a second 
selected sampling rate (CLKB).
