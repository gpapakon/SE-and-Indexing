<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a tread (1) having a 
central portion (Cr) and shoulder portions (Sh), 

said shoulder portions (Sh) formed on both sides of 
said central portion (Cr), two main grooves (3) 

provided symmetrically of the equatorial plane of 
the tyre, said main grooves (3) dividing said 

shoulder portions (Sh) from said central portion 
(Cr) and extending in the circumferential direction 

of said pneumatic tyre, characterised by a plurality 
of centrally lateral grooves (6) provided in said 

central portion (Cr), said central lateral grooves 
(6) extending in the direction of tyre's width, all 

walls (6a, 6b) of said central lateral grooves being 
inclined in the same direction with respect to a 

line (SL) in the radial direction of the tyre; and a 
plurality of shoulder lateral grooves (7) provided 

in each of said shoulder portions (Sh), said 
shoulder lateral grooves (7) extending in the 

direction of the tyre's width, and being inclined in 
opposite directions to said central lateral grooves  

 
(6) with respect to the axial direction of the tyre, 

all walls (7a,7b) of said shoulder lateral grooves 
(7) being inclined in opposite directions to the 

walls (6a,6b) of the central lateral grooves (6) 
with respect to a line (SL) in the radial direction 

of the pneumatic tyre.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre in 
which the effect of residual cornering force due to 
the tread pattern is sufficiently suppressed to 
provide improved maneuverability. To assure effective water drainage, the surfaces of 
ordinary roads have cants or are inclined in such a 
way that they are highest in the central area while 
decreasing in height towards either shoulder of the 
road. Hence, a vehicle running straight on a 
straight road is subjected to a force exerted by the 
road to have the vehicle go down the cant, whereby 
it has a tendency to swerve in that direction. As a matter of fact, depending on various tyre 
factors such as construction and shape, the tyre 
itself can be an effective source of lateral force, 
which is commonly referred to as "residual cornering 
force". If the residual cornering force balances 
with the lateral force developed by the cant, the 
vehicle will not swerve.  
 The residual cornering force is generally held to be 
highly susceptible to the direction of the belt 
placed under the tread, particularly to the 
direction of the belt cords that lie radially 
outwards of the tyre. Accordingly, the direction in 
which the belt cords are attached is in turn 
determined by the cant of the road. Consider, for example, the case where vehicles are 
required to run on the left side of the road; since 
the road surface on the left side is provided with a 
cant sloping downward to the left, some swerving of 
vehicles can be prevented if the cord in the 
outermost layer of the belt is attached in a 
direction sloping upward to the right as seen from 
the outside of the tyre (see Fig. 9). In the other 
case where vehicles are required to run on the right 
side of the road, the road surface on the right side 
is provided with a cant sloping downward to the 
right; therefore, some swerving of vehicles can be 
prevented if the cord in the outermost layer of the 
belt is attached in a direction sloping upward to 
the left as seen from the outside of the tyre (see 
Fig. 10).  
 In fact, however, the residual cornering force is 
occasionally developed by the tread pattern and it 
has been difficult to develop an appropriate amount 
of residual cornering force by simply adjusting the 
direction of the belt cords. A brief description of the developing mechanism of 
the residual cornering force is given here. Since 
the crown portion of the tyre tread has a greater 
radius of rotation than the shoulder portion, a 
tractive force works on the blocks provided in the 
crown
