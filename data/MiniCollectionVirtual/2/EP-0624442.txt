<ABSTRACT>
The L-shaped try square (6) is provided for a tile-cutting apparatus with a support plate (1) and is retained, by means of its one leg (7), on the support plate (1) such that it can be displaced and fixed transversely with respect to the cutting direction. On the leg (8), running in the cutting direction, of the try square (6), a segment (29) can be displaced longitudinally and pivoted around a vertical axis and fixed. On a straight bounding edge (33), of said segment (29), which is directed towards the support plate (1), a stop (26) in the form of a strip is retained such that it can be displaced longitudinally and is pivotable, together with the segment (29), around the vertical axis. The segment (29) exhibits, on the bounding edge (33) or a bounding portion (39) parallel thereto, a stop (36) having a side surface (38) which is at right angles with respect to the bounding portion (39). Said side surface (38) and the bounding portion (39) form a corner which contains the axis of the segment (29). Said axis coincides, in all the positions (longitudinal and angular positions) of the segment (29) with respect to the leg (8), with the inner longitudinal edge (25) of said leg (8) and with the abutment edge (41) of the stop (26) in the form of a strip, or is located in the point of intersection thereof.
