<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to use of a compound represented by the formula 
(I): 


wherein ring W is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring residue which may 
be substituted; R¹ is hydrogen or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon 

residue which optionally binds through a hetero-atom; R³ represents a group 

capable of forming an anion or a group capable of changing thereto; X shows 
that the phenylene and phenyl groups bind to each other directly or through a 

spacer having an atomic length of two or less; n denotes 1 or 2; a and b 
forming the heterocyclic ring residue are independently one or two optionally 

substituted carbon or hetero atoms; c is an optionally substituted carbon or 
hetero atom; provided that, when the ring W is a condensed ring, R¹ is 

hydrogen or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon residue which binds 
through a hetero atom, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the 

manufacture of a medicament to be used as a vascular hypertropy suppressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vascular hypertrophy suppressor
comprising a compound (or salt thereof) exhibiting angiotensin II
antagonistic action and having excellent vascular hypertrophy inhibitory
actions as an active ingredient.Easy and safe angiography has become feasible as a result of technical
advances, development and improvement of radiographs and development of
safe contrast media. Angiographic methods are roughly divided into two
types: arterial angiography and venous angiography, including (1) methods
in which the artery or vein is directly perforated percutaneously (carotid
arteriography, vertebral arteriography, femoral arteriography, brachial
arteriography, pelvic venography, lower limb venography), (2) methods in
which the artery or vein is surgically exposed, incised and catheterized for
imaging (cardiovascular angiography, inferior vena cava venography,
pulmonary arteriography), (3) methods in which a catheter is inserted
percutaneously by the Seldinger technique (peritoneal arteriography,
abdominal aortic arteriography, renal arteriography, inferior vena cava
venography, hepatic venography) and (4) methods in which a contrast
medium is injected to the vein or artery and the arterial or venous phase is
photographed. The development of the Seldinger technique made possible
percutaneous intravascular catheterization (intravascular catheterization
requires a surgical procedure in prior art methods), leading to remarkable
advances in angiography.Objectives of angiography include 1) qualitative and quantitative
evaluation of lesions in blood vessels, 2) qualitative and quantitative
evaluation of lesions in various organs and surrounding tissues on the basis of
vascular exclusion and/or invasion pictures, 3) dynamic and functional
evaluation of blood vessels by continuous imaging of contrast medium flow,
and 4) anticancer agent injection to lesions via blood vessels. Advances in
imaging techniques have markedly improved bypass (shunt) surgical
treatment. Bypass surgery, a type of blood route reconstructive surgery for 
obstructed blood vessels, constructs a bypass from the proximal to distal sides
of the obstructed portion (bypass transplantation), including aortocoronary
bypass, aortoiliac bypass and cardiopulmonary bypass.However, vascular perforation in angiography and vascular cutting,
suturing etc. in bypass surgery can cause vascular hypertrophy, since they
affect the blood vessel by direct physical stimulation.Compounds exhibiting angiotensin II antagonistic action, used in the
present
