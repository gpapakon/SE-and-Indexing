<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
retroreflective appliqués and articles to which such 
appliqués have been applied. In order to improve safety of pedestrians, 
joggers, workers on roadways, etc., retroreflective 
markings have been attached to clothing. In one common 
embodiment, retroreflective appliques comprising a 
monolayer of retroreflective elements (e.g., 
transparent microspheres with hemispheric reflectors) 
partially embedded in a layer of binder material, with 
adhesive backings are bonded to articles of clothing. 
In other embodiments, the appliqués are sewn onto a 
substrate. A problem with such appliqués is that their 
retroreflective performance tends to diminish 
unacceptably when the garment to which they are applied 
is washed. After just a few washings, the 
retroreflective brightness of the appliqué may be 
reduced to a small fraction, e.g., 5 percent or less, 
of its original brightness. This decrease is due to 
loss of retroreflective elements from the surface of 
the appliqué and/or degradation of the retroreflective 
elements, e.g., corrosion of aluminum hemispheric 
reflectors, during washing. As a result the visibility 
of the appliqué is reduced, thereby impairing the 
safety of the wearer. The problem is particularly troublesome when 
the clothing is subjected to industrial laundering, 
where the conditions of laundering are often more 
severe than conventional home laundering. For 
instance, in an industrial laundry, the laundering 
conditions may include wash temperatures of 40° to 90°C 
(105° to 190°F) and pH of 10 to 12.5, whereas in  
 
contrast, typical conditions for home laundering may 
include temperatures of 4° to 60°C (40° to 140°F) and 
pH of less than 11. Also, home laundering equipment 
typically subjects the articles being cleaned to less 
rigorous handling and stress than does industrial 
laundry equipment. In some embodiments, organosilane and/or 
zircoaluminate coupling agents have been used to 
improve the adhesion of the binder material to the 
retroreflective elements. Illustrative examples of 
previously known coupling agents include 
vinyltriethoxysilane, 
gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 
gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, 
gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 
gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 
gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-beta-(aminoethyl)-gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 
triaminofunctional 
trimethoxysilane, amino functional zircoaluminate, 
carboxy functional zircoaluminate, and mercapto 
functional zircoaluminate;
