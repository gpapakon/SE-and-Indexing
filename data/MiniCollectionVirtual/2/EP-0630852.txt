<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle jack with a standing column (10), a supporting arm (16) linked to the standing column (10) and pivotable relative to the standing column (10) by means of a threaded spindle (26), and a load carrier (20) which is attached to the front supporting-arm end and has at the top a load-bearing area (52a, 52b) for attaching to a body area coated with an underseal compound, the load-bearing area (52a, 52b) having a multiplicity of projections (56), configured for pressing into the underseal compound, in order to prevent the load carrier from slipping on the body.

Vehicle jack with a standing column (10), on the lower end
of which is provided a sole plate (38) for placing the standing

column on the ground, with a supporting arm (16) which in the
region of a first, rear end is articulated on the standing

column (10) above the sole plate thereof so as to be pivotable
about a first transverse axis (18), and also with a threaded

spindle (26) which is articulated by means of a first support
(32) in the region of the upper end of the standing column (10)

so as to be pivotable about a second transverse axis (34) which
is parallel to the first transverse axis (18) and for pivoting

of the supporting arm (16) is pivotably connected to the latter
by way of a second support (20), wherein one of the two supports

(32, 20) forms a nut (32) for the threaded spindle (26) and the
second support (20) is pivotable relative to the supporting arm

(16) about a third transverse axis (22) which is also parallel
to the first transverse axis (18), and with a load-bearing part

(20) which is mounted on the supporting arm (16) in the region
of a front end thereof and has at the top at least one profiled

load-bearing region (52a, 52b) for applying to an undersealed
region of the bodywork (42) of a vehicle to be lifted,

characterised in that the load-bearing region (52a, 52b) has a
plurality of projections (56) which are constructed to press

into the underseal material and which - viewed in the
longitudinal direction of the threaded spindle (26) - take the

form of tooth-shaped ribs which - in a top view of the vehicle
jack - extend transversely with respect to the pivot axes (18,

22, 34).
Vehicle jack as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that
the projections (56, 58) of the tooth profile have an

approximately triangular cross-section. 
Vehicle jack as claimed in one or more of the preceding

claims, characterised in that - viewed in the direction of the
threaded spindle (26) - the load-bearing region (52a, 52b) has

on each of its ends a support segment (58), the profile of which
corresponds to a tooth directed obliquely outwards and upwards

with an upper flank (58a), which extends parallel to the said
region of the bodywork and forms a supporting surface, and a

lateral flank (58b) extending transversely thereto.
Vehicle jack as claimed in one of more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the load-bearing part (20) has a

groove (46) which extends from its load-bearing region (52a,
52b) into the load-bearing part and runs approximately parallel

to the third transverse axis (22) and which divides the load-bearing
region approximately in the middle.
Vehicle jack as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that
the groove (46) widens towards the base of the groove.
Vehicle jack as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the load-bearing part (20) is pivotable

about the third transverse axis (22) relative to the supporting
arm (16).
Vehicle jack as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that
the load-bearing part (20) is not pivotable relative to the

threaded spindle (26).
Vehicle jack as claimed in one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the sole plate (38) is articulated

on the lower end of the standing column so as to be pivotable
about a fourth transverse axis (40) which is parallel to the

first transverse axis (18). 
Vehicle jack as claimed in one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the load-bearing part (20) is made

at least substantially from a plastics material.
