<ABSTRACT>
A sanitary napkin (1) has a basic body (1A) comprising 
a liquid-permeable topsheet (2), a liquid-resistant 

backsheet (3), and a liquid-absorbent core (4) sandwiched 
between the sheets (2,3). There are provided adjacent 

transversely opposite side edges of the basic body (1A) a 
pair of elastically stretchable flaps (5) in the form of 

straps and rising from the backsheet (3), adhesives being 
applied on the top surface of said flaps (5) so that said 

flaps (5) may be adhesively fastened to the user's skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sanitary napkin for use 
by women during menstrual periods for absorbing and 
retaining menstrual fluids. It is well known in sanitary napkins to apply a 
skin-contacting surface thereof with suitable adhesives so 
that the skin-contacting surface may be adhesively fastened 
to the user's skin and thereby otherwise possible leakage 
of menstrual fluids due to the displacement of the napkin 
during its use may be avoided. For example, Japanese 
Utility Model Application Disclosure No. 1993-7222 
discloses a sanitary napkin provided along transversely 
opposite sides thereof with fastening means comprising 
band-like hydrophobic cushion members made of a foamed 
urethane or the like and adhesives applied on top surfaces 
thereof. As an alternative measure to avoid said leakage 
of menstrual fluids, it is also known 
from e.g. EP-A-0 508 477 
to provide 
transversely opposite sides of a napkin with flaps so that 
these flaps may cooperate with a topsheet to form a pocket 
and any quantity of menstrual fluids tending to flow 
transversely of the napkin may be reliably received by the  
 
pocket. The adhesion of the adhesives employed must be 
necessarily enhanced in order to assure that said prior art 
fastening means might compensate for the movement of the 
user's body without separation of said fastening means from 
the user's skin. However, the enhanced adhesion would 
increase the user's discomfort inevitably accompanying the 
separation of the napkin from the user's skin. The prior art 
napkin including the side flaps having rubber threads 
bonded thereto in their stretched state along respective 
free edges of the flaps is certainly advantageous in that 
the pocket is sufficiently opened as the napkin is 
longitudinally curved inward to receive menstrual fluids 
effectively. However, the pocket can be sufficiently 
opened only when the napkin is not in close contact with 
the user's skin i.e., the napkin is at a position 
appropriately spaced from the user's skin. Consequently, 
the conventional sanitary napkin of such type can not 
effectively avoid the leakage possibly occurring when the 
napkin gets out of its proper position longitudinally 
and/or transversely.  
 In view of the problems as described above, it is 
a principal object of the invention to provide a sanitary 
napkin so improved that there are provided, adjacent 
transversely opposite side edges of the napkin, flaps 
comprising elastically stretchable straps applied on their 
top surfaces with adhesives and
