<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention is directed to oligonucleotide compounds wherein on or more phosphodiester linkages between adjacent nucleotides are replaced by a formacetal/ketal type linkage. The nucleotides of the present invention are resistant to nucleases and do not need to exhibit the diastereomerism characteristic of many other oligonucleotide compounds and thus are capable of strong hybridization to target RNA or DNA. These oligonucleotide compounds are useful in therapies which modulate gene expression using antisense or other specifically binding oligomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the construction of 
modified oligonucleotides and their components which are 
resistant to nucleases, have enhanced ability to 
penetrate cells, and are capable of binding target 
oligonucleotide sequences invitro and invivo. The 
modified oligonucleotides of the invention are 
particularly useful in therapies utilizing antisense DNAs 
to interrupt protein synthesis or otherwise inactivate 
oligonucleotides. More specifically, the invention 
concerns oligomers which contain at least one replacement 
of the phosphodiester linkage with a formacetal/ketal 
type linkage bearing sufficiently stabilizing electron 
withdrawing groups. A rational basis for the development of 
antisense therapies for diseases whose etiology is 
characterized by, or associated with, specific DNA or RNA 
sequences has been recognized for a number of years. The 
basic principle is straightforward enough. The ultimate 
therapeutic agent, whether directly administered or 
generated insitu, is an oligomer which will be complementary 
to a DNA or RNA needed for the progress of the 
disease. By specifically binding to this target DNA or 
RNA, the ordinary function of these materials is 
interdicted. The logic behind this approach is readily seen 
in visualizing the administration of, for example, an  
 
oligomer having a base sequence complementary to that of 
an mRNA which encodes a protein necessary for the 
progress of the disease. By hybridizing specifically to 
this RNA, the synthesis of the protein will be 
interrupted. However, it is also possible to bind even 
double-stranded DNA using an appropriate oligomer capable 
of effecting the formation of a specific triple helix by 
inserting the administered oligomer into the major groove 
of the double-helical DNA. The elucidation of the 
sequences which form the targets for the therapeutics is, 
of course, a problem which is specific to each target 
condition or disease. While the general principles are 
well understood and established, there remains a good 
deal of preliminary sequence information required for the 
design of a particular oligomeric probe. One feature of the oligomeric probes which is, 
however, common to most targets is the structuring of the 
backbone of the administered oligomer so that it is 
resistant to endogenous nucleases and is stable invivo, 
but also retains its ability to hybridize to the target 
DNA or RNA. (Agarwal, K.L., et al., Nucleic Acids Res

USA (1988) 85:7079.) As
