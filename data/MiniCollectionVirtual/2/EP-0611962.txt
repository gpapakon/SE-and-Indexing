<ABSTRACT>
A system for analysing the particulate containing in the 
exhaust gases of a Diesel engine comprises a dilution 

tunnel (3) in which a portion of the exhaust gas flow is 
fed, together with a flow of dilution atmospheric air. The 

diluted gas coming from tunnel (3) is passed through a 
filter (13) for collecting the particulate contained in 

the gas and subsequent weighing thereof. There are 
provided precision pressure and temperature meters for the 

dilution air and diluted gas flow, as well as volumetric 
flow meters of the dilution air and the diluted gas flow. 

A computer provides for processing the output signals from 
said meters and gives a measurement of the volumetric flow 

of the dilution air, the diluted gas and, by difference, 
of the exhaust gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the methods and apparatus
for measuring the quantity of particulate contained in
exhaust gasses of Diesel internal combustion engines. Said
apparatus are necessary in order to carry out tests
provided by the laws for homologation of Diesel engines
for motor-vehicles.The rules in force in the United States provide that the
engine is run through a working cycle simulating actual
traffic conditions. According to the test provided by
these rules, the entire exhaust gas flow is diluted with
ambient air in a dilution tunnel. The entire diluted gas
flow is kept constant, by adjusting the dilution ratio
when exhaust gas flow increases or decreases. After
mixing, a sample of the diluted flow is extracted and
passed through a filter which collects the particulate.
The quantity of extracted particulate is than determined
by weighing.The main drawback of the above indicated method lies in
that it implies the use of apparatus of huge dimension and
very high cost. For this reason, said system with total
dilution of the exhaust gas flow, called also CVS
(Constant Volume Sampling) is not fully satisfactory from
the point of view of convenience and economy of use.Until 1991, the test adopted in the EEC did not provide
for the measuring of the quantity of particulate, but only
an opacimeter measurement of the quantity of light
transmitted through the undiluted exhaust gas flow.Starting from 1992, the EEC rule has introduced a 
gravimetric measurement of the particulate, accepting the
use of a partial dilution system of the exhaust gasses.
According to such system, most part of the exhaust gas
flow is not used for the test, whereas a portion thereof
is extracted to be diluted with ambient air for the
following gravimetric determination of the quantity of
particulate contained therein.There have been proposed already methods and apparatus for
extracting the particulate from the exhaust gasses
according to the partial dilution system. The advantage of
the methods of this type is that they use apparatus which
are much less bulky and less costly with respect to those
necessary for the CVS tests. However, the apparatus used
up to now for conducting tests of the partial dilution
type are not fully satisfactory, basically for their
insufficient precision compared with the results which may
be obtained with the CVS systems.An apparatus having the features indicated in the
pre-characterizing portion of Claim 1 is known from
WO-A-9204611. However this known apparatus basically
operates under a

Apparatus for extracting particulate from the exhaust
gasses of an internal combustion Diesel engine,

wherein :

the apparatus comprises an exhaust gas dilution tunnel
provided with a probe for feeding a portion of the exhaust

gas flow coming from the engine into a dilution tunnel,
said probe (2) is communicated to an inlet portion (4)
of the dilution tunnel (3) in which a conduit (5) for

feeding dilution atmospheric air opens,
in said conduit (5) for feeding dilution air there are
interposed a pressure meter (9), a temperature meter (10)

and a volumetric flow meter (11),
the outlet of the dilution tunnel (3) is communicated to
a filter (13) for collecting particulate contained in the

diluted gas, the outlet of the filter (13) being connected
to a conduit (14) in which there are interposed at least a

pressure meter (19), a temperature meter (20) and a
volumetric flow meter (22), characterized in that said apparatus comprises:


a pump (6) arranged in said conduit (5) for feeding dilution air,
a computer which receives output
signals from said volumetric flow meters and is arranged

to determine the volumetric flow of diluted gas and
dilution air and, by difference, of the exhaust gasses, as

well as to compute, instant by instant, the volume of
flowed gas, and to compare the latter with a predetermined

value of volume, so as to check when the volume of flowed
gas is equal to said predetermined value, and in that

in parallel to filter (13) there is arranged a by-pass
conduit (24) in which there is interposed a regulation

valve (26), and in that valve means are provided to
address selectively the diluted gas to said filter (13) or

to said by-pass conduit (24), as well as control means for 
regulating a pump (21) for sucking the diluted gas so as

to keep the gas flow constant during all the stages of the
test.
