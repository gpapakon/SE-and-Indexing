<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit (40) has a low-power mode in which 
at least one switched inverter stage (60) of a clock amplifier 

(41) is disabled in response to a stop signal. The stop signal 
indicates that the integrated circuit (40) is in low-power mode. 

In one embodiment, each switched inverter stage is a 
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) switched 

inverter (60), in which an additional P-channel transistor (61) is 
connected between the source of an inverter P-channel transistor 

(62) and a positive power supply voltage terminal, and in which an 
additional N-channel transistor (64) is connected between a 

source of an inverter N-channel transistor (63) and a negative 
power supply voltage terminal. A non-switched inverter stage 

(52) remains active during low-power mode to maintain a DC 
value of a clock input signal near a switchpoint of the clock 

amplifier (41).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electronic circuits, and 
more particularly, to integrated circuits with a low-power mode 
and clock amplifier circuits for such integrated circuits. Many integrated circuits require an external clock signal to 
control sequential logic, switched-capacitor filters, or the like. 
The clock signal must be amplified and buffered on-chip in order 
to drive a large number of clocked circuits. In some very-large-scale 
integration (VLSI) devices it is necessary to minimize high-frequency 
interference caused by harmonics contained in a square 
wave input clock signal. For these devices, the input clock signal 
is preferably a sinusoidal signal of relatively small amplitude, 
such as one volt peak-to-peak, which is alternating current-(AC-) 
coupled through a capacitor to a clock amplifier. The clock 
amplifier typically includes an inverter which is self-biased to 
keep the direct current (DC) voltage on the input node near the 
switchpoint of the inverter. An important feature for integrated circuits is to be able to 
operate in a low-power or "sleep" mode. In the low-power mode, 
most circuitry is disabled to save power and this circuitry does 
not need to be clocked. Upon re-entering normal operation, this 
circuitry again needs a clock signal for proper operation. It is 
desirable for the integrated circuit to disable as much circuitry 
as possible during low-power mode and to recover quickly from 
low-power mode. These performance requirements create a 
tradeoff for the clock amplifier. If the clock amplifier is 
disabled during low-power mode, then the coupling capacitor may 
discharge and the output of the clock amplifier will not switch 
while the coupling capacitor is recharging. However, the 
amplifier is always biased near its switchpoint during operation,  
 
resulting in a significant DC current. Thus, if the clock amplifier 
remains enabled during low-power mode, power consumption 
increases. A clock amplifier circuit which avoids these tradeoffs 
is needed. Accordingly, there is provided, in one form, an integrated 
circuit with a low-power mode, comprising an inverter portion, a 
resistor, a logic portion, and an internal circuit. The inverter 
portion receives a clock signal and a stop signal, and provides an 
output signal on an output terminal thereof in response to the 
clock signal. The inverter portion includes a switched inverter 
and a constant inverter. The switched inverter receives the clock 
signal and the stop signal, and provides a first
