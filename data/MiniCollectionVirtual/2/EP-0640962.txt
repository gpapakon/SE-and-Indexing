<ABSTRACT>
An optical device structure can be simplified and 
miniaturized on the whole. A fabrication of optical device can 

be simplified and the optical device can be improved in 
reliability. The optical device can increase its output, operate 

a light emitting light source with a reduced power and reduce a 
power consumption by increasing a quantity of reflected-back 

light to a photosensor device, i.e., a quantity of photosensed 
light. An optical device includes a light emitting section (1), 

a radiated section (2), a converging means (3) and a photosensor 
section (4). Light emitted from the light emitting section (1) 

is converged and radiated on the radiated section (2) by the 
converging means (3). Reflected-back light (L
R
) reflected from 
the radiated section (2) is converged and the photosensor 

section (4) is disposed near a confocal of the converging means 
(3) concerning reflected-back light from the radiated section 

(2). Light emitted from the light emitting section (1) is 
passed through a path of the same axis and photosensed by the 

photosensor section (4) as shown by a one-dot chain line (
a
) 
representing the optical axis before and after the emitted light 

is reflected by the radiated section (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical device
having a photosensor section to detect reflected-back light
generated when light from a light source is radiated on and
reflected by a radiated section of optical recording media, such
as optical disc, magneto-optical disc or the like.In optical devices, such as optical disc drive of a
so-called compact disc (CD) and an optical pickup section of a
magneto-optical disc drive, optical parts, such as a grating and
a beam splitter, are separately assembled and therefore an
overall arrangement thereof becomes complicated. Moreover,
since the optical placement setting of these optical parts is
cumbersome, optical devices cannot be mass-produced efficiently.FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings schematically
shows a structure of an example of optical device in an enlarged
scale. As shown in FIG. 1, light emitted from a light source
51, such as a semiconductor laser diode or the like, is
introduced through a grating 52 to a beam splitter 53, from
which separate light beams are converged on an optical disc
recording portion of a optical recording medium 56 through a
collimator lens 54 by an objective lens 55. A one-dot chain
line c in FIG. 1 depicts an optical axis extended from the light
source 51 to the optical recording medium 56.Reflected-back light from the optical recording medium
56 is traveled through the objective lens 55 and the collimator
lens 54 and reflected by the beam splitter 53, separated from 
the optical axis c, traveled through a concave lens 57 and a
cylindrical lens 58 disposed on the right-hand side of the beam
splitter 53 and converged and detected by a photosensor section,
i.e., a photodetector 59, such as a photodiode (PD) or the like.FIG. 2 shows a structure of another example of optical
devices, i.e., an optical pickup section of a reflection type
optical scanning microscope. As shown in FIG. 2, light emitted
from the light source 51 is reflected by the beam splitter 53
and radiated and converged through the objective lens 55 on the
surface of a sample 60. In FIG. 2, reference numeral 61 depicts
a focal plane. Then, light reflected on the sample 60 is
traveled through the objective lens 55 to the beam splitter 53.
Light traveled through a photodetector or a pin-hole 62 disposed
at a confocal position is detected by the photodetector 59
disposed behind the pin-hole 62. At that time, it is possible
to detect the state of the surface of the sample 60 by either
translating a stage (holder) of the sample 60 or by relatively
scanning
