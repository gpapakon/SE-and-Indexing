<ABSTRACT>
A method for repairing a tubular conduit (1) by lining 
the inner wall of the tubular conduit with a tubular 

liner bag (2) impregnated with thermosetting liquid 
resin, comprising the steps of; (a) everting the tubular 

liner bag in the tubular conduit; (b) closing the open 

end of the tubular liner bag with a stationary lid (3b) 
thereby forming a closed space (S) inside the tubular 

liner bag and the lid; (c) inserting a heat-resistive 
hose (7) into the closed space through the lid; (d) 

inflating the tubular liner bag by charging a pressurized 
fluid into the closed space; and (e) supplying hot water 

via the heat-resistive hose to thereby heat and harden 
the liner bag; wherein the heat-resistive hose is 

slidably inserted through the lid, and is connected to 
the lid via a flexible inflatable sealing device such 

that when the pressurized fluid is charged into the 
closed space the sealing device is pressed to inflate 

externally from the lid thereby forcing the 
heat-resistive hose to slide externally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for repairing a tubular
conduit by lining the inner wall of the tubular conduit with a
tubular liner bag.When an underground tubular conduit, such as a pipeline or
passageway, becomes defective or too old to perform reliably, the
tubular conduit is repaired and restored without digging the
earth to expose the tubular conduit and disassembling the sections
of the tubular conduit. This non-digging method of repairing an
underground conduit has been known and practiced commonly in the
field of civil engineering. Typically, the method is disclosed by
Japanese Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai) Sho 60-242038.According to this publication, this method of conduit repair
comprises inserting a sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag
into the tubular conduit to be repaired by means of a pressurized
fluid, such as air or water. The tubular liner bag is made of a
flexible resin-absorbent material impregnated with a thermosetting
liquid resin, and has its outer surface covered with an impermeable
plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed end
of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open end of
the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked (anchored) at
the end of the defective or old tubular conduit in a manner such
that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly covers 
and closes the conduit end; a portion of the liner is pushed into
the conduit; then, pressurized fluid is applied to the said
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the conduit. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the conduit, it remains there while the rest
of the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds
deeper in the conduit, and this manner of insertion is what
is meant by the term "everting" as used
throughout this application. When the entire length of
the tubular liner bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the
conduit, the control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner
bag to thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the
conduit. Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the
inner wall of the conduit by the said pressurized fluid, and the
tubular flexible liner is hardened as the thermosetting liquid
resin impregnated in the liner is heated, which is effected by
heating the fluid filling

A method for repairing a tubular conduit (1) by
lining the inner wall of the tubular conduit with a

tubular liner bag (2) impregnated with thermosetting
liquid resin, comprising the steps of: (a) everting the
