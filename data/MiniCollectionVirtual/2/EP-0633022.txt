<ABSTRACT>
A chondroprotective agent comprising a flavonoid 
compound of the general formula (I): 


wherein R¹ to R⁹ are, independently, a hydrogen atom, 
hydroxyl group, or methoxyl group and X is a single bond or a 

double bond, or a stereoisomer thereof, or a naturally 
occurring glycoside thereof is disclosed. The above compound 

strongly inhibits proteoglycan depletion from the chondrocyte 
matrix and exhibits a function to protect cartilage, and 

thus, is extremely effective for the treatment of 
arthropathy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of an agent for 
protecting cartilage, i.e., a chondroprotective agent, 
more particularly, a chondroprotective agent containing a 
flavonoid compound according to formula I or a 
stereoisomer thereof, or a naturally occurring glycoside 
thereof. There are various types of arthropathy, for example, 
rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, and 
osteoarthritis. Many people particularly suffer from 
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. These diseases 
have been studied as the major types of arthropathy. 
There are congenital and secondary osteoarthritis, and 
further primary osteoarthritis caused by degeneration of 
the articular cartilage along with aging. Patients 
suffering from primary osteoarthritis have recently been 
increasing along with the increase in the population of 
the aged. Although there are considerable differences of the causes 
and conditions between rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis, the articular function becomes eventually 
obstructed by the destruction of the cartilage in both of 
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The first choice of medicines for the treatment of 
rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
rheumatic fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
osteoarthritis are analgesic and anti-inflammatory 
agents, for example, aspirin or indometacin. Further,  
 
gold compounds such as Shiosol, immunomodulators, 
steroids, or D-penicillamine are used as medicines for 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The above conventional analgesic and anti-inflammatory 
agents, however, were not effective against the 
destruction of the articular cartilage, and in fact, 
sometimes exhibited adverse effect in experiments using 
chondrocytes. Further, no inhibitory effect on articular 
cartilage destruction was also observed in the above-mentioned 
medicines for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis. It is known that flavonoids may be used as an agent for 
protecting a blood vessel and further in the following 
pharmaceutical applications: a virus genome deactivating 
agent for apigenin, chrysin, morin, fisetin, and 
baicalein [Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 2-101013], an agent for determining the function of 
polymorphonuclear leukocyte for flavonoids [Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63-253254], an 
oral agent for suppressing smoking for flavonoids 
[Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 
4-46119], treatment of high protein edema for rutin, 
diosmin, and the like (U.S. Patent No.
