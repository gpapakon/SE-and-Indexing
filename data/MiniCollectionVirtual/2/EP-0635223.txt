<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser of products such a creams and the like 
for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use, comprising: a 

lid (11) which closes on to a first annular 

abutment (2) of an outer body (1) having an open 
bottom end (7) wherethrough a recipient (17) 

containing the product is inserted and removed; 
said recipient (17) having an open bottom end (20) 

housing a piston (24) which when manually pressed 
in an axial direction, without a rotation, presses 

the product in the recipient (17) towards a 
dispensing aperture (19) afforded in a closed end 

(18) of the recipient (17) such as to dispense a 
continuous quantity and not a prefixed dose of 

product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dispenser for viscous 
fluid products such as creams, gels and the like, 
used generally as cosmetics or pharmaceuticals. The container comprises a vase or external body 
into which a refill recipient is inserted. The refill has an open inferior end into which a 
closing body is inserted, which body also 
functions as a piston which when manually pressed 
in an axial direction only (without rotation) 
pushes the product towards an aperture situated at 
a top end of the refill recipient. The user, 
obviously, is ready with his or her other hand to 
collect the thus dispensed fluid. Such types of 
container are well known on the market, such as US 
4,984,718 and 5,000,600, both by the same 
applicant. The above dispensers comprise: a lid, an outer 
tubular cover having a circular internal section 
with an open top and a closed bottom end; a 
tubular inner body, coaxial to the external cover,  
 
with an open bottom end and a closed top end 
affording an aperture for dispensing, with a 
rotatable upper portion slidably in contact with 
the internal surface of the outer body; an axially 
holed and threaded piston which is commanded to 
rise by a threaded axial rod solid to the external 
body when the outer body is made to rotate with 
respect to the inner body. The above-described containers are provided with 
rotary-translating movement and are somewhat 
complex to realize. Furthermore, they are not 
simple to use, as one hand is needed to hold the 
outer body while the other twists the projecting 
portion of the inner body. Following rotation a prefixed dose of the product 
exits from the aperture and deposits on the closed 
top surface of the container, which can only then 
be collected by the user, as he or she now has a 
hand free. Other containers on the market have a balance 
device on the top surface, such that by pressing 
on the surface the balance tips and creates 
internally to the container (thanks to the 
presence of a pump) a decompression which draws a 
dose of the cream and causes it to exit.  The principal aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above-mentioned inconveniences by 
providing a dispenser of viscous fluid product 
having a dispensing action formed by manually 
in particular for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use. 
The invention is also free of complex mechanisms 
and thus can be press-formed and assembled very 
simply, leading to a considerable reduction in 
production costs. The invention, as it is characterized in the 
claims that follow,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dispenser of viscous fluid product having a 
dispensing action constituted by a manual pressure 

on a bottom surface thereof, in particular for 
cosmetic and pharmaceutical use, characterised in 

that it comprises: 
a tubular outer body (1) having an open top end 

(7) and a partially closed bottom end (8) 
centrally affording a wide aperture (9), which 

outer body (1) externally exhibits a first annular 
shoulder (2) dividing the outer body into a top 

portion and a bottom portion, the top portion 
being thinner in breadth than the bottom portion; 

a tubular hollow recipient (17, 17a) removably 
housed in the outer body (1) exhibiting an 

external wall (21) and a tubular internal wall 
(23) and being superiorly closed by a top wall 

(18) affording a dispensing aperture (19) for 
dispensing the fluid viscous product, and being 

open at a bottom end (20); 
a tubular piston (24), housed internally of the 

bottom end (20) of the tubular recipient (17, 
 

17a), and provided with a lateral seal; being 
mobile in a direction along the inner tubular wall 

(23) when a manual pressure is applied thereupon 
in proximity of the aperture (9) in the outer body 

(1) at a central portion of the piston (24) and 
coaxial to the aperture (9); 

a lid (11); 
first means and second means (5, 14, 22, 16, 38) 

for removably engaging the recipient (17, 17a), 
the outer body (1) and the lid (11). 
A dispenser of fluids as in claim 1, characterised 
in that the first means for engaging are a thread
