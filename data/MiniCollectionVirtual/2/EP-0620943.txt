<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a locking apparatus (1) for a string of a stringed instrument, which locking apparatus includes a locking cam (20, 23-27) arranged rotatably about a point of rotation and a locking wall, which locking cam and locking wall are positioned relative to each other in such a way that a string can be locked between them, wherein the rotatable arranged cam is an eccentric made from a hard and stiff material, placed in a U-shaped channel of a hard and stiff beam (3), said channel containing the locking wall, a small spring being added, holding the locking cam to the locking wall in case no string is present between the locking wall and the locking cam and the eccentric being shaped in such a way that the locking cam and the locking wall contact at only one point, in case there is no string in between.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Locking apparatus for a stringThe invention relates to a locking apparatus for a string of a stringed instrument, which also includes a tuning mechanism for the string, which locking apparatus includes a locking cam arranged rotatably about a point of rotation and a locking wall, which lock¬ ing cam and locking wall are positioned relative to each other in such a way, that a string can be locked between them.Such a locking apparatus for a string of for instance a violin or a guitar is known from US patent 1,732,172. This known apparatus composes a joint construction with means to tune the individual strings of the stringed instrument. Therefore, the string is guided through an opening in a channel of a tuning means. In order to anchor the string to the stringed instrument the string is subsequently pulled out of the other side of the tuning means. Subsequently, the string is anchored to the locking means. The locking apparatus includes a rotatably arranged locking cam and a locking wall, between which the end of a string can be guided. Both the locking cam and the locking wall in the known apparatus, pre- ferably, include a roughened surface. The locking cam and the lock¬ ing wall are shaped in such a way, that, when the string is being pulled in the direction of the other end of the string, the locking cam and the locking wall seize and lock the string. Thereby the tensioned string is in direct physical contact with the locking cam over such an extent of the locking cam that the tension of the string provides for a leverage to the rotatably arranged locking cam and increases the locking force of the locking apparatus. In order to use the tuning means, the locking apparatus has to be guided into the channel of the tuning means, while the string remains tensioned. After the string is anchored on its other end, the locking apparatus can be moved through the channel of the tun¬ ing means by means of a butterfly nut, in order to regulate the tension in the spring.In the known locking apparatus the locking cam is not pro- vided with a spring, so that the locking cam, whenever no tensioned spring is inserted, will dangle without taking any defined posi¬ tion. Moreover, when a loose string is guided between the locking cam and the locking wall, the string will not yet be locked. The 

 string will only remain locked tight in the locking apparatus when the string is tensioned. By insertion of the string into the lock¬ ing apparatus in the channel of the tuning means, therefore, the string has to maintain a

Claims
1. Locking apparatus for a string of a stringed instrument, which also includes a tuning means for a string, which locking apparatus includes a locking cam arranged about a point of rotation and a locking wall, which locking cam and locking wall are posi¬ tioned relative to each other in such a way, that a string can be locked between them, characterized in that the rotatably arranged locking cam (20, 23-27) is an eccentric from a hard and stiff material, placed in a U-shaped channel being freely accessible from one side and provided in a hard and stiff beam (3), which channel includes the locking wall (411), a small spring (30, 63, 65) being provided holding the locking cam to the locking wall in case no string is present between the locking wall and the locking cam, and the eccentric is shaped in such a way that the locking cam and the locking wall contact at only one point in case there is no string in the channel.
2. Locking apparatus according to claim 1 , characterized in that the beam (3) includes further U-shaped channels, one for each string of the stringed instrument, and furthermore each channel in¬ cludes its own locking cam and locking wall, so- that for each string a locking apparatus is present.
3. Locking apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the beam (3) is placed directly behind the top nut (50) of a guitar.
4. Locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the locking wall of the U-shaped channel (channels) has a bevelled edge (412).
5. Locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the locking cam each have an opening
(22) for fixation of the spring (30) of each of the locking cams.
6. Locking apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the beam (3) in each channel is provided with a cavity (31) underneath each of the locking cams, so that the spring (30) for each locking cam can be completely inserted.
7. Locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the spring (30) for each locking cam has a limited torque. 


 . claims, characterized in that the curvature of the eccentric depends on the type of string (plain or wound) that has to be locked by it. 9. Locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the locking cams (20, 23-27) are oriented substantially vertical relative to the beam (3).
10. Locking cam for use in a locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, the locking bit being laser cut from spring steel.
11. Beam provided with one or two U-shaped channels, destined for a locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, the beam (3) being made from quench quality steel RUS and being quenched to approximately 60 HRc. 12. Beam provided with one or two U-shaped channels, destined for a locking apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, the beam being dimensioned in such a way that the distance between the channels corresponds with the standard spacing between the strings of the stringed instrument and the length of the beam (3) does not exceed the width of the neck of the stringed instrument, to which the beam is mounted.
13. Stringed instrument including a locking apparatus accord¬ ing to one of the preceding claims and at the same time provided with a tremolo, fixed to the other side of the strings opposite the side anchored to the locking apparatus.
