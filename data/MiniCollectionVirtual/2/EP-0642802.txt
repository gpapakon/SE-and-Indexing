<ABSTRACT>
The medical inhalation device is used for generating an aerodispersion of pharmaceutically active substances for intake via the respiratory tract. It comprises a storage vessel (1) for the pharmaceutically active substance present in liquid form, a conveying device (2) for ejection of the liquid from the storage vessel (1), a vibration generator (3) and a transfer line (4) for the liquid arranged between the storage vessel (1) and the vibration generator (3). The conveying device (2) and the vibration generator (3) can both be controlled via a sequential control device (15) in the form of a microprocessor. The ejection of medicinal liquid, which can be accurately metered and is coordinated with the vibration generator (3), effects optimal atomisation of the medicament.

<CLAIMS>
Medical inhalation apparatus for generating an
aero-dispersion of pharmaceutically active substances

to be taken in via the respiratory tract, having a
storage container (1) for the pharmaceutically active

substance, which is present in liquid form, a conveyor
device (2) for expelling the liquid from the storage

container (1), an ultrasonic atomiser (3) and a
transfer line (4) for the liquid that is arranged

between the storage container (1) and the ultrasonic
atomiser (3), the inhalation apparatus having a

sequence control (15) with which the conveyor device
(2) and the ultrasonic atomiser (3) can be controlled,

characterised in that the transfer line (4) has at its
end (6) which faces the ultrasonic atomiser (3) an

opening (7) made in the casing of the transfer line
(4), which opening is closed by an elastic membrane

(8).
Inhalation apparatus according to claim 1,
characterised in that the sequence control (15) is a

microprocessor.
Inhalation apparatus according to claim 1 or
2, characterised in that the sequence control (15) is

programmable.
Inhalation apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the transfer line

(4) has the opening (7) at the side, which opening is
closed in the form of a rubber tube pulled over the end

(6) of the transfer line (4).
Inhalation apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the ultrasonic

atomiser (3), preferably by means of a piezoelectric
vibration system, generates ultrasonic bending

vibrations.
Inhalation apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the storage 

container (1) comprises a spray ampoule (10) having a
movable piston (11).
Inhalation apparatus according to claim 6,
characterised in that there is provided a threaded rod

(13) which engages in the piston (11) and has at the
end facing away from the piston (11) a connector (17)

for connection to a gearing (28).
Inhalation apparatus according to claim 7,
characterised in that the storage container (1) with

spray ampoule (10), the transfer line (4) and the
threaded rod (13) containing the connector (17) are

together constructed as a separate dosing unit (21),
which can be put into and removed from a housing (22)

containing the conveyor device (2), the ultrasonic
atomiser (3) and the sequence control (15).
Inhalation apparatus according to one of claims
6 to 8, characterised in that the storage container (1)

containing the spray ampoule (10) is provided with an
adapter head (18) which surrounds the transfer line

the storage container (1) in such a way that the end

(23) of the transfer line (4) that faces the storage
container (1) penetrates an ampoule membrane (24) of

the spray ampoule (10) and medicament liquid can flow
from the spray ampoule (10) into the transfer line (4).
Inhalation apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the conveyor

device (2) and the ultrasonic atomiser (3) can be

activated simultaneously.
Inhalation apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the conveyor

device (2) can be activated with a time delay with
respect to the ultrasonic atomiser (3).
Inhalation apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the ultrasonic

atomiser (3) can be activated with a time delay with
respect to the conveyor device (2).
