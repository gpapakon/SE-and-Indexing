<ABSTRACT>
The biocompatibility of various polymers are improved by blending with them a polymer including a zwitterionic groups. The zwitterionic group is usually an ammonium phosphate ester zwitterionic group and the polymer containing it may be produced by the free radical polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers including a monomer bearing the zwitterionic group. Blending of the two polymers may be achieved by dry blending particulate polymers or by mixing the polymers in liquid dispersion or solution followed by removal of the liquid medium. The fibrinogen absorption and/or platelet activation of polymers may be reduced to a value of less than 80 % or even less than 60 % of the base polymer by introducing amounts of more than 10 % or more than 30 % of the zwitterionic group containing polymer. Preferred blends are of copolymers of 2-(methacryloyloxyethyl)-2'-(trimethylammonium)ethyl phosphate inner salt with higher alkyl (meth) acrylate, blended with olefin polymers and/or with rubber latices. The products may be used in medical devices in which they come into contact with bodily fluids, especially blood, plasma, serum and/or tear film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new polymeric
materials, especially suitable for use in biomedical
applications, processes for their production, articles
formed from such materials and processes for modifying the
physical and biological properties of plastic materials.The medical device industry frequently employs a range
of thermoplastic, elastomeric and thermoset materials in
medical devices. Many of these polymers were originally
developed as engineering materials and their physical and
mechanical properties reflect this. Thus a plastic may be
employed as a medical device because it posseses physical
and mechanical properties suitable for use in a biological
environment. However, until recently little attention was
paid to the biological properties of these materials. This
has resulted in a number of problems with current device
materials as a result of adverse biological reactions.
Silicone rubbers have been shown to leach toxic silicones
when implanted, polyurethanes have been found to degrade by
macrophage attack and natural rubbers have caused severe
allergic reactions. In addition, PVC, a widely used
polymer for medical devices, often contains large
quantities of the plasticiser bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate
and many studies now show this to be toxic. It is clear,
therefore, that many materials possess properties which
render them unsuitable for use in biological applications.Previous attempts to prepare biocompatible materials
have mimicked the surface of platelet cells which under
normal circumstances exist in the blood without causing any
adverse reactions. These cell membranes comprise a
phospholipid bilayer with the phosphorylcholine group
dominating the external membrane surface. It is believed
this outer surface avoids adverse reaction with other
biological components. Lipids containing phosphorylcholine
groups have been coated on to the surface of device
materials and bloodclotting studies showed that they 
rendered the surface more biocompatible (J A Hayward & D
Chapman, Biomaterials, Vol. 5, 135, 1984). These
phospholipids have also been used as plasticisers in
commercial polymers and have again improved the
biocompatibility of the base material (WO-A-87/02684).
However these two approaches nevertheless possess
disadvantages.Coating the surface of a finished device has a number
of problems, one being the difficulty in coating devices
with complex shapes or multiple components; in practice a
multi-component device can be impossible to coat. In
addition the degree of biocompatibility is
