<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to improved polyepoxide resins having enhanced 
physical and elastic properties. The polyepoxide resins comprise an 

polyepoxide resin based on a polyglycidyl ether of a phenolic type compound 
and an acrylate terminated urethane prepolymer. The improvement in the 

polyepoxide resin formulation comprises incorporating an aliphatic, 
aliphatic ether or ester component having monofunctional reactivity with an 

amine hydrogen and an amine curative having from 3 to 10, and preferably 3 
to 5 epoxide reactive hydrogen atoms into the epoxy resin. The presence of 

the monofunctional and aliphatic amine reactive component along with the 
acrylate terminated urethane prepolymer results in an epoxy resin having 

the enhanced properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to epoxy resins having enhanced flexibility 
and elongation. Civil engineering and industrial coating industries require 
economical, environmentally safe resin systems which cure at ambient 
temperature and give good elastomeric properties without compromising the 
moisture and chemical resistance. Concrete structures, for example, 
require coatings which are able to withstand impact as well as cover 
shrinkage-induced cracks which may be present therein. Aromatic polyepoxide resins, particularly those based upon the use of 
polyglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A, have widely been used for preparing 
cast resins and coatings for civil engineering applications. Some of the 
reasons for success of epoxy resins in these applications due to their 
moisture and chemical resistance as well as their ability to bond to a 
variety of substrates. When the polyepoxide resins are cured with 
polyamides, the resins, although resistant to chemicals, generally lack 
elasticity for a multitude of applications and when cured with amines, the 
polyepoxide resins lose their flexibility and impact strength. Historically, flexibility in an epoxy resin formulation has been 
obtained through the use of coal tar or similar additives. Flexibility has 
also been imparted to an ambient cured epoxy by making gross changes in the 
cured epoxy structure. These changes have been accomplished by : (1) 
modifying the aromatic character to a more aliphatic character; (2) 
reducing the cross-link density by using a curative with lower 
functionality or using a high excess of curative; and (3) adding long chain 
modifiers or flexibilizers in the form of resin, curative, or reactive 
additive. To achieve flexibilization of the epoxy resin pursuant to method 
3, often flexibilizers in excess of sixty percent by weight of the 
formulation may be required or plasticizers such as nonylphenol or benzyl  
 
alcohol may be used to reduce the concentration of flexibilizer. The use 
of plasticizers leads, of course, to the presence of fugitive materials. Representative patents which describe polyepoxide resins and the 
approach to enhancing the physical properties of the polyepoxide resins are 
as follows:
 
   German DE 3,536,246 A1 discloses the use of acrylic and methacrylic 
acid derivatives of urethane prepolymers as flexibilization agents for 
epoxide resin systems. The patentees disclose the reaction of hydroxy 
alkyl esters of methacrylic acid or acrylic acid and an isocyanate 
prepolymer, e.g.
