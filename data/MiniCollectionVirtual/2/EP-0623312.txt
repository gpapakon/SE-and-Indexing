<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
surgical stapler of the type which includes a staple 
cartridge having a plurality of staple drive members in 
association with surgical staples which are designed to 
be driven by longitudinal movement of cam means for 
firing the surgical staples into body tissue. The drive 
members of the present cartridge can be configured to 
drive three laterally adjacent rows of staples. Surgical staplers have found wide-spread 
acceptance in surgical procedures since such devices 
drastically reduce the amount of time required by 
surgeons to suture body tissue. Typically, such surgical staplers have a pair 
of upper and lower jaw members to clamp body tissue 
therebetween. The lower jaw member typically carries a 
staple cartridge which contains a plurality of staple 
drive members having cam contact surfaces in association 
with one or more laterally spaced rows of surgical 
staples. The upper jaw member has an anvil portion to 
close the surgical staples which have passed through 
body tissue. The stapler is further provided with at 
least one pusher bar longitudinally moveable relative to 
the jaw members and having a cam surface for engaging 
the cam contact surfaces of the staple drive members so 
that the longitudinal movement of the pusher bar 
sequentially drives the staple drive members, through a 
camming action, to fire surgical staples from the 
cartridge. For some uses, double-row stapling is 
preferable to single-row stapling in providing secure 
hemostasis. Accordingly, some currently available 
surgical staplers include double staple drive members  
 
respectively formed of a single piece construction 
having two staple driving surfaces for firing two rows 
of surgical staples. These double staple drive members 
are longitudinally arranged in a row within the 
cartridge to be driven with a single stroke of the 
pusher bar. Typical arrangements include double staple 
drive members each having a longitudinally-staggered 
pair of staple driving surfaces which bridge the pusher 
bar path. U.S. Patent No. 4,978,049, to Green, 
which constitutes the prior art document on which the two-part 
forms of claims 1 and 12 are based, 
discloses 
a modification which includes triple staple drive 
members respectively formed of a single piece 
construction having three laterally spaced staple 
driving surfaces capable of firing three rows of 
surgical staples. However, this arrangement has 
distinct disadvantages. As the number of the staple driving surfaces
