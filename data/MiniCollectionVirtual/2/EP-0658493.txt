<ABSTRACT>
A packaging case (2) includes a case body (8) for storing 
a wrap film (6) and a lid (10) continuously formed with the top 

edge portion of a rear wall (16) of the case body. Flap 
pieces (32) extend outward to be pivotal on the top edge 

portions of side walls (18) of the case body. Stepped 
portions (24a,b) engaged with the flap pieces to prevent 

floating of the lid are formed on the inner surfaces of 
lid side walls covered on the side walls of the main 

body during closing of the lid. Predetermined portions (54) 
of the side walls of the main body continuous with the 

flap pieces are made thinner than remaining portions (56) of 
the side walls. The inner surfaces of the remaining 

portions are located inside the inner surfaces of the 
predetermined portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a case for
packaging a wrap film, an aluminum foil, paper or the
like which is rolled on a cylindrical core.Various conventional wrap film cases are known.
Generally, each case comprises a case body for storing
a rolled wrap film, and a lid integrally formed with
the case body, as described in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 63-55043 and 64-9151. In use of such a
conventional case, the following operations are
generally performed. A user opens the lid upward and
pulls the wrap film from the case body by a desired
length. The wrap film is then cut with a cutter
mounted on the bottom wall of the case body or the
front wall of the lid.However, in a general conventional wrap film case,
as a case body is simply covered with a lid, the lid
may float to externally expose the opening portion of
the case body, depending on a way of handling the case.
To expose the opening portion of the case body is not
preferable from the sanitary viewpoint or may cause the
wrap film to drop from the case body. In addition, 
while the lid is kept floating, the free end of the
wrap film may be rewound into the case body to make it
difficult to pull the wrap film in re-use.To solve the above problem, there is proposed a
conventional packaging case having a lid floating
preventive function, as described in Japanese Utility
Model Laid-Open No. 4-89732
(≡ JP-A-2206546).
This case has flap pieces
extending downward on the outer sides of top edge
portions of right and left side walls of case body, and
stepped portions projecting inward on the inner
surfaces of right and left side walls of a lid. When
the case body is capped by the lid, the flap pieces
engage with the stepped portions to prevent the lid
from floating.In the case described in Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open No. 4-89732, desired effects cannot be
obtained because the flap pieces and the stepped
portion are respectively formed on the case body and
the lid without devices. To smoothly open/close the
lid, the flap pieces must be movable inward in the case
body during the opening/closing operation of the lid.
In the conventional case described above, however, the
flap pieces can rarely be moved inward in the case body
because a space between each end portion of a wrap film
core stored inside the case body and the corresponding
side wall which supports the corresponding flap piece 
is very small or absent. For this reason, after the
lid is closed and the flap pieces are engaged with the
stepped portions, respectively, it is difficult to
separat
