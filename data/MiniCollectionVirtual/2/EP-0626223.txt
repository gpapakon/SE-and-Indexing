<ABSTRACT>
In a cushioning device (42) of a press having a pneumatic 
cylinder (32) for producing a blank-holding force (Fs) to be 

applied to a blank (40) through a cushion platen (26) and a 
pressure ring (28), an optimum initial value (Po) of the 

pneumatic pressure of the pneumatic cylinder when the 
cushion platen is placed at a setup position lower than the 

lower stroke end is calculated based on die-set information 
relating to the pressure ring and including a predetermined 

optimum value (Fso) of the blank-holding force, and machine 
information relating to the cushioning device, so that the 

calculated optimum initial pneumatic pressure provides the 
optimum blank-holding force during a pressing operation, 

irrespective of a volumetric increase of the pneumatic 
cylinder due to a movement of the cushion platen from the 

setup position to an operating position for the pressing 
operation. The pneumatic pressure (Pa) is adjusted to the 

calculated optimum initial value (Po) when the cushion 
platen is located at the setup position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
cushioning device for a press, and more particularly to a 
method and an apparatus for establishing an optimum 
pneumatic pressure in a cushioning pneumatic cylinder 
adapted to bias a cushion platen in an upward direction. A press adapted to effect a drawing operation on a 
blank is generally equipped with a cushioning device which 
includes (a) a cushion platen supporting a pressure member 
and (b) a cushioning pneumatic cylinder for biasing the 
cushion platen in an upward direction. The cushioning device 
is constructed to apply a blank-holding force to the 
pressure member to hold the blank placed on the pressure 
member, based on a pneumatic pressure of the cushioning 
pneumatic cylinder. An example of such a press is 
disclosed in laid-open Publication No. 62-20711 (published 
in 1987) of unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application (This 
document serves as basis for the precharacterising portion of the 
independent claims 1 and 10). 
Usually, the pneumatic pressure of the cushioning pneumatic 
cylinder is adjusted so as to obtain an intended product  
 
from the blank, in a try-and-error procedure by performing 
test pressing operations each time a die set used on the 
press is changed. However, the adjustment of the pneumatic pressure 
in the try-and-error procedure as described above is not 
only cumbersome and time-consuming, but also requires a 
relatively high level of skill of the operator and suffers 
from difficulty in producing pressed articles with 
consistently high quality. In view of this drawback, the 
assignee of the present application proposed a method of 
automatically adjusting the pneumatic pressure of the 
cushioning pneumatic cylinder to an optimum value suitable 
for the intended product, on the basis of die-set 
information indicative of specifications of a die set used, 
and machine information indicative of specification of the 
press in question, as disclosed in co-pending Application No. 
EP-A-566 308 published after the priority date of the present 
application. Described more specifically by reference to 
Fig. 1, an optimum value Pax of a pneumatic pressure Pa of a 
cushioning pneumatic cylinder 32 used in a press shown in 
the figure is calculated according to the following equation 
(1), and the pneumatic pressure Pa is adjusted to the 
calculated optimum value Pax by suitably controlling a 
pneumatic pressure control circuit 38 and a shut-off valve 
37 while the actual pneumatic pressure Pa is detected by a 
pneumat
