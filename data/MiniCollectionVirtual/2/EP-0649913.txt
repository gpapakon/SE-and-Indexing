<ABSTRACT>
The steel contains, by weight, from 0.35 to 0.8 % of nitrogen and from 1 to 5 % of tungsten. The chemical composition of the steel preferably comprises, in weight contents, 23 to 28 % of Cr, 15 to 28 % of Ni, 0.5 to 6 % of Mn, from 3 to 8 % of Mo, in addition to the nitrogen and tungsten. As a result of its high corrosion resistance the steel can be employed for the manufacture of massive components for any application, especially for the manufacture of equipment for oil platforms and for chemical factories, of containers for the transport of corrosive products, of ships' hulls and of plated sheets.
