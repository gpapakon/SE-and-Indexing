having high corrosion resistance and workability used in an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine for, 

for example, an automobile or a ship. Steel of a high corrosion resistance and steel of high corrosion resistance and 
processability in which not less than 0.01 % and less than 1.2% of Si, 0.1-1.5 % of Mn, 2.5-9.9 % of Cr and more 

than 3.0 % and up to 8.0 % of Al are contained; C, P, S and N are reduced to not more than 0.02%, not more than 
0.03 %, not more than 0.01 % and not more than 0.02 % respectively; a total of 0.01-0.5 % of a combination of Nb, 

V, Ti, Zr, Ta and Hf is contained; a condition expression is satisfied; not less than one kind of element out of Cu, 
Mo, Sb, Ni, W, rare earth elements and Ca is contained; and the rest consists of Fe and unavoidable impurities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steel having 
excellent corrosion resistance and a steel having 
excellent corrosion resistance and workability. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a steel 
having excellent corrosion resistance in exhaust systems 
of, for example, internal combustion engines in 
automobiles and ships and a steel which is excellent in 
corrosion resistance as well as in workability required 
for working he steel into components. A steel comprising a common steel plated with 
aluminum or zinc for the purpose of avoiding internal or 
external corrosion has hitherto been used in an exhaust 
system of internal combustion engines including those of 
automobiles from the viewpoint of preventing the steel 
from being internally or externally corroded. In order 
to prevent environmental pollution, however, a catalyst 
or the like has been provided for exhaust gas 
purification purposes in an exhaust system, rendering the 
corrosion resistance of the above plated steel product 
unsatisfactory. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(Kokai) Nos. 63-143240, 63-143241, and 2-156048 and the 
like disclose steels containing 3 to 12% of Cr for 
improving the corrosion resistance of a steel substrate 
in an exhaust system. Prolongation of the period of 
service and the term of guarantee of vehicles in recent 
years has led to extensive use of a high grade stainless 
steel containing Cr in an amount up to about 18% and/or 
Mo in an exhaust system. Even such a stainless steel 
often undergoes pitting type local corrosion, and, hence,  
 
the corrosion-resistance thereof is not always 
satisfactory. Further, since the above stainless steel 
contains large amounts of Cr and Mo, they have poor 
workability, making it very difficult to produce members 
having a complicate shape, for examples, those for an 
exhaust system. This complicates the production process, 
entailing increased working cost. Furthermore, the above 
stainless steel cannot be worked into some shapes and, at 
the same time, brings about increased material cost. A steel incorporating a certain amount of Cr, which 
is a representative example of a steel used in the above 
exhaust system, is likely to unfavorably undergo local 
corrosion when exposed to an aggressive environment. In 
order to solve this problem, it is common practice to 
increase the Cr or Mo content to improving the corrosion 
resistance. In view of the above problems, the present invention 
has been made to provide a steel which has high 
resistance to
