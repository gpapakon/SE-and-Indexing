<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of olefinically unsaturated isocyanates containing urethane groups by reaction of   a) an isocyanate component, consisting essentially of urethane group-free cycloaliphatic diisocyanates with b) an unsaturated alcohol component, consisting essentially of monohydric, olefinically unsaturated alcohols or mixtures of alcohols of this type while maintaining an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 4 to 40 and subsequent distillative removal of distillable, unreacted starting isocyanates, the isocyanates thus obtainable and their use as binders for coating materials to be processed at room temperature as a single component.

Process for the preparation of olefinically 
unsaturated, urethane group-exhibiting isocyanates 

having an NCO content of from 4 to 20 wt-% and an 
(average) NCO functionality of from 0.6 to 1.5, 

characterised in that 

a) an isocyanate component having an NCO content of 
from 20 to 56 wt-% and an (average) NCO 

functionality of less than 2.5, comprising 
substantially 


a1) from 80 to 100 wt-% of urethane group-free 
cycloaliphatic diisocyanates having an NCO 

content of from 25 to 56 wt-% and 
a2) from 0 to 20 wt-% of other organic 
polyisocyanates having an NCO content of 

from 10 to 50 wt-% 
 
is reacted with 
b) an olefinically unsaturated alcohol component 
having an (average) hydroxyl functionality of 

less than 1.5 and an iodine number greater than 
70, comprising substantially 


b1) from 80 to 100 wt-% of monohydric 
olefinically unsaturated alcohols or 

mixtures of such alcohols having (on 
average) 10 to 22 carbon atoms per molecule 

and 
b2) from 0 to 20 wt-% of other mono- or 
polyhydric alcohols within the molecular 

weight range 32 to 326, 
  
 

optionally in the presence of catalysts for the NCO/OH 
addition reaction, maintaining an NCO/OH equivalent 

ratio of from 4 to 40, and excess distillable starting 
isocyanates a1) and/or a2) are subsequently removed by 

distillation from the reaction products, down to a 
maximum residual content of such isocyanates of 0.5%. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
exclusively cycloaliphatic diisocyanates a1) are used 

as component a). 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that exclusively 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethyl 

cyclohexane is used as component a). 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that exclu
sively fatty alcohols or mixtures of fatty 
alcohols having an iodine number greater than 90 and 

(on average) 14 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule are 
used as component b). 
Olefinically unsaturated isocyanates obtainable 
according to Claims 1 to 4. 
Use of the olefinically unsaturated isocyanates 
obtainable according to Claims 1 to 4 as binders for 

coating materials to be worked at room temperature as 
one-pot materials.
