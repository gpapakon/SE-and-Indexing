<ABSTRACT>
Garment produced from a single piece of fabric made from any material whatsoever, characterised in that it is obtained by virtue of a T-shaped cutout which enables it to be divided into three integral panels, two panels cut out side by side and a wide rear panel. This rear panel, forming the back of the garment, is equipped on each side with a fastening (lace, cord or Velcro) which allows it the possibility of being knotted on the two front panels. This process gives rise to the formation of two full sleeves of "kimono" type and thus creates a garment which is worn as a bath robe which is quick to slip on and comfortable.
