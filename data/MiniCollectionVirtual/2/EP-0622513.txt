<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to reduce the mechanical losses in a motor-gear drive unit with the coupling of transmission via the gear to a drive shaft (3) by means of an emergency actuation facility (47) and with a casing (1, 2) which is split in two axially, while nevertheless simplifying assembly and manufacture, the drive shaft (3) and a worm wheel (5) which drives the latter in service are rotatably mounted only on a first part (1) of the casing and the drive shaft (3) is connected only by an axial coupling (31-34, 41-44) - with coaxial play - to a drive shaft (4), likewise subject to emergency actuation, which is connected, for transmission, to the worm wheel (5) by concentric toothing (45), the connection being disengageable by means of the emergency actuation facility (47) by axial displacement.

Engine-gearbox power unit with gearbox transmission, 
which can be disconnected by an emergency 

activation, to an output shaft (3), in particular for a 
sliding roof in a motor vehicle, having the features: 


a) the gearbox housing is divided in the axial direction 
of the drive shaft (4) into a first housing 

component (1) and into a second housing component 
(2); 
b) the output shaft (3) projects through an axial 
opening in the first housing component (1); 
c) a drive shaft (4) which can be adjusted axially for 
the purpose of emergency activation projects through 

an axial opening in the second housing component 
(2); 
d) the output shaft (3) and the output gear, for 
example a worm gear (5), of the gearbox are rotatably 

mounted only in the first housing component (1); 
e) the drive shaft (4) and the output shaft (3) have a 
continuous drive-connection via an axially 

displaceable clutch connection which permits both an 
axial adjustment and a coaxial play between the 

drive shaft (4) and the output shaft (3); 
f) the drive shaft (4) is operatively connected in a 
geared manner, by means of a toothing (45) which is 

concentric with respect to the drive shaft, to a 
corresponding toothing of the output gear of the 

gearbox, independently of the clutch connection; 
g) the geared connection between the drive shaft (4) 
and the output gear can be eliminated by axially 

displacing the drive shaft (4) during the emergency  
 

activation. 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to Claim 1, 
having the feature:
 
h) the drive shaft (4) is provided on the output shaft 

side with radially protruding claws (41-44) which 
dip in an axially displaceable fashion into corresponding 

claw pockets (31-34) of the output shaft 
(3). 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
i) the drive shaft (4) and the output shaft (3) are 

clamped one against the other, with axially external 
bracing against the second housing component (2) or 

against the first housing component (1), respectively, 
by means of an axial compression spring (10) 

which preferably dips into an axial recess (35) of 
the output shaft (3). 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
j) the output gear, for example a worm gear (5), is 

rotatably mounted on an axial bearing sleeve extension 
(11) of the first housing component (1). 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
k) the output shaft (3) is mounted in the first housing 

component (1) by means of an axially extending 
flange bushing, for example sintered bushing (8). 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
l) the drive shaft (4) is radially supported, in a 

contact-free manner with respect to the second 
housing component (2), exclusively by means of its 

toothing (45) in the output gear, in particular of 
a worm gear (5), and by means of its claws (41-44) 

in the claw pockets (31-34), respectively. 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
m) the first housing component (1) is a pot-shaped  

 
construction and can be closed by means of a housing 

lid as the second housing component (2). 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
n) the components of the power unit can be assembled 

using axial plug-type assembly technology. 
Engine-gearbox power unit according to one of the 
preceding claims, with the feature:
 
o) the output shaft (3) and the drive shaft (4) consist 

of sintered metal.
