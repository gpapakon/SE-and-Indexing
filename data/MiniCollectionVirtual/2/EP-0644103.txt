<ABSTRACT>
A reinforcement configuration is provided for an 
automotive body panel (12) which is particularly useful in 

the reinforcement of vertical planar surfaces through which 
tooling holes are formed. In the reinforcement, a 

depression (16) is formed about a tooling hole (14) which 
includes certain lower surfaces (15) formed to avoid the 

funnelling of liquid coating such as paint which are 
typically applied to the vertically extending surface and 

the production of automotive vehicle bodies. Funnelling is 
prevented either through providing a surface dispersing 

vertically running paint or by providing a reservoir for 
collecting vertically running paint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
painting of automotive body panels and to configurations for 
stamping such panels. In the manufacture of motor vehicles it is necessary 
to locate and measure body panels during the assembly 
process. One method for effecting such measurement consists 
of using a local surface discontinuity, such as a tooling 
hole, as a locating surface to position the panel on the 
vehicle frame, as well as to determine panel and component 
dimensional tolerances relative to the tooling hole. 
However, there are drawbacks associated with use of tooling 
holes, one of which is a weakening of the local area of the 
panel. To regain strength and stiffness adjacent such a 
tooling hole a reinforcing circular depression encompassing 
the hole is often stamped into the sheet metal, e.g. as described in 
US patent 5 133 206. This can 
present problems, however, when a liquid surface coating 
such as paint is applied to the panel as part of the 
automotive assembly process. When the stamped depression is 
located on a vertical surface lower portions of the 
depression act as a funnel, collecting paint at its lower 
edge which in turn begins to drip out of the depression 
causing an imperfection in the form of a paint run. To 
remove these imperfections the area must be hand sanded and 
the application of a second coat of paint must be carefully 
monitored. This adversely affects the time and cost of the 
vehicle assembly process. One approach to preventing paint runs is illustrated 
in U.S Patent 5,104,682 to Nakahama et al. in which a four 
step paint application process is disclosed. In an effort 
to reduce paint runs the disclosed process requires rotation 
of the vehicle body about its horizontal longitudinal axis 
at a rate such that "the paint sprayed is not caused to move 
to a large extent due to gravity." Implementation of the 
four step process is economically impractical for the mass 
production of vehicles because the process is time  
 
consuming, and costly. It requires a large initial 
investment for equipment to rotate the vehicle, adds steps 
to the assembly process, and requires more employee 
supervision. DE-A 1 530 597 describes an automotive body panel 
having a row of fixing holes for a trim member in which a 
horizontally extending groove is formed in the panel below 
and close to the row of holes to receive and distribute 
excess paint. A similar groove may be formed above the row 
of holes. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a

<CLAIMS>
A reinforcement for an automotive body panel 
positioned in vertically extending orientation for receiving 

a liquid surface coating thereon, the body panel including 
a generally vertically extending surface (12), the 

reinforcement comprising a depression (16) in the surface 
(12) having an inner surrounding edge (17) and an outer 

surrounding edge (18), characterised in that the depression 
(16) is tombstone-shaped with its lower edge (18) being 

generally horizontal. 
A reinforcement according to claim 1, wherein the 
reinforcement includes a tooling hole (14) and the 

depression (16) generally symmetrically surrounds the 
tooling hole (14). 
A reinforcement according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the lower edges (17, 18) of the depression define a 

horizontally extending canted non-funnelling surface (15) 
operative to disperse the liquid surface coating to avoid 

paint funnelling to the surface (12) beneath the reinforcing 
depression (16). 
A reinforcement according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the area between the generally horizontal lower 

edges (17, 18) of the depression forms a reservoir (19) 
operative to contain paint and to prevent paint runs on to 

the panel surface (12) from the application of paint on the 
body panel.
