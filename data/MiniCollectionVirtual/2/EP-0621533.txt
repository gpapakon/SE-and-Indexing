<ABSTRACT>
A barrel shifter capable of shifting input data in both directions, left and right, without increasing its circuit scale. In a barrel 
shifter unit circuit of a plural-stage barrel shifter, provided are a tristate buffer (11X) for left-shifting and a tristate buffer 

(12X) for right-shifting. Either the tristate buffer (11X) or the tristate buffer (12X) is forced into operation by a left and right 
shifting signal (DS) applied to the input terminals for the left and right shifting signal. Therefore, by the left and right shifting 

signal (DS), a data transferring path is changed from an input terminal (IX) to an input/output line (10X) or (13X), and the setting 
of the left or the right shifting is possible. Also, when by address signals given to address terminals A0-A3, a shifting quantity 

is set, the input data can be shifted by the set shifting quantity and outputted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a barrel-shifter which is used for a
numeric data processor etc. and is capable of shifting input data by
arbitrary bits in either direction of left and right.There have been barrel-shifters of this kind, for example, that
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 60 - 236197.As described in the above reference, the barrel-shifter is a circuit for
shifting input data over by desired digits at a time in response to the input
data at need, and examples of arrangement thereof are shown in Figs. 13
to 16.Fig. 13 is a block diagram exemplifying an arrangement of a
conventional right shift 4 - bit barrel-shifter.The right shift 4 - bit barrel-shifter comprises four-staged barrel-shifter
unit circuits (bit slice) 10 to 13 each having a data length of 4 bits
which are connected to one another at each input/output terminal
(referred to as an i/o terminal hereinafter) thereof by way of data lines 15.
Each of barrel-shifter unit circuits 10 to 13 is designed to be set in shifting
amount thereof depending to the address signal produced by a decoder 20.Fig. 14 is a circuit diagram showing an example of arrangement of
each of the barrel-shifter unit circuits 10 to 13 having a data length of 4
bits in Fig. 13.. The barrel-shifter unit circuit having a data length of 4 bits
constitutes a bit using a n-channel MOS transistor. That is, the barrel-shifter
unit circuit comprises an input terminal I, address terminals A0
to A3 coupled to the output side of the decoder 20, i/o terminals I0 to I3 for
coupling the barrel-shifter unit circuits to one another by way of data lines
15, an output terminal O, an input side inverter 29, transfer gates 30 to 33
each composed of an n-channel MOS transistor, a pull-up p-channel MOS
transistor 34 coupled to a source potential Vcc and an output side inverter
35.The input terminal I is coupled to the i/o terminal I0 by way of the
inverter 29. The address terminals A0 to A3 are coupled to the gate
electrodes of the transfer gates 30 to 33 respectively. The transfer gates 30
to 33 are respectively coupled to the i/o terminals I0 to I3 at one terminals
thereof and are coupled in common to the input portion of the output side
inverter 35 at the other terminals thereof. The output portion of the output
side inverter 35 is coupled to the output terminal O.The operation of the right shift 4 - bit barrel-shifter having the above
arrangement will be described hereinafter.In Fig. 13, 4 - bit input data DI0 to DI3 input to the input terminals I
