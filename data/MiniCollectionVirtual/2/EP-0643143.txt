<ABSTRACT>
Ultrafine whiskery or columnar ceramic particles, a 
method for producing the ultrafine particles, and a sintered 

article obtained by sintering the ultrafine ceramic particles 
are disclosed. The ultrafine ceramic particles are produced 

by thermally melting a matrix alloy of a composition of Al-M¹, 
wherein M¹ stands for at least one metallic element selected 

from the group consisting of Cr, Co, and Fe, or Al-M¹-M², 
wherein M² stands for at least one metallic element selected 

from the group consisting of Au, Cu, Dy, Er, Ga, Ge, Gd, Hf, 
Ho, Lu, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pr, Re, Sb, Sc, Si, Sn, Ta, Tb, 

Ti, Tm, V, W, Y, Zn, or Zr, in a nitriding atmosphere 
containing nitrogen and causing the vaporized raw material to 

react with the nitrogen in the atmosphere. By this method, 
ultrafine composite particles or a mixture comprising 

ultrafine whiskery or columnar aluminum nitride particles and 
ultrafine particles of the metal, the intermetallic compound 

of the metal with aluminum, and the nitride ceramic of the 
metal are produced. The ultrafine particles thus obtained 

find extensive utility as sintering materials and dispersion 
materials, for example.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composite ultrafine particles
of nitrides having a whiskery or columnar structure, a method
for the production thereof, and a sintered article obtained by
sintering a powder containing the ultrafine particles.The sintered articles of metal nitrides such as, for
example, aluminum nitride are widely used in various
applications as to heat-releasing substrates for semi-conductors,
printed circuit boards, packaging materials for
LSI (large scale integrated circuit), light-pervious heat-resistant
materials, etc. because they are possessed of
resistance to heat, high thermal conductivity, high electrical
insulating quality, and light transmission property. Though
these sintered articles of metal nitrides are generally
produced by sintering a nitride powder, the properties of the
sintered articles thus obtained are appreciably affected by
the purity and the particle diameter of a particular powder
used as the raw material. The production of a sintered
article of high performance, therefore, necessitates the use
of a very fine nitride powder of high purity. When such fine
ceramic particles are used as a dispersive reinforcing
material in a particle-dispersed composite material, they are 
desired to be very slender particles having a whiskery or
columnar structure.In the production of such ultrafine particles of a metal
nitride as mentioned above by the arc plasma method, for
example, it is difficult to obtain the ultrafine nitride
particles unless the nitride uses such a metal as titanium or
zirconium which has strong affinity for nitrogen. The
ultrafine particles of TiN or ZrN, however, are at a
disadvantage in being producible only in an extremely low
yield (about 10 mg/min.).When aluminum or chromium reputed to produce ultrafine
nitride particles in a relatively high yield is used as a
vaporizing material, all the produced particles are not
nitrided; they are nitrided only up to about 30% in the case
of aluminum or about 40% in the case of chromium. Thus,
ultrafine particles containing metal and ceramic phases (Al +
30% AlN or Cr + 40% β -Cr2N) are produced.In view of this destitution, a method for producing a
very fine aluminum nitride powder by melting metallic aluminum
with an arc or plasma in the atmosphere of a mixed gas
consisting of nitrogen and ammonia thereby preparing a very
fine mixed powder of metallic aluminum and aluminum nitride
and subsequently heating the mixed powder at a high
temperature in an atmosphere of nitrogen thereby nitriding the
very fine metallic
