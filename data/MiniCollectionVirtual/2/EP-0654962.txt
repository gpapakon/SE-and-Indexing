<ABSTRACT>
A screening element for improving the electromagnetic compatibility of electrical, in particular electronic, functional groups which are at least partially surrounded by electrically conductive screening housing walls or contain printed circuit boards which have electrically conductive screening regions, the screening element forming an intermediate element for sealed, conductive bridging of such screening regions, whose longitudinal extent is large in comparison with its cross-section, which is designed in particular in the manner of a profiled seal, and an essentially rigid supporting element is provided which has at least one compressible or elastic layer which is composed of conductive material and is fitted directly on one of its longitudinally directed covering surfaces.

Arrangement of two stacked conductive plates having a shielding member, serving as an intermediate layer, for enhancing the electromagnetic compatibility of electrical, especially electronic, function groups, which contain the conductive plates (2, 4, 2', 4'), the conductive plates having electrically-conductive shielding areas, the shielding member in the form of a shielding frame or a shielding strip forming an intermediate element for sealingly and conductively bridging said shielding areas, the longitudinal extent of the intermediate element being large compared to the dimensions of its cross-section, which in particular is shaped in the form of a profile seal, wherein the shielding member comprises a substantially rigid carrier element (1, 1', 11 to 19, 910 to 912), which has at least one compressible or resilient layer (8, 8', 81-89, 810a-813b) or a corresponding strip, of electrically-conductive material applied directly to one of its outer longitudinal surfaces, the electrically-conductive material being a silicon polymer that dries at air and room temperature and wherein at least one resilient or compressible layer or a compressible strip (81 to 89) is made up, at least in part, of a plurality of part-layers or part-strips (81a to 89c).
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the compressible, or resilient, layer (8, 8', 81 to 89; 810a to 813b) covers the surface of the substantially rigid carrier element (1; 1'; 11 to 19; 910 to 912) in a strip-like configuration.
Arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 a respective resilient, or compressible, layer or strip is formed on opposing surfaces of the carrier element (1; 1'; 11 to 19; 910 to 912), these layers or strips being connected to each other in an electrically-conductive manner.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the carrier element (1; 1'; 11 to 19; 119, 910 to 912) consists of a metallised plastic or a plastic combined with a conductive component, and/or of a non-conductive material, and that in an edge region of the carrier element a layer (811) is formed which engages connectingly around the carrier element and at least partially covers the opposing surfaces and/or contains openings which connect the opposing surfaces, the layer of conductive resilient material extending into and filling them.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 each part-layer is formed on and firmly attached to the one below.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the layer (81 to 84) made up of a plurality of parts includes a part-layer or part-strip of strongly resilient but low- or non-conductive material (81a, 82b, 83d, 84a) and also a carrier layer or carrier strip of material with low resilience but high conductivity (81b, 82a, 82c, 83a to c, 84b).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the cross-section of the strip of at least one of the layers has a lip-shaped projection.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 at least one of the layers (86) or strips is made up of a plurality of part-layers or part-strips in such a way as to form a hollow profile.
A process for the manufacture of an arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the electrically-conductive material is applied directly as a layer or strip in paste form to sections (3a) of the rigid carrier element (1) by dispensing under pressure via a hollow needle (6) or a nozzle, and after application is hardened or crosslinked into a corresponding resilient body, with adhesion and whilst maintaining the shape of the cross-section.
A process according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the hollow needle (6) or nozzle is guided by driving means, particularly computer-controlled, along a given path, over the area (3a) of the part (1), on which the moulding (8) is to be produced.
A process according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in that
 in order to manufacture a shielding member with a layer (81 to 89) comprising a plurality of part-layers, the hollow needle (6) or nozzle is repeatedly guided at least over predetermined areas of the section on which the layer or strip, comprising a plurality of parts, is to be arranged, in such a way that a given moulding of a given shape is formed from a plurality of layers, or strips, of the resilient conductive material, a subsequent layer or strip being applied before hardening or crosslinking of the surface of the preceding strip, so that the two layers or strips connect in a material-conforming manner after hardening or crosslinking.
A process according to one of claims 9 to 11, 
characterised in that
 the resilient conductive material is applied at room temperature.
