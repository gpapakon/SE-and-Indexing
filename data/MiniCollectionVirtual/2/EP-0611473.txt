<ABSTRACT>
Optical disc recordings having ideally shaped pits (24) is disclosed to improve the art of optical disc mastering. A disc substrate (10) has a very thin partially reflective layer (16) applied to the surface of the optical disc upon which data will be recorded. The partially reflective layer (16) is created from a substance normally considered opaque, is created to be so extremely thin that it becomes partially optically transparent. The partially reflective layer (16) is then coated with an optically active lamina (18) to enable the recording of data in the form of pits (24). The resulting pit (24) is without a raised berm area surrounding the pit (24), in what is considered to be an ideal shape for a pit (24). An OD master can be created by finally depositing a conductive and reflective lamina over the pitted active lamina (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the recording of data on 
optical discs, and more specifically towards obtaining 
superior laser tracking and improved pit geometry in 
optical recordings created within the art of optical disc 
mastering. Various methods have been employed in recording data on 
optical discs, wherein data is recorded by having a laser 
burn pits into an optical disc. Optical disc (OD) masters 
are articles from which prerecorded mass produced consumer 
OD's are subsequently molded. The master is a first 
article in the OD manufacturing process having data or 
information recorded on a disc or platter that can be read 
by optical means. All subsequent OD manufacturing and 
duplication processes transfer that identical form, format 
and data from the original first article by various means 
including: vacuum deposition; electroforming/plating; or 
injection molding processes. Past techniques for producing masters combined existing 
technologies from various industries. The most prominent 
of these techniques is the photo resist concept of the 
semiconductor industry. The master has formed on it a 
series of pits which serve to optically record information. 
The pits form a spiral line or track starting at the center 
of the disc and continuing to the outer periphery of the 
disc. Conventionally, the pits are approximately 0.6 µm 
(10-6 meters) wide, 0.9 to 3.3 µm long, 0.12 µm deep, and 
are separated from neighbouring tracks, on either side 
thereof, by 1.6 µm center to center.  
 To record using the photoresist technique, a laminate 
of photoresist material is spun upon a very smooth, 
polished circular plate of glass. The glass plate with 
photoresist laminate is then placed in an oven to cure the 
photoresist. The cured, photoresist coated, glass plate is 
next set upon a turntable which is caused to spin. A data 
modulated laser optical system is focused on the glass 
plate, while suspended by a relatively large and complex 
translational mechanism, to cause the focused spot laser to 
move very gradually, at a steady radial rate, outwardly 
from the center of the spinning glass plate while 
concomitantly irradiating the surface of the plate, the 
effect being to produce a spiral track of data in the 
photoresist material. The turntable spins at either a 
constant angular velocity or a constant linear velocity 
(CLV) while any point on the surface of the plate is being 
irradiated by a laser. This process is referred to as 
mastering, wherein data is recorded by creating pits in the 
optical
