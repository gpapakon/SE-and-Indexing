<ABSTRACT>
A public telephone system includes public
telephone sets assigned with different specific numbers

and allowing speech communication using cards and a
center apparatus connected to the public telephone sets

through a telephone line. The center apparatus includes
a list number forming unit for forming one list number

from numbers of a plurality of invalid cards produced by
illegally rewriting the cards, a registering unit for

registering each formed list number in association with
a series number, management number, and telephone number

of each of the telephone sets, a storage unit for
storing the list number and the series number,

management number, and telephone number of each
telephone set, all of which are registered by the

registering unit, and a list number transmitting unit
for calling, through the telephone line, each public

telephone set corresponding to the telephone number
registered in the storage unit and transmitting a list

number corresponding to each telephone set. Each public
telephone set includes a controller for controlling on

the basis of the list number whether speech
communication is allowed in use of a card.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a public 
telephone system comprising a center apparatus and a 
public telephone set (to be referred to as a telephone 
set hereinafter) for allowing speech communication using 
a card, wherein speech communication is inhibited when 
an invalid card which is illegally rewritten is used in 
the telephone set. In a telephone set for allowing speech 
communication using a card such as a telephone card, to 
prevent speech communication using a so-called invalid 
card which is illegally rewritten, the following 
management for invalid cards has been performed. That 
is, it is uneconomical to store all invalid card numbers 
in a memory of each telephone set because the memory 
capacity of each telephone set becomes very large. For 
this reason, a memory is arranged in a center apparatus 
for managing all the telephone sets, and the numbers of 
invalid cards supposed to be illegally used in each 
telephone set are registered in the memory in 
correspondence with each telephone set and managed. A 
corresponding invalid card number is transmitted to each  
 
telephone set through a telephone line and stored in the 
memory of each telephone set. When a card is inserted in a telephone set to 
make a call, the telephone set reads the card number of 
this inserted card to collate with the invalid card 
numbers registered in the memory. If the number of the 
inserted card coincides with one of the registered 
invalid card numbers, transmission is inhibited. In the conventional invalid card management, 
since the center apparatus manages all the invalid card 
numbers of the telephone sets on the center apparatus 
side, the memory capacity of the center apparatus 
becomes very large, resulting in an economical 
disadvantage. Memory retrieval in registering and 
reading invalid card numbers in the center apparatus is 
undesirably time-consuming because the memory capacity 
is very large. In registering invalid card numbers in each 
telephone set, the invalid card numbers are sequentially 
transmitted from the center apparatus to each telephone 
set. At the same time, to confirm the invalid card 
numbers registered in each telephone set, this telephone 
set is called to allow the center apparatus to receive 
the invalid card numbers therefrom. For this reason, in 
the center apparatus and the telephone set, a data 
transmission time in transmission of the invalid card 
numbers is undesirably prolonged, and the telephone set  
 
cannot be used for the speech communication as its 
primary
