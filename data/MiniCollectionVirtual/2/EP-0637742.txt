<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus and a method 
for measuring concentrations of components with light 

scattering, which allows measurement of concentrations of 
components in a measuring object to be accomplished in non-destructive 

fashion by using light in near-infrared 
wavelength ranges with good transmissivity and relatively 

low light quantum energy. The apparatus is composed of a 
light irradiator (1) for irradiating excited light in a 

near-infrared wavelength range to a measuring object (16), 
a photodetector (2) for receiving and spectrally separating 

Raman scattered light derived from the measuring object 
(16), and an arithmetic unit (3) for calculating 

concentration of a component in the measuring object (16) 
from intensity of the Raman scattered light and outputting 

a calculation result.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
a method for measuring concentrations of components with
light scattering, in which the concentrations of the
components in an object are measured in non-destructive
fashion by making use of Raman scattered light.Conventionally, there has been known an apparatus
for measuring concentrations of components in citrus fruits
in non-destructive fashion by making use of Raman scattered
light (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 4-254744
(1992)).This apparatus is so arranged that laser of a
wavelength in visible radiation range (e.g. wavelength:
514.5 nm) is irradiated to a citrus fruit and, taste of the
citrus fruit is determined, based on the intensity of Raman
scattered light generated due to carotenoid contained in
the pericarp of the citrus fruit. Further, the saccharic
acid ratio of the citrus fruit is estimated from the
content of carotenoid contained in the pericarp of the
citrus fruit so as to judge the taste. In the above conventional apparatus, laser of a
wavelength in visible radiation range is used to calculate
the content of carotenoid contained in the pericarp of a
citrus fruit, which is the measuring object. The laser of
a wavelength in visible radiation range is low in
transmissivity when it is applied to the measuring object,
and large in attenuation factor due to absorption and
scattering in the measuring object. Therefore, it could be
considered that, in the above apparatus, the content of
carotenoid contained in the fruit is estimated by measuring
the quantity of Raman scattered light derived not from the
fruit itself but from its pericarp, i.e. its surface layer,
so as to judge the taste of the citrus fruit.Further, laser of a wavelength in visible
radiation range has large quantum energy, as compared with
laser in near-infrared wavelength range.As a result, when the measuring object is a
living body such as in clinical medicine tests, such a
problem arises that use of the laser in a wavelength in
visible radiation range that will reach a measurement site
within the living body would result in destruction of
structures in the living body.Further, when the laser of a wavelength in
visible radiation range is irradiated to measure
concentrations of components in the measuring object, such 
further problems arise that Raman spectroscopy on the
living body by laser excitation in the visible radiation
range would involve generation of fluorescence from the
living body as well as more frequent occurrence of
photolysis, i.e. photochemical
