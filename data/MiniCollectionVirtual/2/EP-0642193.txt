<ABSTRACT>
The connector includes at least one insulation-displacement contact member (17) which itself includes two arms (50A, 50B) substantially in the same plane and delimiting a slit (52) between them. It is characterised in that it furthermore includes shaped means (73, 74A, 74B) making sure that the electrical conductor (15) is applied against the two arms (50A, 50B) of the contact member, on a first side for one of these arms (50A) and on the opposite side to the previous one for the other arm (50B).

said slot, the two facing flanks (32A, 32B) holding the conductor 
against said contact during placing of the latter in said connection

position.
Connector according to claim 4 characterized in that it
includes an entry channel (36) and a hole (35) in said body (11)

opening into each groove (33) along said line (L1) for receiving and
locating said conductor between said flats (25) for said position of

engagement of said contact in said groove.
Connector according to claim 5 characterized in that said
contact (17) is rotatable in said groove (33).
Connector according to claim 6 characterized in that said
contact (17) includes a lateral hinge (24) transverse to the

direction of said slot.
Connector according to claim 7 characterized in that said
contact (17) and another identical contact constitute a double

contact sharing said hinge (24).
Connector according to claim 7 or claim 8 characterized in that
said contact (17) projects from said body (11) in said engagement

position to enable it to be placed in said connection position by
direct action on it.
Connector according to claim 1 characterized in that said
contact is fixed in said groove (73, 83, 103) and in that said groove

is open lengthways and delimited between two facing flanks (74A, 74B;
84A, 84B; 104A, 104B) which are substantially S-shape, at least

locally and in a longitudinal direction of the groove, and each
adapted to hold a first side of a first arm against a first of said

flanks in a first end portion of said groove and the opposite or
second side of the second arm against the second flank in the second

end portion of said groove and to guide the conductor received in the
longitudinal direction of the groove against the second side of the

first arm and the first side of the second arm, before its engagement
in said slot. 
Connector according to claim 10 characterized in that said
flanks (74A, 74B) are substantially S-shape over the length of said

groove (73) which is also S-shape and each has two substantially
parallel opposite end portions joined by a slantwise middle portion

between the two end portions.
Connector according to claim 10 characterized in that said
flanks (84A, 84B) are substantially S-shape over one end portion of

the groove for one flank and over the other end portion of the groove
for the other flank.
Connector according to claim 12 characterized in that said
groove (83) delimited between said flanks (84A, 84B) is slanted in
