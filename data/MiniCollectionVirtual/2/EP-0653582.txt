<ABSTRACT>
A modular valve system comprises a plurality of interchangeable valve modules which can be combined with one another. The valve modules include a pilot valve (1), a flow intensifier (2) and a switching element (3). The pilot valve (1) can be joined directly either to the flow intensifier (2) or to the switching element (3), and the flow intensifier (2) can be joined directly to the pilot valve (1) and to the switching element (3).

(1);
c) the switching element (3) can be triggered by the pilot
valve (1) via the flow intensifier (2); and
d) both the pilot valve (1) and also the flow intensifier (2)
and the switching element (3) can be operated directly as

valves.
A valve combination according to claim 1, characterized in
that the pilot valve (1) can be selectively combined directly

with the flow intensifier (2) or with the switching element (3)
and the flow intensifier (2) can be combined directly both with

the pilot valve (1) and also with the switching element (3).
A valve combination according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the flow intensifier (2) consists of a double-diaphragm

valve, which has the following construction: 

e) disposed in a valve housing (2a) are two sealing seats (13,
14) connected by a duct (50), with their sealing faces pointing

away from one another;
f) associated with the sealing seats (13, 14) are two closing

elements (12, 16) rigidly coupled to one another, of which
respectively the one closes its associated sealing seat, while

the other opens its associated sealing seat;
g) each closing element (12, 16) is disposed in a valve chamber
(54, 58) and is mounted at a diaphragm (56, 60), which divides

this valve chamber into two portions (54a, 54b and 58a, 58b
respectively);
h) in the one valve chamber (54) the valve chamber portion
(54a) faced away from the duct (50) can be impinged by the

media stream to be intensified;
i) both portions (58a, 58b) of the other valve chamber (58) can
be impinged by a media stream to be switched; and
j) the duct (50) has an outlet (10) for the intensified media
stream.
A valve combination according to claim 3, characterized in
that the valve chamber portion (54b), which lies opposite the

valve chamber portion (54a) of the flow intensifier (2) which
can be impinged by the media stream to be intensified, is

connected to a backflow connection (15, 18) of the flow
intensifier.
A valve combination according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the switching element (3)

consists of two double-diaphragm valves (19, 20) disposed in a
common valve housing (3a), which have the following

construction: 

k) disposed in the valve housing (3a) are two sealing seats
(22, 23 and 13', 14' respectively) connected by a duct, with

their sealing faces pointing away from one another;
l) associated with the sealing seats (22, 23 and 13', 14'
respectively) are two closing elements (21, 21a and 12', 16'

respectively) which are rigidly coupled with one another, of
which respectively the one closes its associated sealing seat,

while the other opens its associated sealing seat;
m) each closing element (12', 16' and 21, 21a respectively) is
disposed in a valve chamber and mounted at a diaphragm which

divides this valve chamber into two portions;

wherein:

n) two valve chamber portions (70, 72), faced towards one
another, of the two double-diaphragm valves (19, 20) are

connected to a distribution chamber (11) which lies between
them and is formed in the valve housing (3a) and which can be

impinged by a media stream to be switched;
o) two adjacent valve chamber portions (78, 80), which are each
faced away from the duct, of the two double-diaphragm valves

(19, 20) are connected to one another and also to a control
input (9') and can be impinged by a controlling media stream;
