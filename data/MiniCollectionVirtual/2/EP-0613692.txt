<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides water soluble wound dressing 
materials comprising from 5% to 50% of an alginate ester of 

a C₁-C₆ polyhydric alcohol; from 50% to 95% of a humectant 
consisting of one or more C₁-C₆ monohydric or polyhydric 

alcohols; and from 0% to 30% of water, the percentages being 
calculated by weight based on the weight of the material 

when anhydrous. The preferred alginate ester is propylene 
glycol alginate (PGA). The materials dissolve in water at 

temperatures below 40°C. The materials are normally 
produced in the form of soft, conformable, wound-friendly 

films. The materials may also comprise medicaments or 
antiseptics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water soluble material
suitable for application to the surface of a wound as or in
a wound dressing.The use of biopolymers as the wound contacting layer of
wound dressings is well known in the art. Biopolymers may
be made absorbent, biocompatible and resorbable, thereby
assisting wound healing. In addition, several biopolymers
such as collagen, chitin, chitosan and alginates have been
shown actively to assist wound healing by chemotaxis. Some
biopolymers also exhibit a haemostatic effect.Among the preferred biopolymers for wound healing
applications are the alginates. This is on account of the
abundance of alginates, their well-understood
physicochemical properties and their proven chemotactic
effect on wound healing. The alginates may be applied to
the wound in a water-soluble form, for example by dusting
sodium alginate powder onto the wound. Alternatively, the
alginate may be applied as insoluble calcium alginate, or as
an insoluble and water-swellable mixture of sodium alginate
and calcium alginate. The soluble or insoluble alginate may
be in the form of fibres, a fleece, a gauze or a film. It
may be attached to other elements of a wound dressing such
as an absorbent layer, a semipermeable or impermeable
backing layer, and/or an adhesive-coated layer. Typical
such alginate fleeces and wound dressings incorporating them
are disclosed, for example, in GB-A-1379158, GB-A-906911,
US-A-4793337, WO 90/01954, US-A-4393048, EP-A-0227955, EP-A-0099758,
EP-A-0344913 and EP-A-0459378.For many applications a continuous film of alginate is
desirable as the wound contacting layer. Such a film
presents a uniform contacting surface to the wound and helps
to exclude bacteria from the wound. Continuous films are
also easier to remove without disrupting the wound bed. Alternatively, the film may be perforated or reticulated to
allow passage through the film of heavy flows of exudate
from the wound while remaining easily removable.In order to be useful, the alginate film should preferably
be strong, elastic, highly conformable, inexpensive,
absorbent and sterilizable by gamma irradiation.
Preferably, the alginate film should contain a high
proportion of humectants such as glycerol so as to maintain
a moist wound surface.Hitherto, no alginate-containing film has provided the
optimum combination of properties for use as a wound
dressing. For example, anhydrous films of calcium and/or
sodium alginate have been suggested for this application.
However, the anhydrous films may incorporate
