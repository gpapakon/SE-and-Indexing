aircraft and lies facing the said opening (4). 
Device according to Claim 4,
 
characterized in that the said linkage means (11) 

comprise: 

a piece (32) which forms a cranked articulation 
assembly, to which piece are connected, respectively 

about a first axis (36) and a second axis (37), these 
axes being parallel, the said false floor and the said 

slideway; 
pins (34) capable of preventing the said piece on the  
 

said false floor from rotating about the said first 
axis; 
two elastic connecting rods (33) provided respectively 
on either side of the said slideway; and 
mechanisms (35) for locking the said slideway, these 
mechanisms being fixed to the said false floor (30) 

and interacting with the said elastic connecting rods 
(33), the ends of which are respectively connected to 

the said corresponding mechanisms and to the said 
slideway about pins (38, 39) which are parallel to the 

said first and second axes. 
Device according to Claim 5,
 
characterized in that the said locking mechanisms (35) 

are identical and in that each of them is composed of a 
U-shaped support plate (40), the base (40A) of which is 

fixed to the said false floor and the side walls (40B) of 
which are provided with oblong slots (40C), in which the 

pin of the said connecting rod (33) can slide, and with 
systems (41) having articulated latch arms (42, 43), 

these being able to be controlled by an actuator (44) and 
capable of locking the said pin of the connecting rod in 

position against one or other of the rounded ends (40D, 
40E) of the said slots. 
Device according to either of Claims 5 and 6,
 
characterized in that the locking mechanisms (35) associated 

with the said connecting rods are controlled by one 
and the same actuator (44), a coupling shaft coaxial with 

the said first axis (36) passing through the said false 
floor in order to connect the locking mechanisms (35). 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterized in that the said slideway (10) has a 

U-shaped cross-section, the base (10A) of which is 
intended to interact with the said structure via the 

linkage means (11), and between the side walls (10B) of 
which slideway the said ramp (12) is guided and held in 

place. 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
Claims 1 to 8,
  
 

characterized in that the said bearing members (14) are 
defined by cylinders (14A) provided at the base (12A) of
