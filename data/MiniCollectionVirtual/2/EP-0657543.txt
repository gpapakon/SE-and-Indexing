<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production 
of a highly unsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, 
which is possessed of noteworthy physiological functions such 
as a cholesterol level reducing effect, an anticoagulant 
effect and a carcinostatic effect, as well as its brain 
metabolism-related application to the improvement of memory 
and learning capacities, prevention of senile dementia and 
treatment of Alzheimer disease and its use as an essential 
fatty acid for the growth of juvenile fish. It is known that docosahexaenoic acid shows various 
physiologically active functions as one of fish oil 
components, and, triggered by the finding of a material which 
contains docosahexaenoic acid in high concentration (tuna 
orbit fat) and the development of new highly efficient 
purification techniques in recent years, studies are being 
conducted in earnest at many research institutions on the 
elucidation of the physiologically active functions of 
docosahexaenoic acid. With regard to the purification and 
use of docosahexaenoic acid, a large number of reports have 
been published, such as on an agent for the prevention and  
 
treatment of thrombosis (Japanese Patent Application Kokai 
No. 57-183716), a process for the separation and purification 
of highly unsaturated fatty acids or esters thereof (Japanese 
Patent Application Kokai No. 61-37752), a carcinostatic 
composition containing a highly unsaturated fatty acid 
(Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 63-258816), a process 
for the separation and purification of highly unsaturated 
fatty acid alkyl esters (Japanese Patent Application Kokai 
No. 63-8356), a carcinostatic agent containing 
docosahexaenoyl monoglyceride as an active ingredient 
(Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 1-203322), a brain 
function enhancing agent containing docosahexaenoic acid and 
its esters as active ingredients (Japanese Patent Application 
Kokai No. 1-153629) and a brain function improving 
composition, a learning capacity increasing agent, a memorial 
power increasing agent, a dementia preventing agent, a 
dementia treating agent or a physiologically functional food 
having brain function improving effects (Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai No. 2-49723). With regard to the production process of docosahexaenoic 
acid, on the other hand, its materialization has been delayed 
because of a difficulty in separating docosahexaenoic acid 
from other highly unsaturated fatty acids having similar 
physical properties, such as arachidonic acid, 
eicosapentae
