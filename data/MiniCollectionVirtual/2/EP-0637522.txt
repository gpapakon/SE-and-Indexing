<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to an arrangement of an engine (3) for a motor car, intended to ensure that the engine cannot penetrate the passenger compartment in the event of a frontal impact, even in vehicles with an extremely short body front end. This is achieved by a combination of the following measures:   a. the engine is fitted inclined at an acute angle ( alpha ) to the horizontal so that substantial areas of the engine run behind the front axle (4); b. approximately parallel thereto, a rigid, downward-pointing slide surface (10) for the engine, displaced rearwards in the event of a frontal impact, is formed by an area of the engine compartment rear bulkhead; c. the front and rear engine mountings (8, 9; 13, 14) or bearing points (6, 7) of a sub-frame (5) supporting the engine are designed and dimensioned so that in the event of a frontal impact the engine remains connected to the vehicle by way of the front engine mountings or bearings of a subframe supporting the engine, whilst the rear engine mountings or bearing points of a subframe supporting the engine are destroyed or break away.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement of a drive engine (3) mounted in a motor vehicle in 
which the drive engine (3) is fitted at an acute downwards angle (α) to the 

horizontal in the direction of travel and is connected to the vehicle by 
means of front and rear engine mounts (8, 9; 13, 14), whereby the engine 

mounts are designed or dimensioned in such a way that in the event of a 
front-end impact the drive engine (3) is deflected towards the road surface 

thus destroying the rear engine mount (9; 14), and the drive engine (3) is 
paired with a rearwards and downwards facing section of a bulkhead, 

whereby the drive engine (3) is mounted in such a way that significant 
parts of the drive engine (3) run behind the front axle (4) and the rearwards 

and downwards facing section of the bulkhead is designed as a flat and 
rigid sliding surface (10) for the drive engine (3) which moves backwards 

in the event of a front-end impact and, furthermore, the front engine 
mounts (8; 13) or bearing positions (6) on the auxiliary frame (5) 

supporting the drive engine (3) are designed or dimensioned in such a way 
that in the event of a front-end impact the drive engine (3) remains 

connected to the vehicle by means of the front engine mounts or the 
bearings on the auxiliary frame supporting the drive engine (3) and that the 

ground clearance of the vehicle is selected in such a way that in the event 
of a front-end impact the drive engine (3) can be pushed completely under 

the vehicle.  
 
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the sliding surface (10) is reinforced, e.g. is double-skinned or has a 

sandwich structure. 
An arrangement in accordance with Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the front end side member (1) and the sliding surface (10) are connected 

together by means of an angled plate (primary contact surface 15). 
An arrangement in accordance with one or more of the preceding 
claims,
characterised in that
 
the drive engine (3) is designed as a transversally mounted reciprocating 

engine with in-line flange-mounted transmission. 
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 4,
characterised in that
 
the axes of the cylinders of the in-line reciprocating engine run at a front-open
ing 
angle of approximately 30° to the horizontal.
