<ABSTRACT>
The ventilation apparatus described comprises a deflector unit (2), and downstream thereof, a perforated cover grille (4). The deflector unit (2) comprises a central boss (6) and outer body (8). A plurality of radially arranged deflector vanes (10) are provided between the boss and outer body in order to deflect air flowing through the apparatus. The cover grille (4) is of sheet steel, 1 mm gauge, perforated by identical openings, which are circular, and 5 mm in diameter. The openings take up 50 % of the area of the grille. The grille has a front wall (18), from each edge of which extends a narrow sidewall (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
 VENTILATION APPARATUSThis invention relates to ventilation apparatus. The invention relates in particular to so-called swirl diffusers which have inclined vanes set in a radial array. When air passes through a swirl diffuser it is deflected outwardly in a turbulent manner which aids rapid mixing, in a room.EP-A-128485 describes a swirl diffuser for use as the floor outlet of a ventilation system, the diffuser having an air deflector with inclined vanes, and a grid over the air deflector. The grid is a substantial part having concentric rings, between which air can pass. The rings are connected by ribs, which are inclined so as not to interfere with the air eddy, passing through the circular apertures between the rings of the grid. It is stated in EP-A-128485 that the arrangement of rings and ribs is such as not to interfere with the eddy. The geometry of the grid, in particular the substantial depth of the rings and, consequently, of the circular apertures, is such that it may be expected that an eddy will be maintained within the air, as it flows in a direction generally axial to the diffuser. Thus the swirling air flow will be substantially unidirectional, directed into the central zone of the room. This will be undesirable in many situations, especially in confined spaces with people present. As a result of this directionality, and also because the central region of the grid does not have circular apertures, there does not appear to be the possibility of air from the room being drawn into the diffuser by an induction effect, which could lead to the advantageous pre-mixing of room air and fresh air, within the diffuser. Rather, mixing of the fresh air with room 

 air would only appear to be possible after the fresh air has left the diffuser.In accordance with the present invention there is provided ventilation apparatus for use as a room outlet of an air flow pathway, in order to deflect air from a confined flow condition, along the pathway, to a dispersed condition, in the room, the apparatus comprising a deflector unit having a plurality of spaced deflector vanes arranged in a generally radial configuration about an axis, but inclined to that axis, thereby to discharge with air in directions transverse to that axis, and a cover grille over the deflector unit, the cover grille having openings whose minimum width exceeds their depth. Preferably the minimum width of the openings exceeds their depth by a factor of at least 2, most preferably, at least 4.Preferably, the openings comprise at least 20%

 CLAIMS
1. Ventilation apparatus for use as a room outlet of an air flow pathway, in order to deflect air from a confined flow condition, along the pathway, to a dispersed condition, in the room, the apparatus comprising a deflector unit having a plurality of spaced deflector vanes arranged in a generally radial configuration about an axis, but inclined to that axis, thereby to discharge air in directions transverse to that axis, and a cover grille over the deflector unit, the cover grille having openings whose minimum width exceeds their depth.
2. Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the minimum width of the openings exceeds their depth by a factor of at least 4.
3. Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the openings comprise at least 20% of the area of the grille.
4. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the openings constitute not more than 80% of the area of the grille.
5. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the grille is a plate with perforations.
6. Apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein the thickness of the plate is in the region 0.5 to 2.0 mm.
7. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the minimum width of the openings is in the range 1 mm to 20 mm. 


8. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the openings are circular.
9. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the grille is detachable from the deflector unit.
10. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the grille and/or the deflector unit has means for locating baffle members therebetween, in order to alter the flow conditions.
11. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the grille is of stepped form, having a front wall and narrow side walls which include openings, such that when the grille is located over the deflector unit, the front wall is spaced from the outlet of the deflector unit and air may exit through the grille, via the openings in the side walls.
12. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the apparatus is arranged such that, in use, air exits from the apparatus in peripheral directions, generally transverse to the deflector unit.
13. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the apparatus is arranged such that, in use, room air is drawn into the apparatus, through a central region of the grille, by an induction effect.
14. Air conditioning apparatus comprising a ventilation apparatus according to any of Claims 1 to 13.
15. Apparatus according to Claim 14, wherein the apparatus serves as a room outlet located in a wall or ceiling of a room. 


16. A cover grille for a ventilation apparatus, the cover grille having openings whose minimum width exceeds their depth.
17. A cover grille according to Claim 16, the cover grille having any feature of the cover grille described in any of Claims 1 to 13.
