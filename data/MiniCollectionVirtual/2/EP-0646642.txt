<ABSTRACT>
A carrier for holding a microorganism in soil 
releases, from a constituting material thereof, an 

inducer for production of an enzyme of the 
microorganism for soil remediation. The carrier for 

holding a microorganism may comprise a combination of a 
microorganism holding carrier composed of a hydrophilic 

polymer for holding the microorganism with an inducer-holder 
comp
osed of another polymer for holding inducer 
manifesting a biological action to the microorganism 

adjacent to each other. A method for remediation of 
soil comprises application of the microorganism-holding 

carrier into the soil. A soil-remedying agent 
comprises the microorganism-holding carrier and a 

microorganism held thereon which exhibits enzyme 
activity for decomposition of a polluting substance in 

the soil under action an inducer released by the 
carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrier for 
immobilization of a microorganism for remediation of 
soil. The present invention also relates to a method 
for remediation of soil employing the carrier holding 
the soil-remedying microorganism. The present invention further relates to a 
microorganism-immobilizing carrier for a bioreactor 
system, a biosensor, and an artificial internal organ 
utilizing the biological activity of an immobilized 
microorganism, in particular, to a microorganism-immobilizing 
carrier which is capable of exhibiting 
biological activity and improving survivability of the 
microorganism. In recent years, various noxious and hardly-decomposable 
chemical substances are detected in soils, 
in rivers, in seas, and in the air, and aggravation of 
the pollution with such substances is attracting 
attention. In particular, soil pollution by organic 
chlorine compounds is causing serious problems. 
Establishment of techniques for preventing the spread  
 
of the pollution and for remedying the polluted 
environment is strongly demanded. For example, soil 
pollution has become a matter of concern in gas 
production sites, oil refinery sites, demolished oil 
refinery sites, demolished fuel stockyard sites, 
demolished pulp plant sites, etc. Therefore 
development of soil remediation technique is strongly 
demanded to clean the polluted soils. The pollution of the soil not only prevents 
subsequent use of the land but also liable to cause 
spreading of the polluted area by diffusion of the 
polluting substance into underground water and its 
diffusion with the water. Therefore a soil remediation 
technique is earnestly desired to be developed early. Various soil remediation methods are known and 
have been tried to restore the soil to the original 
state by removing the polluting substance from the 
polluted soil. The methods include physicochemical methods 
such as aspiration of the polluting substance from the 
soil by vacuum extraction. The physicochemical 
methods, however, involve many problems such as high 
cost, low operability, difficulty in treating the 
polluting substance existing at a low concentration. On the other hand, soil remediation utilizing a 
microorganism, namely bioremediation, is promising. 
The bioremediation methods include strengthening of  
 
self-cleaning function of ecosystem by activating a 
native microorganism in the soil to decompose the 
polluting substance into an innoxious substance; and 
include also, as an improved method, intentional 
introductio
