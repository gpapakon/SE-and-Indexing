<ABSTRACT>
A process for improving the impact properties of 
high-strength steels containing grain-refining additions is 

disclosed along with a product made in accordance therewith. 
The process comprises a pretreatment step involving heating 

and hot deformation at a temperature preferably in excess of 
the solution temperature of the least soluble nitride or 

carbonitride species present in the steel (T ≧ ≈ 1200°C) 
followed by accelerated cooling, such as by water quenching, 

oil quenching, or forced-air cooling. Thereafter, the 
material is subjected to a subcritical annealing treatment 

(≈ 700°C), austenitized at low-to-moderate temperatures of 
between about 850°-950°C, and then quenched and tempered.

<DESCRIPTION>
Be it known that I, Michael J. Leap, citizen of the 
United States and residing at 3157 Sheila Street, N.W., 
Massillon, OHIO 44646 have invented new and useful 
improvements in PREVENTION OF PARTICLE EMBRITTLEMENT IN 
GRAIN-REFINED, HIGH-STRENGTH STEELS of which the following is 
a specification. The present invention relates generally to high-strength 
steels and, more particularly, to a method for 
increasing the impact toughness of aluminum-killed steels as 
well as microalloyed steels, with or without aluminum 
additions. Still more particularly, the invention relates to 
a method of processing these classes of high-strength steels 
containing grain-refining additions to prevent particle 
embrittlement therein. The deleterious effects of second-phase particles 
on the toughness of high-strength steels have received a 
great deal of attention in the art over the past 30 years. 
This attention has primarily focused on particle 
embrittlement induced by non-metallic inclusions, aluminum 
nitride precipitates and large alloy carbides retained 
through the processing of the steel. More recently, 
microalloying technology has been employed in the production 
of grain-refined, 0.1% - 0.4% carbon steels that are hardened 
and then tempered at temperatures below the range associated 
with the onset of tempered martensite embrittlement. The 
applicability of this technology has been, however, somewhat 
limited from the standpoint of restricted carbonitride 
solubility at carbon contents above 0.2%. A review of the 
literature suggests that particle embrittlement, which is 
enhanced by limited precipitate solubility, may have a 
significant effect on the development of toughness in this 
class of high-strength steels. The embrittlement may be 
alleviated via austenitization at high temperatures, but the  
 
decreases in precipitate content that alleviate the 
embrittlement also provide a necessary and sufficient 
condition for austenite grain growth, thereby defeating the 
original purpose of the microalloying technology. 
Considering the potential for second-phase particles to 
degrade the toughness of tempered martensitic microstructures, 
very little work has been done in either defining 
the extent of embrittlement induced by microalloy 
carbonitrides or developing heat treatments to minimize the 
effects of particle embrittlement. The present invention addresses the aspect of 
particle embrittlement and defines a thermal/thermomechanical 
process to provide a fine austenite grain size while avoiding 
or
