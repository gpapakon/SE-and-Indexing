<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a builder system suitable for 
use in a cleansing agent, to a process for the manufacture 
thereof, and to a cleansing agent containing such a builder. Cleansing agents and more particularly (main wash) 
detergents contain a number of groups of raw materials. The 
most important among them are the surface-active substances or 
surfactants, which serve to reduce the surface tension of the 
water, and the builders, which serve to neutralize the 
hardness of the water. Often, such cleansing agents further 
contain bleaching agents for removing colored soil components 
through oxidation, and additives such as perfume, optical 
bleaches, corrosion inhibitors and the like. In the past, for reducing the hardness of the washing 
water, use was mainly made of phosphates. Although these 
phosphates exhibit optimum effectiveness in terms of 
detergency, the use thereof is less desirable with regard to 
eutrophication and excessive algal growth. Accordingly, 
alternatives to the use of phosphates have been searched for. 
Known alternative builders are nitrilotriacetate, ethylene 
tetraacetate, citrate and zeolites. Soda has also been used in 
detergents on account of its calcium-binding activity. The 
presence of soda in detergents leads to the formation of 
insoluble calcium carbonate, often designated as calcite. The mains water that is used in the washing process must 
first be softened on account of the negative influence of hard 
water on the cleaning power of the suds system. When a 
detergent goes into solution, the hardness of the suds system 
is reduced by the activity of the builders. This improves the 
detergency. The fact is there appears to be a virtually linear 
relation between the logarithm of the residual hardness and 
the cleaning power. In the times when mainly phosphates were  
 
used, the residual hardness was approximately 0.01o dH. At 
that value the negative influence of the calcium hardness is 
minimal. It appears that with the builders utilized in the current 
situation, the residual hardness in suds systems of modern 
detergents is approximately 3o dH. This has an adverse effect 
on the detergency. Soda could be an attractive alternative as a builder, 
since it is capable of reducing the residual hardness to the 
same level as was formerly achieved by the phosphates and 
other builders which are no longer desired for environmental 
reasons. Soda moreover does not have any disadvantages from an 
environmental point of view. A major drawback of the use of 
soda,
