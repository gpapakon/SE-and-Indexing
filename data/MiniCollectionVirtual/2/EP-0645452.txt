<ABSTRACT>
Human interferon-beta
2A
 and interferon-beta
2B
 are produced in purified 
form by recombinant DNA techniques. Two separate human genes have 

been identified which code for the production of IFN-β
2A
 and IFN-β
2B
, 
respectively. The sequence of IFN-β
2A
 cDNA is established. These 
genes and cDNA have been cloned into mammalian cells with an SV40 

early promoter sequence and such genomic clones are capable of producing 
IFN-β
2A
 and IFN-β
2B
. The antiviral activity of such 
recombinant IFN-β
2A
 and IFN-β
2B
 is demonstrated as well as other 
biological activity identifying them as human interferons. It has been 

shown that IFN-β₂ secretion is induced in human cells by growth-stimulatory 
cytokines. 
IFN-β
2A
 may be used for preparing pharmaceutical 
compositions useful in the fields of inflammation,, 

acute phase response or regulation of cell proliferation. 
Further uses are suggested.

<DESCRIPTION>
Interferon is an important antiviral and antitumor protein produced 
by the human body. Because of its species specificity, clinical use 
of interferon requires human interferon. Based on their neutralization 
by antibodies three types of interferon were defined which 
include interferon-alpha, produced mainly by leucocytes, interferon-beta, 
produced mainly by fibroblasts, and interferon-gamma, produced 
mainly by T-lymphocytes. The major species of interferon produced by human fibroblasts in 
response to ds RNA is the 20 Kd glycoprotein IFN-β₁, encoded by a 
0.9 kb RNA which is transcribed from an intron-less gene on chromosome 
9. However, additional mRNAs which yield IFN activity when microinjected 
into frog oocytes have been observed in human fibroblasts 
induced by poly (rI)(rC) and by a sequential cycloheximide (CHX)-actinomycin 
D treatment. While cloning the IFN-β₁ cDNA, cDNA clones 
of another co-induced 1.3 kb RNA have been isolated which in reticulocyte 
lysates code for a 23-26 Kd polypeptide and in oocytes produce 
human IFN antiviral activity (J. Weissenbach et al. 1980 Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA 77:7152-7156; British patent 2 063 882.)  Since this activity was inhibited by anti-IFN-β₁ antibodies, it was 
designated IFN-β₂. The protein product of IFN-β₂ 
RNA is immunologically distinct from IFN-β₁, although the biological 
activities of the two proteins are cross-neutralized by the same 
antibodies. The IFN-β₂ 1.3 kb RNA clearly originates from another 
gene than IFN-β₁, since IFN-β₂ RNA is formed in mouse-human hybrids 
lacking chromosome 9 (U. Nir (1984) Ph.D. Thesis, Weizmann Institute 
of Science, Rehovot, Israel). In the German patent application P 30 43 981 a process is disclosed 
for the preparation of interferon-β₂ in purified form. Said 
interferon-β₂ is produced by isolating DNA containing the nucleotide 
sequence coding for interferon-β₂ in human cells after cultivating 
those cells which are able to produce interferon-β₂ when exposed to 
an inducer of interferon. mRNA from said induced cells is extracted 
and purified. Afterwards, the mRNA is transcribed into DNA and the 
DNA is cloned in a suitable vector. It could be demonstrated that there is a second gene encoding IFN-β₂, 
which, when isolated and transfected into hamster or mouse cells 
produces human-specific IFN activity after induction by ds RNA and 
cycloheximide. The IFN produced has the properties ascribed to 
IFN-β₂ but does not have identical amino acid sequences, the proteins 
produced by the two genes are
