<ABSTRACT>
The distribution device allows a received satellite signal to be supplied to a number of subscribers (T1...Tn) using distributor elements provided by a series circuit of stripline directional couplers (SR1...SKn). Each of these has an input gate and two output gates respectively coupled to a subscriber socket and to the input gate of the following coupler, the first coupler receiving the satellite signal at its input gate and the second output gate of the last coupler connected to earth via a termination resistance. Pref. the directional couplers each have a coupling factor which increases in dependence on the attenuation, all the couplers pref. being supported by a common circuit board (LP).
