<ABSTRACT>
The present invention aims at providing a powdery raw 
material composition for a permanent magnet superior in the 

magnetic properties and easy in preparation, a magnetically 
anisotropic permanent magnet, and a method for producing the

powdery raw material composition for a permanent magnet 

according to the present invention is one prepared by subjecting 
a mixture composed of 13-18 weight% of a neodymium powder, 4-10 

weight% of a boron powder and the rest of an acicular iron 
powder coated with aluminum phosphate to a temperature above 

600°C in an atmosphere initially of a hydrogen-containing 
reducing gas followed later by an inert gas, and a magneticall
y 
anisotropic permanent magnet is prepared by compression molding 

a mixture obtained from the powdery composition and a binder 
under heating in the presence of a magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powdery raw material 
composition for a permanent magnet superior in magnetic 
properties and easy in preparation, a magnetically anisotropic 
permanent magnet, and a method for producing the permanent 
magnet by use of the composition. Japanese Patent Publication B-61-34242 discloses a 
magnetically anisotropic sintered permanent magnet composed of 
Fe-B-R (R:rare earth element). For the production, an alloy 
containing the above-mentioned components is cast, the cast 
alloy is pulverized to an alloy powder, and the alloy powder is 
molded and sintered. However, the pulverization of cast alloy 
is a costly step. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for 
producing a powdery raw material composition for a Fe-B-R permanent magnet 
superior in magnetic properties and easy in preparation and a method for producing a 
magnetically anisotropic permanent magnet.  
 Fig.1 is a graph showing magnetic properties of a permanent 
magnet according to the invention. According to the present invention, a powdery raw material 
composition for a permanent magnet is prepared by subjecting 
a mixture composed of 13-18 weight% of a neodymium powder, 4-10 
weight% of a boron powder and the rest of an acicular iron 
powder coated with aluminum phosphate to a temperature above 
600°C in an atmosphere initially of a hydrogen-containing 
reducing gas followed later by an inert gas, and a magnetically 
anisotropic permanent magnet is prepared by compression molding 
a mixture obtained from the powdery composition and a binder 
under heating in the presence of a magnetic field. In the present invention, the aluminum phosphate coating on 
an acicular iron powder not only can prevent oxidation of the 
iron powder but also enhance magnetic properties of the produced 
permanent magnet. The ratio of iron powder to aluminum 
phosphate is preferably from 8:1 to 20:1, and the acicular iron 
powder coated with aluminum phosphate is prepared by mixing 
aluminum phosphate with an acicular iron powder immersed in 
toluene, and then evaporating the toluene. The acicular iron 
powder coated with aluminum phosphate is also obtainable by 
reducing under hydrogen atmosphere at 300-500°C an acicular 
goethite (FeOOH) crystal mixed with and covered by aluminum 
phosphate.  
 The powdery raw material composition for a permanent magnet 
is obtained by preparing firstly a powdery mixture composed of 
13-18 wt% of a neodymium powder, 4-10 weight% of a boron powder 
and the rest (83-72 weight%)
