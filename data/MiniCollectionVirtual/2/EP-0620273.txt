<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and plant for the anaerobic fermentation of organic material originating from municipal waste. This plant comprises: a mixer (5), in which the organic material is diluted with a diluant originating from a pipe (6), and two fermenters (9, 10) connected to the mixer (5), the exit (14) of the first fermenter (9) being connected to the second fermenter (10) via a pump (12) and the exit (16) of the second fermenter (10) being connected to the upstream side of the first fermenter (9) via a pump (11), whereas part of the material exiting from the second fermenter (10) passes into a dehydrating means (18) which produces liquor which is recycled, via the pipe (6), to the mixer (5) in order to dilute therein the fresh organic material which enters therein; and a loop (22, 23) for controlling the viscosity as well as a loop (24, 25, 26) for controlling the temperature of the material passing into the fermenters. This process and this plant apply in particular to the fermentation of household (domestic) waste.

Process for aerobic fermentation of organic materials consisting
of diluting these materials, introducing them into at least two fermentors (9, 10)

in parallel and of recycling at least one portion of the fermented materials
coming out the fermentors towards the upstream portion of these fermentors

where the recycled fermented materials are mixed with the diluted materials,
characterised in that at least one portion of the materials coming out of the first

fermentor (9) is injected towards the upstream portion of the second fermentor
(10), whereas at least one portion of the fermented materials coming out of the

second fermentor (10) is injected towards the upstream portion of the first
fermentor (9).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that at least one
portion of the fermented materials coming out of the second fermentor (10) is

also injected to the upstream portion of a third fermentor (28), whereas at least
one portion of the materials coming out of this third fermentor (28) is injected

either to the upstream portion of the first fermentor (9) or to the upstream
portion of the second fermentor (10).
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that one
portion of the fermented materials coming out of at least one of said

fermentors (9, 10, 28) is dehydrated and the juice obtained is recycled towards
a mixer (5) situated upstream of the fermentors so as to carry out dilution of

the materials to be introduced in the fermentors.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the flow of the materials coming out of at least one of the fermentors is

regulated and injected to the upstream portion of another fermentor by at least

one regulator (22) controlling two pumps (13, 15, 11, 12), valves or similar
elements situated respectively upstream and downstream of each fermentor

so as to obtain a given viscosity of the materials passing inside the fermentors.
System for implementing the process according to one of claims
1 to 4 and including a mixer (5) receiving organic waste mixed with a diluting

agent originating from a device (18) for dehydrating a portion of the fermented
material in at least two fermentors (9, 10), characterised by at least one first

pipe (14) connecting the outlet of a first fermentor (9) to the upstream portion
of a second fermentor (10) and by at least a second pipe (16) connecting the 

outlet of the second fermentor (10) to the upstream portion of the first
fermentor (9).
System according to claim 5, characterised in that the
downstream portion of the second fermentor (10) is further connected to the

upstream portion of a third fermentor (28) whose downstream portion is
connected either to the upstream portion of the second fermentor (10) or to the

upstream portion of the first fermentor (9).
System according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that said pipes
are connected to a pump (11, 12, 29) at the upstream portion of each

fermentor.
System according to one of claims 5 to 7, characterised in that
downstream of at least one of the fermentors (9, 10, 28) is provided with a

dehydration device (18) and at least one stopper tank (20) provided on a pipe
(6) connecting the dehydration device (18) to the mixer (5).
System according to one of claims 5 to 8, characterised in that it
includes a viscosity regulator (22) mounted between the upstream (11, 12, 29)

and downstream (13, 15) pumps of one or each fermentor (9, 10, 28).
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that said upstream and/or downstream pumps of each fermentor can

respectively constitute a single upstream and/or downstream pump with which
valves or similar elements are associated.
System according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
by a temperature regulator (24) connected between the outlet of the upstream

pump (11, 12, 29) of at least one of the fermentors and a vapour intake (27) to
the mixer (5).
