<ABSTRACT>
A wrapping apparatus whereby a wrapping medium (30) may be 
applied to an annular article, such as a coil of metal strip (46), so as to 

cover its inner surface as well as all its outer surfaces comprises a rigid 
loop structure that defines an endless T-sectioned track (16,17) and 

extends as a cantilever extending from a free standing columnar 
support (5,6). The columnar support (5,6) includes elevator means for 

raising and lowering the loop structure. The loop structure includes a 
hinged gate portion (9) that may be swung into an open position to 

enable the track (16,17) to be linked with the annular article and then 
reclosed. A self propelled shuttle (15) is able to ride around said track.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the packaging of goods, being an article 
or a bundle of articles, for their protection against corrosion or soiling by 
liquid or particulate contaminants during handling, transporting and 
storage operations. The invention was developed for the protective packaging of coils 
of steel strip and is described primarily with regard to that application 
hereinafter. It will be appreciated however that it is generally applicable 
to wrapping other goods in the nature of relatively large solid items. Such packaging is discarded when the goods are put to use, and 
so it is desirable not only for the package itself to be inexpensive in so 
far as its materials and construction are concerned, but also for it to be 
applicable to and removable from the goods expeditiously and with a 
minimum of labour. Those desiderata are to some extent incompatible 
with the imperative that the package reliably exclude contaminants for 
what may be a lengthy period. One widely adopted proposal to resolve that incompatibility has 
been to wrap or swathe the article or bundle in substantially impervious, 
pliable sheet or strip wrapping medium. An excellent wrapping medium 
for the purpose is so-called stretch wrap plastics film, which is 
chemically inert, proof to most liquids including water, and tends to cling  
 
to anything it contacts including itself. That film is stretched prior to or 
during its application to the article or bundle. It has the property known 
as "memory" which means it seeks to return to the unstretched state. 
As a result it tends to mould itself to the article and form a tight 
wrapping thereon. One class of known apparatus for applying a pliable wrapping 
medium has comprised a turntable or the like on which the article is 
placed and a draw-off spool holder rotatably supporting a spool of the 
wrapping medium. In use, an end of the wrapping medium is taped or 
otherwise secured to the article and the article is rotated to draw 
wrapping medium from the spool holder and wrap itself therein. The 
spool holder includes tension regulating devices to maintain a suitable 
tension in the drawn-off medium and, in the case of stretch wrap film, to 
stretch it as it leaves the spool. The spool-holder (or the turntable) may 
be moved in the axial direction of the spool to cause successive turns of 
the wrapping medium applied to the article to overlap and so provide an 
uninterrupted coverage. As a general rule the article has to be reoriented 
on the turntable at least once during

<CLAIMS>
Wrapping apparatus comprising a loop structure defining an 
endless track (16, 17), a shuttle (15) able to ride around 

said track, dispensing means (28) on said shuttle able to 
hold a coil (29) of a pliable wrapping medium (30) and 

enabling medium to be drawn from the coil, and work piece 
support means (44) able to support an article (46) to be 

wrapped with at least a part of the article surrounded by 
said track; said loop structure including a gate portion 

(9) that may be moved to an open position to create a gap 
in said track (16, 17) and then returned to a closed 

position to eliminate said gap, characterized in that said 
shuttle (15) carries take-up accumulator means able to 

accomodate, and maintain tension in, a variable quantity of 
drawn off medium (30) prior to its application to the 

article (46). 
Wrapping apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said gate 
portion (9) is hinged to the rest (7) of the loop 

structure. 
Wrapping apparatus according to either claim 1 or claim 2, 
further comprising a free standing support structure (5, 6) 

from which said loop structure projects so as to be spaced 
above a floor on which said free standing support structure 

stands. 
Wrapping apparatus according to claim 3, wherein said free 
standing support structure (5, 6) comprises elevator means 

whereby said loop structure may be raised and lowered. 
Wrapping apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein at least one of said loop structure and 

said work piece support means (44) is moveable horizontally 
with respect to the other.  

 
Wrapping apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said work 
piece support means (44) comprise means (47) for 

reorienting a work piece (46) supported thereby. 
Wrapping apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said means 
(47) for reorienting comprise a pair of spaced apart, power 

driven, axially parallel, cylindrical rollers. 
Wrapping apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein said take-up accumulator means comprise a plurality 

of fixedly positioned training rollers (33, 34, 35), a 
plurality of yieldably positioned training rollers (39, 40) 

and loading means (41, 42, 43) resiliently loading the 
yieldably positioned rollers away from the fixedly 

positioned rollers, so as to maintain tension in a variable 
length of wrapping media (30) extending in a tortuous path 

about the respective training rollers. 
Wrapping apparatus according to claim 8, wherein said 
loading means comprise a pressurable gas reservoir (42) 

and, in respect of each of said yieldably positioned 
training rollers, at least two rodless pneumatic cylinders 

(41) comprising external saddles (43) that remain in 
register with a piston within the cylinder and to which 

said each yieldably positioned training roller (39, 40) is 
mounted; one end of each cylinder (41) being vented and the 

other end being pipe connected to said reservoir (42). 
Wrapping apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said track (16, 17) comprises a T-sectioned 

rail and said shuttle comprises two rigidly spaced apart 
side plates (19) on and between which are rotatably mounted 

two pairs of inner track wheels (20) two pairs of outer 
track wheels (21) and two pairs of side track wheels (22)

said rail while permitting it to ride therealong.  

 
Wrapping apparatus according to claim 10, wherein said 
shuttle (15) is self-propelled by an electric motor drive 

(23) connected to a pinion (24) and engaged with a rack 
(48) on, and extending for the full length of, the said 

head flange (17).

wherein said shuttle (15) further comprises prestretch 

means (37, 38) to stretch medium (30) drawn from said coil
