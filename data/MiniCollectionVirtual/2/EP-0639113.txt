<ABSTRACT>
Described is an environmentally sound method for using acid waste water with the simultaneous formation of a sorbant, the method being characterized in that acid waste water arising from clay production and containing, as the main components, Al
<
3+
>
, Fe
<
2+/3+
>
, Ca
<
2+
>
 and Mg
<
2+
>
 cations and inorganic anions is reacted with an alkaline water-glass solution and the precipitate thus formed is separated off from the aqueous phase and optionally purified and dried. The sorbant is of use in the bleaching of oils or in the removal of soaps, phospholipids and heavy metals from oils, particularly edible oils.

A method for the non-polluting utilisation of acid 
waste water to form a sorption agent, characterised in that 

an acid waste water from bleaching earth production, which 
contains Al
3+
, Fe
2+/3+
, Ca
2+
 and Mg
2+
 cations and inorganic 
anions as the main constituents, is reacted with an alkali 

water glass solution, the precipitate obtained is separated 
from the aqueous phase and is, optionally, purified and 

dried. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that an acid waste water is used having a content of 

divalent cations of 0.2 to 25 g/l, preferably of 0.4 to 12 
g/l, and a content of trivalent cations of 0.1 to 80 g/l, 

preferably of 0.2 to 31 g/l. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that a waste water with the following cation content is 

used:

0.1 - 80, prefer. 0.1 - 21, in part. 0.1 - 4.0 g/l 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the Fe
2+
 cations are oxidised to form 
Fe
3+

oxygen. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a sodium water glass solution with a 

weight ratio SiO

the divalent and trivalent cations. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterised in that the precipitation of the divalent and 
trivalent cations is carried out at temperatures of 

approximately 20 to 100°C, preferably at approximately 40 to 
100°C, in particular at approximately 60 to 80°C. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that to effect precipitation the alkali 

water glass solution is added while stirring to the solution 
of divalent and trivalent metals, or vice versa. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the relative proportion between the 

waste water solution and the alkali water glass solution is 
adjusted so that, after precipitation of the precipitate, 

the reaction medium has a pH value of 5 to 7, preferably 6.

characterised in that the separated precipitate is purified 

by washing and is dried at temperatures of less than 300°C,
