<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to friction materials and
more specifically to fibrous fillers in friction materials.Friction materials are used in many forms. As used herein,
the term "friction material" refers to a component of an assembly
which is attached to a moving body.In use, the friction material is pressed against another
member. Either the friction material or other member moves when
the body moves such that pressing the friction material against
the other member generates a frictional force which retards
motion of the body or couples a motive force to the other member.
For example, in a brake assembly attached to a car, a brake pad
presses against a brake disc. The frictional force generated in
the brake assembly retards motion of the car. As another example
in a transmission assembly in a car, a clutch plate coupled to
the wheels of the car is pressed against a clutch plate attached
to the engine. The frictional force between the clutch plates
couples motive force from the engine to the wheels making the car
move.Perhaps the largest and most important use of friction
materials is in brakes. One widespread way of making brake
materials is to first form a mix. In this method, various
fillers are mixed with a thermoset resin and then pressed at an
elevated temperature until the resin cures, holding the fillers
together in a cohesive mass. Various types of mounting means can 
be attached to the brake material, either during the pressing or
after, so it can be mounted to a vehicle.The specific fillers and amounts used in any given brake
material is generally a closely guarded secret of the
manufacturer. However, there are certain characteristics of
brake materials which are generally measured and used for
comparison to other materials.Compressive and flexural strengths of the brake material are
important. During braking, and to a lesser extent just in
handling the materials, various forces are imposed on the brake
materials. The brake material must not prematurely crack or fall
apart in the face of these forces. To test brake materials, the
flexural and compressive strengths of material are measured by
applying forces to test specimens until they break. Since the
brake material heats up during use due to frictional heating,
these mechanical properties are measured both at room temperature
and at the elevated temperature.Also, because the brake material heats up during use, the
coefficient of thermal expansion of the brake material is
measured. If the material expands too much when heated,
