<DESCRIPTION>
Processes for in-situ production of alkali metal hypochlorite, such 
as sodium hypochlorite, by electrolysis of dilute solutions of the 
corresponding chlorides in water, are well-known. These have been 
mainly developed to avoid safety problems associated with the 
transport and handling of liquid chlorine which can be used to produce 
the hypochlorite solution by suitable mixture with aqueous sodium 
hydroxide. Said safety problems are of a particular concern as most 
uses involve small capacity systems which are usually operated by 
people without specific technical competence. As is well-known, sodium 
hypochlorite is a strong oxidizing, bleaching and sterilizing agent. 
It is widely used for waste water treatment, for the sterilization of 
potable water, in swimming pools and in laundromats. Recently solid 
calcium hypochlorite has become available on the market but it does 
not meet the above requirements being difficult to dose and in 
particular is extremely expensive. Today, various types of electrolyzers are available for the on-site 
production of hypochlorite. A most recent system is based on the use 
of membranes, as described for example in US Patent 4,129,493. This 
system involves higher investment and operating costs due to a more 
complex construction and operating procedures which require 
qualified operators. A suitable system must be capable of generating 
dilute hypochlorite solutions, for example containing 0.1-1% of 
active chlorine, at low cost. Suitable electrolyzers are typically 
free of diaphragms or membranes and have a different construction 
depending on the type of operation and can be either batch or  
 
continuous. The 
internal geometry of the known electrolyzer is conditioned by the 
need to overcome the problems affecting prior art designs without 
diaphragms or membranes for the production of dilute hypochlorite 
solutions, such as: 
loss of current efficiency. The sodium hypochlorite loss is 
essentially due to the chemical decay and to the electrochemical 
reduction/oxidation of hypochlorite at the cathode and anode 
respectively. In order to overcome such degradation, the 
electrolyte temperature must be kept between 15 and 40°C and a 
homogeneous current distribution maintained. These objectives are 
attained, according to the prior art teachings, by minimizing the 
interelectrodic gap and the relevant Joule effect and inserting 
into the system, either inside or outside the electrolyzer, 
suitable heat-exchange systems and gas distributors, as described 
in US
