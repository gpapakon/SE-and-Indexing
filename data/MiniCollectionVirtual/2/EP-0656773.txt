<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic or dermatological compositions for treating and/or preventing UVB radiation-induced immunosuppression are characterised by a therapeutically or cosmetically effective content of one or several radical catchers, as well as by the use of one or several cosmetically or dermatologically acceptable radical catchers for the cosmetic or dermatological treatment and/or prevention of UVBradiation-induced immunosuppression. The radical catchers are chosen from the group of thiols and/or thiol derivatives, that of tocopherols and derivatives thereof, and that consisting of 2,4-0-Furfurylidensorbitol and/or its alkyl ethers.

<CLAIMS>
Use of one or more cosmetically or dermatologically 
acceptable free radical scavengers for the preparation 

of cosmetic or dermatological preparations for the 
treatment and/or prophylaxis of the immunosuppression 

induced by UVB radiation. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the free radical scavenger(s) is(are) selected from the 

thiols and/or thiol derivatives group, from the 
tocopherols group and their derivatives, from the group 

consisting of 2,4-O-furfurylidenesorbitol and/or its 
alkyl ethers, from the group of carotenes, from the group 

of vitamin A and its derivatives, in particular retinyl 
palmitate, and also thiodipropionic acid. 
Use according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the thiol(s) or thiol derivative(s) is(are) selected from 

the compound group which is described by the generic 
formula 


 
the radical X being selected from the group -O-R' and 

-NRR' and the R, R' and R'' radicals independently of one 
another being: H, C
1-18
-alkyl or -alkenyl, or C
1-18
-acyl. 
Use according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the organic radicals are selected such that the radical 

X is selected from the group -O-R' and -NRR', and in that 
R, R' and R'' independently of one another represent: H, 

ethyl or acetyl.
