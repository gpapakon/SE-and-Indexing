<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are devices and methods for the clinical analysis of a sperm sample. The devices comprise a solid substrate, typically on the order of a few millimeters thick and approximately 0.2 to 2.0 centimeters square, microfabricated to define a sample inlet port (16A) and a mesoscale flow channel (20, 40) extending from the inlet port (16A). In one embodiment, a sperm sample is applied to the inlet port (16A), and the competitive migration of the sperm sample through the mesoscale flow channel (20, 40) is detected to serve as an indicator of sperm motility. In another embodiment, the substrate of the device is microfabricated with a sperm inlet port (16A), an egg nesting chamber (16B), and an elongate mesoscale flow channel (20, 40) communicating between the egg nesting chamber (16B) and the inlet port (16A). In this embodiment, a sperm sample is applied to the inlet port, and the sperm in the sample is permitted to competitively migrate from the inlet port (16A) through the channel (20, 40) to the egg nesting chamber (16B), where in vitro fertilization occurs. The devices of the invention may be used in a wide range of applications in the analysis of a sperm sample, including the analysis of sperm morphology or motility, to assess sperm binding properties, and for in vitro fertilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods and 
apparatus for conducting analyses. More particularly, 
the invention relates to the design and construction of 
small, typically single-use, modules capable of rapidly 
analyzing microvolumes of a fluid sample. In recent decades the art has developed a very 
large number of protocols, test kits, and cartridges 
for conducting analyses on biological samples for 
various diagnostic and monitoring purposes. 
Immunoassays, agglutination assays, and analyses based 
on polymerase chain reaction, various ligand-receptor 
interactions, and differential migration of species in 
a complex sample all have been used to determine the 
presence or concentration of various biological 
compounds or contaminants, or the presence of 
particular cell types. Recently, small, disposable devices have been 
developed for handling biological samples and for 
conducting certain clinical tests. Shoji et al. 
reported the use of a miniature blood gas analyzer 
fabricated on a silicon wafer. Shoji et al., Sensors 
and Actuators,15:101-107 (1988). Sato et al. reported 
a cell fusion technique using micromechanical silicon 
devices. Sato et al., Sensors and Actuators, A21-A23:948-953 
(1990). Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp. 
(USA) has manufactured a microprocessor-controlled 
laser photometer for detecting blood clotting.  
 Micromachining technology originated in the 
microelectronics industry. Angell et al., Scientific 
American,248:44-55 (1983). Micromachining technology 
has enabled the manufacture of microengineered devices 
having structural elements with minimal dimensions 
ranging from tens of microns (the dimensions of 
biological cells) to nanometers (the dimensions of some 
biological macromolecules). This scale is referred to 
herein as "mesoscale". Host experiments involving 
mesoscale structures have involved studies of 
micromechanics, i.e., mechanical motion and flow 
properties. The potential capability of mesoscale 
structures has not been exploited fully in the life 
sciences. Brunette (Exper.Cell Res., 167:203-217 (1986) and 
164:11-26 (1986)) studied the behavior of fibroblasts 
and epithelial cells in grooves in silicon, titanium-coated 
polymers and the like. McCartney et al. (Cancer 
Res., 41:3046-3051 (1981)) examined the behavior of 
tumor cells in grooved plastic substrates. LaCelle 
(Blood cells, 12:179-189 (1986)) studied leukocyte and 
erythrocyte flow in microcapillaries to gain insight 
into microcirculation. Hung and Weissman reported a 
study of fluid
