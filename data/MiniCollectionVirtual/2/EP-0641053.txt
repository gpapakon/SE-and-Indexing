<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for control of lasing 
wavelength in distributed feedback lasers using an improved 

waveguide. The waveguide comprises a periodic structure or 
grating and an active stripe which is oriented at a nonzero 

angle Θ with respect to a line perpendicular to the lines 
of the grating. Incremental changes in the operating 

wavelength of a plurality of lasers can be achieved by 
forming the active stripe of each waveguide of each laser 

at a different angle Θ. This method and apparatus provides 
a fine degree of control over the operating wavelength of 

distributed feedback lasers and is particularly useful in 
high capacity optical communications networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method 
and apparatus for varying the lasing wavelength of 
distributed feedback lasers. This invention is 
particularly useful for high capacity wavelength-division-multiplexing 
in optical fiber amplifying transmission 
systems. Information transfer over an optical fiber 
transmission system can be increased by multiplexing 
several signals on a single fiber. In wavelength-division-multiplexing 
("WDM"), a plurality of optical sources are 
used to transmit a plurality of optical signals on a single 
optical fiber. Each source operates at a different 
wavelength. In high capacity WDM systems, the lasers must operate 
at precisely determined wavelengths with fine wavelength 
separations from one laser to the next of about 0.8 to 1.6 
nanometers (nm). Such precise wavelength control can be 
achieved by using a distributed feedback (DFB) laser. DFB lasers employ a periodic structure, typically a 
corrugated slab or grating known as a distributed Bragg 
diffraction grating to achieve single frequency operation. 
The grating is designed so that light of a particular 
wavelength will be reflected constructively. This is known 
as Bragg reflection. Lasing occurs at this particular 
wavelength, the Bragg wavelength, with diffraction losses 
preventing other modes from lasing. It is understood that 
as used herein, "distributed feedback" or "DFB" lasers 
refer to distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, as well.  One way to alter the operating wavelength of a DFB 
laser is to change the period of the grating. The period 
is given by
 
Λ = mλ₀/2Neff , where Λ is the period of the grating; m is 
the integer order of the grating; λ₀ is the Bragg 
wavelength (the lasing wavelength); and Neff is the 
effective refractive index of the propagating mode in the 
active stripe. A 0.8 nm wavelength separation in 1.55-µm DFB lasers 
corresponds to a grating pitch difference of 0.13 nm. Such 
fine control over grating pitch manufacture has been 
demonstrated by holographic and contact printing 
techniques. In the holographic technique, resists are 
exposed using two interfering UV laser beams, and then 
etched. See, for example, Pakulski et al., "Fused silica 
masks for printing uniform and phase adjusted gratings for 
distributed-feedback lasers," Appl. Phys. Lett. 62(3), 222-24;

Distributed Feedback Lasers," Fourth Int'l Conf. Integrated
