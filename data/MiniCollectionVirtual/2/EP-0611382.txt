<ABSTRACT>
The method of producing plasticised polyvinyl alcohol by mixing polyvinyl alcohol in the presence of an organic plasticiser and water in a quantity which is insufficient to dissolve the polyvinyl alcohol under normal conditions, includes the steps of: i) pre-plasticising the polyvinyl alcohol at a maximum temperature no higher than its softening point so as to produce a pre-plasticised polyvinyl alcohol having a melting point below the softening point of the polyvinyl alcohol used, and ii) further processing the pre-plasticised polyvinyl alcohol thus produced at a temperature above its melting point, under shear-stress conditions and for a period of time such as to produce a substantially homogeneous melt.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF PRODUCING PLASTICISED POLYVINYL ALCOHOL, AND ITS USE.The present invention relates to a method of producing plasticised polyvinyl alcohol and to its use in processes for the preparation of thermoplastic polymeric compositions which include starch and polyvinyl alcohol and are suitable for the production of films and moulded or extruded articles having good biodegradability characteristics.The production of films based on starch and polyvinyl alcohol by casting and simple extrusion processes is known.In this connection, US patent 3,316,190 is directed towards the production of non-cling, water-soluble films by the casting of an aqueous solution containing polyvinyl alcohol, starch and a surfactant.US patent 3,472,804 describes the production of films which are insoluble in water by the casting of compositions including polyvinyl alcohol of high or medium molecular weight, starch or, preferably, dextrin, polymerisable derivatives of formaldehyde, more precisely, urea-formaldehyde or phenol-melamine reaction products, and a plasticiser.US patent 3,949,145 describes the production of biodegradable films useful as mulching by 'the casting of aqueous solutions of polyvinyl alcohol, starch and glycerine. The water-resistance of these films is improved by a water-resistant polymeric coating. 

 US patent 3,312,641 describes the use of polyvinyl alcohol as a plasticiser for amylose or starches with amylose contents of more than 50%. The compositions are converted into films by casting or by simple extrusion with the use of an extruder with a filming orifice.It will be appreciated that the production techniques described above are expensive and not very suitable for large-scale industrial production.Film-forming, biodegradable polymeric compositions including starch and thermoplastic polymers which are insoluble, or relatively insoluble, in water, possibly in combination with hydrophilic polymers which are soluble in water, have recently been described. These compositions enable films and moulded articles with improved mechanical characteristics to be produced by processes which are conventional in relation to thermoplastic materials. In this connection, EP-A-0 400 532 describes compositions including starch and an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer which may include up to 15% by weight of polyvinyl alcohol with reference to the total weight of the composition, and a plasticiser. These compositions are prepared by blending the components in the presence of a limited water content and/or of a plasticiser
