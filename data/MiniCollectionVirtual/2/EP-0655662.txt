<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing
apparatus for developing an electrostatic latent image
on an image bearing member usable with an image
forming apparatus such as an electrophotographic
apparatus, electrostatic recording apparatus or the
like, as defined in the preamble of claim 1.It is conventional that a beam is introduced
into a developer container for containing a developer,
and the light transmitted through the container is
detected to detect the presence or absence of the
developer therein.Referring first to Figures 21 and 22, there
is shown an example of such an apparatus. Figure 21
shows a light transmitting type, wherein reference
numerals 115 and 116 designate a light emitting
element and light receiving element, respectively. A
developer container 125 is provided with a transparent
window 126a and a transparent window 126b for
transmitting the light at the position corresponding
to light emitting element 115 and light receiving
element 116.When a sufficient amount of the developer is
in the developer container 125, the light from the 
light emitting element 115 having entered the
developer container 125 through transparent window
126a, is blocked by the developer therein, so that the
light will not reach the light receiving element 116.
When the developer container becomes empty by the
consumption of the developer, the light from the light
emitting element 115 reaches the light receiving
element 116 through the transparent window 126a and
transparent window 126b. In this manner, the presence
or absence of the developer is detected on the basis
of the change of the output of the light receiving
element 116.Figure 22 is an enlarged view of a cleaning
member 129 for cleaning the windows. It is rotatable
about shaft 129a by an unshown driving source. A
cleaning blade 128 of flexible material is mounted to
a tip end of the cleaning member 129 and is brought
into contact with the inside surfaces of the
transparent window 126a and transparent window 126b
and wipes the developer T thereon out, with rotation
of the cleaning member 129. By doing so, it is
avoided that the erroneous discrimination of presence
of the developer due to the contamination of the
windows, despite the absence of the developer.Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 14, no. 124 (P-1018);
& JP-A-1 319 065 discloses such a developing
apparatus comprising a wiping sheet fixed to a
rotatable cleaning member.As one of factors influential to the cleaning
of the windows, there is a contact angle  between the
cleaning blade 128
