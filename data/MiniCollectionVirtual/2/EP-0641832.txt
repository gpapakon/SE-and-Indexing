<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
diorganopolysiloxane compositions and cured products
therefrom, wherein aromatic polyimide polymer or
polybenzobisoxazole polymer is an essential component.
The invention further relates to methods for the
preparation of the compositions.Fiber-reinforced composites are one example
of the conversion of polymer materials into composites
with the goal of application as structural materials
that must exhibit high stiffness and high strength.
Molecular composites have been proposed for the
purpose of realizing the concept of macroscopic fiber-reinforced
composites on the molecular level (see, for
example, Motowo Takayanagi, Kobunshi, volume 33, page
615 (1984), and Rikio Yokota, Kino Zairyo (Function and
Materials), October issue, page 22 (1988)). Molecular
composites consist of polymer with a rigid linear main
chain that is molecularly dispersed in a flexible
polymer matrix. Since the rigid linear polymer has a
very large aspect ratio in the absence of aggregation,
a reinforcing activity close to that of a fiber-reinforced
composite can theoretically be obtained.
Moreover, high-performance materials can be expected
because, unlike fibers, there are also no defects at
the level of the individual molecules.Generally, however, the molecular dispersion
of rigid linear polymers in flexible polymers is
problematic. The various attempts at solving this
problem have consisted of, for example,
(i) the synthesis of a block copolymer of poly(p-phenylene
terephthalamide) (= rigid linear
polymer) and nylon 6 (= flexible polymer) followed
by dispersion of this block copolymer in nylon 6 
(Motowo Takayanagi et al, J. Macromol. Sci.-Phys.,
volume B17, page 591 (1980)),(ii) metalation of poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide)
(Motowo Takayanagi et al., J. Appl. Polym. Sci.,
volume 29, page 2547 (1984)),(iii) polymerization of acrylamide by metalation-generated
poly(p-phenylene-terephthalamide) anion
with the simultaneous production of a nylon 3
matrix and nylon 3-grafted poly(p-phenylene
terephthalamide) (D. R. Moore et al., J. Appl.
Polym. Sci., volume 32, page 6299 (1986)),(iv) blending the polyamic acid precursors of an
wholly-aromatic rigid linear polyimide and a
polyimide that contains flexible groups in its
main chain and then thermally imidizing this blend
(Itaru Mita, Kemikaru Enjiniyaringu [Chemical
Engineering], August issue, page 69 (1990)),(v) conducting polymerization to give rigid linear
polymer in a solution of matrix polymer (Kohei
Sanui et al., J. Polym. Sci.: Part A:
