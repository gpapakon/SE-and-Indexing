<ABSTRACT>
The lighting fixture (luminaire) has a luminaire housing (10) which is mounted on a supporting device (21). The supporting device (21) consists of parallel hollow profiled rods (22) through which the supply lines (supply cables) run. At the top sides of the profiled rods (22), slots are arranged into which plug parts of the luminaire housing engage. In the luminaire housing, there are furthermore provided cable passage openings (20a) which coincide with the slots of the profiled rods.
