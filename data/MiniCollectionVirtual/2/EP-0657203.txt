<ABSTRACT>
Removal of NOx and SOx from flue gas 
utilizing a transport line adsorber (102) through which 

sorbent is transported by pressurized flue gas to cause 
the sorbent to adsorb NOx and SOx 

from the flue gas while the flue gas is transporting the sorbent 
through the transport line adsorber. A plurality of 

interconnected cyclones (120) is utilized to contact sorbent saturated 
with NOx and SOx removed from the flue gas 

with a heated gas to heat the sorbent and remove the NOx 
from the sorbent and separate the sorbent and the heated 

gas to produce an off stream of heated gas carrying the 
removed NOx away; the heated gas and gravity combine 

to pass the sorbent through the plurality of cyclones 
and which cyclones are positioned vertically and 

successively downwardly with respect to each other. A plurality 
of interconnected cyclones (150) is al
so utilized to contact heated 
sorbent having the NOx and SOx removed 

therefrom with a cooling gas to cool the sorbent and separate 
the sorbent from the cooling gas to produce cooled regenerated 

sorbent for recycling and repeating of the NOx and 
SOx flue gas removal. 
Also a sorbent particle stream splitter (174) is mounted 
upstream of the first plurality of interconnected cyclones 

(120) to return a portion of the sorbent particles having 
said oxides adsorbed thereon to the bottom input portion 

of the transport line adsorber (102).
