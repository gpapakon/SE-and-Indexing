<ABSTRACT>
A wave transmission line (10, 16) offering 
protection for electronic devices connected to the line 

from the effects of a high voltage impulse of relatively 
low frequency which includes a wave propagating line 

connected to at least one of the devices. The line is 
characterized in that it includes at least one segment 

which is a waveguide (16) dimensioned to allow free 
passage of waves of relatively high frequencies during 

normal operation while substantially preventing the 
propagation of the relatively low frequency waves of the 

impulse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means for
protecting electrical components from the damaging
effects of lightning and, more particularly, to means
for protecting a receiver or transmitter front end,
which may be an amplifier, a pre-amplifier, mixer,
detector, filter, limiter, T/R switch and the like,
connected to an antenna, from being damaged when
lightning strikes the antenna.Typical antenna systems, such as those used in the
transmission and reception of microwave signals,
include an antenna dish mounted in a prominent
position, usually on a mast and/or on top of a
building, where it can achieve line-of-sight contact
with other antennas. The antenna is connected by a
transmission line, typically a coaxial line or cable,
to a front end located in the vicinity of the antenna,
and from there to the rest of the components of the
system.The placement of the antenna in a prominent
location, where it is often among the tallest
structures in the vicinity, makes it highly vulnerable
to attack to a lightning strike. When lightning
strikes the antenna dish, the coaxial line directs the
high voltage impulse to the front end and, typically,
destroys it, rendering the system inoperable and
necessitating the replacement of the damage component.Various attempts have been made to protect the
front end from lightning strikes. One such technique
is described in "Protecting VHF antennas from EMP", S.
Sebastian, I.E.E.E., 1991, CH-3044-5, and involves use
of an appropriately rated spark gap between the inner
and outer conductors. During normal operation, the two
conductors are isolated from each other by the
dielectric. However, when a sufficiently large voltage 
is encountered, a short circuit is created in the spark
gap which prevents the impulse from reaching the front
end. A disadvantage of the spark gap technique is that
it is limited by capacitance considerations to use at
relatively low frequencies.GB-A-736,365 teaches a high frequency coupling
arrangement comprising a non-metallic dielectric
waveconductor (i.e. a non-metallic waveguide) and means
for feeding and taking high frequency energy from the
non-metallic dielectric waveconductor, which prevents
passage of low frequency coupling arrangement.JP-A-01 278 101 teaches a wave propagating line
including a metallic waveguide line and, like GB-A-736,365,
an insulating waveguide implemented therein.
JP-A-01 278 101 further teaches grounding of the wave
propagating line on the antenna's side to create a low
resistivity path to ground.Despite these disclosures,
