There is disclosed a compound shown by a formula of 

   wherein R₁ is a hydrogen atom, alkyl group having 1 - 4 
carbon atoms or acyl group having 1 - 4 carbon atoms; R₂ and 

R₃ are a hydrogen atom, alkyl group having 1 - 4 carbon 
atoms, phenyl radical, halogen atom, cyano radical, acyl 

group having 1 - 4 carbon atoms, nitro radical, alkoxy group 
having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, or substituted or non-substituted 

amino group, respectively; 
n
 is an integer of 1 
- 3; and dotted line means a possible ring,

 
and a salt thereof. The compound and salt bind with muscarinic 

receptor in brain to develop a powerful actuation thereof and 
thus those can be used as an effective ingredient for preventing 

and curing senile dementias, and more particularly Alzheimer's 
disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, salts 
thereof and use thereof as an effective ingredient for preventing 
and curing dementias and more particularly, a senile dementia. In recent years, medical techniques have great advanced to 
prolong the average span of human life and as a result, senile 
dementias tend to increase. As typical senile dementias, there 
are a cerebral vascular dementia due to a cerebral infarction, 
hemorrhage or the like and an Alzheimer type dementia, cause of 
which has been estimated as an atrophy or falling off of 
cerebral nerve cells. Symptoms of such senile dementias mainly 
appear as a retention defect, orientation defect or thinking 
disturbance, and emotional disturbance and abnormal behavior may 
be observed as concerned symptoms. The Alzheimer type dementia tends to increase, as number of 
aged peoples of 65 years old or more increases in total population 
and thus it becomes one of social problems requiring urgent 
countermeasures including an inquiry of cause, establishment of 
positive remedy, various matters in a family caring for the 
patient. According to pathological and biochemical studies, this 
type dementia has possibly caused by a falling off of cerebral 
nerve cells, cerebral atrophy, defect on acetylcholine and other 
nervous conducting substances or accumulation of amyloid-β - 
protein in brain. Among them, the study on acetylcholine disturbance 
is most advanced, but real state is under study and an excellent 
curing agent and therapeutics have not been found. In recent years, THA (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine) 
was developed in USA, as an agent for curing the Alzheimer type 
dementia, to give a topic with great interests. However, recent 
news report that an effectiveness and a certain side effect of 
THA were called in question. Therefore, it was anxious to develop such an agent for  
 
preventing and curing dementias that its pharmacological effects 
ensurely appear and has low toxicity. Starting from the development of said THA, developments on 
anti-dementia agents have been proceeded in various countries in 
the world and main current thereof lies in developing an agent 
for activating acetylcholinic nervous conducting substances. 
There are 3 strategies for activating acetylcholinic nervous 
conducting functions. Namely, the first measure is an exhibition of acetylcholine 
esterase to increase a concentration of acetylcholine decreased 
in brain, second is an acceleration of acetylcholine discharge 
in synapse, and third is a
