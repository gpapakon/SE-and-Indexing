<ABSTRACT>
This actuator is characterised in that it includes a cylinder (1) associated with a pyrotechnic triggering module (2) and in which there is mounted an actuating push button (4) associated with means for moving the latter within the cylinder, between a retracted position and an active actuating position when the pyrotechnic module (2) is triggered, the push button being held in the retracted position inside the cylinder by an end portion (1b) of the cylinder, this end portion being connected to the rest of the cylinder by breakage zones (8) which can be broken under the effect of shockwaves created by the pyrotechnic module (2) when it is triggered.

Actuator triggered by pyrotechnic means, comprising 
a cylinder (1) associated with a pyrotechnically 

triggered module (2) and wherein an actuating push 
member (4) is mounted which is movable between a 

retracted position and an active operational position 
when the pyrotechnic module (2) is triggered, 

characterised in that the push member is held in the 
retracted position in the cylinder by an end portion 

(1b) of the latter, in that the push member (4) is 
associated with means for displacing it between its 

retracted position and its active operational position, 
and in that said end portion (1b) of the cylinder is 

connected to the remainder thereof by frangible zones 
(8) which can be broken away under the effect of shock 

waves produced by the pyrotechnic module (2) as it is 
triggered, the module serving only to produce the shock 

waves and not to move the push member. 
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for displacing the push member in the 

cylinder are formed by pressurised gas contained in at 
least one chamber (6) of said cylinder. 
Actuator according to claim 2, characterised in 
that pressurised gas is contained in two chambers (6, 7) 

defined by the push member (4) in the cylinder, one (7) 
of which is connected to atmosphere when the end portion 

(1b) is separated from the remainder of the cylinder 
following the triggering of the pyrotechnic module. 
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for displacing the push member in the 

cylinder comprise a resilient member (10) arranged in 
one chamber of the cylinder. 
Actuator according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the resilient member consists of a helical spring  

 
(10). 
Actuator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises means (11, 

12) for blocking the movement of the push member (4) 
towards its retracted position after the pyrotechnic 

module has been triggered. 
Actuator according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the blocking means comprise a deformable elastic 

ring (11) arranged round the push member (4), the facing 
surfaces of this ring and the push member having 

complementary inclined planes for expansion of the 
elastic ring (11) against the inner wall of the cylinder 

(1) in order to prevent any displacement of this push 
member towards its retracted position. 
Actuator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises means (4a, 

4b) for immobilisation in the retracted position of the 
push member. 
Actuator according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the immobilising means comprise push rods (4a, 4b) 

extending on either side of the push member, one (4a) of 
which abuts on the end portion (1b) for holding the push 

member in the retracted position in the cylinder.
