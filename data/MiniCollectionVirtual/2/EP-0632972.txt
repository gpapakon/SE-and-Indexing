<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to a foot-covering innersole or protective 
stocking manufactured on circular stocking knitters and consisting of two parts 

(11, 12) in the manner of pocket-type heels, which face each other and are 
joined as one piece by a middle zone (13), and of an elastic border (14), which 

is made and knitted in with the said two parts (11, 12) directly and as one 
piece on the circular machine which operates with reciprocating motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the manufacture of knitted articles in 
the form of foot-covering innersoles or protective stockings on circular 
stocking knitters. The knitted articles, in the form of foot-covering innersoles or protective 
stockings, are presently manufactured on circular stocking knitters and are  
 
then taken up again to attach a standard elastic to them, by means of stitching, 
on the border of each of them. DE-C-931 000 is a document describing such a 
prior art method. The elastic, which is inserted by stitching, in 
addition to having a negative effect on the production cost, also poses 
problems of adapting to the foot, that is, problems of wearability of the 
manufactured article in that the elastic can be irritating. The object of the present invention is to provide a knitted article of the 
above type in which the elastic is manufactured directly on the circular 
machines by being processed in the knit of the manufactured article, which 
prevents the use of an elastic separately attached to the innersole, 
any stitching operation and the costs pertaining thereto. Another object of the present invention is to provide a knitted article in the 
form of a foot-covering innersole or protective stocking with improved features 
of adaptability and wearability in that the elastic border produced on the circular 
machine, although it is made in one piece with the knit, is soft and thin and 
does not create irritations when wearing the manufactured article. These objects are achieved with a manufactured article in the form of a 
foot-covering innersole or protective stocking in accordance with claim 1 and 
thus complete with an elastic border manufactured directly on a circular machine 
which operates with reciprocating motion. The present invention will be better explained in the description below  
 
with reference to the attached drawing, in which the only figure shows a 
finished foot-covering innersole or protective stocking. The foot-covering innersole or protective stocking being examined consists 
of two parts 11, 12 in the manner of pocket-type heels, which face each other 
and are joined in one piece by a middle zone 13 of the manufactured article, 
and it is provided with an elastic border 14. The article being examined is manufactured on circular stocking knitters, 
having a needle-holder cylinder which is also capable of reciprocating rotaly 
motion, and provided, in the known manner, with stitch-drop stations for 
rotations both in one direction and in the other

<CLAIMS>
Foot-covering innersole or protective stocking manufactured on 
circular stocking knitters, comprising two parts (11, 12) in the manner 

of pocket-type heels, which face each other and are joined as one piece by a 
middle zone (13) and an elastic border (14) characterised in that the 

elastic border (14) is made and knitted to 
the said two parts (11, 12) directly and as one piece. 
A method of creating a foot-covering innersole or protective stocking in accordance with 
claim 1, characterised by making an initial part (15) out of elastic, with reciprocating 

motion and with a part of the needles on the cylinder of a circular knitter, so as to form a first 
semi-annular part of the elastic border (14), followed by knitting with reciprocating 

motion a first heel-type pocket (11) continuously with the said first part (15) of the 
elastic border (14), then continuing the knitting with reciprocating motion 

to form the middle part (13) and the second heel-type pocket (12), which 
faces the first heel-type pocket (11), and by finally making, with reciprocating 

motion, a second elastic part (15'), whose ends are joined by knitting, 
to the ends (16) of the first elastic part (15) to form, directly on the machine, a 

complete elastic border (14) which is made as one piece with the knit of the manufactured 
article.
