<ABSTRACT>
A method of the invention is intented for determination of inductance by means of an electric circuit (1) subjected to the action of a control system (2). In order to determine inductance (L), a measuring system (3) is used to measure one or more parameters, such as the intensity (I), voltage (U), electromotive force and/or the like of electric current traveling in the electric circuit (1). The control system (2) includes an electric-current chopping control element (2a), such as one or more transistors or the like, whereby a power supply (I, U) operating in electric circuit (1) is used to produce in the inductive section (i) of electric circuit (1) at least two voltages (U1, U2) of substantially different intensities, depending on the chopping phase, i.e. the on-phase and the off-phase of control element (2a). Thus, according to the invention, inductance (L) is determined on the basis of voltages (U1, U2) prevailing in the inductive section (i) of electric circuit (1) and/or on the basis of electric current intensity changes (dI1, dI2) occuring therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for determination of inductanceThe present invention relates to a method for deter¬ mination of inductance by means of an electric circuit or a like subjected to the action of a control system, the inductance being determined by using a measuring system to measure one or more parameters, such as the intensity, voltage, electromotive force and/or the like of electric current running in the electric circuit or a like, the control system comprising at least one electric-current chopping control element, such as one or more transistors or the like, whereby an electric-current supply prevailing in the electric circuit or the like is used to generate in the electric circuit or the like or at least in its inductive section, at least two voltages of substantially dif¬ ferent intensities, depending on the chopping phase, i.e. the on-phase and the off-phase, of the control element.A method of the invention is particularly suitable for operating and/or controlling various actuators, such as motors, valves, clutches, magnetic bearings or the like, the functions thereof being based on the deter- mination of a position of a moving actuator component, such as a valve rod, a motor rotor or a like, on the basis of an induction change occurring in an electric circuit.A method based on the determination or the change of inductance is currently applied e.g. in the control of hydraulic and pneumatic valves. Thus, the valve is provided with a separate winding system, comprising for example a primary winding and two secondary windings. In this case, the position of a valve rod is determined by means of a metallic indicator, which is in contact with the rod and which, upon the rod movement, performs a corresponding movement between 

 the primary and secondary windings included in the winding system. Hence, depending on the indicator position, the mutual signal amplitudes of the secondary windings differ from each other, and on the basis of this, the rod position can be determined e.g. by calculation. In principle, a method of the above type has been exploited e.g. in a so-called LVDT-sensor.On the other hand, for example so-called brushless direct-current motors are currently provided with a so-called Hall sensor for measuring the commutating position of a motor and for controlling the motor. The Hall sensor is a magnetic-fieId sensor, which is mounted on a motor in connection with the rotor. Naturally, in order to achieve a control effect, the rotor is required to have a certain type of, e.g. asymmetric construction
