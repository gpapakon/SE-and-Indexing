<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of identical circuit blocks (PG0-PG15) is supplied with 
address signals (A0-A3,A0N-A3N) and each one generating a respective 

selection signal (P0-P15) which is activated by a particular logic 
configuration of said address signals (A0-A3,A0N-A3N) for the selection 

of a particular row (WL0-WL15) of the matrix; each one of said circuit 
blocks (PG0-PG15) also generates a carry-out signal (C00-C015) which is 

supplied to a carry-in input (CI0-CI15) of a following circuit block 
(PG0-PG15) and is activated when the respective selection signal 

(P0-P15) is activated; a first circuit block (PG0) of said plurality of 
circuit blocks (PG0-PG15) has the respective carry-in input (C10) 

connected to a reference voltage (GND); each of said circuit blocks 
(PG0-PG15) is also supplied with a control signal (E), which is 

activated by a control circuitry (6) of the memory device when, during a 
preprogramming operation preceding an electrical erasure of the memory 

device, a defective row (WL0-WL15) is addressed, to enable the 
activation of the respective selection signal (P0-P15) if the carry-out 

(C00-C014) signal supplying the respective carry-in input (CI1-CI15) is 
activated, so that two adjacent rows (WL0-WL15) can be simultaneously 

selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a double-row address
decoding and selection circuitry for an electrically erasable
and programmable non-volatile memory device with redundancy,
particularly for Flash EEPROM devices.In the manufacture of semiconductor memories defects are
frequently encountered that afflict a limited number of memory
elements in the memory matrix. The reason for the high
probability of defects of this type resides in that in a
semiconductor memory device the greatest part of the chip area
is occupied by the memory matrix; moreover, it is in the memory
matrix, and not in the peripheral circuitry, that the
manufacturing process characteristics are usually pushed to
limits.In order to avoid that the presence of a limited number of
defective memory elements on many millions forces the rejection
of the entire chip, and therefore to increase the manufacturing
process yield, the technique is known of providing for the
manufacture of a certain number of additional memory elements,
commonly called "redundancy memory elements", to be used as a
replacement of those elements that, during testing of the
memory device, prove defective; the selection circuits, with
which the integrated component must necessarily be provided,
and which allow the abovementioned functional replacement of a
defective memory element with a redundancy memory element are
indicated as a whole with the name of "redundancy circuitry",
while the set of redundancy memory elements and circuitry is 
defined for short as "redundancy".The redundancy circuitry comprises programmable
non-volatile memory registers suitable to store those address
configurations corresponding to the defective memory elements;
such registers are programmed once and for all during the
memory device testing, and must retain the information stored
therein even in absence of the power supply.In practical implementations of redundancy, both rows
("word lines") and columns ("bit lines") of redundancy memory
elements are provided in the memory matrix; each redundancy
word line or bit line is associated to a respective
non-volatile memory register, wherein the address of a
defective word line or bit line is stored so that, whenever the
defective word line or bit line is addressed, the corresponding
redundancy word line or bit line is selected.As far as matrix word lines are concerned, it has been
recognized that the most frequent defect consists in
short-circuits between adjacent word lines: this situation is
easily detected during testing because when the
