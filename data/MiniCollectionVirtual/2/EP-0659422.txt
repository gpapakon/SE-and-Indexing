<DESCRIPTION>
There are several conditions in which the 
ovaries do not develop and in consequence puberty does not 
occur. Gonadal dysgensis results in a severe disease state 
known as Turner's Syndrome resulting from the absence of a 
second sex chromosome (X chromosome monosomy). The 
syndrome is associated with the female phenotype, shortness 
of stature, sexual infantilism, and various somatic 
abnormalities. Several typical features are observed in 
these patients including distinct facial features, square 
chest, and short broad neck with webbing. Additional 
anomalies include cubitus valgus, congenital lymphedema of 
the feet and hands, renal abnormalities, high arched 
palate, skeletal anomalies, pigmented nevi, keloid 
formation, abnormal nails, and recurrent otitus media. 
Cardiovascular abnormalities include bicuspid aortic 
valves, partial anomalous venous drainage, and hypoplastic 
left-sided heart syndrome (Miller, M.J., et al.J. Pedriatr., 102: 47-50, (1983), Mazzanti, I. et al.Helv. Paediatr. Acta., 43: 25-31, (1988), Van Egmond, H. etal. Br. Heart J., 60: 69-71, (1988)). Renal abnormalities 
include rotation of the kidney, horseshoe kidney, 
duplication of renal pelvis and ureter, and hydronephrosis 
secondary to ureteropelvic obstruction. Skeletal maturation is normal or slightly 
delayed in childhood but lags in adolescence as a result of 
gonadal steroid deficiency. Typically, fishnet appearance 
caused by localized rarefications occurs. Bone mineral 
content reduction occurs as early as 8 years of age as well 
as later in puberty. Changes of the spine, vertebral 
hypoplasisa, and scoliosis are also common. Abnormalities 
of the carpal, wrist, knee and pelvis are also noted. The 
shortness of stature, including uterine growth retardation, 
is not evident until after the first 3 years of life after 
which growth velocity decelerates appreciabley (Park, E.,  et al. Pediatr. Res. 17: 1-7, (1983), Lyon, A.J. et al.Arch. Dis. Child., 60: 932-935, (1985)). In general, the 
patients suffer from sexual infantilism with genital ducts 
and external genitalia being immature. As a result, 
ovarian development is retarded. Current therapy is directed towards correcting 
stature, somatic anomalies and inducing secondary sexual 
characteristics. Recent data indicated growth hormone is a 
viable therapy for stature improvement (Rosenfeld, R.G., etal.J. Pediatr., 113: 393 (1988)). Patients not treated 
with estrogen often develop a severe form of osteoporosis 
similar to that experienced by females after
