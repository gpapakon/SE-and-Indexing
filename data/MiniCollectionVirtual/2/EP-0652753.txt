<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a new means of combatting severe dentoalveolar infections such as dental gangrene, parodontitis and abscesses which involves the administration of the methylol-transfer agents taurolidine and/or taurultam. In one embodiment the taurolidine and/or taurultam compositions may be administered prophylactically to combat post-operative infection. Certain novel compositions comprising taurolidine and or taurultam are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
TREATMENT OF DENTOALVEOLAR INFECTIONS WITH TAUROLIDINE AND/OR TAURULTAMThe present invention is concerned with the combatting tooth and gum infections, in particular severe dental infections which are located within the alveolar region of the jaw.Oral infections remain a relatively common cause of pain and discomfort to many patients and combatting such infections thus continues to be of clinical importance.It was originally believed that the primary cause of dentoalveolar infection was a simple combination of Gram positive and Gram negative aerobic bacteria. Improvements in microbiological techniques have however now led to the realisation that such conditions are in fact usually caused by a mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacterial population, with Gram negative anaerobes playing an important part in the polymicrobial process.The complex aetiology of oral infections results in the observation of widely variable resistance patterns following administration of conventional oral antibacterial preparations. Such preparations may also not be sufficiently active against some of the pathogenic organisms present. There is thus a need for a wide-spectrum agent to treat such mixed infections. Administration of an agent which is ineffective against some of the bacteria present will result in proliferation of the resistant bacterial species and complete elimination of the infection may not be achieved. Typically, the types of bacteria present in dentoalveolar infections include aerobes such as Streptococcus viridans qr. , Streptococcus qr C. , Corynebacterium spp.. Neisseria spp and Haemophilus influenzae. Anaerobes which are also commonly present include Peptococcus spp. , Bacteroides spp. and Furobacterium spp. 

 Conventional treatments include bactericidal agents such as chlorophenol-camphor-menthol, chlorhexidine and antibiotics such as chlorteracyclin and tetracinolon. However such agents are not without unpleasant side- effects including allergic reactions, toxic tissue reactions causing inflammation and necrosis, tooth or filling discoloration and affecting the senses of taste and smell. Moreover, conventional agents require a relatively prolonged period of treatment to be completely effective.The use of Chlortetracycline and Democlocycline is considered inadvisable because of their instability and increased toxicity. It has been shown in this connection, that formation of the highly nephro-toxic anhydro-4-epitetracyclin-hydrochloride occurs in older Tetracycline preparations.The aminoglycoside antibiotic

2. Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein said severe dental infection is gangrene, parodontitis or dental abscesses.
3. Use as claimed in either of claims 1 and 2, wherein said medicament is in the form of a gel, emulsion, liquid gel or rinse solution.
4. An orally acceptable composition in the form of a liquid gel, rinse solution or emulsion, said composition comprising taurolidine and/or taurultam together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
5. An orally acceptable gauze strip impregnated with an emulsion as claimed in claim 4.
6. A method of combatting severe dental infection or dental infection following dental surgery, said method comprising administering an orally acceptable composition comprising taurolidine and/or taurultam to the affected area of the patient.
7. Use of taurolidine and/or taurultam to combat severe dental infection or dental infection following dental surgery.
