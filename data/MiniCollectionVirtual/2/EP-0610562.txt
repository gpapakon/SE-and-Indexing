<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the measurement of temperature in a magnetic centrifugal pump having an impeller which conveys the medium and whose shaft (9) ends at a can (1) where it bears permanent magnets (10) which are driven by permanent magnets (2) which are located opposite and are connected to the shaft of the drive motor. One conductor (3) of a thermocouple (4) is fastened to the inner or outer surface of the can. The other conductor of the thermocouple is formed by the can, as a result of which the conductor circuit for the thermocouple (4) is also closed.

<CLAIMS>
Magnetic centrifugal pump with an excess temperature and starting safety device and 
with a rotor delivering the medium, whose shaft (9) terminates at a gap can (1), where 

it bears permanent magnets (10) driven by permanet magnets (2) disposed at the other 
side of the gap can (1) and which are connected to the shaft (11) of the driving motor, 

characterized in that attached to the inner or outer surface of the gap can (1) is a 
conductor (3) of a thermocouple (1, 3, 4) whose other conductor, closing the conductor 

circuit, is formed by the gap can (1). 
Magnetic centrifugal pump according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one of 
the connecting places (4) between the conductors (1, 3) lies below the zone of the 

magnets (2, 10). 
Magnetic centrifugal pump according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the connecting 
place (4) between the conductors (1, 3) is a weld or soldering joint or some other 

rigid attachment. 
Magnetic centrifugal pump according to claims 1 and 3, characterized in that at least 
one of the connecting places (4) between the conductors (1, 3) lies immediately adjacent 

the zone of the magnets (2, 10). 
Magnetic centrifugal pump according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the conductor (3) attached to the surface of the gap can (1) is a piece of 

wire.
