<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a separator, for separating contaminates from a base liquid, and essentially includes a roof arrangement by which at least part of the roof arrangement depends into the liquid in the separator. In one embodiment the roof arrangement (14) is of generally inverted conical form, the decontaminated liquid flows from the separator through a flow modifying member (25), which dampens any circulating flows in the liquid, and upwardly out of the separator to a reservoir defined by the inverted conical roof arrangement (14). The arrangement also includes means (30a) for releasing gases from the volumes beneath the roof arrangement (14), thereby to maintain the whole of the roof arrangement (14) in contact with the liquid to assist a reducing circulating flow in the liquid on the upper regions of the separator vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to separators and, more 
particularly, to separators for removing contaminates from 
base liquids. In this specification the term "base liquid" is 
intended to mean the liquid to be cleaned of contaminates, the 
term "light contaminates" is intended to mean a any solid, 
semi-solid, semi-liquid or liquid, having a specific gravity 
less than that of the base liquid and the term "heavy 
contaminates" is intended to mean any solid, semi-solid, semi-liquid 
or liquid, having a specific gravity greater than that 
of the base liquid. Separators for separating contaminates from base 
liquids are well known in the art and generally comprise a 
cylindrical vessel, arranged with its axis substantially 
vertical, closed at the top by a flat roof and closed at its 
lower regions by a conical bottom, arranged such that its  
 
central regions are lower than the edge regions thereof. The 
vessel includes an inlet for the contaminated base liquid, an 
outlet for the heavy contaminates in the lower regions of the 
vessel, and/or an outlet for the light contaminates in the 
upper regions of the vessel, and an outlet in the upper 
regions for the decontaminated base liquid. The separation of the heavy and/or light contaminates 
from the base liquid is effected by inducing circulating flows 
in the vessel, generally by introducing the contaminated base 
liquid tangentially into the vessel, whereby the circulating 
flows generate laminar flows within the base liquid, which 
assist the rise of light contaminates and/or the fall of the 
heavy contaminates through the base liquid under gravity. As stated, separators of the type described above are 
well known in the art and are described in detail in, for 
example, British Patent Publications No. 2205512 and 
No. 2158741. In all the separators of the type described above the 
tangential entry of the contaminated base liquid into the 
charged vessel causes the base liquid entering the vessel to 
flow adjacent the cylindrical wall of the vessel, the "drag" 
effected by the cylindrical side wall induces laminar flows in 
the circulating liquid and the heavier contaminates fall 
readily to the lower regions of the vessel whilst the lighter 
contaminates rise readily through the base liquid. In the 
lower regions of the vessel the frictional forces acting 
between the bottom of the cylinder and the circulating liquids 
induces laminar flows in the base liquid which assists in 
slowing down the circulating flows and, in said lower regions 
the flows are

claims characterised in that said outlet for contaminates 

comprises an outlet (15) for heavy contaminates and said 
outlet (15) is located in the lower regions of the separator 

(11) and comprises a sump (15) with an outlet duct (16) 
extended therefrom.  

 
A separator according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
inclusive characterised in that said outlet for contaminates 

comprises an outlet (18) for light contaminates and said 
outlet (18) is located in the uppermost regions of the 

separator (11).

(25) arranged to prevent circulating flows within said 
cylindrical wall (24). 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the decontaminated liquid flowing 

through the decontamined liquid outlet (14
