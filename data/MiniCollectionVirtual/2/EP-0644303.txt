<ABSTRACT>
A wooden beam (1) having an upper surface has a profile which complements the profile of the lower surface and consists of a central body (2) and of two longitudinal strips (3, 4) bonded onto the vertical external longitudinal surfaces of the central body. The profile of the upper surface has two parallel longitudinal tenons (11, 13) between them forming a longitudinal mortice (12), and two horizontal longitudinal rims (14, 15). The profile of the lower surface has two parallel longitudinal mortices (21, 23) and two longitudinal horizontal flaps (24, 25). The depth of the mortices (21, 23) formed in the lower surface is greater than the height of the tenons (11, 13) of the upper surface.
