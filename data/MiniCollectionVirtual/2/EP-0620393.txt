<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-dome, scored rupture disc (24) presents 
opposing first and second disc faces, and is provided 

with a circular, central region and a flat annular 
flange surrounding the central region. An arcuate line 

of weakness is formed in the disc circumscribing the 
central area except for a portion of the circumference 

of the central area defining a hinge about which the 
central region pivots upon rupture. The central region 

is divided by a diametrical ridge into two side-by-side 
semicircular halves within which the disc is bulged to 

form a plurality of separate concavo-convex bulges in 
the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
pressure relief systems and, more particularly, to a 
rupture disc for use in relieving pressure 
differentials in low-pressure industrial applications 
and the like. It is conventional to employ a rupture disc 
as a safety pressure relief apparatus in industrial 
applications for venting excess pressure differentials 
within pressurized components or equipment in order to 
prevent damage to the equipment. Typically, the construction of a rupture disc 
includes a unitary disc having a circular central dome 
region and an outer annular flange. The dome presents 
a concavo-convex shape corresponding to the shape of 
the relief passage within which the disc is positioned, 
and the disc is oriented with the concave surface of 
the dome in contact with the pressure to be relieved. 
This construction is referred to as a forward-acting 
device. A line of weakness is provided in the disc 
which substantially circumscribes the dome except for 
a small portion of the circumference of the central 
dome region which serves as a hinge when the dome 
region breaks free of the annular flange during 
rupture. The line of weakness typically includes a 
scored line formed in one surface of the disc by any 
known method. Conventional discs may be formed of any of a 
number of different materials, and are operable over a 
broad range of pressures. However, because of the  
 
characteristics of these conventional devices, the 
equipment should only be operated at pressures up to 
80% of the pressure at which the disc is designed to 
burst in order to avoid premature rupture of the disc. 
In addition, these discs are not presently constructed 
to reliably vent low pressures. e.g. in the range of 
70 - 560 kPa (10-80 psi.) for a two inch diameter disc. In contrast to these forward-acting discs, 
assemblies of the reverse-acting type are also known, 
and are typically capable of handling normal operating 
pressures up to 90% of the rated pressure of the disc. 
These assemblies typically include a disc having a 
central dome region of concavo-convex shape, wherein 
the disc is positioned in the relief passage with the 
convex surface in contact with the positive pressure to 
be relieved. In reverse-acting rupture discs, it is 
possible to employ a line of weakness around the dome 
region in order to control both the pressure at which 
rupture occurs and the manner in which the dome region 
tears to allow relief of the pressure. For example, it 
is known to provide lines of weakness

<CLAIMS>
A multiple-domed, scored rupture disc (24) 
comprising an essentially flat, non-apertured disc body 

presenting opposing first and second disc surfaces (48, 
50), and including a circular, central region (52) and a 

flat annular flange (54) surrounding the central region 
(52), the rupture disc (24) characterized by: 


an arcuate line of weakness (56) circumscribing the 
central region (52) except for a portion of the 

circumference of the central region (52) defining 
a hinge (58), 
the central region (52) being divided by a diametrical 
ridge (62) into side-by-side semicircular 

halves within which the disc (24) is bulged to 
form a plurality of separate concavo-convex 

bulges in the body. 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 1, 
wherein the diametrical ridge (62) extends between the 

hinge (58) and a point (64) diametrically opposed to the 
hinge (58) relative to the central region (52). 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 1, 
wherein the line of weakness (56) is formed by a scored 

line including a groove formed in one of the surfaces (48, 
50) of the disc body. 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 3, 
wherein the bulges define concavities in the first surface 

(48) and convexities in the second surface (50), the 
groove (56) being formed in the first surface (48).  

 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 3, 
wherein the bulges define concavities in the first surface 

(48) and convexities in the second surface (50), the 
groove (56) being formed in the second surface (50). 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 3, 
wherein the groove (56) is V-shaped, including side walls 

which are angled relative to one another by an angle of 
about 20Â°. 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 3, 

wherein the groove (56) extends into the body a predetermined 
depth which varies along a length of the groove (56) 

to define a relatively deep groove section opposite the 
hinge (58), the remaining length of the groove (56) being 

relatively shallow. 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 7, 
wherein the deep groove section extends around substantially 

one-quarter of the circumference of the central 
region (52). 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 1, 
wherein the body is formed of a material selected from the 

group consisting of stainless steel, nickel, monel, 
inconel, gold, silver, aluminum, tantalum, titanium, 

copper, and alloys of the foregoing. 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 1, 
wherein the first and second surfaces (48, 50) are bowed 

along a length of the diametrical ridge (62) so that the 
ridge (62) is curved along the length thereof.  

 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 1, 
wherein a single bulge is formed in each semicircular half 

of the central region (52), the bulges covering substantially 
the entire central region (52) apart from the ridge 

(62). 
A rupture disc (24) as recited in claim 1, 
wherein a plurality of bulges are formed in each semicircular 

half of the central region (52), the bulges covering 
substantially the entire central region (52) apart from 

the ridge (62).
