<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibrating gyroscope,
and particularly to a vibrating gyroscope for detecting a
rotational angular velocity by utilizing a bending vibration
of a prism-shaped vibrating body.Fig. 4 is an illustrative view showing an example of a
conventional vibrating gyroscope. A vibrating gyroscope 1
includes a vibrator 2. The vibrator 2 includes a vibrating
body 3 having, for example, a regular triangular prism
shape. Piezoelectric elements 4a, 4b and 4c are formed
respectively on side faces of the vibrating body 3. An
oscillation circuit 5 is connected between the piezoelectric
elements 4a, 4b and the piezoelectric element 4c. The
piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b are used for driving to
generate a bending vibration to the vibrating body 3, and
for detecting to obtain a signal corresponding to a
rotational angular velocity. The piezoelectric element 4c is
used for feedback to the oscillation circuit 5, when the 
vibrating body 3 is driven. The piezoelectric elements 4a
and 4b are connected to a detecting circuit 6. The detecting
circuit 6 includes a differential circuit 7 and a
synchronous detecting circuit 8. An output signal of the
differential circuit 7 is detected synchronously by the
synchronous detecting circuit 8.In the vibrating gyroscope 1, the vibrating body 3
bends and vibrates in a direction perpendicular to the face
of the piezoelectric element 4c by a signal of the
oscillation circuit 5. At this time, input signals to the
differential circuit 7 are the same signal, and an output
signal is not obtained from the differential circuit 7. When
the vibrating body 3 rotates on its axis, a vibrating
direction of the vibrating body 3 changes by a Coriolis
force. Thus, a difference is produced between the output
signals of the piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b, and the
difference of the signals is obtained from the differential
circuit 7. An output signal of the differential circuit 7 is
detected by the synchronous detecting circuit 8. Since an
output signal of the synchronous detecting circuit 8
corresponds to a rotational angular velocity, a rotational
angular velocity supplied to the vibrating gyroscope 1 can
be detected by measuring the output signal of the
synchronous detecting circuit 8.However, in the conventional vibrating gyroscope, a 
load impedance of the piezoelectric element is large. When
frequency characteristics or capacitances of the
piezoelectric elements change due to a variation of
circumferential temperature or the like, it is possible that
a voltage of
