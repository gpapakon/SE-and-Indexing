<ABSTRACT>
A spring member (32) and associated channel member (28) bias a solder billet (22) into engagement with a ground electrode (16) of the surge arrestor. When the solder melts in response to a thermal overload condition the channel member (28) causes molten solder from the billet to flow preferentially along a path establishing a low resistance short circuit between the electrodes. Flow of the solder to desired locations is enhanced by solder flux, which preferably is of rosin type having substantial dielectric properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SURGE ARRESTOR FAIL SAFE THERMAL OVERLOADMECHANISMField of the InventionThis invention relates to surge arrestors for preventing damage to telecommunications and other electronic equipment due to lightning strikes, power line cross-overs and the like. The invention more specifically relates to an improved fail safe thermal overload mechanism for a surge arrestor.Background of the InventionSurge arrestors are well known in the telecommunications and related electronic arts. They commonly consist of a tubular housing having ground and one or two line electrodes spaced along its length. When the arrestor is subjected to a current surge condition over a long period of time, as might occur for instance due to a power line crossing, the heat generated by the arrestor may be sufficient to present a fire hazard. In an effort to prevent the foregoing, it has heretofore been proposed to short circuit the ground and line electrodes when the arrestor is subjected to a thermal overload. A commonly employed means for establishing the short circuit includes a spring that is normally maintained in an inactive position by solder or other meltable material. When a thermal overload condition occurs, the material melts and permits movement of the spring to an active short effecting position. In the aforesaid prior art arrestor the meltable material does not itself 

form the short circuit. However, U.S. Patent 4,851,946 discloses a different type of fail safe thermal overload mechanism in which molten solder material directly forms a short circuit between ground and line electrodes when the arrestor is subjected to a thermal overload.Summary of the InventionThe fail safe thermal overload mechanism of the present invention is similar to that disclosed in the above noted prior patent, in that it employs solder material that melts and directly forms the desired short circuit when the arrestor is subjected to a thermal overload. The fail safe mechanism is of highly reliable in its operation and is relatively inexpensive. In a preferred embodiment the fail safe mechanism includes solder flux upon the outer surface of the housing of the arrestor, a solder billet overlying the arrestor housing, and channel and spring members that overlie the billet and bias it to a location closely adjacent and preferably butting the arrestor body. Solder flux may also be provided upon the inner and/or outer surfaces of the solder billet. A preferred flux is a rosin based one that under normal (i.e., no thermal overload) conditions, cleans and
