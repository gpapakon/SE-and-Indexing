<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to nitrogen oxides of
aza and diaza anthracenediones, and more particularly,
to 6,9-substituents which are (aminoalkyl)amino
substituents. These compounds have been shown to have
antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.Certain 1,4-bis[(aminoalkyl)amino]anthracene-9,10-drones
have been reported which show antitumor activity
in clinical trials. Of particular interest has been
ametantrone, 1,4-bis{[2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethyl]amino]anthracene-9,10-dione
and mitoxantrone, 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-bis([2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethyl]amino]anthracene-9,10-dione.
(Zee-Cheng et al., J. Med. Chem.,
(1978), 21, 291-4; Cheng et al., "Progress in Medicinal
Chemistry", Ellis, G.P. and West, G.B., eds.; Elsevier:
Amsterdam, 1983; pp. 20, 83 and references cited therein).
Mitoxantrone is a broad spectrum oncolytic
agent, whose activity is similar to that of the
anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin. Clinical trials
have demonstrated that mitoxantrone has particularly
promising activity in the treatment of advanced breast
cancer, acute leukemia and lymphoma (Legha, Drugs of
Today, (1984), 20, 629). Although animal studies have
demonstrated a diminished cardiotoxicity in comparison
to doxorubicin, some clinical cardiotoxicity has been
observed also with mitoxantrone, mostly in patients
previously treated with doxorubicin (R. Stuart Harris
et al., Lancet, (1984), 219, and references cited therein). Ametantrone has been reported to be, in animals,
about 10-fold less potent and cardiotoxic than mitoxantrone.
Because a delayed toxicity is observed only with
mitoxantrone after administration of the two drugs by
the i.p. route to non-tumor bearing rats at equieffective
antitumor dosages, it is suggested that the presence
of the 5,8-dihydroxy substitution in mitoxantrone
might be implicated in the delayed deaths (Corbet et
al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., (1981), 6, 161).In addition, both mitoxantrone and ametantrone
have a remarkable myelodepressive toxicity and both
compounds show cross-resistance to cell hystotypes developing
resistance against doxorubicin mediated by
overexpression of glycoprotein P. Such a resistance,
which is named multidrug resistance, involves a number
of antitumor antibiotics, among which amsacrine and podophyllotoxinic
derivatives, and it is one of the main
reasons for therapeutical failures in the treatment of
soled tumors with said antibiotics.Therefore, search is required for novel anthracenedione
antitumor agents, having a higher therapeutical
index than mitoxantrone and being
