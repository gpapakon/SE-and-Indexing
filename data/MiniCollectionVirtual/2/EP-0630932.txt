<ABSTRACT>
Macrocyclic polyimide oligomers are prepared by 
the reaction of at least one diamine with at least one 

tetracarboxylic acid or dianhydride thereof in equimolar 
amounts, under conditions of high dilution of said reagents. 

The macrocyclic oligomers are capable of conversion into 
linear polyimides by heating with a primary amine in the 

presence of a macrocyclic polyimide polymerization 
catalyst, typically an alkaline earth or transition metal or 

salt thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new method for
preparing linear polyimides.Linear polyimides and polyetherimides are well
known commercially available polymers having
advantageous properties including thermooxidative
resistance, good mechanical strength, excellent electrical
properties and good chemical resistance. They are normally
prepared by the reaction of at least one tetracarboxylic acid
derivative, typically a dianhydride, with at least one
diamine.In recent years, various new methods for the
preparation of linear condensation polymers have been
developed which involve macrocyclic intermediates. For
example, U.S. Patent 4,644,053 discloses cyclic
polycarbonate oligomer compositions convertible to linear
polycarbonates of high molecular weight. Corresponding
macrocyclic polyester compositions having similar
capabilities are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents
4,829,144 (polyarylates) and 5,039,783.The employment of macrocyclic polyimide
oligomers in the preparation of linear polyimides has the
potential for being at least as advantageous as similar
methods for preparing polycarbonates and polyesters.
Normally, polyimides are prepared in a two-step method,
the first step being reaction of the diamine with the
tetracarboxylic acid or derivative thereof to form a
polyamic acid and the second step being conversion of the
polyamic acid to a polyimide with elimination of water. Methods of this type are generally limited to the
preparation of relatively thin polyimide films, since it is
necessary to remove volatiles (e.g., water and the solvents
employed) without causing formation of bubbles and voids.
In addition, the polyimides are extremely difficult to
process after formation because of their lack of solubility
in common solvents, high glass transition temperatures and
extremely high melt viscosities, typically in excess of one
million poise at 300°C. Thus, operations such as injection
molding cannot be performed.For these reasons, a method of linear polyimide
formation by in situ ring-opening polymerization of
relatively low viscosity macrocyclic oligomers could be
extremely advantageous. With one exception, however,
macrocyclic polyimide oligomers have not previously been
available.That exception is represented by U.S. Patent
4,980,453. It discloses numerous types of macrocyclic
oligomers, including polyimide oligomers, containing
spiro(bis)indane moieties. Compounds containing such
moieties are disclosed as being uniquely and generically
capable of forming a broad spectrum of macrocyclic
oligomers,
