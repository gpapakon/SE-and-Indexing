<ABSTRACT>
A multi-message display panel comprises at least one movable length of fabric (8a) carrying the messages to be displayed. In order to facilitate changing of the messages, the panel includes at least one display sector (3a,3b,3c,3d,3e) provided with at least one fabric-storage cylinder (5a) on which the fabric (8a) is wound. With each storage cylinder (5a) is associated a return roller (7a) arranged at the upper part of the display sector (3a). Moreover, the fabric (8a) covers the return roller (7a) so as to extend, beyond the latter, vertically under the action of a tension bar (9a), so that the fabric (8a) can take up two positions of use, namely a display position, in which it is deployed in the display sector (3a) and a retracted position, in which it is wound on the storage cylinder (5a).

Multi-message display panel comprising on its front face at 
least one display sector (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e) in which the 

messages to be displayed are printed on a canvas (8a, 8a', 
8a"), characterized in that each display sector (3a, 3b, 

3c, 3d, 3e) comprises several horizontal canvas storage 
cylinders (5a, 5a', 5a") which extend across the width of 

the display sectors (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e) over which the 
respective canvases (8a, 8a', 8a") that carry different 

messages are rolled out, with a horizontal guide roll (7a, 
7a',7a") in front of and associated with each storage 

cylinder (5a, 5a', 5a") at the front of the panel, parallel 
to the storage cylinder and positioned at the top of the 

display sector (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e), and such that each 
canvas (8a, 8a', 8a") extends from its respective storage 

cylinder (5a, 5a', 5a") towards and over the associated 
guide roll (7a, 7a',7a") and then vertically downwards from 

the said guide roll under the action of a heavy tensioning 

bar (9a, 9a', 9a") attached to the lower end of the canvas 
(8a, 8a', 8a"), such that the canvas (8a, 8a', 8a") can 

occupy two working positions, namely a first or display 
position in which it is deployed vertically over the 

display sector (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e), and a second or 
retracted position in which it is rolled away on its 

storage cylinder (5a, 5a', 5a"). 
Display panel according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the heavy tensioning bar (9a, 9a', 9a") of each canvas (8a, 

8a', 8a") comprises means to ensure the vertical guiding of 
its ends. 
Display panel according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
each heavy tensioning bar (9a, 9a', 9a") is pierced at its 

ends by holes (13) designed to accommodate vertical guide 
elements (12) attached solidly to the panel, along which 

they slide.  
 
Display panel according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the vertical guide elements (12) consist of rigid rods. 
Display panel according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the vertical guide elements consist of stretched wires or 

transparent cords. 
Display panel according to Claims 4 or 5, characterized in 
that each end of each heavy tensioning bar (9) comprises a 

V-shaped opening (20) facing outwards and opening into the 
hole (13), the walls of the said opening being slightly 

convex such that a vertical guide element (12) can be 
click-fitted into the hole (13) via the opening 920). 
Display panel according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
each end of each heavy tensioning bar (9) is engaged in a 

vertical section of U-shaped cross-section solidly attached 
to the panel. 
Display panel according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that it comprises electric motors that 

rotate the respective storage cylinders (5a, 5a', 5a"), 
with top and bottom end-of-run detectors (19) that are 

activated by the tensioning bars (9a, 9a', 9a") to control 
means of turning the electric motors on and off.
