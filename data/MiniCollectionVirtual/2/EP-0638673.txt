<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluff suppression-apparatus
which is a working apparatus for a spun yarn.Conventionally, in a pneumatic spinning
machine, a sliver supplied from a can is first drafted
by a drafting apparatus, which is formed from three
or more pairs of draft rollers, and is then passed
through a pneumatic spinning nozzle, in which whirling
air flows by jetting of compressed air are produced,
to temporarily twist and spin the same to produce a
spun yarn which is in a twisted condition as twined
fibers are present- on the surface layer of parallel
core fibers. On the surface of such a spun yarn,
extremities of part of the twined fibers are separated
to form much fluff, which makes the spun yarn a cloudy
yarn, having a significant influence on the quality
of the spun yarn.Thus, a fluff suppression apparatus has been developed and is disclosed in DE-A-42
39 310 comprising a pair of rotary members disposed with axes of rotation thereof
crossed with each other and in contact with each other for nipping and sending out a
yarn and at least one of said pair of rotary members has, at a contacting portion
thereof with a yarn, soft resiliency. This contacting portion is formed by a rubber
covering. Such a fluff suppression apparatus, however, has a problem in that at least
the rotary member having the rubber covering is liable to be locally abraded at a 
location thereof at which a yarn is nipped and besides an operation for maintenance
such as adjustment of the contacting pressure is not easy.It is an object of the present invention to provide, in view of such points of the prior art
a s described above, a fluff suppression apparatus which can produce a spun yarn
substantially free from fluff and is superior in durability and easy to perform
maintenance such as adjustment of the contacting pressure.The invention thus provides a fluff suppression apparatus of the present invention is contructed such that it
comprises a pair of rotary members disposed with axes of rotation thereof crossed with
each other and in contact with each other for nipping and sending out a yarn, and at
least one of the pair of rotary members has, at a contacting portion thereof with the
yarn, soft resiliency and a cavity formed in the the inside thereof The
contact between the two rotary members is face contact and a yarn is nipped with
certainty so that a spun yarn substantially free from fluff can be obtained, and besides,
since adjustment of the contacting pressure is easy, the structure for the driving
transmission can be

<CLAIMS>
A fluff suppression apparatus, comprising a pair of rotary members (11, 12)
disposed with axes of rotation thereof crossed with each other and in contact with each

other for nipping and sending out a yarn (Y), wherein at least one (12) of said pair of
rotary members (11, 12) has, at a contacting portion thereof with the yarn (Y), soft

resiliency, and

wherein the rotary member (12) which has soft resiliency is formed at the surface
thereof from a soft resilient member, and has a cavity in the inside
characterized in that

the rotary member (12) which has soft resiliency is a hollow rubber roller.
A fluff suppression apparatus, comprising a pair of rotary members (11, 12)
disposed with axes of rotation thereof crossed with each other and in contact with each

other for nipping and sending out a yarn (Y), wherein at least one (12) of said pair of
rotary members (11, 12) has, at a contacting portion thereof with the yarn (Y), soft

resiliency, and

wherein the rotary member (12) which has soft resiliency is formed at the surface
thereof from a soft resilient member, and has a cavity in the inside

A fluff suppression apparatus as claimed in
claim 1 or 2, wherein one (12) of said rotary members

(11, 12) is a roller having soft resiliency, and the other
rotary member (11) is a roller made of a metal.
A fluff suppression apparatus as claimed in claim
3, wherein the surface of the roller (11) made of a metal is

processed by processing for increasing the coefficient of
friction thereof.
A fluff suppression apparatus as claimed in one
of claims 1 to 4, wherein said pair of rotary member (11, 12)

are disposed with the axes of rotation thereof crossed
substantially perpendicularly with each other.
A fluff suppression apparatus as claimed in one
of claims 1 to 5, wherein one of said rotary members (11, 12)

is formed in an arch-shape such that a central portion
thereof has a larger diameter than the opposite end portions

(12a, 12b) thereof, and the central portion of the larger
diameter contacts with the other rotary member (11).
