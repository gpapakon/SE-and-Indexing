<ABSTRACT>
A gaseous mixture of steam, phenol and 
bisphenol A, such as is obtained in the manufacture of 

bisphenol A, is treated for recovery of bisphenol A and 
phenol by the steps of: 


(a) introducing the gaseous mixture into a 
first cooling zone maintained at a pressure of 30 Torr or 

less and such a temperature that the steam is prevented 
from condensing while a portion of the phenol is 

condensed, wherein the gas is brought into counter-current 
contact with a first liquid cooling medium to 

condense substantially all of the bisphenol A and part of 
the phenol and thereby obtain a mixed gas containing 

uncondensed steam and uncondensed phenol, the first 
liquid cooling medium being phenol or bisphenol A-containing 

phenol; and
 

   introducing the mixed gas into a second cooling 
zone maintained at a pressure of 30 Torr or less and such 

a temperature that substantially all of the mixed gas is 
condensed, wherein the gas is brought into counter-current 

contact with a second liquid cooling medium to 
condense substantially all of the mixed gas and thereby 

obtain a condensate-containing liquid, the second liquid 
cooling medium being an aqueous solution of phenol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for 
condensing a gaseous mixture of steam, phenol and 
bisphenol A, such as is obtained as a by-product in the 
manufacture of bisphenol A, in order to recover bisphenol 
A and phenol. Our European Patent Application No. 92306380.4 
(Publication No. EP-A-0523931), from which the present 
application is divided, discloses a process of producing 
bisphenol A (2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, hereinafter 
referred to as BPA for brevity), which comprises the 
steps of: 
liquefying a crystalline adduct of bisphenol A 
and phenol to obtain a liquefied adduct containing 
bisphenol A and phenol; feeding said liquefied adduct to an evaporating 
zone and forming said liquefied adduct into a downwardly 
flowing liquid film while maintaining said evaporating 
zone at a temperature of 160-185°C and a pressure of 
15-60 Torr to vaporize and remove phenol from said 
liquefied adduct and thereby obtain a first product 
containing bisphenol A and 1-5% by weight of phenol; introducing said first product into a first 
stripping zone and forming said first product into a 
downwardly flowing liquid film while feeding a stripping 
gas to said first stripping zone, wherein said liquid 
film of said first product is brought into counter-current 
contact with said stripping gas at a temperature 
of 170-185°C and a pressure of not higher than 15 Torr to 
strip phenol and to obtain a second product; introducing said second product into a second 
stripping zone and forming said second product into a 
downwardly flowing liquid film while feeding steam to 
said second stripping zone, wherein said liquid film of 
said second product is brought into counter-current 
contact with said steam at a temperature of 170-185°C and  
 
a pressure of not higher than 15 Torr to strip phenol and 
thereby obtain a bisphenol A product and phenol-entraining 
steam; and feeding said phenol-entraining steam to said 
first stripping zone as said stripping gas. In this process the stripping gas which is 
discharged from the first stripping zone as a by-product 
of the process is composed of steam, phenol and BPA, and 
it would be desirable to be able to recover the BPA and 
phenol from this stripping gas. The present invention 
provides a condensation process whereby such recovery may 
be effected. More generally, the present invention provides 
a process for condensing a gaseous mixture of steam, 
phenol and bisphenol A maintained at a pressure of 
40 x 102 N/m2 (30 Torr) or less, comprising the steps of:
