<ABSTRACT>
A method for automatically thawing food in a microwave oven is disclosed. In a 
conventional thawing device, if it is based on a large amount of the food to be thawed, 

a small amount of the food may be overheated, whereas if it is based an a small amount 
of the food, a large amount of food may be less thawed. Therefore, the present invention 

resolves the problem in a manner that the output state of the sensor is sensed for a 
predetermined stop interval, so that the additional heating time is determined, thereby 

accomplishing an optimum thawing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for thawing a
food in a microwave oven, and more particularly to a food
thawing method capable of effectively thawing a small amount
of food.Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a thawing device
equipped in a microwave oven. As shown in FIG. 1, the thawing
device includes a heating chamber 1 for heating a food 2
disposed therein. A turntable 3 is rotatably disposed in the
heating chamber 1. The turntable 3 supports the food 2
thereon. Thawing device also includes a turntable motor 4 for
rotating the turntable 3 and an exhaust port 5 for exhausting
water vapor and gas generated in the heating chamber 1. A gas
sensor 6 is disposed near the exhaust port 5 so as to sense
water vapor and gas exhausted through the exhaust port 5. The
thawing device further includes a microcomputer 7 for
calculating a thawing time for the food 2 based on an output
signal from the gas sensor 6 and controlling various parts of
the microwave oven, a display unit 8 for displaying the 
thawing time calculated by the microcomputer 7 and other
information such as cooking time, a magnetron 10 for
generating a radio frequency wave, an output control unit 9
for controlling driving of the magnetron 10 under a control of
the microcomputer 7, and a key input unit 11 for selecting a
function desired by a user.Operation of the thawing device having the above-mentioned
construction will now be described.When a user lays the food 2 to be thawed on the turntable
3 disposed in the heating chamber 1 for thawing the food and
manipulates the key input unit 11, the microcomputer 7
determines whether an input key signal generated from the key
input unit 11 corresponds to an automatic thawing key signal.
Where the generated input key signal does not correspond to
the automatic thawing key signal, a function according to the
input key signal is carried out. However, where the current
input key signal corresponds to the automatic thawing key
signal, the microcomputer 7 checks a door condition of the
microwave oven. When the door is at its closed state, the
microcomputer 7 sends a control signal to the output control
unit 9. Under the control of the microcomputer 7, the output
control unit 9 controls the magnetron 10 to oscillate, so that
the magnetron 10 outputs radio frequency waves. That is, the
magnetron 10 is controlled to oscillate for 10 seconds and
then stop for 12 seconds repeatedly, as shown in FIG. 3. Now, the procedure of thawing the food will be described
in terms of heating time. At an initial

an initial heating step of initially heating the food for
a first predetermined time;
an additional heating time calculating step of
temporarily stopping the heating of the food for a second

predetermined time after completion of the initial heating
step, determining whether an additional heating of the food

the output signal from the gas sensor and an experimentally 

determined first constant; and
completing the thawing of the food when the calculated
difference is not more than "0", while multiplying the

calculated difference by an experimentally determined second
constant when the calculated difference is more than "0",

thereby determining the additional heating time.
