A method in motor vehicles for determining speed-independent
frequencies, especially resonance frequencies, of a usag
e signal portion of a
rectangular speed signal (S2) generated by means of a rotational speed sensor

(2) cooperating with a sensor wheel comprising a specific number (48) of
approximately equidistant teeth, 
characterised in that,
 by means of an
electronic control device (1),


the duration or the counter reading of each pulse (i) of the rectangular speed
signal (S2) is measured,
at the instant of the currently measured counter reading (τ
i
) the respective
correction factor (k
i-12
) to the previously measured counter reading (τ
i-12
) is
calculated showing the counter reading of a quarter wheel rotation,
the corrected counter reading (t
i-12
) is determined with the following equation:

t
i-12
 = τ
i-12
 · (1+k
i-12
),
the correction factors (k
i
) are calculated from the linear view of the speed
curve between the tooth value (t
i-24
) corrected with the correction factor
detected in this wheel rotation and the tooth value (t
i
) corrected with the
correction factor calculated from the previous rotation,
a linear course is formed between the set points i and i-24 and the detected
counter reading i-12 is placed just on the linear line to this scanning point

and
the correction factor (k
i-12
) necessary for this is corrected by the following
equation:


k
i-12
 = 
τ
i
·(1+k
i
)·Δt
b
 + τ
i-24
·(1+k
i-24
)·Δt
a
τ
i-12
·(Δt
b
 + Δt
a
)
 - 1
wherein the two time portions Δt
a
 and Δt
b
 are calculated with the following
equation:


A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 after calculating all
the correction factors for each tooth i of the sensor wheel a filtering of the

correction factors follows 
in that
 a weighed average value is formed between the
correction factors of the instantaneous and previous rotation according to the

following equation:

k
i
 = 
a·k
i-48
 + k
i
a + 1
