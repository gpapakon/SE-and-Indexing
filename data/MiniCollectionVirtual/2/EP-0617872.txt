<ABSTRACT>
An audience response system in which each audience member is provided with a reflective device (44) (or other radiation source) which is, for example, green on one side and red on the other side. Light from a spotlight (40) is reflected from the reflectors (44) and imaged by a conventional video camera (24). A computer (14) receives the digitized and processed image, forms a map of the audience, and distinguishes the red from the green reflections. This data is then used by the computer (14) to project an image onto a screen (34) visible to the audience, the image being controlled by the red or green image reflections. The audience thus jointly controls the screen image, for instance for purposes of voting or playing a game. The system also can detect movement (direction and/or velocity) of each radiation source which data is aggregated and thereby manipulates the screen image. Also, the sources each may transmit coded information (such as Morse code or ASCII) to individually identify themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the arts of
computer graphics and electronic image processing, and
more specifically to the field of human-computer interface
techniques for a group (one or more) of people
simultaneously interfacing to one computer, and particularly to
a method and system for collecting data from
a plurality of persons being simultaneously present in a room.Much work has been done in recent years to facilitate
the one-on-one interaction of a human and a computer.
This interaction is bidirectional, human-to-computer and
computer-to-human. The present invention relates to the
human-to-computer direction.Devices commonly available for this purpose include
computer keyboards, mouse, light pen, trackball,
microphone, and, through the MIDI communication channel, a
wide variety of musical instruments. In a situation where
more than one person wishes to communicate to a computer
simultaneously, as in, for example, the case of an
audience controlling the course of a movie story, prior
art has little to offer. The only techniques available
fall into two similar categories: wired seats and radio
transmitters.Wired seats refers to the placement, at several or
all seats in a room, of some kind of electronic signalling 
device consisting variously of buttons, switches, dials,
etc. These devices are connected via wires to a computing
or tabulating device which registers the actions made by
the people occupying the seats. This method is often used
to tabulate votes in legislative bodies, and to record
subject reactions in the testing of television
commercials. It, of course, requires significant advance
preparation of the room, which may not be convenient or
possible in many cases.The laying of wires in the room can be avoided by the
second prior art method, wireless communication.Here, the seats, or the people individually or in
groups, are provided with signalling devices connected to
a radio or infrared transmitter. Some form of
multiplexing is employed to keep all the signals
separated. The wireless method has the advantage that no
wires need to be run, and, in addition, the people may be
free to mill about in the area, not being confined to
their seats. This method has the disadvantage of cost,
transmitters and receivers costing far more than wires,
with the attendant potential losses if transmitters are
handed out to members of an audience. Also there are
practical limits to the number of simultaneously
transmitting devices, especially if low cost and/or low
power are considerations. EP-A-0

A method for collecting data from a plurality of persons
(36-1, 36-2) simultaneously present in a room, comprising

the steps of:

providing each one of the plurality of persons with a radiation
source (44) capable of defining at least two states,

at least one of which is detectable by a detector

scanning at least a part of the room with said detector

are in a detectable state;
determining the states of the detected radiation sources
