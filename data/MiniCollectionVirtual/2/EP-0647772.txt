<ABSTRACT>
The internal combustion engine comprises a cylinder head (1), an elongate cylinder block (2), crankshaft bearings (3) beneath the cylinder block, and an oil sump (8). The cylinder block is extended downwards in the form of two down-hanging lateral skirts (4) which do not come directly into contact with the crankshaft bearings. The crankshaft bearings have bearing caps (3b) which are mechanically joined together by two parallel stiffening bars (6). The oil sump (8) is in the form of a large pan fixed, uncoupled, to two lateral flanges (2c) along the cylinder block above the down-hanging skirts.

An internal combustion engine comprising a cylinder head (1), an elongate 
cylinder block (2), crankshaft bearings (3) below the cylinder block and an oil sump 

(8), characterised in that the cylinder block is extended downwards by two lateral 
hanging skirts (4) which do not come into direct contact with the crankshaft bearings, 

in that the crankshaft bearings have cap pieces (3b) which are connected mechanically 
to one another by two parallel stiffening bars (6) and in that the oil sump (8) is in the 

form of a large tank fixed by suspension on two lateral flanges (2c) along the cylinder 
block above the hanging skirts. 
An engine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the lower free ends of 

the hanging skirts (4) are connected to the bearing cap piece (3b) by means of shock 
absorber members (11). 
An engine as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the shock absorber 
members are formed by non-linear viscous shock absorbers. 
An engine as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the thickness of the oil 
film of the shock absorbers is lower than or equal to 50 times the amplitude of the 

displacements of the free end of the hanging skirts due to vibration. 
An engine as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
hanging skirts comprise inner pockets (4a) containing a granular material (5). 
An engine as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
hanging skirts are formed by a plurality of beams (4b) hanging along the cylinder 

block.  
 
An engine as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the hanging beams (4b) 
have different dimensions and form dynamic absorbers frequency tuned to cover the 

spectrum of the vibrations transferred from the cylinder block to the hanging skirts. 
An engine as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the hanging 
skirts (4) have lateral openings (4c). 
An engine as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
oil sump (8) is made from flexible material. 
An engine as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
oil sump (8) is made from a composite material. 
An engine as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
oil sump (8) is mechanically decoupled from the structure of the block.
