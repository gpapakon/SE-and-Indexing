<ABSTRACT>
An ink ejecting device includes ink channels (104) 
intercommunicating with slits (111B) and air channels (127) 

intercommunicating with another slits (111A). The ink channels (104) 
and the air channels (127) have a narrow shape with a 

rectangular cross-section, and all of the ink channels are 
filled with ink and the air channels are filled with air. 

An LSI chip applies a voltage V to a pattern conducting to 
metal electrodes (8) positioned in air channels located at 

both sides of an ink channel (104) from which the ink is to be 
ejected and connects the other patterns connected to metal 

electrodes in other air channels not adjacent the ejecting 
ink channel and a pattern conducting to the metal 

electrodes of the non-ejecting ink channels to a ground 
line. Therefore, the ink ejecting device of the above 

structure requires no insulation between ink and 
electrodes as the working electrodes do not contact the 

ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink ejecting device.Of non-impact type printing devices which have
recently taken the place of conventional impact type
printing devices and have greatly propagated in the
market, ink-ejecting type printing devices have been known
as being operated on the simplest principle and as being
effectively used to easily perform multi-gradation and
coloration. Of these devices, a drop-on-demand type for
ejecting only ink droplets which are used for printing has
rapidly propagated because of its excellent ejection
efficiency and low running cost.The drop-on-demand types are representatively
known as a Kyser type, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,946.398, or as a thermal ejecting type, as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,723,129. The former, or Kyser type, is
difficult to design in a compact size. The latter, the
thermal ejecting type requires the ink to have a
heat-resistance property because the ink is heated at a
high temperature. Accordingly, these devices have
significant problems.A shear mode type printer, as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,879,568, has been proposed as a new type to
simultaneously solve the above disadvantages.As shown in Figs. 10A and 10B, the shear mode type
of ink ejecting device 600 comprises a bottom wall 601, a
ceiling wall 602 and a shear mode actuator wall 603
therebetween. The actuator wall 603 comprises a lower
wall 607 which is adhesively attached to the bottom wall
601 and polarized in the direction indicated by an arrow
611. An upper wall 605 is adhesively attached to the
ceiling wall 602 and polarized in the direction indicated
by an arrow 609. A pair of actuator walls 603 thus formed
forms an ink channel 613 therebetween. A space 615 which
is narrower than the ink channel 613 is also formed 
between neighboring pairs of actuator walls 603 in an
alternating relationship to the ink channels 613.A nozzle plate 617, having nozzles 618 formed
therein, is fixedly secured to one end of each ink channel
613, and electrodes 619 and 621 are provided as metallized
layers on both side surfaces of each actuator wall 603.
Each of the electrodes 619,621 is covered by an insulating
layer (not shown) to insulate it from the ink. The
electrodes 619,621 which face the space 615 are connected
to a ground 623, and the electrodes 619,621 which are
provided in the ink channel 613 are connected to a silicon
chip 625 which forms an actuator driving circuit.Next, a manufacturing method for the ink ejecting
device 600 as described above will be described. First, a
piezoelectri
