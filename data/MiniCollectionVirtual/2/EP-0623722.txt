<ABSTRACT>
It is disclosed a security device (4,6) for 
lockin, in a manner that can be opened, generic leaves. 

The device comprises a hologram (45) wherein 
informations are recorded and which is formed on a 

portable support (41,61), an opto-electronic reader of 
said hologram for comparing said informations with 

identification informations stored in the reader, and 
means for locking/unlocking the leaf (1) controlled by 

the reader. The leaf (1) locking means are operated 
after the reader has read the hologram (45) and 

compared the informations recorded thereon with the 
identification informations stored in the reader 

itself. Since the parameters used for recording the 
hologram (45) can be many and widely varying ones, the 

informations contained therein are the result of a 
large number of combinations which make them virtually 

impossible to duplicate and decode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a security device according to the preamble of claim 1
for locking, in a manner that can be opened, generic
leaves.Before further proceeding in this
description, it is convenient to specify that the word
optronics as used herein refers to a technical field
jointly involving optics and electronics; in
particular, with the attribute deriving from this word,
which is used especially by persons skilled in the art,
there will be defined those devices, apparatuses,
instruments, etc. whose operation is based on
applications of optics and electronics principles.A known example of such applications is
holography; this application may be considered
basically as a technique of recording on a plate or
another support, and of later reproducting as well,
generally luminous waves of the coherent monochromatic
type (laser beam). This technique enables, for
instance, the characteristic reproduction of objects
with three-dimensional effects.Coming now back to the field of application
of the preferred invention, namely to security devices
for doors and generic leaves, it should be pointed out
that, although many technological innovations have been 
made, the solutions currently available on the market
are not fully satisfactory.For instance, among the latest innovations in
this field are locks operated by anti-duplication keys,
intended especially for safes and armoured cabinets;
such keys usually have conventional shapes and have a
set of permanent magnets are embedded in their bit,
whose induction fields have unknown orientation.Unfortunately, even such keys have been
duplicated by counterbeiters. In fact, by disposing
around the bit a set of orientable magnets, the latter
assume a complementary pattern to that of the embedded
magnets, from which it is possible to infer the
original shape of the key.However, this is only one example out of the
many excerptible ones. On a more general level, from
the security systems for doors and leaves based on the
use of combination locks, to the most sophisticated key
designs with various forms and sizes, no technical
solutions have been provided heretofore which either
can eliminate the risk of confidential informations or
elements diffusion, which are useful for overcoming the
protection afforded by said security systems, or
successfully avoid duplication of the keys. Document EP-A-0257808 discloses a security
arrangement for locking in an openable manner a leaf
which can be use in place of conventional door locks.
This security arrangement comprises an

<CLAIMS>
A security device for locking in an
openable manner a leaf (1), comprising a hologram

(45) containing a plurality of information, a
portable support (41,61) for said hologram (45), an

opto-electronic reader (48) associated to said leaf
(1) and fitted to read and compare said hologram

with identification information stored in the reader
(48), and leaf locking means (43,50,51,70) for

locking in an openable manner the leaf (1) under
control by said reader (48), 
characterised in that
:

said leaf locking means comprise a lock (43)
provided with a bolt (51) and a bolt locking

assembly (50) controlled by said reader (48),
said support for the hologram (45) comprises
a key (41) having a bit (42) associated with the

lock (41) to operate the bolt (51),
the reader (48) is located at said lock (43),
the operation of the bolt (51) by the key (41) being

allowed when the bolt locking assembly (50) is
enabled to operate by the reader (48) once the

hologram (45) has been read by the reader (48) and
it has been recognised that the information recorded

on the hologram (45) matches the identification 
information stored in the reader (48).
A device according to Claim 1, wherein said key
(41) has an end (44), extending along its

longitudinal continuation, wherein said hologram
(45) is supported, said end (44) projecting outwards

through a lock (43) opening (46) when the key (41)
is inserted thereinto to allow reading of the

hologram (45) by the reader (48).
A security device according to Claim 1, wherein
said bolt locking assembly (50) is of megnetomotive

type.
A device according to Claim 1, wherein said leaf
locking means (43,50,51) are of electromagnetic

type.
