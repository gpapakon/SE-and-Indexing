<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns belts carrying, in particular, SMD components in order to feed them to pick-and-place component handlers or similar machines. Such belts have at one side a track with regularly spaced guide holes. The invention calls for a band-like splicing aid with a substrate (10, 20, 30) having at least two parallel tracks (11; 12, 16), one of which (11) has protuberances (15) disposed in the same regular array as the guide holes (5) in the belt while the other track (12) has at least one detachable adhesive strip (13, 17). The substrate (10, 20, 30), with its protuberances (15), is used directly to join two belts together and is subsequently pulled off. When a splicing aid of this kind is used, no other devices are necessary.

<CLAIMS>
Splicing aid for connecting component belts, 
preferably with electronic SMDs, in order to feed the 

components to pick-and-place component handlers, the 
belts having in a lateral track guide holes with grid 

dimensions, characterized by a carrier (10, 20, 30) with 
at least two parallel tracks (11; 12, 16), one track (11) 

of which has knobs (15) with the same grid dimensions as 
the guide holes (5) of the belt (1) and the further track 

(12, 16) has at least one detachable adhesive strip (13, 
17). 
Connecting aid according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the knobs (15) and the adhesive strip 

(13, 17) are located on the same surface side of the 
carrier (10, 20, 30). 
Splicing aid according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that two tracks (12, 16) having adhesive strips (13, 

17) are applied in each case in parallel on the carrier 
(20, 30) for arrangement on both sides of the belt (1) 

and a thinning in the material in the carrier (20, 30) is 
present between the two tracks (12, 16). 
Splicing aid according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that a bending fold (19) is present in the carrier 

(20, 30) between the two tracks (12, 16) with adhesive 
strips (13, 17), it being possible simultaneously to 

apply the second adhesive strip (17) on the underside of 
the belt (1) precisely in terms of position and grid 

dimensions by bending over the carrier (10). 
Connecting aid according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that knobs (15) are present with the  

 
grid dimensioning of the guide holes (5) of the belt (1) 

on both tracks (12, 12') of the carrier (30) which are 
adjacent on the outside to the adhesive strips (17, 18). 
Splicing aid according to Claim 1 or Claim 3, 
characterized in that the outer layer of the adhesive 

strip(s) (13, 17) is covered by a protective film (18) 
which can be pulled off before application according to 

specification. 
Splicing aid according to Claim 1 or Claim 3, 
characterized in that the adhesive strip(s) (13, 17) have 

holes (25) with grid dimensions for engagement of 
component ejectors in pick-and-place component handlers. 
Connecting aid according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the knobs (15) are stamped out of the 

carrier (10, 20, 30). 
Connecting aid according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the carrier (10, 20, 30) comprises a film 

or sturdy paper. 
Connecting aid according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the adhesive strip is an adhesive film 

(13, 17) which is attached in a pull-off fashion with the 
non-adhesive side on the carrier (10, 20, 30). 
Connecting aid according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the adhesive strips (13, 

17) are attached on the carrier (20) by ultrasonic 
welding or the like. 
Connecting aid according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the adhesive strips (13, 

17) are attached on the carrier (10, 20, 30) by means of 
less adhesion than on their upper side. 
Connecting aid according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the carrier (10, 20, 30) 

with adhesive strips (13, 17) and, if appropriate, 
protective film (18) can be provided in a magazine as a 

belt on a roller and can be cut to size as strips as 
required. 
Connecting aid according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the carrier (10, 20, 30)  

 
with adhesive strips (13, 17) and, if appropriate, 

protective film (18) is ready-made to a suitable length.
