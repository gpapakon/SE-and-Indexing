<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic or dermopharmaceutical composition consisting of an emulsion of oil-in-water type, containing a silicone gum which is stable in the absence of a surface-active agent by virtue of the use, in the aqueous phase of the emulsion, of an acrylic copolymer and of at least one vinylic monomer bearing at least one amide, amidine and nitrile function.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic or dermopharmaceutical composition 
composed of an emulsion of oil-in-water type which is 

stable in the absence of surface-active agent, 
characterized in that the oily phase contains at least 

one silicone gum and the aqueous phase contains at least 
one copolymer (C) of acrylic acid and of at least one 

vinyl monomer carrying at least one functional group 
taken from the group formed by amide, amidine and nitrile 

functional groups. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the copolymer (C) is a copolymer of acrylic acid 

and of vinyl monomers carrying amide, amidine and nitrile 
functional groups. 
Composition according to either of Claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the copolymer (C) is at least 

partially neutralized. 
Composition according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the copolymer is neutralized by at least one 

alkanolamine. 
Composition according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the alkanolamine is chosen from the group formed 

by N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine, 
triethanolamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the silicone gum is chosen from the 

group formed by polyalkylsiloxanes having trimethylsilyl 
or trihydrosilyl end groups and the following 

copolymers: poly(dimethylsiloxane/methylvinylsiloxane), 
poly(dimethylsiloxane/diphenylsiloxane), poly(dimethylsiloxane/phenylmethylsiloxane)  

 
and poly(dimethylsiloxane/diphenylsiloxane/methylvinyl-siloxane). 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the gums are present as a mixture 

or in solution in a silicone oil. 
Composition according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the silicone oil is a polydimethylsiloxane oil or 

a polyphenylmethylsiloxane oil. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the silicone gum or the mixture of 

silicone gum and of silicone oil is in solution in a 
solvent. 
Composition according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the solvent is chosen from the group formed by 

isoparaffins, methylene chloride, pentane, dodecane, 
tridecane, tetradecane and their mixtures. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the aqueous phase of the emulsion 

represents from 45 to 90 % by weight with respect to the 
total weight of the composition, the oily phase representing 

the remainder. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the copolymer (C) is present in the 

aqueous phase of the emulsion in a proportion of between 
0.05 and 1 % by weight with respect to the total weight 

of the composition and, preferably, between 0.1 and 0.5 % 
by weight with respect to the total weight of the 

composition. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the oily phase contains, in 

addition to the silicone gum(s) or the mixture of 
silicone gum(s) and of silicone oil, at least one oil 

taken from the group formed by vegetable, animal, mineral 
and synthetic oils. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the aqueous phase contains, in 

addition to the copolymer (C), at least one homo- or 
copolymer of acrylic acid, which may or may not be 

crosslinked, or one of its salts.  
 
Composition according to Claim 14, characterized 
in that the polymer of acrylic acid, other than the 

copolymer (C), is present in the aqueous phase of the 
emulsion in a proportion of between 0.1 and 2 % by weight 

with respect to the total weight of the composition. 
Cosmetic use of a composition according to one of 
Claims 1 to 15 as a cream or milk for caring for the 

skin. 
Use of a composition according to one of Claims 
1 to 15 for constituting a make-up product taken from the 

group formed by foundations, mascaras, blushers, eye 
shadows and eyeliners.
