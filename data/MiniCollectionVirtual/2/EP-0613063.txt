<ABSTRACT>
A toner cartridge having no toner pump, with the toner 
adding roller (11) positioned horizontal to the developer 

roller (3), the toner chamber (9) located predominantly 
below the developer roller, the photoconductive drum (7) 

located 120 degrees from the top of the developer roller, 
and the doctor blade (5) located near the top.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrophotographic imaging 
and, more particularly, relates to a toner cartridge having 
no toner pump and associated structure. A toner pump is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,012,289 
to Aldrich et al. It is a device which meters toner from a 
chamber above a developer station. The developer station 
employs a toner applying roller, which is at a 
predetermined electrical potential higher than that of the 
developer roller. The toner applying roller rotates in a 
bed of toner in contact with the developer roller and 
thereby applies toner onto the surface of the developer 
roller, the toner being charged primarily to the same 
electrical sign as that of both the toner applying roller 
and the developer roller. The developer roller then 
rotates past a doctor blade which is charged to a potential 
higher than the developer roller and rejects much toner 
having the other potential (termed wrong sign toner). 
However, such a system does not operate reliably under the 
pressures of a high column of toner which can reach the 
doctor blade-developer roller nip. Consequently a toner 
pump is employed to prevent the toner head reaching the 
doctor blade-developer roller nip. Elimination of the toner pump would reduce 
manufacturing and material costs and unwanted pressure 
variations during operation caused by the operation of the 
pump, which variations have previously been remedied by a 
vent between both sides of the toner pump and by close 
tolerances. A two phase toner pump has also been developed 
to remedy this effect and is the subject of U.S. Patent No.  
 
5,101,237 to Molloy. Elimination of the toner pump would also reduce 
variations in torques, since the other rollers are 
driven off the same power source as the toner pump. 
Reduction in such fluctuations can reduce jitter or, 
alternatively, reduces costs in powering the system 
adequately to avoid jitter. US-A-5,086,728 to Kinoshita shows a toner applying 
roller horizontally aligned with a developer roller, but 
is not otherwise closely similar to this invention. Thus, it is known from US-A-5,086,728 to provide an 
electrophotographic imaging toner cartridge comprising a 
developer roller, a doctor blade in contact with said 
developer roller near the top of the developer roller, a 
toner applying roller in contact with the developer 
roller and located in substantially the same horizontal 
plane as the developer roller, and a chamber for 
electrophotographic toner positioned on the side of the 
toner applying roller
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrophotographic imaging toner cartridge 
comprising a developer roller (3), a doctor blade (5) in 

contact with said developer roller near the top of said 
developer roller, a toner applying roller (11) in 

contact with said developer roller and located in 
substantially the same horizontal plane as said 

developer roller, and a chamber (9) for 
electrophotographic toner (1) positioned on the side of 

said toner applying roller away from said developer 
roller, characterised in that said chamber (9) for 

electrophotographic toner (1) is positioned 
predominantly below said developer roller (3), said 

chamber (9) extending downwardly below the top of said 
toner applying roller (11) by more than twice the 

diameter of said toner applying roller. 
A toner cartridge as claimed in claim 1, also 
comprising a photoconductive roller (7) in contact with 

said developer roller (3), said photoconductive roller 
being positioned substantially below said developer 

roller. 
A toner cartridge as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the location of contact between said toner applying 

roller (11) and said developer roller (3) is 90 degrees 
from the location of contact of said developer roller 

with said doctor blade (5), said photoconductive roller 
(7) is in nip relationship with said developer roller, 

and the location of said nip relationship is 
substantially 150 degrees from the location of contact 

between said toner applying roller and said developer 
roller on the side of said developer roller opposite the 

location of said toner applying roller.  
 
A toner cartridge as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
3, containing dry toner (1) in an amount to fill said 

chamber (9) and up to no more than about the level of 
contact between said doctor blade (5) and said developer 

roller (3).
