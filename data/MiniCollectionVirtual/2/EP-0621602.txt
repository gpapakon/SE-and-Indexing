<ABSTRACT>
A current sensing read arrangement for a static random access memory in 
which critical nodes in the sensing arrangement are equalised before read-out 

commences, and in which differential outputs are applied to a gating arrangement 
which terminates the read-out as soon as a recognisable output signal is obtained, 

so as to minimise power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to random access memories, 
and in particular to read sensing arrangements for random access 
memories. Static random access memories may comprise arrays of memory 
cells that are each made up of a pair of cross-coupled inverters 
with a pair of input/output access paths that are connected by way 
of respective access transistors to a pair of bit lines. The memory 
cells are arranged in rows and columns, with the memory cells of 
each column sharing access to a respective pair of bit lines. 
Except during read or write operations these bit lines are held at a 
common fixed potential by precharge circuits. During a read operation, the access paths of any one memory 
cell of a column are enabled by raising the potential of a 
respective word line connected to the gate electrodes of the access 
transistors, whereupon the current/voltage conditions on the 
respective bit lines start to diverge in a sense dependent upon the 
data value held in the memory cell, the speed at which they diverge 
being determined by factors such as the drive from the memory cell 
and the capacitance of the bit lines. Since typical memory devices 
incorporate many of these pairs of bit lines the effect on the power 
consumption can be quite marked. Known memory designs using voltage sensing techniques take 
a small bit line differential voltage signal and amplify it over 
several stages to obtain the necessary data signal levels with a  
 
high speed of response, but such techniques have a number of 
disadvantages, such as the power consumption and the delay involved 
in effecting the required voltage changes. There are designs which use current sensing techniques, 
such as those discussed by Seevink et al. in IEEE Journal of Solid 
State Circuits, Vol. 26, No. 4, April 1991, pp 525-535, which have 
the advantage of offering lower power consumption since high 
capacitance modes such as bit lines and data bus lines do not have 
to change in voltage. However, these known current sensing 
arrangements do not provide for effective equalisation of critical 
nodes to allow a fast response when the current sensing amplifiers 
are turned on, so that a period of time is generally needed to allow 
for settling before correct sensing can take place. According to one aspect of the present invention in a 
semiconductor integrated circuit static random access memory 
comprising a plurality of memory cells arranged in rows and columns, 
the memory cells each having differential access paths which in 
respect of the
