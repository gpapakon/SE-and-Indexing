<ABSTRACT>
A tape (3) comprises a biodegradable carrier and a water soluble dye, and is buried in soil (4) above a service such as a pipe (2). The tape (3) may comprise ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer made biodegradable by the presence of starch. Upon biodegradation of the tape, the water soluble dye dissolves in soil moisture and diffuses in the soil above and below the original position of the tape. When it is desired to uncover the service (2), the soil is removed until the coloured band of soil is uncovered. This gives a warning that the service is positioned immediately below the coloured band of soil.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE AND METHOD FOR INDICATING UNDERGROUND OBJECTThe present invention relates to a device and method for indicating the presence of an underground service or other underground object.The underground service may comprise electrical power cables, gas lines, water and sewage pipes, transmission lines, and like installations which are commonly run beneath the surface of the ground between terminals or outlets. It is well known that such services are often required to be located and accessed, for example for maintenance or repair work to be carried out. In such circumstances, an excavator may have only an approximate guide to the position of the service to be accessed. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide some form of positive indication to the excavator as to the position of the service once excavation has commenced. Another circumstance is that the excavator may know the horizontal location of the service, but may not know the depth, so that there is a need for means for indicating the depth of a service.In other cases, excavation may be being carried out for reasons unrelated to the underground service, and an excavator may be unaware of the presence of the service in the excavation region. In these cases,, the provision of means indicating the presence of the service may act as a warning to the excavator, and so reduce the likelihood of damage to the service, or harm to the excavator, occurring during excavation.It is known, for example in US Patent 3504503 (Allen) to bury in the ground a coloured tape positioned above an underground service to indicate the 

 location of the service. When an excavator is digging to locate the service, it is intended that the tape is torn and brought up with earth so as to indicate the position of the service. The tape is easy to lay because it can be paid out from a reel, but it has the disadvantage that, it may be removed when mixed with soil and may not be seen by the excavator. It is also known, for example in US Patent 3115861 (Allen), to indicate the position of an underground service by depositing in the ground above the service a water insoluble pigment mixed with a filler so as to give a volume of coloured material in the ground. The filler may be an organic substance such as to disintegrate or disappear so as to leave the coloured pigment in the soil. This gives a volume of coloured material, but is less convenient to lay than a tape.It is an object of the present invention at least in preferred embodiments, to provide-a device and method for indicating

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS
1. A device for indicating the presence of an underground object comprising a carrier and a coloured material carried by the carrier, the carrier being biodegradable to leave the coloured material in the soil, in which the coloured material is a water soluble dye whereby the coloured material dissolves in soil moisture and diffuses into the soil beyond the position of the carrier.
2. A device according to claim.1 in which the carrier is in the form of an elongate strip of material.
3. A device according to claim 1 in which the coloured material is distributed throughout the carrier.
4. A device according to claim 1 in which the carrier comprises a biodegradable plastics material.
5. A device according to claim 4 in which the carrier consists of a non-biodegradable polymer and a biodegradable organic material.
6. A device according to claim 5 in which the non- biodegradable polymer is present in the range 40 to 80 per cent by weight of the device.
7. A device according to claim 5 in which the biodegradable organic material is present in the range 5 to 40 per cent by weight of the device.
8. A device according to claim 5 in which the water soluble dye is present in the range 1 to 40 per cent by weight of the device. 


 9. A device according to claim 5 in which the non- biodegradable polymer is ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer.
10. A device according to claim 5 in which the biodegradable organic material is starch.
11. A device according to claim 1 in which the device comprises 50 to 70 per cent by weight of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, 10 to 30 per cent by weight of starch, and 10 to 30 per cent by weight of the water soluble dye.
12. A method of indicating the presence of an underground object comprising burying in the ground in the vicinity of an underground object a device comprising a biodegradable carrier and a coloured material carried by the carrier, and allowing the carrier to degrade to leave the coloured material in the soil, in which the coloured material dissolves in soil moisture and diffuses into the soil beyond the position of the carrier.
13. A method according to claim 12 including laying the device in the form of an elongate strip aligned along the length of an elongate underground service and positioned at a higher level than the underground service.
