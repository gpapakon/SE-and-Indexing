<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to porphyrinogenic resin systems and methods for their 
manufacture, and to coating compositions and methods involving such resins. 
The invention is particularly concerned with anti-corrosion coatings derived 
from such resins. In International Patent Application No. PCT/AU91/00298, we described how 
the condensation of a beta-unsaturated aldehyde, especially crotonaldehyde, 
and pyrrole can give rise to a monomeric product which contains porphyrinbearing 
unsaturated substituents. This monomeric material, which we referred 
to as a "polymerisable porphyrin", then readily polymerises to produce 
polymeric product. 
Polymers made from the monomeric material, or copolymers formed from the 
polymerisable material and at least one other polymerisable monomer of a 
known type, can be used in the production of films, coatings and other 
structures. It is an object of the present invention to provide polymerisable resins and/or 
compositions derived from them which have improved properties such as, for 
example, improved anti-corrosion properties. We have found that this and other objectives can be achieved by reacting a 
cyclic ketone with pyrrole or an N-alkyl pyrrole, either of which may contain 
one or more suitable substituents, or a mixture of two or more such pyrroles. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a 
polymerisable resin comprising a porphyrinogenic ring system produced by the 
reaction of:  
 
(a) one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of pyrrole and 
N-(lower)alkyl pyrroles, any of which may be ring substituted with one or more 
non-deleterious substituents, with (b) a C4-C6 saturated alicyclic ketone which is capable of reacting with the 2 or 
5 position of the pyrrole ring. The reaction generally requires the presence of an acid catalyst, which is 
selected to suit the particular chosen reagents (a) and (b). The catalyst may 
be an inorganic acid, or an organic acid, such as acetic or propionic acid, or an 
acid anhydride, such as phthalic anhydride. Organic acids which contain 
unsaturated groups may be used. These acids may become incorporated into 
and provide functional groups in the resin product, as well as providing a 
catalytic function. Acids containing vinyl groups, such as acrylic acid, or triple 
bonds, such as acetylene dicarboxylic acid, are especially useful in this regard. Inorganic acids, especially the hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, may 
also be used either alone or with an organic
