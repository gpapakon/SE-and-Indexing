<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a wiring harness which includes insulation coated wires, 
connectors, and junction blocks, with corrugate tubes, grommets and the like 

exteriorly mounted thereon, wherein both insulation coatings of the insulation 
coated wires and housings of the connectors are made of nylon 12, thereby 

facilitating recovery and reuse of the wiring harness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automotive wiring harnesses for transmitting
electric power and electric signals and including electric wires, connecting
terminals, relays, fuses and the like.Wiring harnesses generally comprise insulation coated wires, connectors, relay
boxes and the like. For ease of mounting the harnesses in automotive vehicles and
for protection of the harnesses, exteriorly mounting parts such as protectors and
grommets are also used together with the harnesses.The components are made of respectively suitable materials as shown in Table
1. It is accordingly necessary to disassemble and classify the wiring harnesses for
each component in recovering the wiring harnesses from out-of-use automotive
vehicles for reuse of materials.

and some components are readily classified but others are
not. Specifically, the exteriorly mounting parts such as
grommets, and relay boxes are removed relatively easily. On
the other hand, insulation coated wires and connectors
which are key parts of the wiring harnesses are very
difficult to disassemble and remove because of increase in
the number of wires, divergence of the wires in various
directions, and multipolarity and complexity of the
connectors.In recovery of the components, the components are once
mechanically crushed and then classified by the use of
different specific gravity and conductivity thereof. The
processes of classification are complicated and are greatly
prone to cause foreign materials to mix in the components,
