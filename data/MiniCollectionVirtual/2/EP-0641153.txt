<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a planar, subsurface electronic 
circuit having at least one electronic circuit component 

assembled therewith comprises forming three dimensional, 
essentially square channels (14) interspersed with lands 

within a dielectric material (12) on a substrate (10). The 
channels are then filled in one pass with a curable 

polymeric material (16) containing a conductive metal 
filler so that the upper surfaces of the circuit trace 

formed by this conductive material are at essentially the 
same level as the upper surface of the lands. Circuit 

components (20) are placed to engage the conductive 
material. The curable material is then cured after placing 

the electronic component(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved 
method of making electronic circuits. More 
particularly, this invention relates to an 
improved method of making subsurface 
electronic circuits by filling channels in 
dielectric material with electrically conductive 
polymeric materials. Most electronic circuits on rigid 
substrates are still made by well known methods of 
etching copper-clad boards. A rigid dielectric 
substrate is first covered with copper or other 
electrically conductive material. Then, after 
temporarily protecting that portion of the 
conductive layer that will form the desired 
circuit trace, a substantial amount of this layer 
is chemically etched away. The protection is then 
removed, leaving copper traces in desired 
locations. One or more circuit components are 
attached to the circuit traces, usually by melting 
eutectic tin-lead solder. Highly toxic materials used in these 
conventional methods have been, and continue to 
be, of great concern to individuals and the 
environment. Large amounts of water used in such 
methods have been discharged from manufacturing 
sites bearing trace amounts of metallic residues 
(lead, tin and copper, for example) as well as 
cyanides and other harmful wastes. Millions of 
rejected, worn out or obsolete electronic products 
containing such substances have been disposed in 
landfills where they are, or some day may be, 
pollutants of runoff or ground water.  
 
Additionally, millions of tons of ozone-destroying 
chlorofluorocarbons ("CFCs"), used to clean solder 
residues, have been released into the atmosphere 
from this source alone. Planar subsurface electronic circuits 
made by filling channels in rigid dielectric 
substrates with electrically conductive materials, 
though not new per se, are not extensively used. 
For example, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin 
Vol. 27, No. 5, October, 1984, "Subsurface 
Circuitry On Polymeric Substrates", by E.W. Mace, 
discloses a method of forming subsurface circuits 
in an injection-moulded substrate having angled 
wall channels. A compliant elastomeric blade or 
squeegee is used to fill the channels with a 
polymeric thick film conductive paste. The paste 
was drawn across the surface of the substrate 
using the squeegee to fill molded-in circuit 
lands. The substrate was then turned 90째 and the 
filling process was repeated. The paste was dried 
and cured to its final state, following which 
excess cured paste was buffed away. Only then 
were circuit components attached to the cured 
conductive-paste-filled
