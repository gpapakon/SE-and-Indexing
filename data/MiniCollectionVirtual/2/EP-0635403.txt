<ABSTRACT>
Cold pressurized pure inert gas (e.g. argon or 
nitrogen) is delivered to an air bag (1) with the addition 

of mechanical energy to aid in filling the bag (1) by an 
inflator (10) comprising a high strength container (12) or 

bottle having a cylindrical section (16) that is filled 
with inert gas. A piston (18) is located at one end (20) 

of the cylindrical section (16) with a high energy 
pyrotechnic material (24) behind it. Both sides of the 

piston (18) are at the same pressure during storage. An 
initiator (26) is located in the high energy pyrotechnic 

material. A burst disk (32) is located at the opposite end 
of the cylindrical section (16). When the initiator (26) 

is fired, the piston (18) is driven down the length of the 
cylindrical section (16). When the pressure in the 

container (12) exceeds the burst disk strength, the inert 
gas expands into the air bag (1) or apparatus needing to be 

filled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inflator for an 
inflatable air bag, and more particularly, to an 
inflator that is operative to fill such an air bag with 
a pure inert cold gas. An inflatable air bag is a safety device for 
protecting automotive vehicle occupants in a collision. 
When the vehicle strikes or is struck by a harm 
producing object, a sensor detects the change in motion 
and fires a detonator. This releases gas under high 
pressure from an inflator into a folded inflatable air 
bag. The air bag expands and provides a protective 
cushion that restrains the driver or passenger against 
various impact conditions. Many types of inflators have been disclosed in the 
art for inflating an air bag for use in an inflatable 
restraint system. One involves the utilization of a 
quantity of stored compressed inert gas which is  
 
selectively released at the stored temperature to 
inflate the air bag. Another derives a gas source from 
a combustible gas generating material which, upon 
ignition, generates a quantity of hot gas sufficient to 
inflate the air bag. In a third type, the air bag 
inflating gas results from a combination of stored 
compressed inert gas and a gas generating material. The 
last mentioned type, commonly referred to as an 
augmented gas or hybrid inflator, delivers hot gas to 
the air bag. As disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,756,621 granted 
to Donald J. Lewis, et al. on September 4, 1973, the 
use of a stored quantity of compressed argon, an inert 
gas, is advantageous. Compressed air and compressed 
nitrogen have specific problems related to their use. 
Air is not inert and when compressed to relatively high 
pressure becomes a source of significant hazard. 
Nitrogen is relatively inert when compressed but 
contributes to the production of nitrogen oxide 
especially when intermixed with hot gases generated from 
combustion. The inflator may comprise a quantity of high 
pressure inert gas in a storage cylinder or bottle. An 
advantage accrues, however, where a stored compressed 
gas augmented by a generated gas is utilized. This 
advantage involves the addition of energy to the stored 
compressed gas to aid in filling of the air bag. 
Current technology with hybrid inflators to obtain this 
advantage is to heat the stored high pressure gas 
with some type of pyrotechnic. Such hybrid inflators, 
however, are subject to a disadvantage, even when argon 
is used as the stored compressed gas, because the gas 
delivered to inflate the air bag is hot and is 
intermixed with a gas

An inflator (10) for delivering pure inert cold gas 
to an airbag (1) comprising, 

   a container (12) in which a pressurized cold pure 
inert gas is stored, said container having a first end (20) 

and a second end, said container including a cylindrical 
section (16) positioned between said first end (20) and 

said second end and having an outlet conduit (36) 
positioned at said second end, said outlet conduit (36) 

being sealed by a burst disk (32) that ruptures upon a 
predetermined increase of pressure in said container (12), 

   a piston (18) in sealed, slidable relation over 
substantially the full length of said cylindrical section
