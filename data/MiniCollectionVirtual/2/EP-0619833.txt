<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the polymerization 
of lactide (either S or R) using a scandium, 
yttrium or lanthanide series rare earth metal based 
catalyst. Lactides are presently polymerized to high 
molecular weight plastics using tin, titanium, zinc and 
other metal based catalysts by ring opening 
polymerization of the cyclic ester: 
The resulting polymers of lactide are useful in medical 
applications such as wound closure devices, orthopedic 
implants, controlled release drug carriers, as well as 
degradable paper coatings and plastic packaging films. A. J. Nijenhuis et al., disclosed lactide could be 
polymerized using Sn(acetylacetonate)₂ and substituted 
Zn(II) acetylacetonate complexes as catalyst. They 
claimed the very high crystallinity polymer was produced 
because the polymerization rate was lower than the 
crystallization rate, thus allowing polymerization 
directly onto the p-lactide crystal (Polymer Bull. 
(1991), 25, pp. 71-77).  
 U.S. Patent 4,853,459 discloses ring-opening 
polymerization of cyclic carbonates at 200-350°C using 
coordination compounds of lanthanides such as Cerium 
tris(acetylacetonate). Shen, Z.; Sun, J. and Wu, L., Huaxue Xuebao, 48(7), 
pp. 686-689 (1990), disclose solution polymerization of 
DL-lactide using a mixture of aluminum alkyls, rare 
earth compounds, and water. U.S. Patent 5,028,667 discloses the polymerization 
of various lactones including lactide using yttrium and 
lanthanide series rare earth based catalysts. The present process relates to a process for the 
polymerization of lactide and optionally up to 20 mole % 
based on lactide of one or more lactones selected from 
by contacting lactide and the optional lactone with one 
or more catalysts having the formula MZ₃, wherein n is 4 
or 5, h, i, k, and m are independently l or 2, each R is 
independently selected from hydrogen or hydrocarbyl 
containing up to 20 carbon atoms or substituted 
hydrocarbyl containing up to 20 carbon atoms, M is 
chosen from scandium, yttrium, or a lanthanide 
series rare earth metal, and Z can be the same or 
different and are selected from the group of highly  
 
coordinating ligands consisting of beta-diketonates such as 
2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptan-3,5-dionate and acetylacetonate, 
fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, 
carboxylate, tetrasubstituted porphyrinato (-2), 
phthalcyanato (-2), beta-ketoester anions such as 
methylacetoacetate, dialkylmalonate anion, 
cyclopentadienide, pentamethylcyclopentadienide, and 
aryloxide such as phenoxide, and preferably at
