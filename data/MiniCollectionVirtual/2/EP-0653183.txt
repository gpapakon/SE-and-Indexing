<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a method and a ventilator device for 
measuring the functional residual capacity, FRC, of lungs. A 

trace gas is mixed with a breathing gas in a gas mixer (14) 
and fed into the lungs (8) via an inspiratory tube (6). When 

a predetermined concentration of trace gas is achieved in 
the lungs (8), the supply of trace gas is stopped, and a 

washout phase starts. During the washout phase, the concentration 
of trace gas in expired gas and the flow of expired 

gas are measured. The measurement values are sent to an 
analyzer (18) which calculates the volume of trace gas in 

the lungs (8). Functional residual capacity can then be 
determined from the calculated volume of trace gas. The 

trace gas is appropriately SFâ‚†.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method by determination
of the functional residual capacity (FRC) of lungs.The invention also relates to a ventilator device for the
determination of the functional residual capacity.The functional residual capacity is the volume of gas
remaining in the lungs and airways at the end of a normal
expiration. This gas volume serves, inter alia, as a reservoir
of oxygen for the body. A reduction in FRC affects a
plurality of functions in the respiratory organs, such as
airway resistance, lung compliance, the distribution of
inspired gas and arterial oxygenation. It is therefore an
advantage if FRC can be measured in a simple way as one step
in diagnosing a patient. Measurement of FRC is also useful
during anaesthesia, since the administration of an anaesthetic
reduces FRC.One way of measuring FRC is described in a doctoral thesis
entitled "Measurement of Functional Residual Capacity by
Sulphur Hexafluoride Washout" (pp. 11-15) by C. Jonmarker,
Dept. of Anaesthesia and Clinical Physiology, University of
Lund, Lund 1985. An inert, non-toxic trace gas, sulphur
hexafluoride, SF6, is fed into the lungs of a patient during
a washin phase. The gas is supplied directly to the lungs
through a tracheal tube arranged after a gas meter. The gas
meter measures the concentration of SF6 in gas expired from
the lungs. After a number of respiratory cycles, an equilibrium
will arise, in which the concentration of SF6 in the
lungs is the same as the concentration of SF6 supplied in
inspired gas, e.g. 0.5% which is less than the hygienic 
limit value for SF6. A washout phase, in which the administration
of SF6 is stopped, then starts, and the lungs are
gradually emptied of SF6. During this washout phase, the
concentration of SF6 in expired gas and the flow of expired
gas are measured. The washout phase continues until the
concentration drops below a defined level, e.g. 0.01%. The
total volume of SF6 washed out of the lungs is then calculated
from the values measured for concentration and flow. A
correction is made to compensate for the rebreathing of a
certain amount of gas in the transition from expiration to
inspiration. FRC is then calculated as the volume of SF6
divided by the concentration of SF6 at the end of the washin
phase. This concentration is regarded as the concentration
in the alveoli. During the actual measurement, the gas meter
is periodically zeroed during the inspiratory phases. As a
rule, the gas meter is calibrated with a test gas before the
system is connected to a
