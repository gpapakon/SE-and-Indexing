<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to control and damp with as few actuators 
as possible, vibrations generated in various directions on the bed of an automatic 

transport vehicle employed in clean rooms and other facilities. The automatic transport 
vehicle of the present invention comprises a truck (1a) and bed (1b) elastically supported 

with respect to the truck, a plurality of actuators (36) installed between them with inclined 
lines of action, sensors (40) which detect acceleration in the direction of the lines of 

action of these actuators, vibrations being suppressed by controlling the driving force of 
the actuators in accordance with the acceleration detected by the sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automatic transport vehicles used in the transport
of silicon wafers and other loads in clean rooms, and in particular, relates to the
prevention of vibrations in automatic transport vehicles.As unmanned industrial vehicles, such as the aforementioned automatic transport
vehicle, are not provided with suspension mechanisms such as those found in ordinary
automobiles, they are inevitably subjected to vibrations and shocks due to unevenness on
the road surface or track. In automatic transport vehicles used to transport loads in the
above-mentioned clean rooms, it is therefore necessary to pay heed to the prevention of
vibrations so that the vibrations do not produce chipping of the semiconductor wafers or
other payloads. Japanese Patent Application, Laid-Open No. H4-59465 discloses details
of examples of conventional vibration-prevention techniques used in such applications.
We will explain the conventional vibration-prevention techniques outlined in this
publication.FIG. 15 is a diagram showing a first conventional example. Reference numeral 1
represents a carrier truck, and this carrier truck 1 is constructed such that damping rubber
2 is installed between truck body 1a and bed 1b as a spring component. The relationship
between the vibration frequencies and vibration transmission ratio (the ratio of the
displacement z0 of truck body la and the displacement z of load 3) for the vibrations
produced in truck body 1a when load 3 is carried on the aforementioned bed 1b and the
truck travels on grating 4 is shown in FIG. 16.FIG. 16 shows how in passive damping systems such as in the above-mentioned
first conventional example, the vibrations from truck 1a are absorbed through the
vibration-isolating action of the aforementioned damping rubber 2 in the higher frequency
region above the natural frequency of the vibrating system illustrated in FIG. 15.FIG. 17 shows a second conventional example which is an improved version of
the aforementioned first conventional example. This second conventional example
employs an active system which attempts to suppress vibrations using actuators. In this
conventional example, acceleration sensor 8 is fitted to bed 1b of truck 7, and
electromagnets 9 and 10 are fitted to truck 1a so as to drive load 1b upwards and
downwards. Vibrations in bed 1b are damped through the action of attractive or
repulsive forces between truck 1a and bed 1b, controlled by electromagnets 9 and 10
according to the acceleration detected by acceleration sensor 8. As for
