Selector lever arrangement for an automatic gearbox of 
a motor vehicle, comprising 


a selector lever housing (2) disposed on the vehicle 
floor and 
a selector lever (10) pivotable about a horizontal 
transverse axle (9), 
 
wherein 


the selector lever housing (2) is dome-shaped with side 
walls (3 to 6) serving inter alia to receive the 

transverse axle (9) and is covered on top by a 
parallel-walled notched member (14) and a cover (20) 

with a gate, 
the selector lever (10) has at its top a hand grip (11) 
with a control knob (12), in the region of the catch 

member (14) a catch device (19) that can be operated by 
means of the control knob (12), and at the bottom a 

mounting member (13) by means of which the selector 
lever (10) is pivotally mounted on the transverse axle 

(9), and 
the mounting member (13) is provided with connecting 
means which is coupled with linkage means (27) which 

transfers the selection movement to a shift input 
element of the automatic gearbox, 
 
characterised by the following features: 


the connecting means (21) comprises an upper toothed 
segment (22) extending beneath the transverse axle (9), 
a lower toothed segment (23) is pivotable about a lower 
horizontal transverse axle (24), and is in engagement 

with the upper toothed segment (22), 
a lever arm (25) is connected non-rotatably to the 
lower transverse axle (24), and 
a Bowden cable linkage (27) is linked to the free end 
(26) of the lever arm (25) as the linkage means. 
Selector lever arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised by the following features: 


the mounting member (13) and the upper toothed segment 
(22) of the connecting means (21) are in the form of an 

integrally moulded part of plastics material, and 
the lower toothed segment (23) and the lever arm (25) 
are in the form of an integrally moulded part of 

plastics material. 
Selector lever arrangement according to claim 1 or 
claims 1 and 2,
 
characterised by the following features: 


the upper toothed segment (22) is provided with a cam 
segment (28) extending above the horizontal transverse 

axle (9), and 
the cam segment is provided with a plurality of notches
