<ABSTRACT>
A three component kit of parts for use in a method of destroying target cells in a host is provided. The first component comprises a target cell-specific portion and an enzymatically active portion capable of converting a cytotoxic pro-drug into a cytotoxic drug. The second component is a cytotoxic pro-drug convertible by said enzymatically active portion to the cytotoxic drug. The third component comprises a portion capable of at least partly restraining the component from leaving the vascular compartment of a host when said compound is administered to the vascular compartment, and an inactivating portion capable of converting the cytotoxic drug into a less toxic substance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INACTIVATION OF CYTOTOXIC DRUGS>t.This invention relates to cytotoxic drug therapy and, more specifically, to the inactivation of cytotoxic drugs to limit their undesirable side effects. 5One of the main limitations of conventional cytotoxic therapeutic agents is their lack of discrimination between cancer cells and normal replicating cells which are essential for normal tissue integrity and body function. The effects of cytotoxic agents on these normal tissues limits the dosage of cytotoxic therapy 10 or the duration of its administration. Cytotoxic drug therapy is therefore interrupted at frequent intervals to allow normal tissue recovery. Such interruption also allows recovery of surviving cancer cells and may be important in allowing the emergence of drug resistance.15 The duration of drug free intervals in therapy usually exceeds the duration of cytotoxic agent administration. This applies to all forms of cytotoxic therapy but is particularly evident in the case of those agents that interfere with DNA replication during S phase of the cell cycle.20 A method for the treatment of various cancers known as Antibody-Directed Enzyme Pro-drug Therapy (ADEPT) has been described (Bagshawe 1987 Br. J. Cancer 56, 531-2; 1989 60, 275-281) and is undergoing early clinical trial in which an antibody, or antibody fragment, directed at a tumour-associated antigen expressed by at least some cells in the cancer target, is conjugated to25 an enzyme and used to convey that enzyme to the cancer sites. The enzyme in the conjugate is matched by a subsequently administered prodrug which is a relatively non-toxic substance and is a substrate for the enzyme, the end- product of the reaction being an active cytotoxic drug which is able to diffuse through the tumour and reach cells that do not express the target antigen. In30 such therapy it is desirable that the enzyme used should not normally be present 

 in significant amounts in human body fluids and that the prodrug is only subject to conversion to active drug by the targeted enzyme (WO88/07378).In the example of choriocarcinoma xenografts in nude mice, cited in WO 88/07378, clearance of the antibody enzyme conjugate is accelerated by the presence of relatively large amounts of the target antigen in the plasma which results in immunoconjugate formation. In this case, the accelerated clearance did not prevent localisation of the antibody enzyme conjugate at tumour sites although, in general, rapid clearance of the antibody enzyme conjugate from plasma results in poor
