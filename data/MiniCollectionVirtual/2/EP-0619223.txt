<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for water-washing storage and freight (transport) containers, in particular ships' tanks, with removal of residues of vegetable and/or animal fats and oils, in particular fatty acids, or mineral oils and paraffins. Problems have recurred here in the prior art since tanks having residues of vegetable oils are erroneously treated with cold fresh water or sea water, as a result of which typical white residues occur on the tank walls which can only be removed with difficulty. In addition, difficulties occur if the material to be stored or transported is to be changed and, e.g., an oil tank is to be changed over to methanol. The invention remedies this by a process having the following stages:       A. Carrying out a precleaning   a) making ready the required amount of fresh water in a separate clean reservoir (10), b) determining the water hardness (German hardness scale) of the fresh water to be used,   c) heating the fresh water to 50@ to 60@C, d) calculating the required amount of sodium carbonate and/or trisodium phosphate to be added, (amount: 41 g per 1@ on the German hardness scale in 1000 l of water) e) and addition of the same to the fresh water in order to establish a German hardness of 
<
 4@, f) if appropriate subsequent addition of trisodium phosphate for residual softening, (amount 100 g in 1000 l fresh water), the water being circulated by pumping during the addition of the chemicals, g) subsequent prewashing of the tank or container with some of the water softened in accordance with stages a) to f) via tank cleaning devices, in which case the temperature here must not undershoot 50@C and must always be kept above the melting point of the residues to be removed,   h) simultaneously removing the laden prewash water;     B.   i) charging the required amount of a further portion of the water softened in accordance with stage a) to g) into the tank or container to be washed, k) addition of a non-foaming, nonionic surfactant, (amount: 100 g in 1000 l of water(, l) washing the tank or container in closed circulation with the water softened under stages a) to g) and the nonionic surfactant added under stage k) via tank washing devices, the temperature in this case being kept above the melting point of the residue to be removed and above 50@,   m) removing the laden water of the main washing stage.

Method for cleaning storage and transportation tanks, particularly 
ships tanks, using water, accompanied by the removal of 

residues of vegetable and/or animal fats and oils, particularly 
fatty acids, or mineral oils and paraffins, characterized by the 

following stages: 

A. performing a precleaning 

a) making ready the necessary fresh water quantity in a separate, 
clean storage container (10), 
b) determining the water hardness (German hardness) of the 
fresh water to be used, 
c) heating the fresh water to 50 to 60°C, 
d) achieving the necessary sodium carbonate and/or sodium phosphate 
addition quantity (quantity: 41 g per 1° German hardness 

for 1000 l of water) 
e) and adding the same to the fresh water in order to obtain a 
German hardness of 
<
 4° 
f) optionally subsequent sodium phosphate addition for residual 
softening (quantity 100 g for 1000 l of fresh water), the water 

being circulated by pumping round during the addition of chemicals 
and 
g) subsequent prewashing of the tank or container with part of 
the water softened according to a) to f) using tank cleaning 

devices, the temperature not dropping below 50°C and always 
being above the melting point of the residues to be removed and 
h) simultaneous removal of the charged prewash water; 
B. 

i) filling the necessary quantity of a further part of the 
water softened according to a) to f) into the tank or container 

to be cleaned, 
k) addition of a foamless, nonionic surfactant (quantity: 100 
to 200 g for 1000 l of water) 
l) washing the tank or container in closed circuit with the 
water softened according to a) to f) and the nonionic surfactant 

added in k) by means of tank cleaning devices until there is a  
 

complete mixing (emulsion) with the oil, the temperature being 
kept above the melting point of the residue to be removed and 

above 50°C and 
m) removing the charged water of the main cleaning stage. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that in the 

case of tanks or containers with zinc-containing inner coating 
working solely takes place in stage d) with sodium phosphate 

(350 g of sodium phosphate for 1000 l of water), without using 
sodium carbonate. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that in 
stage c) the fresh water is heated to approximately 50°C and 

in stage e) the German hardness is adjusted to approximately 2 
to 3° and in stage f) to close to 1 to 2°. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that additionally 
70% by weight sodium carbonate is added in stage d). 
Method according to one or more of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that as surfactants use is made of fatty alcohol 

ethoxylates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates and other ethoxylates or 
alkanol amide, the latter being used in a quantity of 2000 g for 

1000 l of water. 
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the water softener setting is checked 

after performing stages a) to f). 
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the tank or container is subsequently 

rinsed with fresh water and/or treated with steam to ensure complete 
cleaning. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the tank 
or container to be cleaned is prewashed with hot sea water or  

 
fresh water exclusively in the case of mineral oil and/or paraffin 

residues. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that after 
stages e) and f) there are waiting times of approximately 30 to
