<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for fighting fire, in particular in comparatively small spaces, such as hotel rooms or cabins (1) in passenger ships. Preferably at least one releasing spray head (3) is positioned in the cabin (1) and at least one spray head (4) is positioned near the door (10) of the cabin, e.g. just outside the door. When a fire in the cabin releases the cabin spray head (3), this spray head (3) activates the door spray head (4) to produce a barrier of fog-like spray at the door, in order to prevent the fire and the smoke generated by it from spreading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an installation for
fighting fire, in particular for a comparatively small
space, such as a ship cabin or a hotel room, comprising
at least one spray head and releasing means for activating
said at least one spray head.US-A-3990518 discloses an automatic fire alarm
and extinguisher device in the form of a fire protection
unit. The fire protection unit comprises a smoke alarm
and a heat/flame alarm, a valve for controlling an extinguisher
fluid, means for controlling the valve in
response to action of the respective alarms, and at least
one extinguisher fluid outlet head.GB-A-1474680 discloses a fire extinguishing installation
which includes a plurality of fire sensors distributed
within a space and extinguishing medium
distributor heads spatially coordinated with the sensors
and arranged to be supplied with an extinguishing
medium through a pipe system.DE-A-3440901 discloses an apparatus which comprises
a plurality of spray heads for creating a fog-like
spray to suppress a fire.Especially in fires in passenger ships and hotels,
the smoke gases present a serious danger; the majority
of victims usually dying of smoke gas poisoning. With a
fire alight, arsonists often leave the cabin door or the
hotel room door open, with the desired result that both
the fire and especially smoke spread very rapidly, with a
devastating effect.The aim of the invention is to provide a new installation
for fighting fire, which is effective also in difficult
situations as just mentioned.According to the invention here B provided an installation for fighting
fire as set out in claim.In an embodiment of the invention
the releasing means is incorporated in the spray head
which is mounted on the wall above the door inside the
room or the cabin and which is arranged to produce a
barrier of fog-like spray inside the cabin or room, in front
of the door. This embodiment needs in principle no cooperating
spray head in the corridor and is easy to
install, which is of significance especially when a fire-fighting
installation is to be provided in a ready-built
ship.A barrier or curtain of fog-like spray near the door of
a room or a cabin effectively prevents a fire and the
smoke generated by it from spreading, and as the fire
sucks in air along the floor, this air brings with it water-fog
into the fire seat.The spray heads, their individual nozzles and the
mutual arrangement of the nozzles are preferably made
according to that which is presented in International patent
applications PCT/F192/00060,

<CLAIMS>
Installation for fighting fire, in particular for a comparatively
small space (1;31,31a,41,41a;61), such

as a ship cabin or a hotel room, comprising at least
one spray head (3,4;33,33a,34,43,43a;63) and

releasing means for activating said at least one
spray head (3,4;33,33a,34,43,43a;63), 
characterised
in that
 at least one spray head (4;34;63) arranged to have its main spray direction inclined at least to some extent downwards, which
is adapted on activation to produce a barrier of fog-like

spray (73,74), is disposed near a door
(10;40,40a,50,50a;70) of the space

(1;31,31a,41,41a;61) in said space (61),
mounted on a wall above the door (70) and

includes said releasing means, and 
in that
 the releasing
means is adapted to activate said at least one spray

head (4;34;63) near the door
(10;40,40a,50,50a;70) to produce the barrier of fog-like

spray inside the space, in front of the door.
Installation according to claim 1, wherein the spray
head (63) mounted on the wall comprises two nozzles

(83,84) directed obliquely to the sides, one
nozzle (82) directed obliquely downwards, and one

central nozzle (85) directed essentially straight out
from the wall, with one nozzle directed obliquely

upwards being closed by a plug (87).
Installation according to claim 1, comprising first
(3;33,33a,43,43a) and second (4;34) spray heads,

said second spray head (4;34) being activated by
said releasing means.
Installation according to claim 3, wherein said first
and second spray heads (3,4) are of releasing type

each comprising releasing means, and the release
of either one of the spray heads (3,4) is arranged to

activate the other of the spray heads (4,3).
Installation according to claim 3, wherein the second
spray head (4;34) is disposed in a space (2;32)

outside said space (1;31,31a,41,41a).
Installation according to claim 4, wherein the first
spray head (3) and the second spray head (4) disposed

near the door (10) are adapted, upon release
of either of them, to distribute extinguishing liquid to

the other than the activated spray head (4,3)
through an interconnecting branch line (7).
Installation according to claim 5, in particular for

ship cabins, wherein the first spray head
(3;33,33a,43,43a) is disposed in a ship cabin and

the second spray head (4;34) is disposed in the
middle of a cabin corridor (2;32).
Installation according to claim 1, wherein said
releasing means is a smoke detector arranged to

produce a signal to activate said at least one spray
head (4;34;63) disposed near the door

(10;40,40a,50,50a;70) of the space
(1;31,31a,41,41a;61).
