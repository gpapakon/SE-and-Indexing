<ABSTRACT>
An air pressure sensor (50) for a tire is described 
including a printed circuit board (72) which is a circuit 

board having a conductor, a contract screw (68) which is a 
fixed electrode, a resonance circuit having a coil (78) 

electrically connected directly to the conductor of the 
printed circuit board (72), and a diaphragm (62) which is a 

movable electrode which is set in a state of contact or 
non-contact with the contact screw (68) due to a change in 

internal pressure of the tire so as to change a resonance 
frequency of the resonance circuit. The contact screw (68) 

is electrically connected directly to the conductor of the 
printed circuit board (72). In this air pressure sensor 

(50) for a tire, a lead wire which has conventionally been 
used between the contact screw (68) and the printed circuit 

board (72) is eliminated, so that the occurrence of 
failures due to the faulty connection and the like of the 

lead wire is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air pressure 
sensor, and more particularly to an air pressure sensor for 
a tire used in an internal-pressure warning device for 
detecting a decrease in the air pressure of a tire and for 
warning the driver of the decrease when the air pressure of 
the tire has dropped below a predetermined value while the 
vehicle is travelling, and to a method of producing the air 
pressure sensor. A conventional air pressure sensor 10 for a tire will 
be described with reference to Fig. 12. A circular groove 
14a is formed in a metal base 14, and a substantially hollow 
cylindrical casing 12 with a bottom is fitted and soldered 
in this groove 14a, thereby forming a housing. A bellows-type 
diaphragm 16, which is formed of an electrically 
conductive resilient thin film, is fixed in a groove 14b by 
means of soldering. The groove 14b has a smaller diameter 
than the groove 14a formed in the inner surface of the metal 
base 14, and is arranged concentrically with the groove 14a. 
A diaphragm 18, which is formed of an electrically  
 
conductive resilient thin film, is connected to the top of 
the bellows-type diaphragm 16. A movable electrode is 
formed by the bellows-type diaphragm 16 and the diaphragm 
18. An airtight chamber 26, which is formed by the 
diaphragm 18, the bellows-type diaphragm 16, and the casing 
12, communicates with the air chamber of the tire by means 
of a communicating hole 34 provided in a substantially 
central portion of a flat surface 12a of the casing 12 which 
opposes the metal base 14. In addition, a hole 14c is 
formed in a substantially central portion of the metal base 
14. An electrically conductive contact rod 20 of a 
cylindrical shape is inserted through the hole 14c into a 
back pressure chamber 24 which is formed by the metal base 
14, the diaphragm 18, and the bellows-type diaphragm 16. 
The contact rod 20 is fixed and sealed to the metal base 14 
by a hermetic seal 28. A relay wire 36a is soldered to the 
end of the contact rod 20 which is located outside the 
sensor, and is connected to an unillustrated printed circuit 
board. A cylindrical electrode 38 has one end fitted in and 
soldered to a cylindrical recess 14d provided in an outer 
surface of the metal base 14, while a relay wire 36b is 
soldered to the other end of the electrode 38. The relay 
wire 36b is connected to the printed circuit board. A 
substantially hemispherical projection 22 is formed in the 
diaphragm 18 in such a manner as to project toward the back  
 
pressure
