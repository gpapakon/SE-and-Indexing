<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for location updating in a cellular radio network. The network stores subscriber data permanently in a home location register (HLR) and temporarily in visitor location registers (VLR) integrated with mobile services switching centers (MSC). In connection with a call setup, the HLR requests the VLR to provide routing information for the subscriber, whereafter the inbound call is routed to the pertinent MSC and the subscriber is paged by the radio path. In the invention, the network updates the location of the subscriber by check paging performed as a background run at suitable times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for location
updating in a cellular radio network comprising a home
location register for permanently storing location and
subscriber data on subscriber mobile stations registered
with the network, the geographic coverage area
of the network being divided into smaller service
areas each comprising a mobile services switching center
and a visitor location register for temporarily
storing subscriber data on mobile subscriber stations
currently located within said service area; the geographic
coverage area of each service area being further
divided into location areas comprising cells,
each of which incorporates at least one fixed radio
station capable of establishing a radio link with the
active subscriber mobile stations currently located in
the cell, the network comprising base stations and
subscriber mobile stations in a first system, said
subscriber mobile stations automatically informing the
network of their location area via base stations to
update location data, and base stations and mobile
stations in a second system, said mobile stations not
automatically informing the network of their location.Cordless telephone (CT) systems, such as the
digital cordless telephone system CT2, have recently
come out on the market. Such a system comprises a base
station, which is always based on access to an existing
fixed telephone network. There are three main
types of base stations: a residential base station, a
base station connected to a private branch exchange
(PBX) in an office or operating independently as a
PBX, and telepoint base stations, from which only outbound
calls are possible for a CT telephone.Since the present-day CT systems are regarded as 
PSTN subscriber connections (access points), a call is
addressed to the CT terminal equipment in the normal
way by dialing a telephone number in accordance with
the PSTN numbering scheme. On the basis of the telephone
number, the PSTN then routes the call to a
respective subscriber connection to which the CT residential
base station or the PBX of the CT office base
station is connected. The base station pages the CT
terminal equipment over the radio path by means of an
identity code determined by the numbering scheme of
the CT system, and sets up a call when the terminal
equipment responds. In practice, it is thus possible
to make a call to the CT terminal equipment only
through its residential or office base stations
(through predetermined subscriber connections).Accordingly, the numbering schemes of the present
CT systems

<CLAIMS>
A method for location updating in a cellular
radio network comprising a home location register

(HLR) for permanently storing location and subscriber
data on subscriber mobile stations (MS) registered

with the network, the geographic coverage area of the
network being divided into smaller service areas each

comprising a mobile services switching center (MSC1,
MSC2) and a visitor location register (VLR1, VLR2) for

temporarily storing subscriber data on mobile subscriber
stations (MS) currently located within said

service area; the geographic coverage area of each
service area being further divided into location areas

comprising cells each of which incorporates at least
one fixed radio station (BTS1-4) capable of establishing

a radio link with the active subscriber mobile
stations (MS) currently located in the cell, the network

comprising base stations and subscriber mobile
stations in a first system, said subscriber mobile

stations automatically informing the network of their
location area via base stations to update location

data, and base stations and mobile stations in a
second system, said mobile stations not automatically

informing the network of their location,
the method 
characterized
 in that the home location
register HLR of the subscriber mobile station in the

second system sends a command to perform check paging
of the subscriber mobile station to update location

data at suitable times to the visitor location register
VLR within the area of which the subscriber mobile

station is located according to the location data of
the HLR, upon which the VLR a) as a result of successful

cheek paging, updates its location data and
informs the HLR of the location of the subscriber 

mobile station, b) after a failed check paging, informs
the HLR that the subscriber mobile station was

not found, as a result of which the HLR updates the
location data of the subscriber mobile station.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that the command sent by the
HLR comprises information on the area in which the

paging is to be performed.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that the check paging is extended
if necessary in a predetermined manner to cover

several location areas or, preferably gradually, all
location areas of the service area.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,

characterized
 in that if the subscriber
mobile station is not found in the area of the first

VLR, the HLR sends a check paging command to some
other VLR or VLRs.
