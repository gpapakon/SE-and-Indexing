<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a contact element for electrically and mechanically connecting a contact area (4) applied to a glass carrier (3), in particular a busbar for heating conductors for vehicle windscreens, to a supply lead (18, 28), there is provided a contact part (8, 21), connected to the supply lead (18, 28), which is fixed in a contact holder (1) fixed on the glass carrier (3) and, under pressure, bears against the contact area (4). This clamp contacting ensures reliable contact-making and mechanical stability and is particularly suited for automated, mechanical production virtually without rejects. This holds true both for the production and the fixing of the contact holder (1) and for the production and the insertion of the contact part (8, 21) as well as its connection to the supply lead (18, 28). The reliability in terms of contact can in this case be matched in a simple manner to the requirements of the individual case by a corresponding choice of the magnitude of the contact pressure and of the contact area as well as of the material of the contact part (8, 21). Splitting the contact element into a contact part 8, 21 and a holder part (1) permits these parts to be designed largely independently of each other and thus an optimisation in terms of their function.

Contact element for the purpose of connecting in an electrical and
mechanical manner a contact surface, in particular a busbar for heat

conductors in motor vehicle windows, which contact surface is attached to a
glass carrier, having a connecting cable, at least consisting of a contact part

(8,21) connected to the connecting cable (18, 28), a contact surface (4)
attached to a glass carrier (3) and a contact holder (1) attached to the glass

carrier,

characterized in that the contact part (8,21) is disposed in the contact holder
(1) and under pressure abuts against the contact surface (4).
Contact element according to claim 1, characterized in that the contact holder
comprises at least one clamping screw which urges the contact part against

the contact surface.
Contact element according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one
compression spring (10, 24) is provided between the contact holder (1) and

the contact part (8,21).
Contact element according to claim 3, characterized in that the at least one
compression spring (10) is attached to the contact part (8).
Contact element according to claim 3, characterized in that the at least one
compression spring is attached to the contact holder.
Contact element according to claim 4, characterized in that the at least one
compression spring (24) is formed as one piece with the contact part (21).
Contact element according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
the contact part (8,21) can be releaseably attached in the contact holder (1). 
Contact element according to claim 7, characterized in that the contact part
(8,21) can be inserted into the contact holder (1) in a manner parallel with the

contact surface (4).
Contact element according to claim 7, characterized in that the contact part
(8,21) is releaseably attached in a latching manner in the contact holder (1).
Contact element according to claim 3, characterized in that the compression
spring forms the contact part and a tip jack is formed between the

compression spring and the contact holder for the purpose of receiving a
guide pin connected to the connecting cable.
Contact element according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
the contact holder (1) is adhered to the glass carrier (3) and/or the contact

surface (4).
Contact element according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized that
the contact holder (1) consists of ceramic material.
