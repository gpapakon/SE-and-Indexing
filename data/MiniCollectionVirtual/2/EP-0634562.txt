<ABSTRACT>
An integrated gasification humid air turbine is 
improved by (a) supplying at least a portion of the 

compressed air (10) to the cryogenic air separation unit 
(14) by withdrawing a portion of the compressed, gas 

turbine feed air (210) from the gas turbine feed air 
compressor (112,116); and (b) utilizing at least a portion 

of the heat of compression of the oxygen product (18) to 
heat water (224) to saturate the compressed, gas turbine 

feed air (120). At least a portion of the waste nitrogen 
product (16) can be fed to an intermediate stage of the gas 

turbine feed air compressor (112,116), or injected as a 
controllable inert gas coolant, diluent or mass flow 

enhancing component into at least one piece of equipment 
selected from the combustor (134), the transition piece 

(TP) and the gas turbine (138). Additionally or 
alternatively, at least a portion of heat inherent to the 

withdrawn portion of the compressed, gas turbine feed air 

(216) from the gas turbine feed air compressor (112,116) 
can be fed to the cryogenic air separation unit (14) to 

warm the portion (22) of the oxygen product (18) fed to the 
gasifier or partial oxidation unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
integration of a cryogenic air separation unit with a unit 
for the production of power using an integrated 
gasification humid air turbine (IGHAT) or an integrated 
gasification combined cycle (IGCC). More specifically, the 
present invention relates to an integration which reduces 
plant capital cost, increases the power output, and/or 
increases the efficiency at a fixed power output, and 
improves the operating flexibility of such power generation 
process. For the purposes of this patent specification, a humid 
air turbine (HAT) cycle is defined to be a combustion 
turbine power generation cycle where the waste heat from 
the expander exhaust and/or any oxidant compressor 
inter/aftercooler is used to water saturate and superheat 
the oxidant stream before it is fed to the combustor. The existing technology relating to integrated 
gasification humid air turbine and integrated gasification 
combined cycle power generation processes is disclosed in 
numerous scientific and patent references. The background art discloses a general concept of 
supplying feed to an associated air separation unit by 
removing a portion of the compressed air from the gas 
turbine air compressor. US-A-3,731,495 discloses a process 
in which the air separation unit feed is obtained from the 
gas turbine air compressor discharge at an elevated 
pressure, then cooled and further compressed to between 150 
and 400 psia (1 and 2.75 MPa) to feed the air separation 
unit. Similarly, US-A-4,224,045 discloses a process in  
 
which some or all of the compressed air feed to the air 
separation unit is obtained from the discharge of the gas 
turbine air compressor at elevated pressure then optionally 
cooled and expanded or compressed so as to provide feed to 
the air separation unit at a pressure greater than 85 psia 
(0.6 MPa). Other references disclose a similar elevated 
pressure air extraction from the gas turbine air compressor 
discharge to different air separation unit cycles; these 
references include US-A-5,081,845 and US-A-5,257,504. 
Finally, US-A-4,631,914 discloses the extraction of 
intermediate pressure air from an intermediate stage of the 
gas turbine compressor of a combustion power generation 
cycle, however, the extracted air is fed to an intermediate 
stage in the expansion turbine to generate work and does 
not involve any integration with an air separation system. The background art discloses a general concept of 
returning intermediate pressure waste
