<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for producing pure 6,13- 
dihydroquinacridone, which is a suitable intermediate for 

the production of a quinacridone pigment, the process 
comprising 


(i) heating a cylindrical reactor, which has an atmosphere 
free of molecular oxygen, so that at least one surface of an 

inner wall of the cylindrical reactor reaches a temperature 
of from 250 to 400°C; 
(ii) introducing 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic 
acid dialkyl ester, either in powder from or in the form of 

a mixture of powder with a liquid, through a feed port in an 
upper portion of the cylindrical reactor; 
(iii) maintaining the said powder or mixture in substantial 
contact with the inner wall of the cylindrical reactor such 

that an intramolecular alcohol-elimination reaction of the 
2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic acid dialkyl ester 

takes place; and 
(iv) removing the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone thus produced 
through an outlet in a lower portion of the cylindrical

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, which is an important
intermediate for the production of a quinacridone pigment,
from 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic acid dialkyl
ester industrially advantageously with facile procedures but
at a high purity and high yields and to a process for the
production of a quinacridone pigment.It is known that 6,13-dihydroquinacridone of the
formula (1), which is an intermediate for the production of
a quinacridone pigment,

   wherein X is hydrogen, F, Cl, Br, I, -OH, -NO2,
-CF3, a C1-C4 alkyl group, a substituted C1-C4
alkyl group, a C1-C4 alkoxy group, a substituted
C1-C4 alkoxy group, phenyl, cyclohexyl, phenoxy,
-COOH, -COO-C1-C4 alkyl, -SO3H, phenylamino,
benzamino, -N(CH3)2, -SO2NH2, -SO2(CH3)2,
pyridino, -CONH2 or -CON(CH3)2, and n is 0, 1, 2,
3 or 4,
can be produced by an intramolecular alcohol-elimination 
reaction of a 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic acid
dialkyl ester of the formula (2),

   wherein each of R1 and R2 is a C1-C4 alkyl group or
a substituted C1-C4 alkyl group, X is hydrogen, F,
Cl, Br, I, -OH, -NO2, -CF3, a C1-C4 alkyl group, a
substituted C1-C4 alkyl group, a C1-C4 alkoxy
group, a substituted C1-C4 alkoxy group, phenyl,
cyclohexyl, phenoxy, -COOH, -COO-C1-C4 alkyl,
-SO3H, phenylamino, benzamino, -N(CH3)2, -SO2NH2,
-SO2(CH3)2, pyridino, -CONH2 or -CON(CH3)2, and n
is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, provided that each benzene moiety has at least one
hydrogen atom ortho to the -NH- group.The purity of the above intermediate is critical
for the purity and yield of a quinacridone as an end product
and the formation of a quinacridone pigment. It is known
that a properly substituted quinacridone can be obtained by
an oxidation of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone under predetermined
conditions, while the purity of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone
affects the properties of a quinacridone as an end product.Therefore, studies have been hitherto made for
improving the purity of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, as are
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publications Nos.
