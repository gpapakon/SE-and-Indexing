<ABSTRACT>
A multiple bus interface is provided for connection to the bus of a 
data processing device. It includes a common interface adapted for 

connection to any one of several bus architectures for operation 
therewith. The interface adapter includes a control interface for 

accepting control signals from the bus of the data processing device, an 
address interface for accepting address signals from the data processing 

device, and a data interface for accepting data signals from the data 
processing device. A bus identifier is provided for identifying the bus 

architecture of the data processing device as will as a bus protocol 
decoder responsive to the bus identifer. The decoder derives its input 

from the control interface and is adapted to produce as an output 
standardized local control signals derived from the data processing bus 

control signals for sue by a local functional device to be accessed by 
the data processing device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiple bus interface adapter 
card that can connect to computers with different bus architectures with 
a single bus of a desired architecture. The IBM personal computer family was established as a standard 
which has been adopted by thousands of computer companies. Following 
from the inception of the first personal computer which used to PC bus, 
the personal computer AT was subsequently introduced by IBM and used a 
slightly different architecture called the AT architecture. This 
architecture has been used in the IBM Personal Computer AT, the IBM 
Personal Computer model 25, and 30, and other IBM computers and the 
personal computers produced by many companies worldwide.The AT bus has 
been accepted as the ISA standard for personal computers. Subsequent to 
the introduction of the AT, architecture IBM introduced the microchannel 
architecture, or the Micro Channel Bus as it is normally called. This 
bus was used in the IBM PS/2 Models 50,55,60,70,80,90,95, among others 
and in computers made by other companies. (IBM and PS/2 are trade marks 
of International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, New York.) 
Subsequent to the development architecture, advances were made in 
miniaturization of electronic circuits and memory such that it became 
possible to store tremendous amounts of data in a small format and the 
PCMCIA architecture was born. Other architectures have been developed 
such as the EISA architecture, the PCI Architecture and the VESA 
architecture. Different architectures have evolved in response to the 
evolution of computer microprocessor capabilities. To provide flexibility in the design of accessory boards for 
different bus architecture it would be desirable if a single integrated 
circuit could accommodate any of these bus architectures so that for 
instance an Infrared communications adaptor could be constructed for an 
AT, MCA or PCMCIA bus using the same integrated circuit. This would 
reduce the need for the development for ICs for each bus. In accordance with the present invention, there is now provided a 
multiple bus interface adapter for connection to the bus of a data 
processing device, the adapter comprising: common interface means for 
connection to any of several bus architectures, the common interface 
means comprising control interface means for accepting control signals  
 
from the bus of the data processing device, address interface means for 
accepting address signals from the data processing device, and data 
interface
