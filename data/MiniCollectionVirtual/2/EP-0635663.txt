<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a unique 
design for a piston in an air cylinder which 

eliminates or minimizes the occurrence of blowby. 
The present invention provides a piston with a 

beveled surface leading into the seal cavities on 
the open side of the seals. By providing this 

beveled surface: (1) air in the cylinder can get 
into the cavity and beneath the lip of the "U" cup 

seal to flair the seal against the cylinder wall 
thus achieving a positive seal; and (2) the 

"suction-cup" like tendency of the seal lips to 
adhere to the cavity walls in the event of 

temporary lip collapse is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air 
cylinders and more specifically to a new design for 
the pistons in such air cylinders which eliminates 
air blowby. Air cylinders are activated by compressed 
air with driving pressure and back pressure. In 
double acting cylinders, ports act as input and 
exhaust openings for air. The pistons in such a 
double acting cylinders commonly have two cavities 
for seals to prevent air leaking across the piston. 
Such an air leak, an undesirable occurrence, is 
commonly known as "blowby" to those of skill in the 
art. The seals commonly used on these pistons are 
of a "U" cup design. The "U" cup seal provides low 
breakaway, that is, a minimal air pressure is 
required to activate the cylinder. A blowby condition generally occurs when 
the lips of the seal fail to allow a sufficient 
amount of air to flair the seal against the 
cylinder wall, or some other factor inhibits 
sufficient seal lip contact with the cylinder wall. 
The seal must contact the cylinder wall 
sufficiently to achieve a positive seal. This 
blowby condition is compounded in pneumatic systems 
incorporating small components due to a low and 
sometimes insufficient air flow.  A blowby condition can also commonly 
occur when an air cylinder sits in a fixed position 
for a significant period of time. In some 
applications, air is continued to be drawn out of 
the cylinder creating a low pressure or vacuum 
which collapses the seal lips against the piston. 
Upon air pressure reversal for cylinder stroking 
the seals remain collapsed and a blowby condition 
results. The present invention provides a unique 
design for a piston in an air cylinder which 
eliminates or minimizes the occurrence of blowby. 
While the known pistons in the art provide two seal 
cavities for "U" cup seals having straight walls 
defining the cavities, the present invention 
provides a beveled surface leading into the 
cavities on the open side of the seals. By 
providing this beveled surface: (1) air in the 
cylinder can get into the cavity and beneath the 
lip of the "U" cup seal to flair the seal against 
the cylinder wall thus achieving a positive seal; 
and (2) the "suction-cup" like tendency of the seal 
lips to adhere to the cavity walls in the event of 
temporary lip collapse is prevented. FIG. 1 is a schematic, partial cross-sectional 
view of a typical prior art double acting 
air cylinder. FIG. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional
