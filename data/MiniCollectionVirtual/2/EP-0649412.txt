<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is that of certain substituted pyridinyl-2-propenoates,
and homologs thereof, which have been found to be useful for
treating diseases arising from or related to leukotrienes, particularly
leukotriene B4. As such there utility lies in antagonizing the affects of
leukotrienes.The family of bioactive lipids known as the leukotrienes exert
pharmacological effects on respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal
systems. The leukotrienes are generally divided into two sub-classes, the
peptidoleukotrienes (leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4) and the
dihydroxyleukotrienes (leukotriene B4). This invention is primarily
concerned with the hydroxyleukotrienes (LTB) but is not limited to this
specific group of leukotrienes.The peptidoleukotrienes are implicated in the biological response
associated with the "Slow Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis" (SRS-A).
This response is expressed in vivo as prolonged bronchoconstriction, in
cardiovascular effects such as coronary artery vasoconstriction and
numerous other biological responses. The pharmacology of the
peptidoleukotrienes include smooth muscle contractions, myocardial
depression, increased vascular permeability and increased mucous
production.By comparison, LTB4 exerts its biological effects through stimulation
of leukocyte and lymphocyte functions. It stimulates chemotaxis,
chemokinesis and aggregation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).Leukotrienes are critically involved in mediating many types of
cardiovascular, pulmonary, dermatological, renal, allergic, and
inflammatory diseases including asthma, adult respiratory distress
syndrome, cystic fibrosis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was first described by Borgeat and
Samuelsson in 1979, and later shown by Corey and co-workers to be
5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-(Z,E,E,Z)-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid.

It is a product of the arachidonic acid cascade that results from the
enzymatic hydrolysis of LTA4. It has been found to be produced by mast 
cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes and macrophages. LTB4 has been
shown to be a potent stimulus in vivo for PMN leukocytes, causing increased
chemotactic and chemokinetic migration, adherence, aggregation, degranulation,
superoxide production and cytotoxicity. The effects of LTB4 are mediated through
distinct receptor sites on the leukocyte cell surface that exhibit a high degree of
stereospecificity. Pharmacological studies on human blood PMN leukocytes indicate
the presence of two classes of LTB4-specific
