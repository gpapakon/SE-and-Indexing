<ABSTRACT>
A semirigid cigarette packet (1; 45) defined by a 
closed soft inner wrapping (2) normally made of foil, 

and by a cup-shaped outer container (3) formed from a 
semirigid blank (21; 47) and having an open end (4) for 

enabling access to a corresponding closed end (5) of the 
inner wrapping (2); the outer container (3) presenting 

longitudinal edges (14) with a flat or rounded bevel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semirigid 
packet for elongated elements, particularly cigarettes. In the following description, reference is made 
purely by way of example to a semirigid cigarette 
packet. The cigarettes coming off a production machine are 
normally formed into groups, each constituting the 
content of a "soft" packet, to which the following 
description substantially refers, or a rigid packet. Known soft packets normally comprise a closed 
inner wrapping, normally of foil and substantially in 
the form of a rectangular parallelepipedon; and a 
tubular lateral wrapping normally made of paper or 
similar, and which either covers only the longitudinal 
lateral walls of the inner wrapping, or is longer than 
the lateral walls and presents a projecting portion 
which is folded to form a soft cup-shaped outer 
container. The soft outer container is in the form of a 
rectangular parallelepipedon open at one end to enable  
 
access to a corresponding closed end of the inner 
wrapping. Known packets of the above type present several 
drawbacks, mainly due to the use of relatively soft 
wrapping materials which in no way provide for 
protecting the cigarettes against external stress. As yet, the above drawbacks have been solved by 
rigid hinged-lid packets which, however, are relatively 
expensive to produce. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a perfected packet which is relatively cheap to 
produce, of a cost comparable to that of known soft 
packets, and which, like rigid packets, provides for 
protecting the content against external stress. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a semirigid packet for elongated elements, 
particularly cigarettes, comprising a closed soft inner 
wrapping, and a cup-shaped outer container with an open 
end enabling access to a corresponding closed end of the 
inner wrapping; characterized in that the outer 
container is formed from a semirigid blank with 
preformed bend lines. The outer container and the inner wrapping of the 
above packet are preferably made integral with each 
other by a strip extending across said open end and 
integral, at its opposite ends, with the outer 
container. The above packet also preferably comprises a  
 
closed outer wrapping preferably made of transparent 
material and enclosing both the inner wrapping and the 
outer container. In general, the above packet is substantially in 
the form of a parallelepipedon with a rectangular base, 
and therefore presents sharp outer edges which may 
result

<CLAIMS>
A semirigid packet (1; 45) for elongated 
elements, particularly cigarettes, comprising a closed 

soft inner wrapping (2), and a cup-shaped outer 
container (3) with an open end (4) enabling access to a 

corresponding closed end (5) of the inner wrapping (2); 
characterized in that the outer container (3) is formed 

from a semirigid blank (21; 47) with preformed bend 
lines (22, 23, 24, 25, 27). 
A packet (1; 45) as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that the outer container (3) 
and the 
inner wrapping (2) are made integral with each other by 

means of a strip (16) extending across said open end (4) 
and integral, at its opposite ends (17), with the outer 

container (3). 
A packet (1; 45) as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that it also comprises a closed outer 

wrapping (18) enclosing both the inner wrapping (2) and 
the outer container (3). 
A packet (1; 45) as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that said outer wrapping (18) is made 

of transparent material. 
A packet (1; 45) as claimed in any one of the 
foregoing Claims, characterized in that said outer 

container (3) is in the form of a parallelepipedon with 
beveled longitudinal edges (14). 
A packet (1) as claimed in Claim 5, 
 

characterized in that said beveled edges (14) are flat 
beveled edges, each defined by a respective oblique face 

(15). 
A packet (45) as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that said beveled edges (14) are 

rounded beveled edges defined by respective rounded, 
substantially cylindrical surfaces (46). 
A packet (1; 45) as claimed in any one of the 
foregoing Claims, characterized in that said semirigid 

blank (21; 47) is substantially rectangular, and is 
defined on one side by a straight transverse edge (26) 

defining the edge of said open end (4), and on the other 
side by a transverse bend line (27); a number of tabs 

(34, 35, 36, 37) projecting beyond said transverse bend 
line (27); the other said bend lines defining a number 

of pairs (22, 23, 24, 25) of longitudinal bend lines 
defining a number of side by side panels (28, 29, 30, 

31, 32) between said edge (26) and said transverse bend 
line (27); and the lines in each said pair (22, 23, 24, 

25) of longitudinal bend lines defining a longitudinal 
strip (33) in turn defining a respective said beveled 

edge (14). 
A packet (1; 45) as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterized in that said side by side panels (28, 29, 

30, 31, 32) comprise two large panels (28, 29); and 
three small panels (30, 31, 32), a first of which is an 

intermediate panel (30) between the two large panels 
(28, 29), and the other two of which are outer panels 

 
(31, 32) of a width approximately equal to but no more

characterized in that a first (34) of said tabs (34, 35, 

36, 37) is substantially rectangular, and presents four 
beveled corners (38, 49) equal in length to the width of 

said strips (33); said bevels (38, 49) defining, on said 
first tab (34), two long sides (39) equal in length to 

the width of the large panels (28, 29) and one of which 
extends along said transverse bend line (27), and two 

short sides (40) equal in length to the width of the 
intermediate panel (30). 
A packet (1) as claimed in Claim 10, 
characterized in that each said corner presents a flat 

bevel (38). 
A packet (45) as claimed in Claim 10, 
characterized in that each said corner presents a 

rounded bevel (49). 
A packet (45) as claimed in Claim 12,
