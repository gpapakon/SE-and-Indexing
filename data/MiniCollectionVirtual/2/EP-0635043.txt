<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the reduction of 
electrode consumption in plasma torches in the processing and 
decomposition of hydrocarbons. From DD 292 920 is known a method of producing high quality 
carbon black by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons in a plasma reactor. 
The hydrocarbon stock can be gaseous, liquid or solid. The 
plasma can be formed by hydrogen or an inert gas such as argon, 
or by a mixture of hydrogen and a hydrocarbon gas, or by 
hydrocarbon gas alone. However, it is not disclosed that the 
use of a mixture of hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen gas as a 
plasma-forming gas will reduce or have any effect on the 
electrode consumption in the plasma reactor. From GB 1 400 266 is known a method of producing carbon black 
by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons in a plasma reactor. The apparatus 
consists of two electrodes located coaxially opposite each 
other. Hydrocarbons in a gaseous state is supplied for the 
formation of a plasma. Further, in order more fully to utilize 
the heat of the plasma and increase the yield, hydrocarbons can 
also be fed further down in the reaction chamber. However, it 
is not disclosed that the use of hydrocarbon gas as a plasma 
gas will reduce or have any effect on the electrode consumption 
in the plasma reactor. In the processing and decomposition of natural gas in a plasma 
torch a consumption of electrodes will take place which results 
in the need to have these replenished or replaced after a 
period of use. This consumption is undesirable since the 
consumption causes a shutdown of the process, which can be time 
consuming and which constitutes a break in production in 
addition to the consumption of expensive electrode material.  
 One alternative has been the use of renewable electrodes of 
graphite or carbonaceous material which can be continuously 
replenished and do not pollute the decomposition products. This 
will be cheaper than the use of non-consumable electrodes which 
are more complicated and more expensive in addition to their 
polluting the products. The object of the invention is to provide a method for reducing 
the electrode material in plasma torches intended for the 
decomposition and processing of hydrocarbons regardless of 
whether the electrodes are composed of renewable or consumable 
electrodes. This object is achieved by a method which is characterized by 
the features in the patent claims presented. The surprising discovery has been made that the hydrocarbons 
which are to be decomposed in the torch can be utilized in 
order to
