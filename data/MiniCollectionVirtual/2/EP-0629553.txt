<ABSTRACT>
A method of flat-packing an article of plastics foam, for 
example a pet bed including a cushion (2) and a surrounding 

sidewall (4), comprises the steps of locating the article (2, 
4) in an open-ended bag (20) of a flexible, airtight material 

such as transparent polythene and/or nylon, compressing the 
article (2, 4) such that air is expelled from the article (2, 

4) and from the bag (20) through the open end of the bag (20), 
and such that the article is flattened to a fraction of its 

original thickness, for example 20% of its original thickness, 
and sealing the open end of the bag (20) to retain the 

compressed article therein. The foam is preferably 
polyurethane that can recover to of the order of 95% of its 

original thickness even after prolonged compression of up to 
one year.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of packaging 
according to the preamble of claim 1, 
as well as to a package produced by the method. Such a method is known from US-A-4 418 514 and GB-A-2 124 580. Pet beds commonly comprise a fabric-covered foam cushion 
surrounded by an upstanding sidewall, usually circular or 
oval, the sidewall itself consisting of fabric-covered foam, 
some beds being provided with a reduced-height extent in the 
sidewall for entry to and exit from the bed by a pet, for 
example a cat or dog. Such beds are produced in a variety of sizes ranging from 
typically 35 cms to 106 cms in diameter, therefore being 
suitable for domestic animals ranging from small kittens to 
large dogs. Beds of this type are relatively bulky, and, although the 
different sizes of beds can be stacked one within the other, 
transportation, storage and display can pose problems. In particular, the area of shelf-space required to 
display such a product in its natural condition in a 
supermarket or like retail outlet is considerably more than 
is warranted by the financial yield from the product. It has been proposed, for the purposes of transportation, 
storage, and display, to remove the cushion from the bed, to 
wrap the cushion and sidewall up together, and to put the  
 
wrapped-up product in a cardboard sleeve. This clearly 
reduces the volume of the product, but has a number of 
disadvantages. In particular, the product is unattractive to the 
potential customer who can't fully appreciate what is in the 
package, while the foam used in conventional pet beds is not 
such that it springs back to its original shape if it has been 
left compressed in the sleeve for some time, and the space 
saved is not considerable compared with a nested set of beds. It would be desirable to be able to provide a method of 
packaging a foam article which overcame the aforementioned 
disadvantages, and in particular which produced a compact, 
attractive product. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
method of packaging according to the features of claim 1. Such a method enables a substantially flat-packed pet bed 
to be achieved. 
The material of the bag is preferably 
transparent whereby the flattened article can be viewed  
 
therethrough. Compression occurs in a plane substantially perpendicular 
to that containing the cushion and the flattened sidewall, and 
is preferably carried out to reduce the foam to of the order 
of 20% of its natural thickness. A preferred foam is a polyurethane foam that can

<CLAIMS>
A method of packaging a foam article comprising the 
the steps of locating the article in a bag (20) of a flexible, 

airtight material one end of which is open, compressing the 
article in such a manner that air is expelled from the article 

and from the bag (20) through the open end of the bag (20), 
and sealing the open end of the bag (20) 
characterised in that
 
the article is a pet bed including a foam cushion (2) 

surrounded by a separate upstanding sidewall (4) of foam, the 
method further comprising the steps of, prior to locating the 

article in the bag (20), removing the cushion (2) from the 
sidewall (4), flattening the opposed halves of the sidewall 

(4) against one another, and laying the cushion (2) on the 
flattened sidewall (4). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which compression 
occurs in a plane substantially perpendicular to that 

containing the cushion (2) and the flattened sidewall (4). 
A method as claimed claim 1 or claim 2 in which the 
article is compressed to of the order of 20% of its natural 

thickness. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 in 
which the cushion (2) and sidewall (4) are of polyurethane 

foam capable of recovering from its compressed condition to 
at least 95% of its original thickness. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 in 
which the compression step is carried out in such a manner 

that the bag (20) and pet bed therein are gradually compressed  
 

from the rear end of the bag (20) remote from the open end 
thereof towards the front end thereof. 
A method as claimed in claim 5 in which compression 
is achieved using a hydraulic press (6) comprising upper and 

lower platens (8, 10) hinged together and between which the 
pet bed and bag (20) are located, angular movement of one of 

the platens (8) relative to the other platen (10) about the 
hinge (12) resulting in said gradual compression of the pet 

bed in a direction from the rear end of the bag (20) towards 
the open end thereof. 
A method as claimed in claim 6 in which the press 
(6) incorporates means (16, 18) for sealing the bag (20) after 

the compression stroke. 
A method as claimed in claim 7 in which said means 
comprises a heat sealing mechanism the components (16, 18) of 

which are mounted one at or adjacent the free end of each 
platen (8, 10) to receive therebetween the open end of the bag 

(20) on completion of the compression stroke. 
A package comprising a pet bed including a foam cushion (2) surrounded 
by a separate, upstanding sidewall (4) of foam, the pet bed 

being packaged 
according to the method of any one of claims 1 to 8.
