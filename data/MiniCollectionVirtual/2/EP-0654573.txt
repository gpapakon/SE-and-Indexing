<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closing device for roof cases for motor vehicles, with a bottom part and a lid which are pivotable relative to one another on two mutually parallel sides, in each case via at least two hinges, about a hinge axis. The hinges each consist of a first hinge part (14), of the lid and of a second hinge part (15) assigned to the bottom part. Common to all the hinges is an actuating rod (23) which has hinge pins (30) displaceable parallel to the direction of the hinge axis (12). Each hinge pin (30) is guided displaceably in a bearing housing (21) assigned to the bottom part and can be brought into engagement with a sleeve (17) belonging to the first hinge part (14). A central actuation of all the hinges belonging to one side by the actuation of the actuating rod (23) towards the closed position or the open position is possible by means of a cylinder lock. An improved actuation and strength for the closing device is achieved by designing the actuating element as an actuating rod and by the fixed relationship of the hinge pins.

<CLAIMS>
A box, especially a roof luggage box (1) for motor
vehicles, having two box parts, i.e. a lower part (2) and

a lid (3) which, at each of two sides (4, 5) which are
parallel relative to one another, are hinged by at least

two hinges (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) per side to be pivotal
relative to one another about a hinge axis (i2, 13), with

the hinges (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) each consisting of a
first hinge part (14, 14a, 14b) comprising a sleeve (17,

17a) and a second hinge part (15, 15a, 15b) comprising
a hinge pin (30, 30a), with one hinge part being

associated with the lid (3) and the other one with the
lower part (2), and with the hinge pin (30, 30a) being

displaceable in such a way so as to engage, or being
disengaged from, the sleeve (17, 17a),

characterised in

that each second hinge part (15, 15a, 15b) comprises a
bearing housing (21), that the hinge pins (30, 30a) of

all hinges (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) associated with one side
are attached at a joint actuating rod (23) and form the

hinge axis (12, 13), that each actuating rod (23) is

guided in the bearing housings (21) associated with the
hinges (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) so as to be displaceable

parallel to the hinge axis (12, 13) in such a way that,
for the purpose of pivoting the lid (3) about the hinge

pins (30, 30a) of the hinges (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
associated with one of the sides (4, 5), the hinge parts

associated with the hinges of the other side are
disengaged by moving the associated actuating rod (23)

and that in one of the bearing housings (21) associated
with each side, there is rotatably supported a locking 

cylinder (34) which serves to displace the actuating rod
(23).
A box according to claim 1,

characterised in

that the sleeve (17, 17a) is attached to an angled arm
(19) provided with a fixing flange (18).
A box according to claim 1,

characterised in

that the actuating rod (23) is provided with a polygonal
pin (24) on to which there is mounted an actuating lever

(25) which is provided with a slot (28) which extends
vertically relative to the actuating rod (23) and which

is engaged by an actuating pin (36) provided for
displacing the actuating rod (23) and eccentrically

attached to the locking cylinder (34).
A box according to claim 1,

characterised in

that the bearing housing (21) of the second hinge part
(15, 15a, 15b) comprises a centring recess (39) for the

sleeve (17, 17a) of the first hinge part (14, 14a, 14b).
A box according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in

that the hinge pins (30) of all hinges (6 - 8; 9 - 11)
associated with one side ( 4, 5) are formed on to the

associated actuating rod (23).
A box according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in
 
that in the engaged condition, the hinge pin (30) passes

through the sleeve (17) and enters a bore (42) of the
bearing housing (21).
