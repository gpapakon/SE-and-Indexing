<ABSTRACT>
Polymers more suitable for use in organ transplantation are formed by coupling biologically active moieties to the free amino groups of polymers formed by incorporation of  alpha  amino acids into polymers formed of alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acids. In the preferred embodiment, the peptides are coupled to the free amino groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes the synthesis and
applications of a hydrolytically degradable polymer
useful in biomedical applications involving the
interaction of cells with the polymer structure.Over the years, there have been many successful
uses of polymers in medicine. Most of these
applications require minimal polymer cell
interactions. Consequently, there has been a lot of
work done on minimizing the interactions of these
polymer systems with the cells that they come in
contact with.However, one challenge in the area of biomedical
materials that has received less attention is the
development of substrates that can interact favorably
with mammalian cells either in vitro or in vivo. Such
materials could be useful for many applications from
the basic study of how cells interact with surfaces to
applied areas such as in vitro mammalian cell culture
for the production of useful materials and in vivo
cell transplantation for replacement of lost cellular
function.To illustrate the need for in vivo cell
transplantation, it is worth considering that the
success of whole organ transplantation is limited by
donor organ availability. As an example,
transplantation of the liver is often times successful
but has plateaued at about 2200 transplants per year
because of donor scarcity. Unfortunately, 30,000
Americans die every year of liver disease while an
additional 5 million Americans are affected. The cost
to the economy is more than $14 billion dollars
annually. The situation is similar with other organ 
systems such as the kidney, pancreas, lung, and heart.The demand for replacement organs is therefore
very high. However, since the function of most of
these organs is so complex and in most cases not yet
completely understood, synthetically recreating their
function is practically impossible. Alternative
treatments concentrate on manipulating the smallest
functional unit of the organ, the individual cell.
Many groups have attempted cell transplantation under
a variety of conditions (Bumgardner, G. L.; Fasola,
C.; and Sutherland D. E. R., "Prospects for Hepatocyte
Transplantation," Hepatology, 8, 1158-1161 (1988);

Regeneration of Artificial Cell Microencapsulated Rat
