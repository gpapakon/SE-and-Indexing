<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radiation-curable composition. This invention 
also relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive made from a radiation-curable 
composition. This invention further relates to substrates coated with a pressure-sensitive 
adhesive. Pressure-sensitive adhesives ("psa's") made from the 
photopolymerization of an alkyl acrylate (e.g., isooctyl acrylate) and a polar 
copolymerizable monomer (e.g., acrylic acid, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, etc.) are 
well known in the art; see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,181,752; 
4,364,972; and 4,243,500. Such acrylic-based psa's exhibit good adherence to 
high energy (i.e., polar) substrates such as metal and painted steel surfaces, but 
exhibit limited adhesion to low energy (i.e., nonpolar) substrates such as 
polyethylene and polypropylene. Additionally, whereas the acrylic-based psa's 
have good high temperature (e.g., 100°C) performance properties due to the 
presence of the polar copolymerizable monomers (which increase the cohesive 
or internal strength of the adhesive), they also exhibit limited adhesion at low 
temperatures (e.g., -45°C). Pressure-sensitive adhesives based upon polymers of alpha (α)-olefins 
are also well known; see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,635,755; 3,954,697; 
4,178,272; and 4,288,358 as well as EPO No. 416,921. Psa's based upon α-olefin 
polymers tend to exhibit good adhesion to low energy substrates, but only 
moderate adhesion to high energy substrates. Additionally, they have good 
low, but limited high, temperature performance properties. As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, acrylic- and α-olefin-based 
psa's do not individually exhibit a broad spectrum of desirable adhesive 
properties. Mere blending together of the two different psa's does not provide 
an acceptable adhesive because the resulting blend does not produce a psa with  
 
a wide spectrum of performance properties either. It was against this 
background that the development of a psa material which exhibits good 
adhesion to both low and high energy substrates as well as good high and low 
temperature performance properties was sought. By the present invention, it has been discovered that if certain alkyl 
acrylates, monoethylenically-unsaturated monomers copolymerizable therewith, 
and polymers of α-olefins are photopolymerized in the presence of a 
photochemically effective amount of a photoinitiator, results in a psa which 
exhibits a broad spectrum of desirable properties, e.g., both good high and low 
temperature performance properties
