<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dielectric resonator demultiplexer having a particular, 
but not necessarily an exclusive, application for communications satellite payloads. Satellite communication systems are used for a number of different purposes, 
for example, ground surveillance, and telecommunications. The cost of placing 
communications satellite payloads into orbit is very high and it is desirable to have 
compact, reliable and light weight resonator filter structures that are sufficiently rugged 
and stable to withstand both the high levels of vibration experienced by space 
hardware during the launch phase of a mission and also long term effects of repeated 
thermal cycling experienced over the duration of the mission. It is of importance to 
ensure in communication satellite payloads that a stable performance is maintained 
over a wide range of temperatures. With known demultiplexer arrangements for communication satellite payloads, 
the resonant filters of the demultiplexer are mounted on the payload such that the 
longitudinal axes thereof are substantially parallel to the payload mounting surface. With these arrangements, the area occupied by the demultiplexer, i.e. its 
"footprint", is fairly large and the mounting arrangement for the filters must be such 
that each of the resonator elements of the filters are not subject to undue mechanical 
and/or thermal stress. The resonator cavity walls of the known arrangements are relatively thin and 
thereby susceptible to induced mechanical/thermal stressing caused, in the main, by 
the mounting arrangements. It is usual for the mounting arrangement to be in the form of a composite base 
plate i.e. a carbon fibre base plate, which is relatively light, but extremely expensive.  
 
The composite base plate has a low coefficient of thermal expansion and thereby 
minimises thermal stressing of the filters. In order to minimise the transmission of mechanical stresses from the 
composite base plate to the filter, it is necessary to interpose shims, i.e. extremely 
thin washers, at each of the points where the base plate is mounted on the payload 
mounting surface. The correct shimming arrangement is difficult to achieve but, once 
in place, is effective to reduce mechanical stresses. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the foregoing problems by 
providing a dielectric resonator demultiplexer having a compact, rugged and stable 
structure that facilitates vertical mounting of the dielectric resonator filters and thereby 
minimises the
