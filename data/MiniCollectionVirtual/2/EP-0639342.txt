<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a frame for shelves which is formed from sheet-metal profiles comprising a foundation leg 1 and two side legs 2 which run at right angles thereto and are joined by two base legs 3 which run parallel to the foundation leg 1 and point towards each other and end at a distance from each other, assembly at the place of installation is to be made possible. For this purpose, the base legs 3 are joined by fastening legs 4 which run parallel to each other and at right angles to the base legs 3, protrude outwards and are equipped with lugs 5 which project from the inside of the fastening legs 4 and run obliquely with respect to the edge 8 of the fastening legs 4. These lugs 5 engage into perforations 14, connecting the sheet-metal profiles, of connecting parts 9 and lock into these perforations 14, which have a perforation wall 15 which runs in a manner corresponding to the course of the lugs 5 and behind which the lug 5 engages in each case.
