<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming porous articles with a varying pore distribution by extrusion from a billet with varying lubricant distribution. A single-polymer polytetrafluoroethylene is extruded and then stretched and sintered to provide a differential porous PTFE structure composed of fibers and nodes connected to one another by these fibers. The microfibrous structure has a portion within the cross section that possesses a different pore size, accompanied by a different node and fiber geometry, than adjacent areas within the cross section. A tube (10), having elongate nodes (12), fibrils (14), an inner surface (16) and an outer surface (18), of an expanded, porous fluoropolymer material, which is useful as a vascular graft, is formed. In a vascular graft, the pores taper inwardly, providing a fluid-tight lumen wall structure that prevents leakage, yet promotes cellular growth and natural tissue generation. A node structure of radially-oriented plates provides flexibility, suture strength, and enhanced protection against collapse.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many fluoropolymer materials, such as
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), are thermoplastic
polymers. That is, they have the property of
softening when heated and of hardening again when
cooled. PTFE is generally produced in the form of
white powder referred to as resin. It has a higher
crystalline melting point (327Â°C) and higher
viscosity than other thermoplastic polymers, which
makes it difficult to fabricate in the same manner as
other plastics.PTFE is a long chain polymer composed of CF2
groups. The chain length determines molecular
weight, while chain orientation dictates
crystallinity. The molecular weight and
crystallinity of a given resin prior to sintering are
controlled by the polymerization process.Currently, three different types of PTFE
resins are available which are formed from two
different polymerization processes. The three resins
are granular polymer, aqueous dispersions, and
coagulated dispersion products.In the coagulated dispersion of PTFE resin,
small diameter (0.1 - 0.2 micrometer) particles are
coagulated under controlled conditions to yield 
agglomerates ranging in size from 400 to 500
micrometers in diameter. The morphological structure
of these agglomerates can be considered as long
chains of PTFE that are intermingled in a tangled
network.A known method of forming articles from
fluoropolymer resins, such as PTFE, is to blend a
resin with an organic lubricant and compress it under
relatively low pressure into a preformed billet.
Using a ram type extruder, the billet is then
extruded through a die in a desired cross-section.
Next, the lubricant is removed from the extruded
billet by drying or other extraction method. The
dried extruded material (extrudate), is then rapidly
stretched and/or expanded at elevated temperatures.
In the case of PTFE, this results in the material
taking on a microstructure characterized by elongated
nodes interconnected by fibrils. Typically, the
nodes are oriented with their elongated axis
perpendicular to the direction of stretch.After stretching, the porous extrudate is
sintered by heating it to a temperature above its
crystalline melting point while it is maintained in
its stretched condition. This can be considered as
an amorphous locking process for permanently
"locking-in" the microstructure in its expanded or
stretched configuration.It has been found that the effect caused by
stretching PTFE is dependent on extrudate strength,
stretch temperature, and stretch rate. According to 
U.S. patent 3,953,566 of W.L. Gore, products expanded
at high rates
