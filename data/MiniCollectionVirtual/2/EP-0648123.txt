<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of tumours, in 
particular tumours exhibiting an elevated level of pp60c-src 
kinase activity such as human colon carcinoma. The kinase activity of pp60c-src is specifically and 
transiently increased during mitosis and repressed during 
interphase1. Loss of cell cycle control of pp60c-src occurs upon 
mutation of Tyr 527 to Phe or when pp60c-src is associated with 
polyoma middle-T-antigen, and these conditions result in cell 
transformation or tumourigenesis 2,3. In both cases pp60c-src has 
elevated kinase activity which is maintained throughout the 
cell cycle and accompanied by dephosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal 
negative regulatory 4-7 Tyr 527 site, or mimicry of Tyr 
527 dephosphorylation in the case of the mutant. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) have been 
considered as potential anti-oncogenes 8,9, where mutations 
giving rise to a non-functional gene product or gene deletion 
could result in tumourigenesis. We have now found that over-expression 
of the receptor-like human PTPα (HPTPα) results in 
persistent activation of pp60c-src with concomitant cell 
transformation and tumourigenesis. This indicates instead that 
PTPα may function as an oncogene and not an anti-oncogene. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
inhibitor of PTPα for use in the treatment of a tumour 
exhibiting an elevated level of pp60c-src kinase activity. PTPases may be more fully termed as protein tyrosine 
phosphate phosphohydrolases (EC 3.1.3.48). They may be divided 
into three classes based on their structural organisation. 
Class I contains the low molecular mass non-receptor molecules  
 
possessing a single catalytic domain (PTP IB, TCPTP, rat brain 
PTP). Class II and II PTPases are receptor-like transmembrane 
proteins. The sole member of Class II is human PTPβ (HPTPβ) 
which has a single cytoplasmic catalytic domain. Class III 
members are LCA, LAR, HPTPα, HPTPγ, HPTPδ, HPTPε, DPTP, DLAR 
and possess two repeated putative catalytic domains in the 
cytoplasmic region of the molecule. Inhibitors of PTPα include chemical compounds, for 
example zinc ions, vanadates such as sodium orthovanadate and 
arsenites such as phenylarsine oxide. These compounds are, 
however, fairly toxic. Non-toxic inhibitors are preferred. 
The inhibitor may therefore be an antibody, polyclonal or 
monoclonal. The antibody is typically an inhibitory antibody 
to the extracellular domain of PTPα or to the active site in 
the catalytic domain of PTPα. Inhibitors such
