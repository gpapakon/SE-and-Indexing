<ABSTRACT>
A tunnel freezer (1) is cooled by selectively 
supplying liquid nitrogen to banks (5,6,7) of spray 

nozzles. The banks (5,6,7) are switched on and off as 
required so that at any given time the pressure upstream 

of each operational spray nozzle will be substantially 
constant at a level which closely approximates the 

maximum heat transfer coefficient associated with the 
spray nozzle or the maximum effectiveness of the spray 

nozzle or a balance therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for
freezing.In conventional freezing tunnels liquid nitrogen is
admitted to the freezing tunnel through a plurality of
spray nozzles. The flow of liquid nitrogen to the spray
nozzles is continuously varied by a flow control valve
in response to the difference in temperature at a point
in the freezing tunnel and a set temperature. In a
typical installation, after initial cooldown, the flow
through each spray nozzle is varied from 0 1/s to 1.4 x
10-2 l/s which corresponds to a pressure immediately upstream
of the spray nozzle (i.e. downstream of the flow
control valve) of from 0 to 1 bar (gauge).We have discovered that the heat transfer coefficient
for any given spray nozzle varies with the flow
through the spray nozzle and that, in many cases, the
heat transfer coefficient is particularly high over a
very narrow range of flow. Since flow is a function of
the pressure applied upstream of the spray nozzle it
therefore follows that the heat transfer coefficient for
any given spray nozzles varies with the pressure immediately
upstream of the spray nozzle. In addition, we
have discovered that the effectiveness of any given
spray nozzle also varies with the pressure immediately
upstream of the spray nozzle.In general, the higher the heat transfer coefficient
the quicker a product will be frozen. Similarly,
the higher the effectiveness the greater will be the
proportion of the available refrigeration which will be
applied to the product to be frozen.The present invention is based on the concept of
rather than infinitely varying the flow rate through a
spray nozzle, and thus the pressure immediately upstream
of the spray nozzle (such as disclosed in US-A-4 350 
027), one should effect cooling by maintaining the
pressure immediately upstream of the spray nozzle substantially
constant while it is in use, and switching it
on and off as required.According to one aspect of the present invention
there is provided a method of freezing using a freezing
apparatus which comprises at least one bank of spray
nozzles each comprising at least one spray nozzle connectable
to a source of cryogen, an ON/OFF valve for
allowing or preventing cryogen flowing from said source
to said at least one bank, and means for actuating said
ON/OFF valve in response to the heat load on said apparatus,
which method comprises the steps of connecting
said at least one bank of spray nozzles each comprising
at least one spray nozzle to a source of cryogen and
selectively connecting said at least one
