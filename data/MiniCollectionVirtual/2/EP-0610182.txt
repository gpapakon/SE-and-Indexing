<ABSTRACT>
A diving mask comprising: a supporting member (12) arranged for sealing engagement with the face of the user; a lens (10) means mounted in said supporting member (12), said supporting member (12) being dimensioned, so that the lens means (10) is positioned near the eyes of the user with a portion of the nose extending forwardly of the lens means (10) to provide a low profile, low internal volume mask; and said lens means (10) being substantially spherical in configuration and having a single centre of curvature, whereby the apparent magnification of images underwater is less than that observed through a conventional lens plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to underwater vision devices, 
diving masks, and, more particularly, to a diving mask lens 
which permits underwater vision that is virtually the same or 
closely similar to the distortionless, natural perspective, and 
widely peripheral vision that is normally experienced in air. Prior art attempts to make diving masks are well 
represented in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,055,256 issued September 25, 
1962 to John H. Andreson, Jr., 3,672,750 issued June 27, 1972 to 
Kenneth G. Hagen, 3,320,018 issued May 16, 1967 to Max H. Pepke, 
and 2,928,097 issued March 15, 1960 to Lester Neufeld. The Andreson '256 patent discloses a mask for divers 
with imperfect vision which includes a conventional large volume 
type mask frame in which is mounted a conventionally aligned 
spherical lens, denoting a single radius of curvature throughout 
the entire lens, and designed with the primary purpose of 
correcting myopia (near-sightedness). The Hagen '750 patent discloses a diving mask with 
curved lenses, each eye having its own independent lens with a 
centre of curvature for each lens at the eyeball of the user. 
To achieve this, the Hagen mask would have to be custom 
configured for each category of user to locate the specific eye 
points (eg. optical centres and eye depth) properly, a simple 
universally acceptable mask therefore cannot be made according 
to the teachings of Hagen. Further, it has been found that only 
slight shifting of the Hagen-type mask on the user's face 
distorts one's vision to such an extent that nausea may result. 
For this reason, then, such a diving mask is fundamentally 
unacceptable. In one of Hagen's embodiments, each of the dual 
lenses can be made specifically to afford myopia correction with 
the addition of a non-continuous secondary lens system joined to  
 
a portion of each of the main dual lenses, thereby supplying a 
total of four lens systems comprised of two lens systems for 
each eye referred to by Hagen as a corrective lens plus an outer 
lens for each eye. Further, the juncture between each of such 
corrective lenses and its corresponding outer lens is specified 
by Hagen as being abrupt with no blending, that is, the curving 
being non-continuous and not smooth, which would in actual fact 
break up and distort the underwater image unnaturally. The 
applicant notes a further deficiency in this embodiment of the 
Hagen mask in the fact that, except in cases where a user's left 
and right eye correction prescriptions happened to be exactly 
the game, the user

An underwater vision device for reducing distortion, 
comprising: 


a supporting member (12) arranged for providing a water-tight 
seal; 
a lens means (10) mounted in said supporting member, said lens 
means having a central major portion and having an optical 

surface extending across and beyond said central major portion; 
said optical surface being continuously smoothly curved; 
 
characterised by multiple radii of curvature being incorporated 

on said optical surface such that radius of curvature of said 
optical surface changes progressively with increasing distance 

from one or more points on said optical surface. 
The underwater vision device of claim 1 wherein the radius 
of curvature decreases progressively with increasing distance 

away from one or more predetermined central points on said 
optical surface in order to reduce overall lens distortion 

whereby apparent magnification of images underwater is less than 
that observed through a conventional flat lens plate. 
The underwater vision device of claim 1 wherein the radius 
of curvature increases progressively with increasing distance 

away from one or more predetermined central points on said 
optical surface in order to reduce overall lens distortion. 
The underwater vision device of claim 2 wherein said optical 
surface comprises a section from an ellipsoidal surface 

generated from an ellipse, said optical surface centred about 
the short elliptical axis of said ellipse whereby the radius of 

curvature of said optical surface decreases progressively with  
 

increasing distance away from the point on said optical surface 
represented by the intersection of said elliptical axis with 

said optical surface. 
The underwater vision device of claim 3 wherein said optical 
surface comprises a section from an ellipsoidal surface 

generated from an ellipse, said optical surface centred about 
the long elliptical axis of said ellipse whereby the radius of 

curvature of said optical surface increases progressively with 
increasing distance away from the point on said optical surface 

represented by the intersection of said elliptical axis with 
said optical surface. 
The underwater vision device of claim 3 wherein said lens 
means comprises a section from a paraboloidal surface, said 

optical surface centred about the axis of said paraboloidal 
surface whereby the radius of curavature of said optical surface 

increases progressively with increasing distance away from the 
point on said optical surface represented by the intersection of 

said axis with said optical surface. 
The underwater vision device of claim 2 wherein said 
supporting member (12) is arranged for sealing engagement with 

the face of a user such that said underwater vision device is 
adapted for use as a diving mask. 
The underwater vision device of claim 7 wherein said lens 
means comprises two lenses, one covering each eye of a user. 
The underwater vision device of claim 7 wherein said lens 
means comprises a single lens covering both eyes of a user.
