<ABSTRACT>
A tie, particularly for tying a plant 30 to a post 31, 
comprises elongate straps 82,83 for looping around the plant 

and post respectively. Each loop can be tightened to a tension 
independent of the tension to which the other loop is 

tightened, so that strangulation of the plant can be avoided. 
Preferably the straps extend from a body portion 80 which can 

be positioned between the plant and post to prevent the plant 
rubbing against the post.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tie, and more particularly
but not solely to a tie for tying a tree to a post.It is known to support young trees and other plants by
tying them to posts so as to keep them upright and prevent them
from breaking during adverse weather conditions. The plants
may be tied to the posts using twine or plant ties. One such
plant tie comprises an elongate plastics strap having a buckle
at one end. In use, the strap is looped around the tree and
post and its ends fastened together. If the strap is tied too
tight, the plant will be strangled and prevented from growing.
However, if the strap is tied too loosely, the plant can move
and may become damaged by rubbing against the post.DE-U-1-852-268 discloses a tie which alleviates some of
the above-mentioned problems comprising an elongate strap
formable into first and second side-by-side loops, and
fastening means arranged for locking the loops, the arrangement
enabling the second loop to be tightened to a tension
independent of the tension to which the first loop is
tightened.In use as a plant tie, the first loop is formed around
a supporting post to be supported and the second loop is formed
around a plant to be supported. The loop formed around the
plant can be tightened to a higher tension than the loop formed
around the post. Thus the plant can be held securely to the
post without being strangled.In accordance with this invention, there is provided a
tie of the above-mentioned type which is characterised in that
said fastening means is arranged for locking the loops
independently of each other, the arrangement further enabling
the first loop to be tightened to a tension independent of the
tension to which the second loop is tightened.Preferably the tie comprises a body portion from which
the strap or straps extend, and arranged for positioning
between the plant and post (or other two members about which,
in use, the two loops are formed). The body portion therefore
serves to space the plant and post apart to prevent the plant
from rubbing against the post. Preferably at least the strap to be looped around the
plant is formed with a series of perforations along its length,
to enhance it ability to stretch: the plant is therefore able
to grow without being strangled by the loop of the strap which
is tied around it.The tie may comprise first and second straps which both
extend from a first end of the body portion and which are each
formed with a series of perforations along their lengths, and
the body portion being formed with a pair of

<CLAIMS>
A tie comprising one or more elongate straps (82, 83)
formable into first and second side-by-side loops,

and fastening means arranged for locking the loops, the
arrangement enabling said second loop to be tightened to a

tension independent of the tension to which the first loop is
tightened, 
characterised in that
 said fastening means (86,87)
is arranged for locking the loops independently of each other,

the arrangement further enabling the first loop to be tightened
to a tension independent of the tension to which the second

loop is tightened.
A tie as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
strap or straps (82, 83) extend from a body portion (80), the

body portion (80) being arranged for positioning between two
members (30,31) about which, in use, the two loops are formed.
A tie as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that

first and second said straps (82, 83) are provided which both
extend from a first end of said body portion (80) and which are

both formed with a series of perforations along their lengths,
said body portion (80) being formed with a through-passage, or

a pair of through-passages (84, 85), between its said first end
and its opposite end, and being arranged so that each strap

(82, 83) can be formed into said first or second loops
respectively and then passed through said passage, or a

respective said passage (84, 85), from said opposite end to
said first end, said fastening means comprising a pair of

projections (86, 87) on said body portion (80), arranged to
engage with selective perforations of said first and second

strap (82, 83) respectively.
A tie as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that
 each
said fastening means comprises a projection (86,87) in the form

of a hook-shaped catch on said first end of the body portion
(80). 
A tie as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised
in that
 the tie is a one-piece moulding of elastomeric plastics
material.
