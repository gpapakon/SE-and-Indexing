<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates 
to a numeric controller which 

effects movement of a next block 
without interrupting the movement 

of a work, etc, even when a skip 
signal is inputted, and thus reduces 

a cycle time. First, skip signal 
detection means (1b), in response 

to a skip signal SS outputted 
from detection means (2), stores 

a present position (1aa) of a work 

(4) in memory means (1a), and 
outputs a skip completion signal 

AS. Next, acceleration/deceleration 
distribution means (1c) effects 

pulse interpolation of a present 
block, and outputs a distribution 

completion signal ES after the 
movement is completed. Receiving 

this skip completion signal AS, 
pre-treatment distribution means 

(1d) determines a moving distance 
of the next block from the present 

position (1aa) of the work (4), 
and conducts pre-treatment of 

the next block of the machining 
program (1ac). The means 

(1d) receives the distribution 
completion signal ES outputted 

from the acceleration/deceleration 
distribution means (1c), outputs 

the interpolation pulse IP2, and 
moves the work (4) without an 

interruption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical 
control apparatus provided with a skip function, and more 
specifically, to a numerical control apparatus for 
measuring a tool length and a workpiece configuration. In general, numerical control apparatuses are 
provided with a skip function for measuring a tool length 
and a workpiece configuration. The skip function is 
arranged such that when a skip signal is input from the 
outside by a contact type or non-contact type sensor having 
sensed the existence a workpiece and a tool (hereinafter, 
referred to as "a workpiece and the like"), the numerical 
control apparatus stops an axis movement corresponding to 
the block of a machining program which is being executed 
at present and goes to a next block of the machining 
program (hereinafter, simply referred to as "a next block"). Consequently, when an amount of movement is not 
known because a cutting depth or the like is not given in 
grinding machines, lathes and the like, the amount of 
movement can be measured by making effective use of the 
skip function. Nevertheless, when a conventional numerical  
 
control apparatus provided with the skip function is 
supplied with a skip signal from the outside, since the 
numerical control apparatus temporarily stops the movement 
of a workpiece and the like and then executes the movement 
command of a next block, a considerable period of time is 
needed to reach a feed speed for the movement of the next 
block. Thus, a problem arises in that a cycle time is 
increased. JP-A-4-260105 discloses a motion controller for a NC 
device which executes a command for the movement of a next block without temporarily stopping the movement of a workpiece or the like even if a skip signal is input. Taking the above into consideration, an object of the 
present invention is to provide an alternative numerical control 
apparatus which executes a command for the movement of a 
next block without temporarily stopping the movement of a 
workpiece and the like even if a skip signal is input so as 
to reduce a cycle time. To solve the above problem, according to the present 
invention, there is provided a numerical control apparatus 
for measuring a tool length and a workpiece configuration 
by a skip function, the apparatus characterised by: 
memory means for storing a time constant used when a 
feed speed of a workpiece or the like is accelerated or 
decelerated and a machining program; skip signal sensing means for storing the present 
position of said workpiece or the like in a
