<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (1) for a machine for brewing drinks to heat and emulsify liquids, especially for the making of the milk-coffee drink "Cappuccino". The device (1) has a tube (2) with a nozzle (22) which adjoins the bore (10) in the lower section (5) and from whose outlet opening (24) superheated steam emerges, during operation. A nozzle (22) is surrounded by the tube (2) in such a way that an annular chamber (26) open in the flow direction (Y) results around it. The open end (18) of the annular chamber (26) extends beyond the outlet opening (24) of the nozzle (22). Formed on the tube (2) at the height of the outlet opening (24) of the nozzle (22) are passages (29) through which the air required for emulsification can penetrate into the annular chamber (26). Furthermore, means (30) are attached to the tube (2) which make it possible for the user to maintain a certain distance (L) between the outlet opening (24) of the nozzle (22) and the surface (43) of the liquid by visual inspection (40). By means of this device according to the invention, the handling during the milk frothing-up process is considerably simplified in that, with the aid of the visual inspection (40) via an operator, the distance (L) of the outlet opening (24) of the nozzle (22) from the surface (43) of the milk can easily be kept constant. As a result, for a simple design of the device (1) a good froth result is achieved and the frothing-up process is even accelerated.

A device for a beverage brewing machine for the heating 
and emulsification of liquids, in particular for the 

preparation of the coffee with milk beverage "Cappuccino", 
comprising a pipe (2) and a subsequent nozzle (22), from 

the orifice (24) of which nozzle hot steam exits, the 
latter steam mixing with the ambient air, and the so 

produced steam-and-air mixture penetrating into the milk 
and frothing it when the orifice (24) of the nozzle (22) 

is maintained at a small distance from the surface (40) of 
the liquid,
characterized
 in that the nozzle (22) is 
encompassed by the pipe (2) such that around it an annular 

chamber (26) is formed, which is open only in the 
direction of flow (Y), the open end (18) of the annular 

chamber extending beyond the orifice (24) of the nozzle 
(22), in that a
pertures (29) are formed at the pipe (2) at 
the level of the orifice (24) of the nozzle (22) through 

which the air, which is necessary for the emulsification, 
can enter the annular chamber (26), and in that a means 

(30) is fitted to the pipe (2) which permits a user 
maintaining a defined distance (L) between the orifice 

(24) of the nozzle (22) and the liquid's surface (43) by 
visual check (31, 40). 
A device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the apertures (29) are 
formed by slots which extend up to the open end (18) of 

the pipe (2). 
A device as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the slots (29) extend 
alongside the axis (17) of the pipe (2) and are arranged 

so as to spread over its periphery, and in that radially 
outwardly extending ribs (30) are provided between the  

 
slots (29) at the pipe (2), the end faces (31) of which 

ribs form the means for the visual check (40). 
A device as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the ribs (30) extend up 
to the open end (18) of the pipe (2), and in that their 

respective end faces (31) form the visual check means (31, 
40) by ending flush with the front side (25) provided at 

the open end (18) of the pipe (2). 
A device as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the radially outward 
outside surface (33) of the ribs (30) expands from the 

pipe (2) towards the open end (18). 
A device as claimed in claim 5,
characterized
 in that the ribs (30) have the 
shape of a square triangle, one cathedus (31) thereof 

forming the end face of the ribs (30) in each case. 
A device as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the ribs (30) end above 
the slots (29) at the pipe (2). 
A device as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that at least three, 
preferably five, slots (29) and, correspondingly, at least 

three, preferably five, ribs (30) are provided at the pipe 
(2). 
A device as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the apertures (29) have 
a cross-section of 50 mm
2
 in total, in that the diameter 
(d) of the nozzle (22) amounts to 1 mm approximately, and 

the distance (L) of the orifice (24) of the nozzle (22) 
from the front side (25) of the pipe (2) amounts to 3 mm 

approximately.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 9,
characterized
 in that the nozzle (22) expands 
conically from roughly 1 mm to roughly 4.8 mm in diameter 

via a step (19) from the orifice (24) in opposition to the 
direction of flow (Y). 
A device as claimed in claim 10,
characterized
 in that the annular chamber 
(26) has a bottom (28) which extends roughly at the level 

of the step (19). 
A device as claimed in claim 9,
characterized
 in that the diameter (D) of the 
annular chamber (26) amounts to 7 to 8 mm approximately. 
A device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the pipe (2) forms the 
extension of the steam pipe (45). 
A device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that, at the end opposite to 
the nozzle (22), a coupling arrangement is provided at the 

pipe (2) which permits coupling to a steam pipe (45)

A device as claimed in claim 14,
characterized
 in that the coupling 
arrangement is a clip-on connect. 
A device as claimed in claim 14,
