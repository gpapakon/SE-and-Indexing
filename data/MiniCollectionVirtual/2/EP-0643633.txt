<ABSTRACT>
Method for joining together two or several overlying sheet formed members (1, 2), at which an essentially coaxial arrangement of a punch (4), a die (3), with a die cavity (9), and an anvil (5) are caused to cooperate by means of their coaxial relative movements, comprising the following steps: (a) said overlaying sheet formed members (1, 2) are placed between the punch (4) and the die (3); (b) said punch (4) is caused to carry out a first relative movement in a first direction coaxially towards said die (3); (c) an essentially cylindrical core portion (6) of the punch (4) is caused to coact with the die cavity (9) to form during the movement in the direction of the die cavity (9) by means of drawing of said sheet formed members (1, 2), a cup-shaped or protruding portion (10) having a side wall portion and a bottom wall portion (12); (d) said anvil (5) is caused to carry out a movement relative to said die in a second direction and is caused to be locked in a predetermined position relative to the die; (e) said punch (4) is caused to carry out a second relative movement in said first direction coaxially towards said die (3), and by means of forces between said punch (4) and said anvil (5) compress said bottom wall portion whereby there is formed a laterally enlarged shape which mechanically interlocks the sheet formed members (1, 2) and whereby said punch is provided, around the rear end of said core portion (6), with a lateral extension (8) which during said step c is caused to deform and displace material from the area around the opening (11) of the cup-shaped or protruding portion (10) mainly in the upper sheet formed member (1) axially in the direction of the die (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for joining together two 
or several overlaying sheet formed members, an apparatus for 
carrying out said method and a joint resulting from said 
method. Such joining procedures could e.g. be carried out by 
first drawing and then laterally extruding the material of 
the two sheet formed members to be joined into an enlarged 
shape which will interlock the members. A joint produced by 
means of this method will typically be of the leakproof type. 
The members could also be joined by lancing and forming a 
part of one member through an unblanked part of the other 
member and thereafter staking the lanced and formed part of 
the one member to an adjacent surface of the other member to 
secure the members together in overlaying relation. A joint 
produced by means of this method will typically be of the 
non-leakproof type. Methods and apparatuses for joining sheet formed members 
together, thereby producing leakproof or non-leakproof 
joints, are previously known. Of particular interest in some 
applications is a type of leakproof joint which is made by 
means of drawing said sheet formed members into a cup-shaped 
or protruding portion having a cylindrical or slightly 
conical side wall and a bottom wall and subsequently 
compressing said bottom wall creating a lateral extrusion of 
the same thereby forming a laterally enlarged shape which  
 
mechanically interlocks the sheet formed members. US-A-4 459 735 (nearest state of the art) discloses an apparatus, a method and a joint 
of this type. The method is of the single stroke type which 
means that the whole procedure takes place during one single 
relative movement between a punch and a coacting die. For the 
compression of the bottom wall of the cup-shaped portion an 
anvil is arranged fixed at the bottom of the die cavity which 
cavity is laterally expandable. Double-stroke methods are also known from e.g. WO 89/07020 
according to which the compression takes place during a 
second stroke outside the die cavity. This cavity is 
generally laterally non-expandable. One problem with the leakproof joints of the above type is 
the relatively low resistance against so called shear and 
peeling forces. It turns out that the drawing depth into the die cavity and 
the gap between the punch and the die cavity are critical 
parameters. If the drawing depth is too big and/or the gap between the 
punch and the die cavity is too small the side wall of the 
cup-formed or protruding portion, especially on the sheet 
formed member
