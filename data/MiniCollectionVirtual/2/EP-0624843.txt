<ABSTRACT>
The electrical device consists of a central unit (1) and secondary units (2) which can be addressed from the central unit (1) by means of secondary-unit-specific addresses via a communication system (3). According to the invention, addressing errors which are caused by faulty secondary units (2) can be detected by the fact that   - an identification is transferred from the addressed secondary unit (2) to the central unit (1) at least in some of the accesses of the central unit (1) to one of the secondary units (2), - that the identification transferred to the central unit (1) is compared with a nominal identification, and - that addressing errors are detected when the identification transferred deviates from the nominal identification.

Method for detecting addressing errors for an 
electrical device, which comprises a central unit (1) 

and secondary units (2) which can be addressed by the 
central unit (1) by way of a communication system (3) 

by means of addresses specific to secondary units, 
whereby each secondary unit (2) has a memory element 

(8) which can be written and read by the central unit 
(1), characterized by the following steps: 


first of all a first identifier is stored in the 
memory elements (8) of the secondary units (2), 
then in a certain sequence the content of each of 
the memory elements (8) of the secondary units (2) 

is read, the actual identifier determined in this 
way is compared with the previously stored first 

identifier, and a second identifier different to 
the first identifier is written into this memory 

element (8), 
finally addressing errors are detected as soon as 
one of the actual identifiers which are determined 

in this way differs from the previously stored 
first identifier. 
Method for detecting addressing errors 
according to claim 1, characterized in that after the 

content of each of the memory elements (8) of the 
secondary units (2) has been read and after the second 

identifier has been written into the memory elements 
(8) 


in a sequence opposite to the determined sequence 
the content of each of the memory elements (8) is 

read, the actual identifier determined in this way 
is compared with the previously stored second 

identifier and a third identifier different to the 
second identifier is written into this memory 

element (8) and 
addressing errors are detected as soon as one of  
 

the actual identifiers which are determined in 
this way differs from the second identifier. 
Method for detecting addressing errors 
according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 

first identifier and/or the second identifier are 
identical (2) for all secondary units. 
Method for detecting addressing errors 
according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the 

third identifier is identical to the first identifier. 
Method for detecting addressing errors 
according to one of the above claims, characterized in 

that it is used in automation systems, in particular in 
redundant automation systems.
