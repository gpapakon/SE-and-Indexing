<ABSTRACT>
To prepare 2-cyanoacetoxypropionic acid esters, a mixture of lactic acid and cyanoacetic acid esters is taken, an alkali metal alkoxide is added as a catalyst and the mixture is heated until the resulting alcohol distils off. The course of the reaction is monitored by means of gas-chromatographic analysis and the reaction is terminated when the maximum content of target product is almost reached. If necessary, the course of the reaction is determined in a small preliminary test. After discontinuation of the reaction, the catalyst is destroyed by acidifying and the reaction mixture is worked up by distillation.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of 2-cyanoacetoxy-propionic 
esters of the general formula III 


 
characterized in that cyanoacetic esters of the general 

formula I are reacted with lactic esters of the general 
formula II 


 
in which R denotes a C
1
-C
10
-hydrocarbon radical and 1 to 20 
mol of cyanoacetic esters are used per mol of the lactic 

ester, in the presence of 0.001 to 0.1 mol of a basic 
catalyst per mol of lactic ester at 100 to 230°C, the 

corresponding alcohol being distilled off, and the reaction 
is terminated before achieving the theoretically possible 

amount of alcohol at a lactic ester conversion of 76 to 85% 
by destroying the catalyst and rendering it ineffective. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that reaction temperatures of 140 to 200°C are chosen. 
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that 1 to 10 and preferably 1.1 to 2 mol of 

cyanoacetic ester are used per mol of lactic ester. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that alcoholates of alkali metals or of 

alkaline earth metals, preferably of Na, K, Mg, Sr or Ba, 
and, as alcohols, of C
1
- to C
10
- straight-chain or branched  
 

alkanols, preferably sodium methylate, ethylate or butylates 
or potassium methylate, ethylate or butylates, are used as 

catalysts. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that 0.005 to 0.05, in particular 0.01 to 

0.05, mol of catalyst is used per mol of lactic ester.
