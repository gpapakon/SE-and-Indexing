<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a curable 
organopolysiloxane composition that forms cured release 
coatings that exhibit excellent release properties 
relative to silicone-based tacky substances. Poducts capable of releasing tacky substances 
(e.g., pressure-sensitive adhesives) can be prepared by 
forming a cured release coating on the surface of many 
different types of substrates, such as paper, plastic 
films, and synthetic fiber fabrics. Organopolysiloxane 
compositions are typically used to form these cured 
release coatings, for example, JP- A 63-48901, and 
63-320. The cured films obtained from the 
aforementioned organopolysiloxane compositions do in 
fact exhibit excellent release properties with respect 
to tacky substances based on ordinary organic resins. 
However, they exhibit poor release properties when 
challenged by silicone-based tacky materials, 
whose main component is also organopolysiloxane. As a 
consequence, the compositions of these publications are 
not completely satisfactory for some applications. EP-A-0 487 079 discloses fluorine-containing polyorganosiloxane compositions comprising trifluorochloroethylene resin. We have found that an organopolysiloxane 
composition containing a specific type of organic resin 
yields a cured coating that exhibits excellent release 
properties relative to silicone-based pressure-sensitive 
adhesives. The invention was based on this 
finding. Our invention introduces an 
organopolysiloxane composition which cures into a 
release coating that exhibits excellent release 
properties with respect to various types of tacky 
substances and particularly silicone-based tacky 
substances.  
 The invention therefore provides to a curable 
organopolysiloxane composition that is composed of 
(A) 100 weight parts of an organopolysiloxane that 
contains at least 1 fluorinated organic group and 
at least 2 alkenyl groups in each molecule; (B) 0.3 to 40 weight parts of an 
organohydrogenpolysiloxane that contains at least 
2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule; (C) 0.1 to 20 weight parts of a fluorine-containing 
acrylic polymer; (D) a catalytic quantity of a hydrosilylation 
catalyst; and  
and 
(E) an organic solvent Component (A) is the base component of the 
composition of the present invention. Each molecule of 
this organopolysiloxane must contain at least 1 
fluorinated organic group and at least 2 alkenyl 
groups. The fluorinated organic group is exemplified 
by groups with the general formula CnF2n+1-R-, wherein n 
is 1 to 20, R denotes an
