<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for use in a network providing 
security to ensure the prevention of unauthorized receipt 

of data. The system utilizes a jamming sequence to 
prevent unauthorized ports from receiving certain data. 

Repeaters utilized in the network are provided with the 
capability to detect a particular data sequence to 

provide the improved features.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to secure 
communication within a local area network such as 
disrupting data that is received by ports 
of a repeater in such a network. In traditional Ethernet (802.3 10BASE5) and 
Cheapernet (802.3 10BASE2) a coaxial cable provides the 
linear bus to which all nodes are connected. Signalling 
is accomplished using a current synch technique with a 
center conductor used for the signal and a shield used as 
a ground reference. Twisted pair Ethernet (802.3 10BASE-T) 
utilizes standard voice grade telephone cable, 
employing separate transmit and receive pairs. The 
system uses a star topology. At the center of a star is 
a repeater. The repeater performs signal amplitude and 
timing restoration. It takes the incoming bitstream and 
repeats it to all the ports connected to it. In this 
sense the repeater acts as a logical coaxial cable so 
that any node connected to the network will see another 
node's transmission. Differential signalling is employed 
with one pair acting as the transmit path and the other 
pair acting as the receive path. While repeaters are used in traditionally wired 
coaxial Ethernet as a means to extend the networks 
physical distance limit, in the IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T, the  
 
standard mandates the use of a repeater to actually 
provide the connectivity function if more than two nodes 
are required. Although the physical signalling on the 
cabling differs, the functionality of the repeater is 
identical in either coaxial or twisted pair networks as 
is the frame or packet format that is used to pass 
messages between the participating nodes on the network. The frame commences with a preamble sequence which 
is an alternating (1,0) pattern. The preamble provides a 
single frequency on the network, in this case 5 (MHz) at 
the start of each frame, which allows a receiver to lock 
to the incoming bitstream. This preamble sequence is 
then followed by a start of packet which indicates that 
the data portion of the message will follow. Either a 
start of frame delimiter (802.3) or synch sequence 
(Ethernet) is used to delineate the start of the data 
portion of the message. The next two fields are the 
destination address (DA) and the source address (SA) for 
the frame. Both are 48 bit values which are transmitted 
least significant bit (LSB) first. The destination address is used by the receiving 
media access controller (MAC) to determine if the 
incoming packet is addressed to this particular node. If 
the receiving node detects a match between

<CLAIMS>
A system for providing security for a network 
that includes a plurality of ports for transmitting and 

receiving data, the data including a bit that indicates 
the start of a data stream and a bit corresponding to 

each port that is to receive the data the system 
comprising; 

   means for enabling a disrupt functions coupled to 
each of the ports; 

   a plurality of disrupt circuits means coupled to the 
enabling means, there being one disrupt circuit means for 

each port, each of the disrupt means being coupled in a 
serial fashion; 

   a detect circuit coupled between a first disrupt 
circuit means and a last disrupt circuit means to detect 

when the start bit has reached to last disrupt circuit 
means; and 

   means for providing a jam sequence of data that will 
block a data bitstream from reaching a particular port 

responsive to the detect circuit means. 
The system of claim 1 in which each of the 
disrupt circuit means includes a shift register, each of 

the shift registers being chained in a serial manner. 
The system of claim 2 in which each of the 
disrupt circuit means includes a latch for receiving a 

bit of from the data bitstream which provides an 
 

indication of whether the data provided to a particular 
port should be disrupted. 
The system of claim 3 in which each of the 
latches correspond to each of the ports. 
The system of claim 4 in which the detect 
circuit means comprises; 

   means for detecting a start bit; 
   means coupled to the detecting means for determining 

whether the start bit has reached to one bit shift 
register; and 

   means responsive to the start bit reaching the last 
one bit shift register for asserting a signal that 

latches bits from the plurality of one bit shift register 
to the latch to indicate whether a port should be 

disrupted. 
The system of claim 5 in which the asserting 
means provides a strobe signal to the one bit shift 

registers that latches the data into the latches.
