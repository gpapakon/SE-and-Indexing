<DESCRIPTION>
 BENZODIAZEPINE DERIVATIVESThis invention relates to benzodiazepine compounds which are useful as antagonists of cholecystokinin and gastrin receptors.Cholecystokinins (CCK) and gastrin are structurally related peptides which exist in gastrointestinal tissue and in the central nervous system (see, V. Mutt, Gastrointestinal Hormones, G.B.J. Green, Ed., Raven Press, N.Y., p.169 and G. Nission, ibid. p.127) .Cholecystokinins include CCK-33, a neuropeptide of thirty-three amino acids in its originally isolated form (see, Mutt and Jorpes, Biochem. J. 125. 678 (1971)), its carboxylterminal octapeptide, CCK-8 (also a naturally-occurring neuropeptide and the minimum fully active sequence) , and 39- and 12-amino acid forms. Gastrin occurs in 34-, 17- and 14-amino acid forms, with the minimum active sequence being the C-terminal tetrapeptide, Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2, which is the common structural element shared by both CCK and gastrin.CCKs are believed to be physiological satiety hormones, thereby possibly playing an important role in appetite regulation (G. P. Smith, Eating and ItsDisorders. A. J. Stunkard and E. Stellar, Eds, Raven Press, New York, 1984, p. 67), as well as stimulating colonic motility, gall bladder contraction, pancreatic enzyme secretion and inhibiting gastric emptying. They reportedly co-exist with dopamine in certain mid-brain neurons and thus may also play a role in the functioning of dopaminergic systems in the brain, in addition to serving as neurotransmitters in their own right (see A. J. Prange et al.. "Peptides in the Central Nervous 

System", Ann. Repts. Med. Chem 17. 31, 33 [1982] and references cited therein; J. A. Williams, Biomed Res. 3 107 [1982]; and J.E. Morley, Life Sci. 30. 479 [1982]).The primary role of gastrin, on the other hand, appears to be stimulation of the secretion of water and electrolytes from the stomach and, as such, is involved in control of gastric acid and pepsin secretion. Other physiological effects of gastrin then include increased mucosal blood flow and increased antral motility. Rat studies have shown that gastrin has a positive trophic effect on the gastric mucosa, as evidenced by increased DNA, RNA and protein synthesis.There are at least two subtypes of cholecystokinin receptors termed CCK-A and CCK-B (T.H. Moran et al. , "Two brain cholecystokinin receptors: implications for behavioural actions", Brain Res.. 362. 175-79 [1986]). Both subtypes are found both in the periphery and in the central nervous system.CCK and gastrin receptor antagonists have
