<ABSTRACT>
A vial access pin includes opposed proximal and distal ends. The proximal 
end of the vial access pin is configured for mounting to a hypodermic syringe. The 

distal end of the vial access pin defines a cannula. The cannula includes a sharp 
point for piercing an elastomeric seal of a vial. A lumen extends through the cannula 

and communicates with the proximal end of the pin. A fluid flow aperture extends 
through the cannula at a location spaced from the distal end. The aperture enables a 

vial to be substantially drained without repositioning the cannula relative to the vial. 
An ampule access tube can be mounted over the cannula to cover the aperture and 

enable fluid in an ampule to be accessed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to a pin 
assembly that is mountable on a hypodermic syringe or other fluid delivery device, 
and that enables access to medication in either a glass ampule or in a vial having an 
elastomeric closure. Liquid pharmaceuticals often are stored 
in rigid containers and are accessed by a hypodermic syringe. The typical prior art 
hypodermic syringe includes a syringe barrel with a mounting collar for threadedly 
engaging the hub of a needle cannula. The hub and the needle cannula are connected 
to one another or are maintained separately from the syringe barrel until shortly prior 
to use. In cases where the needle is maintained separately, the medical practitioner 
selects an appropriate prior art needle cannula for the procedure being carried out. 
The prior art needle cannula is removed from its sterile package, and the hub of the 
needle cannula is threadedly engaged with the mounting collar of the syringe barrel. Some containers for liquid pharmaceuticals are plastic or glass vials with an 
elastomeric closure that can be penetrated by the needle of a hypodermic syringe. 
To access the liquid in a vial, the medical practitioner moves the plunger of the 
hypodermic syringe in a proximal direction to draw into the syringe barrel a volume 
of air substantially equal to the volume of medication that is desired. The open distal 
end of the needle is then urged through the elastomeric closure of the vial, and the 
air in the syringe barrel is injected into the vial. The distal tip of the needle and the 
vial engaged therewith are then pointed gravitationally upwardly. The practitioner 
ensures that the distal tip of the prior art needle is covered by the medication in the 
vial by manipulating the needle and the vial with respect to each other. The plunger 
of the hypodermic syringe is then moved proximally to draw the medication through 
the prior art needle and into the chamber of the syringe barrel. The practitioner must continuously watch the plunger and the syringe barrel 
to ensure that the desired amount of medication is being withdrawn. 
Simultaneously, however, the practitioner must watch the vial to be certain that the 
tip of the prior art needle remains covered by the medication. As the volume of 
medication in the vial is depleted, the medical practitioner may have to gradually  
 
withdraw the prior art needle cannula from the vial. It will be appreciated that the 
last portion of medication in the vial often is difficult to extract without inadvertently 
separating

<CLAIMS>
An access pin (12) for use with a hypodermic 
syringe to access fluid in a vial (52) having a resilient 

pierceable seal (68), comprising: an elongate body having 
a proximal end (16) with mounting means (20) for mounting 

said pin directly to a hypodermic syringe, a sharp distal 
end (18) for piercing said seal (68), a cannula portion 

(36) of said body extending proximally from said distal 
end (18) and including a lumen (40) extending axially 

therethrough and communicating with said proximal end 
(16), a fluid flow aperture extending through said 

cannula at a location disposed proximally of said sharp 
distal end (18), said fluid flow aperture (42;82) 

enabling fluid flow into said lumen from locations on 
said cannula proximally of said distal end, a flange (30) 

extending generally radially outwardly from a location 
between a distal end of said mounting means (20) and a 

proximal end of said fluid flow aperture (42;82), said 

flange (30) having an outer circumferential configuration 
for facilitating engagement of said access pin (12) with 

said hypodermic syringe, said flange (30) extending more 
radially outwardly than said mounting means (20),
characterized by
 
an ampule access tube (14) removably mounted in fluid-tight 

engagement over said cannula portion (36) and 
extending from a location proximally of said aperture 

(42;82) to a location distally of said distal end (18) of 
said cannula portion (36) whereby said ampule access tube 

(14) enables access of fluid in an ampule (72) and 
removal of said ampule access tube (14) from said vial 

access pin enables access of fluid in a sealed vial (52).  
 
The access pin of Claim 1, wherein said aperture 
(42) defines a slot extending proximally from said distal 

end (18) of said cannula portion (36) to a location 
intermediate said proximal and distal ends (16,18). 
The access pin of Claim 1, wherein said aperture 
(82) is circularly shaped and positioned intermediate 

said proximal (18) and said distal (16) ends. 
The access pin of Claim 2, wherein said lumen 
(40) defines an inside diameter, and wherein said slot 

(42) defines a width (F) less than said inside diameter 
of said lumen. 
The access pin of Claim 1, wherein said flange 
(30) includes a non-circular outer circumferential 

configuration. 
The access pin of Claim 5, wherein said non-circular 
outer circumferential configuration of said 

flange (30) includes a plurality of concave regions (34) 
for facilitating gripping of said vial access pin (12). 
The access pin of one of Claims 1-6, wherein said 
fluid flow aperture (42;82) includes a proximal end 

positioned distally from said flange (32) a distance 
equal to or greater than the axial thickness of said 

resilient pierceable seal (68) of said vial (52) so that 
when said vial access pin pierces said resilient 

pierceable seal and enters the vial far enough so that 
said fluid flow aperture is within said vial, said flange 

is contacting said vial.
