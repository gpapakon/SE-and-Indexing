<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a direct current electric arc furnace for melting (smelting) down (remelting) metal, in which both electrodes are connected via supply leads to a direct current source (21) and are magnetically separated from the charge at least partially by screening. In order to be able with the use of structurally simple means requiring little outlay on maintenance to influence the direction of burning of the arc, it is proposed to provide at least two supply leads (26,28) to the bottom electrode (25) which have conductor pieces (27, 29) guided parallel to the main axis (l), and to provide between the conductor pieces (27,29) and the upper vessel (12,13) for the purpose of attenuating the magnetic field produced by the current at the level of the arc shields (31,32) which can be displaced parallel to the upper vessel (12,13) with the aid of drives (34) connected to them.

A direct-current arc furnace for smelting metal, 
in particular scrap, with a furnace vessel (10) which 

can be closed by a cover (14), which vessel consists of 
a refractory-lined lower vessel (11) and a metallic 

upper vessel (12, 13) through which coolant flows, and 
with a means for supplying the electric current, 

consisting of an electrode (24) which projects through 
the cover (14) into the furnace vessel (10) and a base 

electrode (25) arranged in the base (15) of the lower 
vessel (11), both electrodes being connected via feed 

lines to a direct-current source (21) and being 
magnetically separated from the charge at least in part 

by shielding, and at least two means (26, 28) for 
supplying current to the base electrode (25) being 

provided, which have parts (27, 29) of lines which are 
guided parallel to the main axis (I),
 
characterised in that
 
shields (31, 32) are provided between the line parts 

(27, 29) and the upper vessel (12, 13) in order to 
weaken the magnetic field produced by the current at 

the level of the arc, which shields can be displaced 
parallel to the upper vessel (12, 13) with the aid of 

drives (34) which are connected thereto. 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the means (34) for displacing the 

shields (31, 32) are piston-cylinder units (35). 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the piston-cylinder units (35) 

are connected to a control unit (41) which are 
connected to current-(42) and/or temperature-measuring 

elements (43) via a control line (44) [sic].  

 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the drives (34) have guide rods 

(33) by means of which the shield (31) can be guided 
paraxially to the electrode (24). 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the drives (34) are electromechanical 

drives (37) which are connected to guide 
rails (36) by means of which the shield (32) can be 

displaced horizontally. 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the upper vessel (12) is made of 

copper at its mouth which is inclined towards the lower 
vessel (11). 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the line parts (27, 29) are 

connected to a pivoting means (50) by means of which 
their distance relative to each other can be changed. 
A direct-current arc furnace according to Claim 7,
 
characterised in that articulations (51, 52) are 

provided in the feed lines (26, 28) for pivoting the 
line parts (27, 28).
