<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to sensors for 
sensing the rotation rate of motor vehicles and other 
objects, and more specifically to a rotation sensor using 
linear accelerometers which senses the rotation of an 
object in a manner which is independent of the location of 
the axis about which the object rotates, the radius of 
rotation and translational movement of the object. Rotation sensors are required to provide inputs to 
advanced mechanical control systems such as four-wheel 
steering, anti-lock braking, electronic shifting, and 
traction control systems for motor vehicles. The parameter 
which is to be sensed is the rotation rate, or angular 
velocity of the vehicle body relative to a fixed frame of 
reference, in this case the earth. Known rotation sensors such as mechanical gyroscopes, 
ring lasers, fiber-optic ring interferometers, and variations 
of liquid-suspended floating rotors are too expensive 
for automotive applications. U.S. Patent No. 5,120,951, entitled "OPTOELECTRONIC 
MOTION AND FLUID FLOW SENSOR WITH RESILIENT MEMBER DEFLECTED 
BY FLUID FLOW", issued June 9, 1992 to J. Small,  
 
discloses a rotation sensor including a light source and a 
photosensor which are disposed on opposite sides of a 
circular fluid passageway. A resilient member is fixedly supported at one end or 
edge and is entrained in the fluid for varying the amount 
of light incident on the photosensor from the light source 
as a function of the amount of deflection of the resilient 
member caused by motion of the fluid in the passageway. This prior art rotation sensor is inexpensive and 
provides good performance in numerous applications. 
However, the fluid is urged to accelerate to and rotate at 
the same speed as the sensor body due to viscous coupling 
between the body and the fluid. This causes the output 
signal of the sensor to decay with time, making it difficult 
to sense slowly changing rotation rates. Linear accelerometers are commercially available at 
low cost, and produce output signals which do not decay 
with time. It is possible to use a linear accelerometer to 
sense angular velocity if the axis and radius of rotation 
are fixed and known, since the centripetal acceleration 
which can be sensed by a linear accelerometer is equal to 
the product of the radius of rotation and the square of the 
angular velocity. However, the axis about which a motor vehicle can 
rotate and the radius of rotation vary widely depending on 
actual driving conditions. The axis will be located at the 
cente
