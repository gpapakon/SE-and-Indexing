<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polysilane type
photosensitive resin composition and a method for forming a
pattern using the same.Recently, a study about a two-layer resist using
polysilane has been made intensively for the purpose of the
development of a resist for forming an ultrafine pattern in high
accuracy. Further, Tsushima et al. has found that a colored
pattern obtained by exposing a polysilane thin film to ultraviolet
light and dipping the exposed thin film in a sol of a metal oxide
containing a dye or a pigment can be applied for a color filter
(U.S. Ser. No. 08/004,613 or EP Patent Appln. No. 93,300,228.9).However, long-time exposure is required for photo-decomposition
of polysilane because of low reaction rate and
low sensitiveness. Accordingly, there is a problem that
productivity is deteriorated.It has hitherto been found to be effective to add
sensitizers (e.g. triazine, etc.) or peroxides to polysilane in
order to improve the sensitiveness of polysilane to
photodegradation (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 61-189533;
G.M. Wallraff et al., Polym. Mat. Sci. Eng., No. 66, page
105 (1992)). However, in these prior arts, exposure time is still
long and it is necessary to add a large amount of the sensitizer 
in order to reduce the exposure time. The large amount of
additives deteriorates physical properties of polysilane itself
and, therefore, it is requested to improve the sensitiveness of
polysilane to photodegradation by formulating additives in the
smallest possible amount.The above conventional problems are solved by the
present invention. That is, one object of the present invention is
to provide a polysilane resin composition wherein the exposure
can be completed in a short period of time.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a method for forming a pattern using the polysilane resin
composition.The present invention provides a photosensitive resin
composition comprising:
(a) a polysilane having a structure of the formula:

[wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4, the same or different, are selected
from the group consisting of a substituted or non-substituted
aliphatic hydrocarbon group, an alicyclic hydrocarbon group and
an aromatic hydrocarbon group, and m and n indicate an integer],(b) a compound with generates a halogen radical by light irradiation, and(c) an oxygen supply source.The present invention also provides a method for
forming a thin film pattern of a metal oxide, which comprises
the steps of:
forming a photosensitive layer composed of the
photosensitive
