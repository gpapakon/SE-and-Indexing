<ABSTRACT>
- Grilling or cooking devices. - The invention relates to a grilling or cooking device comprising a frame, at least one heating plate, heating elements (4), at least one thermal reflector (52) for reflecting the radiation towards the heating plate, and a thermal sensor (1) designed to regulate the temperature of the heating plate by means of an elastically movable arrangement. - In accordance with the invention, the thermal sensor (1) is a thermovariable resistor fitted to the end of a support (100) which comes into contact with the heating plate consisting of a removable cooking plate (82), which support (100) receives a return force in at least one direction from spring means connected to said support (100) in order to subject the thermovariable resistor principally to the direct thermal flux, from the cooking plate (82). - For a meat grilling plate.

A cooking or grilling appliance comprising a structure, at least
one hotplate, heater elements (4), at least one heat reflector (52)

for reflecting, towards the hotplate, infrared radiation emitted by
the heater elements (4) which are distributed between the heat

reflector (52) and the hotplate, and a temperature sensor (1) for
regulating the temperature of said appliance, the sensor being

maintained in the temperature environment of the hotplate by means of
an elastically movable arrangement,

   the appliance being characterized in that:

the structure is made of plastics material; and
a temperature sensor (1) is constituted by a temperature-variable
resistor housed on the end of a support (100) coming into

contact with the hotplate which is constituted by a removable cooking
plate (82), said support (100) being subjected to a return force in

at least one direction by resilient means associated with said
support (100) to subject the temperature-variable resistor mainly to

the direct heat flux from the cooking plate (82).
An appliance according to claim 1, characterized in that the
temperature sensor (1) is disposed in a cavity (101) formed in a

portion of the support (100) facing the cooking plate (82).
An appliance according to claim 1, characterized in that the
temperature sensor (1) is disposed in an inside volume (101a) of a

portion of the support (100) facing the cooking plate (82).
An appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
temperature sensor (1) is in contact with the cooking plate (82).
An appliance according to claim 4, characterized in that the
temperature sensor (1) is in contact with the cooking plate (82) via

an electrically insulating sheath or layer surrounding said
temperature sensor (1).
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the support (100) is a tongue passing through the back (50) of 

the heat reflector (52), said tongue extending at least in part into
the empty space defined between the heat reflector (52) and the

cooking plate (82).
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the support (100) has hook means (102, 102a) designed to secure

the support (100) to flexible or resilient means of the spring or
spring blade (90) type for subjecting said support (100) to a return

force.
An appliance according to any preceding characteristic,
characterized in that the cooking plate (82) has a housing for

receiving and positioning the support (100).
An appliance according to any preceding characteristic,
characterized in that the temperature sensor (1) is associated with

an electronic circuit (30) for regulating and/or monitoring
temperature, and delivering two low-voltage electrical power feeds.
An appliance according to any one of claims 5 to 9, characterized
in that the electrically insulating sheath or layer surrounding the

temperature sensor (1) is made of polytetrafluoroethylene.
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the temperature sensor (1) is constituted by an NTC resistor.
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that it constitutes a meat-griller.
