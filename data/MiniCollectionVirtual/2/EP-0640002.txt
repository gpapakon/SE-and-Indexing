<ABSTRACT>
An air filter comprises an inlet (1) for compressed air; a prefiltration chamber (2) into which air from the inlet passes; a porous filter means (3) through which air from the prefiltration chamber passes, to strain particulate matter from the air; a plurality of venturis (4) through which air from the porous filter means passes; an expansion chamber (5) in which air from the venturis expands and cools so that droplets of oil and water precipitate and accumulate at the bottom of the expansion chamber; and an outlet (6) for air from the expansion chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air filter. It 
relates particularly to an air filter for removing 
particulate matter, water and oil, whether in the form 
of vapour or droplets, from compressed air systems such 
as air braking systems. Hot compressed air has a greater propensity for 
carrying water and oil vapour and suspended water and 
oil droplets and other particles than has non-compressed 
room temperature air. It is therefore frequently 
important for filtering apparatus to be provided for 
removing contaminants from a system which utilizes 
compressed air. Conventional systems for removing contaminants 
have involved cooling by means of an air cooler which 
encourages precipitation of water and oil vapours, 
followed by passage through a porous filter medium which 
removes suspended water and oil droplets and other 
foreign particles. However, the air coolers used in 
such systems have generally been large and expensive, 
and the porous filter medium has generally become 
blocked in a short period of time so that frequent 
maintenance or replacement has been required. Over the past few years, more efficient means of 
removing vapours from compressed air have been 
developed. Examples of these new types of humidity 
removers are given in U.S. Patent 4,662,907, 
International Publication No. WO88/02658 and U.S. Patent 
4,848,988. Each of these specifications describes a 
device having an inner cylinder completely encompassed 
within an outer cylinder. Compressed air is injected 
through flared nozzles located near the top of the inner 
cylinder, and the inner cylinder functions as an 
expansion chamber in which the air expands rapidly and 
so cools adiabatically. Cooling results in 
precipitation of vapours, and the devices described in 
U.S. Patent 4,662,907 and International Publication No. 
WO88/02658 provide filter nets across the inner chamber  
 
to trap droplets so precipitated. The device disclosed 
in U.S. Patent 4,848,988 relies on a baffle plate to 
trap precipitated droplets. The water and oil then 
flows down the sides of the inner chamber and 
accumulates at the bottom of the outer chamber, from 
which it may be removed by an outlet port. The dried 
air passes from the bottom of the inner chamber into the 
outer chamber and out through an outlet port at the top 
of the outer cylinder. While these types of filters are effective in 
removing oil and water from compressed air, it has been 
found that after a short period of use the flared 
injection nozzles located at the top of the inner
