<ABSTRACT>
A wafer cleaning tank (30) including a tank body 
(32) containing therein a cleaning solution, and wafer 

supporting device (34) for substantially vertically supporting 
at least one wafer (W) in the tank body, wherein the 

wafer supporting device (34) includes a pair of confronting 
fixed wafer support members (36a, 36b) disposed in the tank 

body with a predetermined space therebetween and each having 
at least one side wafer-supporting portion (40), and a 

movable wafer support member (38) vertically movably disposed 
centrally between the fixed wafer support members at a 

level below the fixed wafer support members and having at 
least one central wafer-supporting portion (42) corresponding 

in position to the position of the side wafer-supporting 
portion of each of the fixed wafer support members, and 

wherein the side wafer-supporting portions (40) and the 
central wafer-supporting portion (42) jointly form a three-point 

support structure which supports the wafer at three 
points on the outer edge thereof. The wafer cleaning tank 

thus constructed is capable of cleaning a plurality of 
wafers at one time and well adaptable to the cleaning of 

wafers of different diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present Invention relates to a wafer cleaning
bath or tank in which one or more wafers of semiconductor
single crystal (hereinafter referred to as "wafers") are
substantially vertically immersed batch by batch in a cleaning
solution to clean off or remove dirt and residual impurities
left on the wafers.In the semiconductor device fabrication, residual
impurities on the surface of a wafer affect the performance
of fabricated semiconductor devices.In view of this, the wafer shaping process includes
a cleaning step in which wafers are cleaned by use of various
cleaning methods. The wafer cleaning methods currently
used are generally classified into a physical cleaning
method and a chemical cleaning method.The physical cleaning method includes: brush scrubbing
in which a cleaning brush is used to directly remove
residual impurities and foreign matters left on the wafer
surface; high-pressure jet scrubbing in which a high-pressure
fluid jet from a nozzle is directed to a portion of or
the entire surface of a wafer to remove impurities; and ultrasonic
cleaning in which wafers are immersed in a solution
and are agitated by ultrasonic energy to remove residual
impurities on the wafers.On the other hand, the chemical cleaning method 
includes: chemical decomposition cleaning in which various
chemicals and enzymes are used to chemically decompose
impurities and foreign matters on the wafer surface. The
physical cleaning method and the chemical cleaning method
may be used in combination it each other.In the semiconductor device fabrication art, the
wafer diameter has been steadily increasing to cope with the
tendency of semiconductor devices toward higher scale integration.
Accordingly, a conventional cleaning method in
which a plurality of wafers are received at one time in the
same carrier cassette requires a great deal of labor.Furthermore, if the wafers are transported while
they are received in the carrier cassette, such transportation
will encounter a problem that the wafers are contaminated
with particles and the like adhering thereto due to
contact between the wafers and the carrier cassette.With the foregoing difficulties in view, the
present inventors have proposed a cassette-less automatic
wafer cleaning equipment in which wafers are substantially
vertically supported one at a time and cleaned by immersing
them one by one in a cleaning solution in each of successive
cleaning baths or vessels (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication
No. 5-36667). Also proposed by the present inventors
have been a wafer

A wafer cleaning tank (30) including a cleaning tank
body (32) containing therein a cleaning solution, and wafer

supporting means (34) for substantially vertically supporting
at least one wafer (W) in said cleaning tank body (32),

characterized in that said wafer supporting means (34)
includes a pair of confronting fixed wafer support members

(36a, 36b) disposed in said cleaning tank body (32) with a
predetermined space therebetween and each having at least one

side wafer-supporting portion (40) receptive of the outer edge
of a wafer (W), and a movable wafer support member (38)

vertically movably disposed centrally between said pair of
fixed wafer support members (36a, 36b) at a level below said

fixed wafer support members (36a, 36b) and having at least one
central wafer-supporting portion (42) receptive of an outer

edge of a wafer (W) and corresponding in position to the
position of said side wafer-supporting portion (40) of each of

said fixed wafer support members (36a, 36b) such that said
side wafer-supporting portions (40) and said central wafer-supporting

portion (42) jointly form a three-point support
structure for supporting a wafer (W) at three points on the

outer edge thereof in a substantially vertical position,
wherein said fixed wafer support members (36a, 36b) and said

movable wafer support member (38) are parallel spaced from one
another and each composed of an elongated round bar having a

plurality of circumferential grooves (40, 42) formed at
regular intervals along the length of said round bar, said

circumferential grooves (40, 42) each forming said side wafer-supporting
portion (40) or said central wafer-supporting

portion (42). 
A wafer cleaning tank according to claim 1, wherein
each end of said movable wafer supporting member (38) is pivotably

connected to two adjustment rods
(48a, 48b) at one of their respective ends, the other ends of each

of said adjustment rods (48a, 48b) being pivotably connected
to respective suspending portions (50a, 50b), wherein the

suspending portions (50a, 50b) connected to the adjustment
rods (48a, 48b) which are connected to one of said opposite

ends of the movable wafer supporting member are hung on one of two confronting side plates (32a, 32a)
of said wafer cleaning tank (32), while the other suspending

portions (50a, 50b) are hung on the other of said two
confronting side plates (32a, 32a), said suspending portions

hung on a respective one of said confronting side plates (50a,
50b) being movable toward and away from each other to move

said movable wafer support member (38) in a vertical
direction.
