<CLAIMS>
Assembly intended for operating on hair, including
a generator (10), a tool holder (3, 30) equipped with

a grip for holding, and a tool (2, 20) mounted on the
tool holder, the generator (10) and the tool holder (3,

30) being arranged to provide the tool (2, 20) with at
least one vapour supply, the generator (10) and the tool

holder (3, 30) being distant from one another and
connected by a flexible bundle (13) including at least

one pipe (51) for supplying the tool holder (3, 30) with
vapour, characterized in that the tool holder (3, 30)

supports a vapour-outlet line (54), the wall of which has
vapour-distribution orifices (58) passing through it, the

vapour-outlet line being located in the tool (2, 20) in
a guide sleeve (61).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the generator (10) is housed in a casing (100)

configured as a trailing device which can be placed on
the ground.
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the vapour is water, alcohol or

some other vapour.
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the generator (10) also makes it possible to convey

other fluids through the tool (2, 20).
Assembly according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the generator (10) includes means for heating the

said other fluids.
Assembly according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the said other fluids are blown and/or sucked

through the tool (2, 20).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the tool holder (3, 30) supports a line (55) for

conveying air through the tool (2, 20).
Assembly according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the line (55) for conveying air through the tool (2,

20) is connected to the suction side of a suction turbine
mounted in the tool holder (3, 30). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the tool holder (3, 30) has a thermophor element

electrical heating resistor (150).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the tool (2, 20) is equipped with a diffuser (64).
Assembly according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the diffuser (64) is arranged such that the vapour

is distributed homogeneously regardless of the extent to
which the bit of hair being treated covers the diffuser.
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the tool (2, 20) is in the general shape of tongs

and includes a lever (65) consisting of a plate (67)
covering the working surface (72) of the tool (2, 20),

the said plate (67) including passages (68) for the
vapour.
