<ABSTRACT>
A portable oscillating sander is described which is capable of 
sanding simultaneously in two planes. The sander (10) includes a 

housing (12) and a sanding head (14) adapted to be attached thereto 
so as to undergo oscillating relative rotation about a predetermined 

axis (16). The sanding head includes a flat sanding surface (18) 
normal to the axis (16) and a part-cylindrical sanding surface (26) 

centred upon the axis (16). The sanding head (14) is a snap-fit on a 
drive spindle (41) of the sander (10) and may be attached in any one 

of a plurality of angular orientations as suits the user. The sanding 
head (14) is of a generally tear-drop shape including a vertex which 

can be used for sanding into corners.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable oscillating sander of 
the type including a housing and a sanding head adapted to be 
attached thereto so as to undergo oscillating relative rotation about a 
predetermined axis. A sanding head according to the preamble of 
claim 1 and a portable oscillating sander according to the preamble 
of claim 2 are known, for example, from EP-A-0 333 933. Typically, sanders of the above type include a triangular sanding 
head, the lower surface of which is covered with abrasive material. 
The triangular shape of head enables the sander to be used for 
sanding into a corner. The sanding heads are detachable from the 
sander to enable their replacement either when they are worn out or 
when a coarser or finer abrasive is required. Typically, the sanding heads taper from a largest cross-section 
corresponding to the sanding surface through decreasing 
cross-sections until the upper surface of the sanding head is reached. 
This enables the sanding surface to reach right into a corner, for 
example, unimpeded by the impingement of other regions of the 
sanding head on the workpiece. Such sanders are useful for sanding 
in one plane only. It is an object of the present invention to provide a portable 
oscillating sander which is capable of sanding in two planes and also 
to provide a sanding head for such a sander. Accordingly, the present invention provides a sanding head for a 
portable oscillating sander, adapted to be attached thereto so as to 
undergo oscillating relative rotation about a predetermined axis of 
the head, the sanding head including a substantially flat sanding  
 
surface substantially normal to the said axis and a second sanding 
surface formed by rotation of a line about an axis substantially 
coincident with the said predetermined axis. The invention also provides a portable oscillating sander 
including a housing and a sanding head adapted to be attached 
thereto so as to undergo oscillating relative rotation about a 
predetermined axis, the sanding head including a substantially flat 
sanding surface substantially normal to the said axis and a second 
sanding surface formed by rotation of a line about an axis 
substantially coincident with the said predetermined axis. It will be understood that the substantially flat sanding surface is 
the equivalent of the sanding surface discussed above with reference 
to existing portable sanders. The second sanding surface is 
preferably substantially part-conical, and is useful for sanding in a 
plane lying at
