<ABSTRACT>
Described is an office-desk kit with desktops of various shapes and sizes, desktop-support frames (6, 12) with top bars (8, 13, 14) designed to support the edges of the desktops and two longitudinal struts (10, 16, 17) per desktop to connect the two top bars to each other, the longitudinal struts being disposed a certain distance from the front and back edges of the desktop. The kit also includes feet (22, 30), the top bars and the feet having vertical bores in them into which vertical pillars can be inserted to form legs (20, 26, 28) of various shapes. The kit enables a large number of different desk designs to be produced, in particular designs with fitting desktops. By fitting the pillars differently between the feet and the top bars, legs of various shapes can be produced designated by the letters n, T and C. The kit includes trapezoidal desktops (45) whose geometrical shape is the result of combining a rectangular or square surface (48) with a surface in the shape of a right-angled isosceles triangle (50).
