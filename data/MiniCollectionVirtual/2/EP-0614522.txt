<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to pressure transducers and, more 
particularly, to pressure transducers which incorporate stress reducing configurations 
to permit the measurement of extremely low pressures while avoiding measurement 
errors which can be caused by stresses that result from temperature changes or 
external forces exerted on the transducer. Many different types of pressure transducers are known to those skilled in the 
art. One particular type of pressure transducer utilizes a silicon substrate having a 
diaphragm portion that is flexible responsive to pressure on the surface of the 
diaphragm. In these types of pressure transducers, it is very well known to provide a 
plurality of piezoresistive devices on the diaphragm. These piezoresistive devices are 
usually connected in a bridge arrangement so that changes in resistance of the devices 
can be electrically determined from stress induced changes in resistivity of the 
piezoresistive devices. When the diaphragm of the substrate is deformed in response 
to the pressure on the diaphragm, the piezoresistive devices experience a stress which 
alters their resistive characteristics. Measurement of the resistance of the 
piezoresistive devices permits the magnitude of deformation of the diaphragm to be 
determined which, in turn, allows the pressure on the diaphragm to be calculated. If 
the pressure transducer is intended for use in measuring differential pressure, a first 
pressure is exposed to one side of the diaphragm and a second pressure is exposed to 
the other side. United States Patent 4,333,349, which issued to Mallon et al on June 8, 1982, 
describes a particular balancing network for use in association with a piezoresistive 
semiconductor bridge configuration of the type which is commonly used in pressure 
sensors. The balancing network comprises a plurality of series resistors connected to 
the sensing elements in the bridge configuration. Each of the resistors differs from 
the previous one according to a power of two in order to form a binary ladder 
arrangement. The individual resistors are associated with terminals to allow the 
transducer manufacturer to selectively short one or more resistors to provide zero 
balance compensation. The resistors are located on the nonactive portion of the 
semiconductor substrate and are fabricated by the same techniques employed for 
fabrication of the semiconductor piezoresistive sensing elements to assure temperature 
tracking of the unit with the desired temperature operating
