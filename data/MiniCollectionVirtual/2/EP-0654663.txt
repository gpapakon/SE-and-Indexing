<ABSTRACT>
Method for elementary analysis by optical emission spectroscopy on a plasma produced by a laser in the presence of argon. According to the invention, the method consists, in a natural atmosphere, in:   - simultaneously blowing a gas jet onto the sample (6) to be analysed and focusing a laser beam (4) on the said sample to be analysed, so as to produce a plasma (12) on the surface of this sample; - analysing a spectrum (S') of the light radiation emitted by the plasma; and - determining, on the basis of this spectral analysis, the isotopic composition of the sample.

Process for the elementary analysis of a solid sample, 
characterized in 
that
 it consists of: 

choosing a solid sample to be analyzed in a natural atmosphere without 
having to place said sample in a chamber constituting a confined zone, 
simultaneously focussing a laser beam (4) on said solid sample to be 
analyzed so as to produce a plasma (12) at an impact point (P) of the 

surface of said sample and blowing a gas jet directly onto said impact 
point (P) of the sample (6), 
analyzing a spectrum (S') of the light radiation emitted by the plasma and 
determining, on the basis of said spectrum analysis, the elementary 
composition of the solid sample. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the gas jet blown 
onto the solid sample is an argon jet. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the gas jet 
blown onto the sample has a diameter larger than that of the plasma obtained 

on the sample surface. 
Process according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the argon jet 
blown onto the sample has a flow rate of approximately 3 l/mn. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 
the laser beam forms on the sample a focal spot with a diameter of 

approximately 10 Âµm.
