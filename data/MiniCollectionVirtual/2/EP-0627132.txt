<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
conformable self sealing seal for the cables entering an 
end of a closure for a cable splice or termination, and 
in one aspect to an improved environmental seal to 
restrict migration of fluids into or out of a closure. The prior art related to end seals for splice 
closures for cable splice closures or terminations is 
replete with systems for fitting a variety of wire or 
cable diameters and a variety of closure ends. One of 
these end seals is described in United States patent No. 
4,902,855 and assigned to the assignee of the present 
application. This end seal comprises a foam collar which 
is fitted about the cable or cables and an annular ring 
is placed about the collar and it is cut to fit about a 
cable on a finished splice, and the ring has a cut which 
joins the inner opening to the outer periphery and along 
a path which is tangential to the inner opening. U.S. Patent No. 4,963,698 describes a sealed 
cable article and method for sealing the area between two 
cables and an enclosure where the cables exit from the 
closure. The article comprises a shaped article of 
polymeric gel having a cone penetration value of about 30 
to about 400 (10⁻¹ mm) and an elongation of from 25% to 
about 850%. The gels are widely known in the art, for 
example silicone-based gels, polyurethane-based gels or 
polystyrenebutadienestyrene, polystyrene-isoprene-styrene, 
and polystyrene-ethylene butylene-styrene block 
copolymer based gels. The inventors preferred gelloid 
compositions comprising a crosslinked non-silicone 
polymer having an olefinic unsaturated content of less 
than 10 mole percent and having dispersed therein a 
liquid in an amount of from about 20% to about 95% by 
weight based on the weight of the liquid and polymer and  
 
from 0 to 0.3 volume fraction of a filler. The shaped 
article preferably has a number of holes preferably 
slightly smaller than the size of the cables. The gel 
will stretch to accommodate the increased size cables. 
There is a slit extending from the edge of each hole to 
the outer edge of the article so that the shaped article 
may be placed around the cables without access to the 
free end of the cable. Figures 4, 5 and 6 illustrate the 
shapes of the article. Articles of a similar shape are illustrated in 
French patent 1,168,267, in Figs. 18, 19 and 20. PCT 
application WO 90/05401, published 17 May 1990 also 
discloses an end seal to fit about a plurality of cables 
and which is made of a gel, i.e. a liquid-extended 
po

<CLAIMS>
An end seal for a cable splice or termination 
closure adapted to seal the space between the cables and 

between the cables and the closure to restrict fluid 
transfer through the seal, comprising an elastic flexible 

member (18) having a core portion (20) having an outer 
peripheral surface (30) and spaced ends (26), and at least 

two cylindrical openings formed through the member extending 
between said ends (26) and each communicating with the outer 

peripheral surface to allow the member to be positioned 
about a cable with the cables disposed 
in the openings, 
characterized in that walls (25) form said at least two 

cylindrical openings (24) through said core portion (20), 
said walls defining a cylindrical arcuate surface beginning 

and ending at the outer peripheral surface (30) of the core 
portion (20) to define an entrance slot to each opening (24) 

from the periphery (30) of the core portion, and in that an 
extended tail portion (22), having opposite inner and outer 

surfaces (32, 34) joined by side edges and a free end (36), 
is joined to the core portion, the tail portion (22) being 

integral with and extending from the outer peripheral 
surface of the core portion (20) with the inner surface (32) 

being formed tangential to one of said walls (25) forming one 
of said openings (24), said tail portion (22) having 

sufficient length to wrap about said peripheral surface (30) 
of the core portion to cover all the entrance slots of the 

openings (24) and the cables to be placed therein, with said 
free end (36) of the tail portion (22) tapering to an end of 

reduced thickness. 
An end seal according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said openings (24) are of various arcuate 

dimensions and are formed in the core portion (20) in 
peripherally spaced relationship. 
An end seal according to claim 1 characterized 
in that the end seal is formed of a material having an 

inherent self-adhesive property such that there is  
 

created a high frictional coefficient between the tail 
portion (22) and the core portion (20) and between wraps 

of the tail portion about the core portion. 
An end seal according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the tail portion (22) is tapered along its length such 

that the width of the inner and outer surfaces of the tail 
portion (22) at the free end (36) is narrower than the 

adjacent core portion (20). 
An end seal according to claim 1 characterized in 
that said tail portion (22) is tapered transversely of the 

width thereof such that one side edge becomes increasingly 
thinner than the other side edge along the length of the 

tail portion. 
An end seal according to claim 4 characterized in 
that said tail portion (22) is tapered transversely of the 

width thereof such that one side edge becomes increasingly 
thinner than the other side edge along the length of the 

tail portion. 
An end seal according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said tail portion (22) is provided with oblique 

slits (31) in spaced relationship along its length to 
afford easy shortening of the length of the tail if the 

diameter of a cooperating closure end is smaller than the 
diameter of the core portion (20) with the entire tail 

portion (22) wrapped about the core portion. 
An end seal according to claim 1, 2 or 6 
characterized in that said core portion (20) is generally 

circular. 
An end seal according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 6 
characterized in that said core portion (22) is generally 

oblong. 
An end seal according to claim 1, 2, 3, or 6 
characterized in that the tail portion (22d) is formed 

with a rib (33) on one surface and a groove (35) on the 
opposite surface such that upon wrapping the tail portion 

about the core portion, the mating rib and groove 
increase the frictional forces needed to slide the 

wrapped portions axially of the openings.  
 
An end seal according to claim 1, 2, 6 or 10

flexible material is selected from the group consisting 
of gels, elastomers, mastics and foams.
