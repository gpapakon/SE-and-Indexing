<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides improvements in 
tobacco expansion processes which are capable of 

dramatically improving tobacco throughput in high 
pressure tobacco impregnation systems. In accordance 

with various aspects of the invention, tobacco can be 
impregnated in a high pressure impregnation zone and 

removed from the zone for expansion in complete cycle 
times of less than one minute, typically less than 

about 15-30 seconds. In addition, tobacco throughputs 
are further improved in accordance with other aspects 

of the invention by achieving dramatically improved use 
of the available treatment space in a high pressure 

impregnation zone. In addition, the invention provides 
processes for minimizing the amount of expansion agent 

used to treat tobacco.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processes
for expanding tobacco. More particularly,
the invention relates to processes for
improving throughput and economics of tobacco
expansion.In the past two decades, tobacco expansion
processes have become an important part of the
cigarette manufacturing process. Tobacco expansion
processes are used to restore tobacco bulk density
and/or volume which are lost during curing and storage
of tobacco leaf. In addition, expanded tobacco is an
important component of many low tar and ultra-low tar
cigarettes.Commercially significant tobacco expansion
processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,524,451 to
Fredrickson and U.S. Patent No. 3,524,452 to Moser et
al. These patents describe processes in which tobacco
is contacted with an impregnant and then heated rapidly
to volatilize the impregnant and expand the tobacco. A
variation of these processes is described in U.S.
Patent No. 3,683,937 to Fredrickson et al. which
discloses a tobacco expansion process employing an
organic compound in the vapor state for impregnating 
tobacco. The impregnated tobacco is expanded either by
heating or rapidly reducing pressure.The use of a carbon dioxide for expanding
tobacco is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,235,250 to
Utsch; U.S. Patent No. 4,258,729 to Burde et al.; and
U.S. Patent No. 4,336,814 to Sykes et al., among
others. In these and related processes, carbon
dioxide, either in gas or liquid form, is contacted
with tobacco for impregnation and thereafter the
impregnated tobacco is subjected to rapid heating
conditions to volatilize the carbon dioxide and thereby
expand the tobacco. In the known carbon dioxide
expansion processes, it is typically necessary to heat
the tobacco excessively in order to achieve substantial
and stable expansion of the tobacco. This excessive
heating can harm the tobacco flavor and/or generate an
excessive amount of tobacco fines. In addition, those
processes which use liquid carbon dioxide for
impregnating tobacco typically result in impregnated
tobacco in the form of solid blocks of tobacco
containing dry ice, which must be broken up prior to
heat treatment, thereby increasing the complexity of
the process.U.S. Patent No. 4,461,310 to Zeihn and U.S.
Patent No. 4,289,148 to Zeihn describe the expansion of
tobacco employing supercritical nitrogen or argon
impregnation of tobacco. These gases are removed from
the tobacco during a rapid pressure reduction, and the
tobacco is expanded by exposure to heated gas or
microwave. These processes require treatment of
tobacc

<CLAIMS>
A process for increasing the filling capacity of tobacco
by volume expansion of said tobacco, the process

comprising the steps of

placing into an impregnation chamber capable of
withstanding elevated pressure conditions a charge of

tobacco to be expanded,
impregnating said tobacco charge in said chamber with
propane as an expansion agent under conditions

sufficient to provide impregnated tobacco capable of
expanding at least about 50 % when exposed to expansion

conditions, and
removing the impregnated tobacco charge from said
chamber and subjecting the impregnated tobacco to

conditions sufficient to expand the tobacco,

characterized in that for impregnating the tobacco to be
expanded said tobacco is compressed at a compression

ratio of at least 1,5 : 1 relative to the loose fill
volume of the tobacco to be expanded, and that the

available impregnation volume of said chamber is
substantially filled with said compressed tobacco to be

impregnated.
The process of claim 1, wherein said compression ratio
is at least 2 : 1, preferably at least 3 : 1. 
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein said impregnation
step is conducted under temperature conditions at or

above about the supercritical temperature of the
expansion agent.
The process of one or several of claims 1 to 3, wherein
said impregnation step is conducted at or above about

the supercritical pressure of the expansion agent.
The process of one or several of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the tobacco to be impregnated is preheated to an

elevated temperature prior to being placed in said
impregnation chamber.
The process of claim 5, wherein the tobacco is preheated
to a temperature of at least 52°C.
The process of one or several of claims 1 to 6, wherein
said impregnation step is conducted during a period of

less than one minute.
The process of one or several of claims 1 to 7, wherein
the expansion agent is admitted into the impregnation

chamber as a fluid having a temperature above the
supercritical temperature of the fluid and a pressure

above the supercritical pressure of the fluid.
The process of one or several of claims 1 to 8, wherein
the propane is introduced into the impregnation chamber

at a pressure above about 142 kg/cm
2
 above ambient
pressure (2000 psig) and at a temperature above about

116°C (240°F).
