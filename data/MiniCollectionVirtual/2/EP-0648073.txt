<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clearing apparatus for
use in clearing operations. The invention further
relates to a carriage for use in supporting a clearing
apparatus.The clearing apparatus of this invention is, in one
aspect, in the form of a trimmer apparatus. The clearing
apparatus is, in another aspect, in the form of a blower
apparatus. The clearing apparatus is, in another aspect,
in the form of a vacuum apparatus. The clearing
apparatus may also, in another aspect, be convertible
between the various aspects of the invention.Where the clearing apparatus of this invention is in
the form of a trimmer apparatus, it has particular
application in the cutting of vegetation in the form of
grass, weeds, shrubs and the like. The trimmer apparatus
has particular application in regard to a trimmer or
cutter of the type which uses a cutting line for cutting
or trimming vegetation. The trimmer apparatus can,
however, also have application in regard to a trimmer
which uses a cutter blade for cutting or trimming
vegetation.Where the clearing apparatus of this invention is in
the form of a blower apparatus, or a vacuum apparatus, it
may have application in clearing indoors or outdoors
areas of dust, debris, leaves, etc. A clearing apparatus for use in harvesting of tobacco or
analogous plants is known (FR-A-21 99 635) which comprises a
long stem, a motor at a rear end of the stem and a carriage
with a cutting head at a front end of the stem. A single
wheel is rotatably mounted at a lateral side of the carriage
and a harness to be worn by an operator is provided in an intermediate
portion of the stem. This known apparatus has the
disadvantage of straining the operator with weight carrying
on one hand and being only poorly manoeuvrable on the other
hand, since the apparatus cannot be readily moved in a lateral
direction and turning requires a lot of room.Furthermore, there are a number of prior patents
which disclose various forms of wheeled carriages for supporting
trimmers. These patents include U.S. Patent Nos.
4,845,929 --Saki et al.; 3,977,078 --Pittenjar; 4,936,886
--Quillen; 4,182,100 --Litter; 4,891,931 --Holland; 4,442,659
--Enbusk; 4,981,012 --Claiborne; and 4,829,755 --Nance. These
patents do, for the most part, present a number of disadvantages.Some of these disadvantages are that the operator has to support
a major portion of the weight of the apparatus; that the
apparatus is not supported near its center of gravity; that
the apparatus is designed to be operated lawn-mower fashion
so that lateral
