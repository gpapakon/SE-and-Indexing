<ABSTRACT>
A shoesole consists of an upper sole part (1) made of wood and of an outsole (7) situated therebelow. In the ball region, the upper sole part (1) is divided so that a number of narrow strips (3) running transversely to the longitudinal direction of the sole are created, which are connected to one another and to the front and the rear sole part (4, 5) by flexible intermediate pieces (6). The strips (3) are formed from at least two parts (3', 3''), the mutually adjacent end faces (10) of which run essentially in the longitudinal direction of the sole and are likewise interconnected by flexible intermediate pieces (11).

A shoe sole having a wooden upper sole-part (1) whose, preferably 
orthopaedically shaped, upper side (2) forms the support for the sole 

of the foot, and having an outsole (7) which is arranged below the 
upper sole-part (1) and is made of a resilient and flexible material, 

the upper sole-part (1) being divided, in the region of the ball of 
the foot at least, into a plurality of strips (3) which run 

transversely to the longitudinal direction of the sole and are 
connected to one another by means of flexible intermediate pieces (6) 

preferably made of polyurethane expanded onto the wood, characterised 
in that the strips (3) are formed of at least two parts (3', 3'') whose 

adjacent faces (10) extend substantially in the longitudinal 
direction of the sole and are also mutually connected by means of 

flexible intermediate pieces (11). 
A shoe sole in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that all 
the intermediate pieces (6, 11) are formed in one piece. 
The shoe sole in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the intermediate pieces (6,11) are formed in one piece with the 

outsole (7). 
A method of manufacturing a shoe sole in accordance with any one of 
the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the lower side of a piece of 

wood forming the upper sole-part (1) is provided in the region of the 
ball of the foot with a plurality of notches formed for example by 

milling, these notches at least partially dividing the piece of wood 
which forms the upper sole-part (1), in that then this piece of wood 

is inserted into a mould, in that then a fluid plastics material is 
introduced into the mould and allowed to solidify, the intermediate 

pieces (6) and the outsole (7) in one piece with these pieces being 
formed in the region of the notches, and in that finally the sole part 

produced in this manner is removed from the mould. 
A method in accordance with claim 4, characterised in that a 
polyurethane-forming material is introduced into the mould.  

 
A method in accordance with claim 4, characterised in that the 
fluid plastics material is made to expand. 
A method in accordance with claim 4, characterised in that after 
removal from the mould, at least the upper side of the piece of wood 

forming the upper sole-part (1) is processed in a material-removing 
manner, preferably milled.
