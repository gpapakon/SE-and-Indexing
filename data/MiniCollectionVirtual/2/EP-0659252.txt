<ABSTRACT>
A valve arrangement, in particular an electromagnetic valve arranggement for slip controlled motor vehicle brake systems, has a first valve closure member (4), in particular a hydraulically controlled nonreturn valve, and an additional valve closure member (3), preferably controllable by means of a magnet armature and magnet coil, which is arranged in a valve reception bore (2) of the valve arrangement-receiving valve housing (1). Both valve closure members (3, 4) can be switched independently from each other and are arranged together in the valve reception bore (2) of the additional valve closure member (3). A valve arrangement which is compact and simple to produced is thus obtained.

A valve arrangement, particularly a solenoid valve 
arrangement for slip-controlled automotive vehicle brake 

systems, with a first valve closure member (4) which is 
actuatable hydraulically by the throughflowing medium, as 

well as with a second valve closure member (3) arranged 
with the first valve closure member (4) in a valve 

accommodating bore (2) of the valve housing (1) which 
accommodates the valve arrangement, with both valve closure 

members (3, 4) being operable in the valve housing (1) 
independently of each other in terms of action, wherein the 

valve accommodating bore (2) of the second valve closure 
member (3) has bore steps (9, 9') which hold a valve 

accommodating body (6) in the valve accommodating bore (2), 
wherein the insertion of the valve accommodating body (6) 

into the valve housing (1) is rendered possible by means of 
a bore step (9') having an enlarged opening cross-section, 

and wherein the valve accommodating body (6) includes valve 
seat surfaces and a stepped bore (10) in which the first 

valve closure member (4) and its associated seat surface is 
arranged,
 
characterized in that a bore step (9) in the valve housing 

(1) sufficiently overlaps the stepped bore (10) of the 
first valve closure member (4), which accommodates the 

first valve closure member (4), so as to prevent the first 
valve closure member (4) from falling out of the stepped 

bore (10) of the valve accommodating body (6). 
A valve arrangement as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that a pressure medium passage (11) 

appertaining to the second valve closure member (3) lies on  
 

the axis of rotation of the valve accommodating body (6) 
that is preferably designed as a valve plate, and in that 

the stepped bore (10) of the first valve closure member (4) 
is arranged in the valve accommodating body (6) of the 

second valve closure member (3) in an eccentric manner and, 
by approximation, coplanar to the pressure medium passage 

(11). 
A valve arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2,
 
characterized in that the first valve closure member (4) 

is arranged in the valve accommodating body (6). 
A valve arrangement as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that a bore step (9') accommodates the 

valve accommodating body (6) in a frictionally engaged 
manner, preferably by way of caulking. 
A valve arrangement as claimed in claim 2,
 
characterized in that the transitions of the
 stepped bore 
(10) and the pressure medium passage (11) in the valve 

accommodating body (6) are formed by conical valve seat 
surfaces which can be abutted by the valve closure members 

(3, 4). 
A valve arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims 1 through 3 and 5,
 
characterized in that the first valve closure member (4) is 

designed as a hydraulically operable ball-type non-return 
valve, and in that the second valve closure member (3) 

which in terms of construction and of action is connected  
 

parallel is electromagnetically operable. 
A valve arrangement as claimed in claim 6,
 
characterized in that the first valve closure member (4) 

closes the hydraulic communication between a pressure 
medium consumer (12), in particular a slip-controlled wheel 

brake, and a braking pressure generator, preferably acting 
as pressure medium source (13), in the direction of the 

pressure medium consumer (12). 
A valve arrangement, particularly a solenoid valve 
arrangement for slip-controlled automotive vehicle brake 

systems, with a first valve closure member (4) which is 
actuatable hydraulically by the throughflowing medium as 

well as with a second valve closure member (3), that is 
preferably electromagnetically controllable by means of an 

armature and a magnet coil and arranged with the first 
valve closure member (4) in a valve accommodating bore (2) 

of the valve housing (1) which accommodates the valve 
arrangement, with both valve closure members (3, 4) being 

operable in the valve housing (1) independently of each 
other in terms of action,
 
characterized in that, in the valve accommodating bore 

(2), a first and a second valve accommodating body (5, 6) 
having valve seat surfaces cover each other and interact 

with the valve closure members (3, 4) in such a fashion 
that, by means of coaxial overlapping of pressure medium 

passages (7, 8) with different passage widths in the valve 
accommodating bodies (5, 6), a stepped bore is formed in 

the first valve accommodating body (5), which stepped bore 
accommodates the first valve closure member (4) and has the  

 
associated seat surface, wherein the first valve closure 

member (4) is arranged eccentrically in the first valve 
accommodating body (5) and the second valve closure member 

(3) comes to abut a bore (11) which is situated in the 
second valve accommodating body (6) having the associated 

seat surface in a rotationally symmetrical manner.
