<ABSTRACT>
A bichromatic pyrometer for detecting the high temperature of a surface element of an object, comprising two photodiodes (18, 19) receiving the radiation from the object, each having a wide forbidden band sensitive to radiation in a given range of wavelengths, these sensitivity ranges being different, and lying in the visible or close to the visible, and being obtained by choice of the value of the forbidden band of the constituent material of each of the photodiodes (18) and (19), which is greater than or equal to that of silicon (
>
/= 1.11 eV). Determination of rapidly changing surface temperatures with high precision.
