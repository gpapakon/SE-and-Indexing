<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus including a cover
that mounts a solar battery, according to the preamble of claim
1 and a method for preparing a cover according to the preamble
of claim 26.Conventionally, various applications associated
with a portable electronic equipment with a solar
battery have been proposed. In particular, as for a
heat insulation or dissipation (radiation) structure to
a main body equipment, as described in
EP-A-0 372 933 (JP-U-63-160056), a secondary
battery and a solar battery are integrally detachable
from a main body. When energy is to be charged under
the solar light, the batteries are detached from the
main body, and consequently, the main body equipment is
protected from heat.However, in such a structure, an
attachment/detachment mechanism becomes undesirably
complicated, and a contact portion is easily
contaminated, thus causing a conduction failure.
Furthermore, when a user erroneously places the main
body equipment as a whole under the solar light, the
temperature of the main body equipment increases,
resulting in troubles. In recent years, a lithium ion battery available
from Sony Energy Tech Kabushiki Kaishya has
characteristics suitable for a combination with a solar
battery, i.e., it has no memory effect and suffers less
self-discharging as compared to a conventional
nickel-cadmium battery. However, the lithium ion
battery is weak against a high temperature. Overcoming
this drawback poses a bottleneck in the manufacture of
a portable electronic equipment with a solar battery. According to the DE-A-29 07 155 a solar battery can be
attached to a body of a camera as an apparatus.A generic apparatus using a solar battery is known from the
DE-U-90 00 240. According thereto, a solar battery is arranged
on a cover. A space forming portion forms a space such that heat
influence between the body of the apparatus and the solar
battery is reduced.It is an object of the present invention to further develop
an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 such that
influence of the heat of the solar battery is reduced.This object is achieved by the features of claim 1.Advantageous further developments of the apparatus are set
out in the dependent claims.A method for preparing a cover of an apparatus is defined in
claim 26.According to the invention, the cover on which the solar
battery is arranged has a side surface which extends to a side
surface of the apparatus.By these means, deterioration or destruction of the
apparatus, the secondary battery, an image
