<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a composition for topical administration 
of pharmacologically active or cosmetic substances in which said 

substances are present in an emulsion comprising aloe vera gel and 
modified natural collagen the amino acids of which are free 

because of breakage of the covalent dehydrolysine-norleucine bonds 
between the polypeptide chains. 
The said emulsion of aloe vera and modified natural collagen 
itself possesses antiphlogistic and cicatrizant therapeutic 

properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition comprising, as essential 
components, an emulsion of aloe vera gel and modified natural 
collagen usable both for topical administration of 
pharmacologically active or cosmetic substances, and as such for 
dermatological therapeutic use as an antiphlogistic or 
cicatrizant. It is known to use in the cosmetic and therapeutic field 
lyophilized heterologous sheets and hydrolyzed solutions of 
natural collagens (of animal origin), used together with 
pharmacologically active principles (such as hyaluronic acid) or 
with the common ingredients of cosmetic products. For example, sterilized lyophilized heterologous collagen is used 
topically in surgery to facilitate the treatment of many dermic 
lesions (such as deep burns, bed sores, varicose ulcers) and as a 
hemostatic in dentistry. Lyophilized collagen is mainly used for 
its absorbent and hemostatic power. Lyophilized collagen sheets or plates can be enriched with the 
most varied active principles which exhibit their activity (once 
applied to the cutis) practically without any direct influence of 
the collagen. Hydrolyzed solutions of natural collagens are mainly used in 
cosmetics.  It is well known that collagen is a scleroprotein forming the main 
component of fibrous connective tissue. It is present in animal 
products such as tendons, cartilage, skin etc. Collagen consists 
of polypeptide chains formed from amino acid residues with peptide 
bonds. According to Rich and Crickm, each polypeptide chain is arranged 
as a spiral, the chains being twisted together in threes with 
opposite twist, forming a superposed spiral. They can be linked 
transversely by hydrogen bridges. Collagen is insoluble in organic solvents, in water and in dilute 
acid and alkaline solutions at ordinary temperature, in which it 
absorbs water and undergoes characteristic swelling. When heated in water to a determined temperature (contraction 
temperature) the collagen fibres undergo irreversible contraction, 
explained by the fact that the polypeptide chains diverge because 
water molecules are introduced between them, causing their radical 
modification. If the heating in water is prolonged above the contraction 
temperature the collagen is transformed into gelatin. The present invention relates to a composition comprising collagen 
which has been mechanically modified by emulsion together with 
aloe vera. Aloe vera is itself a fundamental component in that 
its presence is decisive for preparing the modified collagen. The process

<CLAIMS>
A composition with therapeutic and cosmetic activity for 
topical use, characterised by comprising an emulsion of aloe vera 

and modified natural collagen the amino acids of which are free 
because of breakage of the covalent dehydrolysine-norleucine bonds 

between the polypeptide chains, the aloe vera:collagen weight 
ratio being within the range 1.7-2.3:0.7-1.3. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the aloe vera:collagen weight ratio is 2:1. 
A composition as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that said emulsion comprises substances with pharmacological 

and/or cosmetic activity. 
A composition as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
said substances are chosen from antibiotics, hyaluronic acid, 

alginic acid, allantoin, wild rose oil, vitamins, alpha-bisabolol 
and bovine bile salts. 
A composition as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterised 
by being applied in the form of a thin layer on a support of 

textile nature. 
A method for preparing the compositions of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by preparing a first emulsion of "inverse mixture" 

type by mixing oils and/or fatty substances with an aqueous 
solution of natural collagen and aloe vera gel, and a second 

emulsion of "direct mixture" type by mixing oils and/or fatty 
substances with solubilizers to which an aqueous solution 

comprising natural collagen in aqueous solution and aloe vera gel 
is added, said first and second emulsion being then mixed together 

in a microemulsifying reactor. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that said 
pharmacologically active substances are added to said second 

emulsion.
