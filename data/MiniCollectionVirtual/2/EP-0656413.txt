<ABSTRACT>
Porous alumina bodies useful as catalyst support have a trimodal pore 
distribution. The Total Pore Volume is about 0.65 - 1.30 cc/g; 2-20% of the 

Total Pore Volume is in form of macropores of diameter between 10.000 and 
100.000 Angstrom, 5-30% of the Total Pore Volume is in form of macropores 

of diameter between 1.000 and 10.000 Angstrom, and 50-93% of the Total Pore 
Volume is in form of mesopores of diameter between 30 and 1.000 Angstrom. 
Hydrodesulfurization and demetallalization of hydrocarbon charge is effected 
by hydrogenation in the presence of, as catalyst, a Group VI A metal and a 

non-noble Group VIII metal on the trimodal alumina support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to alumina catalysts and 
their use in a process for converting heavy hydrocarbons 
to lighter hydrocarbons. More particularly it relates to 
removal of sulfur and contaminant metals from heavy 
hydrocarbons during hydrocarbon conversion. Economic considerations dictate that heavy oils or residua 
obtained during petroleum refining be upgraded to 
distillate fractions of higher economic value. It is 
desirable to convert bitumen or heavy crude oils to synthetic 
crude oils of lower boiling point so that they may 
be processed in conventional downstream operations. This 
may be carried out by hydrogenation of these materials at 
high temperature and high pressure. Typically this is 
carried out in an ebullated bed wherein the upflowing 
liquid charge contacts the catalyst which may be present 
in the form of extrudates of diameter of 0.7 - 1.6mm. Those skilled in the art have attempted to improve the 
catalyst systems used in the various processes for 
hydrogenation of heavy oils. Typical of prior art 
attempts to develop improved catalysts may be noted the 
following: US-A-4,657,665 discloses a catalyst of high macroporosity. 
The Total Pore Volume (TPV) is 0.85 - 1.5 cc/g; 0.15 - 
0.40 cc/g of the Total Pore Volume is contained within 
pores having a diameter of 1200A or greater . The final 
composition contains VI B metal (as oxide) in amount of 
3.5% - 5%. US-A-4,395,328 discloses a catalyst wherein at least 0.8 
cc/g of the TPV is contained within pores having a 
diameter of 0 - 120A and at least 0.1 cc/g is contained 
within pores having a diameter of 1200 - 50,000A.  US-A-4,328,127 discloses a catalyst in which 40% - 75% of 
the TPV is contained within pores having a diameter of 
150A - 200A and up to 5% of the TPV is contained within 
pores having a diameter greater than 1000A. US-A-4,309,278 discloses a catalyst in which not more than 
0.2 cc/g of the TPV is contained in pores of diameter 
greater than 400A. US-A-4,297,242 discloses a catalyst wherein at least 95% 
of the TPV is contained in pores having a diameter less 
than 130A. US-A-4,225,421 discloses a catalyst wherein 3 - 30% of the 
TPV is contained in pores having a diameter greater than 
600A. US-A-4,089,774 discloses a catalyst wherein at least 45% 
of the TPV is contained in pores having a diameter of 30 - 
150A and at least 10% of TPV is contained in pores having 
a diameter of at least 300A. US-A-4,082,695 discloses a catalyst wherein at least 5% of 
the TPV is contained in pores having a diameter of
