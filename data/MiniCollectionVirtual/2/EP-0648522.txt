<ABSTRACT>
An electric field is applied to a coalescer type filter 
element (13) in which the mesh size decreases in a step-like manner toward 

its outside. A subject liquid is passed through the filter from its 
inside to outside. A primary processed liquid discharged from the 

filter is introduced into an oil-water separating space (24) provided 
outside the filter, which space has an elongated path and to which 

space an electric field is applied. While the primary processed 
liquid passes through the oil-water separating space, rise of 

separated oil and fall of separated water are facilitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charged coalescer type oil-water
separating apparatus which efficiently separates water from
water-containing oil or oil from oil-containing water to enable their
recycling, and which contributes to not only saying of resources and
energy but also cleaning of the earth environment by reducing waste
oil and liquids.To prevent the earth environment from being polluted, strict
regulations on the release of waste oil and liquids to the natural
environment have been established in recent years. These regulations
require to reduce the total amount of waste oil and liquids and,
therefore, it is an urgent subject to separate and collect water and
oil from water-containing oil and oil-containing water. The
separation and collection of water and oil from water-containing oil
and oil-containing water is also required for the purpose of saving
resources and energy, which is another important issue.Among oil-water separating apparatuses, a coalescer type
apparatus is well known. The coalescer type oil-water separating
apparatus uses a coalescer type filter element in which filtering
materials are different in mesh size and are layered such that meshes
become finer in a step-like manner toward the downstream side in the
fluid passing direction. The most general form of this type of oil-water
separating apparatus is as follows. A cylindrical coalescer
type filter element is disposed at the center of a container, and a 
pressurized liquid to be processed is introduced into the container
from the outside and passed through the filter element from its
outside to inside. While the liquid is passed through the filter
element, oil particles are interrupted by meshes that become finer in
a step-like manner in the liquid passing direction, and caused to go
up. Water thus separated is extracted from the axial portion of the
filter element.Another oil-water separating apparatus is known which was
proposed in Japanese Patent Application No. Hei. 1-213168 entitled "
Two Liquid Separating Methods and Apparatuses for Implementing them"
filed by the present applicant. This apparatus has the following
configuration. A single layer, cylindrical filter element having
meshes of an uniform size over the entire area is disposed at the
center of a cylindrical container also serving as an outer cylinder
grounding electrode. A central cylinder electrode having the same
potential as the outer cylinder grounding electrode is placed at the
axial position of the filter element. On the other hand, a
cylindrical

an outer cylinder grounding electrode (1) also serving as a main
body container;
a central cylinder electrode (11) provided inside the outer
cylinder grounding electrode (1), given the same potential as the outer

cylinder grounding electrode (1), and having a plurality of liquid
passing holes (10) and one open end (12) serving as an inlet of a pressurized

separated oil accumulation space communicated with a separated oil

outlet (2) and as a separated water accumulation space communicated with
a separated water outlet (5), respectively;
a cylindrical charge electrode (14) made of a perforated metal
plate or a mesh-like metal body and disposed outside the filter

element (13) so as to be in contact with or in close proximity to an outer 
cylindrical surface of the filter element (13); and

separating space (24, 24a) so as to be concentric with the outer cylinder

grounding electrode (1), for elongating a liquid passing path,

potential of impurity particles in the subject liquid is applied

between the outer cylinder grounding electrode (1) and the cylindrical

cylindrical charge electrode (14); and

from an outside of the container into an internal space of the

central cylinder electrode (11), and passed through the fitter element from
its inside to outside to produce a primary processed liquid that has

been subjected to filtration and preliminary cohesion, which primary
processed liquid is introduced into the oil-water separating space (24, 24a)

where separated oil and water are accumulated in the respective
accumulation spaces during a process that the primary processed liquid

flows upward and downward, and the accumulated separated oil and
water are finally discharged from the container.
