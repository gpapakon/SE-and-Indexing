<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is predicated upon the discovery by applicants of 
a relationship describing thermal decay of radiation-induced index changes and a 

mechanism which permits stabilization by accelerated aging. Specifically, the 
induced index change decays in proportion to 1/(1 + At
α
) where A and α are 
functions of temperature, and the decay can be accelerated by heat treatment. As a 

consequence, the extent of decay can be determined for arbitrary time and 
temperature and, significantly, an appropriate heat treatment can be scheduled for 

making a device stable within predeterminable limits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical devices and, in particular, to optical
devices employing radiation induced changes in the index of refraction of a glass
medium.The application of high intensity radiation to certain glasses, such as
germanium doped silicate, gamma irradiated silicate, and europium doped glass, is
known to produce a change in the index of refraction in the irradiated region. This
phenomenon has application to a wide variety of optical devices. For example,
interfering beams of ultraviolet light have been used to induce Bragg phase gratings
in optical fibers, and such uv-induced gratings have been employed in fiber lasers,
optical filters, polarization converters, mode converters and fiber sensors. Another
potential application is fabrication of optical memories.An impediment to the deployment of devices containing radiation-induced
index changes is that not much is known concerning their long term
reliability. It is known that the induced index changes diminish with time. But not
enough is known to predict the decay at arbitrary time or temperature. Some
applications, such as fiber lasers for undersea cable, require high tolerances over long
periods of time. Some applications also require operation at elevated temperatures,
posing the additional threat of environmental stress. Accordingly, there is a need for
making such devices of assured reliability.According to the present invention, there is provided
a method as defined in claim 1.The present invention is predicated upon the discovery by applicants of
a relationship describing thermal decay of radiation-induced index changes and a
mechanism which permits stabilization by accelerated aging. Empirically, the
induced index change decays in proportion to 1/(1 + Atα) where A and α are
functions of temperature, and the decay can be accelerated by heat treatment. As a
consequence, the extent of decay can be determined for arbitrary time and
temperature and, significantly, an appropriate heat treatment can be scheduled for
making a device stable within predeterminable limits. In the drawings:
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the steps in making an optical device
having stable uv-induced index changes.FIG. 2 is a schematic view of an exemplary optical device employing
uv-induced index changes comprising a fiber optic laser;FIG. 3 is a graphical display showing the decay of uv-induced index
changes as a function of time; andFIG. 4 plots the time at various temperatures required for aging an
exemplary glass.This description is divided into three
