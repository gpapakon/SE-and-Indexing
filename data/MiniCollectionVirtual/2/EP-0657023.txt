<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a clinical thermometer which registers the maximum temperatur reached and which uses as the thermometric fluid (14) a Ga-alloy eutectic mixture which is non-toxic and adheres strongly to the walls of the thermometer capillary (13), these adhesive forces being greater than the internal cohesive forces within the liquid (14). The maximum temperature can therefore be registered without the need for the Hicks constriction used in prior art clinical thermometers, thus facilitating the manufacture and use of the thermometer. Moreover the invention concerns a Ga-In-Sn alloy which can be used not only in clinical thermometers bu also, for example, as lubricant or antifriction agent.

<CLAIMS>
Clinical thermometer which registers the maximum temperature 
reached with a bulb (11) and a measuring tube (13) 

containing a liquid (14), characterized in that the 
liquid (14) is a eutectic alloy containing gallium in a 

concentration of 65 - 95 wt.-%, indium in a concentration 
of 5 - 22 wt.-% and tin in a concentration of 0 - 11 

wt.-%. 
Clinical thermometer according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the alloy contains up to 2 wt.-% bismuth and up 

to 2 wt.-% antimony. 
Clinical thermometer according to claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the surface of the measuring tube (13) 

in contact with the liquid (14) has a water coat, forming 
a thin gallium oxide layer. 
Clinical thermometer according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the water coat is smaller than the permanent water 

coat. 
Clinical thermometer according to one of the claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the measuring tube (13) has a 

non-circular preferably flat-oval or crescent-shaped 
cross-section and is connected to the bulb (11) via an 

area (12) with a circular cross-section. 
Clinical thermometer according to one of the claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the measuring tube (13) is enclosed 

in a glass housing (10) provided with a grip element 
which is formed by several glass mass areas (16) 

melted onto the glass housing (10).  
 
Clinical thermometer according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the melted-on glass mass areas (16) are arranged 

in the form of at least one ring around the housing (10). 
Eutectic mixture containing 68 - 69 wt.-% gallium, 21 - 
22 wt.-% indium and 9.5 - 10.5 wt.-% tin. 
Eutectic mixture according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the degree of impurity, e.g. lead or zinc, is smaller 

than 0.001 wt.-% , preferably smaller than 0.0001 
wt.-%. 
Use of the eutectic mixture according to claims 8 or 9 as 
a lubricant especially for vacuum, high-vacuum or ultrahigh 

vacuum applications.
