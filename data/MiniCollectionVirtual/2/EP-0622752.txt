<ABSTRACT>
In a neural network-based character processor, a 
neural network identifies characters to be included in 

textual material using a lexicon to improve recognition 
performance. Using the vector confidence level quantities 

associated with characters from the neural network, lexicon 
entries are searched using a selected number of most likely 

characters at character positions in the lexicon entries 
associated with the character positions of the neural 

network word. As a result of this search for a 
predetermined number of character positions, a candidate 

word list is established along with the vector quantities 
defining the confidence level of the character being 

correct. At character positions following the 
predetermined number of character positions, the candidate 

list and not the lexicon is searched, the candidate list 
being shortened by a limited coincidence between the most 

likely characters of the neural network work and the 
characters of the lexicon words. When the neural network 

word has been completely processed, then, in the absence of 
any candidate words, the neural network word is selected. 

Similarly, when the neural network word is in the candidate 
list, then the neural network word is selected. Finally, 

only when the best candidate from the candidate list has a 
sufficiently high total confidence level, relative to the 

neural network word, of being correct is the candidate list 
word selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the 
processing of character information derived from a 
neural network such as an optical character recognition 
system and, more particularly, to a technique for 
improving the accuracy of the word selected by the 
post-processing of the character information for 
inclusion in the resulting text materials. In the related art, a lexical post-processing 
technique has been used to improve the performance of 
optical character recognition procedures. Referring to 
Fig. 1, a neural network 11, such as an optical 
character recognition device, provides a series of 
character activation vectors to the processing unit 12. 
Each character activation vector includes (numerical) 
confidence level fields on the relative confidence 
levels of the identity of the character associated with 
each vector field supplied by the neural network. The 
processing unit 12 can be a general or a special 
purpose computer with appropriate hardware and 
associated software (including firmware) programs to 
process and to manipulate the character activation 
vectors and to process entries from associated memories 
in accordance with currently executing software 
programs. Based on the character activation vectors, 
the processing unit compares the sequence of 
characters, character by character from the neural 
network, with words stored in a lexicon 13. The 
lexicon can be, for example, a group of words used for 
the spell checking operation in word processing  
 
procedures and can be stored in a memory unit to which 
the processing unit has access. Various algorithms 
have been developed which correct for neural network 
errors such as substitutions, insertions, and 
deletions. As a result of the comparison between the 
character activation vectors and the lexicon entries, a 
best match character group or word is found between the 
stored entries in the lexicon and the character 
sequence identified by the neural network. The best 
match character group is transferred to the 
storage/display unit 14 where the character group 
becomes part of the text material which is the output 
of the system. A problem with this procedure for identifying 
the best match character group is that when the input 
character group is not in the lexicon, the system will 
incorrectly select the closest match in the lexicon 
without determining whether the most probable word as 
determined by the character group vectors from the 
neural network is the best selection. A need has been felt for a procedure whereby 
a
