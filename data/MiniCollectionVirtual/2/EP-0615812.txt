<ABSTRACT>
A so-called left-hand or angled stop for the workpiece, as used in particular in circular sizing saws, has a stop rail on which a first stop flap, pivotable from a rest position into an operating position, is mounted in a longitudinally displaceable but lockable manner and is connected to a measuring and indicating unit determining and indicating the position of the stop flap relative to the stop rail. Furthermore, a bar carrying a second stop flap at its free end is guided in the stop rail in such a way that it can be extended and retracted telescopically. A releasable coupling is provided between the measuring and indicating unit, connected to the first stop flap, and the bar so that the measuring range of the measuring and indicating unit can be varied in a simple manner without the disadvantages of hitherto known measuring-range angled stops having to be tolerated.

Angled stop for machine tools, particularly panel 
saws, comprising a stop bar (2), on which is mounted a 

first stop flap (4) so as to be longitudinally 
displaceable but lockable in position, and which is 

connected to a measuring and indicating unit (10) which 
detects and indicates the relative position of the stop 

flap relative to the stop bar, the stop bar being 
telescopically extractably and retractably guided a bar 

(12) which carries at its free end a second stop flap 
(6), characterised in that a coupling (38), which is 

releasably situated on the measuring and indicating unit 
(10) connects the bar (12) to the measuring and 

indicating unit (10). 
Angled stop according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the coupling (38) comprises a retaining bolt (46) 

which is movable transversely to the longitudinal axis of 
the bar (12) and may be inserted into a bore in the bar 

(12). 
Angled stop according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that, on engagement of the coupling (38), the 

measuring range of the measuring and indicating unit (10) 
is switched over to the second stop flap (6). 
Angled stop according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the connection between the first stop flap (4) and 

the measuring and indicating unit (10) is releasable. 
Angled stop according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bar (12) with the 

second stop flap (6) may be locked relative to the stop 
bar (2).  

 
Angled stop according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a third stop flap (8), which is 

longitudinally displaceable on and lockable with respect 
to the stop bar (2) and is also connectable to the 

measuring and indicating unit (10). 
Angled stop according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the coupling (38) comprises a drag stop (40) 

responsive only to pressure on whose contact the third 
stop flap (8) has a defined spacing from the first stop 

flap (4). 
Angled stop according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the drag stop (40) is adjustable. 
Angled stop according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the stop flaps (4, 8, 6) 

are, in a manner known per se, tiltable from an active 
position to a non-active position and their tilting 

switches over the measuring range of the measuring and 
indicating unit (10). 
Angled stop according to claim 7 or 8, characterised 
in that when the drag stop (40) is in engagement the 

measuring range of the measuring and indicating unit (10) 
is switched over to the third stop flap (8).
