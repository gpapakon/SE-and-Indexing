<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a 6-fluoro-7-substituted quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative represented by general formula (4) 
(wherein R₁ represents alkyl; R₂ represents hydrogen, halogen or alkoxy; X represents -CH₂-, -NR₄- or -O-; R₄ represents 

hydrogen or alkyl; Y represents hydrogen, amino or alkylamino; and n represents 0 or 1), characterized by conducting thermal 
condensation of a 6-fluoroquinolonecarboxylic acid derivative represented by general formula (1) (wherein R₁ and R₂ 

are as defined above; and R₃ represents a group capable of nucleophilic substitution), with a substituted saturated heterocyclic 
amine represented by general formula (2) (wherein X, Y and n are as defined above; and R₄ represents hydrogen or 

alkyl), in the presence of an alkyl borate represented by the general formula (3): B(OR₅)₃ wherein R₅ represents alkyl, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method of 
producing a quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative represented 
by the following general formula (4): 
   wherein R₁ represents a lower alkyl group or a cyclo 
lower alkyl group; R₂ represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen 
atom or a lower alkoxy group; X represents -CH₂-, -NR₄-, or 
-O-; R₄ represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; 
Y represents a hydrogen atom, an amino group or a lower 
alkylamino group bonded to an optional carbon atom on a 
saturated heterocycle, or a group capable of easily being 
converted to said amino group or said lower alkylamino group 
according to a chemical means; and n represents 0 or 1. The 6-fluoro-7-substituted quinolonecarboxylic acid 
derivative represented by the general formula (4) is a 
compound useful as a raw material of a medicine to be used 
as an anti-fungus agent and its synthesis intermediate.  Generally, as a method of producing said compound 
can be mentioned a method comprising introducing a specific 
substituent to the desired position of a benzene ring 
first and then forming a quinolone skeleton, and a method 
comprising introducing a substituent to be a specific 
precursor to a desired position first, forming a quinolone 
ring and then converting the substituent to be a precursor 
to a specific substituent. In the case of the former, it lacks selectivity to 
introduce a specific substituent to a desired position and 
hence it has too many problems to be industrially useful. 
In the case of the latter, since the selectivity of a 
position and the reactivity in substitution increase due to 
the ring closure of a quinolone ring, it is relatively easy 
to introduce a specific substituent to a desired position. In the following condensation reaction from the 
general formula (1) to the general formula (4), there have 
been difficulties for industrial production regarding the 
7-alkylamination of introducing a specific substituent as 
below. 
   wherein R₁ represents a lower alkyl group or a cyclo 
lower alkyl group; R₂ represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen 
atom or a lower alkoxy group; R₃ represents an optional, 
functional residue capable of participating in a nucleophilic 
substitution; X represents -CH₂-, -NR₄- or -O-; R₄ represents 
a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; Y represents a 
hydrogen atom, an amino group or a lower alkylamino group 
bonded to an optional carbon atom on a saturated heterocycle, 
or a group capable of easily being converted to an amino 
group or a lower alkylamino
