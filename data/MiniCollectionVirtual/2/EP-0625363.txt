<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a golf ball having excellent (soft) 
hit feeling and excellent durability, which is suitable for 

using on the driving range. The golf ball has a two-layer 
structure comprising a core and a cover for coating the 

core.The compressive strain of the core is 2.8 to 3.8 mm. 
The hardness distribution of the core (measured by a JIS-C 

type hardness tester) is adjusted to 65 to 79 at the 
center, 70 to 80 at the location which is 5 mm away from 

the center to the surface, 73 to 80 at the location which 
is 10 mm away from the center to the surface, 75 to 82 at 

the location which is 15 mm away from the center to the 
surface and 70 to 85 at the surface, and a difference in 

hardness between adjacent locations of measurement is 
within 5. The cover comprises an ionomer resin as the main 

material the stiffness of the cover is 1400 to 3000 
kg/cmÂ². The ball compression is 70 to 100 (PGA system).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf ball
having a two-layer structure comprising a core and a cover
for covering the core (two-piece golf ball), which is
particularly suitable for using in driving ranges.Heretofore, a one-piece golf ball has exclusively
been used as golf balls used in driving ranges in
consideration of durability. However, problems associated
therewith include that the one-piece golf ball is extremely
inferior in flight performances and hit feeling in comparison
with golf ball used for rounds of golf.Of course, a golfer would prefer to use
the golf ball as used for rounds of golf at driving ranges.
A thread wound golf ball (a golf ball obtained by winding a
thread rubber on a center and covering the resulting thread
rubber layer with a cover) is extremely superior in hit
feeling, but is however extremely inferior in durability,
and furthermore is expensive. Therefore, the thread wound
golf ball is not suitable for a golf ball for use at driving
ranges.Further, a golf ball which is used for a round of
golf having a two-piece structure in which a solid core is
covered with a cover is too rigid for repetitive hitting and, 
therefore, normal practice can not be conducted.
Therefore, this golf ball is not also suitable for use at
driving ranges.Therefore, a trial of softening the core of a
golf ball to cushion the shock upon hitting has been conducted.
However, even when the core is softened, the durability of
the ball becomes inferior because of a large difference in
hardness between the cover and the core. Therefore, this
ball is not also suitable for practical use.As described above, a conventional golf ball for
practice at driving ranges is inferior in flight performances
and hit feeling in comparison with a golf ball for a round of
golf whereas, the golf ball for the round of golf is inferior
in durability and is too rigid for repetitive hitting.
Therefore, they are not suitable as golf balls to be used
at driving ranges.JP-A-60090575 discloses a two-piece golf ball
according to the preamble of claim 1, which golf ball has a
hardness distribution which is within the ranges described in
the characterising portion of claim 1.
EP-A-0589647 also discloses a two-piece golf ball and
is comprised in the state of the art by virtue of
Article 54(3) EPC.The main object of the present invention is to
provide a golf ball having excellent hit feeling and
durability, which is particularly suitable for using
as a golf ball for use at driving ranges.These objects as well as other objects and
