<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing a natural-bristle broom 
head and to a broom thus obtained; the process comprises an 

automatic production line in which multiple semifinished 
heads (2), provided with containment sides, are prepared 

upstream, said heads (2) being orientated so that their 
bristle containment surface faces upwards, in order to 

receive, after being filled with glue (9), a mass of 
bristles (3) in tufts which are preliminarily uniformly 

distributed inside overlying templates (10), said templates 
(10) being subsequently removed once the glue has set (9), 

obtaining a finished head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
manufacturing a natural-bristle broom head and to a broom 
thus obtained. The invention is particularly but not exclusively used 
in the field of equipment for the predominantly manual 
cleaning of enclosed spaces. Brooms are known in the current state of the art. 
Originally the broom could be composed of an operating 
handle, generally made of wood, and of a bundle of plant 
fibers which was rigidly coupled to the end of said handle. 
A kind of broom based on the above described system is still 
used extensively nowadays, with particular reference to the 
traditional sorghum broom. This broom also uses plant fibers 
but, differently from the preceding ones, it can use an 
appropriate support or sheath for the fibers, now made of 
plastics, on which the end of a handle can also be engaged. 
Since in this case the sorghum bundle is very long with 
respect to a normal broom, it is stitched several times 
transversely and anchored according to empirical techniques 
to the plastic support by means of staples or similar 
stitchings and other more or less valid systems. While the previously described type of broom is in 
limited use, since it is meant for roughly finished surfaces 
that are particularly affected by dirt and in any case for 
work in which it is frequently in contact with liquids, the 
conventional broom is more common: to be clear, this is the 
broom that we use every day to clean surfaces for example in 
houses and offices. This second generation of broom has  
 
evolved considerably not only in its aesthetics but also in 
some components such as the handle and the supporting head, 
while the surface meant to collect dust has instead been 
neglected. More specifically, this broom is composed of a 
handle which is fixed or telescopically extendable and is 
provided with an adjustment and locking ring as well as with 
a supporting head for the bristles, which are exclusively 
synthetic. The structure of the semifinished head generally 
has a substantially rectangular shape with rounded edges; on 
one side it is flat, and on the other side it has a 
protruding bush inside which it is possible to coaxially 
insert the end of a handle, providing the necessary 
connection. Currently, in a typical process for the 
automatic manufacture of finished heads the semifinished 
heads advance on a same plane along an advancement line to 
undergo first of all a drilling step, which affects the 
entire flat surface thereof that lies opposite to the 
connection,

Process for manufacturing a natural-bristle broom 
head and broom thus obtained, characterized in that a 

production cycle requires the upstream preparation of 
multiple supports, said supports, covered with glue, being 

suitable to receive, by virtue of collection and 
distribution means, a mass of bristles in tufts which are 

preliminarily uniformly distributed inside said supports, 
which are subsequently removed once the glue has set, 

obtaining finished products. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the supports for the bristles consist of semifinished heads 

provided with containment sides, said heads being orientated 
so that their bristle containment surface lies upwards, in 

order to receive, after being filled with glue, a mass of 
bristles in tufts, said bristles being initially uniformly 

distributed inside overlying templates, said templates being 
then removed once the glue has set, thus obtaining a 

finished head. 
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that a line for processing the heads (2) and a line for 

feeding the bristles (3) are arranged so that they are 
logically coordinated and interacting; wherein a cycle 

consists in: 

subjecting, in the first line, multiple overturned 
semifinished heads (2) arranged on a same plane beforehand 

to a step for filling each head with glue (9) which is 
maintained below the rim of said head (2), and in then 

preparing for a step for receiving the bristles (3); 
while in the second line the bristles (3) are 
inserted vertically and randomly inside a series of 

vibrating templates (10) which subsequently affect said 
heads (2) by being moved simultaneously; 
and finally, providing a step for receiving the 
bristles (3), wherein the templates (10) are raised and 

placed above the heads (2'), embedding the ends (3') of the 
bristles (3) in the underlying glue (9), until said glue has 

set, said templates being then removed and returned upstream 
of a production cycle. 
Process and broom according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the head (2) has, on one side, a bush 

(4) for connection to the handle (1), whereas on the 
opposite side it is perimetrically provided with a 

containment side (5) which rises from a substantially flat 
base (6). 
Process and broom according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said containment side (5) is not 

perpendicular to the base (6) of said head (2), and wherein 
slots (7, 8) are formed on said base (6), the cross-section 

of said slots resembling a dovetail seat. 
Process and broom according to claim 5, 
characterized in that a slot (8) with non-perpendicular 

walls (8') at least partially forms a dovetail-like shape 
but in this case, by affecting the parallel slots (7), 

extends in a ring-like shape and is proximate to the base 
perimeter of the connecting bush (4). 
Process according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each template (10) is essentially 

constituted by a box-like structure which has containment 
 

sides and a base (10') on which multiple holes (10'') are 
formed over the entire surface. 
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the arrangement and configuration of the rows of holes (10'') 

is such that diagonal holes are arranged perimetrically with 
respect to the base (10') and are substantially distributed 

concentrically, the inclination angle of said holes 
decreasing gradually from the outside towards the inside of 

the base (10') until perpendicular holes are obtained 
centrally with respect to the base. 
Process according to claims 7 and 8, characterized 
in that along the inner surface, the sides of a template 

(10) can have adjacent and perpendicular grooves (11). 
Process according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that once the loose bristles (3) have been 

inserted in the templates (10), said templates are vibrated 
in a particular manner, allowing clustering into tufts and 

uniform distribution in bundles of bristles (3) which pass 
through, and are retained in, the holes (10''). 
Process according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said templates (10), by being raised, 

allow each group of bristles (3) to protrude with its lower 
end (3') beyond the base (10') of said template, this 

protrusion matching at least the height of the containment 
sides of a head (2). 
Broom according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it is composed of a handle (1) and of 

a head (2) below which natural bristles (3) are associated, 
said bristles being of the type obtained from an animal.
