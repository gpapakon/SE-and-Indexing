<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns an oral contraceptive 
containing, in combination, oestradiol valerate and cyproterone 

acetate, as well as at least one pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier and optionally further adjuvants. The 

invention also concerns a method of contraception. According 
to a preferred embodiment, in a treatment cycle of 28 

days, during a first period a) of 10 days a contraceptive 
is given containing 1 mg each of oestradiol valerate and 

cyproterone acetate, during a subsequent period b) of 11 
days a contraceptive is given containing twice the amount 

of both said hormones. This period b) is followed by a 7 
day period c) of no hormone administration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination contraceptive 
for oral use, to a method of contraception, as well 
as to a package assembly or package kit for use in the said 
method. Development of oral contraceptives containing natural 
estrogens for women over 35, which are no longer in need of 
a very potent method of contraception, is most desirable. 
Such women are no longer very fertile, approximately only 
60 % of women at the age of 40 having the capability of 
becoming pregnant, the number decreasing to 20 % at the age 
of 45. Still such women need some form of protection and 
preferably in a form without the adverse side-effects 
usually connected with combination oral contraceptives. It 
is generally accepted that the ethinyl oestradiol component 
used in current oral contraceptives is the major cause of 
thromboembolism, whereas progestogens are associated with 
arterial cardiovascular complications. Both problems tend 
to increase with age. Thus there is a clear need for a non-invasive 
contraceptive. Natural 17β-oestradiol (E2) is widely used in post-menopausal 
replacement therapy without any serious side effects, 
although its use in oral contraceptives has not been 
successful because of high incidents of irregular bleeding. 
Of the 17α-hydroxyprogesteron derivatives available, 
only cyproterone acetate is widely used in oral contraceptives. According to the invention an oral contraceptive has now 
been developed which is especially suited for women over 
the age of 35 up to menopause, the contraceptive containing, 
in combination, a natural 17β-oestradiol in the 
form of oestradiol valerate, and cyproterone acetate, as  
 
well as at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier 
and optionally further adjuvants. Preferably the preparation contains equal amounts of 
oestradiol valerate and cyproterone acetate. The invention also concerns a method of contraception 
comprising administering to a female subject in need 
thereof, an oral contraceptive preparation containing, in 
combination, oestradiol valerate and cyproterone acetate, 
according to the following regime 
administering daily during a first period a) of a 
cycle of 28 days, a preparation containing an effective 
amount, preferably 1 - 2 mg each of oestradiol valerate 
and cyproterone acetate, subsequently administering daily during a second period b) of the 
said cycle, a preparation corresponding to that administered 
during the first period a), or a preparation 
containing different, but effective amounts of oestradiol 
va
