<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polyhydroxyphenol
derivatives, salts thereof, and medicinal compositions
containing the same which have been developed for the
purpose of being used for preventive and therapeutic
osteolytic diseases such as, for example, malignant
hypercalcemia, Paget's disease, and osteoporosis and
diseases accompanying chondral degeneration and necrosis
such as, for example, osteoarthritis apt to attack knees,
shoulders, and hip joints, femoral head necrosis, and
rheumatoid arthritis.EP-A-721 929 discloses a process for the preparation of
series of hydroxy-alkoxybenzophenones,
US-A-5,118,859 discloses, as starting materials for a
process, compounds of general formula (II) of the present
invention
GB-A-1 374 925 discloses a series of dihydroxyphenyl-benzyl
ketone derivatives.Japan has been plunging into such an aging society
as has never existed to date and has come to encounter
the spread of such osteolytic diseases as osteoporosity
as a serious social issue. The term "osteolytic disease"
means diseases of bones induced by abnormal aggravation
of osteolysis such as, for example, malignant hypercalcemia
causes by myeloma and lymphoma, Paget's disease 
caused by local osteolysis, and osteoporosis caused by
various factors like aging and menopause. The growth in
the number 
of aged persons laid up in bed on account of bone fractures
which originate in such osteolytic diseases ultimately
results in a huge addition to the national medical expenses.
At present, vitamin D preparation, calcitonin preparation,
and ipriflavone preparation are being used for the therapy
of these diseases. The treatment with these medicines
allows no radical cure but barely serves as a symptomatic
measure. The osteoarthritis, femoral head necrosis, and
rheumatoid arthritis form a group of diseases which occur
when the articular cartilage and cartilaginified bone are
aggravated until degeneration and necrosis by various
factors such as, for example, mechanical stress, aging, and
inflammation and ultimately suffered to induce defects of
bones and cartilages. These chondral defects, by deforming
joints and causing pains therein, have a conspicuous effect
in the degradation of the quality of daily life of the
affected persons. Though the diseases of this category are
being treated with hyaluronic acid, anti-inflammatory agent,
and analgesic agent, a medicine which is capable of
effectively inhibiting or curing chondral defects has not
yet been developed.The object of this invention, therefore, is to improve
the
