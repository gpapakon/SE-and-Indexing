<ABSTRACT>
Intra-aortic catheter for renal perfusion and conservation, which comprises a series of lumen which communicate with each other: with a permeable region (B) which has a multiplicity of orifices; with a series of sensors (S) having a termination in the parafilar zone of the kidney; as before; with two balloons: distal (D) and proximal (P); and, optionally, another lumen which permits the introduction of a guide (A) for the positioning of the catheter; all these terminations are followed by monitoring for measuring and recording various parameters of the zone and to cause the balloons to inflate at a given moment so that when the death of the donor occurs, the kidneys remain isolated and it is possible to supply them with renal perfusion fluid.

A device for renal perfusion and conservation
comprising an intra-aortic catheter formed by a tube

comprising a series of vias terminating in different
points along the former, characterised in that the

catheter comprises the following paths: a first path (b)
communicating with a permeable region (B); said region has

numerous holes and occupies an intermediate zone of the
catheter and which, once the catheter is implanted,

remains located in the renal para-filiform region; a
second path for a sensing device(s), likewise terminating

in the para-filiform region; a complementary path
terminating in the end of the catheter and which permits

the introduction of a metallic guide through it to fit it
following the percutaneous method; a third path called

distal (d), considering the term distal in relation to the
direction of blood flow in the aorta, which communicates

with the balloon (D) located in the distal or caudal part
of the catheter and capable of obstructing the flow in the

aorta by inflating; and a fourth path called proximal (p),
communicating directly with a proximal balloon (P) located

at the end of the catheter and which is implanted above
the renal arteries and at a diameter such that on

inflating, it also completely obstructs the aortic flow;
and in that the device comprises a monitoring equipment to

which the available terminations or paths are connected,
said monitoring equipment comprises: (1) an

electrocardiograph incorporated to the equipment or
independent monitor itself, (2) an haemo-dynamic and

biochemical group, connected to a series of sensing
device(s) which determine the blood pressure and

temperature as well as the means to extract through the
first path (b), communicating with the permeable region, a

small blood sample, with which the gasometry, a series of 
haematological and biochemical parameters, is determined,

and with a difference compared with other biochemical and
pharmacological determinations of interest, (3) a group

connected to the proximal and distal paths (p,d), which
regulate and inflate the balloons, producing the inflating

of the distal balloon when it detects a renal parafiliform
pressure reduction or a reversible cardiac

standstill, whilst the inflating of the proximal balloon
is produced when an irreversible cardiac standstill

occurs; 4) a group of perfusion pumps connected to the
termination finishing in the permeable zone, permitting

the transfusion of liquid directly to the kidneys when the
patient is still living and which serves, once there is an

irreversible cardiac standstill and the two balloons are
inflated, for the transfusion of the conservation liquid

in the two kidneys and which comprises an exsanguination
system synchronised with this perfusion pump and (5)

recording means on a computerised support of all the
monitoring variations at the renal hilium level.
