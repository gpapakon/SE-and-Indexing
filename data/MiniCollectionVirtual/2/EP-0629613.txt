<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel onium 
salt having a specific structure, a photopolymerization 
initiator containing the same as an active ingredient, 
an energy ray-curing composition containing the 
initiator and curable by irradiation with energy rays, 
and a cured product. Photopolymerizable compositions have been 
intensively studied at the request for energy-saving, 
space-saving and prevention of environmental pollution 
in the fields of printing inks, paints, coatings, liquid 
resist inks, etc. and it has been attempted to put them 
to practical use. However, most of these studies are 
based on radical polymerization reaction of double bond. 
Cation polymerizable substances such as epoxy resins are 
excellent in properties, but are difficult to 
photopolymerize. Thus, hitherto, such substances having 
a double bond introduced by acrylic modification have 
been mainly used. As a method for curing epoxy resins by 
exposure to light, for example, U.S. Pat. No.3794576 
proposes to use photosensitive aromatic diazonium salts 
as a photopolymerization initiator. However, aromatic  
 
diazonium salts generate nitrogen gas upon decomposition 
with light, and if the thickness of epoxy resin coat is 
more than 15 µ, the coat foams and therefore, the 
initiator is not suitable for the use of thick coating. 
Further, the mixture with an epoxy resin gradually cures 
even in the absence of light and thus has the problem in 
storage stability and cannot be used as one-pack type 
compositions. Various studies have been made in an attempt 
to solve the defects of the diazonium salt photopolymerization 
initiators and as a result, aromatic 
sulfonium salt or aromatic iodonium salt initiators and 
curable resin compositions containing the same are 
reported to improve the thick coatability and the 
storage stability in JP-B-52 14278 and JP-B-52 14277, 
USP 4161478 and USP 4273668. However, the compositions 
containing these aromatic onium salts are inferior in 
curability as compared with those containing diazonium 
salts. Further, aromatic sulfonium salts have the 
problem in the smell of cured products. For solving 
these problems, use of aromatic sulfonium salts having a 
specific group is proposed in USP 4374066. However, the 
problems have not yet been sufficiently solved. 
Moreover, with expansion of the field where photopolymerizable 
compositions are used, development of 
novel photopolymerization initiators and compositions 
containing the same is important for meeting the 
market's demand.
