<ABSTRACT>
A phospholipid mixture in which the biological and pharmacological properties are maintained but from which unconventional viruses causing e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy are selectively eliminated may be prepared by extraction of phospholipids from bovine brain by a mixture of organic solvents of which one is a chlorinated hydrocarbon or by silica gel chromatography with elution with a succession of eluents consisting of chloroform, lower alcohols and water, or by a combination of extraction and silica gel chromatography. Purified phospholipids can be used in pharmaceutical compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process 
for the preparation of phospholipid mixtures 
which selectively eliminates contaminants associated 
with potentially pathogenic unconventional 
viruses, without altering the biological and 
pharmacological characteristics of the mixture. Extracts from bovine brain have been used as 
therapeutic agents for many years. Of such 
extracts, purified phospholipids represent the  
 
active principle of a large number of 
pharmacological specialties. Experimental and 
clinical documentation of the pharmacological 
properties of phospholipids have been available 
for many years (Bruni A. et al., Nature 260, 
331, 1976; Hirata F. et al., Nature 275, 219, 
1978; Delwaide P.J. et al., Acta Neurol. Scand. 
73, 136, 1986). It has long been known that it is possible 
to extract, at research level, mixtures of 
phospholipids (which have not yet been fully 
characterized) (J. Folch, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 
226: 497, 1957; N. Radin, Methods Enzymol. 72: 5, 
1981; E.G. Bligh, Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 37: 
911, 1959), but none of the aforesaid methods was 
developed with a view to demonstrating the 
elimination and destruction of components 
associated with unconventional viruses. One 
reason therefor is that at the time the above 
mentioned procedure was found such diseases 
caused by unconventional viruses were not known 
to affect the mammalian species whose brains were 
used for extraction. Another reason is that no 
available method for the identification of 
potentially dangerous components was available. 
Pathological conditions may sometimes occur where 
the pathogenic agent or agents have not been 
identified. One such pathology, called bovine  
 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was first 
reported in England in 1986 (Wells G. et al. Vet. 
Record, 419, 1987). The disease is so called because of the 
spongy appearance of the brain tissue of affected 
animals when observed under a microscope; the 
main lesions are constituted by extensive 
intraneuronal vacuolation. All current evidence indicates that BSE 
belongs to the group of degenerative 
encephalopathies of the central nervous system, 
caused by the family of unconventional, 
transmissible agents whose outcome is invariably 
fatal (Fraser et al., Vet. Record 123: 472, 1988; 
Hope et al., Nature 336: 390, 1988). Such 
diseases include scrapie of sheep and goats, the 
chronic wasting disease (CWD) which affects 
captive mule deer, transmissible mink 
encephalopathy affecting animals on mink ranches, 
and three human
