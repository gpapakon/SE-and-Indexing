<CLAIMS>
Hydraulic brake device, capable of being actuated 
directly or automatically, and comprising at least: 


a master cylinder (1) which is filled with a 
brake fluid which it can dispense on an outlet (1a), and 

which is capable of being controlled by a brake pedal 
(lb) so as to constitute a first source of high hydraulic 

pressure, 
a pump (2) having a suction inlet (2a) and a 
force outlet (2b), this pump being capable of being 

controlled automatically so as to constitute a second 
source of high hydraulic pressure, 
a first pressure receiver (3) adapted to use a 
high pressure so as to bring about the braking of a 

driving wheel, 
a second pressure receiver (4) adapted to use 
a high pressure so as to bring about the braking of a 

non-driving wheel, 
a hydraulic system formed of a network of links 
comprising at least one low pressure link (5) and links 

connecting the outlets of the sources of high pressure to 
the receivers, 
first and second electrovalves (7, 8) installed 
on the hydraulic system and associated with the first and 

second receivers respectively, each of them being capable 
of being controlled so as to connect the corresponding 

receiver selectively to the low pressure or to a source 
of high pressure, and 
a distributor (9) also installed on the 
hydraulic system so as to modify the network of links in 

accordance with instructions received by this 
distributor, this distributor (9) comprising a body (10) 

pierced with a bore (10a) and a slide valve (11) capable 
of moving in the bore in an axial direction between two 

extreme positions under the control of the pressure of at 
least one source of high pressure, so as selectively to 

connect the outlet (1a) of the master cylinder and the 
inlet (2a) of the pump, 
 
   characterized in that the slide valve (11) is  

 
capable of moving in the bore between a neutral position 

and each of the two extreme positions located on either 
side of the neutral position, the slide valve moving 

towards the first and second extreme positions, against 
respective first and second resilient forces, under the 

effect of a pressure rise in respective first and second 
chambers (15, 16) of the distributor, connected to the 

respective outlets (1a, 2b) of the first and second 
pressure sources (1, 2), in that the slide valve (11), in 

the first extreme position, interrupts a link, established 
for the other positions of the slide valve, 

between the outlet (1a) of the master cylinder and the 
inlet (2a) of the pump and in that the slide valve (11), 

in the second extreme position, interrupts a link, 
established for the other positions of the slide valve, 

between the outlet (1a) of the master cylinder and the 
first receiver (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the first 
force is of a resilient nature, characterized in that the 

second chamber (16) is partly formed by a bore of the 
slide valve, in which slides a piston (19) pushed towards 

the outside of the bore by the pressure prevailing in the 
latter, and towards the inside by the first fo
rce, this 
piston opening, after a predetermined outward travel from 

the neutral position, a duct (20, 22) pierced in the 
slide valve and placing the first and second chambers in 

communication, which results in a limitation of the 
output pressure of the pump. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the slide valve (11), in the first extreme position, 

establishes a direct link, interrupted for the other 
positions of the slide valve between the outlet (2b) of 

the pump and the second receiver (4). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that said direct link is established by overlapping of a 

first annular groove (18) forming a radial extension of 
the bore and of a second annular groove (27) hollowed out 

in the slide valve. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that the first groove (18) connects the outlet (2b) of 
the pump permanently to the second chamber (16).
