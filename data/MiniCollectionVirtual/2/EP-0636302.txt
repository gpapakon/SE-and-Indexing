<ABSTRACT>
A method for estimation of global error motion vectors, which represent unwanted global picture instabilities in a picture sequence in digital video signals. The method uses a motion vector estimator with an adaptively variable measuring time distance, as well as spatial processing and temporal processing, in order to estimate a sequence of global motion vectors, from which a sequence of global error motion vectors is separated in order to allow stabilization of a picture sequence in digital video signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a method for estimation of 
global error motion vectors, which represent unwanted global 
picture instabilities in a picture sequence in digital video 
signals. The method uses a number of selected reference 
windows as well as spatial processing (involving calculations 
based on information associated with one picture in the 
picture sequence), motion vector estimators (estimating global 
motion vectors or vector fields associated with complete 
pictures or local motion vectors associated with fractions of 
pictures, whereat, preferrably, a confidence value indicative 
of reliability of the estimation is assigned to every motion 
vector) using a specific measuring time distance (corresponding 
to the time elapsed between two pictures in the picture 
sequence, which are to be compared with regard to individual 
pixels in order to estimate inter-picture displacements 
yielding global or local motion vectors for one of the two 
pictures), as well as temporal processing (involving calculations 
based on information associated with several pictures in 
the picture sequence). This is done in order to estimate a sequence of global motion 
vectors (represented by one two-dimensional motion vector per 
picture), from which a sequence of global error motion vectors 
(associated with the unwanted global picture instabilities and 
represented by one two-dimensional motion vector per picture) 
is separated. The sequence of global error motion vectors may 
be used for compensation of the unwanted picture instabilities 
to allow production of stabilized picture sequences. Due to 
e.g. bending and stretch of film originals the global motion 
vector may also be corrected locally within a picture in order 
to minimize picture distortion.  
 In general, motion in a picture sequence is a combination of 
object motion (associated with moving objects) and global 
motion. The global motion is a combination of true global 
motion (such as pan and zoom) and unwanted global picture instabilities 
resulting from, e.g., worn-out film sprocket 
holes, poorly performing telecine (device used in transfer of 
film to video), linear or non-linear stretch of film original 
during printing or copying, or unsteady camera shots. The true 
global motion, and the unwanted global picture instabilities 
may vary in amplitude and frequency. The variation in the 
amplitude may range from small to large (compared to picture 
spatial resolution) and the variation in the frequency may 
range from low to high

<CLAIMS>
A method for estimation of global error motion vectors, 
which represent unwanted global picture instabilities in an 

input picture sequence (101) in digital video signals, by 
using a motion vector estimator (102) with a specific measuring 

time distance (21) between pictures in said picture 
sequence, as well as spatial processing and temporal processing, 

in order to estimate a sequence of global motion 
vectors (109), from which a sequence of global error motion 

vectors (115) is separated, 
characterized
 in that 
said measuring time distance (21) used in the motion vector 

estimator is adjusted in response to a maximum length of said 
global motion vectors (30) and to a global motion vector frequency, 

within a specific interval of the picture sequence (1), said 
measuring time distance (21) being increased in case only 

small global motion vectors and low global motion vector 
frequency are present and being decreased in case large global 

motion vectors are present and in case a high global motion 
vector frequency is present. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein said measuring time 
distance (21) is used in said motion vector estimator (102), 

when employing a fixed measuring cycle, for which a referred 
current picture is compared to a number of following pictures 

within the measuring time distance (21), said measuring cycle 
being followed by another measuring cycle referring to another 

current picture, which is separated from the previous current 
picture by a distance forward in time, corresponding to said 

measuring time distance (21). 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein information about 
the origin of said picture sequence is used, as well, in 

determination of said measuring time distance (21). 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the motion vector 
estimator (102) uses at least one selected reference window  

 
(33, 34) for estimating inter-picture motion with sub-pixel 

resolution. 
A method as defined in claim 4, wherein sub-pixel resolution 
is achieved in the motion estimator by up-sampling of 

said at least one reference window. 
A method as defined in claim 4, wherein more than one 
selected reference window is used and wherein the sequence of 

global motion vectors (109) is corrected by interpolating 
motion vectors locally within a picture in order to compensate 

for stretch or bending within the picture. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein a sequence of 
global motion vectors (109) is processed by a temporal 

processor to separate global error motion vectors (115) from 
said global motion vectors (109), thus resulting in a sequence 

of said global error motion vectors (115) associated with said 
picture sequence (101). 
A method as defined in claim 7, wherein the temporal processor 
is an adaptive motion vector frequency sensitive recursive 

filter using global motion vectors for the picture 
sequence.
