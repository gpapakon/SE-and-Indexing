<ABSTRACT>
A decoder of a coded serial stream of digital data 
in a stream of decoded NRZ data has re-timing (BB, AA) 

flip-flops and a 2x1 multiplexer (MUX OUT) selectably 
providing a single-bit NRZ output stream or a dual-bit 

(NRZ⊘ and NRZ1) output streams by exploiting the pre-decoded 
values (ND⊘ and ND1) produced by two decoding 

combinative logic networks (RC1 and RC2) that compose 
the decoder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to a programmable
decoder for serial data transfer channels, for example
from peripherals to a Central Processing Units (CPU)
and viceversa. The invention is particularly useful for
read/write channels of mass memories, for example hard-disk
systems.In mass data storage supports, as for example hard
disks, floppy disks, CDs, tape streamers and alike,
digital data are stored, in practice, by physically
recording on the support only the logic "1" and by
"spacing" them by "segments" of a recording track, the
length of which is proportional to the number of
logical "0" present between successive "1". Considerations
on the dynamic character typical of rotating
supports or generally of translating supports, impose a
minimum value of the separation distance between
adjacently recorded "1", because if two successive "1"
were to be physically recorded one next to the other on
the support, inevitable interferences between the two
recordings (peaks) detected in reading the data off the
support, could cause uncertainties and errors due to a
practical limitation of the discriminating capabilities
of the reading pick-ups.Another common peculiarity of these mass data
storage systems is represented by the fact that the
sampling clock signal, used in the write/read channels,
cannot be derived from a fixed system's clock, but
necessarily must be a clock signal that is derived or
extracted directly from the incoming serial stream of
data, the speed of which may often vary. For example,
in the case of a hard-disk, data recorded on outer 
tracks may be written and read at a higher linear
speeds than data written and read on inner concentric
tracks.Generally, in this as in other applications, a
variable frequency clock signal, synchronous with the
serial stream of data (pulses), is generated by
detecting transitions in the coded stream of pulses
that represents the succession of digital data, for
example by employing a common phase-locked, ring
circuit (TLL), cooperating with a voltage controlled
oscillator (VCO).Where the need exists for self-generating a
synchronous, variable frequency, clock signal, there
may be a limit to the maximum tolerable "distance"
between any two successively recorded logic "1",
because if successive transitions were to occur after
an excessively long interval of time, synchronism of
the frequency of the self-generated clock signal,
"phase-locked" with the pulse stream, could be
partially lost, thus introducing, also in this case,
conditions of indiscrimination of
