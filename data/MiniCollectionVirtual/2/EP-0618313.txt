<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an equipment with automatic or 
semi-automatic working, suitable to permit the quick 
replacement of the anodes in the electrolytic cells for 
the production of primary aluminium, with a precise and 
quick positioning of the new anodes. As known, the cells for the electrolytic production of 
primary aluminium with pre-baked anodes are equipped 
with a collector plate, constituting the cathode, 
placed on the bottom of the cell, made from graphite or 
the like, while the anode is constituted by a set of 
blocks from carbon-based material, provided with 
"shafts" connected, with the possibility of being 
removed, with a bus-bar (anodic bar). The set of blocks 
or anodes of each cell is dipped in the molten mass of 
the bath at a constant distance from the cathodic plate 
constituted by the surface of liquid aluminium. As - as also is known - the electrolytic process gradually 
wears out the anodes, their frequent replacement 
is necessary, and such replacement requires that the 
base of each new anode comes to be, after the removal 
of the worn anode, at the same distance from the cathode 
as the worn replaced anode had. At present, to replace the anodes, self-propelled 
trucks are used, which operate along the aisle of the 
cells arranged in an "end-to-end" position, or purposely 
equipped bridge cranes which run above the cells  
 
placed in a "side-to-side" position. The limits of these systems consist especially in that 
they require large movement areas (self-propelled 
trucks) or in that, besides this, they require massive 
supporting structures because of their cumbersome mass 
(equipped bridge cranes). According to the prior art, both the use of equipped 
bridge cranes or self-propelled trucks require always 
a full set of surveys and measurements to be carried 
out, which are delicate and exacting, in order to 
position exactly the base of the new anodes. Such 
machines have then a poor flexibility and a low operating 
speed, which contrasts with the high production 
power of the most updated cells and with the high 
degree of automation reached in the control and adjustment 
of said cells. To obviate these drawbacks, both of a practical and 
economic nature, of the above mentioned known systems 
for replacing the anodes, an equipment has already been 
proposed for the mechanized replacement of the anodes, 
such as the one described by patent EP 0298198 (TECHMO 
Car SpA), which is substantially constituted by a 
module capable of allowing the removal of the worn 
anode
