<ABSTRACT>
In a brake testing process for wheeled vehicles (1) including a plurality of drive axles (2, 3) coupled together, each axle (2 or 3) being fitted with a differential (2c, 3c), a wheel (3a) (of an axle (3)) to be tested is driven in the forward movement direction (A), and the other wheel of the same axle (3) is driven in the reversing direction. The speed of the means (7a) for driving the wheel (3a) to be tested and the speed of the means (7b) for driving the other wheel, which is driven in reverse (B), are different. The difference between the two speeds is kept less than a chosen value, in order not to cause movements of another axle (2) of the vehicle (1) outside the braking rig.
