<ABSTRACT>
A boardlock (2) for securely connecting an electrical 
device or connector to a printed circuit board without 

requiring post-soldering thereof, is shown comprising a 
pair of rigid arms (22) joined at the lower end by a 

thinner bridge section (24). The boardlock is a flat 
unitary edge-stamped sheet metal part that is insertable 

through a hole (62) of a printed circuit board such that 
the bridge portion (24) extends below the printed circuit 

board and whereby outer portions (27) thereof, extend 
outwardly of the hole (62) for provisionally holding the 

boardlock to the printed circuit board (60). A die (40) 
comprising an elongate slot (42) of slightly greater 

thickness than the boardlock, can be engaged against the 
bridge portion (24) for permanent plastic deformation 

thereof. The die has a convex bottomed surface (46) in 
order to arc the deformed bridge portion towards the 

printed circuit board in order to enhance the mechanical 
resistance of the boardlock with respect to an upwards 

pulling force thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a boardlock according to the preamble
of claim 1.A multitude of different boardlocks are used in the
electronics industry for securing an electrical connector
or device to a printed circuit board. Some boardlocks are
first securely mounted to a connector, and have resilient
legs extending therebelow that are engageable in a hole of
a printed circuit board for provisionally holding the
connector to the printed circuit board. Examples of such
boardlocks are disclosed in US patents 5108312 and
5115375. The boardlocks serve to provisionally hold the
connector to the printed circuit board during assembly of
other electrical devices. Once the electrical devices are
all assembled to the printed circuit board, the board is
then taken to a soldering station whereby the electrical
connections to the circuit board are permanently soldered
thereon, the resilient legs of the boardlock also
receiving solder thus being permanently and rigidly
secured to the printed circuit board.Other boardlocks such as in US patent 4717219, do not
have resilient legs but instead are inserted through the
printed circuit board and then plastically deformed such
that they can not be extracted. Post-soldering of these
boardlocks is also usually foreseen, because the
boardlocks do not hold the device or connector
sufficiently securely to the printed circuit board. A
further problem with the deformable boardlocks if they
don't have resilient legs, is that they can not
provisionally hold the connector or device to the printed
circuit board during the assembly procedure.From document EP-A1-0 366 964 a connector with a barbed boardlock
has come to be known. Said known boardlock is a unitary edge-stamped
sheet metal part comprising a U-shaped substantially planar and
symmetrical board mounting section and a connector mounting section.
The board mounting section comprises a pair of arms joined at a low
end by a bridge portion, whereby the arms are insertable in a hole in the
printed circuit board and whereby the bridge portion is insertable
through a hole in the printed circuit board. This known boardlock is
fixed by a deformation of the arms.From document EP-A1-0 250 097 an electrical connector for assembly
onto a circuit board has come to be known. This known electrical connector
has an eyelet disposed in an aperture in a mounting flange. The
eyelet is received in an aperture in an interference fit. The eyelet has a
flange engaging the mounting flange of a housing of the connector, an
inverted conical end remote from

printed circuit board (60)


a) where the boardlock (2, 2') is a unitary edge-stamped sheet
metal part comprising a U-shaped substantially planar and

symmetrical board mounting section (6) and a connector
mounting section (4);
b) the board mounting section (6) comprises a pair of arms (22,
22') joined at a lower end by a bridge portion (24),

board (60) prior to deformation of the bridge portion (24); and
h) the bridge portion (24) is permanently deformable such that the
board lock (2, 2') is securely holdable to the board (60)

without requiring post-soldering.
The boardlock of claim 1 characterized in that

a) the bridge portion (24) is deformable into a substantially
