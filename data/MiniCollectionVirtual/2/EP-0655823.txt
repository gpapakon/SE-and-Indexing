<ABSTRACT>
In a brushless DC motor of a radial gap type, one of a pair of vertical (right and left) pole teeth (Xx, Yy) is formed in such 
a manner as to possess a smaller gap in a circumferential direction than the other, and the position of this pole tooth is shifted in 

a rotating direction of a rotor relative to an intermediate position of the other of the pole tooth. Further, a ratio (a/p) of the tooth 
width (a) to the pole pitch (p), a ratio (a/p) of the tooth width (a) to the tooth width (b) and a ratio (c/d) of the pole tooth pitch (c) 

to the pole tooth pitch (d) are stipulated to fall within predetermined ranges so that a start torque can be generated and non-uniformity 
of rotation can be reduced. In such a motor construction, the generation torque frequency of the cogging torque occurring 

between a permanent magnet rotor (2) and a stator is converted to large and small torque waves, and change-over of a current 
of a coil (12) is made at, or near, a position at which an absolute value of a plurality of positive peaks of the cogging torque is 

great. Further, change-over of the coil current is made at, or near, a position at which an excitation current generated by the coil 

current becomes zero. Furthermore, change-over of the coil current is made near the positive peak of the cogging torque, and the 
coil current is changed over at a time in which the feed of the current is interrupted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for driving
brushless DC motors.As shown in Fig. 34 of the accompanying drawings,
a conventional radial gap type brushless DC motor has a
rotor 51 consisting of a cup shaped back yoke 52, an
annular permanent magnet 53 adhered to the inner wall of
the back yoke, and a shaft 55 inserted in a bush 54 at
the center of the back yoke 52. In the drawing, the
reference numeral 56 represents a turn table.A stator 57 consists of first and second stator yokes
58, 59 made of soft magnetic metal plate and a coil 60
disposed between the both stator yokes 58. 59 as shown in
Fig. 35. These stator yokes 58, 59 have claw poles 58a,
59a which are pole pieces radially extending outward from
the center and bent at right angles, and integrally
formed rings 61,62 at the center along the direction in
which the claw poles 58a,59a are bent. In the drawing,
the motor has four poles.The first stator yoke 58 and the second stator yoke 59
of the stator 57 are assembled with the coil 60 
therebetween. A ring 61 and another ring 62 are joined to
be magnetically connected to form a magnetic circuit. And,
keeping a prescribed gap from the circumference of the
permanent magnet 53 of the rotor 51, the claw poles 58a
and the claw poles 59a of the first stator yoke 58 and
the second stator yoke 59 are alternately disposed in the
circumferential direction.Further, a sleeve 63 is mounted within the ring 61 of
the stator 57, and the shaft 55 of the rotor 51 is supported
within the sleeve 63 via a bearing 64. At the bottom of the
sleeve 63, a base plate 65 is fitted to support the stator
57, and a circuit substrate 66 is fixed to the base plate
65. In the drawing, the reference numeral 67 indicates a
Hall element which is a sensor for detecting the magnetic
pole of the rotor, and G indicates a gap.In a conventional brushless DC motor, the width a of
one claw pole Xx is generally the same as the claw pole
width b of the other claw pole Yy as shown in Fig. 36 and
Fig. 37 (a) and the claw pole pitch c from the one claw
pole Xx to the other claw pole Yy is set to be equal to
the claw pole pitch d from the other claw pole Yy to the
one claw pole Xx. In other words, claw poles having
equal claw pole width are
combined at equal intervals. When a torque curve in this
case is drawn (vertical axis: torque T, horizontal axis:
machine angle ), Fig. 37 (b) shows that when a cogging 
torque shown by a solid line (torque due to attraction by
the magnet and stator yoke) reaches point B (unstable point:
mark Δ ) at 180
