<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a coupling for removably 
connecting a conduit for cleaning liquid to a conduit in an 
automatic device for distributing a liquid or semi-liquid 
food product, which coupling comprises a first male 
connection piece with a body provided with a passage to 
which the conduit connects and a female connection piece 
formed by a recipient which is opened at one end, removably 
connecting with its open end in a leak-proof way to the 
body of the male connection piece but surrounding with its 
closed end, with an interval, an extremity of the body of 
the male connection piece on which the passage in this 
connection piece gives, while the recipient is provided in 
its wall and laterally with respect to the passage through 
the body, with an opening for connecting the cleaning 
conduit, which opening gives on said interval. Such couplings can be used with automatic devices for 
distributing soft-ice and the like. During normal operation 
the male connection piece is connected to a reservoir 
containing a liquid composition to connect the automatic 
device conduit to the reservoir. The composition is pumped 
from the reservoir, eventually whipped with air and cooled 
in a cooling element. A coupling of this kind is disclosed in CH-A-400.047. The 
body of the male connection piece is formed by the 
dispensing tube of a whipped cream dispenser, the lower end 
of which tube is always open. Rests of food products 
possibly contained in the tube can drop down when the 
dispensing tube, removed from the dispenser body, is 
brought to the female connection piece. While the  
 
dispensing tube in a whipped cream dispenser cannot contain 
large quantities of food product and can easily be emptied 
before the dispensing tube is removed from the dispenser 
body, in soft-ice distributing devices and the like large 
quantities of food product are present in the conduit 
connected to the male connecting piece. Dropping of the 
food product will dirty the inside of the distributing 
device. This can be partly avoided by holding a container 
under the male connection piece when transporting it from 
the reservoir containing the liquid composition towards the 
female connection piece, but that complicates the cleaning. The invention aims at providing in such a coupling for 
connecting conduits in an automatic device for distributing 
a food product, allowing a simple and efficient way of 
cleaning the automatic device conduit as well as the male 
connection piece. To this end, a recoil valve is mounted

<CLAIMS>
Coupling for removably connecting a conduit (34) for 
cleaning liquid to a conduit in an automatic device for 

distributing a liquid or semi-liquid food product, which 
coupling (1,2) comprises a first male connection piece (1) 

with a body (3) provided with a passage (4) to which the 
conduit connects and a female connection piece (2) formed 

by a recipient which is opened at one end, removably 
connecting with its open end in a leak-proof way to the 

body (3) of the male connection piece (1) but surrounding 
with its closed end, with an interval, an extremity of the 

body (3) of the male connection piece (1) on which the 
passage (4) in this connection piece (1) gives, while the 

recipient (2) is provided in its wall and laterally with 
respect to the passage (4) through the body (3), with an 

opening (33) for connecting the cleaning conduit (34), 
which opening (33) gives on said interval (32), 

characterized in that a recoil valve (23) is mounted in the 
passage (4) of the body (3) of the male connection piece 

(1), which valve (23) when the male connection piece (1) is 
free or connects the automatic device conduit to a 

reservoir, only allows a flow towards the automatic device 
conduit, and in that the recipient (2) forming the female 

connection piece is provided at its bottom and opposite the 
passage (4) with a pen (35) which automatically pushes the 

recoil valve (23) in the passage (4) in open position when 
the recipient (2) is connected to the male connection piece 

(1). 
Coupling according to the preceding claim, 
characterized in that at least one electrode (21) is 

mounted inside the body (3) of the male connection piece 
(1), said electrode being electrically isolated from the  

 
body and having one extremity located in the passage (4) of 

the body (3), the other extremity being provided with a 
connection (20) for an electric conductor (18) for the 

connection to a measuring instrument. 
Coupling according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the male connection piece (1) 

comprises a junction piece (5) for the automatic device 
conduit which is rotatably mounted on the body (3) and the 

inside of which connects in a leak-proof way to the passage 
(4) through this body (3). 
Coupling according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the passage (4) in the body (3) is 

located axially, whereas the body (3) is round. 
Coupling according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises means (36, 37) for 

removably connecting the recipient (2) of the female 
connection piece and the body (3) of the male connection 

piece (1) to each other. 
Coupling according to the preceding claim, 
characterized in that these means (36, 37) are formed by 

two brace parts (36) which are connected hingeably to the 
recipient (2) and clutch around a part (8) of the male 

connection piece (1) when they are rotated towards each 
other.
