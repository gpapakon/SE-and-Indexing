<ABSTRACT>
An electric discharge machining device machines work pieces by virtue of electric discharging while supplying 
machining liquid containing powder into a machining gap formed between a tool electrode and a workpiece to be 

machined. A required member in a work tank is received in a covering member so that it is protected from the powder 
contained in the machining liquid. A liquid supplying device supplies not only the liquid containing the powder 

into the machining gap during an electric discharge machining process but also liquid containing no powder into the 
covering member. Therefore, there is no risk of powder adhering to a sliding portion such as a wire electrode guide 

and a conducting element, or a rotating portion such as a bearing provided in rollers disposed along a carrier such of 
a wire electrode, thereby making it possible to perform precision machining.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric discharge 
machining ("EDM") apparatus. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to an electric discharge machining apparatus 
which uses powder-containing dielectric fluid and powder-free 
dielectric fluid. In general, an EDM apparatus is classified into two 
types, a die-sinking EDM and a wire-cut EDM. A die-sinking EDM 
includes a three-dimensional shaped tool electrode to induce 
electric discharges across a gap formed between the workpiece 
being machined and the tool electrode by applying a voltage 
across the gap while filling the gap with dielectric fluid such 
as, kerosine or solution having a high molecular compound. On the other hand, a wire-cut EDM includes a wire made 
from such material as brass or tungsten having 0.02 to 0.03 
millimeters in diameter as a tool electrode. During electric 
discharge machining, the wire, which travels between a pair of 
wire guides, is positioned opposite to a workpiece to machine the 
workpiece. In general, deionized water or kerosene based fluid 
is used as dielectric fluid which is filled in the gap formed 
between the travelling wire and the workpiece. It is well-known that during finish-machining a sort of 
dielectric fluid, which mixes with fine powder such as 
polycrystalline silicon, is used to improve surface roughness of  
 
the workpiece being machined and increase machining stability. 
British Patent No. 828,336 and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,392,042 and 
4,952,768 disclose the use of this sort of fluid. When this sort of fluid is used in a wire-cut EDM, the 
powder may go into the rotating parts in a work tank, for 
example, into rollers, which are provided along a wire transport 
path, and reach the bearings of the rollers, affecting the 
transportation of wire, which in turn may result in an undesired 
effect on the machining. Further, if the powder enters a wire guide assembly, 
which contains moveable wire guides and moveable current pickups 
for delivering current to a wire, it may impede the movements of 
the wire guides and the current pickups. In addition, it is 
troublesome to remove the powder that is remaining in the wire 
transport mechanism and the wire guide assembly after the 
machining operation is finished. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
electric discharge machining apparatus for preventing 
powder-containing fluid from adhering to the necessary parts in 
the work tank. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
an electric discharge machining
