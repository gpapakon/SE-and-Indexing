<ABSTRACT>
A hot gas cleanup system for removing 
particulates, alkali and sulfur from fuel gas produced by 

the gasification of coal in a gasifier, especially in an 
integrated gas turbine gasification power plant. A calcium 

based sulfur sorbent and an alkali sorbent are injected 
directly into the fuel gas and then recovered, along with 

the used sorbent, in a high efficiency, high temperature 
ceramic barrier filter. The fuel gas is then subjected to 

further de-sulfurization in a polishing de-sulfurizer 
supplied with a copper based sulfur sorbent. The used 

copper based sorbent is regenerated in fluidized bed 
regenerator. The regenerated sorbent is returned to the 

polishing de-sulfurizer and sulfur dioxide produced by the 
regeneration is directed to an oxidizer to which the used 

and unused sulfur sorbent from the filter is supplied so 
that the sulfur dioxide can be captured and so that the 

used sulfur sorbent can be converted to a more stable form 
for disposal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system and
method for cleaning a hot coal-derived fuel gas. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a hot gas
cleanup system and a method for removing particulates,
sulfur and alkali species from high temperature, high
pressure coal-derived fuel gas in an integrated combined
cycle coal gasification power plant or in a direct coal-fired
gas turbine power plant.The high efficiency, low capital cost and short
lead time of gas turbine based power plants make them
particularly attractive to electric utilities as a means of
producing electrical power. Unfortunately, traditionally,
gas turbines have been limited to operation on expensive,
sometimes scarce, fuels -- chiefly, distillate oil and
natural gas. As a result of the ready availability and low
cost of coal, considerable effort has been expended toward
developing a gas turbine system for generating electrical
power that can utilize coal as its primary fuel.Two such approaches have been developed. In one
approach, referred to as an integrated combined cycle coal
gasification power plant, steam and compressed air from the
gas turbine compressor, or compressed oxygen, is used to
partially combust coal in a gasifier to produce a low to
medium heating value fuel gas. In the second approach,
coal is directly gasified in compressed air from the
compressor, producing a low heating value fuel gas. In
either approach, a high temperature, high pressure gas is 
produced that must then be expanded in the turbine section
of the gas turbine. Since the gas contains particulate
matter, as well as sulfur and alkali species, all of which
can be harmful to the turbine components, it is important
that the gas be cleaned prior to expansion in the turbine.
The cleaned gas should also satisfy environmental emission
standards.Traditionally, fuel gas cleanup systems operate at
near ambient temperature and require large heat exchanger
equipment to cool the hot fuel gas prior to cleaning. Such
low temperature gas cleaning is expensive and reduces the
power plant efficiency. While high temperature cleanup
systems have been proposed that utilize ceramic barrier
filter technology to remove particulates and zinc-based
sorbents to remove sulfur, such systems have a high capital
cost and are expensive to operate. The operating temperature
of the zinc-based sorbents is limited so that large
heat exchanger equipment is still required. In addition,
the cost of zinc-based sorbents is high and sorbent losses
due to physical and chemical attrition
