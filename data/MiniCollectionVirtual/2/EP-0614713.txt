<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic braking apparatus for a 
continuous casting mold comprises a casting mold (1) with 

a rectangular cross section including wide side walls (2) 
and narrow end walls (3); electromagnets (10) each of 

which comprises a core (7) disposed along the side wall 
of the casting mold and a coil (8) wound around the core 

for applying a magnetic field in the direction across the 
side walls of the casting mold (1); and a support frame 

(6) for supporting a width changing device (4) for 
changing the width of the casting mold (1) and cooling 

boxes (5) for cooling the casting mold (1), the support 
frame (6) extending to surround the casting mold (1) and 

the electromagnets (10) and connected to the cores (7) of 
the electromagnets (10) to thereby form the magnetic path 

of the electromagnets (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic 
braking apparatus for controlling molten steel 
flowing down in a casting mold by applying a static electromagnetic 
field to the molten steel supplied from a 
submerged nozzle into the casting mold, in the continuous 
casting of the molten steel. A method of controlling molten steel flowing 
down in a casting mold by applying a static electromagnetic 
field to the molten steel supplied into the 
casting mold is effective to gather and catch inclusions 
and prevent the entrapment of powders and bubbles when 
killed steel and in particular low carbon Al killed steel 
is continuously cast at a high speed. Electromagnetic braking apparatuses used to 
this method are disclosed in Japanese Patent Examined 
Publication No. 2-20349 and Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication No. 2-284750 and generally have the 
arrangement shown in Figures 1 and 2. A casting mold 1 
with a rectangular cross section has wide side walls 2 
and narrow end walls 3. An electromagnet 10 is disposed 
along each of the side walls 2 and has a core 7 and coil 
8 wound around the core 7. A magnetic path forming iron 
core 13 is connected to ends of the cores 7 and extends 
to surround the casting mold 1 to thereby constitute an  
 
electromagnet device for applying a static electromagnetic 
field in the direction across the side walls 2 
of the casting mold 1. The electromagnet device is 
mounted on the support frame 6 disposed on a vibration 
table 9. The support frame 6 further supports a cooling 
box 5 for cooling the casting mold 1 and width changing 
device 4 for changing the width of the casting mold by 
moving the end walls 3 of the casting mold. The magnetic 
path forming iron core 13 has a reduced thickness at the 
portion thereof to be interfered with the width changing 
device 4 and support frame 6 to prevent the interference 
with these components. Further, the corner of the 
magnetic path forming iron core 13 is chamfered to 
prevent the interference with water pipes 11 connected to 
the cooling boxes. Further, an opening, through which 
the magnetic path forming iron core 13 passes, is defined 
to the cooling box so that the magnetic path forming iron 
core 13 extends to surround the casting mold and the 
electromagnet. The electromagnet device must reduce the 
magnetic resistance of the magnet path forming iron core 
to effectively produce a static electromagnetic field. 
For this purpose, the magnetic path forming iron core 
preferably has a large cross sectional area.
