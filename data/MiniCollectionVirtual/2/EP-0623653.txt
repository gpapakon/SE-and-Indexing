processability. The hydrophilic treating aqueous solution contains 
as main components a hydrophilic high molecular compound 

having a specific molecular weight and containing a polyoxyalkylene 
chain of 10 wt% or more in terms of solid content, and a 

specific aqueous resin. This enables the formation of film 
conferring a processability and good hydrophilicity and persistency 

of hydrophilicity on the surface of aluminum or aluminum 
alloy for use in aluminum fins of a heat exchanger, as well as 

suppressing the generation of unpleasant odor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrophilic surface
treating aqueous solution, hydrophilic surface treating method
and hydrophilic surface treating film, and more particularly,
to a hydrophilic surface treating aqueous solution, hydrophilic
surface treating method and hydrophilic surface treating film,
capable of forming a film having anticorrosion and
hydrophilicity on aluminum material such as aluminum fins of a
heat exchanger.Aluminum and its alloy are widely utilized for heat
exchangers due to its light-weight and superior processability
and thermal conductivity. With the spread of air conditioning
systems, the number of cooling equipment or dehumidifying/cooling/heating
air-conditioners is increasing. Typically, fins
made of aluminum alloy are provided on the heat exchanging
sections of these air-conditioners.During the cooling mode of the air-conditioners, in
general, the moisture in the air tends to adhere to the surface
of the fins in the form of condensed water. It is therefore
conceivable to confer a water repellency on the fin surface.
The fin surface having the water repellency properties may
allow the adhesion of the condensed water onto the fins in the 
form of hemispheres and the presence of bridge-like water between
the fins. This will disadvantageously prevent the air flow of
the heat exchanger and increase the air conducting resistance.
Thus, the repellent fin surface may contribute to the reduction
in heat exchanging efficiency.Aluminum and its alloy originally has a good
anticorrosion. In the case where the condensed water remains
on the fin surface for a long period of time, hydration
reaction or corrosion reaction are accelerated due to the
formation of the oxygen concentration cell on the fin surface
and to the adhesion and condensation of the contaminated
component in air. Thus, the corrosion products which have been
produced by the above reaction accumulate on the fin surface,
which will impair the heat exchange ability and during the heating
drive in winter cause the exhaust of white minute powder
particles from the air fan together with the warmed air.In order to solve the above problems, it has thus become
desirable in recent years to improve the hydrophilicity and
anticorrosion on the fin surface.For example, U.S. Patent No. 4973359 titled "Surface Treatment
Chemical and Bath for Forming Hydrophilic and Coating and
Method of Surface Treating Aluminum Members" discloses a hydrophilic
surface treating chemical, and so on which contain predetermined
amounts of sodium salt
