<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor line (1) has an associated movable device (5) on 
which members such as ultrasound cutters (12, 13) are 

mounted for acting on products (4) advancing on the 
conveyor line (1). The movable device (5) is moved back 

and forth so that it can follow the movement of the 
conveyor line cyclically whilst the members (12, 13) 

mounted thereon act on the products (4) disposed on the 
line (1). The movable device (5) is moved by means of a 

crank-and-connecting-rod mechanism (7, 9) and the speed of 
rotation of the crank (7) is controlled (11) in a manner 

such that the movement of the movable device (5) for 
following the line (1) takes place at a constant speed 

corresponding to the speed of advance of the line (1). 
The movement of the members (12, 13) disposed on the 

movable device (5) is synchronized with the aforementioned 
following movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a movement-synchronizing 
device according to the preamble to Claim 1, which is known, 
e.g. from US-A- 4 359 918. The invention has been developed with particular attention 
to its possible use in systems for the manufacture and 
packaging of food products such as, for example, 
confectionery products. In this field of application, a need often arises to 
perform various operations (for example, the withdrawal of 
products, the loading of products, decoration, packaging, 
etc.) on products which are moving along a conveyor line, 
without stopping, or at least without substantially 
stopping, the advance of the products. In this situation of use, it is known to dispose the 
members for operating on the products on devices (slides). 
For instance EP-A-0 071 653 discloses an arrangement where a horizontally reciprocating 
table supports a number of operating stations (i.e. without movement proper with respect to a 
conveyor line). The reciprocating table has associated therewith operating means enabling the 
two strokes of the back-and-forth movement to be performed at different speeds. Arrangements 
are also generally known in the art which employ slides  
 
which are movable back and forth along a conveyor line. 
This enables the members which operate on the products to 
follow the products along the line, so to speak, during 
their operating phase. During their following travel, the 
members thus remain substantially stationary relative to 
the products on which they are operating even though the 
products continue to move along the conveyor line. In particular, it is known to cause the slide on which the 
members operating on the products are mounted to move back 
and forth by means of a follower device which has a cam and 
is subservient to the drive system of the line on which the 
products are advancing. This takes place with the use of 
a wholly mechanical control solution.  
 Other solutions are also known, however, in which the 
slide is moved back and forth by an electric motor (for 
example, by means of a screw which engages a female thread 
mounted on the slide). In this case, the electric motor 
which drives the slide is made electronically subservient 
to the drive system which advances the product along the 
line. Although the solutions described above are wholly 
satisfactory conceptually, various problems are encountered 
in implementing them, particularly in connection with the 
inertia of the parts concerned. This occurs not only with 
purely mechanical
