<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a treating
method and a treating apparatus of a used cell or
battery, and to a method and an apparatus for treating a
lithium cell.Demands of cells or batteries are increasing
year by year. Effective utilization of chemical
substances employed in cells or batteries, and also
problems of environmental pollution caused by cells or
batteries must be considered. For example, lithium and
transition metal element and the like employed in a
lithium cell are variable substances to be reused.
Rechargeable lithium secondary cells are extensively used
year after year as backup power sources for computers and
power sources for compact home appliances. Other demands
as power storage power sources, or power sources for
automobiles may have a bright future.High energy type cells typically known as
lithium cells employ electrolytic solution containing
negative-electrode activated substances such as
reaction-activated alkali metals, and also substances
reactive to water. And most of positive electrodes
include great deal of reusable metal component. As a
consequence, when used cells are dismantled, it is
desired to propose such a treatment method that cell-activated 
substances, or activated substances such as
electrolytic solution are brought into inert substances
under safety states, and reusable valuable chemical
substances are collected. However, no confirmation could
be made about any method for treating a large number of
cells such as used lithium cells in an industrial scale,
or any invention related to a cell treating apparatus.To suppress environmental pollution caused by
chemical substances contained in used cells, or used
batteries, and to improve utilization of resources
employed in these cells, cell treating methods as well as
methods for reusing cell materials have been required for
long time.Generally speaking, a specific care should be
taken to handle such high-energy density type cells as
lithium cells, because these cells contain cell activated
substances or electrolyte with extremely high chemical
reactive characteristics. For instance, carbon compounds
into which a lithium metal, a lithium alloy, and lithium
have been inserted by electrical and chemical methods,
are utilized in a negative electrode of a lithium cell,
and therefore any of these compounds extremely reacts to
water, thereby producing hydrogen gas. Also in the
above-described cells, there are employed other than the
above-mentioned alkali metal, either valuable substances
such as reusable transition
