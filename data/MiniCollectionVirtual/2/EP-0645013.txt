<DESCRIPTION>
 TEST FOR PERIOD0NTITIS AND SUSCEPTIBILITY THERETO Background of the invention 1. Field of the invention This invention relates to diagnosis of periodontal disease (periodontitls), a serious gum disease estimated to affect 10% of the population. The Invention aims to diagnose susceptibility to the disease, thereby giving an early warning to patients most at risk.. . Description of the related artSo far as 1s known, there 1s no known way of predicting susceptibility to periodontal disease. Prior art, the relevance of which becomes apparent only with knowledge of the invention, Is referred to below. Summary of the inventionIt 1s known that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) change shape (become non-polarised) when these cells are exposed to products from virulent strains of Porphyromonas ginoivalis. a bacterium implicated in destructive periodontitls. This morphological change is manifested by an Increase in large non-polar cells of diameter at least 18 micrometres and a decrease in polarised and of small non-polar cells less than 18 micrometres in diameter. In simple terms, the cells become large and flattened. See M. A. Scragg, L. R. Turton and D. M. Williams, Archives of Oral Biology __W, 167-173 (1990). The effect 1s less pronounced when the strain of P. qinqivalls 1s a variant of reduced pathogenlcity : M. A. Scragg, L. R. Turton and D. M. Williams, Archives of Oral Biology 3_£, 709-714 (1991).The change of shape has been correlated with alterations in the polymerisation of globular actin present in the PMNs to filamentous actin (F-actin). See e.g. T. D. Coates ei J L, J.Cell Biology ill (4), 765-774 (May 1992). 

 It has now surprisingly been found that the interaction between PMNs and virulent strains of P. αinαivalls can be used to test for the susceptibility of dental patients to periodontal disease. The PMNs of patients suffering from periodontal disease exhibit a much more marked shape change than those from non-sufferers and since this phenomenon is detectable, especially by a known binding reaction of phalloidin to F-actin, it forms the basis of an assay. In view of the involvement of a non-localised cell, the test is presumed to reflect host response to the disease, i.e. to be a measure of the capability of the individual's immune and Inflammatory systems to resist the disease, and therefore to be a test for susceptibility. As the change in shape of the PMNs to large non-polarised forms is correlatable with loss of F-actin and therefore a reduction in the observed binding of phalloidin to

CLAIMS
1. A method of testing for periodontltis or a susceptibility thereto, the method comprising measuring the change 1n morphology of polymorphonuclear leukocytes of a sample taken from a dental patient, after they have been caused to Interact with supernatant from a culture of a periodontltis-associated strain of Porphyromonas gingivalis or of a periodontltis- associated component of said culture, for a time period sufficient to reveal a difference in morphological change of polymorphonuclear leukocytes between patients suffering from or susceptible to periodontltis and patients free from periodontitis.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the morphological change is measured as reduction of F-actin content in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein the reduction of F-actin content is measured by the binding of F-act1n to phalloidin.
4. A method according to claim 3 wherein the actin-phalloidin binding Is measured by labelling the phalloidin and determining the amount of bound label.
5. A method according to claim 4 wherein the phalloidin is conjugated to the residue of a molecule which fluoresces when bound to phalloidin. 6. A method according to claim 5 wherein the molecule is fluorescein isothiocyanate.
7. A method according to claim 4 wherein the phalloidin 1s labelled by conjugation to biotin which 1s bound to enzyme- labelled avidln or streptavidin. 8. A method according to claim 7 wherein the determination of label 1s by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 9. A kit for testing for periodontltis or susceptibility thereto, comprising: 


 (1) a strain of £. gingivalis as defined in claim 1, and
(2) labelled phalloidin or components which when Interacted will give rise to labelled phalloidin.
10. A kit according to claim 9 wherein component (2) consists of (a) phalloidin conjugated to the residue of a molecule which fluoresces when bound thereto or (b) phalloidin conjugated to biotin and, separately therefrom, enzyme-labelled avidin or streptavldln.
