<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, the discharge 
quantity of the powder paint from the frictional 

electrification gun (1) does not vary with the air pressure. 
The charge quantity of the powder paint can be increased by 

adjusting the air pressure. The feeder (5,9) of the powder paint 
to the frictional electrification gun (1) is provided 

independently of the injector (3), and the discharge quantity 
is determined by the feeder (5,9) provided separately from the 

injector (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frictional 
electrification type electrostatic painting device which 
electrically charges a powder paint by friction with a 
nonconductive resin tube by causing the powder paint to 
pass through the nonconductive resin tube. In the conventional frictional electrification type 
electrostatic painting device, a powder paint is sucked 
from a paint tank by an injector, fed by the carrier air of 
the injector, and let pass through a gun having a 
nonconductive resin tube. The powder paint is charged with 
static electricity by friction with the inner wall of the 
nonconductive resin tube. The charged powder paint is 
discharged from the tip of the gun and applied onto the 
object to be painted. In such a frictional electrification type 
electrostatic painting device, if the velocity of the 
carrier air is increased, the friction between the powder 
paint and the inner wall of the nonconductive resin tube is 
increased, thereby increasing the charge quantity. Accordingly, in order to increase the charge quantity 
of the powder paint, it was necessary to increase the air 
pressure of the carrier air of the injector, or to let the  
 
acceleration air flow into the inlet of the gun. In the conventional frictional electrification type 
electrostatic painting device, however, since the suction 
of the powder paint from the paint tank is carried out by 
the injector, if the air pressure of the injector is 
increased or the acceleration air is introduced into the 
gun, the suction volume of the powder paint changes. Thus, 
the powder discharge quantity is not stable. Particularly, if the acceleration air is supplied, a 
resistance acts on the injector through the powder hose. 
As a result, the discharge quantity decreases and it 
becomes difficult to obtain a predetermined discharge 
quantity of the powder paint. An object of the present invention is to increase the 
charge quantity of the powder paint by increasing the 
velocity of the powder paint passing through the 
nonconductive resin tube without affecting the discharge 
quantity of the powder paint. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, 
according to the present invention, a feeder for feeding 
the powder paint to the gun having a nonconductive resin 
tube is provided independently of the injector. Since a feeder for feeding the powder paint is 
provided independently of the injector, the discharge 
quantity of the powder paint is determined not by the air  
 
pressure of the carrier air of the injector, but by
