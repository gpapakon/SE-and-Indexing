<ABSTRACT>
The sealing device (8) for the passage of a fluid between a rotating race and a non-rotating race of a rolling-contact bearing, each race having channels (6, 7) for the passage of the fluid passing through them, comprises an annular central body (9) of a single piece made of an elastic substance exhibiting a circular rim (10) for fixing it to one of the races (1), and two main sealing lips (12) which between them form an annular intermediate chamber (13) and which are in rubbing contact with the other race (2). The central body (9) has at least one channel (15) passing through it and communicating on the one hand with the channels (6) of the race associated with the circular fixing rim and, on the other hand, with the intermediate chamber, which communicates with the channels (7) of the other race so that the fluid introduced into the channels of one of the races of the rolling-contact bearing passes through the central body in a sealed fashion and emerges via the channels in the other race.

A sealing device (8) for the passage of the fluid
between a rotating race and a non-rotating race of a

bearing, each penetrated by channels (6,7) for the
passage of the fluid, comprising an annular central body

(9) havinga circular shoulder (10) for fixing to one of
the rotating or non-rotating races (1), and two main

sealing lips (12) which mutually form an annular
intermediate chamber (13), and which are in friction

contact with the other race (2), the central body (9)
being penetrated by at least one channel (15) which

communicates with the channels (6) of the race 1
associated with the circular fixing shoulder , and also

with the intermediate chamber , which communicates with
the channels (7) of the other race, so that the fluid

introduced into the channels of one of the races of the
bearing passes through the central body and the annular

intermediate chamber in a leaktight manner and exits
through the channels of the other race, characterized in

that the annular central body (9) is made in one-piece of
elastic material and includes the two main sealing lips

(12)
The device of claim 1 , characterized in that the
main sealing lips (12) comprise in their friction zone

(14) a coating which has better friction , tightness and
friction coefficient features than the rest of the main

lips (12).
The device of claim 1 or 2 , characterized in that
the central body (9) comprises two secondary sealing lips

(16) in friction contact with the race (2) associated
with the main sealing lips to prevent the lubricant

contained in the bearing from entering into contact with
the friction zones (14) of the main sealing lips (12).
The device of any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the annular central body (9) is

symmetrical about a radial plane, the channels (6,7 and
15) of the races of the bearing and of the central body 

lying in the plane of symmetry.
The device of claim 4, characterized in that a U-section
annular metallic reinforcement (17) allowing the

axial force fit on the central body (9) on a cylindrical
surface of the race (1) receiving the circular shoulder

(10) for fixing on the central body, and the
rigidification of the central body.
The device of claim 4, characteried in that it
comprises a tubular metallic insert (18) on which the

central body (9) is duplicate molded, the metallic insert
allowing the axial fit of the central body on a

cylindrical surface of the race (1) associated with the
circular shoulder (10) for fixing the central body.
The device of any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the main lips (12) are curved as

they come together, so that the internal portion of said
main lips is pressurized on their friction surface partly

by the action of the pressure.
A bearing comprising an outer race (1), an inner
race (2) both penetrated by channels (6,7) for the

passage of a fluid, characterized in that it is equipped
with a sealing device (8) according to one of the

preceding claims, to allow the passage of the fluid
between the channels arranged in the races.
The bearing of claim 7,characterized in that, in
the race (1) associated with the assembly of the sealing

device (8), an annular groove (19) is arranged, into
which the channels (6)of said race and at least one

channel (15) of the central body (9) of the device
terminate.
The bearing of claims 7 or 8, characterized in
that the outer race (1) has an annular slot (11) for the

assembly of the fixing shoulder (10) of the central body
(9) of the device.
