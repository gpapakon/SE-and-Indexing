<ABSTRACT>
A scan control for use with an ion implantation system 10. A servo motor 106 
having an output shaft scans a wafer support 42 through an ion beam 44 to controllably 

treat the wafer. A digital signal processor 105 monitors an encoder output corresponding 
to motor shaft orientation and compares this position with a desired position of the wafer 

support 42. An error signal modifies a motor energization signal based on this comparison. 
Velocity damping based upon sensed motor speed and wafer support speed 

smooths the scan motion via a second motor energization correction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ion beam implantation system and more 
particularly relates to method and apparatus to scan a circular wafer through an 
ion beam to treat the wafer. In a most typical application of the invention, the 
wafer is made of silicon and the result of the ion beam scanning of the wafer 
provides a semiconductor wafer that can be further processed to form an integrated 
circuit. One technique for doping semi-conductor wafers is to direct a beam of ions 
to impinge upon such a wafer to produce controlled concentrations of doping 
impurities within the wafer. An important parameter of a semi-conductor wafer 
ion implant process is the spatial uniformity of the implanted dose across the 
wafer. Another important parameter is the angle of incidence of the ion beam 
with respect to the wafer and internal lattice structure of the silicon crystal (or 
GaAs lattice or other crystalline substrate). The angle of incidence is important 
because of the role it plays in the phenomenon of channeling. Dopant depth profiles 
vary as a function of position on the wafer surface if the incident angle of the 
beam varies across the surface. In medium and low current ion implanters, the ion beam is commonly 
directed across the wafer surface by deflection scanning of the beam in a controlled 
pattern. This has commonly been done using two orthogonal pairs of 
electrostatic deflection plates or electrodes to produce the beam defections. 
Application of a triangular waveform voltage to the plates can produce rectangular 
raster scan patterns on the wafer. U.S. Patent No. 4,514,637 to Dykstra et al. 
discloses one such medium to low current ion implanter.  
 Electrostatic ion beam deflection scanning results in different angles of 
beam incidence at different locations on the wafer surface. This is the source of a 
major depth nonuniformity (from the resulting channeling variations) which occurs 
in this type of implanter. High current implanters move the wafer through a stationary beam by 
mechanical means such as attaching the wafers to a spinning disk passing through 
the beam or other well-known mechanical scanning techniques. These mechanical 
scanners have tended to be designed so that as the wafer moves through the ion 
beam, the angle of beam incidence remains constant or nearly so. For this reason, 
mechanical scanning of wafers through a stationary beam has come to be considered 
as a superior method to x-y deflection of the beam for producing depth 
uniformity and minimum mask shadows

A method of operating an ion implanter (10) that includes an ion source (12) 
for generating an ion beam (44), a movable wafer support (42) for positioning wafers within 

the ion beam, a motor (106) coupled to the wafer support by a transmission (107) that 
converts rotary movement of a motor output shaft to translational movement of the 

wafer support (42) through the ion beam, and a controller (102) for activating the motor to 
provide a scan of the wafer through an ion beam impinging onto the wafers, comprising 

the steps of: 

a) monitoring a position of the motor shaft to provide a first position 
signal and monitoring a position of the wafer support (42) to provide a second position 

signal; 
b) comparing the first position signal with a target position signal to 
produce a position error signal for energizing the motor; 
c) determining instantaneous motor shaft velocity and wafer velocity 
based upon the first and second position signals as the motor (106) scans the wafer 

through the ion beam (44); and 
d) modifying the position error signal with a damping correction factor
