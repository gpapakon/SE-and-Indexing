<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for regenerating reducing agents used in ancillary chemical or 
electrochemical processes such as restoring solderability of electronic components. The system 

includes a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte system that is separated by a semipermeable 
ionic barrier into a catholyte and an anolyte. The catholyte includes the reduced member of a 

redox couple, which can be regenerated electrochemically. The redox couple of the electrolyte 

system is charged like a battery and discharged during the ancillary process. Regeneration of 
the reduced member of the redox couple is accomplished at the cathode. The cathode comprises 

an electrode having a high hydrogen overvoltage so that sufficiently negative potentials can be 
attained while minimizing hydrogen evolution. Chemical balance is maintained by the 

semipermeable ionic barrier, which permits proton migration from the anolyte to the catholyte 
but acts as a barrier against diffusion and migration of cations from the catholyte to the anolyte. 

Ideally, the anodic reaction is breakdown of water to form oxygen, which is vented, and 
protons that migrate across the ionic barrier to the catholyte replacing protons consumed in the 

ancillary process. The overall reaction in a system for restoring solderability of electronic 
components is reduction of metallic oxide to metal and release of oxygen, with no net chemical 

change in the composition of the regeneration system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrochemistry and, in particular, to an electrochemical 
system for regenerating reducing agents that become oxidized in the course of a 
chemical or electrochemical process. Electrochemical regeneration of reducing agents is useful in on-going chemical or 
electrochemical processes such as synthesizing organic compounds or restoring solderability of 
electronic components, for example. A method of restoring solderability of electronic 
components, to which the present invention is applicable, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 
5,104,494 issued April 14, 1992, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
Metallic oxides, when present on solderable portions of electronic components, are detrimental 
to solderability of the components. In the patented process, a reducing agent is used to reduce 
the detrimental oxides to their metallic state, thereby restoring solderability of the electronic 
components. During this process, however, the reducing agent becomes depleted and must be 
replenished. Thus, in any large-scale electronic component soldering system using the patented 
method for restoring and/or ensuring solderability of electronic components, there is a need for 
a further process for regenerating the reducing agent so that the overall soldering system can be 
run efficiently, without interruption, and without generation of environmentally objectionable 
by-products. In the prior art, European Patent Publication EP 0 052 509 A3 (Hitachi, Ltd.) 
describes a method of removing oxide from a metal surface using an apparatus (described on 
page 40 and illustrated in Figure 14) including "an electrolysis tank 36 which has an anode 
chamber 37 and a cathode chamber 38 separated by a cation exchange film 39, a reduction 
electrode (platinum electrode) 40 which is immersed in the wash liquid 21 in the cathode 
chamber 38, a counter electrode (platinum electrode) 41 which is immersed in a liquid 42 in the 
anode chamber 37, and a potentiostat 30." US. Pat. No. 5,078,842 (Wood et al.) 
describes an electrochemical system for removing 
radioactive burden from spent decontamination solutions, in particular from solutions containing vanadous ions. The present invention comprises a process of regenerating reducing agents such as 
those used in restoring solderability of electronic components. In the process of restoring  
 
solderability, which is described herein as an example (but not a limitation) of a system to 
which the present invention is applicable,
