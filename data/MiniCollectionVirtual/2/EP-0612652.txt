<ABSTRACT>
The hydraulic control valve (30) of a hydraulic actuator 
(20) for generating steering assist force comprises a first 

valve member (31) and a second valve member (32) both of which 
are rotatable to each other in response to steering 

resistance. Throttling portions are formed of spaces between 
axially extending edges defined by slots of the first valve 

member and axially extending edges defined by slots of the 
second valve member. The first hydraulic oil outlet slot (51b) 

is located between a right turn slot (50a) and a left turn slot 
(50b), the second hydraulic oil outlet slot (51c) is located 

between communication slots (50c), hydraulic oil feed slots (51a) 
is located between a right turn slot (50a) and a communication 

slot (50c) and between a left turn slot (50b) and a communication 
slot (50c). Closing angle of at least one type of the 

throttling portions (A', B', C', D'), which belong to a second 
group divided into two types of throttling portions, is set 

larger than closing angle of each of the first group 
throttling portions (A, B, C, D). A variable throttle valve (60), 

capable of varying the flow area of its own throttling 
portion in response to driving conditions, is disposed 

between the second group throttling portions (A', B', C', D') 
and the tank (71).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic power 
steering device which provides steering assist force in 
response to steering resistance and driving conditions such 
as vehicle speed, angle of steer, and so on. A hydraulic power steering device, which has been 
conventionally used, comprises a hydraulic actuator and a 
control valve which controls hydraulic pressure acting on the 
hydraulic actuator in response to steering resistance, 
whereby the hydraulic power steering device generates greater 
steering assist force by increasing hydraulic pressure acting 
on the hydraulic actuator as steering resistance increases. A rotary valve, which comprises a cylindrical first 
valve member and a second valve member which is inserted in 
the first valve member so as to be rotatable relative to the 
first valve member in accordance with steering resistance, is 
employed as such a control valve wherein a plurality of 
throttling portions are formed between the inner 
circumference of the first valve member and the outer 
circumference of the second valve member. The flow area of 
each of the throttling portions varies in response to the  
 
angle of relative rotation between the both valve members. 
Each throttling portion is disposed in an oil flow path which 
connects a pump, a tank and the hydraulic actuator to each 
other in order to generate steering assist force according to 
a direction of steer and steering resistance. In the above described hydraulic power steering device 
equipped with the control valve, Unexamined Japanese Patent 
Publication Sho No.61-139563, U.S. Patent No.4561521, 
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication sho No.61-163062, U.S. 
Patent No.4570735 and U.S. Patent No.4570736 disclose 
arrangements in order to achieve fast response characteristic 
in steering operation at low driving speeds and stable 
response characteristic in steering operation at high driving 
speeds. In the disclosed arrangements, the throttling portions 
disposed between both valve members are grouped into a first 
group and a second group, and a variable throttle valve, 
which can vary the flow area of its own throttling portion, 
is disposed in an oil flow path between the second group 
throttle portions and the pump. Also, a plurality of slots 
circumferentially spaced to each other are formed on the 
inner circumference of the first valve member and on the 
outer circumference of the second valve member, and spaces 
between the axially extending edges defined by the slots of 
the first valve member and the
