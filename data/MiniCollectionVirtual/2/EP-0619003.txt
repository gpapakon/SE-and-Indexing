<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge which uses as control members hard material plates (19, 23), and intended for a single-control faucet of the type where both the water inlets and outlets are positioned at the bottom (6) of the cartridge. This cartridge comprises a water-tight shell (1-2) and sealing means (26, 28) interposed between the internal space (0) of the cartridge and the operating members (30, 32) of the cartridge, which are intended to project outside the faucet; and includes communication means (33, 33') that link the internal space (0) of the cartridge with a passage (12) constituting the outlet for mixed water or the intake for the eater to be mixed. In this cartridge, the internal space (0) always receives a pressure equal to the counter-pressure at delivery or, respectively, to the intake pressure, and this pressure is applied in all directions to the movable plate (23) of the cartridge, thus avoiding the disadvantages usually deriving from the modification, due to the counter-pressure at delivery or the intake pressure, of the pressure present between the fixed plate (19) and the movable plate (23) of the cartridge, modification that gives rise to the possible separation of these two plates.

A cartridge intended for a single-control faucet (35) of a type 
having both the water inlet or inlets and the water outlet or outlets positioned 

at the bottom (6) of the cartridge, this cartridge using, as control 
members, two valve plates (19,23) made of hard material, one of which 

(19) is operatively fixed whereas the other (23) is movable with respect 
to the fixed plate (19) under action of operating members (30-32) intended 

to project outside the faucet (35), said movable plate (23) being 
intended to remain in operating contact with said fixed plate (19); the 

cartridge having a water-tight shell (1-2) and sealing means (26,26) interposed 
between the inner space (0) of the cartridge and the operating 

means (30-32) of the cartridge; characterized in that the cartridge comprises 
communication means (33,33') that link the inner space (0) of the 

cartridge with a passage (12) constituting the outlet for mixed water or, 
respectively, the intake for the water to be mixed, whereby the pressure 

that, in the inner space (0) of the cartridge, acts against the exposed 
surface of the movable plate (23) always remains equal to the pressure 

existing in an outlet or inlet passage, this avoiding any action tending to 
take the movable plate (23) out of the fixed plate. 
A cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized in that said 
water-tight sheii (1-2) of the cartridge is formed by a casing substantially 

comprised of a cylindrical portion (1) of greater diameter, adapted 
to be introduced into a chamber (36) of a faucet body (35), and a cylindrical 

portion (2) of smaller diameter, adapted to be surrounded by a lid 
(40) of said faucet body (35), said shell being open at the end of the 

portion (2) of smaller diameter for the passage of the faucet operating 
means (30-32), and at the end of the portion (1) of greater diameter, 

which is tightly closed, after assembly of the inside parts, by a bottom 
member (6) attached to the shell (1-2); and having no other openings.  

 
A cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized in that said 
sealing means (26-28) are arranged the one (26) between a slide (25) 

linked to the movable plate (24) of the cartridge and a rotatable member 
(27) that supports and guides for diametrical displacement said slide 

(25), and the other between said rotatable member (27) and the portion 
(2) of smaller diameter of the cartridge's shell, in which said rotatable 

member (27) is rotatably mounted. 
A cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized in that said 
means of communication (33,33') between the inner space (0) of the 

cartridge and a passage (12) constituting the outlet for mixed water or 
the intake for water to be mixed are defined, at least in part, by the 

space (33) existing between the operatively fixed plate (19) and the 
bottom member (6) of the cartridge. 
A cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized in that at 
least one recess (33') is formed in the bottom member (6) of the cartridge 

to increase the cross section of said means of communication 
(33,33'). 
A cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized in that at 
least one peripheral opening (22') is formed in the fixed plate (19) of the 

cartridge in order to increase the cross section of said means of communication 
(33,33'). 
A cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
movable plate (23) of the cartridge is linked to a slide (25) having a peripheral 

part (34) that is open toward the inner space (0) of the cartridge 
and communicates with the passage opening (24) of the movable plate 

(23).
