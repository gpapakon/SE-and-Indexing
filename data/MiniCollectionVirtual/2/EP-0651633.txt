<DESCRIPTION>
 PHOSPHOPEPTIDES FOR THE TREATBEWT OF DENTAL CA CIITJTSField of the InventionThe invention relates to a method of controlling and preventing dental calculus by contacting the teeth with an oral composition containing specific casein phosphopeptides. Bac roun and Related ArtDental calculus is a mineralised deposit that forms on the surface of teeth. The mineralised deposit is largely crystals of calcium phosphate in various forms, in particular hydroxyapatite. It is desirable to prevent the formation of dental calculus by inhibition or retardation of hydroxyapatite crystal growth and also by inhibition of the transformation of more acidic forms of calcium phosphate (eg. brushite) or amorphous calcium phosphate into hydroxyapatite. Parran Jr. et al have specified the use of soluble inorganic alkalimetal pyrophosphates as anti-calculus agents in oral compositions [US -_.515.772; US 4,590,077 and US 4,68*-,518].In the US Patent 4,534,881 Sikes et al disclose synthetically derived amino acid polymers for the inhibition or retardation of inorganic scaling where the synthetic polymers may contain phosphorylated amino acids. Further, Sikes et al [US 4,866,161 and4,868,287] have disclosed the use of synthetic polyamino acids for the control of dental calculus where the anionic amino acids are clustered at one end of the polypeptide with non-polar residues clustered at the other. The anionic amino acids are independently selected from phosphoserine, phosphohomoserine, phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, glutamate and aspartate. In a further specification [European Patent Application 0,391,629] Sikes has disclosed synthetic polypeptides having a formula poly(X)„(Y)n where X is independently aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, asparagine or phosphoserine each Y independently is a phosphorylated amino acid such as phosphoserine, phosphohomoserine, phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine; m is 2 to 150, n is 1 to 3 and n + m is greater than or equal to 5* Summary of InventionThe polypeptides taught in all of Sikes et al specifications must be synthesized and are composed of a small number of different amino acids in a specific sequence. In the present invention specific casein phosphopeptides, which differ in amino acidSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 composition and sequence to the synthetic polypeptides of Sikes, are shown to have anti-calculus potential. These phosphopeptides have been described as anti-caries and anti-gingivitis agents in United States Patent 563.78 and are referred to for convenience in the present specification as
