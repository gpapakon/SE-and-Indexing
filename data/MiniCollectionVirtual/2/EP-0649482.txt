<ABSTRACT>
A road-surfacing vehicle (1) includes an articulated distribution head (2) in which road-surfacing material is conveyed by way of material transfer means (3) to a laying box (6) for distribution onto a road surface. Control over the degree of articulation of the material transfer means (3) and, if desired, lateral displacement of the laying box (6), facilitates surfacing in confined, curved and irregular areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle adapted to apply 
road-surfacing materials. Road-surfacing vehicles are known which comprise a chamber for 
the material, an outlet and means for mixing the material as it 
passes to a surface distributor, in the form of a laying box, all 
of which are an integral part of the vehicle. The laying box will 
usually be provided at the rear of the vehicle. The road surfacing 
materials pass out from the laying box onto -the road being 
surfaced. These vehicles can be used very satisfactorily to surface open 
areas. However, in view of the limited manoeuvrability of the 
vehicles, the application of microasphalt or other road-surfacing 
materials to curved and confined areas such as lay-bys, bellmouths, 
hammer heads and road islands, has traditionally been carried out 
by hand. By contrast, US-A-4,215,949 and US-A-4,676,689 disclose two 
types of apparatus which are not adapted for surfacing open areas, 
but which are specifically constructed for patching pavements, i.e. 
for filling potholes in the surface of an asphalt pavement or 
roadway. Thus, for example, US-A-4,215,949 shows a vehicle having 
a supply hopper mounted along one side which serves to hold a 
quantity of asphalt. The supply hopper can be lowered to ground 
level to allow a truck to empty asphalt or other patching material 
into it through its open top and then raised for transport and use. 
The vehicle also has a distribution hopper mounted at the end of a 
remotely controlled arm extending from the front of the vehicle. 
The arm has a pair of articulated joints which allow the hopper to 
be positioned over a range of positions by the vehicle operator. 
The distribution hopper, which has an open top, is filled by 
placing it under the forward end of the supply hopper. The supply  
 
hopper has an auger in it which drives the asphalt 
forward to be discharged through a downwardly facing 
opening and into the underlying distribution hopper. 
The asphalt in the supply hopper is kept warm by the 
use of a flame inside the auger tube. Once filled, the 
operator of the vehicle moves the distribution hopper 
over an area to be repaired and remotely operates a 
door at the bottom of the distribution hopper, allowing 
a desired amount of asphalt to be deposited on the 
roadway. A remotely controlled tamper, mounted on the 
distribution hopper, then tamps the asphalt in place. It can readily be appreciated that although the 
vehicle described in US-A-4,215,949 would be suited to 
operating in curved and confined

<CLAIMS>
A road-surfacing vehicle having an articulated 
distribution head (2) which comprises material transfer 

means (3) having first and second ends (4, 5), and a 
laying box (6) connected to the second end (5) of said 

material transfer means (3),
 
   characterized in that the first end (4) of the 

material transfer means (3) is laterally pivotally mounted on the 
vehicle and in that the vehicle further comprises means 

(11, 16) for controlling the degree of articulation of 
the material transfer means (3) relative to the 

vehicle, the material transfer means (3) being 
connected to the laying box (6), such that the laying 

box (6) is laterally movable relative to the material 
transfer means (3).  

 
A vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the material transfer 
means incorporates means for mixing the material. 
A vehicle according to claim 2, wherein the material transfer 
means is a mixer box. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the distribution head is at the rear of the vehicle.
