<ABSTRACT>
A dual sensitivity stud sensor senses studs through both thick and thin surfaces. Studs are sensed by detecting a change in the capacitive loading of plates (24, 32) as they are moved along a surface and in proximity with a stud. The sensor informs the operator, via output (14, 18, 26), when the sensor has been incorrectly calibrated over a stud. The sensor also informs the operator if the sensor is placed against a surface either too thick or too thin for stud detection. Through use of a digital register (38), the sensor remains calibrated indefinitely while the sensor is powered on.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic sensor, and,
in particular, to a sensor suitable for detecting the
location of studs behind a variety of surfaces, including
walls, floors and similar type structures. More
specifically, the invention relates to an electronic stud
sensor with two sensitivity modes for determining the
location of studs behind either thick or thin surfaces,
and with the ability to inform the user when the sensor
has been calibrated over a stud.U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,622 issued Aug. 7, 1984,
discloses an electronic
wall stud sensor particularly suitable for locating a wall
stud positioned behind a wall surface. The sensor detects
the stud by measuring a change in the capacitance of the
wall due to the presence of a stud while the sensor is
moved along the wall surface. The sensor includes a
plurality of capacitor plates mounted in the sensor close
to the wall surface, a circuit for detecting any changes
in the capacitance of the capacitor plates due to a change
in the dielectric constant of the wall caused by the
location of a stud positioned behind the wall surface and
immediately adjacent to the capacitor, and an indicator
for indicating the change in capacitance of the capacitor
plate, thereby indicating the wall stud position. The
sensor also alerts the operator when calibration is
occurring.While the above described electronic wall stud sensor
operates as described to locate studs in walls, experience
has shown that its performance could be improved in 
several respects. The stud sensor is unable to reliably
sense studs through surfaces significantly thicker than the
typical 5/8 inch (1.5875 cm) sheetrock wall. For instance,
the sensor can not sense floor joists (another type of stud)
under a combination of 3/4 inch (1.155 cm) subfloor and 1/4
inch (0.385 cm) oak flooring.US 4041382 discloses a measurement system with a first
calibration signal for calibrating the system at one end of
a range of parameters being measured by controlling an
output function; second calibration circuitry connected to
the bridge circuit to provide a second calibration signal
for calibrating the system at the other end of the range by
controlling the effective value of the reference voltage
supplied to the bridge circuit; sequencing circuitry for
automatically causing the first calibration circuitry to
calibrate the system at one end of the range, and then
automatically causing the second calibration circuitry to
calibrate the system at the other end of the range; and a
control for activating said

<CLAIMS>
A dual sensitivity capacitive stud sensor for determining
the location of a stud positioned behind a surface, comprising:


a sensor comprising capacitive loading sensor plates (24, 32) movable along the surface to sense the stud;
a sensitivity selector (30) operatively connected to the
sensor for operating the sensor in a user selected one of only

two sensitivity modes, the modes being a high sensitivity mode
and a normal sensitivity mode; said sensitivity selector being

controlled by a control signal (31); an averager for receiving data signals from the sensor plates (24, 32) averaging them and
an indicator (14, 26) operatively connected to the sensor
for indicating when a stud has been sensed in either

sensitivity mode.
A dual sensitivity method for determining a location of
a stud positioned behind a surface, comprising:


providing only a high sensitivity mode and a normal
sensitivity mode, the modes corresponding to the thickness of

the surface behind which the stud is positioned;
entering the high or normal sensitivity mode under user
control;
sensing the stud
in either the first or

second sensitivity mode; averaging stud sensing data signals and
indicating when the stud has been sensed.
A dual sensitivity method as claimed in claim 2, using
sensor plates (24, 32) that sense a change in capacitive loading caused by the stud

positioned behind the surface, the method comprising:

moving the sensor (24, 32) along the surface;
sending said data signals when said change in
capacitive loading caused by the stud is sensed; 
averaging said data signals over a predetermined time to provide an
averaged digital data signal;
inputting the averaged digital data signal
to an adder (34) and using as another

input to the adder (34) a data signal
dependent on the sensitivity mode

selected by the user;
converting the added signal to an analog signal; and
sending the analog signal to one of the sensor plates (32).
