<ABSTRACT>
A combination splash/trickle pack for an evaporative 
cooler, which comprises packing elements 10,12 made from 

expanded metal or plastics sheets. The packing elements 
10,12 are arranged such that in use they form a stack of 

packing elements within the cooler with the width and 
length of the packing elements determining the width and 

depth of the pack. Each of a plurality of the elements 
10,12 has an inclined surface with an angle of inclination 

which varies so that in use a first region of the surface 
is sufficiently inclined to the horizontal to serve as a 

trickle surface and a second region of the surface is 
sufficiently close to the horizontal to serve as a splash 

surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
pack and a method for constructing a pack.
Evaporative coolers may be used for cooling a gas such
as air using a liquid such as water as a coolant, or
for cooling a liquid using gas as a coolant, and/or
for humidifying the gas.Induced and natural draft wet cooling towers, in
both cross and counter-flow configurations, are
examples of an evaporative cooler to which this
invention relates, for cooling water using air as the
coolant. The present invention relates particularly
to packings therefor. However, it should be
understood that whenever the invention is described
with respect to cooling towers only, it is not the
Applicant's intention that the invention, insofar as
it relates to evaporative coolers perse or to packs
or packings therefor, be limited to cooling towers.The Applicant is aware of different types of
packings for wet cooling towers, and for evaporative
coolers which work on the same principles as cooling
towers. These include packings comprising packs which
are known to the Applicant as "film packs", "trickle
packs" and "splash packs" respectively. In wet
cooling towers, the film packs and trickle packs
provide an increased surface area over which the water
can flow, thereby increasing the exposed surface area
of the water to promote its cooling, whereas the
splash packs provide impact surfaces for the water 
which, on impact with these surfaces breaks into
relatively small droplets, thereby increasing the
exposed surface area of the water to promote its
cooling.In pure splash pack configurations, horizontal
splash surfaces are provided. Splash packs require a
much larger volume to achieve the same cooling as a
film pack. Film packs comprise a large number of thin
plates which can be corrugated in various
configurations to increase their surface area to
provide as great a surface area as possible for a
given unit volume. The water to be cooled spreads
across the surface of the plates in the form of a thin
film, to create a maximum air water contact area, per
unit volume.Trickle packs are similar to film packs but
instead of providing an uninterrupted surface area
across which the water can spread, essentially
vertical apertured sheets or grids in close proximity
to each other, are provided. Water drops trickle down
the inter-aperture strips which are configured so as
to extend the distance that the droplets travel. The
grids in a trickle pack can be corrugated in a similar
fashion to the plates in a film pack.EP-A-0250061, which is the closest prior art

width, depth and length dimensions and comprises at

least two packing elements (10; 12; 50; 52; 80) of an
