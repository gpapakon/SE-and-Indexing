<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The deficiency of the known automatic tensioning and damping element is that it is subject to increased thermal ageing in the higher load range. The intention is that it should be possible to subject the new tensioning and damping element to higher loads. The technical problem consists in reducing heat-generating deformation components and the introduction of heat due to chain contact and in improving heat exchange with the environment. 2.2. The problem is solved by means of an automatic tensioning and damping element with an outer toothed ring corresponding to the chain and having teeth (1) which can be deformed elastically about their stress-free initial position and are open laterally in all deformation phases and by means of an annular profile (4) which runs around inside the base circle and merges with the roller beds (3) of the toothed ring in the base circle.

Automatic tensioner and damper for endless chain drives, particularly 
roller-chain drives, having an elastically deformable 

element situated between their slack runs and their tensioned 
runs that constantly and simult
aneously acts on both of 
said runs, and consisting of a deformable ring having a shape 

intermediate between that of an annulus or variations thereof 
created by radially deforming same, and a roughly elliptical 

ring in the form of a Cassini oval, having peripheral external 
teeth mating to, and capable of gripping, their chains, whose 

pitch-circle diameter or shortest axis exceeds the diameter of 
the pitch circle of the largest sprocket of said chain drive, 

characterized by peripheral, unflanked, curved teeth (1) that 
are elastically deformable from their unstressed initial position, 

and by a circumferential annular profile (4) running 
inside its root circle and merging into the roller lands (3) 

of said peripheral teeth at their root circle. 
Automatic tensioner and damper per Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that said annular profile (4) exhibits clearways (7) 

inset from its lateral centerline, B', extending from said 
root circle to points outside the circle defined by the depth 

of penetration of chain links into its lateral surfaces (9). 
Automatic tensioner and damper per Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
by roller lands (3) of width B' 
<
 0.9 B, where B is the 
inside width of their associated chain, and by beveled surfaces 

of width c 
>
 0.25 B', referenced to said inside width, 
B, of said associated chain, on both faces of their teeth, 

extending outward from the root circle of same. 
Automatic tensioner and damper per any of Claims 1 through 3, 
characterized by the fact that the diameter of the addendum 

circle of said peripheral teeth is less than that of their 
pitch circle, and that said roller lands (3) are inclined at 

an angle of β 
<
 150°.
