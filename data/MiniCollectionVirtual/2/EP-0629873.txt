<ABSTRACT>
The magnetic field assembly of a magnetic resonance imaging device includes an 
annular superconducting magnet (10) which is mounted within a toroidal vacuum ve
ssel (24). 
A cylindrical member (26) defines a central bore (12) through which the superconducting 

magnets generate a uniform, static magnetic field. A cylindrical, dielectric former (46) is 
mounted in the bore displaced by an annular gap (58) from the cylindrical member. A 

shimset (60) for shimming the uniformity of the magnetic field is mounted in the gap (58). 
A radio frequency coil (32) is mounted within the cylindrical member defining a patient 

receiving examination region. An RF shield (34) is mounted around the exterior peripheral 
surface of the former. Primary gradient coils (50, 52,54) are mounted around and potted to 

the exterior of the dielectric former around the RF shield. Gradient shield or secondary coils 
(74, 76, 78) are potted around an exterior of the cylindrical member within the vacuum 

chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined self shielded gradient coil and shimset. It finds
particular application in conjunction with self shielded gradient coil assemblies for magnetic
resonance imaging apparatus and will be described with particular reference thereto.
However, it will be appreciated that the present invention will also find application in
conjunction with magnetic resonance spectroscopy systems and other applications which
require RF fields and gradient magnetic fields.Heretofore, magnetic resonance imagers have included a superconducting magnet
which generated a temporally constant primary magnetic field. The superconducting magnet
was encased in a toroidal vacuum vessel or dewar that included a central cylindrical bore
through which the primary magnetic field was generated. As generated, the primary magnetic
field commonly had limited non-uniformities. Active or passive shims were mounted to the
inside surface of the cylindrical bore to correct the non-uniformities and render the primary
magnetic field substantially uniform within the bore. Although active shims in the form of
resistive coils were sometimes used, 
passive shims in the form of small pieces of steel about an
inch square and 0.010 inches thick were more common.There are several important subsystems of the MRI
system that are placed within the cylindrical bore of the
primary magnet. Usually the structure closest to the bore
is a shimset. The shimset may consist of coils carrying a
specified amount of current or ferromagnetic material
placed so as to reduce the non-uniformity of the primary
magnetic field. The next inward structure is a set of
coils for generating the x, y, and z-gradient fields used
for MRI. Within the gradient coil structure is the RF coil
and the object to be imaged. One alternative to this
arrangement has been to place superconducting shim coils
within the cold region of the magnet. This placement of
shimset serves to separate the shims as far as possible
from the imaging volume which is desirable when removing
low order field inhomogeneity.One of the difficulties was that the gradient
magnetic fields generated for the MRI also induced eddy
currents in the magnet structures. These eddy currents in
turn produced their own magnetic fields thus interfering
with the imaging process. The induced eddy currents can be
compensated for with pre-emphasis only to the extent that
the pre-emphasis perfectly mimic the gradient fields.
Since there are some very cold conductive surfaces within
the cryostat to minimize
