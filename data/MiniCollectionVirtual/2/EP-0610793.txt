<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel condensed 
morpholine derivatives. Compounds having an indolobenzoxazine skeleton 
were disclosed in USP-4,493,836 and USP-4,318,910 by 
Lucien Nedelec et al., and in USP-4,238,486 by James H. 
Jones, in which anti-Parkinson and antihypertensive 
activity are indicated. In these known compounds, the 
carbon atom at 1a position of the indolobenzoxazine 
skeleton is unsubstituted. Pain is a complaint due to physical or mental 
causes, and man has endeavored, since ancient times, to 
synthesize drugs capable of eliminating or relieving 
the pain. Stimuli causing pain include, among others, 
chemical, electrical, thermal and mechanical ones. 
Pain signals given to primary sensory nerve by these 
stimuli are transmitted to cerebral cortex through 
spinal cord, where the sensation is recorded as pain. 
In the transmission of pain, various neuropeptides are 
participated. Above all, substance-P (SP) is a peptide 
consisting of 11 amino acids belonging to tachykinins, 
which is counted as one of the substances of 
transmitting information from primary sensory nerve to 
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which participates 
in, other than pain, central nervous system diseases, 
inflammatory diseases. Therefore, drugs capable of 
suppressing the stimuli transmitting the action of SP 
can be used as excellent analgesics. As a strong analgesic which has been known best, 
mention is made of a narcotic analgesic, e.g. morphine, 
and a number of its related compounds have been 
synthesized. Most of these drugs, however, cause  
 
tolerance and physical and mental dependency, and the 
strength of such tolerance and dependency is assumed to 
be in direct proportion to the analgesic activity. 
Circumstances being such as above, development of non-narcotic 
analgesic which does not act on a morphine-acceptor 
has been ardently desired. The present inventors found that novel 
indolobenzoxazine derivatives modified by introducing 
into their 1a-position a hydrocarbon residue such as 
lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl 
presented analgesic actions in various animal models, 
and then conducted further investigation on the finding 
to complete the present invention. Thus, this invention relates to: 
a compound (I) represented by the formula 
wherein X is hydrogen or a substituent; R¹ is an 
optionally substituted hydrocarbon residue; R² and R³ 
are respectively hydrogen or a substituent; and -----shows 
a single bond or a double bond, or a 
pharmacologically acceptable acid
