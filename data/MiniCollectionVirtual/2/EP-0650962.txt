Process for the production of a compound of
formula:



in which:

R
1
 represents hydrogen or methyl; and
A and B each independently represent a straight or
branched hydrocarbon chain having from 2 to 5 carbon

atoms,

by reaction of at least one (meth)acrylate of formula:


in which:

R
1
 has the above meaning; and
R
2
 represents a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl group,

with a heterocyclic alcohol of formula:


in which A and B have the above meanings,

in the presence of at least one magnesium alkoxide as
catalyst.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a magnesium alkoxide Mg(OR)
2
 is used, R representing
a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl residue. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that R represents ethyl or n-propyl.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the catalyst is used in an amount

of 0.5 to 4 mol% relative to the heterocyclic alcohol of
formula (III).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the reaction is carried out at a

temperature between 85 and 105Â°C.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that a molar ratio of the (meth)acrylate

of formula (II) to the heterocyclic alcohol of formula
(III) which is between 1.1 and 7.0 is used.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the reaction is carried out for a

period of between 3 and 15 hours and at a pressure not
exceeding atmospheric pressure.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the

presence of at least one polymerization inhibitor chosen
from phenothiazine, hydroquinone methyl ether, di-tert-butylcatechol,

hydroquinone, p-anilinophenol, para-phenylenediamine
and their mixtures in all proportions.
