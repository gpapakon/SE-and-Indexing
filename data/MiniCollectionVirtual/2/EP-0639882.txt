<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement for closing the slots (which are filled with conductor rods (4) or coils) of the laminated stator core (5) of an electrical machine by means of slot closure pieces comprises an upper prismatic body (1) on whose underneath (8) a surface runs in an inclined manner, and a lower prismatic body (2). The upper surface (9), facing the upper body, runs in the opposite direction to the gradient of the lower surface (8) of the other body, the actual wedging being carried out by relative displacement of the two prismatic bodies (1,2) with respect to one another. In order to be able to utilise the elasticity of the upper body (1) in the transverse direction optimally, the force of the conductor rod (4) or coil on the upper prismatic body (1) over its entire length is introduced essentially only in its central section. In consequence, relatively large spring movements in the radial direction are available which, for their part, can better compensate for seating phenomena in winding construction. In this way, maintenance intervals are extended, and the availability of the machine is increased.

Arrangement for sealing the slots (6), which 
are filled with conductor bars (4) or coils, in the 

laminated stator core (5) of an electrical machine by 
means of slot sealing elements, which each comprise at 

least one upper prismatic body (1), on whose underneath 
a surface runs in an inclined manner, and a lower 

prismatic body (2), whose upper surface, facing the 
upper body (1), runs inclined in the opposite direction 

to the gradient of the lower surface of the upper body, 
it being possible to produce the actual wedging by 

relative displacement of the two prismatic bodies (1, 
2) with respect to one another, characterized in that 

the force is introduced from the conductor bar (4) or 
coil to the upper prismatic body (1), essentially only 

in its central section, over its entire length. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the said lower surface (8) in the upper 

prismatic body (1) is curved in a concave manner and in 
that the said upper surface (9) in the lower prismatic 

body (2) is curved in a convex manner, the radius of 
curvature (r
K
) of the lower surface (8) being greater 
than the radius of curvature (r
Z
) of the upper 
surface (9). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the radius of curvature (r
K
) of the lower 
surface (8) is at least 5 % greater than than [sic]
 the 
radius of curvature (r
Z
) of the upper surface (9). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, in the central section on its surface (9) 

facing the upper prismatic body (1), the lower 
prismatic body (2) has a strip-like projection (12), 

extending in the longitudinal direction of the slot, 
which is preferably constructed integrally with the 

lower prismatic body (2). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, in the central section on its surface (8') 

facing the lower prismatic body (2), the upper 
prismatic body (1) has a strip-like projection (12),  

 
extending in the longitudinal direction of the slot, 

which is preferably constructed integrally with the 
upper prismatic body (1). 
Arrangement according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the strip-like projection (12) is 

a maximum of a third of the slot width. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that an intermediate element (13) is provided 

between the conductor bar (4) and the lower prismatic 
body, the upper surface (9) of which intermed
iate 
element, facing the lower prismatic body (2), is curved 

in a convex manner, and in that the lower surface, 
facing the intermediate element (13), of the lower body 

(2) is curved in a concave manner, the radius of 
curvature (r
K
) of the lower surface of the lower 
prismatic body being greater than the radius of 

curvature (r
Z
) of the upper surface of the intermediate 
element (13). 
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the radius of curvature (r
K
) of the lower 
surface (17) of the lower prismatic body (2) is at 

least 5 % greater than the radius of curvature (r
Z
) of 
the upper surface (16) of the intermediate element.
