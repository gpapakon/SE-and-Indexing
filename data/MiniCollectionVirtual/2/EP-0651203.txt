<ABSTRACT>
Gas burner, for stove or cooker hob, comprising a combustion head (1, 101) and a mixing chamber (11, 111), said head having a porous radiant element (4, 104), said chamber (11, 111) being arranged below the radiant element (4, 104) and receiving air and gas for feeding said radiant element with an air/gas mixture, at least one element (12, 112) forming an obstacle to the circulation of the air/gas mixture being arranged in said chamber (11, 111), characterised in that the element forming an obstacle (12, 112) defines, with the internal faces of the mixing chamber (11, 111), a circulation blade, in which the air/gas mixture is forced to circulate, being in contact with said internal faces so as to cool them.

<CLAIMS>
A gas burner for a cooker or a hob, the burner comprising a
combustion head (1, 101) and a mixing chamber (11, 111), said head

having a porous radiant element (4, 104), said chamber (11, 111)
being disposed beneath the radiant element (4, 104) and receiving air

and gas to feed said radiant element with an air/gas mixture, at
least one element (12, 112) forming an obstacle to the flow of the

air/gas mixture being disposed in said chamber (11, 111), said
obstacle-forming element (12, 112) sending the air/gas mixture over

the side faces of the mixing chamber (11, 111) to cool them, the
burner being characterized in that the general external outline of

the obstacle-forming elements (12, 112) is analogous to the internal
outline of the mixing chamber (11, 111) and co-operates therewith to

define a flow slot through which the air/gas mixture is forced to
flow before reaching the radiant element, so as to exchange heat by

convection with the side wall(s) of the mixing chamber (11, 111).
A burner according to claim 1, characterized in that the obstacle-forming
element is a bell (12, 112), said bell having a top (13)

surrounded by side walls (14) extending from said top (13) towards a

bottom (8) of the mixing chamber (11) on which said bell is carried,
the inside of the bell (12, 112) being fed with air and with gas, the

mixture formed in said bell (12, 112) escaping therefrom in the
vicinity of the bottom (8) of the mixing chamber, and then rising to

the radiant element (4) by flowing in the flow slot defined between
the side wall(s) of the bell (12, 112) and of the mixing chamber

(11)Â·
A burner according to claim 2, characterized in that the
combustion head (1) can be moved away from the bottom (8) of the

mixing chamber (11), at least one spring-forming element (23) being
compressed between the bottom (8) of the mixing chamber (11) and an

abutment member (21) extending between said spring (23) and the
combustion head (1), said spring-forming element (23) being disposed

inside the bell (12, 112), the burner also including locking means
for opposing the action of said spring-forming element. 
A burner according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the bell
(12, 112) has at least one notch (17a) through which there passes a

lateral pipe (17) for feeding the mixing chamber (11) with air and/or
with gas.
A burner according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the mixing chamber is fed with air and with gas through its

bottom, and in that the combustion head has a skirt bearing via a
sealing ring on said bottom, said skirt co-operating with said bottom

and the radiant element to define the mixing chamber.
A burner according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the combustion head (1) is carried by a body (2) extending from a

bottom (8) of the mixing chamber (11), said body (2) co-operating
with the combustion head (1) to define said mixing chamber (11).
A burner according to claim 6, characterized in that said body (2)
has an opening for feeding the mixing chamber (11) laterally with an

air/gas mixture, the height of said body (2) from said bottom (8) to
the combustion head being just greater than the height of said

opening.
A burner according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
it includes an electrode (19), part of which projects from the front

face of the radiant element (4), said electrode (19) being received
in a tubular element (18) extending inside the mixing chamber (11) to

the radiant element (4), said tubular element (18) insulating the
air/gas mixture electrically from said electrode (19).
A burner according to claim 8, characterized in that the tubular
element (18) passes through the radiant element (4) and is thermally

insulated therefrom by a ring (20) of ceramic adhesive in which it is
embedded.
A burner according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the
electrode (19) is positioned in the center of the radiant element

(4). 
A burner according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the radiant element (4) is a membrane of porous material made of

sintered refractory metal fibers, said membrane having a multitude of
perforations.
