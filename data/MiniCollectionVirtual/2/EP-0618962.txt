<ABSTRACT>
A thymidine phosphorylase for use in medicine. The thymidine phosphorylase may be targeted to a selected location, for example by conjugating it to an antibody directed to a cell-specific antigen. The thymidine phosphorylase modulates cell growth and/or promotes chemotaxis. Cell growth can be increased for wound healing or decreased for tumour therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compounds for use in medicine.Thymidine phosphorylase (thymine: orthophosphate deoxyribosyltransferase,
EC 2.4.2.4) is a cytosolic enzyme which catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis
of thymidine and other pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribosides, except for 4-amino
substituted compounds such as 2'-deoxycytidine, as follows:-
The phosphorolytic and synthetic reactions may also be used to transfer a
deoxyribose moiety of one deoxynucleoside to form a second deoxynucleoside
in a nucleoside deoxyribosyl transferase reaction (Schwartz, M. (1971) Eur. J.
Biochem. 21, 191-198).Thymidine phosphorylase has been purified and characterised from a number
of micro-organisms (Schwartz, M. (1971) Eur. J. Biochem. 21, 191-198,
Schwartz, M. (1978) Methods Enzymol. 51, 442-445; Avraham, Y. et al (1990)
Biochim. Biophys. Acta1040, 287-293; Hoffee, P.A. et al (1978) Methods
Enzymol.51, 437-442) and from human tissues (Desgranges, C. et al (1981)
Biochim. Biophys. Acta.654, 211-218; Kubilus, J. et al (1978) Biochim. 
Biophys. Acta527, 221-228; Yoshimura et al (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta1034, 107-113). Escherichia coli thymidine phosphorylase is a dimer of 90kD
composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 45kD
(Schwartz, M. (1978) Methods Enzymol. 51, 442-445; Walter, M. et al (1990)
J. Biol. Chem.265, 14016-14022). The three-dimensional crystal structure of
Escherichia coli has been determined to resolution of 2.8 Å (Walter, M. et al
(1990) J. Biol. Chem.265, 14016-14022). The monomer subunit consists of
a small α-helical domain and a large α/β domain. The active site, which binds
both thymidine and phosphate, has been located in a cleft between the two
domains.Human thymidine phosphorylase has been identified in many tissues including
lymphocytes, heart, spleen, lung and placenta (Yoshimura, A. et al (1990)
Biochim. Biophys. Acta.1034, 107-113) and purified from both placenta
(Yoshimura, A. et al (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta.1034, 107-113; Kubilus,
J. (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 527, 221-228) and platelets (Desgranges, C.
(1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta654, 211-218). It has been suggested that
thymidine phosphorylase plays an essential role in maintaining intracellular
thymidine homeostasis (Shaw, T. et al (1988) Mutant Res.200, 99-116). The
thymidine salvage pathway requires the action of a permease to transport
thymidine across the lipid bilayer. Intracellular thymidine is then
phosphorylated by thymidine kinase, generating thymidine monophosphate 
(TMP) which is further
