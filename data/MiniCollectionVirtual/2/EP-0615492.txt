<ABSTRACT>
The wheel assembly comprises: a wheel (1) with a hub (2) having a diameter (D1) associable to a group of axles exhibiting differing diameters over a determined range of said axle diameters, the hub (2) affording at least one seating (3) to receive a portion of a fixing means (7) of a bushing (4) introduced internally to the hub (2); a series of bushings having internal diameters which are equal to a diameter (D2) of corresponding axles (5) on which the wheel (1) is to be keyed, and all having an external diameter which is slightly smaller than the diameter (D1) of the hub (2), and exhibiting on an external surface at least one seating (6) for fixing means (7) for fixing the bushing (4) to the wheel (1); the fixing means (7) being constituted by elastically deformable elements (11) which are positionable on conformations having different radial developments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an assembly for centering 
wheels of motor vehicles on single axles from a 
determined range of axles, each presenting a 
different diameter. Motor vehicle wheels are produced with different 
hub diameters in accordance with various axles 
they are destined to equip. In order not to have too large a range of wheels 
in production, the wheels are produced in 
subdivisions of determined measures, relative to 
the hub diameters, so as to correspond each single 
wheel size with groups comprising several axles 
with different diameters, all falling however 
within a certain interval, equal to the difference 
between one size wheel and the next. Each wheel size corresponds to diameters of axles 
varying from a minimum up to a maximum, which  
 
maximum corresponds to the axle by having a 
diameter which is practically the same as that of 
the wheel hub. Leaving aside for a moment axles having the 
maximum diameter, in order to have a correct 
positioning of the wheels it is always necessary 
to eliminate excesses of play which exist between 
the axle and the wheel hub. At present, to adapt the wheels to the axles, 
closed metal rings or plastic bushings are used, 
which are cemented to the wheel hubs so as to 
reduce play between hub and axles and to set the 
hubs with respect to the axles. This wheel centring method has some drawbacks with 
regard to the mounting speed and correct wheel 
setting. Much time is needed to cement the bushings or 
rings on the wheel hub, with a consequent increase 
in labour costs, and even then the setting 
obtained depends very much on the experience and 
ability of the operative. Further, there is an increase in relative play 
between the parts since not only is there the  
 
normal play necessary for the introduction of the 
axle into the wheel, there is also the play 
necessary for the introduction of the bushing on 
the wheel hub, not to mention allowance for the 
error due to the distribution of the layer of 
cement used for the fixing. Another method used for equipping vehicles with 
wheels having hubs that are of substantially 
greater diameter than the axle of the vehicle (or 
in any case where there is a certain play between 
hub and wheel axle) is that described in U.S. 
patent no. 2,969,256, filed on the 24th February 
1958, which envisages an interpositioning between 
the axle and wheel of a first ring having an 
external diameter which is about equal to the 
internal diameter of the hub, and which has an 
internal diameter which can be

<CLAIMS>
A wheel assembly for motor vehicles, comprising a 
wheel (1) and at least one bushing (4) for 

positioning wheels or the like on one of a 
determined range of axles exhibiting different 

diameters comprising:
 
   a wheel (1) exhibiting a hub (2) of a diameter 

(D1), which wheel (1) is associable to a maximum 
diameter axle of the said group of axles, where on 

the hub (2) there is at least one seating (3) 
aimed at partially receiving mechanical fixing 

means (7) of a bushing (4) introduced internally 
of the hub (2), characterized in that the said
 
   bushing (4, or 4a, or 4b) having an 

internal diameter which is about the same as a 
diameter of a corresponding axle which the wheel 

(1) will be keyed on and 
having an external diameter which is slightly 

smaller than the diameter (D1) of the hub (2), 
affords on said external 

surface at least one seating (6) to receive  
 

mechanical fixing means (7) for fixing the bushing 
(4, or 4a, or 4b) to the wheel (1); the said 


fixing means (7) being 
constituted by elastically deformable elements 

stabily insertable in the seating (6) exhibited by the 
bushing (4) and elastically deformable so as to be 

fully received in the seating (6) during an 
introduction phase of the bushing (4) in the hub 

(2), thereafter expanding in the seating (3) 
provided on the internal surface of the hub (2) 

when the bushing (4) is completely inserted in the 
hub (2), a portion of the said fixing means remaining 

in the seating (6) of the said bushing (4) after the 
said expanding in the seating (3). 
A wheel assembly, as in claim 1, characterised in 
that the fixing means of the bushing (4) to the 

wheel (1) are constituted by an open ring (7), 
elastically deformable at an open portion by a 

nearing of ends (11) of the said open ring (7), 
which open ring (7) in a rest position exhibits an 

external diameter which is greater than an 
external diameter (D2) of the hub (2) and in an 

applied position exhibits an internal diameter 
which is slightly larger than the external 

diameter of the bushing (4).  
 
A wheel assembly for wheel positioning, as in 
claim 1, characterised in that the fixing means of 

the bushing (4) to the wheel (1) are constituted 
by at least one element (8) which is radially 

slidable internally of the seating (6) provided on 
the bushing (4) between one position, assumed 

during an insertion phase of the bushing (4) into 
the hub (2), wherein the element (8) is totally 

inserted in the said seating (6) and another position 
wherein the elements (8) is forced by elastic 

reaction of a spring or like organ (9) inserted in 
the bushing (4) to project from the bushing (4) by 

at least a portion of itself, which portion is 
conformed in such a way as to be complementary to 

the seating (3) present on the hub (2) and to be 
insertable in the seating (3) when the bushing (4) 

is completely inserted in the hub (2). 
A wheel assembly as in claim 1, characterised in 
that the said bushing (4, or 4a, or 4b) 

exhibits a colouring in relation to 
the corresponding diameters of axle 

relative to the said bushing (4, or 4a, 
or 4b).
