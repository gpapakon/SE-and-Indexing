<ABSTRACT>
A computer editing system graphical user interface 
includes at least one central processing unit (CPU) coupled 

through appropriate input/output (I/O) circuitry to input 
devices, such as a cursor control device, and a display 

device. The CPU is further coupled to a storage device for 
the storage of data and programs including a database. The 

database comprises a plurality of source logs indicating a 
beginning point and an ending point defining all the 

available source material for the corresponding source log. 
An output sequence of selected source material is displayed 

on a timeline as source material blocks, wherein the source 
material blocks are defined by a head 
point and a tail 
point. Through the computer editing system, a user performs 

a variety of re-editing functions to trim existing source 
material and to insert new source material on the timeline. 

When performing a re-edit function, all available source 
material blocks for a source log selected for re-edit is 

displayed. The selected source block displayed is visually 
distinguished by size, colour and relative layering. By 

distinguishing the selected source block for which re-edit 
is desired, the user is permitted to clearly view all the 

available source material for the selected source block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
displaying and editing graphic information, and more
particularly, the present invention relates to a computer
controlled display system for editing a multi-media
production.Over the past decade, a variety of graphic user
interfaces have been developed to ease human interaction
with computer systems. Many display systems utilize
metaphors in the design of the interface as a way of
maximising human familiarity, and conveying information
between the user and the computer. it is common for
computer systems incorporating so-called "object oriented"
display systems to utilize multiple "windows" on a display
in which combinations of text and graphics are disposed.
The display systems utilize familiar metaphors, such as
desktops, control panels, notebooks and the like, such that
the interface takes advantage of existing human mental
structures to permit a user to draw upon the metaphor
analogy to understand the requirements of the particular
computer system.It is well known that designing around a familiar
metaphor helps reduce human learning time. (See for example,
Patrick Chan, "Learning Considerations in User Interface
Design: The Room Model", Report CS-84-16, University of
Waterloo Computer Science Department, Onatario, Canada, July
1984, and the references cited therein.) The ability to
operate on images or objects which relate the user to actual
objects on, for example, a desktop, results in a stronger
man-machine interface. (See for example, D.Robson, "Object
Oriented Software Systems", BYTE, August 1991, page 74,
Vol.6, No.8; L.Tesler, "The Smalltalk Environment", BYTE,
August 1981, page 90, Vol.6, No.8; and Smith, et al., "Star 
User Interface: An Overview", National Computer Conference,
1982).Research in interface design using metaphors in
man-machine interfaces may be applied to computer controlled
editing systems to incorporate and integrate various
production media resources, such as special effects, music,
graphics and the like. In the case of an editing system, a
variety of resources must be integrated, scheduled and
coordinated with one another to obtain a complete
multi-media product. Users of computer controlled editing
systems are generally familiar with the individual resources
and the coordination of those resources to develop a
finished product. Accordingly, the "windows" utilized in a
video editing system may be designed such that the metaphor
of the interface takes advantage of the knowledge of the
user in operating discrete
