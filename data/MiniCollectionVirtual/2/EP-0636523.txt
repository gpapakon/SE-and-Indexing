<ABSTRACT>
In a steering lock device, a key cylinder (9) is removed 
from a body (1) with the key rotor (8) of the key cylinder (9) turned to 

the "LOCK" position, a regulating tappet (17) is moved in the 
direction of the arrow A, so that a preventing member (21) is 

engaged with the engaging groove (14) of an engaging body (13). As a 
result of the engagement, the engaging body (13) and accordingly a 

cam shaft (2) are prevented from being turned. Even if, in this 
case, the regulating lever (17) is broken with the key cylinder (9) 

removed from the body (1), the turning of the cam shaft (2) is 
maintained inhibited by the preventing member (21), and therefore 

the turning of the cam shaft (2) is positively prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steering lock device which 
locks a steering shaft and accordingly a steering wheel with 
the key rotor of its key cylinder turned to the locking 
position. A steering lock device for a motor vehicle is generally 
designed as follows: When, after the key rotor of the key 
cylinder in its body is turned to the locking position (the 
"LOCK" position) with the key, the latter is removed from the 
key rotor, its lock bar engages with the steering shaft system, 
so that the steering shaft and the steering wheel are locked; 
that is, they are inhibited from being turned. When the key rotor is turned to an operating position 
(any one of the "ACC", "ON" or "START" positions) with the key 
inserted in it, the lock bar is moved by the cam protrusion of 
a cam shaft which is turned together with the key rotor, so 
that the lock bar is disengaged from the steering shaft system. 
As a result, the steering shaft and accordingly the steering 
wheel are unlocked. When the cam shaft is turned, the ignition 
switch is operated. As is apparent from the above description, with the 
steering lock device of this type, the steering wheel and the  
 
ignition switch cannot be operated without the key. Thus, the 
use of the steering lock device is effective in preventing the 
vehicle from being stolen. However, the steering lock device suffers from the 
following difficulty: When, with the steering shaft locked, 
the key cylinder is removed from the body by some method, then 
the cam shaft is exposed in the body. If, under this 
condition, the cam shaft is turned to the operating position 
with a special tool, then it becomes possible to disengage the 
lock bar from the steering shaft system and to operate the 
ignition. In order to overcome the above-described difficulty, a 
steering lock device is proposed under Unexamined Japanese 
Utility Model Application Hei. 4-134773. The steering lock device thus proposed includes an 
engaging body having an engaging groove which is turned 
together with the cam shaft; a preventing member provided in 
the body in such a manner that it is movable between an 
engaging position and a releasing position; and a regulating 
member which engages with the preventing member when the latter 
has been moved to the engaging position. When the steering lock device is in the normal state 
with the key cylinder accommodated in the body, the preventing 
member is held at the releasing position being pushed by the 
key cylinder. When, with the steering shaft locked, the key

<CLAIMS>
A steering lock device comprising: 
   a body which mounted on a vehicle; 

   a cam shaft having a cam protrusion on the cylindrical 
surface thereof, the cam shaft being rotatably provided in the 

body; 
   a key cylinder having a key rotor which is turned with 

a key, the key cylinder being set in the body in such a manner 
that the key cylinder is turned together with the cam shaft; 

   an engaging body having an engaging groove, the 
engaging body being turned together with the cam shaft; 

   a regulating lever provided in the body in such a 
manner that the regulating lever is axially movable between a 

regulating position and a regulation releasing position; and 
   a preventing member movably provided in the body and 

urged toward the engaging groove. 
A steering lock device as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
when the key cylinder is set in the body, the regulating lever, 

being depressed by the key cylinder, is moved to the regulating 
position, and when the key cylinder is removed from the body, 

the regulating lever is moved to the regulation releasing 
position. 
A steering lock device as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the regulating position includes a primary regulating position 

and an auxiliary regulating position. 
A steering lock device as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
when the regulating member is positioned at the regulating 

position, the preventing member is held at an engagement 
releasing position where the engagement of the preventing 

member with the engaging groove is released, and when the cam 
shaft is positioned at a predetermined position, the preventing 

member is moved to an engaging position where the preventing 
member is engaged with the engaging groove with the regulating 

member being moved to the regulation releasing position, to 
prevent the engaging body from turning. 
A steering lock device as claimed in claim 1, further 
comprising: a locking member which is moved by the cam 

protrusion as the cam shaft turns, the locking member 
adapted to lock a steering shaft with the key rotor turned 

to the predetermined position.
