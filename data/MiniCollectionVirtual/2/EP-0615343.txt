<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement for generating a tuning voltage for an oscillator in a radio receiver with the aid of a phase-locked loop, the loop filter is switched over in such a manner that the cut-off frequency defined by a loop gain of 1 is changed by the switch-over without the relationship between gain and frequency significantly changing in the area of the cut-off frequency.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for generating a tuning
voltage for an oscillator in a broadcast receiver with

the aid of a phase locked loop, characterized in that
the loop filter (23; 24; 31, 32, 33) is switched in

such a manner that the cut-off frequency defined by a
loop gain of 1 is changed by the switching without

significantly changing the dependence of the gain on
the frequency within the range of the cut-off

frequency.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a number of loop filters (23; 24)

having a different cut-off frequency are provided, the
inputs of which can be optionally connected to a phase

detector (5).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that in each case one loop filter (23;

24) is connected in series with a low-pass filter (25,
26) and that the outputs of the low-pass filters (25,

26) can be optionally connected to a control input of
the oscillator (1).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the loop filters (C11, C21, Rll;

C12, C22, R21) are connected to a common low-pass
filter (R12, C13).
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims
2 to 4, characterized in that a resistor (44) is

arranged between the inputs of two loop filters (C11,
C21, R11; C12, C22, R21). 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the resistor (44) is selected to

be of such a magnitude that the low-pass filter formed
by it and a connected capacitor of the loop filter has

a cut-off frequency which is lower than the cut-off
frequency of the loop filter having the lower cut-off

frequency.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the loop filter (31, 32, 33) is

an active filter, the frequency-determining sections
(32; 33) of which are switchable.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims
5 and 6, characterized in that signals are applied to

one of the two loop filters (C11, C21, R11; C12, C22,
R21) in dependence on the state of recovery.
