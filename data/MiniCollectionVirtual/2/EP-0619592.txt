<ABSTRACT>
The two arc extinction chambers (84), (86) include a common end plate (102), of conducting material, arranged opposite fixed contacts (34), (36), and serving both as an element for shunting the moving contact (24) at the end of opening travel after switching of the arc onto the said end plate (102), and as an element for series electrical coupling of the two arc extinction chambers (84), (86). Application: Multi-pole circuit breaker with electrodynamic repulsion.

An electrical circuit breaker with a moulded insulating case (12) having a breaking 
module (14) comprising p
er pole : 

two arc extinguishing chambers (84, 86), arranged side by side, and each having a 
stack of metallic deionization plates, 
an intermediate partitioning wall (92) made of insulating material, and inserted 
between the two arc extinguishing chambers (84, 86), 
a pair of stationary contacts (34, 36) cooperating with a fork-shaped movable 
contact (24) positioned astride said wall (92), 
and an operating mechanism (60) of the movable contact (24) to open and close the 
circuit breaker, 
 
characterized in that the two arc extinguishing chambers (84, 86) comprise a 

common end plate (102), made of conducting material, located opposite from the 
stationary contacts (34, 36), and acting both as shunting component of the movable 

contact (24) at the end of the opening travel after the arc has been switched onto said 
end plate (102), and as a component for electrical coupling in series of the two arc 

extinguishing chambers (84, 86), that each breaking module (14) is formed by a 
parallelepipedic monoblock cartridge (16) made of plastic material, housing the two 

stationary contacts (34, 36), the two arc extinguishing chambers (84, 86), the 
common end plate (102), and a pair of connecting terminal strips (38, 42), that the 

intermediate partitioning wall (92) subdivides the inside of the cartridge (16) into two 
adjacent compartments (94, 96) open on the side where the base plate (18) is 

situated, and that the movable contact (24) penetrates into the two compartments 
(94, 96) via a passage orifice (22) located opposite the base plate (18). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the end plate (102) 
extends parallel to the elementary plates of the two arc extinguishing chambers (84, 

86), that each stationary contact (34, 36) is extended by a metallic electrode (98, 100) 
acting as arcing hom, and that said insulating partitioning wall (92) is arranged  

 
between the two electrodes (98, 100) in the mid-plane perpendicular to the end plate 

(102). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the end plate 
(102) comprises two V-shaped notches (104, 106) respectively aligned with the 

notches of the plates of the arc extinguishing chambers (84, 86). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 3, characterized in that the end plate (102) is 
drilled with holes (112) making the outlet of the arc extinguishing chambers (84, 86) 

communicate with a channel (88) for outlet of the breaking gases. 
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the common end 
plate (102) extends over the whole width of the cartridge (16), and that each arc 

extinguishing chamber (84, 86) bears on edges (110) of the corresponding 
compartment (94, 96), said plates being perpendicular to the base plate (18).
