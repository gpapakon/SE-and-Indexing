<ABSTRACT>
A diamond/carbon/carbon composite (10) is provided 
comprising a carbon/carbon composite (12) having a 

polycrystalline diamond film (14) deposited thereon. The 
carbon/carbon composite (12) comprises a preform of interwoven 

carbon fibers comprising vapor grown carbon fibers. The 
preferred method of producing the composite involves chemical 

vapor infiltration of the pyrolytic carbon into the interstices 
of the preform, followed by microwave plasma enhanced chemical 

vapor deposition of the diamond film (14) on the carbon/carbon 
composite (12). The resulting diamond/carbon/carbon composite 

(10) is useful as an integral dielectric heat sink for electronic 
systems in spacecraft, aircraft and supercomputers due to its 

thermal management properties. Such a heat sink can be made by 
depositing metallic circuits on the diamond layer (14) of the 

diamond/carbon/carbon composite (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a unique diamond/carbon/carbon 
composite useful as an integral dielectric heat sink, and 
a method for making such a composite. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a diamond/carbon/carbon composite 
formed by depositing polycrystalline diamond on a carbon/carbon 
composite, and to an integral dielectric heat sink formed by 
depositing a metallic film on the diamond layer of the resulting 
diamond/carbon/carbon composite. In recent years, demand has increased for high power, high 
density electronic devices used for advanced systems such as 
aircraft, spacecraft, and supercomputers. One known solution to 
this problem entails fabricating multichip module (MCM) circuitry 
with greater circuit density and more efficient electrical 
performance. However, while this process provides superior 
electrical performance, the increased circuit density raises the 
power density within the MCM, increasing the heat dissipation 
requirements. Ongoing improvements to heat sink materials must 
be made to avoid heat-induced failure of such electronic devices. Semiconductor bases have been produced using composites 
comprising fibers, fiber bundles, and woven fiber bundles of 
graphite, boron, tungsten and glass. However, such composites do 
not have a very high thermal conductivity. Carbon fiber reinforcements have made significant 
improvements in properties of composites of various polymeric, 
metal, and ceramic matrices. However, a limiting factor in the 
use of such fibers is their highly anisotropic thermal 
conductivity and their inability to match the coefficient of 
thermal expansion of the circuit material, which is typically 
silicon or gallium arsenide.  
 Various processes have been developed in recent years to 
produce synthetic diamonds for use as heat sinks in the 
electronics field. Although diamond is electrically insulating, 
diamond has the highest thermal conductivity found in nature. 
Thus, diamond is an ideal heat sink material for semiconductor 
devices. Diamond has other desirable properties including high 
hardness, high dielectric strength and breakdown fields, chemical 
stability, and a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) which is 
suitable for matching a wide range of CTE's of materials to which 
the composite is mated. One process for synthesizing diamond is to use microwave 
assisted chemical vapor deposition to deposit diamond on silicon 
substrates. Such a process is described in Badzian et al, "Vapor 
Deposition Synthesis of Diamond
