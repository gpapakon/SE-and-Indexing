<DESCRIPTION>
This process relates to the preparation of carbon-carbon composite 
materials. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of materials 
providing improved carbon yields useful for densifying fibrous structures of carbon 
during formation of carbon-carbon composites. Specifically, this invention relates 
to the use of particular multi-functional benzoxazine compounds to densify 
structural networks formed by carbon fibers in the process of fabricating carbon 
fiber reinforced carbonaceous composites. Carbon-carbon composites, that is, carbonized material reinforced with 
carbon fibers consisting essentially of elemental carbon and some graphitic 
materials can be prepared in a wide variety of shapes exhibiting a number of 
unique properties. Importantly, such materials possess unusual resistance to high 
temperature environments, for example, they show thermal stability as a solid, and 
due to their high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion behavior, they 
resist thermal shock The materials also maintain a high degree of strength and 
stiffness when exposed to high temperatures. Such properties are explained by the 
high refractive nature of elemental carbon and by the high strength and stiffness 
of fibers formed from amorphous and graphitic carbon. In view of the preceding, therefore, it is not surprising that carbon-carbon 
composites have found, and will continue in the future to find broad use in 
lightweight, aerospace applications. They are, for example, widely used in the 
field of space vehicle re-entry, and in this regard, the space shuttle employs  
 
carbon-carbon composites in its nose cone and wing edges. Disc brakes for high 
performance aircraft provide another application depending upon the unique 
properties of carbon-carbon composites. While carbon-carbon composites possess many valuable characteristics, 
including those mentioned, they suffer from the disadvantage of being expensive 
to fabricate; thus their use is normally restricted to applications in which 
properties, rather than cost are of primary importance. The high cost of the 
composites is due to an important degree to their method of fabrication, which 
necessarily involves multi-step processing, as will be explained in the following. In a typical procedure, the composites are formed by arranging carbon 
fibers in a two, three or four directional, occasionally unidirectional reinforcing 
structure, which is impregnated with a carbon-containing compound that functions 
as a precursor for the carbon
