<ABSTRACT>
An electrically conducting material is produced by a 
process which includes a step of treating a polyester substrate 

with an aqueous alkali solution to dissolve a portion of the 
polyester substrate into the solution. The resulting substrate 

is then reacted with a compound containing a group which can 
capture copper ion to introduce the
 copper ion capturing groups 
in the substrate. The copper ion-capturing group-containing 

substrate is thereafter treated with a source of copper ion and 
a sulfidizing agent to form copper sulfide bound to the 

polyester substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
preparation of an electrically conducting polyester
material.US-A-4378226 discloses a method of producing
electrically conducting polymeric fibers (such as
polyester fibers) which includes the steps of introducing
cyano groups into polymeric fibers by grafting
acrylonitrile thereonto, and treating the resulting
polymeric fibers with a source of cuprous ion and a
sulfur-containing compound to form copper sulfide bound
to the polymeric fibers. US-A-4690854 discloses an
electrically conducting polymeric material which includes
a polymeric substrate (such as polyester substrate)
containing mercapto, thiocarbonyl, quaternary ammonium
salt, amino or isocyanato groups, and copper sulfide
bound to the polymeric substrate.While the above electrically conducting
polyester materials have an excellent electrical
conductivity, they have a problem that the electrical
conductivity gradually decreases when subjected to
wearing conditions.The present invention has been made to solve
this problem.In accordance with the present invention there
is provided a process for the preparation of an
electrically conducting material, comprising the steps
of:
(a) treating a polyester substrate with an
aqueous alkali solution to dissolve from 0.3 to 30% by
weight of the polyester substrate in said solution and to
obtain a treated substrate, (b) reacting said treated substrate with a
compound containing a group for capturing copper ion, to
obtain a copper ion capturing group-containing substrate,
and(c) treating said copper ion capturing group-containing
substrate with a source of copper ion and a
sulfidizing agent to form copper sulfide bound to said
substrate through the copper ion capturing groups.The present invention will now be described in detail
below.The term "substrate" used in the present specification
is intended to refer to a shaped body such as fiber, thread,
woven or non-woven fabric, film, sheet, block, plate, pipe or
receptacle.The term "polyester substrate" is intended to mean a
substrate whose major component is a polyester. Thus, not only
a substrate composed substantially only of a polyester but also
a substrate formed of a mixture or a copolymer containing at
least 50 % by weight of a polyester may be used for the purpose
of the present invention.Any aromatic and aliphatic
polyester may be used in the present invention. Polyesters
obtained from a dicarboxylic acid, such as terephthalic acid,
naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, an aliphatic, long chain
dicarboxylic acid or a
