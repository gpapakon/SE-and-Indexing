<ABSTRACT>
A video subsystem for a computer system comprising a video adapter 
and a video monitor electrically communicating over a display cable 

having at least one monitor identification line . The three system 
components are designed such that after the video adapter reads the 

monitor identification from the monitor identification lines, the adapter 
and monitor reuse the monitor identification lines as a bidirectional 

serial link, over which large amounts and types of data may be 
transferred.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a computer system 
architecture and, more specifically, to a video subsystem having a video 
display adaptor, a monitor cable, and a video display monitor designed so 
that the monitor identification pins may be reused to provide a 
bidirectional serial link between the adaptor and the monitor. Personal computer systems are well known in the art. Personal 
computer systems in general, and IBM Personal Computers in particular, 
have attained widespread use for providing computer power to many 
segments of today's modern society. Personal computers can typically be 
defined as a desktop, floor standing, or portable microcomputer that is 
comprised of a system unit having a single central processing unit (CPU) 
and associated volatile and non-volatile memory, including all RAM and 
BIOS ROM, a system monitor, a keyboard, one or more flexible diskette 
drives, a fixed disk storage, and an optional printer. One of the 
distinguishing characteristics of these systems is the use of a 
motherboard or system planar to electrically connect these components 
together. These systems are designed primarily to give independent 
computing power to a single user and are inexpensively priced for 
purchase by individuals or small businesses. Examples of such personal 
computer systems are IBM's PERSONAL COMPUTER AT and IBM's PERSONAL 
SYSTEM/2. Personal computer systems are typically used to run software to 
perform such diverse activities as word processing, manipulation of data 
via spread-sheets, collection and relation of data in databases, displays 
of graphics, design of electrical or mechanical systems using 
system-design software, etc. Personal computer systems typically have a video subsystem 
comprising a video display adapter, a video display monitor, and a 
monitor cable. The video display adapter, also known as a "microcomputer 
display adapter" and herein as an "adapter" or a "video adapter," 
generates the electrical signals corresponding to the visual image 
displayed by the video display monitor, also known as a "visual display 
unit" and herein as a "monitor" or "video monitor." The adapter may be  
 
either an integral part of the system planar or may be an adapter card 
electrically connected to the system planar via an expansion slot. The monitor cable connecting the monitor to the adapter typically 
has 15 pins. The 15 pins at the connector mating with the video adapter 
typically include: red, green, and blue analog video pins, each having 
an associated

A video subsystem for a computer system, comprising: 
   a video adapter; 

   a video monitor; 
   and a monitor cable electrically connecting the adapter to the 

monitor, said cable having at least one monitor identification signal 
path for delivery of identification signals from the monitor to the 

adapter, wherein the monitor and the adapter have means for generating a 
communications link for dynamic communications between them along said 

identification signal paths. 
A video subsystem according to claim 1, wherein said means for 
generating a communications link between said monitor and said adapter is 

adapted to generate a bi-directional, serial communications link. 
A video subsystem according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
monitor has means for generating a predetermined, fixed identification 

signal and has means for supplying said fixed signal to said 
identification signal path for delivery to the adapter; the monitor being 

adapted to generate said fixed signal in the absence of a predetermined 
triggering event and to be responsive to said triggering event to cease 

generating said fixed signal and, together with said adapter, to generate 
said communications link. 
A video subsystem according to claim 3, wherein the adapter has 
means to generate said triggering event. 
A video subsystem according to claim 3 , having a timer 
connected to be activated by a preselected event, wherein said triggering 

event is the expiration of a predetermined period of time as measured by 
said timer. 
A video subsystem according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the monitor has means for generating said monitor identification 

signal. 
A method of electrically communicating between a video adapter 
device and a video monitor device, wherein said video monitor device is 

electrically connected to said video adapter device by connection means, 
 

said connection means having at least one monitor identification path, 
comprising the steps of: 

   generating at said video monitor a fixed monitor identification 
signal to be received by said video adapter; 

   responsive to a triggering event, ceasing the monitor's generation 

of said fixed monitor identification signal; and 
   generating a dynamic communications link between said video monitor 

and said video adapter for dynamic communications along said monitor 
identification path. 
A method according to claim 7 wherein said triggering event 
comprises a signal from said video adapter; and 

   said communications link is configured as a bidirectional serial 
link to allow bidirectional communication between said video adapter and 

said video monitor. 
A video adapter for use in a video subsystem having a video 
adapter, a video monitor, and a display cable electrically connecting 

said video adapter to said video monitor which cable has at least one 
monitor identification signal path for delivery of identification signals 

from the monitor to the adapter, said video adapter having means for 
generating a communications link for dynamic communications between said 

video adapter and said video monitor along said identification signal 
paths. 
A video monitor for use in a video subsystem having a video 
adapter, a video monitor, and a display cable electrically connecting 

said video adapter to said video monitor which cable has at least one 
monitor identification signal path for delivery of indentification signals 

from the monitor to the adapter, said video monitor having means for 
generating a communications link for dynamic communications between said 

video adapter and said video monitor along said identification signal 
paths. 
A video monitor according to claim 10 having: 
   means for generating a predetermined, fixed monitor identification 

signal and means for supplying said fixed signal to said monitor 
identification signal path for delivery to said adapter; 

   means for receiving a triggering event signal;
