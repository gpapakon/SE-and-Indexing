<ABSTRACT>
A method for correcting an instrumental error due 
to wavelength error of a spectroscope of an optical 

analyzer for measuring an optical density reflected from 
or transmitted through a dry analysis element. One 

standard color plate having a standard optical density 
OD
ST
 is measured by an optical analyzer to be corrected to 
obtain an measured value OD
M
. A measured optical density 
OD
S
 of the element applied with a sample through the 
optical analyzer to be corrected is corrected by using a 

ratio of OD
M
/OD
ST
 to obtain a corrected measured value OD
C
 
of the sample. The standard color plate to be used 

contains an indicator dye contained in the non-reacted 
dry analysis element or a 
dye having an absorption 
spectrum same as or similar to that of the indicator dye 

in the measurement wavelength range. Another correction 
method in consideration of a layer coefficient of a dry 

analysis element is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
correcting an instrumental error, mainly due to a
wavelength error of a spectroscope or spectrometer which
is provided with or built in an optical analyzer for
measuring a content, a concentration or an activity of an
analyte by measuring an optical transmitting or reflection
density of a dry analysis element.The dry analysis element is an analysis element
which comprises one or plural functional layers and an
analytical reagent composition is contained in at least
one (or plural) of these functional layers so as to form a
coloring dye by the reaction taking place in the layer.
The thus formed dye is colorimetrically analyzed by
measuring the transmitting or reflection light from the
outside of the analysis element. Since such a dry
analysis element is stored and preserved in the dry state
prior to the analysis operation, there is no need for
preparing the reagent at the measuring step. 
Furthermore, since the reagent has a higher stability in
the dry condition, the process using such a dry analysis
element is improved in simplicity and quickness of
operation over the conventional wet process in which the
reagent solution should be prepared as required. The dry
process or method using the dry analysis elements has
become rapidly a popular analytical method which can
easily realize an automated analyzing system in the field
of clinical examinations where a number of test samples
are to be handled as routine works.For a quantitative analysis, a liquid solution
containing the analyte is spotted or applied onto the dry
analysis element and an optical density of a transmitting
light through or a reflected light from the analysis
element after the completion of the coloring reaction is
measured by optical density measuring instruments such as
a colorimeter and a spectrophotometer. In such a method,
generally, it is common practice to determine the content
of the analyte by using a standard curve (commonly referred
to as "calibration curve") which has been preliminary
drawn by plotting the interrelation between the known
contents of the analyte in the standard samples and the
optical transmitting or reflection densities of the
analysis elements to which standard samples are applied.However, there is a problem such that an
instrumental error is caused due to variation or 
deviation of the optical density measuring apparatus as
used. That is, even when analysis elements of the same
manufacturing lot are used, measured values obtained by
different optical analyzer may
