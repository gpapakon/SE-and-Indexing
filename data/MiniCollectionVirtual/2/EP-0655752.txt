<ABSTRACT>
Described is a ceramic composition comprising a compound 
having a perovskite structure represented by the formula 


AMO₃
 
where A is at least one element selected from the group 

consisting of 2A, 3A and 3B subgroup elements of the 
international periodic table of IUPAC, where M is at least 

one element selected from the group consisting of 4A, 5A, 6A, 
7A and 8 subgroup elements of the international periodic 

table of IUPAC, and wherein said perovskite compound is made 
up of p-type and n-type components and the elements are 

present essentially within solubility limits in the 
perovskite structure. This ceramic composition is especially 

useful as a main component for a thermistor element (1) 
exhibiting stable properties at elevated temperatures up to 

1100°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic composition which is
especially useful as a component of a thermistor.A ceramic composition according to the preamble of claim 1 is
known from US-A- 3 441 517. Among the materials for thermistor usable at elevated
temperatures, there have hitherto been employed (a) a
material based on a corundum type crystal structure, mainly
composed of Al2O3 and Cr2O3, as disclosed for example in JP
Patent Kokai Publication JP-A 50-118294, (b) a material
based on a spinel type crystal structure, mainly composed of
MgAl2O4, MgCr2O4 and MgFe2O4, as disclosed for example in JP
Patent Kokai Publication JP-A 49-63995, (c) a material
mainly composed of ZrO2, stabilized mainly with Y2O3 etc.,
as disclosed for example in "Nainen Kikan" (Internal
Combustion Engine), vol. 30, No. 8, page 98, and (d) a
material mainly composed of a compound having a perovskite
type crystal structure, exhibiting a high melting point and
electrical conductivity, such as a material having a La(Al1-xCrx)O3
based composition, as disclosed in, for example, JP
Patent Kokai Publication JP-A 51-108298, a material having a
thin film of LaCrO3 on an insulating substrate, as disclosed
for example in JP Patent Kokai Publication JP-A 61-161701,
or a material comprising a mixture of LaCrO3 and MgAl2O4, as
disclosed for example in JP Patent Kokai Publications JP-A
51-95297 and JP-A 51-23691.Based on eager investigation by the applicant the
following has turned out. The corundum type crystal structure based
material (a), which may exhibit variable resistance-temperature
characteristics by addition of some other
element(s), suffers from deterioration in thermal stability
etc. on addition of a larger quantity of an additive(s).The material consisting mainly of the spinel type
crystal structure compound (b) has a larger temperature
gradient constant (β) so that it cannot be used over a wide
temperature range. The NiAl2O4 based material (JP Patent
Kokai Publication JP-A 49-29493) and CoAl2O4 based material
(JP Patent Kokai Publication JP-A 48-705 and so forth) are
low in thermal resistance and cannot be used at elevated
temperatures.The zirconia-based material (c) is unstable in its
resistance value under a reducing atmosphere and cannot be
put to practical use. On the other hand, the perovskite
type crystal structure compound based material (d) suffers
from a drawback that, if oxides of La are left in a non-reacted
state, non-reacted components tend to be reacted
with water contained in atmospheric air to yield labile
La(OH
