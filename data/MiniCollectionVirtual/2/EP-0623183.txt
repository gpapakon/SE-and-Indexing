<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fitting section (1) to take and hold various securing and/or moving components (2) of an awning. Fitting components (1) of the invention for awnings have one or two grooves (3), each with a tenon block (5) with two or one threaded holes (6) for screws (7) for securing the sections (1) to bearer arms (8). At the same time or alternatively these grooves (3) have projections (4) with attachments (9) acting together with recesses (10) in the tenon blocks (5). The sections (1) of the invention are small, rotationally and torsionally rigid, can be universally used and reinforced to any degree.

Awning having at least one support arm (8) on
which a mounting element (1) is fastened for receiving

and holding various fastening and/or movement elements
(2), having groove- and/or tube-like recesses (3) for

receiving the fastening and/or movement elements (2),
one of which recesses (3) is provided with projections

(4) flange-like in section and receives a sliding block
(5) with a threaded hole (6) for receiving a bolt (7)

which serves for fastening the mounting element (1) on
the support arm (8), characterized in that the mounting

element is in the form of a profile mounting element
(1) approximately polygonal in section, recesses (3)

being formed in at least two sides of the polygon, and
the recess or recesses on one side of the polygon being

formed for the passage of two adjacent fastening bolts
(7), at least two adjacent threaded holes (6) being

provided in the sliding block (5), or at least two
recesses (3) having at least one sliding block (5) each

for at least one bolt (7) each being provided side by
side, and that, in the operating state, the tensile

force-transmitting connection between profile mounting
element (1) and support arm (8) is provided exclusively

by the bolts (7), and that recesses (3) are arranged on
at least one side of the polygon, on which recesses the

flange-like projections (4) have inward-projecting
steps (9) for engaging - preferably diametrically

opposite - recesses (10) in the respective sliding
block (5).
Awning according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the polygonal cross-sectional shape has different

side lengths, and that - in the mounted state, the base
(11) of the polygonal cross-sectional shape preferably

faces a cloth shaft (12) of the awning. 
Awning according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the base of the polygonal cross-sectional shape

which is adjacent to the cloth shaft is concave and
thus moulds to the circumference of the cloth shaft.
Awning according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the profile mounting element (1)

is tubular at least in its interior.
Awning according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that at least one recess (3) is in the

form of a hinge and/or snap closure and optionally
serves for receiving cover elements (13), facing

elements (14) or stiffening elements (15).
Awning according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the profile mounting element has

at least one longitudinal hole (3t) which, in
operation, receives at least one cy
lindrical movement
element (2e) which acts as a hinge, the hinge

preferably serving to support a toggle lever joint
(16). (Fig. 6)
Awning according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the profile mounting element

consists of a preferably extruded, corrosion-resistant
alloy - for example of aluminium - or was produced from

sheet metal by the rolling technique and/or is anodized
and/or is provided with a weather-resistant coating.
Awning according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that all recesses (3) which are open

or not used are covered by means of - preferably
insertable or snap-on - aluminium lamellae, in

particular narrow grooves being provided for this
purpose in the region of the projections (4).
Awning according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that at least one of the recesses (3),

optionally a cylindrical hole, is formed for receiving
a thread or a bolt in the longitudinal direction of the

element (1).
