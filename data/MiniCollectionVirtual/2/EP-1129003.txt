<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in electric power assisted steering
systems, and in particular to improvements in the arrangement of electrical
circuitry in such systems.Electric power assisted steering systems are well known in the art. A
typical system comprises a first portion of shaft operatively connected to a
steering wheel and a second portion of shaft operatively connected to a road
wheel of the vehicle through, for example, a steering rack. A torque sensor
provides an indication of the torque in the first portion of shaft, and
produces an output signal dependent on that torque which is passed to an
electrical circuit. The electrical circuit processes the output signal to
produce a motor drive signal for a motor which is connected through a
gearbox to the second portion of shaft. The motor drive signal corresponds
to an assistance torque to be applied by the motor to the second portion of
shaft to assist the driver of the vehicle, thus making the steering wheel
easier to turn.The electrical circuit comprises low power devices which modify the output
signal from the torque sensor to produce the motor drive signal. This may
typically comprise an electronic control unit comprising an integrated
circuit or discrete components. The motor drive signal is then further
processed by the circuit to produce one or more motor voltage current
signals indicate of the current required in each phase of the electric motor.
For a typical three phase motor, a pulse width modulation strategy can be
employed to drive the motor, whereby the motor drive signal is converted
into three motor phase voltage signals which control suitable high power
switching circuitry to apply the appropriate voltage waveform to each motor 
phase. A capacitor may also be provided which is placed in the motor
current path to enable a measurement of motor current to be made.The electronic and electrical circuitry can therefore be considered to be
loosely divided into two stages. A first (control) stage comprises the low
power components used to modify the torque sensor output signal and
generate the appropriate motor drive signal (s). The second stage (power
stage) comprises the high power electrical components and associated
electrical conductors of the electrical switching stage, typically a bridge
circuit of high power semiconductor switching devices, for example
transistors, and the motor current sense resistor.It is known in the art in electric power assisted steering systems of the
kind set forth to provide both the control
