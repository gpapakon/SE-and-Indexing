<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a packaging device for folding a shirt or similar garment and for securing it against falling out of the folded state, having a flat, essentially rectangular insert (1) on whose one narrow side (2) a collar support (3) is arranged, onto which, when the back part of the shirt is placed on the insert (1), the rear region of the shirt collar can be fitted, having holding means (5, 7) for fixing the shoulder parts of the side regions of the shirt relative to the insert (1), said side regions being folded symmetrically about both longitudinal sides (6) of the insert (1) until they rest on the back thereof, and having holding means (5) for securing the position of the edge region of the bottom part of the shirt which is folded, to complete the folding process, about the narrow side (8) of the insert (1) located opposite the collar support (3) until it rests on the back of said insert. The device has the further features that the holding means are formed solely from spring tongues (5, 7) which extend in the longitudinal direction of the insert (1) formed as a rigid moulding and are connected firmly to the insert at their ends pointing towards the collar support (3), specifically only there, and press the relevant shirt regions against the plane of the insert (1).
