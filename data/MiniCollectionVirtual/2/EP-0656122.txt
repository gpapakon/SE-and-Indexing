<ABSTRACT>
A method and test kit for providing contraceptive advice during the human ovulation cycle, involving simply the measurement of urinary lutenising hormone (LH) concentration on a daily basis during the early phase of the cycle until the LH surge indicative of ovulation is detected, together with calender means to advise the user to abstain from unprotected intercourse during a time interval commencing not later than a predetermined first day of LH testing and ending at least 2 days following the day of LH surge detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and test kits 
enabling contraceptive advice to be provided during the 
human ovulation cycle. Devices are already commercially available which purport to 
provide the user with contraceptive advice. Generally 
these are based on the measurement of basal body 
temperature, and require the user to make daily 
measurements. The reliability of the contraceptive advice 
provided by such devices is questionable. Devices are also available which measure the concentration 
of urinary lutenising hormone (LH), and alert the user to 
the LH surge indicative of ovulation, as an aid to 
conception. Cekan et al, Contraception, Vol 33 No. 4 (1991) p327-45 
compares a range of urinary analytes of possible use in the 
prediction of ovulation or fertile period, in experiments 
involving the collection of daily urine samples during a 
complete cycle. Cekan et al conclude that although for the 
prediction of ovulation or fertile period, the best index 
of urinary steroids appears to be the sustained rise in the 
ratio of E1G to C, this "best" method is still not good 
enough in terms of overall reliability and practicability. Bischof et al, Human Reproduction, Vol.6 No.4 (1991) p 515-18 
is an academic study to evaluate a rapid automated assay 
for LH. No testing regime for the purposes of 
contraception is proposed. WO-A-91/15594 discloses an assay for total gonadotropal 
alpha chain. Again, no testing regime for the purposes of 
contraception is proposed.  
 EP-A-367615 discloses a birth control method relying 
principally on the testing of urinary progesterone 
metabolites to define the late safe period of the ovulation 
cycle. Although the absolute urinary concentration value of LH 
varies from one individual to another, and from one cycle 
to another, the LH surge is such a pronounced event that 
for practical purposes a urinary LH concentration of 
2-OmIU/ml can be regarded as a universal threshold 
indicative of the LH surge under virtually all 
circumstances. Although the LH surge is a clearly measurable event, it has 
not hitherto been regarded as an acceptable indicator for 
contraceptive purposes because it occurs such a short while 
prior to actual ovulation. Practical contraceptive advice, 
which would allow a user to avoid conception by abstaining 
from unprotected intercourse (ie. without resort to any 
physical or hormonal contraceptive technique) for a minimal 
portion of the normal ovulation cycle, has not been 
considered possible if based solely on the measurement of 
u

<CLAIMS>
A method of reducing the likelihood of conception in 
an individual human, simply requiring the measurement of 

urinary lutinising hormone (LH) concentration during a 
succession of ovulation cycles in the individual human, 

wherein frequent, preferably daily, testing of urinary LH 
concentration is performed until the LH surge associated 

with ovulation is detected, and unprotected intercourse is 
avoided during a time interval commencing on or before the 

first day of urinary LH concentration testing and ending at 
least 2 days following the day of LH surge detection, said 

testing commencing on a numerical day in the current cycle 
that is at least 4 but not more than 8 days in advance of 

the numerical day corresponding to the day of detected LH 
surge in the previous cycle, and said 
testing commencement 
day being in the interval from numerical day 5 to numerical 

day 15 inclusive following the onset of menses. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein at least during 
an initial usage cycle commencement of testing, and 

avoidance of unprotected intercourse, are both begun not 
more than 7 numerical days following the onset of menses. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
unprotected intercourse is avoided during a time interval 

ending at least 3 days following the day of LH surge 
detection. 
A test kit for use in a method according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, comprising a plurality of disposable urinary 

LH concentration testing devices together with means 
enabling a user to record the results of urinary LH tests, 

characterised in that the recording means advises the user 
to commence testing in the current cycle on a numerical day 

that is at least 4 but not more than 8 days in advance of 
the numerical day corresponding to the day of detected LH  

 
surge in the previous cycle. 
A test kit according to claim 4, wherein each 
disposable urinary LH concentration testing device 

comprises a reagent-impregnated immunochromatographic assay 
strip incorporating an anti-LH antibody labelled with a 

particulate direct label, the assay strip having a urinary 
LH concentration sensitivity sufficient to provide to the 

user a test result indicative of the onset of the LH surge. 
A test kit according to claim 5, wherein the urinary 
LH concentration sensitivity is such that an indication is 

given to the user when the urinary LH concentration rises 
to a level in the range 20-30 mIU/ml. 
A test kit according to any one of claims 4 to 6, 
wherein the recording means comprises a chart on which the 

user can enter daily urinary LH concentration test results. 
A test kit according to claim 7, wherein the chart is 
provided with a cursor that the user can position adjacent 

a "day" on the chart on which the LH surge detection is 
entered, and the cursor advises the user of an optimum test 

starting day in the subsequent cycle. 
A test kit according to claim 8, wherein the chart comprises 
a cursor that can 

highlight a group of consecutive "days" on the chart and 
which cursor, by alignment with a "day" on which the LH 

surge detection is recorded, can indicate to the user 
the residual unsafe period during the current cycle. 
A test kit according to claim 9, wherein the 
cursor can indicate to the user a numerical day in the 

subsequent cycle on which urinary LH testing should be  
 

commenced, said numerical day being during the interval of 
at least 4 but not more than 8 days inclusive in advance of 

the numerical day in the subsequent cycle corresponding to 
the numerical day of LH surge detection in the current 

cycle.
