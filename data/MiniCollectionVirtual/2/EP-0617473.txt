<ABSTRACT>
An oxide is formed which will form an oxide superconductor 
containing a Cu-O atomic layer. The oxide is hydrogenated. The 

oxide is oxidized after it is hydrogenated. The hydrogenation and 
the oxidization are executed simultaneously with or after the oxide 

is formed. The hydrogenation and the oxidization improve the 
superconducting characteristics of the oxide superconductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
fabricating an oxide superconductor
including a Cu-O atomic layer.Some oxide superconductors made of crystals including Cu-O
atomic layers have transition temperatures Tc higher than the
temperature of liquid nitrogen although the details of
superconducting mechanisms thereof are unknown. Examples of
such high-Tc oxide superconductors are Y-Ba-Cu-O
superconductors, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductors, Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O
superconductors, and Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O superconductors. The
application of high-Tc oxide superconductors to the field of
electronics is expected, and making them into a thin-film
configuration and a wire configuration (a line configuration) has
been vigorously investigated.Regarding a fired block (a sintered block), a thin film, and a
wire of high-Tc oxide superconductors, it is possible to improve
their superconducting characteristics such as their transition
temperatures Tc by optimizing processes of making them. In
addition, critical current densities in high-Tc oxide 
superconductors can be improved to a certain extent by optimizing
conditions of making them and control of their crystallinities.When magnetic flux caused by a current driven through a
superconducting body is fixed, the superconducting current can
efficiently flow therethrough. To fix the magnetic flux, it is
preferable to introduce pinning centers in the superconducting
body.In general oxide superconductors, pinning centers are
supposed to be non-superconducting portions such as crystal
defects, grain boundaries, and impurities. Pinning mechanisms in
high-Tc oxide superconductors are hardly elucidated.To attain the pinning effect, some methods of fabricating a
fired block (a sintered block) or a wire of a high-Tc oxide
superconductor have a process of adding impurity or a process of
controlling firing conditions (sintering conditions) and thereby
depositing impurity. In the case of a thin film of a high-Tc oxide
superconductor, it is known that high-energy particles such as
various ions accelerated by a voltage (a potential) of at least several
tens of KV or high-speed neutrons are applied to the thin film to
cause defects in the crystal of the superconductor or to inject
impurities into the crystal of the superconductor. In addition, it is
known to apply an energy beam such as an x-ray beam, an electron
beam, or an ultraviolet beam to a thin film.Regarding the effects of the application of such energy beams
on a critical current density, detailed investigations have not yet
been completed. In
