<ABSTRACT>
Modular user systems for logical connection control can generate several independent connection requests to a resource control system in charge of the physical connection control. In order to avoid connection control coordination problems caused thereby, a coordination system controls the transmission of the connection requests to the resource control system.

Coordination system for coordinating connection 
requests of a modular connection system to a switching 

control system (PSS), the connection system being used 
for controlling connections at the logic level, and the 

switching control system (PSS) being used to control 
connections at the physical level, and the coordination 

system comprising coordination modules (LSM) which are 
designed in such a manner that they 


a) receive from the connection system and buffer-store 
connection requests produced for an active connection 

end point (VEP) involved with the connection, 
b) pass on a connection request, which is buffer-stored 
by them, to the switching control system (PSS) when 

they have received control over an active connection 
end point, 
c) surrender control over a specific active connection 
end point to one another in such a manner that only 

one coordination module ever has control over this 
active connection end point at a specific point in 

time. 
Coordination system according to Claim 1, 
characterized by a control surrendering mechanism between 

the coordination modules (LSM), which is designed in such 
a manner that 


a) a coordination module (LSM) having a lower priority 
must wait until control has been passed to it by a 

coordination module of higher priority, while 
b) a coordination module having higher priority can 
request control from a coordination module of lower  

 
priority. 
Coordination system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by 


a) coordination modules (LSM) of a first type which are 
designed in such a manner that they can achieve 

control over in each case one active connection end 
point of a connection, 
b) coordination modules of a second type which are 
designed in such a manner that they can achieve 

control over in each case two active connection end 
points of a connection, there being in each case 

only one coordination module of the second type per. 
connection end point pair in the coordination module 

chain of a connection, 
c) priority control in accordance with which a coordination 
module has higher priority with respect to 

the control of a connection end point the closer it 
is to the end point of the coordination module 

chain. 
Coordination system according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that a coordination module (LSM) is 

designed in such a manner that it can pass on a 
connection request for a connection end point over which, 

in principle, it cannot achieve control, to another 
coordination module which can achieve control over this 

connection end point. 
Coordination system according to one of Claims 1 
to 4,
 
characterized in that 


a) one and only one coordination module (LSM) is 
permanently assigned to each module of the 

connection system, 
b) the communication of the coordination modules takes 
place via the communications channels of the modules 

of the connection system. 
Coordination system according to one of Claims 1 
to 5,
 
characterized in that
  
 

a coordination module (LSM) is designed in such a manner 
that the transfer of a connection request to a coordination 

module conforms with a procedure call. 
Coordination system according to one of Claims 1 
to 6,
 
characterized in that the coordination modules (LSM) are 

designed in such a manner that they translate the 
connection requests passed to them in each case into a 

connection command which is comprehensible for the 
switching control system (PSS).
