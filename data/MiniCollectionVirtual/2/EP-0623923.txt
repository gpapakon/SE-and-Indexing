<ABSTRACT>
An optical recording medium which has physical and 
chemical stability, has high sensitivity to laser light and 

permits accurate recording and highly reliable reproduction 
comprises a transparent substrate and a recording layer 

formed on the substrate, the recording layer being formed 
of an organic thin layer containing at least one 

phthalocyanine compound of a specified formula [1].

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
recording medium on which data is written and read by means 
of laser light. A variety of media are conventionally available 
for recording data with laser light, and among them is a 
medium whose recording layer is irradiated with laser light 
for locally heating the recording layer and causing a 
physical or chemical change such as melting, evaporation, 
sublimation or decomposition on an irradiated portion, i.e., 
for forming pits to record data. The thin layer as the recording layer of the above 
optical recording medium is generally formed from any one of 
metals such as As, Te, Se and Ti or an alloy of at least two 
of them. However, the optical recording medium using 
the thin layer of any one of the above metals or the above 
alloy as a recording layer has the following defect. Since 
the recording layer has high thermal conductivity, long and 
narrow pits expand too wide in the width direction when 
formed for recording, and a pit-length modulation method for 
high-density recording cannot be applied. On the other hand, for example, U.S. Patent 
4,622,179, 4,725,525, 4,492,750 or 4,458,004 discloses an 
optical recording medium whose recording layer is formed of 
an organic dyestuff having low thermal conductivity for 
applying the pit-length modulation method. However, the  
 
recording media disclosed in the above U.S. Patents are not 
yet satisfactory since the proposed organic dyestuffs still 
fail to give a recording layer having excellent physical and 
chemical stability. Further, JP-A-2-42652 or JP-A-2-147,286 discloses 
an optical disc obtained by consecutively laminating a 
transparent substrate, a recording layer formed of an 
organic dyestuff, a reflection film and a protection film as 
an optical recording medium compatible with CD or CD-ROM on 
which data can be recorded by an eight-to-fourteen 
modulation (EFM) method based on pit-length modulation. Cyanine compounds have been being studied as the 
organic dyestuff for forming the recording layer of the 
above optical disc, and some of them have been put to 
practical use. In general, however, the cyanine compounds 
have poor light resistance and may cause a problem on 
recording reliability, and optical recording media using 
recording layer formed of cyanine compounds do not always 
have the device life equivalent to that of usual CD or CD-ROM. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an optical recording medium whose recording layer is 
formed of a specific phthalocyanine
