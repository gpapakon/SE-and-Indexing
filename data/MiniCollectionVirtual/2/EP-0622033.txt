<ABSTRACT>
A depilating device has a housing (10) with a top opening (23) 
and a plucking head (40) with a longitudinal axis. The plucking 

head (40) carries a series of pinching elements (43,44) arranged in 

side-by-side 
relations to form therebetween gaps. At least one (44) 

of the adjacent pinching elements is movable relative to the 
other (43) in a direction of successively opening and closing 

said gaps so as to entrap and pinch the hairs between the 
adjacent pinching elements for plucking the hairs from the 

skin. The plucking head (40) is disposed to expose the pinching 
elements (43,44) in the top opening. A skin guide (30) is disposed 

around the plucking head (40) within the opening (23) to be exposed at 
least partially beyond the pinching elements (43,44) for sliding 

contact with the skin. The device is characterized in that 
the plucking head (40) and the skin guide (30) are floatingly 

supported to the housing (10) by means of a common structure such 
that they are capable of being depressed together into the 

housing (10) within a predetermined extent. Because of the 
common supporting structure, the plucking head (40) and the skin 

guide (30) can be depressed to the same extent, i.e, pressed 
evenly against the skin. Whereby, the skin guide (30) can well 

prevent the plucking head (40) from being over-pressed against 
the skin, which avoids the otherwise lowering of the 

plucking speed, thus assuring effective plucking operation 
without irritating the skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a depilating
device for removing superfluous hairs from the skin for
aesthetic reasons or the like.Depilating devices are known, for example, in European
Patent Publication EP 0 500 075 A2, which has a plucking
head having a plurality of pinching elements arranged along
an longitudinal axis of the head. At least one of the
adjacent pinching elements is driven to move towards and
away from the other pinching elements so as to repeat
pinching the hairs therebetween and releasing the hairs for
plucking the hairs from the skin of a user. The prior
depilating device discloses the use of a skin guide disposed
in an adjacent relation to a plucking head. The skin guide
is in use pressed against the skin of a user in order to
pluck the hairs by the plucking head while pressing the
skin, whereby reducing pain in plucking the hairs. In
addition, the skin guide acts to stretch the skin prior to
plucking the hairs while guided in contact with the skin in
an attempt to further reducing the pain. The skin guide is
resiliently supported to a depilator housing so that it is
pressed against the skin by a suitable pressing force. The
plucking head is also floatingly supported to the housing
for intimate contact with the skin by a suitable pressing 
force applied from the user. However, the skin guide and
the plucking head are separately supported to the housing by
different mechanisms so that they are depressed
independently from each other with different counterforces.
With this separate supporting structure, the plucking head
and the skin guide are likely to be pressed at different
forces depending upon the portions of the skin depending
upon a manner of pressing the plucking head against the skin
or a pressing force applied to the skin from the user, which
may cause the plucking head to be pressed by a greater force
than the skin guide. In this case, the plucking head
suffers from an overload condition where the movable
pinching element of the head lowers its operation speed or
the plucking rate, failing to pluck the hair quickly and
therefore irritating the skin.The present invention has been accomplished to
eliminate the above problem and provide an improved
depilating device which can effectively minimize pain in
plucking the hairs to assure a comfortable use. The
depilating device of the present invention comprises a
housing with a top opening and a plucking head.
The plucking head carries a series of
pinching elements arranged in side-by-side relations to form
therebetween

<CLAIMS>
A depilating device for removing hairs from the skin
of a user which comprises:


a housing (10) with a top opening (23);
a plucking head (40) carrying a series of pinching
elements (43,44) arranged in side-by-side relations to form

therebetween gaps, at least one of the adjacent pinching
elements (44) being movable relative to the other in a

direction of successively opening and closing said gaps so
as to entrap and pinch the hairs between said adjacent

pinching elements for plucking the hairs from the skin, said
plucking head disposed to expose said pinching elements in

said opening;
an electric motor (70) incorporated within said housing
and connected through a drive mechanism to drive said

plucking head for plucking the hairs;
a skin guide (30,34,35) disposed around said plucking
head within said opening to be exposed at least partially

beyond said pinching elements for contact with the skin;

characterized in that

said plucking head (40) and said skin guide (34,35) are
