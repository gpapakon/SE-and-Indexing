<ABSTRACT>
Aluminium-containing substrate for enamel coatings, comprising, at least on the areas intended for enamel coating, a surface layer of aluminium or an aluminium alloy and, on this surface layer, an oxide layer which constitutes an isotropic barrier layer with a thickness of from 0.01 to 1  mu m and a dielectric constant of between 5 and 10. Adjacent to this barrier layer there may also be a porous oxide layer with a thickness of from 0.1 to 10  mu m. An enamel coating having a thickness of, for example, from 50 to 200  mu m is applied to the substrate. The enamelled substrates can be employed as exterior panelling on vehicles or exterior facing on buildings, the enamel-coated substrates being outstandingly protected against external influences.

coatings containing a surface layer of aluminium or an

aluminium alloy at least on the surfaces provided for an
enamel coating, and a pore-free oxide layer which is an

isotropic barrier layer of a thickness of 0.01 to 0.5 µm
