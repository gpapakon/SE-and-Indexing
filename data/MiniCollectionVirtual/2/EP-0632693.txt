<ABSTRACT>
Novel bacterial isolates are provided for the biological control of post-harvest rot causative organisms, particularly by antagonism to fungal growth. Particularly the present invention provides novel isolates of bacteria of species Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia plymuthica, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilis and Bacillus polymyxa which are particularly effective in inhibiting the growth of organisms of the post-harvest disease causing fungi Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola. Further provided are antibiotics derived from the Bacillus species.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel bacterial isolates and to their
use as agents, or source of agents, antagonistic to growth of rot
causing organisms. Particularly the present invention provides novel
isolates of bacteria of species Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia
liquefaciens, Serratia plymuthica, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus pumilis
which are particularly effective in inhibiting
the growth of organisms of the post-harvest disease causing fungi
Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola. Purther provided are
antibiotics derived from the Bacillus species.Post-harvest losses during storage of plant produce are caused, inter
alia, by water loss, leaf senescence, regrowth and rotting, the latter
particularly caused by fungal and bacterial pathogens. Such post
-harvest losses can be greatly reduced by storage at low temperatures
(eg.1-20°C) and high relative humidity (eg.95%)(Robinson et al.
1975). Under these storage conditions B. cinerea is the prevalent
fungus found on stored cabbages and the main reason for losses (Geeson
1978, Brown et al. 1975); it being an opportunistic pathogen of a
wide range of leafy vegetables attacking weakened, wounded or
senescent leaf tissues and is also known to attack various fruit (see
patent US 5041384). Healthy leaf tissues have, however, been
described as being highly resistant to Botrytis attack (Newhook 1951).
Initial resistance of the exposed outer leaves is also likely to be
the reason for the finding that Botrytis rot of cabbages usually
starts after 2-3 months of cold storage and is often confined to the
outer, dried out, senescent cabbage leaves (Wale 1980).To prevent fungal spoilage it is common practice in many countries to
spray cabbages with systemic fungicides in the field and to dip
harvested cabbage heads in fungicide solutions prior to storage (Brown
et al. 1975). Since the oncogenic nature of many of the most
commonly used fungicides is increasingly recognized and because the
persistence of most fungicides is increased by the low storage
temperatures the postharvest use of fungicides is of growing concern. Additionally, resistance to the fungicides used has been reported
(Spotts & Cervantes 1986) and suppression of the main spoilage
organism B. cinerea by fungicides such as benomyl has been shown to
result in increased population of A. brassicicola which causes a more
penetrating rot of cabbage heads than B. cinerea (Wale & Epton 1979).Control of post-harvest fungal pathogens by bacteria and yeast
antagonists such as Bacillus subtilis,
