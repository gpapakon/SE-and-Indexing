<ABSTRACT>
Substituted phenylsulphonamides having the formula: 

where the variables are as defined in Claim 1;


 

are selective beta-3 adrenergic 
receptor agonists with very little beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic 

receptor activity 
and as such the compounds are capable of increasing lipolysis and 

energy expenditure in cells. The compounds thus have very potent 
activity in 

the treatment of Type II diabetes and obesity. The compounds can also 
be used to reduce triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels or raise 

high 
density lipoprotein levels or to reduce gut motility. In addition, the 

compounds can be used to reduce neurogenic inflammation or as 
antidepressant agents. The compounds are prepared by coupling an 

aminoalkylphenylsulphonamide with an appropriately substituted alkyl 
epoxide. Compositions and methods for the use of the compounds in the 

treatment of diabetes and obesity and for reduction of triglyceride 
levels 

and cholesterol levels or raising high density lipoprotein levels or for 
increasing gut motility are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
β-Adrenoceptors have been subclassified as β1 and β2 since 
1967. Increased heart rate is the primary consequence of β1-receptor 
stimulation, while bronchodilation and smooth muscle relaxation 
typically result from β2 stimulation. Adipocyte lipolysis was initially 
thought to be solely a β1-mediated process. However, more recent 
results indicate that the receptor-mediating lipolysis is atypical in 
nature. These atypical receptors, later called β3-adrenoceptors, are 
found on the cell surface of both white and brown adipocytes where 
their stimulation promotes both lipolysis (breakdown of fat) and energy 
expenditure. Early developments in this area produced compounds with 
greater agonist activity for the stimulation of lipolysis (β3 activity) than 
for stimulation of atrial rate (β1) and tracheal relaxtion (β2). These 
early developments disclosed in Ainsworth etal., U.S. Patents 4,478,849 
and 4,396,627, were derivatives of phenylethanolamines. Such selectivity for β3-adrenoceptors could make 
compounds of this type potentially useful as antiobesity agents. In 
addition, these compounds have been reported to show antihyperglycemic 
effects in animal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus. A major drawback in treatment of chronic diseases with β3 
agonists is the potential for stimulation of other β-receptors and 
subsequent side effects. The most likely of these include muscle tremor 
(β2) and increased heart rate (β1). Although these phenylethanolamine 
derivatives do possess some β3 selectively, side effects of this type have  
 
been observed in human volunteers. It is reasonable to expect that these 
side effects resulted from partial β1 and/or β2 agonism. More recent developments in this area are disclosed in 
Ainsworth etal., U.S. Patent 5,153,210, Caulkett etal., U.S. Patent 
4,999,377, Alig etal., U.S. Patent 5,017,619, Lecount etal., European 
Patent 427480 and Bloom etal., European Patent 455006. Even though these more recent developments purport to 
describe compounds with greater β3 selectively over the β1 and β2 
activities, this selectively was determined using rodents, in particular, 
rats as the test animal. Because even the most highly selective 
compounds, as determined by these assays, still show signs of side 
effects due to residual β1 and β2 agonist activity when the compounds 
are tested in humans, it has become apparent that the rodent is not a 
good model for predicting human β3 selectivity. Recently, assays have been developed which more 
accurately predict
