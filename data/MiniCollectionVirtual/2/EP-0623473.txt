<ABSTRACT>
Improved print resolution in an inkjet printer is 
achieved by moving the carriage of an inkjet cartridge in 

a carriage scan direction to provide a first resolution 
in that direction which is greater than a second 

resolution in a print media advance direction. This can 
be achieved by firing two smaller drops of ink onto each 

square pixel in a single pass of the cartridge so as to 
provide, for example, a 600 dpi resolution in the 

carriage scan axis with a 300 dpi resolution in the media 
advance direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inkjet printing, and more
specifically to techniques for improving print resolution in inkjet
printing.Print resolution in inkjet printing in the media advance axis
is primarily determined by the spacing of the ink orifices, and in
normal circumstances the print resolution in the carriage scan axis
is the same as in the media advance axis. For example, in the
PaintJet and PaintJet XL printers of Hewlett-Packard Company, the
print cartridges had a nozzle spacing of 1/180th of an inch thereby
creating a printing resolution of 180 dots-per-inch (dpi) in the
media advance axis, and the print resolution in the carriage scan
axis was also 180 dpi. This symmetry made mapping of textual and
graphical files for printing a relatively straightforward task. However, even though higher resolution inkjet printheads have been developing
having a nozzle spacing of 1/300th of an inch as well as 1/360th of an inch, the demand for
higher quality printing is still not satisfied, and the need exists for improving the overall
print resolution without having to decrease the nozzle spacing on the printhead.European patent application Nos. EP-A-0513989 and EP-A-0533486 disclose
inkjet printers which have different resolutions along the vertical and horizontal axes. The
vertical resolution is constant and the horizontal resolution may be varied by changing the
scan speed or changing the firing frequency.US-A-5146236 discloses an inkjet record apparatus for driving a drop-on-demand
inkjet head. The inkjet may be operated in either of two different operation modes. The
printer is capable of printing at two different resolutions, either 300 dpi or 600 dpi.It is an object of the present invention to develop techniques for improving overall
print resolution by increasing the print resolution in the carriage scan axis.Another object is to provide an improved thermal inkjet printhead that delivers ink
in smaller drop volumes and which operates at reduced firing energy levels.A further object is to provide addressable high resolution pixels which are capable
of being printed in a single pass of the print cartridge.Another object is to provide printing resolution in the carriage scan axis which is
higher than the printing resolution in the media advance axis, while at the same time
minimizing the amount of ink applied to the printing media.According to the present invention, there are provided a method and a printer as
defined in the claims. Thus, the invention contemplates an ink cartridge which fires

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling the print resolution of ink cartridges (22, 24, 26, 28)
mounted on a carriage (20) for applying ink to a printing medium (14) driven in a printing-medium-advance

direction, comprising the steps of:

moving the carriage (20) at a predetermined velocity along a carriage-scan axis;
firing ink droplets from the cartridges (22, 24, 26, 28) at a predetermined firing
frequency from ink nozzles having a certain spacing in the printing-medium-advance

direction;
said moving step including moving the carriage (20) across the printing medium to
apply the droplets on an addressable grid which has a first resolution in the carriage-scan

axis and a second resolution in the printing-medium-advance direction, said first resolution
being higher than said second resolution, and said first and second resolutions define

standard pixels each having: a width along the carriage-scan axis equal to twice the
reciprocal of the first resolution, and a height along the printing-medium-advance direction

equal to the reciprocal of the second resolution; and

   wherein said firing step includes firing droplets so that in each pass of the carriage
up to two droplets can be deposited at substantially each standard pixel where printing is

required without resolution conversion processing, to complete the inking in a single pass.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein there is greater droplet overlap in the
carriage-scan axis than in the printing-medium-advance direction.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said moving step applies droplets on an
addressable grid wherein said first resolution X dpi in the carriage-scan axis is double said

second resolution Y dpi in the printing-medium-advance direction.
The method of any of claims I to 3, wherein said moving step applies droplets on
sub-pixels on an addressable grid; and each sub-pixel has dimensions 1/X inch by 1/Y

inch, where X is the resolution in the carriage-scan axis and Y is the resolution in the
printing-medium-advance direction. 
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein said firing step includes firing
two different primary colour ink droplets onto immediately adjacent sub-pixels to form a

secondary colour.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein said moving step applies
droplets on an addressable grid without using a dot depletion algorithm.

printer (10) comprising:


an inkjet cartridge (22, 24, 26, 28) having firing resistors of a predetermined size;
energy means for providing signals to said firing resistors;
nozzle means in close proximity to said firing resistors; and
means for controlling the energy means to fire, in each pass of the cartridge over
the medium, up to two ink droplets, without resolution conversion, from the nozzle means

onto each standard pixel where printing is desired, each pixel measuring 1/Y inch by 1/Y
inch of an addressable grid having a first printing resolution X dpi in a carriage-scan

direction which is higher than a second printing resolution Y dpi in a printing-medium-advance
axis, to complete the inking in a single pass.
The printer (10) of claim 7, wherein said first printing resolution X in the carriage-scan
direction is twice said second printing resolution Y in the printing-medium-advance

axis.
The printer (10) of claim 8, wherein said first printing resolution is 600 dpi and said
second printing resolution is 300 dpi.
The printer (10) of any of claims 7 to 9, wherein said firing resistor is generally
rectangular and has sides, and the size of the resistor is less than 60 microns on each side.

The printer (10) of any of claims 7 to 12, which further includes first print-mode

droplets to each pixel in the addressable grid; and

   second print-mode means for driving the carriage (20) at twice the standard scan
speed without changing the firing frequency of said firing resistors to selectively apply ink
