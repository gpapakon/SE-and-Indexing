<ABSTRACT>
The transmission system and the modem according to the invention use trellis-coded modulation based on a constellation broken down into N subsets. For each symbol received in this constellation, a decision device makes it possible to determine the combination of the N points which are closest to the symbol received in each of the N subsets. To do that, the constellation is divided into areas each corresponding to a given combination, and the device includes a module (2) for searching for the area in which every received point lies. This module then controls the reading of a table (3) which supplies the combination of points corresponding to this region. Applications: trellis-coded digital modulation, modems.

A transmission system using trellis-coded modulations based on a
constellation split up into N sub-sets, and comprising a data source and a data receiver

which itself comprises a decision arrangement enabling to determine the closest point to
a received symbol in each sub-set of the constellation by assigning to the received

symbol a combination of N points, characterized in that, whilst the constellation is split
up into zones corresponding each to a given combination of N points, said decision

arrangement comprises a searching module (2) for searching the zone in which the
received symbol is situated, and a Table (4) which provides, when read, the combination

corresponding to this zone.
A transmission system as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
zone searching module (2) determines the searched zone by dichotomy with respect to

the boundaries of the various zones.
A transmission system as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the
boundaries of the various zones are straight lines.
A transmission system as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the decision arrangement comprises a preprocessing module (1)

which enables to restore by symmetry any received point in one of the four quadrants of
the plane, selected as a reference plane to perform the searching operation there and

called reference quadrant, and in that the numbers of the zones in each of the quadrants
are selected such that a mathematical operation called "addition of a constant" enables to

go from the number of the zone obtained in the reference quadrant to the numbers of the
zones which are symmetrical with that zone along the axes of the plane of the

constellation in the other quadrants.
A transmission system as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that the
preprocessing module (1) and the zone searching module (2) and the Table (3) are

formed by a microprocessor unit.
A modem using trellis-coded modulations based on a constellation split up
into N sub-sets, and comprising a decision arrangement which enables to determine the

point closest to a received symbol in each sub-set of the constellation, assigning to the
received symbol a combination of N points, characterized in that, whilst the constellation 

is split up into zones corresponding each to a given combination of N points, said
decision arrangement comprises a searching module (2) for searching the zone in which

the received symbol is situated, and a Table (4) which provides, when read, the
combination corresponding to this zone.
A modem as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that the zone searching
module (2) determines the searched zone by dichotomy with respect to the boundaries of

the various zones.
A modem as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that the boundaries of
the various zones are straight lines.
A modem as claimed in one of the Claims 6 to 8, characterized in that said
decision arrangement comprises a preprocessing module (1) which enables to restore by

symmetry any received point in one of the four quadrants of the plane, selected as a
reference plane to perform the searching operation there and called reference quadrant,

and in that the numbers of the zones in each of the quadrants are selected such that a
mathematical operation called "addition of a constant" enables to go from the number of

the zone obtained in the reference quadrant to the numbers of the zones which are
symmetrical with that zone along the axes of the plane of the constellation in the other

quadrants.
A modem as claimed in Claim 9, characterized in that the preprocessing
module (1) and zone searching module (2) and the Table (3) are formed by a

microprocessor unit.
