<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a connector housing 
feeding mechanism (9) capable of rotating a plurality of 

connector housings (c) around an axis (s) along the 
direction in which the connector housings (c) are juxtaposed 

and displacing a group of the connector housings (c) to a 
predetermined terminal inserting position and housing 

replacing position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a connector
housing feeding mechanism, and more particularly, to a
connector housing feeding mechanism which can be most
suitably used for the terminal inserting process for an
electric wire assembly constituting a wiring harness.The manufacturing processes of a wiring harness
constructed by assembling a plurality of coated electric
wires include the measuring process for measuring and
cutting an electric wire, the stripping process for
stripping an end of the electric wire, the terminal crimping
process for crimping a terminal on a conductor in the end of
the stripped electric wire, the terminal connecting process
for connecting the electric wire to a connector housing
through the terminal, and the like.The terminal connecting process has been conventionally
carried out using a connecting apparatus. Such a connecting
apparatus is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility
Model Unexamined Publication No. 63-123082.The connecting apparatus in the prior art comprises a
terminal inserting mechanism and a housing feeding
mechanism. The terminal inserting mechanism cramps an end
of an electric wire and a terminal crimped on the end. On
the other hand, the housing feeding mechanism carries a lot 
of connector housings and juxtaposes the connector housings
in a horizontal direction. The connecting apparatus
sequentially inserts the end of the electric wire and the
terminal which are cramped into the connector housings
carried by the housing feeding mechanism.The conventional housing feeding mechanism comprises a
housing carrying member for horizontally juxtaposing a
plurality of connector housings. The housing carrying
member is supported by a supporting member. This supporting
member displaces the connector housings carried by the
housing carrying member, together with the housing carrying
member, to a terminal inserting position. The conventional
supporting member is embodied by an index table which is
square in plan view. The housing carrying member is
mounted on each of side surfaces of the index table. In
this case, the direction in which the connector housings are
juxtaposed is a direction along each of the sides, that is,
the side surface of the index table. The index table is
intermittently rotated for each angle of 90Â° around a
vertical axis. In a first stop position, the connector
housing is carried by the housing carrying member. In the
subsequent second stop position, the connector housing
carried by the housing carrying member waits. In the
subsequent

A connector housing feeding mechanism for
manufacturing a wiring harness, comprising:


housing carrying means (90) for replaceably carrying a
plurality of connector housings (C) to juxtapose the

connector housings (C) along one horizontal direction
perpendicular to the direction of terminal insertion;
stationary means (92) which allows the housing carrying
means (90) to be rotated around an axis (S) along the one

horizontal direction, for supporting the juxtaposed
connector housings (C) so as to be displaceable to a

terminal inserting position (P) for inserting a terminal (T)
and a housing replacing position (D) for replacing the

connector housings (C); and
displacing means (93) for alternately displacing the
housing carrying means (90) supported on the stationary

means (92) to the terminal inserting position (P) and the
housing replacing position (D) at predetermined timings.
A connector housing feeding mechanism as claimed in
claim 1, wherein


the housing carrying means (90) has a pair of housing
carrying members (90, 90) one of which is synchronously

opposable to one of the positions (P, D) when the other
housing carrying means (90) faces the other position.
A connector housing feeding mechanism as claimed in 
claim 1 or claim 2, wherein


the terminal inserting position (P) and the housing
replacing position (D) are horizontally opposed to each

other being perpendicular to the centre of rotation.
A connector housing feeding mechanism according to
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, further comprising


control means (110) for controlling the displacing
means (93) on the basis of position information of the pair

of housing carrying members (90, 90).
A connector housing feeding mechanism as claimed in any of
claims 1 to 4, comprising a connecting apparatus (M) for

connecting the electric wire (W) with terminals (T) to the
connector housing (C), which comprises a terminal inserting

mechanism (8) for inserting terminals (T) fixed at both ends
of an electric wire (W) upon holding the terminals (T) on

the wire (W).
A connector housing feeding mechanism as claimed in
claim 5, wherein


the connecting apparatus (M) constitutes a part of a
wiring harness manufacturing apparatus for automatically

manufacturing a wiring harness.
