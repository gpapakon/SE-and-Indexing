<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing and mass-producing a seamless heat-resistant 
resinous tube with a uniform tube wall thickness and circumference, which 

includes the steps of coating the precursor solution (3) of a tube material 
to the surface of a core (1) at a thickness greater than the tube wall 

thickness; passing a metallic die (2) having a wider inside diameter than 
the diameter of the core along the outside of the core by utilizing the 

resistant force of the precursor solution without restricting the metallic 

die or the core, thus forming a tube (4) around the core; treating the tube 
around the core to give it strength as a tube; and separating the tube from 

the core.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a heat-resistant
resinous tube by using a heat-resistant resin such as
polyimide resin, polyamideimide resin, aromatic polyester resin,
polyethersulfone resin, polyesterimide resin, polyparabanic acid
resin, polyimidazopyrrolone resin, bismaleimidetriazine resin or
the like.Heat-resistant resins, which have excellent physical and
chemical properties, have been molded in many different shapes
and used in various fields. Particularly in the most advanced
high-tech fields such as aerospace technology, electronics and
the like, heat-resistant resins have been useful because of their
heat-resistant property, mechanical strength, dimensional
stability and chemical stability.However, heat-resistant resins require special treatments
such as a long heat treatment at high temperature to harden and
form the resins into an imide. Molding procedures applied to
general plastic materials are not applicable to heat-resistant
resins since the simple heat treatments of the molding procedures
for general plastic materials do not melt and harden the resins,
so that it has been difficult to process heat-resistant resins so
as to fully utilize the properties of the resins. In other 
words, it has been extremely difficult to provide a molding
technology for heat-resistant resins.Tubes made from plastic high polymer materials, rubber,
and the like have been developed as conventional seamless tubes
with thin tube wall thickness, and their uses are diverse.
Methods used for manufacturing these tubes include an injection
method, an inflation method, and the like, and it is extremely
difficult to manufacture seamless tubes having an even tube wall
thickness between several µm and dozens of µm with these
methods. The seamless tubes having thin tube walls, which are
manufactured by the inflation method, are further thinned, in
some cases, through methods of drawing the tubes in a
longitudinal direction or passing them between pressure rollers.
However, tubes manufactured by these methods still have uneven
tube wall thickness.An example of a conventional method of manufacturing a
tube from polyimide resin includes the following steps:
treating the surface of a tetrafluoroethylenehexafluoropropylene
copolymer film with a corona discharge;heating and laminating a polyimide film on the surface of
the copolymer film, thus manufacturing a tape having a two-layer
structure;wrapping a core with the tape at a uniform thickness;heating and melting the tape wrapped around the core; and 
extract
