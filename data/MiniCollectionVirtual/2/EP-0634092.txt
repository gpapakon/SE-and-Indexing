<ABSTRACT>
The mower comprises a windrower aggregate (6) 
provided with a knife aggregate (6) and a conditioning 

device (8), said windrower aggregate being movably 
suspended by means of rigid articular bars (13) and at 

least one spring (14) in a carrier frame (3,12). The 
knife aggregate (6) comprises several knife means (7) 

disposed along an axis. The windrover aggregate (5) is 
suspended pivotally around a second axis (17) which is 

substantially parallel with the first-mentioned axis. At 
least one second spring (15) which carrying the windrower 

aggregate (5) in relation said pivoting, is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mower comprising 
a windrower aggregate provided with a knife aggregate 
and a conditioning device, said windrower aggregate being 
movably suspended by means of rigid articular bars 
and at least one spring in a carrier frame, the knife 
aggregate comprising several knife means mounted along 
an axis. Such a mower is known from DK-A-267/90 which 
describes a towed windrower, in which the windrower 
aggregate is suspended by means of articular bars 
mounted in two planes above each other and a spring 
relieving the ground pressure of the windrower 
aggregate. The knife aggregate is hinged to the windrower 
aggregate at its rear edge and may thereby swing 
between two stops. Another mower of the art mentioned above and in the 
preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-4 724 661. The 
mower disclosed therein comprises a windrowing aggregate 
or header which by means of parallel upper and lower 
links and spring means is suspended in a carrier frame. 
The header is divided into a first and a second header 
section, whereby the second header section by means of 
parallel upper and lower links and spring means is 
suspended in the first header section. Thereby two 
different vertical motions are possible, namely the 
header as a whole in relation to the carrier frame and 
the second header section in relation to the first 
header section. The second header section is angularly 
ajustable in relation to the first header section by 
virtue of a slot mechanism in the upper link between the 
two header sections. During operation the slot mechanism 
will be locked. The cutting of modern mowers is so effective that 
the travelling speed is only impeded by the danger of a 
breakdown due to the encounter with a stone or the like.  
 
It is, therefore, of importance that the ability of the 
knife aggregate to lift itself over irregularities in 
the ground is the best possible. The object of the invention is therefore to improve 
the ability of the knife aggregate to lift itself over 
irregularities in the ground. This object is met by a mower of the type mentioned 
by way of introduction, which mower is characterised in 
that the windrower aggregate is suspended such that 
during operation it is able to pivot in relation to the 
carrier frame around a second axis which is 
substantially parallel with the first-mentioned axis, 
and in that at least one second spring influencing the 
pivoting of the windrower aggregate around said second 
axis is provided. In this way an additional

<CLAIMS>
A mower comprising a windrower aggregate (5) 
provided with a knife aggregate (6) and a conditioning 

device (8), said windrower aggregate being movably 
suspended by means of rigid articular bars (13) and at 

least one spring (14) in a carrier frame (3,12), the 
knife aggregate (6) comprising several knife means 

mounted along a first axis,
chararacterized
 in that the windrower 
aggregate (5) is suspended such that during operation it 

is able to pivot in relation to the carrier frame (3, 
12) around a second axis (17) which is substantially 

parallel with the first-mentioned axis, and in that at 
least one second spring (15) influencing the pivoting of 

the windrower aggregate (5) around said second axis (17) 
is provided.  

 
A mower according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the articular bars (13) are provided in 

substantially one single plane, and in that their connections 
(17) with the windrower aggregate (5) define 

the second axis. 
A mower according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that said at least one spring (14) acts 

between the articular bars (13) and the carrier frame 
(3,3'). 
A mower according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that said at least one spring (14) acts 

between the carrier frame (3) and the windrower aggregate 
(5) and that on the latter the straining point is 

substantially on the second axis (17). 
A mower according to claims 1-4, 
characterized
 
in that the second spring comprises a tension 

spring (15) acting between the upper part of the windrower 
aggregate (5) and the carrier frame (3) and in 

that it extends in a plane substantially parallel with 
the plane of the articular bars (13). 
A mower according to claims 1-5, 
characterized
 
in that power means such as hydraulic cylinders  

 
(24) are mounted between the carrier frame (3') and at 

least some of the articular bars (13) in order to lift 
the windrower aggregate (5) when activated. 
A mower according to claims 1-5, 
characterized
 
in that a power means, such a hydraulic cylinder 

(23), is provided between the carrier frame (3') and the 
windrower aggregate (5) to lift the latter when activated, 

and in that a line through the straining points 
of the power means (23) on the carrier frame (3') and 

the wind-rower aggregate (5), respectively, substantially 
intersects the second axis (17). 
A mower according to claim 6 or 7 and adapted to be 
connected with the front lift (19) of a tractor, 


characterized
 in that as additional equipment 
it comprises a tension member, such as a chain 

(20), for limiting the downwards movement of the front 
lift (19).
