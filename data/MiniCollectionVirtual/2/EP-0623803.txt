<ABSTRACT>
An optical displacement sensor comprises first and second optical fibres 
(10, 12) which transmit light to and receive light reflected from first and 

second fixed reflectors (24, 26). A third optical fibre (14) transmits light 
to and receives light reflected from a moving reflector (30) on the end of 

a core (20) which moves in response to the displacement to be 
measured. The intensities of the light reflected to the fibres (10, 12, 14) 

allows the displacement to be determined with immunity from variations 
such as in transmissivity and refractive index of a medium between the 

fibres (10, 12, 14) and the reflectors (24, 26, 30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical displacement sensor. Such a 
sensor may be used in environments where a media in an optical path of 
the displacement sensor may undergo changes in refractive index and/or 
optical transmissivity. US 4488813 discloses an optical displacement sensor having two optical 
probes disposed at different distances X1 and X2 from a movable target. 
The distance to the target is calculated in accordance with X1 =(X1-X2)E1/(E2-E1), 
where E1 and E2 are the intensities of the reflected light 
received at the first and second probes, respectively, and (X1-X2) is 
known from the sensor geometry. According to the present invention there is provided 
an optical displacement sensor, comprising first and second optical paths 
for transmitting light to and receiving light from first and second 
reference reflectors, respectively, and a third optical path for transmitting 
light to and receiving light from a moving reflector. Preferably the sensor further comprises detecting means for measuring 
the intensity of the reflected light in each of the optical paths. The 
detecting means may comprise a light sensitive element for each optical 
path. Preferably the sensor further comprises processing means for processing 
the intensities of the reflected light in order to provide a measurement of 
the position of the moving reflector.  Preferably the first reference reflector is fixed at a first position and the 
second reference reflector is fixed at a second position. Advantageously 
the moving reflector moves between third and fourth positions. The first 
and second optical paths provide two reference points on a displacement 
versus intensity characteristic for the moving reflector. The length of the 
third optical path may vary between the lengths of the first and second 
optical paths as the moving reflector moves between the third and fourth 
positions. The third position may be substantially coincident with the first position. 
The second position may be substantially half way between the third and 
fourth positions. Alternatively the moving reflector may move such that 
the path length of the third optical path varies between substantially the 
length of the first optical path and at least the length of the second 
optical path, for example, twice the length of the second optical path. A first end of a first light guide may provide light to and receive light 
from the first reference reflector. Advantageously the optical path from 
the first end of the first light guide to the
