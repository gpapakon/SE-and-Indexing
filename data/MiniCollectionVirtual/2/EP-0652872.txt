<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to magnesium salt of the (-)-enantiomer of omeprazole its
use in medicine, a process for its preparation and its use in the manufacture of
pharmaceutical preparations. The invention also relates to novel intermediates in the
preparation of the compound of the invention.The compound 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole,
having the generic name omeprazole, and therapeutically acceptable
alkaline salts thereof are described in EP 5129 and EP 124 495, respectively. Omeprazole
and its alkaline salts are effective gastric acid secretion inhibitors, and are useful as
antiulcer agents. The compounds, being sulfoxides, have an asymmetric center in the sulfur
atom, i.e. exist as two optical isomers (enantiomers). It is desirable to obtain compounds
with improved pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties which will give an improved
therapeutic profile such as a lower degree of interindividual variation. The present
invention provides such a compound, which is the magnesium salt of the (-)- enantiomer of
omeprazole.The separation of the enantiomers of omeprazole in analytical scale is described in e.g. J.
Chromatography, 532 (1990), 305-19 and in a preparative scale in DE 4035455. The latter
has been done by using a diastereomeric ether which is separated and thereafter hydrolysed
in an acidic solution. Under the acidic conditions needed for hydrolysis of the attached
group, omeprazole is quite sensitive and the acid has to be quickly neutralized with a base
to avoid degradation of the acid-sensitive compound. In the above mentioned application
this is done by adding the reaction mixture containing concentrated sulfuric acid to a
concentrated solution of NaOH. This is disadvantageous because there is a great risk of 
locally reaching pH values between 1-6, which would be devastating for the substance.
Moreover, instantaneous neutralisation will create heat which will be difficult to handle in
large scale production.The present invention in a further aspect provides a novel method for preparing the novel
compound of the invention in large scale. This novel method can also be used in large scale
to obtain single enantiomers of omeprazole in neutral form.There is no example known in the prior art of any isolated or characterized salt of optically
pure omeprazole, i.e. single enantiomers of omeprazole neither of any isolated or
characterized salt of any optically pure omeprazole analogue.The present invention refers to the magnesium salt of
