<ABSTRACT>
A sprinkler (1) has flow control means (10) for generating different flow behaviour patterns during the advance and return movement of its sprinkler head (2) so that on advance movement a far-reaching sharp jet, and on return movement a spraying jet which sprinkles the vicinity are discharged through one and the same nozzle outlet (11).

Sprinkler, particularly for watering vegetation, for delivering at least
one fluid jet over a free jet path defining an average jet width to a

sprinkling field, with at least one sprinkler head (2) having a body and
having between a fluid inlet (12) for receiving the fluid under a supply

pressure and a specific passage quantity per time unit and a fluid outlet
(11) located at the start of the free jet path, a fluid guide (13)

determining at least one flow direction and having fluid paths for the fluid
flow, as well as control means for modifying the average jet width in

different jet widths and comprising at least one control device (10), which
has a reversing functional member (34) modifying the fluid flow in at least

one action area and with drive means (3) for the backward and forward
transverse movement of the fluid jet, 
characterized in that
 the control
device (10) as a function of changes of the transverse movement of the fluid

jet switches between the different jet widths, 
in that
 the reversing
functional member (34) diverts the fluid flow to another fluid path upstream

of the fluid outlet (11).
Sprinkler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the at least one
control device (10) switches the fluid flow upstream of the fluid outlet (11)

automatically between at least two jet widths, that the control device (10)
switches backwards and forwards in permanent operation and essentially

without interruption of the fluid jet between at least two jet widths and
that the control device (10) by modifying the fluid flow discharged from the

same outlet (11) substantially independently of the fluid discharge
volume discharged per time unit from the fluid outlet (11) or substantially

independently of the supply pressure at the fluid inlet (12) switches between
different jet widths.
Sprinkler according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the control
device (10) is constructed for modifying the fluid flow behaviour, such as

for fluid disturbance or stabilization within the fluid guide (13), for
reversing the flow direction within the fluid guide (13) and/or for modifying

a flow roller, that in particular the control device (10) acts more
particularly in the vicinity of a chamber (17), which has a greater width

than the passing in and/or out fluid paths (15, 16 or 26) and that preferably
from the action area of the control device (10) a substantially linear end

channel (26) leads directly to the fluid outlet (11) or the inlet (29) of a
discharge nozzle (28).
Sprinkler according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 an end channel (26) leading to a fluid outlet (11) can have a flow 
against it at a fluid inlet (25) in different directions and in the case of a

fluid supply in the different inflow directions has different flow controls,
particularly for a calm longitudinal flow and/or for a turbulent flow and the

end channel (26) at least in the vicinity of the inlet (25) and in a cross-section
at right angles through the inlet (25) has a roughly oval cross-section

differing from the circular cross-section and that preferably at the
inlet (25) there is a transverse boundary (32) against one inflow direction

and a parallel boundary (27) against a further inflow direction.
Sprinkler according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 for switching to a shorter jet width in the fluid guide (13) is provided
at least one flow disturbing member (27), that in particular a flow

disturbance (27) forms a cross-sectional reduction compared with a connecting
channel portion (26) in the flow direction and that preferably a channel

inlet (25) in axial section under an acute angle to the axis of a channel
portion (26) is bounded on one side by a projection (27) located roughly in

its plane and which projects from the associated channel wall side at right
angles against the opposite side and/or is located on a longitudinal side of

the elongated inlet (25) at right angles to the inflow direction and/or that
the control means are constructed for the successive or following separate

watering in essentially the same watering zone with at least two jet shapes.
Sprinkler according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the control device (10) has a multiway valve (33) with several
differently oriented and/or differently distanced valve outlets (18, 19) from

the outlet (11), that the control device (10) has a reversible rotor (20) and
that preferably a fluid-driven rotor (20) can be driven in opposite

directions by means of separate drive nozzles (18, 19) and/or that the drive
means (3) are provided for the intermittent or reciprocating movement of the

sprinkler head (2).
Sprinkler according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the fluid guide (13) has at least two parallel-connected channel
portions (15, 16) and blocking means (33) for the alternating reduction of

the medium through-flow through at least one channel portion (15, 16) and for
increasing the medium through-flow through at least one further channel

portion (16, 15), that in particular a first channel portion (15) issues in a
direct nozzle (18) directed to the inlet (25) of a connecting channel (26)
