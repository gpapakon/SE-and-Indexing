<ABSTRACT>
A polyester cloth dyed so as to have an L* value in the range of 25-65, and characterized by its high bathochromic property. 
At least the superficial portion of the fiber of one or both of the warp threads and weft threads constituting this cloth consists 

of fiber having a light transmittance in which the difference ΔX(X⊥-X∥) between the transmittance X∥ of polarization at 
a maximum absorption wavelength in the direction parallel to the axis of the fiber and the transmittance X⊥ of polarization at 

the same wavelength in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the fiber does not exceed 10 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dyed polyester fabric 
having a good color depth, which is comparable to or 
superior to those of fabrics of natural fibers. By the term "good color depth" used herein, we mean 
that the fabric is dyed not only deeply but also with an 
enhanced brilliancy, i.e., deeply dyed without turbidity 
and light-brownish coloration. Recently, the characteristics of polyester fibers 
have been remarkably improved. Especially, feeling, touch 
and drape of polyester fabrics have been improved to a 
level comparable to that of natural fibers (for example, 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 61-36099). 
Nevertheless, appearance, particularly the color depth, 
of the dyed polyester fabrics is not attractive as compared 
with those of fabrics of natural fibers such as silk and 
wool. It is therefore usual that consumers' interest is 
not excited at the first sight, even though the feeling 
and other characteristics are improved. Proposals of improving the dyeability and other 
dyeing properties have heretofore been made, which include, 
for example, the copolymerization of a specific comonomer 
to effect relaxation of the fibrous structure (Japanese 
Examined Patent Publication No. 63-39686) and the formation 
of micropores in the surface portion of the fiber to effect 
diffused reflection (Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
No. 62-28229). However, dyed polyester fabrics made by 
these proposals are still not satisfactory in the color 
depth which term is used in a broad sense in the present 
specification, i.e., in the color depth with brilliancy,  
 
although they are dyed deeply. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a dyed polyester fabric exhibiting a good color depth which 
is comparable or superior to those of natural fiber fabrics, 
as well as a good feeling, touch and drape. In accordance with the present invention, there 
is provided a dyed polyester fabric composed of warps and 
wefts, which are dyed with a lightness index L* value of 
25 to 65; fibers at least in the surface layer portion 
of either or both of the weft and the warp exhibiting a 
light transmittance to an extent such that the difference 
(ΔX in %) between the light transmittance (X⊥ in %) of 
polarized light vibrating perpendicular to the fiber axis 
at a wavelength of the maximum absorption and the light 
transmittance (X∥ in %) of polarized light vibrating 
parallel to the fiber axis at the same wavelength is not 
larger than 10%. Figure 1 shows graphs of light transmittances of 
fibers in
