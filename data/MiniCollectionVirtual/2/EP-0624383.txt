<ABSTRACT>
A neural stimulator comprises two receiving and 
transmitting devices (15, 1), one located outside 

the body of a patient, the other implanted in the 
part of the body to be stimulated and associated 

with a first set of electrodes (8) through which 
signals generated by the implanted device (1) are 

passed into the surrounding tissue; also associated 
with the implanted device (1) are a second set of 

electrodes (13, 14) serving to monitor selected 
bioelectrical functions or activities of the body, 

and a group of components (10, 9, 2) capable of 
processing the signals sensed by the monitoring 

electrodes (13, 14), which therefore can be used as 
a feedback control in defining at least certain of 

the parameters of the stimulation signals emitted 
from the first electrodes (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a neural stimulator 
of the type such as can be implanted stably in the 
human body. Electrical stimulation is widely used in medicine 
for the treatment of many diseases; conventional 
devices, including neural or medullary stimulators 
used in particular for the treatment of algesis, of 
various vascular diseases, cases of angina pectoris 
and other similar conditions, consist in tissue 
stimulators implanted at least partly within the 
human body, in a location close to the tissues it 
is wished to solicit. The basic principle governing the operation of such 
stimulators is that of the artificial pacemaker, a 
system whereby impulses are passed into tissues of 
the human body, at timed intervals or in response 
to the value of a control signal, by an electronic 
generator which can be fitted with suitable means 
or devices of transducing the signal, for example 
electrodes or electrode catheters.  By way of example, US Patent 4 800 898 discloses a 
neural stimulator designed for implantation in a 
subcutaneous zone, connected with and operating by 
way of an electrode positioned at various levels of 
the epidural space afforded by the vertebral column 
of the patient. The prior art also embraces apparatus utilizing 
electrical stimulation for the treatment of various 
diseases, in which the stimulators comprise means 
by which to transmit electrical signals, located 
externally of the body in a suitable position, and 
means for receiving the transmitted signals located 
internally of the body in a position close to the 
tissues it is wished to solicit. Given the fact that the means for receiving the 
electrical signals are implanted surgically in the 
patient, often in particularly delicate areas, and 
the contingency of the patient having subsequently 
to undergo treatment with different stimuli at 
different stages of a cure, the need to remove and 
replace the receiving means is avoided by designing 
stimulators capable of changing the type of signal 
administered to a patient in response to commands, 
generated externally, corresponding to the changed 
therapeutical requirements of the patient.  By this expedient, it becomes possible to limit the 
number of surgical operations on the patient, with 
obvious benefits. One example of such an arrangement is described in 
US 4 459 989. This reference discloses a stimulator 
for various types of tissue, wherein the stimulus 
is induced by electrodes implanted in the patient 
and driven by receiving means, positioned
