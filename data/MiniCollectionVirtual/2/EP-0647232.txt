<ABSTRACT>
A method of using azlactone-functional supports to separate proteinaceous materials from non-proteinaceous materials is disclosed. Deproteinization with azlactone-functional supports can retain biological activity of the non-proteinaceous material and can bind both net-positive and net-negative proteinaceous materials from biological fluids. A method for controlling restriction enzyme activities in a biological fluid is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for controlling restriction enzyme
activities in biological fluid comprising non-proteinaceous, genetic material and
restriction enzyme.Deproteinization is often an essential requirement in
the production or separation of high quality non-proteinaceous
materials. Non-proteinaceous materials include polysaccharides,
steroids, alkaloids, lipids, and genetic materials such as nucleic
acids, nucleotides, plasmids. However, a major difficulty occurs
because of a lack of a sufficient driving force to differentiate
non-proteinaceous materials from proteinaceous materials.
Proteinaceous materials include amino acids, peptides, proteins,
glycoproteins, lipoproteins, and others.Current deproteinization processes, such as solvent
precipitation, acid precipitation, salting-out procedures, ionexchange
adsorption, heat denaturation, ultra-filtration, ultra-centrifugation,
and dialysis, are time consuming and costly or
ineffective.U.S. Patent 4,421,653 discloses a process for the
deproteinization of biological fluids by removing the water
insoluble phase after adding to the fluid a water insoluble crosslinked
polycarbonic polymer. A water insoluble cross-linked diamine
(ethylenediamine or hexamethylenediamine) polycarbonic acid is one
of the deproteinizing agents employed.However, the polyvalent cationic surface of the diamine
polycarbonic acids provides non-specific adsorption of non-proteinaceous
materials, such as nucleic acids and polysaccharides,
which should be retained in the solution after deproteinization
process for further recovery or analysis.Additionally, U.S. Patent 4,923,978 discloses a process
for separating proteinaceous materials from nucleic acids involving
contacting a solution containing the proteinaceous materials and
nucleic acids with solid phase extraction materials capable of
binding proteins to form bound and unbound fractions and then
isolating the unbound fraction containing the nucleic acids.
Rehydrated silica gel is one of the solid phase extraction materials
employed, but the surface of the silica gel must be freed of
polyvalent cationic species if nucleic acids are to be
prevented from being adsorbed on the surface of the silica 
particles. Three methods are disclosed to achieve a solid phase
extraction material which is useful. But such methods involve
difficult and time consuming processes.U.S. Patent 5,004,806 (Kung) discloses a method to
remove proteins from a solution containing polynucleotides and
proteins by filtering the solution through a
