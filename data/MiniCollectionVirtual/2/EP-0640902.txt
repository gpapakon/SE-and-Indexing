<ABSTRACT>
A method for programming a computer controlled multi-axis device (for 
example a CNC machining device) is provided. First a measurement probe (for 

example a simulated cutting tool (402)) of a passive three dimensional 
coordinate measuring machine (CMM) (10) is operated by an experienced 

operator manually through a selected three dimensional path (404); thus 
developing and storing three dimensional data of position and/or orientation of 

the measurement probe. These data are transferred to the controller of the 
multi-axis device to replicate with the multi-axis device the selected path. A 

preferred CMM (10) comprises a lightweight, multi jointed measuring arm (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method for programming the tool path 
of a multi-axis machine tool or robot. A serious limitation in the practical usage of CNC or computer 
numerically controlled devices such as robotics and 5-axis machine centers is 
the time and effort required to program intricate and convoluted paths prior to 
performing typical robotic functions (such as welding or sanding) and/or typical 
machine tool functions (such as machining complex molded parts). Presently, 
this programming process entails a careful and meticulous step-by-step 
simulation based on trial and error. The object of the present invention is to provide a method that 
facilitates programming of a computer controlled multi-axis device. According to the present invention, this problem is solved by a method 
comprising the steps of: 
a) operating a measurement probe of a passive three dimensional 
coordinate measuring machine (CMM) through a selected three dimensional 
path or operation; b) developing three dimensional data of position and/or orientation from 
step a) and storing said data; c) transferring said data to the controller of said multi-axis device; and d) causing the multi-axis device to replicate the selected path or 
operation based on said data developed by the coordinate measuring 
machine. The method according to this invention allows for example easy 
programming of the complex paths required for operations of robotics and  
 
multi-axis machine centers in the performance of typical functions such as 
sanding or welding (commonly associated with robotics) and machining 
molded parts (commonly associated with multi-axis machine tools). In 
accordance with this method, it is possible to easily replicate in a computer 
controlled machine, the operation or path (defined both by direction and/or 
orientation) of an experienced human operator. This is accomplished using the 
measurement probe of an independant, passive three dimensional CMM. The 
measurement probe or digitizer end of the CMM is for example a simulated 
tool. The CMM operator may thus use a lightweight, easy-to-handle passive 
electrogoniometric device and emulates either a desired tool path or 
manufacturing operation. As this path or operation is emulated, the position 
and orientation data (in both the X, Y and Z directions and/or I, J and K 
orientations) of the CMM is accumulated and stored. This data is then 
transferred, preferrably using industry standard formats, to a computer 
numerically controlled (CNC) device such as a robot
