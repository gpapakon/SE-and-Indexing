<ABSTRACT>
The inventiomn relates to a synthetic resin sheet manufactured from a 
first thermoplastic synthetic resin comprising a coating layer from a thermoplastic 

synthetic resin composition, comprising a second thermoplastic synthetic resin, a 
polyacrylate with free, reactive hydroxyl groups and - per 100 parts by weight of the 

second thermoplastic synthetic resin - from 1 to 6% by weight of electrically 
conductive carbon black. The side of the synthetic resin sheet on which the coating 

layer has been provided, has an accurate and reproducibly adjustable surface 
resistivity from 100,000 to 100,000,000,000 Ohms per square. The synthetic resin 

sheet together with the coating layer provided thereon may be formed to articles by 
means of thermoforming. The surface resistivity remains substantially unchanged by 

the thermoforming.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a synthetic resin sheet manufactured from a 
first thermoplastic synthetic resin and comprising at least one coating layer of a 
thermoplastic synthetic resin composition which comprises a second thermoplastic 
synthetic resin, a polyacrylate with free reactive hydroxyl groups and - per 100 parts 
by weight of the second thermoplastic synthetic resin - 1 to 6 parts by weight of 
electrically conductive carbon black. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing the synthetic 
resin sheet according to the invention in which a lacquer system consisting of one 
more solvents and a thermoplastic synthetic resin composition which comprises a 
second thermoplastic synthetic resin, a polyacrylate having free, reactive hydroxyl 
groups and - per 100 parts by weight of the second thermoplastic synthetic resin - 1 to 
6 parts by weight of electrically conductive carbon black, is provided on at least one 
side of the synthetic resin sheet and is then dried. The invention further relates to the lacquer system itself used and 
articles obtained from the synthetic resin sheet according to the invention by 
thermoforming. Synthetic resin sheets manufactured from thermoplastic synthetic resins 
are generally known. They are manufactured and used on a large scale. In many 
applications, articles are formed from the synthetic resin sheets by further processing 
methods. Synthetic resin sheets manufactured from thermoplastic synthetic resins are  
 
particularly suitable to obtain therefrom articles by thermoforming. In the 
thermoforming process the synthetic resin sheet is heated, usually to a temperature 
above the glass transition temperature of the synthetic resin from which the sheet has 
been manufactured, and is then deformed. The forces required for the deformation 
can be obtained by using a vacuum; in that case there is sometimes referred to 
vacuum forming. The properties of synthetic resin sheets may be varied by varying the 
nature of the synthetic resin from which the sheet has been manufactured or by 
manufacturing the sheet from synthetic resin compositions which consist of synthetic 
resins and additives. Another possibility - particularly when certain surface properties 
are desired - is to provide the synthetic resin with a coating layer having certain 
properties. It is then often preferred to provide a coating layer which is also built up 
from a thermoplastic material. When the coating layer consists of a thermoplastic 
material it is in general well possible
