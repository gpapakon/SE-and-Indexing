<ABSTRACT>
To obtain a washing machine capable of sanitarily 
effecting washing with fresh water at all times and reducing 

a washing time and a drying time. Tap water supplied from a 
water feed pipe in association with sensing means is 

pressurized to predetermined pressure by a pressurizing pump, 
supplied to water injection nozzle pipes and injected into a 

washing space through water injection nozzles. The user 
inserts tableware held by hands between the nozzles, 

energising the sensor mechanism. A high speed water flow 
injected from the nozzles collides against the tableware and 

washes the tableware by removing stubborn dirt from the 
tableware. On the other hand, an air flow from a blower 

passes though the air nozzle pipes and is discharged from the 
air nozzles to remove the drops of water attached to the 

tableware by forced air action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a washing apparatus for
washing tableware, foods and the like by a water injection
flow and, more particularly, to a washing apparatus permitting
an easy washing operation during cooking or after meals.FIG. 18 is a longitudinal cross sectional view showing a
tableware washing apparatus disclosed in, for example,
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 55-34041.In the figure, reference numeral 1 denotes a washing
apparatus main body, numeral 2 denotes a water supply valve
disposed above the rain body 1, numeral 3 denotes an inner
vessel disposed in the main body 1, numeral 4 denotes a
nozzle bearing fixed on the bottom surface of the inner
vessel 3, numeral 5 denotes a water injection nozzle
rotatably supported by the nozzle bearing 4, numeral 6 denotes
a tower nozzle fixed at the center of the water injection
nozzle 5, numeral 7 denotes a lower basket disposed just
above the water injection nozzle 5 and supported by the side
wall of the inner vessel 3 to accommodate tableware 8, and
numeral 9 denotes an upper basket disposed above the tower
nozzle 6 and supported by the side wall of the inner vessel 3
to accommodate the tableware 8.Reference numeral 10 denotes a recessed portion formed to
a portion of the bottom surface of the inner vessel 3 and
provided with a waste food filter 11, numeral 12 denotes a
pump having a suction port connected to the recessed portion
10 through a suction pipe 13 and a discharge port connected to 
the bearing 4 through a discharge pipe 14, and numeral 15
denotes a drain pipe connected to the bottom of the recessed
portion 10 and piped to the outside of the washing apparatus
main body 1.In the conventional tableware washing apparatus arranged
as described above, the tableware 8 are accommodated in the
lower basket 7 and the upper basket 9 and set in the inner
vessel 3. Thereafter, tap water supplied to the inner vessel
3 by opening the water feed valve 2 is mixed with detergent
and the pump 12 is driven. The washing water sucked by the
pump 12 is discharged through the discharge pipe 14 and jetted
upward from the water injection nozzle 5 and washes the
tableware 8 in the lower basket 7 while being rotated by the
reaction of the injection action. In the same way, the tower
nozzle 6 also rotates while jetting washing water and washes
the tableware 8 in the upper basket 9.The washing water by which the tableware 8 are washed as
described above falls in the inner vessel 3 and flows into the
recessed portion 10. Then, the washing water is cleaned
