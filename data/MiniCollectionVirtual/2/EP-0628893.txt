<ABSTRACT>
In a transfer arrangement where a transfer roller (1) and 
a photoreceptor drum (10) are arranged to be out of contact with 

each other, the transfer roller (1) is arranged above the 
photoreceptor drum (10) so that the transfer of the toner image 

onto the transfer sheet (P) is performed above the photoreceptor 
drum (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer arrangement, 
and more specifically, to a transfer arrangement incorporated in 
an image forming apparatus such as an electrographic copying 
machine, a printer and a facsimile machine for electrostatically 
transferring a toner image formed on the surface of an electrostatic 
latent image carrier incorporated in the apparatus onto 
a sheet of paper such as a transfer sheet by means of a transfer 
roller. The following two are typical transfer methods employed for 
the transfer arrangement incorporated in the image forming 
apparatus: a non-contact-type corona transfer method using a 
corona discharger as a means for supplying a charge to the 
electrostatic latent image carrier; and a contact-type bias 
roller transfer method using a conductive roller as the charge 
supplying means. A transfer arrangement employing the corona transfer method 
includes a corona discharger. As schematically shown in Fig. 1, 
a corona discharger 22 is arranged so that a necessary gap is 
left between the corona discharger 22 and a photoreceptor drum 
21 used as the electrostatic latent image carrier. The corona 
discharger 22 charges a transfer sheet P conveyed through the 
gap between the rotary photoreceptor drum 21 and the corona  
 
discharger 22 by applying a corona charge of a polarity reverse 
to that of toner from the reverse side of the transfer sheet P. 
Thereby, the transfer sheet P is made to partly adhere to the 
surface of the photoreceptor drum 21, and the charged toner on 
the surface of the photoreceptor drum 21 is transferred onto the 
transfer sheet P by a Coulomb force. However, when the transfer arrangement employing the corona 
transfer method is used, a means is necessary for separating the 
transfer sheet P from the surface of the photoreceptor drum 21 
since the transfer sheet P adhering to the surface of the 
photoreceptor drum 21 does not easily come off spontaneously. 
In addition, since a high voltage is applied to the corona 
discharger 22, discharge products such as ozone which is harmful 
to the human body and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are generated in a 
considerable amount. A transfer arrangement employing the bias roller transfer 
method includes a transfer roller made of urethane resin 
provided with conductivity by being mixed with a carbon or 
alkali metal. As schematically shown in Fig. 2, a transfer 
roller 23 is arranged to be rotatively in contact with the 
photoreceptor drum 21. The transfer roller 23 presses the 
transfer sheet P passing
