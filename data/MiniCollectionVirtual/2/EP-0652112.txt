<ABSTRACT>
In a mimeographic printing machine in which a 
mimeographic stencil paper is initially set in such a manner 

that the front leading end of the mimeographic stencil paper 
is located in a stencil paper passageway between stencil 

making means and a rotary cylindrical printing drum, the 
mimeographic printing machine has stencil paper conveying 

means, a stencil paper sensor and control means. The control 
means controls the stencil paper conveying means as follows: 

In the case where the stencil paper sensor does not detect 
the presence of the stencil paper when the stencil paper is 

initially set, the control means causes the stencil paper 
conveying means to forwardly move the stencil paper until, 

after the sensor detects the passage of the front leading end 
of the stencil paper, the front leading end of the stencil 

paper reaches a predetermined position. On the other hand, 
in the case where the sensor detects the presence of the 

stencil paper when the stencil paper is initially set, the 
control means causes the stencil paper conveying means to 

backwardly move the stencil paper until the sensor detects 
the passage of the front leading end of the stencil paper, 

and then to forwardly move the stencil paper until, after the 
sensor detects the passage of the front leading end of the 

stencil paper, the front leading end of the stencil paper 
reaches the predetermined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mimeographic printing 
machines, and more particularly to a mimeographic printing 
machine having stencil making means in which a mimeographic 
stencil paper is initially set in such a manner that the 
front leading end of the stencil paper is positioned in a 
mimeographic stencil paper passageway between the stencil 
making means and a rotary cylindrical printing drum. A mimeographic printing machine is well known in the 
art in which a continuous-sheet-shaped mimeographic stencil 
paper is supplied to stencil making means, where the stencil 
paper is processed to provide a stencil while being conveyed 
towards a rotary cylindrical printing drum by a platen roller 
and others in the stencil making means, and the stencil paper 
thus processed is conveyed to the rotary cylindrical printing 
drum by the platen roller and master feed rollers proved 
ahead of the platen roller so that the stencil is set on the 
drum. An example of the machine has been disclosed, for 
instance, by Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication (OPI) No. 
Sho. 59-143679 (the term "OPI" as used herein means an 
"unexamined publication"). In the above-described conventional machine, a new  
 
stencil paper is initially set in the stencil making section 
by hand. In this initial stencil paper setting operation, 
the stencil paper is liable to be variable in set position. 
In order to overcome this difficulty, after the stencil paper 
is set in the above-described manner, the following method is 
employed: That is, a stencil paper cutter is provided in the 
stencil paper passageway between the stencil making means and 
the rotary cylindrical printing drum. The front leading end 
portion of the stencil paper thus set is cut with the cutter 
so that the front leading end of the stencil paper is at the 
predetermined initial position. However, the above-described method of setting the 
front leading end of the stencil paper at the predetermined 
initial position is disadvantageous in the following points: 
When the front leading end portion of the stencil paper is 
cut, a piece of stencil paper is formed as a waste at the 
end, remaining in the stencil paper passageway. It must be 
removed by the operator. If the machine is operated without 
removal of the waste from the stencil paper passageway, then 
it will obstruct the conveyance of the stencil paper in the 
machine, and may stick on the outer surface of the rotary 
cylindrical printing drum, thus adversely affecting the 
printing operation. Furthermore, after

A mimeographic printing machine in which a 
mimeographic stencil paper is initially set in such a manner 

that the front leading end of the mimeographic stencil paper 
is located in a stencil paper passageway between stencil 

making means and a rotary cylindrical printing drum, said 
mimeographic printing machine comprising: 


stencil paper conveying means which is driven 
selectively in a forward direction or in a reverse direction 

to selectively carry out a forward conveyance of conveying 
the stencil paper from said stencil making means towards said 

cylindrical printing drum or a reverse conveyance of 
returning the stencil paper towards said stencil making 

means; 
a stencil paper sensor provided in said stencil paper 
passageway, for detecting the presence or absence of the 

stencil paper therein; and 
control means for controlling said stencil paper 
conveying means as follows: 


in the case where said sensor does 
not detect the presence of the stencil paper when the stencil 

paper is initially set, said control means causes said 
stencil paper conveying means to forwardly move the stencil 

paper until, after said sensor detects the passage of the 
front leading end of the stencil paper, the front leading end 

of the stencil paper reaches a predetermined position, and  
 
in the case where said sensor detects 
the presence of the stencil paper when the stencil paper is 

initially set, said control means causes said stencil paper 
conveying means to backwardly move the stencil paper until 

said sensor detects the passage of the front leading end of 
the stencil paper, and then to forwardly move the stencil 

paper until, after said sensor detects the passage of the 
front leading end of the stencil paper, the front leading end 

of the stencil paper reaches said predetermined position. 
A mimeographic printing machine according to 
claim 1, wherein said stencil paper conveying means further 

comprises a first stencil paper feed roller located upstream 
of said stencil paper sensor in said paper passageway, a 

first motor for driving said first stencil paper feed roller 
forwardly and backwardly in accordance with said control 

means, a second stencil paper feed roller located in said 
paper passageway between said stencil paper sensor and said 

first stencil paper feed roller, a second motor for driving 
said second stencil paper feed roller, and a one way clutch 

connecting between said second stencil paper roller and said 
second motor, said one way clutch being transmitting the 

forward rotation of said second motor to said second stencil 
paper roller and allowing the backward rotation of said 

second stencil paper roller free from said second motor.  
 
A mimeographic printing machine according to 
claim 1, further comprising a stencil paper feed sensor 

located in said stencil paper passageway between said stencil 
paper sensor and said rotary cylindrical printing drum.
