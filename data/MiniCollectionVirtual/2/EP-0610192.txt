 BP-6430 TITLE Ether Derivatives Of Alkyl Piperidines And Pyrrolidines As Antipsychotic Agents FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel unsaturated ether derivatives of alkyl piperidine and pyrrolidine compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, methods of preparation, and methods of using these compounds as antipsychotics.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTraditional antipsychotic agents such as phenothiazines, e.g., chlorpromazine, and most butyrophenones, e.g., haloperidol, are potent dopamine receptor antagonists which produce a number of undesirable and irreversible side effects such as Parkinson-like motor effects or extra-pyramidal side- effects (EPS) , and dyskinesias including tardive dyskinesias at high doses. JA 065641, Abstract, August 26, 1971 describes propenyla ine derivatives useful as antipsychotic, analgesic, antihypertensive and antiinflammatory agents JA 061710, Abstract, August 6, 1969, describes 4- amino-2-butynyloxy beta-nitro-styrenes useful as antitumor agents which can be prepared from 2-propionyl- beta-nitro-styrenes.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention have the formula: 
I 
I R(i)wherein: n is 0, 1, or 2; p is 0 or 1; m is 1, 2, or 3;X is -C=C- or R1C=CR2 (cis or trans) ;R1 and R2 independently are H, alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms, or phenyl;Ar is naphthyl or phenyl, optionally substituted with 1-5 substituents individually selected from N02, halogen, CF3, SH, alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1-4 carbon atoms, hydroxy alkyl of 1-4 carbon O 0 0 atoms, -C-R3, -NR3R4, -C-NR3R4, -NR3CR4, or S(0)qR5 where q is 0, 1, or 2;R3 and R4 independently are H, alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms, or phenyl; R5 is alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms or phenyl; R is H, alkyl of 1-5 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 3-6 carbon atoms, Ar^ where Ar-*- is phenyl or naphthyl, or -CH=CR6R7; and R^ and R7 independently are H or alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms, provided that when n=0 the side chain is not located at the 2-position of the ring; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds. 

 In another embodiment, this invention includes a method of using these compounds as antipsychotic agents.Finally, this invention includes processes for making the compounds of this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONCompounds of the invention are related to antipsychotic agents which are selective sigma receptor antagonists rather than the traditional dopamine receptor blockers known in the art.
