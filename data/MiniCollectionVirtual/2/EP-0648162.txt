<ABSTRACT>
A copy preventing sheet-form screen (11) comprises a lenticular screen (19) formed by a sheet of transparent plastic material having a series of adjacent lens portions (13) with major optical axes perpendicular to the front face and a series of light blocking striae (16) located spaced apart underlying respective lens portions. The striae extend across a major part of the major optical axes so that when covering a sheet printed with meaningful information, the screen enables the information to be easily seen when viewed obliquely in ambient white light but prevents a meaningful copy thereof being made by conventional, perpendicularly aligned, phototransference technique. The screen can be attached to the printed sheet by adhesive (18) or formed as an adhesive tape to cover only preselected areas of printing. The screen may also form one or both sides of a security envelope enclosing the printed sheet and sealed by a security label carrying an authorized signature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and device for
preventing meaningful copies of sheets of information being
made by the usual perpendicularly aligned, phototransference
techniques such as xerographic, offset printing, and
facsimile processes.The importance of preventing unauthorized copying by
such phototransference techniques confidential and other
meaningful information such as customer lists, formulae,
plans, designs and signatures is well recognized.Previous attempts at copy prevention have not proven
entirely satisfactory. Such approaches have, for example,
included printing the information on paper colored to
provide insufficient contrast with the printed material when
photocopied by xerographic or electrostatic copying
techniques but legible to the naked eye in ambient white
light. However, such approaches require specially dedicated
paper and printing techniques as limitations are imposed on
the colors of print and paper and the contrast is usually
considered to be rather poor so as to render the document
somewhat difficult to read, particularly at a distance,
unattractive to both read and handle and generally
aesthetically undesirable.Another approach has been to print the information in
a color, such as yellow, to which the standard copier is
relatively insensitive.Examples of such prior approaches are taught by US
Patent 4,632,429 issued December 30, 1986 to Gardner; US
4,522,429 issued June 11, 1985 to Gardner and US 4,281,931 
issued August 4, 1981 to Van Auken.It is known to provide displays in which two or more
pictures or words can be seen by varying the viewing angle,
often to provide a motion or a three dimensional effect, by
splitting representations of the different pictures or words
into striae, arranged alternately in association with
optical screen structures which provide preferential
reflection of the respective striae at the differing angles
of incident light. However, none of these proposals teach
the present invention.Examples of optical screen structures used for this
purpose, including some which incorporate lenticular
screens, are taught in US 3,119,195 issued January 28, 1964
to Broaunhut ; US 3,586,592 issued June 22, 1971 to Cahn;
US 1,475,430 issued November 27, 1923 to Curwen; US 3,

issued September 25, 1957 to Anderson and US, 1,969,551
issued August 7, 1934 to Francis. Lenticular screens are also disclosed in EP-A-219012 and in
EP-A-323108, in which the screens are an integral part of
data carriers or security

<CLAIMS>
A device for preventing the copying of indicia of
meaningful information on another sheet, while allowing an

image of the indicia to be easily seen when viewed
obliquely, comprising means for blocking light from

perpendicularly aligned phototransference techniques, and a
sheet-form overlay screen through which indicia on such

other sheet can be viewed obliquely in ambient white light
when the overlay screen is positioned in covering relation

to the other sheet, wherein the sheet-form
overlay screen (11, 11', 11'' or 11''')comprises a lenticular

screen (19) formed by a sheet of transparent material
having front (13) and rear faces and a series of adjacent

lens portions (14) with major optical axes perpendicular to
the front face, and the light blocking means comprises a

series of light blocking striae (16) located spaced apart
underlying respective lens portions of the screen and

extending across a major part of their major optical axes,
the spacing apart of the striae being such as to enable an

image of the indicia on such other sheet (21) to be easily
seen by virtue of the lens portions when viewed obliquely

through the front face of the screen in ambient white light
and the light blocking property and the extension of the

striae being such as to prevent a meaningful copy of the
indicia being made by conventional phototransference

techniques, perpendicularly aligned to the front face of
the screen, including at least one of xerographic, offset

printing, and facsimile, when the rear face of the overlay
sheet is positioned in covering relation to the other

sheet.
A sheet of material carrying indicia providing
meaningful information on the front face thereof covered by

a device for preventing the copying of the indicia, while
allowing an image of the indicia to be easily seen when 

viewed obliquely, wherein said device comprises means for
blocking light from perpendicularly aligned

phototransference techniques and a sheet-form overlay
screen through which indicia on such other sheet can be

viewed obliquely in ambient white light when the overlay
screen is positioned in covering relation to the other

sheet, wherein the sheet-form overlay screen
(11, 11', 11'' or 11''') comprises a lenticular screen (19)

formed by a sheet of transparent material having front (13)
and rear faces and a series of adjacent lens portions (14)

being such as to prevent a meaningful copy of the indicia
being made by conventional phototransference techniques,

perpendicularly aligned to the front face of the screen,
including at least one of xerographic, offset printing, and

facsimile, when the rear face of the overlay sheet is
positioned in covering relation to the other sheet.
A security envelope having opposite sides and a sheet
receiving opening at one end, and means for sealing the

envelope in closed condition, at least one of said sides
comprising a screen formed by a sheet of transparent

material so that a sheet marked with indicia providing
meaningful information inserted in the security envelope
