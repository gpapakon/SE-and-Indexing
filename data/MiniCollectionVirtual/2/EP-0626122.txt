<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a TDMA system and to a method of measuring adjacent base stations in a TDMA radio system. In the invention, dummy time slots (D) are inserted (III) to a TDMA signal sent by a base station (BS1). These dummy time slots offset the time slots of two carriers (BS1, BS2, BS3) with respect to each other, and therefore, a mobile station locked to a predetermined time slot on one carrier is able to measure and decode any time slot of an adjacent carrier within a longer period of time for a possible handover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a TDMA (Time Division
Multiple Access) radio system and a method of measuring
signal strengths of adjacent base stations in a
TDMA radio system for a possible handover.In mobile communication systems, such as cellular
radio systems or trunking radio systems, mobile
radio stations may move freely from one radio cell to
another. When leaving a previous radio cell, a mobile
station has to search for another cell and to register
to this new cell. In order to be able to make
handover from one cell to another during an on-going
call without significant break in the call, the mobile
station should be prepared for a change of cell
preferably all the time, by monitoring the carriers
of the base stations of adjacent cells. Thus there is
continuously available precollected information on
the coverage of the adjacent cells and the mobile
station or the fixed network is capable of making
quick decision to choose the best adjacent cell for
a handover, when the carrier of the present cell becomes
weaker. Thus a handover may be performed for
instance during a call without noticeable break in
the call.In radio systems of TDMA type, a plurality of
physical channels, i.e. time slots, are arranged for
each carrier of a base station by time division multiplexing.
In Figure 1 for example, four time slots
0, 1, 2 and 3 are repeated on the carriers of base
stations BS1 and BS2. On these physical channels are 
conveyed logical channels, which may be divided into
two categories: traffic channels transmitting user
information and control channels transmitting signalling
messages. When a mobile station MS is registered
to a base station BS and monitors the carrier
thereof, it is normally locked to one of the TDMA
time slots, e.g. the time slot 0 of a base station
BS1 in Figure 1. The other time slots 1, 2 and 3 of
BS1 are then of no significance for the MS and therefore,
the MS may measure the carriers of the adjacent
base stations during these time slots. If only measurement
of the intensity of a received signal is
required and no decoding of the time slot of the adjacent
carrier is necessary, no problems will appear
with finding the correct time slot. Still, the
switching time (the time required for tuning from one
frequency to another) of a synthetizer of the MS has
then to be short enough. However, if it is necessary,
besides measuring the intensity of the received signal,
to decode the information contained in the time
slot, in order to derive e.g. base station identification,
system identity, traffic

<CLAIMS>
A method of measuring adjacent base stations
in a TDMA radio system, comprising mobile radio stations

(MS) and a fixed radio network having base stations (BS),
each of which has at least one carrier, on which carrier

control and traffic channels are conveyed in at lest one
TDMA time slot (0, 1, 2, 3), in which method a mobile

station (MS) is locked to one time slot of a base station
(BS1) and measures occasionally control channel time

slots of the carriers of the adjacent base stations (BS2,
BS3) for a possible handover, 
characterized

in that dummy time slots (D) are randomly inserted
between normal time slots (0, 1, 2, 3) of a TDMA signal

to be sent on the carrier of the base station (BS1, BS2,
BS3), for the purpose of making it possible to measure

the carriers of the adjacent base stations.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the number of said dummy time
slots (D) to be sent one after another is varied

randomly, preferably between the values 1 and 2.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that said dummy time slots (D) are
sent between frames (FR1) formed by normal time slots (0,

1, 2, 3).
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3,

characterized
 in that said dummy time slots
(D) are sent between multiframes formed by several

frames.
A method according to any of the foregoing
claims,

(D) are inserted.
A method according to claim 5,

change in the time slot numbering is sent to the mobile

station (MS).
A method according to claim 6, 
characterized

in that the advance information is sent in
a frame (FR1) or a multiframe (MFR) preceding a dummy

time slot (D) within a time slot to which the mobile
station is locked.
