<ABSTRACT>
An electroluminescence apparatus in which a 
voltage is applied to a lamination of a fluorescent 

material layer and a dielectric layer through a pair of 
electrodes one of which is light-transmissible to 

extract fluorescence. A reflecting mirror layer is 
provided on the lamination while a particular relationship 

is established between the refractive index and the 
thickness of the lamination, thereby improving the 

efficiency with which the fluorescence is extracted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thin-film
electroluminescence apparatus and, more particularly, to
a thin-film electroluminescence apparatus suitable for
thin-film flat displays for use with information
terminal of office automation systems.A display based on a thin-film electro-luminescence
(hereinafter referred to simply as "thin-film
EL") apparatus has been proposed which has a
construction described below. Fig. 1 shows a structure
in which dielectric layers 4 and 6 are provided on two
sides of a fluorescent material layer 5, and these
layers are interposed between a transparent electrode 2
and a back electrode 7.
A corresponding structure is disclosed in DE2 260 205 B2
Thin-film EL displays in which
ZnS: Tb, F for green luminescence or ZnS: Mn for orange
luminescence is used for the fluorescent material layer
5 are known. In all cases, emitted light is extracted
through a glass surface on one side of the layers where
the transparent electrode is provided, and the intensity
of light thereby extracted is at most about 10% of that
of the light emitted from the emission center of the
fluorescent material layer.This cause is based on the Fresnel's law, that
is 90% or more of the light emitted from the emission
center of the fluorescent material layer is reflected by 
the interface between the fluorescent material layer and
the dielectric layer or between the latter and the
transparent electrode. This is because the angle of
total reflection to the emission wavelength is
considerably small, that is, it is about 25°.On the other hand, a method is known in which
a Fabry-Perot interferometer is used for selecting the
wavelength of light emitted from a light source having a
wide range of emission wavelength. The Fabry-Perot
interferometer allows transmission of light only when
the light satisfies the following optical interference
condition:
L·q = K·π
(π: circular constant)
where L represents the distance between a pair of
reflecting mirrors 8 disposed parallel to each other as
shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, q represents the number of
waves between the reflecting mirrors, and K is a
positive integer. It has been actually found that as
the reflectivity R of the reflecting mirrors is
increased, the half width of the spectrum of light
becomes narrower, as shown in Figs. 3a and 3b. This
phenomenon is described on pages 51 to 56 of Laser
Physics Nyumon (Introduction to Laser Physics) written
by Khoichi Shimota (published on Apr. 22, 1983 by
Iwanami Shoten). It is also known that this interferometer can
be used as a laser
