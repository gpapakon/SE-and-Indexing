<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal (heat-sensitive) 
recording material for drafting. A high speed (10 to 25 mm/sec) thermal recording 
apparatus, which provides high definition images equal to 
those obtained by electrostatic plotters according to a 
CAD/CAM system, has been developed for use in place of an 
electrostatic plotter. This thermal recording apparatus is 
now sold at about half the price of electrostatic plotters. Advantages of such a raster system thermal recording 
apparatus are that the same drawing can be continuously 
output by using a repeat function, which avoids the need to 
take diazo copies, and an opaque thermal recording material 
can be used. A thermal recording material conventionally 
used in this type of recording apparatus is usually prepared 
by first calendering natural pulp paper having a Bekk's index 
of not more than 120 seconds to smooth the surface to a 
Bekk's index of from 150 to 1,100 seconds, providing a 
thermal (heat-sensitive) recording layer thereon, followed by 
drying, and then further calendering the thermal recording 
layer. In order to improve the ability to preserve originals 
and print at high speed, the use of opaque synthetic paper 
having an opacity of from 90 to 95% has been suggested. Such  
 
paper is known to be useful as a support for a thermal 
transfer image-receiving sheet as described in JP-A-63-222891, 
JP-A-63-290790, JP-A-63-307988 and JP-A-63-315293 
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application"). A thermal recording material, comprising the above-mentioned 
opaque synthetic paper as a support, has a high 
Bekk's index (600 to 2500 seconds; measured according to JIS 
P-8119), excellent high-speed printability, and record 
preservability. However, such a material is too smooth to 
allow for satisfactory pencil writing or erasure. There has 
been a need to improve these properties. There has also been 
a need to develop a semi-transparent thermal recording 
material capable of being copied onto diazo-type paper, like 
the recording material for a CAD electrostatic plotter. The present inventors previously proposed a semi-transparent 
thermal recording material capable of being 
copied in a diazo process, which comprises a synthetic paper 
support having thereon a thermal color forming layer (see JP-A-3-190787 
or EP-A-0434073 as equivalent). 
This support comprises a biaxially stretched 
resin film base layer, having on both sides thereof a 
uniaxially stretched thermoplastic resin film
