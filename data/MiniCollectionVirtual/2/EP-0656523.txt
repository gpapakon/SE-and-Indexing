<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device which is used as far as possible without gaps to sense or technically change (by engraving, inscribing, tracing) spherical surfaces by means of meridional rotary movement of the ball in conjunction with a spatially fixed arrangement of a probe, sensor or the like. Appropriate objects exist, for example, in the field of test engineering for monitoring the quality of steel balls, eg. for cracks, geometrical or surface faults and, inter alia, in the case of laser curing of the near-surface edge zone of special balls or, for example, when impressing (burning in) information carriers in ball surfaces. The ball to be scanned is set rotating in this case by a rotating cylinder in frictional contact and is overlaid with a second rotary movement, at right angles to the axis of the drive movement, by two cylindrical control rollers which also roll on the ball surface. The two cylindrical control rollers R are arranged symmetrically relative to the connecting line of the centre of the ball to the axis of the drive cylinder at an angle of alpha (0 DEG  
<
 alpha 
<
 90 DEG ) for the purpose of imparting this second rotary movement. At least one of the cylindrical control rollers is designed such that it can be guided (steered) about the guiding axis prescribed by the angle alpha. A guiding movement having the amplitude angle of beta (0 DEG 
<
 beta 
<
 betamax, where betamax is approx. 10 DEG  - 20 DEG ) is coupled in a precisely synchronous way to the ball drive by appropriate mechanical means.

A device for meriodional scanning of spherical surfaces, in which the sphere (K) to
be scanned with the aid of a sensor is driven by frictional contact with a rotating

cylinder (Z) and which is supported in longitudinal direction of that cylinder (Z) by two
limit stops (A) and in transverse direction by two cylindrical rollers, and which is

equipped with additional control devices (E
1
, E
2
, S, H), by which the sphere (K) is
superimposed with a second rotating motion acting vertically on the axis of the drive

motion,

characterized by the fact that, for the transmission of this second rotating motion, two
control cylinder rollers (R) following on the surface of the sphere are arranged

symmetrically under an angle Alpha to the connecting line between the center of the
sphere and the axis of the drive cylinder, whereat Alpha is between 0° and 90° and

lies in the same plane with the rotation axis of the cylinder (Z) and whereat at least
one of the control cylinder rollers (R) is designed steerable about the steering axis

determined by angle Alpha (a
1
, a
2
), and a steering motion with the amplitude angle
Beta between 0° and 20° is coupled exactly synchronous with the drive of the sphere

and that at least one sensor is used.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that both control cylinder
rollers (R) are arranged steerable and that their steering motion to each other takes

place with a phase lead of 180° in opposite phase.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that the coupling of the
steering motion on the control cylinder rollers (R) takes place through lever (H) with

the pendulum angle Gamma between 0° and 30° on the extended axis of these
control cylinder rollers (R), whereat the levers (H) are moved directly by the linkage

devices connected to cylinder (Z).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that means are provided by
which the control cylinder rollers (R) are pressed elastically against the surface of

sphere (K).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that the limit stops (A) are
formed by spheres of the same size located upstream and downstream in the

technological process.
