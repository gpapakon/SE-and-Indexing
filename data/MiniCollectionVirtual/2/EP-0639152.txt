<ABSTRACT>
A ventilation system for a moveable structure, such as a mobile livestock container. The system incorporates a number of elongate louvre panels (1) arranged within a rectangular frame structure (2) positioned within an elongate side panel of the container. The panels (1) are pivotable about a vertical axis (7), so as to regulate airflow within the container. The invention includes remote actuation of the panels, automatic control of panel position and motorised vehicles including the ventilation system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to ventilation systems, in particular for movable 
structures, such as mobile livestock containers. Livestock containers are usually provided with side vents which may 
be opened to control the airflow. The vents, known from the prior art are 
generally independent lengths of a material such as wood, running horizontally 
along the length of the container. These vents are opened or closed by 
moving along the vehicle and manually adjusting each one individually by 
moving them from a fully closed position to fully open, there being no 
provision for any intermediate setting. In addition, livestock containers are conventionally provided with 
internal guide rails to prevent the animals from pushing any parts of their 
bodies out of the vent apertures when the vents are open. Guard rails are 
typically horizontal bars, the maximum spacing between each bar being 
determined by official regulations. German Patent DE 909,989 discloses a ventilation system comprising 
a number of panels which are moveable between a first open configuration 
and a second closed configuration by means of a common actuator. 
Movement of the actuator in a first direction opens the panels and movement 
in a second direction closes the panels. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved 
ventilation system.  
 The invention provides a ventilation system in combination with a 
moveable structure, the combined system comprising a support structure 
having a plurality of elongate panels interconnectedly arranged for pivotal 
movement as a group, which panels, when the ventilation system is installed 
in a side panel of said moveable structure, extend substantially vertically and 
are each pivotable by means of one or more pivot members about a 
substantially vertical axis and are thereby moveable between a first, a second 
and a third position, the second position being intermediate said first and third 
positions, the ventilation system being characterised in that in said first 
position a forward facing passageway is formed between adjacent panels and 
forward motion of the moveable structure causes and promotes airflow 
through said passageway into an interior region of the moveable structure, in 
said second position said passageway extends substantially at right angles to 
the forward motion direction of the moveable structure so that viewing access 
between adjacent panels to the interior is substantially unimpeded, in said 
third position adjacent panels cooperate so as to cut off or

A ventilation system in combination with a moveable structure, the 
combined system comprising a support structure (2) having a plurality of 

elongate panels (1) interconnectedly arranged for pivotal movement as a 
group, which panels, when the ventilation system is installed in a side panel 

of said moveable structure, extend substantially vertically and are each 
pivotable by means of one or more pivot members (12) about a substantially 

vertical axis (6) and are thereby moveable between a first, a second and a 
third position, the second position being intermediate said first and third 

positions, the ventilation system being characterised in that in said first 
position a forward facing passageway is formed between adjacent panels and 

forward motion of the moveable structure causes and promotes airflow 
through said passageway into an interior region of the moveable structure, in 

said second position said passageway extends substantially at right angles to 
the forward motion direction of the moveable structure so that viewing access 

between adjacent panels to the interior is substantially unimpeded, in said 
third position adjacent panels cooperate so as to cut off or restrict air passage 

therebetween and, in positions intermediate said second and third positions, 
the passageway formed between adjacent panels is rearward facing. 
A system according to Claim 1, characterised in that the movable 
structure is a mobile livestock container. 
A system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the elongate 
panels (11) are interconnected by an actuating member (15) for said pivotal 

movement as a group.  
 
A system according to Claim 3 characterised in that the actuating 
member has a plurality of guide members (3), one for each panel (1), each 

guide member (3) being in sliding engagement with the associated panel. 
A system according to any of the preceding Claims characterised in that 
the position of each panel is infinitely variable between a fully open and a 

fully closed position. 
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that each panel is removable from the support structure (2). 
A system according to Claim 6, further characterised in that each panel 
(1) is removable by means of an axially movable pivot member (12). 
A system according to Claim 7, further characterised in that the 
movable pivot member (12) can be biased into a projecting position, but is 

movable against the bias into a retracted position, to free the panel (1). 
A system according to any one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that remote actuating means are provided operable from inside a vehicle 

cab. 
A system according to any one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that a temperature sensor is provided within the interior of the movable 

structure, associated with a control means for the automatic regulation of the 
position of the panels.  

 
A motorised vehicle for transportation of livestock characterised in that 
the vehicle is equipped with a ventilation system according to any one of the 

preceding Claims.
