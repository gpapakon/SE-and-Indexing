<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a universal clamp for supporting 
external wall mounted piping; said clamp being 

characterised by a single structural part having a flexible 
semicircular collar (1) internally supporting an opposing pair 

of flexible curved and intersecting jaws (2,3) whose end elements 
are positioned so that their respective concave sections 

face each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application concerns a universal clamp
for supporting the wall mounted piping commonly used for
external electrical, telephone or plumbing systems.When it is not possible to lay piping in ducts, the piping
is generally fixed to the wall by means of special wall
attachments.Currently, the most commonly used attachment system
consists of a metal or plastic hoop having a base that is
screwed or nailed to the wall, with a strap fitting into a
special clasp which permits the belt to slide only in the
direction required to gradually fasten the pipe in the loop
formed by said strap.Consequently, once the strap has been fitted into its clasp
it can no longer be removed.Although this type of irreversible fastening method ensures
that the strap will not loosen in time, it does however
limit the versatility of the hoop in that the same may in
fact only be used once. In the case of maintenance operations requiring temporary
removal of the piping, said hoops have to be removed and
replaced with new hoops once the repair has been completed.Another disadvantage of these hoops is that a different
hoop model is required for the different sized piping
available on the market since the length of the strap must
obviously be increased proportionally to the diameter of
the pipe; nor is it possible to use hoops with standardized
length in that these become awkward to handle in the case
of piping having a small cross-section.In order to resolve both these disadvantages the applicant
previously designed and patented a device that allows
repeated and unlimited assembly and disassembly of the pipe
without in any way damaging the fastening device itself.This device consists of a pair of plastic scissor type
clamps moulded in a single piece whose jaws are joined at a
centre welding seam that acts as pivoting and connection
pin for the same.One of the two jaws is shaped so that it may be fixed
against a wall by means of normal screws, while the other
jaw is characterised by a shaped element designed to
facilitate opening of the clamp by means of a pressure that
overcomes the resistance produced by an opposing spring
fitted between the ends of the jaw which automatically shut
the mobile jaw against the fixed jaw mounted on the wall.By opening the two jaws sufficiently it is possible to fit
pipes having different diameters between the same and to 
fasten the pipes with equal efficiency when the jaws close
automatically.The only disadvantage of said clamp is that the assembly of
the spring that automatically shuts the jaws

<CLAIMS>
A universal clamp for supporting wall mounted piping of
external electrical, telephone or plumbing systems of the type

consisting of a fork element supporting two pipe clamping jaws
characterised in that said fork element is composed of a

flexible semi-circular collar (1) internally supporting a pair of
intersecting opposing and symmetrical flexible jaws (2 and 3),

having an almost semi-circular profile, whose end elements are
positioned so that their respective concave sections face each

other.
A universal clamp according to claim 1 whereby jaw (2)
terminates with a pair of grasping claws (2b) separated by a

centre slot (2a) intersected by the middle claw (3b) with which
the other jaw (3) terminates.
A universal clamp according to claim 1 whereby the jaws
(2 and 3) are characterised by grooves (2d and 3d) at which the

width of the jaws (2 and 3) is halved so that the grooved jaw
sections house within each other when they intersect.
A universal clamp according to claim 1 characterised by
two abutting plates (2f and 3f) fitted in the opposing end

sections of the jaws (2 and 3), and connected by a curl (2g and 
3g) to the above opposing curved sections of the jaws (2 and

3); said plates (2 and 3f) being characterised by opposing pairs
of semi-circular loops (2h and 3h).
A universal clamp according to claim 1 characterised by a
deck (1a) having a centre hole at the centre of the semi-circular

collar (1).
A universal clamp according to claim 1 made of wire.
A universal clamp according to claim 1 realised in plastic.
A universal clamp according to claim 1 realised in metal
belt.
