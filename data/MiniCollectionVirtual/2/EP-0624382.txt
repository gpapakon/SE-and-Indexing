<ABSTRACT>
The clamp consists of a cam (2) which can turn inside a frame (1) in order to clamp a flexible tube (10) against one edge (9) of the frame. The cam is driven in rotation by a motor (5) and a reducing gear (4) having high moment of inertia. A set of Hall probes (6) detects the position of the cam and controls the operation of the motor. Application to portable appliances for automatically taking blood.

<CLAIMS>
Peristaltic security clamp especially for a portable automatic blood-taking
apparatus, comprising a cam that is entrained in rotation by a motor (5) and a reducer

(4), characterised in that the cam (2) is arranged to rotate inside a U-shaped structure
(1) and to pinch directly a flexible tube (10) against a rim (9) of the structure, and in

that a set of Hall effect sensors (6) detects the position of the cam and controls the
operation of the motor.
Peristaltic clamp according to claim 1, characterised in that two Hall effect
sensors (6) are mounted diametrically opposite to one another on the lower face of

the reducer (4).
Peristaltic clamp according to claim 1, characterised in that a small magnet (8)
is located on a wheel (7) at the lower end of the axle (3).
