<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a fully 
removable trailer hook (4), meaning that, when the lug 

end is removed the 7-pole or 13 pole socket comes 
with it. In the design dealt with in the present 

invention, the problem is solved by employing a 
bayonet joint for the mechanical portion and 

for, the electrical portion, by using a special 
contact-carrier block (5) capable of following the 

movements resulting from the insertion and removal 
operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a removable trailer hook with a tube attached with
mechanical devices to a vehicle and comprising a lug hook wherein at the bottom
of the tube a contact-carrier is provided, which holds outlets for connection to the
vehicle's electrical system, and wherein furthermore at the tube a contact-carrier is
provided, which holds outlets for connection with a trailer's electrical system, according
to the preamble of claim 1.It is common knowledge that the use of trailer hooks has been growing among
automobile drivers, who find themselves, with increasing frequency, needing to
hook onto their vehicles boat trailers or other small-size trailers, campers or similar
units.The installation of fixed type hooks has been obsolete for some time now, given
that they can pose a danger for unwary pedestrians who bump into the hook, as
well as posing a threat in the event of collision; in addition, they mark the appearance
of the vehicle. As a result, three has been a switch in recent years to removable
hooks, today used on an almost exclusive basis and consisting of a lug hook
which can be removed when not in use, thus eliminating any danger and minimizing
the negative effect on the vehicle's appearance.Removable trailer hook is described, for example, in the Swiss Patent CH 275
045, which deals with a purely mechanical means for hitching a trailer to the vehicle,
whereby the pins located on a removable trailer engage with the guiding slots 
inside the tube which is integral with the vehicles, so as to achieve a bayonet joint,
the Patent DE-U 6 911 648 deals with a removable trailer similar to the preceding
one, whereby the trailer is coupled with or separated from the vehicle by means of
a tube integral with the vehicle.The US Patent 4,348,035 deals with a removable trailer hook consisting of a bar
integral with the vehicle, another bar at the opposite end of a swiveling hitch for
coupling with the trailer and mechanical means for locking the hitch and the bar.All known removable trailer hook consist of detachable mechanical parts, which do
not provide for the simultaneous removal, with a single action, of the electrical
connection between the trailer and the vehicle.The object of this invention is a removable trailer hook of the known type, similar to
the one described in the Swiss Patent CH-A 275 045, which, however, also includes
a plug and socket type connector enabling the simultaneous mechanical
coupling of the trailer with the vehicle and the electrical connection between the
plug,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Removable trailer hook with a tube (1) attached with mechanical devices to
a vehicle and comprising a lug hook (4), wherein at the bottom of the tube

(1) a contact-carrier (5) is provided, which holds outlets for connection to
the vehicle's electrical system, and wherein furthermore at the tube (1) a

contact-carrier (9) is provided, which holds outlets for connection with a
trailer's electrical system,
characterized in
that inside the tube (1) are provided guide slots (2) and on the lug hook (4)
are provided pins (3) such that slots (2) and pins (3) act in combination as a

bayonet joint between the lug hook (4) and the tube (1),
that along the sides of the contact-carrier (5) are provided grooves (7)
which, by means of specially designed pins on the tube (1), define a second

bayonet joint for the contact-carrier (5), and
that a counter spring (8) is positioned between the bottom of the tube (1)
and the contact-carrier (5).
Trailer hook according to claim 1, characterized in that a ring nut (11) is
provided which ensures a connection between the tube (1) and the lug hook

(4) when the hook is in the hauling position. 
Trailer hook according to claim 2, characterized in that a spring-operated
tap (12) is provided equipped with a safety catch (13) which hooks onto the

ring nut (11) and prevents dirt and grime from entering the tube (1) when
the lug hook (4) is removed, in addition to ensure that the ring nut (11) does

not become unscrewed due to vibrations occuring during hauling.
Trailer hook according to claim 3, characterized in that the safety catch (13)
consists of a spring-operated pin (14) housed in the ring nut (11) when in

the safety position, wherein the pin inserts itself in a hole (16) located on the
lug hook (4).
