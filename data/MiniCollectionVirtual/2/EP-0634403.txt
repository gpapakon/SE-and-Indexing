<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel amides of
pyrazole carboxy acids.More particularly, the present invention relates
to amides of pyrazole carboxy acid displaying a high
acaricidal and insecticidal activity, to a process for
preparing them, and to their use for controlling
harmful mites and insects in agricultural, civil and
zootechnic fields.Amides of pyrazole carboxy acids displaying
acaricidal and insecticidal activity are already known
from European patent application Nos. 289,879;
307,801; 329,020; 365,925; 405,808; 462,573; 521,409.
However, the compounds disclosed in the above patent
applications display an only secondary insecticidal
activity. For example, EP-A-0 590 720 (published on April 6,1994) discloses 5 -
pyrazolecarboxylic acid amide-based compounds of general formula (I)

in which:
R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl
group or a benzyl group;R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl
group;Rx represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom such as chlorine,
fluorine or bromine, or a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl or haloalkyl group;
or R2 and Rx together represent a RHC-(CH2)n-CH2 group in which R
represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C3 alkyl group and n is a whole number
between 1 and 2;R3, R4, R5 represent, each independently, a hydrogen atom or a
linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl group;X1, X2, X3 and X4 represent, each independently, a hydrogen atom or
a halogen atom such as chlorine, fluorine or bromine;Ry represents a linear or branched C3-C6 haloalkoxyhaloalkoxy or
haloalkoxyhaloalkylthio group, a linear or branched C1-C6 haloalkylthio
group, a linear or branched C2-C6 haloalkenyl group or a linear or branched
C3-C6 haloalkoxyhaloalkenyl group.The present Applicant has found now that if the
amidic nitrogen atom is replaced by a poly-halogenated
benzyl group, compounds are obtained which display a
surprisingly high acaricidal and insecticidal
activity, higher than as displayed by the
corresponding N-benzyl pyrazole carboxamides known
from the prior art.Therefore, the object of the present invention
are the amides of pyrazole carboxy acids having the
general formula (I): 

wherein:
-- R1 and R2 represent, each independently, a linear
or branched C1-C4 alkyl radical;-- Rx represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a
linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl or haloalkyl
radical, a C1-C2 alkoxy or haloalkoxy radical; or
when R2 and Rx are taken jointly, they represent
a moiety

in which R represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C3
alkyl radical and n is an
