<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a leading cylinder in the 
drying group or groups provided with single-wire draw in a 

multi-cylinder dryer of a paper machine in the draw of the 
web (W). The multi-cylinder dryer comprises drying cylinders 

(K) heated by means of steam or equivalent, the web 
(W) being pressed by the drying wire (H) against the cylinder 

faces of said drying cylinders. The multi-cylinder 
dryer comprises leading or lower cylinders (10), on which 

the web (W) runs outside the drying wire (H), for example 
a felt. The leading cylinders (10) or rolls are provided 

with holes (15) passing through the mantle (11) of the 
leading cylinders (10) or rolls, said holes (15) open into 

the inner space (14) of negative pressure in the leading 
cylinder (10) or roll and, from the opposite end, into the 

grooves (13) in the mantle face of the rolls. The negative 
pressure (P₁) inside (14) the roll (10) is arranged to be 

transmitted to the grooves (13) provided in the outer face 
of the roll mantle (11), whereby an adhesion force (F) is 

applied to the web (W) through the grooes (13). A negative 
pressure (P₁) is applied to the entire inside mantle face 

(11b) of the roll (10) and free flow of air is permitted 
through the holes (15) from the area (S) above the cylinder 

(10) into the interior space in the cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a leading cylinder for use in 
the drying group or groups of a paper machine for supporting 
a paper web which runs on the outer face of a drying 
wire. In the case of the leading rolls of the single-wire 
groups in the drying section of a paper machine, a problem 
is how to make the paper web adhere to the wire on the 
lower face of the cylinder. On the lower cylinders or 
leading rolls, the web runs as the topmost layer while the 
wire remains between the web and the outer face of the 
cylinder. This problem does not occur in the case of the 
other rolls in a single-wire group as the paper web runs 
between the wire and the mantle face of the cylinder. Attempts have been made to solve the problem concerned 
by using suction rolls. The suction-roll solution 
is expensive. A suction box requires inside sealing ribs, 
which tend to be worn. When the sealing ribs operate as 
dry, the wear is even more extensive. Through the suction 
box of a suction roll, negative pressure is applied to the 
vacuum block inside the cylinder, which said vacuum block 
is, in the case of the lower cylinders in a single-wire 
group, placed in the lower half of the cylinder. By the 
intermediate of the negative pressure applied to said 
block, suction is applied expressly to the part of the 
cylinder face in which the paper web tends to be detached. 
Through bores in the mantle, negative pressure is applied 
through the felt to the paper web, which thereby adheres 
to the felt face. In prior art, a solution for said problem of the 
paper web tending to be detached is also known wherein an 
arrangement in accordance with the applicant's FI Pat. 
Appln. 851533 is used. In the Uno-Vac system concerned, a 
sort of a suction box is used in which no wearing seals 
placed against the inner face of the roll mantle are used.  
 
In said solution, a high-velocity air flow is applied to 
the proximity of the edge of the sucton box and the mobile 
mantle face. Said air flow produces a suction flow from 
the interior of the box, which said suction flow thereby 
prevents flow of air through the edge area in the opposite 
direction into the space of negative pressure. A negative 
pressure is applied to the interior of the suction box and 
transferred through the bores in the mantle to the web 
face. It can be considered that a drawback of said solution 
of equipment is its high-cost construction. An abundance 
of holes must be made into the mantle. The inner 
axle requires blow ducts of its own and suction ducts of 
its
