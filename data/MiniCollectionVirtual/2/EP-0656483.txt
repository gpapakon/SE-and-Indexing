<ABSTRACT>
A synthetic resin bearing comprised of synthetic resin-made 
upper (3) and lower (2) bearing cases and a synthetic resin-made 

bearing member (4) having a disk-shaped thrust bearing 
piece (45) and a hollow-cylindrical radial bearing piece (41) with a 

radially extending slit (42). The bearing member is disposed 
such that the radial bearing piece (41) is kept in sliding 

contact with an outer peripheral surface of a hollow 
cylindrical portion (22) of the lower bearing case (2), and the 

thrust bearing piece (45) is kept in sliding contact with a 
bottom of an annular recess (24) formed in the lower bearing 

case (2). The upper bearing case is assembled to the lower 
bearing case such that an annular engaging hook portion (37) is 

snappingly fitted over an annular engaging projecting 
portion (27) of the lower bearing case. Hermetically sealing 

portions due to labyrinth action are formed between the 
upper and lower bearing cases, respectively at the 

snappingly fitting portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bearing,
preferably a synthetic resin bearing which is, in use,
disposed between two members which rotate
relative to each other and is capable of smoothly supporting
the radial load and the thrust load, the synthetic resin
bearing being particularly suitable for use in a strut-type
suspension (MacPherson type) in a four-wheel drive vehicle.In general, a strut-type suspension is mainly used on a
front wheel of a four-wheel drive vehicle, and is arranged
such that a strut assembly, which incorporates a hydraulic
shock absorber in an outer cylinder formed integrally with a
main shaft, is combined with a coil spring. As the
structures of this type of suspension, there are the
following two structures: (1) a structure in which the axis
of the coil spring is positively offset with respect to the
axis of the strut, and the sliding of the piston rod of the
shock absorber incorporated in the strut is effected
smoothly, and (2) a structure in which the axis of the coil
spring is aligned with the axis of the strut.In either structure, a bearing is disposed between a
chassis-side mounting member and an upper spring seat of the 
coil spring to allow smooth rotation of the strut assembly
when the strut assembly rotates together with the coil
spring in a steering operation.As the bearing, a rolling bearing using balls or a
sliding bearing formed of a synthetic resin is used.However, the rolling bearing has a problem in that
fatigue failure can possibly occur in the balls due to very
small vibrations, vibrational load, and the like, thereby
making it difficult to maintain smooth steering operation
over extended periods of time.On the other hand, the sliding bearing formed of a
synthetic resin has a problem in that since the coefficient
of friction of the sliding bearing is high, the steering
operation is made heavy.Furthermore, in either type of the bearing, a dust seal
formed of an elastomeric resilient member is fitted between
surfaces of relative rotation for the purpose of preventing
the entry of foreign objects, such as dust, onto the sliding
surfaces. Since the dust seal is disposed between and in
close sliding contact with the surfaces of relative
rotation, there is a problem in that the sliding frictional
force is high during the steering operation, so that the
steering force is made heavy, and that particularly in the
case of the sliding bearing formed of a synthetic resin, the
steering force is made even heavier. To overcome these problems of the conventional art,
