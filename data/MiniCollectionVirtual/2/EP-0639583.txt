The antibiotics Salmycin A (C₄₁H₇₀FeN₇O₂₁, molecular weight 1052.9 g/mol), 
Salmycin B (C₄₁H₆₉FeN₆O₂₁, molecular weight 1037.88 g/mol) and Salmycin C 

(C₄₀H₆₇FeN₆O₂₁, molecular weight 1023.85 g/mol) are prepared by 
fermentation with Streptomyces violaceus 37290 (DSM 8286). The salmycines 

contain an amino-disaccharide component. The salmycines and their derivatives 
are used as a pharmaceutical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to antibiotics, which are called Salmycin A, B and 
C, to a process for the preparation thereof from Streptomyces violaceus 37290, 
the variants thereof and to their use as a pharmaceutical. Known iron containing antibiotics, socalled sideromycines, are ferrimycine [M. 
Bickel et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 43 (1960) 2105, albomycine [G. Benz et al., 
Angew. Chem. 94 (1982) 552], ferrocine [B. Katayama et al., J. Antibiotics 46 
(1993) 65] and danomycine [P. Huber et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 69 (1986) 236]. 
These antibiotics show high in vivo activities. However, they exhibit severe 
disadvantages. The activity of ferrocine is restricted to Pseudomonas strains. 
Danomycine is not stable. Albomycine can be produced only in small yields. Surprisingly, iron containing antibiotics were found, which do not exhibit the 
disadvantages of the known compounds and can be easily produced. The 
compounds according to the invention consist of an iron chelate and an amino-disaccharide-part. 
The structures of Salmycin A and B are represented by 
formulae Ia and Ib. Accordingly, the subject of the instant invention are compounds of formula I 
wherein X stands for -C₁₄H₂₄O₉NR, which is an amino-disaccharide group 
consisting of a hexose and an amino-heptose-unit; X contains a N-methyl group, 
but no carbamoyl or methoxy group; R denotes =NOH (a), =O (b); -OH and 
-H (c), -NH₂ and -H (d) or = N-O-R'(e); R' denotes phenyl or a branched or 
unbranched alkyl with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably with 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms, in particular with 1 to 3 carbon atoms and a compound of the formula 
C₄₀H₆₇FeN₆O₂₁ (Salmycin C) which has a molecular weight of 1023,9 g/mol as 
well as the chemical equivalents and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. R 
is either double-bonded (cases a, b and e) or stands for a single bonded 
substituent and a H-atom (cases c and d). Preferred are the compounds of formula I', 
wherein X stands for -C₁₄H₂₄O₉NR, which is an amino-disaccharide group 
consisting of a hexose and an amino-heptose-unit; X contains a N-methyl group, 
but no carbamoyl or methoxy group; R denotes = NOH (a), = O (b);
 
 
-OH and -H (c), -NH₂ and -H (d) or =N-O-R'(e); R' denotes phenyl or a branched 
or unbranched alkyl with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably with 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms, in particular with 1 to 3 carbon atoms as well as the chemical 
equivalents and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. R is either double-bonded 
(cases a, b and e) or stands for a single bonded substituent and a H-atom
