<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to certain bicyclic 
compounds having a nucleus formed of two fused six membered 

rings, for example, isoquinoline, isoquinolone, 
tetrahydronaphthalene, dihydronaphthalene, or tetralone, 

substituted with both basic and acidic functionality, which 
are useful in inhibition of platelet aggregation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bicyclic compounds
useful as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists for the
prevention of thrombosis.The most prevalent vascular disease states are
related to platelet dependent narrowing of the blood supply
such as atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, acute
myocardial infarction, chronic stable angina, unstable
angina, transient ischemic attacks and strokes, peripheral
vascular disease, arterial thrombosis, preeclampsia,
embolism, restenosis following angioplasty, carotid
endarterectomy, anastomosis of vascular grafts, and etc.
These conditions represent a variety of disorders thought
to be initiated by platelet activation on vessel walls.Platelet adhesion and aggregation is believed to
be an important part of thrombus formation. This activity
is mediated by a number of platelet adhesive glycoproteins.
The binding sites for fibrinogen, fibronectin and other
clotting factors have been located on the platelet membrane
glycoprotein complex IIb/IIIa. When a platelet is activated
by an agonist such as thrombin the GPIIb/IIIa binding site
becomes available to fibrinogen, eventually resulting in
platelet aggregation and clot formation.Heretofore it has been proposed to block these
thrombus formation sites by the use of various therapeutic 
agents.U.S. Patent No. 5,064,814 teaches N-amidinopiperidine
carboxyl cyclic amino acid derivatives as antithrombotic
agents.U.S. Patent 5,039,805 teaches various benzoic
acid and phenylacetic acid derivatives for the inhibition
of the binding of fibrinogen to the fibrinogen receptor,
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.Seven membered ring containing bicyclic
compounds are taught to be fibrinogen antagonists in PCT
International patent application WO 93/00095.EP 456835 describes bicyclic compounds having
fused six membered rings (quinazoline-3-alkanoic acid
derivates) which are reported to have an inhibitory effect
on platelet aggregation.PCT International patent application WO 93/08174
describes nonpeptidyl integrin inhibitors which are
bicyclic 6 and 7 membered fused ring systems which have
therapeutic applications in diseases for which blocking
platelet aggregation is indicated.Quinoline compounds have been recited in the
patent literature for a variety of medicinal uses. For
example, European Patent Application 0 315 399; U.S. Patent
No. 5,041,453; PCT Patent Application WO 89/04303, and PCT
Patent Application WO 89/04304 describe quinoline
derivatives useful as lipoxygenase inhibitors and/or
leukotriene antagonists possessing anti-inflammatory and
anti-allergic
