<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for treating waste water wherein waste water to be treated is passed along a tortuous path (17), preferably comprising alternate layers of an inert material, such as, sand, stainless steel balls or stones, and a carbon or carbonaceous material, such as, granular activated carbon or coke, whilst passing a mixture of ozone and oxygen therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and 
apparatus for treating waste water to clean , purify 
and re-oxygenate it. The efficient and economic cleaning, purification 
and re-oxygenation of waste water, particularly when 
such waste water is derived from agricultural or 
industrial processes, is of major importance to the 
populace and to the environment. For example, much of the water used in 
agriculture and in industry for the purpose of 
cleaning and processing food products, becomes 
contaminated with a wide range of organic and 
inorganic material during the process route. Most, if 
not all, of this contaminated water, is then 
discharged to public waterways and land drainage 
systems where it can then become a major source of 
contamination, thereby contaminating existing water 
supplies in certain circumstances. The cleaning, purification and re-oxygenation of 
such waste water by on-site small scale processing 
plant, prior to its being discharged to public 
waterways and drainage systems, substantially reduces 
the risk of contaminating public water supplies and 
reduces substantially the cost of processing water for 
public consumption. Also, in countries where there are little or no 
public water processing plants, the use of a small 
scale processing plant would reduce substantially the  
 
risk and incidence of water borne diseases, there 
again, being of substantial benefit to the populace 
and to the environment. Hitherto, contaminated waste water was, 
generally, not treated prior to its discharge to the 
public foul water sewer. However, that which is 
treated, is processed partially for the removal of 
certain known contaminating compounds only and it is 
not generally purified or re-oxygenated before final 
discharge and, therefore, remains as a potential 
source of contamination for the public water supply. In one prior art approach to treating liquid 
waste as disclosed in US Patent 4,351,734 (KAUFFMAN), 
the liquid is passed through a reaction zone 
containing a bed of electrically conductive particles, 
such as carbon or graphite, in which arcing occurs 
during the passage of pulsed airflow in contact with 
the liquid. This arcing leads to the production of 
ozone in the bed, the ozone acting to purify the 
liquid waste. The carbon or graphite particles act 
purely to conduct electricity and thereby create 
arcing during their intermittent contacts with porous 
electrodes. A primary object of this invention is to provide 
on-site, low cost waste water treatment plant which 
can
