<ABSTRACT>
A door beam (5) is provided above the entrance opening of a hangar. In order to dissipate the roof load and use load loading the door beam (5), said door beam (5) is supported by at least one underlying structure (1), which may be combined with a sliding-door leaf (1'). Provided on the lower and upper borders of the underlying structure (1) are rollers (9, 10), which are spaced apart at regular intervals from one another. In order to ensure uniform loading both of the upper bearing means of the door beam (5) and of the bottom foundation (6), pairs of upper rollers (9) are in each case mounted, via levers (7), on supports (16) which are guided in a vertically displaceable manner in the sliding-door area (1'). A freely rotatable pulley (15) is, furthermore, mounted on each support (16). A steel cable (18) is laid over each pulley (15) such that it loops around said pulleys (15) at the bottom in each case, which cable, in addition, is guided over deflection pulleys (14), mounted in a freely rotatable manner on the underlying structure (1), and is fixed on said underlying structure (1) by means of its ends (19). Consequently, the upper rollers (9) can only absorb forces of the same magnitude as the forces which are transferred, uniformly and of the same magnitude, from the lower rollers (10), which are mounted, via levers (7'), on push rods (20) which are fastened on the underlying structure (1), to the foundation (6).
