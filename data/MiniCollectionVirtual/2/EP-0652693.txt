<ABSTRACT>
A machine presenting a worktable (8) movable along 
a first axis (Y); and a crosspiece (11) fitted with a 

number of machining heads (12) and movable along a 
second axis (X) perpendicular to the first axis (Y). The 

crosspiece (11) presents a box structure, and two end 
portions (32) guided on two horizontal appendixes (34) 

of two fixed uprights (36). Between one of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for
mechanically machining boards, in particular printed
circuit boards. More specifically, the present invention
relates to a drilling or milling machine for
simultaneously machining a number of packs of printed
circuit boards by means of a corresponding number of
machining heads.Machines of the aforementioned type are known
wherein the worktable travels along a longitudinal axis,
normally referred to as the Y axis, and the machining
head is fitted to a carriage sliding transversely on a
fixed crosspiece along the so-called X axis. In view of
the low output of which they are capable, however, such
machines are unsuitable for mass production
applications.As is known, the electronic circuit industry
demands an ever-increasing number of printed circuit
boards which feature a large number of holes requiring
highly accurate, but at the same time low-cost, 
machining. Drilling machines have therefore been devised
featuring a number of drilling heads for simultaneously
machining respective packs of printed circuit boards on
a single worktable.One known drilling machine features a number of
machining heads on a crosspiece fixed to the machine
bed; and the worktable is moved selectively along the
horizontal X and Y axes, so that it is extremely complex
and expensive in design.Another machine for drilling printed circuit
boards features a fixed worktable, and the crosspiece
supporting the machining heads travels along the
longitudinal Y axis. The crosspiece supports two
machining heads traveling transversely along the
crosspiece, connected transversely to each other, and
moved along the Y axis by a common drive device.This type of machine presents several drawbacks,
foremost of which are the impossibility of maintaining a
precise constant distance between the two connected
machining heads; the impossibility of fitting the
crosspiece with more than two machining heads; and,
finally, the difficulty posed by longitudinal
displacement of the crosspiece. It is known from the document DE-C-37 19 167 a numerically
controlled machine for mechanically machining boards,
featuring a number of machining heads carried by a common
slide movable along the X axis, and a worktable movable
along the Y axis. The slide has a reversed U-shaped section
and is slidable on a crosspiece of a portal including two
end uprights. The front wall of the slide also supports a
number of tool stores associated to the machining heads.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
machine for
