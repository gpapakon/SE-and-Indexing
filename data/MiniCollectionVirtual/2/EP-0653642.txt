<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a system that determines whether 
pins (12) of electrical components (10) such as connectors, 

switches, and sockets are present and properly soldered to 
a printed circuit board (14). The system uses an 

oscillator (20) which supplies a signal, typically ten 
kiloHertz (10 kHz) at 0.2 volts, to the pin under test. A 

conductive electrode (30) is placed on top of the 
component. The electrode is connected to a current 

measuring device. Another pin of the component is 
connected (50) to a common signal return (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of copending 
application Serial No. 08/127,400 (attorney docket no. 
1092502-4), filed September 27, 1993, which is a 
continuation of application Serial No. 892,868, filed June 
3, 1992, now U.S. Patent No. 5,254,953, issued October 19, 
1993, which was a continuation-in-part of application 
Serial No. 631,609, filed December 29, 1990, now U.S. 
Patent No. 5,124,660 , June 23, 1992. The present invention relates generally to 
measuring and testing devices and more particularly to an 
apparatus and method for testing the integrity of a 
connection between a circuit assembly (e.g., printed 
circuit board) and a pin of an electrical component, such 
as a connector, push button switch, DIP switch, socket, 
integrated circuit, and the like. The technological background and the essential 
features of the present invention are described in 
application Serial No. 08/127,400, the parent of the 
present application, which is hereby incorporated by 
reference in its entirety. The parent application focussed 
on, but did not restrict the invention to, applications of 
the invention involving the testing of integrated circuits. 
The claims of this application are directed to use of the  
 
disclosed invention in connection with the testing of 
connectors, push button switches, DIP switches, sockets, 
and the like, as well as integrated circuits. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings depicts a 
connector 10 comprising a plurality of pins 12, a printed 
circuit board 14, and a board support fixture 16. The pins 
12 are typically soldered to a solder pad on the top 
surface of the board 14 or, alternatively, inserted through 
holes in the board and soldered to the bottom surface of 
the board. In addition, electrically conductive traces 
(not shown) are typically printed on a surface of the board 
14. These components are well known and are discussed 
herein only because one preferred application of the 
present invention involves testing solder joints between 
pins of an electrical connector and solder pads or other 
nodes of a printed circuit board with a bed of nails 
automatic tester. However, it should be noted that the 
present invention is by no means limited to connectors or 
to the one type of connector depicted in Figure 1. For 
further background information relating to the present 
invention, the reader is referred to the above-cited 
application Serial No. 08/127,400. According to the present invention, a system for 
measuring the integrity of an electrical contact between
