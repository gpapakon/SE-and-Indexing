<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for performing a nucleic acid 
amplification reaction and preferably a polymerase chain 

reaction (PCR) in a reaction mixture in at least one capillary 
tube. Several different embodiments are disclosed. One 

embodiment cycles a sample through a capillary tube loop passing 
through two thermostatted fluid baths. Another embodiment has 

the capillary tube routed alternatingly between two heat 
exchangers to that the sample makes only one pass through the 

tube. Other embodiments maintain the heat exchangers stationary 
and translate the samples between them. Still further 

embodiments maintain the samples stationary and either 
automatically translate or rotate the heat exchangers past the 

samples contained within the capillary tubes to perform the 
thermal cycles necessary for the amplification reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to amplifying nucleic acids by
thermal cycling and, more particularly, to automated machines
for performing amplification reactions such as a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR).DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) may be amplified by thermally
cycling a specially constituted liquid reaction mixture
according to protocol such as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
protocol which includes several incubations at different
temperatures. The reaction mixture is comprised of various
components such as the DNA to be amplified (the target) and at
least two oligonucleotide primers selected in a predetermined
way so as to be complementary to a portion of the target DNA.
The reaction mixture also includes various buffers, enzymes, and
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, such as dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and
dTTP. The duplex DNA molecule is denatured into two
complementary single strands. The primers then anneal to the
strands, and, in PCR, nucleoside monophosphate residues are then
linked to the primers in the presence of an enzyme such as a
thermostable DNA polymerase to create a primer extension
product. After primer extension, twice as many duplex DNA
molecules exist. This process is repeated, each time
approximately doubling the amount of DNA present. The result is
an exponential increase in the concentration of target DNA,
known as "amplification" of the target DNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has proven to be a
phenomenal success for genetic analysis, largely because it is
simple and very versatile, and requires relatively low cost
instrumentation. A key to this success is the concept of
thermal cycling: alternating steps of melting DNA, annealing
short primers to the resulting single strands, and extending
those primers to make new copies of the double stranded DNA.The methodology of the polymerase chain reaction is more
fully described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,202 and 4,683,195.The polymerase chain reaction (hereafter PCR) has been
performed in disposable reaction tubes such as small, plastic
microcentrifuge tubes or test tubes which are placed in an
instrument containing a thermally controlled heat exchanger.
Examples of these instruments are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
5,038,852, and in the European Patent EP-A-0236069.The heat exchanger in these instruments is typically a
metal block; however, hot air ovens and water baths also have
been used. The temperature of the reaction mixture in the
reaction tubes is changed in a cyclical fashion to cause
denaturation, annealing and extension reactions
