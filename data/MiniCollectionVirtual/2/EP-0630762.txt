<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a writing 
instrument, particularly a ball pen, composed by 
three parts only: a conventional writing tip or 
refill, an outer hollow body and a unit that is 
advantageously obtained in one piece and comprises a 
clip, a spring and a relevant push button. It is an object of the invention to cut down to 
a minimum the number of parts forming a writing 
instrument, by employing an inexpensive material, 
such as plastic, to form a unit capable of carrying 
out operations that are usually distributed to 
several components. It is another objet of the invention to provide 
a pen constituted by few components having a simple 
structure and easy to assemble. The above and other objects, that will be more 
apparent hereinafter, are attained according to the 
invention by a writing instrument comprising a 
conventional writing tip, a tubular hollow body 
slidably accommodating a push button for extracting 
the writing tip and provided with a return spring,  
 
and an outer clip, characterised in that the push 
button, the spring and the clip are obtained in a 
whole piece as a unit. The substantial characteristics of two 
preferred but not limiting embodiments of the 
writing instrument according to the invention are 
described hereinafter with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1is a side elevation view of one of the 
components of a pen according to the 
invention; Fig. 2is a view of the component of Fig. 1 looking 
in the direction of arrow A of Fig. 1; Fig. 3shows the cylindrical outer body of a writing 
instrument which is for coupling to the 
component of Figs. 1 and 2; Figs. 4 and 5are two longitudinal cross section 
views of the writing instrument in an 
operative and unactuated arrangement, 
respectively; and Figs. 6 and 7are two longitudinal cross section 
views of two distinct operational 
arrangements of a different embodiment of 
a writing instrument according to the 
present invention. Referring initially to Figs. 1 and 2, numeral 
10 indicates overall a unit comprising a push 
button, a spring and a clip. According to the 
invention, the unit 10 is constituted by a single 
piece obtained in a plastic material, preferably 
through pressing. The unit 10 is designed to couple to a tubular 
hollow body 20, shown in Fig. 3, that forms the main 
outer body of the writing instrument. The latter is 
further provided with an interchangeable refill, if 
the writing instrument is a ball pen, or another 
writing means such as a lead, if it is a propelling
