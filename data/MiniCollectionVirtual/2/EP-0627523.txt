machine, whose twin-wire zone (B-C) comprises a 

combination of the following web-forming and dewatering 
units (a)...(d), which are placed in the 

given sequence in the running direction of the web 
(W) that is formed:

side, by one of the wires (10;20), which runs over 

the open face (11';21') of the first forming roll 
(11;21), and by the substantially straight run of the 

opposite wire (20;10), starting from its guide roll 
(21A;11A) to the next forming member (22;12);

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a gap former in a paper machine, comprising the loop of a 
carrying wire and the loop of a covering wire, which together form a twin-wire 
zone, which starts from the forming gap, into which the slice part of the headbox 
feeds the pulp suspension jet, and after which twin-wire zone the web is separated 
from the covering wire and is transferred on the carrying wire onto a pick-up fabric. With increased running speeds of paper machines, several problems in the web 
formation have been manifested with increased emphasis. In the former section of a 
paper machine, the phenomena that act upon the fibre mesh and upon the water, 
which is still relatively free in connection with the fibre mesh, such as centrifugal 
forces, are, as a rule, increased in proportion to the second power of the web speed. 
The highest web speeds of existing newsprint machines are of an order of 1500 
metres per minute. However, newsprint machines are being planned in which a web 
speed of up to about 2000 m/min is aimed at. The object of the present invention is further development of the formers described 
in the applicant's FI Patent Application 751774 (equiv. to US Pat. 3,996,068) and 
FI Patent Applications 851650, 852662, and 902283, which formers are marketed by 
the applicant under the trade mark "Speed-Former". The "Speed-Former" formers 
can be characterized as gap-roll-shoe formers. In said "Speed-Former" former, need 
of further development has been noticed in particular in the case of papers made of 
slowly draining pulp qualities, such as SC-paper, and with particularly high machine 
speeds. In view of satisfying said need of development so that a sufficiently high dry 
solids content after the wire part can be guaranteed with all web grades and web 
speeds in use, the former has been developed that is described in the applicant's said 
FI Pat. Appl. 902283, in whose gap-roll-shoe-roll former a considerable proportion 
of dewatering is carried out on the last (second) forming roll, in connection with 
which roll the necessary dewatering equipment is fitted so that, on the last forming 
roll, the dry solids content of the web is still raised by about 3...5 per cent.  With respect to the prior art related to the present invention, reference is also made 
to the US Patent No. 4,769,11 of Messrs. A. Ahlstrom Corporation, to the 
applicant's FI Pat. Appl. No. 885609, as well as to the FI Pat. Appls. Nos. 885606 
and 885607 of Messrs. Valmet-Ahlstrom Inc., in which formers marketed under the 
trade
