<ABSTRACT>
A plastic conveyor belt (10), formed of plastic modules (12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22) having rows of first and second projections (24, 26) extending in opposite directions, is adapted to optionally receive one or more rollers (42) for reducing backline pressure on the belt. The rollers (42) are positioned directly on the connecting rods (28) which extend transversely through the belt, by occupying positions where projections in a row of projections would otherwise occur. A module having one or more of such openings or voids (40) may be a part of a set of component modules, some having voids (40) for receiving rollers (42) and some not having such voids (40). A belt (10) may be formed of mixtures of such modules, with or without rollers (42) on the belt. In one preffered embodiment the modules are for a radius type conveyor, with the second projections (26) having elongated slotted openings (30) to allow the modules to angularly collapse together at curves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to plastic conveyor belts, typically used in the food industry. More specifically the invention is concerned with belts made up of plastic interdigited modules connected by transverse rods, and with an improvement whereby the modules or some of the modules can be readily converted to support rollers in order to reduce back pressure of items carried on the conveyor.Examples of plastic conveyor belts having interdigited modules are shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,742,907, 4,949,838 and 4,993,554, as well, as in Application Serial No. 594,623 referenced above. Accumulation-type or low back pressure-type conveyors are shown in Patents Nos. 4,231,469. 4,821,869 and 4,909,380. The referenced '469 patent shows a low back pressure-type conveyor having connecting rods which secure the modules together and also serve to support rollers positioned at spaced locations on the rods. However, unlike the belt system of the present invention, in that patent (Figure 7) the projections from module to module were not interdigited in alternating arrangement but instead had a pair of projections from one module positioned between a wider-spaced pair of projections from the next module. A roller was then positioned between the inner ones of these four projections. In addition, the accumulating belt of that patent was not capable of travel around curves, as opposed to one embodiment of the present invention. The referenced '907 patent is directed to a radius-type conveyor and in the context of a radius-type conveyer discloses the features of the precharacterising part of claims 1It is a primary purpose of the present invention to provide a modular plastic conveyor belt system wherein accumulation rollers can be easily added at selected positions in situations where low back pressure is desired, supported by the connecting rods, and without modifying the basic modules or affecting the integrity of the conveyor belt.The invention is characterised by the features of independent claims 1, and 10.The plastic modules and belt system of this invention enable the inclusion of a limited number of low back pressure rollers in the conveyor belt assembly, supported by the connecting rods themselves, without changing the structure of the modules. In one embodiment, the belt and modules of the invention are of the radius type, with slotted rod holes in one set of projections on each module to enable travel either straight or around curves. In another embodiment this feature is incorporated in a belt capable of

<CLAIMS>
A modular plastic conveyor belt (10) including a series of connected elongated molded plastic belt module rows each including one or more belt modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) in the row, the belt module rows being connected by rods (28) extending transversely to the length of the conveyor belt (10), each belt module row having a plurality of first spaced projections (24) generally in a pattern of regular spacings extending in one direction from the row and a plurality of second spaced projections (26) generally in a pattern of regular spacings extending in an opposite direction from the row, the first (24) and second (26) projections of serially adjacent module rows (12,14,16,18,19, 20, 22) being longitudinally overlapping and juxtaposed when the modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) are connected serially in the conveyor belt (10) by the connecting rods (28) extending through transverse openings in the projections,
characterised in that

at least some of the plastic modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) having projections removed at locations where rollers (40) are to be installed so as to provide spaces (40), so that in the assembled conveyor belt made up of plastic modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) with the first (24) and second (26) projections overlapping and juxtaposed, the connecting rod (28) extends at said spaces (40) between projections (24) of one module row without passing through a projection (26) of an adjacent module row, with a backline pressure reducing roller (42) positioned on the connecting rod (28) in some of the spaces (40) so that the conveyor belt also serves as a low backline pressure conveyor belt.
A conveyor belt as claim in claim 1, wherein rollers (42) for reducing backline pressure are positioned on connecting rods (28) in said spaces (40).
A conveyor belt as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the belt width is made up of plural staggered modules (14,19,20), with serially alternating module rows having different numbers of laterally aligned modules making up the width of the belt.
A conveyor belt as claimed in any of claim 1-3, wherein the belt is a radius-type conveyor belt, with the second projections (26) of each module row having slotted openings to accommodate angular collapse of the belt for travel around curves.
A conveyor belt as claimed in claim 4, said spaces (40) being in the positions of said second slotted projections (30).
A conveyor belt as claimed in any of claims 1-5 wherein the overlapping projections (24, 26) of adjacent modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) are interdigited and alternating.
A conveyor belt as claimed in claim 6, wherein the first and second projections (24, 26) of a module (12 or 18) are arranged generally in staggered relationship with each other.
A conveyor belt as claimed in any of claims 1-7, including belt modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) with spaces (40) at differing locations.

removing one or more projections from one or more rows of first projections (24) or second projections (26) of the modules (12,14,16,18,19,20,22) to form a space or void (40) where said projections have been removed, and
