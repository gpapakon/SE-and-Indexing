<ABSTRACT>
A coolant feeder in a tool holder assembly which comprises a 
rotary shaft (10) mounted to the spindle of a machine tool and 

a stationary support member (11) rotatably supporting the said 
rotary shaft (10) in which the stationary coolant feeding ring 

(13) in communication with the radial passage for the tool (12) 
provided on the rotary shaft (10) axially is fitted over the 

rotary shaft (10) adjacent to the said stationary support 
member (11) and the stationary coolant feeding ring (13) and 

the coolant coupling device (14) on the machine tool side are 
connected with the coolant pipe (15) and the hollow (16) of the 

said coolant coupling device (14) is allowed to be in 
communication with the annular groove (17) of the stationary 

coolant feeding ring (13) via the radial passage (18) of the 
said coolant pipe (15) and only removing the stationary coolant 

feeding ring (13) from the rotary shaft (10) enables repairing 
of a series of coolant passages to the tool to be installed to 

the rotary shaft without removing the stationary support member

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
coolant feeder in combination with a
tool holder assembly
according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.The rotating cutting tool with an oil hole has
features to cool and lubricate the cutting edge by machining
the workpiece while injecting coolant fed to the oil
hole through the cutting edge and extend the service life
of the cutting tools as well as improve the finished work
surface.The conventional oil feeder in the tool holder of
this type has a stationary support member 3 which rotatably
supports the rotary shaft 1 as shown in Fig.14 built
integral with a coolant passage connector later discussed
which can be attached and removed to and from the coolant
feeding base on the machine tool side, thereby allowing
coolant to flow in the coolant feeding passage for tools 
formed in the rotary shaft via each coolant passage of the
connector thereof and stationary support member 3, and
feeds coolant to the oil hole of the tools through the
said coolant passage.In this event, because a coolant feeding passage is
formed across the relative interface 8 between the stationary
support member 3 at rest and the rotary shaft 1 in
rotation, oiltight rings 5 are designed to be intermediately
mounted between the two to prevent coolant leakage
from the interface.However, over a long period of service, cutting chips
entering from the outside or contained in the coolant are
entrained between the oiltight ring 5 and the circumferential
surface of the rotating surface 1 which is brought
rotatably in contact with the oiltight ring 5 through the
said relative interface, and form a dent resulting from
sliding frictional resistance of cutting chips, etc. on
the circumferential surface of the rotary shaft in contact
with the oiltight ring 5 as shown in an alternate long and
two short dashes line H in Fig. 14, break oiltightness
achieved by the oiltight rings and cause the coolant to
leak from the dent, which enters bearings 2, 2 located
with the coolant feeding passage set inbetween, and frequently
causes accidents of damaging the said bearings 
2,2.In order to prevent this problem, in the past, the
applicant of the present invention designed to intermediately
install a replaceable sleeve 4 between both bearings
2, 2 located between the rotary shaft 1 and the stationary
support member 3 rotatably supporting the said rotary
shaft 1 via a pair of bearings 2, 2, as well as to intermediately
support the oiltight ring 5 between the
stationary support member 3 and the sleeve 4 as shown in
Fi
