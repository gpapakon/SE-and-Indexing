<ABSTRACT>
In a communication system having at least one physical channel shared by a plurality of time divided users (21, 22), a method is provided of dynamically adjusting a maximum number of users allowed access to the at least one physical channel. The method includes the steps of calculating a voice activity factor of each user of the plurality of time divided users (21, 22) and adjusting the maximum number of users based upon the calculated voice activity factors. An apparatus is provided for implementing the described method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention relates to communication
systems and more specifically trunked communication
systems.Time assigned speech interpolation (TASI) and
digital speech interpolation (DSI) techniques are often
used within public switched telephone networks (PSTNs)
where speech signals must be exchanged between two or
more points (switching centers) over a limited number of
grouped physical channels (e.g., over T1 lines). Where
high capacity T1 span lines are used the number of lines
needed is determined by dividing an estimate of the total
number of traffic channels needed at a switching center by
the number (N) traffic channel provided per T1 line.In some PSTNs each traffic channel of the N traffic
channels per T1 line is allocated to a call for the duration
of the call. While such a technique may produce reliable
telephone service of good quality, such technique is
wasteful. The technique is wasteful because normal
speech is often punctuated by pauses between sentences
or between words within a sentence. Such pauses causes
the traffic channel to remain idle during the pause instead
of transmitting voice information.To reduce the waste associated with idle traffic
channels, a TASI or DSI (TASI/DSI) system limits
allocation of traffic channels to periods between pauses
(where information is available for transmission). Where
a pause occurs during speech, the channel is released for
use by another user. When speech resumes the next 
available channel is allocated in support of the conversation.US-A-4831373 describes a method for dynamically allocating data
channels on a trunked communications system whereby channels are divided
between data channels and voice channels and if activity in either type of
channels exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the system re-allocates a
channel from one type to another.EP-A-0407367 discloses an arrangement for dynamically allocating timeslots
to connections on radio channels in a mobile radio system. Such
allocation is dependent upon speech activity on the connections.Key to the successful operation of a TASI/DSI system is determination,
during set-up of the system, of an accurate estimate of an average voice activity
factor (VAF) of a set of grouped physical channels. A VAF is an estimate of the
ratio of speech time to the sum of speech plus pauses. VAFs are typically
estimated by system designers because of the difficulty of measuring individual
voice channels and of obtaining an average of a channel group.The VAF is used by the TASI/DSI system as a measure of the

one physical channel, such method comprising the steps of:
determining a voice activity factor based upon a vocoder activity, of each user of

a number of users (21, 22) operating on the at least one physical channel of the
plurality of users within the communication system; determining a maximum

number of users to be allowed on the at least one physical channel based upon
the determined voice activity factors; and when the number of the users

operating on the at least one physical channel exceeds the determined
maximum number of users, denying access to a user of the plurality of users

requesting access to the physical channel.

a user of the plurality of users when the number of users operating on the at

least one physical channel does not exceed the calculated maximum number of
users.

number of users of the at least one physical channel based upon the

determined voice activity factors further includes the step of averaging the
determined voice activity factors.
