<ABSTRACT>
An active heater control circuit (14) for a deicing
heater (12) on a probe 10 mounted on an aircraft 13,

such as a pitot pressure sensing probe, a pitot-static
pressure sensing probe, a total air temperature sensor, or

engine inlet probe, controls power to the heater (12)
through a switch (18). When activated the switch (18)

sends electrical power to the heater until the probe
temperature reaches a desired set point. A feature of the

invention is an override pulse (48, 48A-48F), which
independently activates the switch (18) to provide power

to the heater (12) at a selected period and duty cycle
such that the aircraft current monitoring circuit (15)

receives current sufficiently often to avoid triggering a
false heater failure alarm even when the probe temperature

has reached its control set point. This feature allows the
use of probes (10) incorporating active heat control

circuits (14) on existing aircraft (13) configured for
older probes (10) having simple nickel-based resistive

heater control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active
heater control that is used in connection with aerospace
probes that sense environmental parameters, such as pitot
or pitot-static tubes, fuselage mounted total air
temperature sensors, and engine inlet air temperature
sensors, which all employ heaters to keep the probes free
of icing during aircraft operation. The heaters usually
are on continuously in flight, and during selected periods
of time on the ground. The active heater control circuit
of the present invention reduces heater power during
conditions of low mass air flow thereby avoiding heater or
probe damage or other performance problems.In the prior art, traditional de-icing heaters
on probes, such as pitot, pitot-static, total air
temperature and engine inlet temperature sensor probes
employ nickel-based resistors that rely on the rise in
electrical resistance with temperature exhibited by nickel
to reduce current load. Heaters of this type provide only
rudimentary temperature control when power is applied in
the form of a constant voltage because the change in
resistance of nickel with temperature is not large. As a
consequence, probe temperatures often become excessive
when convection cooling is poor, that is, when the air
mass moving over the probe is low, such as when an
aircraft is on the ground, either stationary or taxiing.
Excessive probe temperatures can result at that time,
causing reduced reliability of the heating element.
Excessive probe temperatures also cause severe thermal
stresses in the sensor assembly leading to various failure
modes. In the case of total air temperature probes,
excessive temperatures increase errors in the total air 
temperature measurement, referred to as the de-icing
heater error or DHE.Active heater controllers (AHCs) using
semiconductor switches such as power MOSFETs, transistors,
triacs, and SCRs are often utilized as switches to control
power to resistive heating elements. A major impediment to
the use of such active devices on aerospace probes is
their incompatibility with existing aircraft systems. The
problem lies with the aircraft current monitoring
circuitry which expects relatively high, substantially
continuous current levels typical of existing probes. An
AHC will pulse the current in the form of regular on/off
cycles in order to achieve temperature control. On/off
cycling is desirable because it reduces power dissipation
in the active device. It is preferable to have the active
device, or switch, either fully "on" or "off" as opposed
to an
