<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic control device (10) with directional valve (11) in LS technology with individual pressure balance (12) and secondary pressure-relief valve (44) is proposed, in which both motor connections (24, 25) can be protected with different pressure values although the load pressure is picked off upstream of a distributor point of the pressure-medium flow to the two motor connections (24, 25). Allocated to the pressure-relief valve (44) is an adjusting unit (67) whose pressure space (69), as a function of the deflection of the control spool (15), can be loaded with a pressure signal, and, as a function of this, a piston (71) changes the response pressure of the pressure-relief valve. The pick-off of the pressure signal is controlled directly by the control spool (15) of the directional valve (11).

Hydraulic control device with a directional valve
(11) which is suitable for controlling an engine and is

intended for control independent of load pressure and the
control slide (15) of which, working as a measuring

diaphragm, in a neutral position shuts off at least one
conduit leading to the engine and in two working positions

connects the said conduit alternately to an inflow
or a return, and with a pressure balance (12) which is

connected upstream of the directional valve (11) and in
series with the measuring diaphragm of the latter and the

regulating member of which can be actuated by a spring
counter to a pressure difference composed of the pressure

upstream of the measuring diaphragm at the load pressure,
the load pressure acting in a control chamber (56) which

is connected to the downstream side of the measuring
diaphragm and to a load-pressure pick-up point, in which

control device the control chamber is protected by a
pressure relief valve (44), in order to limit the pressure

downstream of the directional valve to a predetermined
value by means of the pressure balance (12), and in

which directional valve (11) the load-pressure pick-up
point is located upstream of the point of distribution of

the pressure-medium stream to the two engine connections

(24, 25), characterized in that hydraulically adjustable
actuating means (67, 91) are provided for changing the

response pressure of the pressure relief valve (44), and
in that at least one control duct (73, 74, 77, 79) leads

into a pressure space (69) of these actuating means (67,
91), a connection in the said control duct to an engine 

connection (24) being capable of being controlled directly
by the control slide (15) of the directional valve

(11).
Control device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the control duct (73, 74, 77, 79) opens into

a portion of the slide bore (16) which is capable of
being overrun by a piston portion (32) of the control

slide (15).
Control device according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the portion of the slide bore (16) is

located between an inflow chamber (19) connected downstream
of the measuring diaphragm (14) and an adjoining

engine chamber (18, 20).
Control device according to one or more of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the actuating means (67;

91) have a piston (71, 92) which is capable of being
subjected to the pressure in the pressure space (69) and

by means of which a closing member (58) of the pressure
relief valve (44) is capable of being loaded in addition

to the compression spring (59).
Control device according to one or more of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the actuating means (91)

have a piston (92) which is capable of being subjected to
the pressure in the pressure space (69) and is adjustable

against a stop (93) fixed to the housing and by means of
which the prestress of the spring (59) in the pressure

relief valve (44) is capable of being adjusted.
Control device according to one or more of Claims
1 to 5, characterized in that, when the control bore (77,

78) is in the state overlapped by the control slide (15),
the pressure in the pressure space (69) is relieved to

the tank itself through the guide gap of the piston (71,
92).
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the control duct (73, 74, 77, 79)

has at least two intersecting control bores (77, 74)
which run perpendicularly to one another and which start

from an underside (76) and an end face (37) of the
housing (13), and in that the control bore (77) starting 

from the underside (76) is connected to the slide bore
(16) via a control bore (79) made by a flange face (64)

and resembling a blind hole.
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the actuating means (67, 91) are

arranged essentially in an actuating housing (72) which
is mounted on one end face (37) of the directional-valve

housing (13), on which a restoring device (38) for the
control slide (15) is also arranged.
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the pressure balance (12), the

pressure relief valve (44) and the actuating unit (67,
91) are arranged coaxially in the housing (13).
Control device according to one or more of Claims

system pressure balance is provided in the region of the
load-pressure pick-up (53) for the individual pressure

balance (12) between the measuring diaphragm (14) and
inflow chamber (19).
