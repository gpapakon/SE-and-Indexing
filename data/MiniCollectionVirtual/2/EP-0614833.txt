<ABSTRACT>
The articles, such as boxes of confectionery products, 
which initially advance on a p
lurality of paths which are 
parallel to one another (L1, ..., L10) are firstly ordered 

in rows such that they slide on a surface of a plate (2) 
under the action of motor-driven entrainment strips or blades 

(5). When they pass onto a conveyor (8) acting in a direction 
transverse the general direction of advance of the 

articles (A) on the plate (2), the rows are compacted by 
urging the articles (A) against a side restraint plate (7). 

The articles (A) can then be withdrawn from the compact 
rows in a predetermined number when the rows themselves 

pass in correspondence with further motor-driven conveyors 
(10) which act in a direction transverse to the general 

entrainment line of the articles (A). The withdrawal 
operation can be repeated several times, when the rows have 

been compacted in the interim, urging the articles against 
the side plate (7) again.

 
A preferred application in automatic packaging machines for 

food products, such as confectionery products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for conveying 
articles supplied in respective flow lines adjacent to one 
another. The invention has been developed with particular attention 
to the possible use in the field of plants for automatically 
packaging products, such as food products, for example 
confectionery products. Within the context of this application, the problem of sorting 
the flow of articles coming from respective source 
stations to subsequent processing stations located downstream 
in the direction of flow of the articles occurs relatively 
frequently. Exemplary of that art are documents such as 
DD-A-90511, DE-A-2 161 618, US-A-2 833 393, DE-A-1 943 085, EP-A-0 335 639. 
For example, the source stations can 
be packaging machines in which products such as snacks, 
biscuits, etc., packaged in flexible wrappers (flow-packs), 
are inserted in groups in respective boxes. The further 
processing stations can, for example, be wrapping machines 
in which each box is in turn inserted in a further wrapping 
in the form of a flexible wrapper of the flow-pack type. Within the context of this application, a number of problems 
arise of which account must be taken. Firstly, the source stations (for example, the boxing machines) 
usually supply a conveying line with parallel rows. 
Each source machine supplies a respective row with a flow 
of articles which, although it is substantially constant, 
is not completely continuous, owing to the various reasons: 
for example, temporary stoppages of the source station because 
of a lack of packaging material, discharge of defective 
articles upstream or downstream of the source station,  
 
etc.. Secondly, the number of source stations and thus of the parallel 
rows of the flow of articles generated thereby is 
generally different from the number of processing stations 
provided downstream. For example, it is possible to envisage 
ten source stations (for example, ten boxing machines) 
downstream of which there are only two wrapping machines, 
or four wrapping machines of which two are intended to operate 
continuously whilst the other two are used to take account 
of possible interruptions in the operation of the 
other wrapping machines or of incidents occurring in the 
flow of articles to be packaged. It is generally known to overcome the above problems by resorting 
to a so-called accumulation (or "store") function, 
that is, by providing for a certain amassing of articles 
(the so-called accumulation or store) between the outlets 
of the source
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for conveying articles (A) supplied in respective 
flow lines (L1, ..., L10) adjacent one another, 

comprising the steps of: 

transfering on a conveyor the articles (A) advancing along the flow 
lines (L1, ... L10), 
forming respective rows of articles from the articles (A) advancing along the flow lines 
(L1, ..., L10), each row 

consisting of articles (A) aligned in a direction transverse 
the flow lines (L1 ..., L10), 
moving the articles (A) in each row towards one another 
so as to form compact rows consisting of articles (A) 

in contact with each other, and 
withdrawing (10) a predetermined number (
n
) of articles 
(A) from each compact row; this withdrawal being effected 

by virtue of a translation of the predetermined number 
(
n
) of articles in a direction transverse the direction of 
advance of the rows. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the rows or articles (A) are footed by supplying the articles 

(A) onto a sliding surface (2), thus providing movable 
alignment means (5) which act on the articles (A) and cause 

them to slide on the sliding surface (2) so as to bring the 
articles (A) into alignment in a row consisting of articles 

(A) in contact with the alignment means (5). 
A process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised 
in that the rows are formed by acting, at least temporarily, 

on the articles (A) with means (6) for decelerating 
the movement. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the moving towards one another of the articles (A) 

in each row is effected by conveying (8) the articles towards an 
abutment surface (7) which is 

substantially adjacent and aligned with the direction of  
 

advance of the rows and thus favours a compacting sliding movement of 
the articles (A) towards the abutment surface (7). 
A process according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
it comprises providing an aperture (7a) in 

the abutment surface (7) for the passage of the articles 
(A) withdrawn in correspondence with the position in which 

the predetermined number of articles (A) are taken up. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises the operation of 

withdrawing articles (A) in a plurality of positions of the 
general advancing movement of the rows, and in that, between the successive 

withdrawal positions, a further operation for compacting 
the articles (A) towards one another in a row is provided. 
A device for conveying articles (A) supplied in respective 
adjacent flow lines (L1, ..., L10), 

comprising: 

alignment means (5, 6) for forming respective rows of said articles 
(A) from the articles (A) advancing along the flow lines 

(L1, ..., L10), each row consisting of said articles (A) aligned 
in a transverse direction relative to the flow lines (L1, 

...L10), 
an abutment surface (7) which is substantially adjacent and 
aligned with the direction of advance of the rows, 
conveyor means (8) for moving the articles (A) in each 
row towards said abutment surface (7) so as to form compact rows 

formed by articles (A) in contact with each another, and 
further conveyor means (11) for withdrawing (10) a 
predetermined number (
n
) of articles (A) from each compact 
row; the further conveyor means being arranged so as to effect 

a translation of the predetermined number (
n
) of articles 
in a transverse direction relative to the direction of 

advance of the rows. 
A device according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
it comprises a sliding surface (2) onto which the articles (A) 

are supplied from the flow lines (L1, ... L10) as well as 
motor-driven (3) alignment means (5) which produce the 

sliding movement of the articles (A) on the sliding surface 
(2) so as to bring the articles (A) into alignment in a row 

consisting of articles in contact with the alignment means 
(5). 
A device according to Claim 7 or Claim 8, characterised 
in that it comprises means (6) for decelerating the movement 

with which means the articles (A) cooperate, at 
least temporarily, in order to form the rows. 
A device according to any one of Claims 7 to 9, characterised 
in that it comprises an abutment surface (7) 

which is substantially adjacent and aligned with the direction 
of advance of the rows and conveyor means (8) for producing 

a sliding movement of the articles (A) towards the 
abutment surface (7). 
A device according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
the abutment surface (7) has an aperture (7a) for the passage 

of the articles withdrawn in correspondence with the 
further conveyor means.

means (11), respective conveyor means (8) being interposed 
between the further conveyor means (11) of the 

plurality for compacting towards the abutment surface (7) the 
rows of articles (A) between two successive withdrawal operations.
