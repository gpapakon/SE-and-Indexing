<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A CARBONATE COMPOSITIONTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to a process for making a carbonate composition, particularly a slurry of fine calcium carbonate particles suitable for use primarily in paper filling and coating, and also in non-paper areas such as rubber and plastics, paints and textiles.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A known caustic soda (NaOH) manufacturing process is carried out by reacting dissolved soda ash (Na2C03) with hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) to produce caustic soda and a precipitated calcium carbonate byproduct. The reaction occurs in an aqueous slurry at a dilute concentration, generally 10%. The reaction mechanism for the lime-soda process is:Ca(OH)2 + Na2C03 â†’ 2NaOH + CaC03 See Hultman et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,311,666, issuedJanuary 19, 1982. The reaction temperature and residence time are adjusted to maximize the NaOH yield. Soda ash is available from a variety of sources, and may be recovered from aqueous sodium carbonate solutions by a method involving evaporation and centrifugation as described in Copenhafer et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,519,806, issued May 28, 1985.Calcium carbonate is used in the paper industry for paper filling and coating applications in the form of a slurry of fine calcium carbonate particles in water, with other known additives. See, for example, the calcium 

 carbonate pigment described in Japanese Patent No. 82- 30814. It is known to use a neutralized copoly er of ( eth)acrylic acid and aleic or fumaric acid as a stabilizer in such a composition; see Japanese Patent Publication 53144499 (1978).Calcium carbonate is both mined and made synthetically by a variety of well known processes. See, for example, Heytmeijer et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,100,264, issued July 11, 1978, wherein calcium carbonate is produced from calcium chloride, and Faatz U.S. Patent No. 4,272,498, issued June 9, 1981, which discloses a method of making a fine calcium carbonate slurry by reaction with carbon dioxide. Pettersson U.S. Patent No. 4,941,945, issued July 17, 1990, concerns a method of precipitating calcium carbonate by treatment of green liquor with caustic lime. Japanese Patent Publication 62-171921 produces a fine calcium carbonate suitable for use a paper filler by use of a gas-liquid plane contact reactor. Other processes have been proposed for recovering calcium carbonate produced by the lime-soda reaction and other reactions in cake form. See Japanese Patent Publication 73-9720 (also recovering NaOH) , and Soviet Union Patent Publication Nos. 490,755,
