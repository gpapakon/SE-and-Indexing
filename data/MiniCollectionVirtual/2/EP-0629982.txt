<ABSTRACT>
A frequency-dividing transponder for detecting electromagnetic radiation of a first 
predetermined frequency and responding to said detection by transmitting electromagnetic 

radiation of a second predetermined frequency that is a frequency-divided quotient of the 
first predetermined frequency, includes an active strip (10, 30, 52) of amorphous magnetic 

material having a transverse uniaxial anisotropy defining a magnetomechanical resonant 
frequency in accordance with the dimensions of the strip at the second predetermined 

frequency when magnetically biased to be within a predetermined magnetic field intensity 
range so as to respond to excitation by electromagnetic radiation of the first 

predetermined frequency by transmitting electromagnetic radiation of the second 
predetermined frequency; and a tripole strip (12, 32, 54) of magnetic material of such 

coercivity and so disposed in relation to the active strip of magnetic material as to create a 
magnetomechanical resonance in the active strip at the first predetermined frequency when 

the active strip is magnetically biased to be within the predetermined magnetic field 
intensity range. The transponder is used as a component of a tag (14, 28, 48) that is 

attached to an article to be detected within a surveillance zone of a presence detection 
system, such as an electronic article surveillance (EAS) system utilized for theft 

deterrence. The transponder may also include a bipolar bias strip (50) of such coercivity 
and so disposed in relation to the active strip as to cause the active strip to be within the 

predetermined magnetic field intensity range at which the active strip has 
magnetomechanical resonance at the first and second predetermined frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to frequency-dividing transponders of the 
type that detects electromagnetic radiation of a first predetermined frequency and 
responds to said detection by transmitting electromagnetic radiation of a second 
predetermined frequency that is a frequency-divided quotient of the first predetermined 
frequency. The present invention is particularly directed to improving the efficiency of 
initiating frequency division in such type of frequency-dividing transponder that includes 
an active strip of amorphous magnetic material having a transverse uniaxial anisotropy 
defining a magnetomechanical resonant frequency in accordance with the dimensions of 
the strip at the second predetermined frequency when magnetically biased to be within a 
predetermined magnetic field intensity range so as to respond to excitation by 
electromagnetic radiation of the first predetermined frequency by transmitting 
electromagnetic radiation of the second predetermined frequency, as described in United 
States Patent No. 4,727,360 to Lucian G. Ferguson and Lincoln H. Charlot, Jr. The 
transponder described in said Patent further includes a bipolar bias strip of magnetic 
material of such coercivity and so disposed in relation to the active strip of magnetic 
material as to cause the active strip of magnetic material to be within the predetermined 
magnetic field intensity range. The transponder is used as a component of a tag that is 
attached to an article to be detected within a surveillance zone of a presence detection 
system, such as an electronic article surveillance (EAS) system utilized for theft 
deterrence. The presence detection system further includes means for transmitting 
electromagnetic radiation of a first predetermined frequency into a surveillance zone and 
means for detecting electromagnetic radiation of the second predetermined frequency 
within the surveillance zone. The present invention provides a frequency-dividing transponder for detecting  
 
electromagnetic radiation of a first predetermined frequency and responding to said 
detection by transmitting electromagnetic radiation of a second predetermined frequency 
that is a frequency-divided quotient of the first predetermined frequency, comprising an 
active strip of amorphous magnetic material having a transverse uniaxial anisotropy 
defining a magnetomechanical resonant frequency in accordance with the dimensions of
