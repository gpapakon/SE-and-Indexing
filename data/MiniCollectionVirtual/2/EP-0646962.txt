<ABSTRACT>
An object of this invention 
is to provide a metal sheet processing 

method and a lead frame processing 
method which are capable of processing 

a work to an excellent shape 
finely with a high dimensional accuracy 

without being influenced by 
heat input due to the irradiation of a 

laser beam. According to the present 
invention, a metal sheet (101) is 

coated at both surfaces thereof with 
photoresist films (1) first, and a laser 

beam (202) is then applied to the 
metal sheet (101) through the outer 

surface of the photoresist film (1) so 
as to form a plurality of discontinuous 

through bores (3) in rows with 
joint portions (6) as unprocessed portions 

left among the through bores 
(3). The opened portions (2) formed 

by the laser beam processing of the 
photoresist film (1) extend continuously 

to serve as an etching pattern. 
The surrounding wall portions (6) 

are then subjected to etching to remove 
the same and connect together 

the through bores (3) formed in rows, 
whereby clearances (303a) of a predetermined 

shape are formed. Instead 
of forming the through bores 

(3) and joint portions (6) in the metal 
sheet (101), the steps of forming non-through bores (51) in the metal sheet (101) with joint portions (52) left as unprocessed 

portions in their bottoms, and then subjecting the resultant product to etching may be taken.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal plate processing
method capable of finely processing metal plates
into a satisfactory configuration, a method of processing
lead frames utilizing the metal plate processing method,
and a method of manufacturing semiconductor
devices using such lead frames.Lead frames comprise metal plates in which fine patterns
such as inner leads and outer leads are processed.
After mounting a semiconductor chip on the lead frame,
terminals of the semiconductor chip and the inner leads are
electrically connected to each other.Recently, there has been an even stronger demand for a
higher packing density and higher integration of semiconductor
chips. Corresponding to the demand, lead frames for
mounting semiconductor chips thereon have also been developed
which are of fine shapes and highly accurate dimensions. 
In particular, great weight has been given to increasing
the number of pins per lead frame. With an increase
in the number of pins per lead frame, a processing
technique is required which can process distal end portions
of inner leads to be smaller in pitch and finer in shape.Conventional techniques for forming such lead frames
having a number of pins and a narrow pitch from metal
plates has been primarily practiced by a process utilizing
chemical corrosion, particularly wet etching using an
etchant (hereinafter referred to simply as etching). By
that conventional processing method, lead frames having
satisfactory fine configurations can be easily processed.Meanwhile, there is also known a method of processing
metal plates, particularly lead frames, in combination of
etching and laser cutting as disclosed in JP-A-3-123063 or DE-A-4 103 834 and
JP-A-4-37493. The processing method disclosed in the
former JP-A-3-123063 or DE-A-4 103 834 comprises cutting the portions having
a narrow pitch, such as inner leads, by irradiation of a
laser beam, and processing the portions having a not so
narrow pitch, such as outer leads, by punching or etching.
The processing method disclosed in the latter JP-A-4-37493
comprises etching a part of the total amount which is to be
processed in the direction of plate thickness to form a
recess having a curved inner surface, and then post-cutting
the remaining part, which has been left not penetrated by
the etching, by irradiation of a laser beam so that the
remaining part is thoroughly penetrated to form inner leads 
having a narrow pitch.The laser cutting employed in the above methods is
suitable for fine processing because a laser beam can be
cond
