<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic touch position sensor (16) is shown in which a transducer (18) coupled to a side of a substrate (10) imparts a shear wave (12) into the substrate for propagation along a first axis. A reflective array (28) is disposed along the first axis to reflect portions of the shear wave along a plurality of parallel paths extending across a touch surface (40) of the substrate to a second reflective array (30) the axis of which is parallel to the axis of the first reflective array. The second reflective array reflects the shear waves incident thereto to a transducer (20) mounted on the side of the substrate and responsive to shear waves propagated thereto for providing a signal representative of these shear waves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acoustic
touch position sensor and more particularly to a
touch panel for use in an acoustic touch position
sensor, the touch panel suppressing spurious acoustic
waves and capable of being formed as a thin or thick
panel while supporting shear waves for propagation
therein.EP-A-0435203 describes a coordinate input
apparatus in which a plurality of vibration sensors
are arranged on a vibration transmission plate to
detect the location of a pen used to input a
vibration into the plate. A vibration-isolating
member formed in a peripheral portion of the
vibration transmission plate is constituted by a
plurality of vibration-isolating layers. A
vibration-isolating layer nearer to the vibration
transmission plate has a lower acoustic impedance
than that of a vibration-isolating layer farther from
the vibration transmission plate, thereby reducing
noise during vibration detection.Acoustic touch position sensors are known to
include a touch panel or plate having a group of
transmitters positioned along a first edge of the
panel for simultaneously generating Rayleigh waves
that propagate through the panel in a X direction to
a group of detectors positioned on a second edge of
the panel opposite to the first edge. A group of
transmitters is also positioned along a third edge of
the panel for simultaneously generating Rayleigh
waves that propagate through the panel in a Y
direction to a group of detectors positioned on a
fourth edge of the panel opposite to the third edge.
Interruption of intersecting waves by touching the
panel causes unique output signals to be developed at
a X detector and a Y detector defining the point 
of intersection. Such an acoustic touch position
sensor is shown in United States Patent No.
3,673,327.Acoustic touch position sensors are also known
wherein only two transducers per axis are required.
For each axis one transducer imparts a surface
acoustic wave that propagates along the
perpendicular axis on which a first reflective
grating is disposed to reflect portions of the
surface acoustic wave along plural parallel paths of
differing lengths to a second reflective grating.
The second reflective grating reflects the surface
acoustic waves to a second transducer where the
signals are received for processing. The reflective
gratings associated with the X axis are
perpendicular to the reflective gratings associated
with the Y axes so as to provide a grid pattern to
enable coordinates of a touch on the plate to be
determined. Acoustic touch position
