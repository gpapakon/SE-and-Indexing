is transmitted to an output shaft (46) by a plurality of gears 
(32,34,36,38,42,48) 

connected with a rotary shaft (64) of the motor while reducing 
the rotational speed. A rotational position detecting 

element (74) is coupled to the output shaft to detect rotational 
position of the output shaft. A base board (14) integratedly 

includes a gear supporting section (18) supporting at least one 
of the plurality of gears, a motor power supply terminal 

section (20) connected to the motor for supplying electricity 
thereto, a detecting element terminal section (22) connected to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base board for use
in a speed reducer or the like which drives an output shaft
by reducing rotational speed of a motor with a plurality of
gears. The present invention is also related to an actuator
having a motor that rotates an air flow adjusting damper or
the like for automobile air conditioners.In a typical air flow adjusting damper for air
conditioners for automobiles a motorized actuator apparatus
is used in order to operate the damper.An actuator apparatus of this kind is provided with a
motor arranged in a housing case. In the housing case, an
output shaft is rotatably supported in link with an air flow
adjusting damper by means of an arm. In addition a
plurality of gears are assembled so as to connect a rotary
shaft of the motor and the output shaft of the apparatus.
Further, the housing case includes a built-in electric
circuit section to be referred to as a "switch unit."As shown in Figs.16 and 17, a switch unit 110 is 
composed of a block-shaped insulator 112 made of a resin
having a metallic plate 114 heat-caulked thereto. Plate 114
is provided with brushes 116, which extend upward from the
upper surface of insulator 112 in a state where plate 114 is
fixed to insulator 112. A motor (not shown) is connected to
a power supply terminal section 118 of insulator 112 after
plate 114 is fixed thereto. Further, a plurality of connect
pins 122 are press-fit into plate 114 in a connector section
120 of insulator 112 after plate 114 is fixed to insulator
112, and the fixed connect pins are exposed outside
connector section 120. The thus arranged switch unit 110 is
accommodated in a housing case 124 which is covered by a
cover 126.In the actuator apparatus, brushes 116 and power supply
terminal section 118 are electrically connected via plate
114 to connect pins 122, which in turn are connected to an
outside control device. In this arrangement, the motor is
supplied with electricity via power supply terminal section
118 while brushes 116 detect a rotational position of an
output shaft, so that the motor is rotated under the control
of the control device. The rotational force is transmitted
through a plurality of gears so that the rotational speed is
retarded, which in turn rotates the output shaft to a
predetermined position. Thus, the air flow adjusting damper
may be moved to a predetermined rotational position. Meanwhile, the conventional motorized actuator
apparatus, as stated above, includes switch unit 110,
namely, of insulator 112, plate 114 and a plurality of
co
