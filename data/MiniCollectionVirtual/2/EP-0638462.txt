<ABSTRACT>
On the supporting foot (3) of a roof-rack (1) there is formed a vertical inserting slot (10) which extends from the lower limiting edge of the supporting foot (3) to an aperture (11) for receiving a fastening screw (6) which can be screwed into a threaded sleeve (5) which is fastened in the roof (4) of the motor vehicle. A positive-locking socket (19) is formed concentrically with the reception aperture (11), is formed by means of imprinting, is cylindrical and encloses the cylindrical screw head (8) of the fastening screw (6) in a positive manner up to the insertion slot (10, 18). The depth and/or axial extent of the positive-locking socket (19) is at least equal to the height of one turn of the fastening screw (6).

Supporting leg for a roof rack for motor vehicles with at least one location hole for 
receiving the shank of a fixing screw which can be screwed into a threaded sleeve 

provided in the motor vehicle and an entry slot for the shank of the fixing screw 
leading from an outer boundary edge of the supporting leg to the location hole, 

characterised in that a cylindrical form-fit holder (14, 17, 19, 23) with an entry slot 
(15, 18, 10) for the form-fit reception of a cylindrical part of the screw head (8) of 

the fixing screw (6) adapted to the form-fit holder at least in the region adjacent to 
the shank (7) of the fixing screw (6) is provided concentrically with the location 

hole (11). 
Supporting leg according to claim 1, characterised in that the form-fit holder (19) 
is formed by a cylindrical boss on the supporting leg (3). 
Supporting leg according to claim 2, characterised in that the raised portion (19.1) 
formed on the rear of the supporting leg (3) by the boss (19) engages in the 

assembled state in a recess (5.1) formed in the threaded sleeve (5) and adapted in a 
form-fit manner to the raised portion (19.1). 
Supporting leg according to claim 1, characterised in that the form-fit holder (14, 
17) is formed by a raised border. 
Supporting leg according to claim 4, characterised in that the raised border is 
formed by a ring (17) with an entry slot (18) fixed to the supporting leg. 
Supporting leg according to claim 4, characterised in that the raised border (14) is 
formed by stamping a strap (16) partially punched out of the supporting leg (3) 

and bent at an angle of 90Â°. 
Supporting leg according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the axial 
expansion of the form-fit holder (14, 17, 19, 24) corresponds at least to one thread 

pitch of the fixing screw (6).  
 
Supporting leg according to claim 1, characterised in that the form-fit holder is 
formed by a form-fit bore (23) formed concentrically with the location hole (11), 

engaged by a cylindrical shoulder (24) formed on the screw head (8'), the length of 
which corresponds to at least one thread pitch of the fixing screw (6). 
Supporting leg according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
cylindrical part of the screw head (8) or of the cylindrical shoulder (24) is formed 

by a cylindrical washer (8.1). 
Supporting leg according to claim 9, characterised in that the washer (8.1) is 
captivated on the shank (7) of the fixing screw (6) with axial play smaller than the 

thickness of the supporting leg (3) in the region of the entry slot (10).
