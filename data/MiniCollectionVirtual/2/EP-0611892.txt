<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a collar pivot joint with a housing (1) in which a collar pivot (2) is supported with the ability for rotation and limited tilting. The collar pivot is supported via bearing bushes (3a) in the cylindrical bearing surface (1c) of the housing (1) both at the cylindrical lateral surface (5a) of its collar (5) and at the cylindrical surfaces (7) of the pivot (4) adjoining the said surface by means of annular surfaces (5), and the housing (1) is closed by a cover (10) which effects axial preloading of the bearing bushes (3a). In order, while simultaneously reducing production costs, to achieve a restoring force or tilting elasticity of the collar pivot joint that can be accurately preset, two bearing bushes (3a) are provided, each having an annular part (3c), which covers half the axial extent of the collar (5), and a base part (3b) which is thickened inwards and fills the space between the respective cylindrical surface (7) of the pivot (4) and the housing (1) or the cover (10).

Collar pin joint having a housing (1), in which a 
collar pin (2) is supported so as to be twistable and 

tiltable to a limited extent, which collar pin both at 
the cylindrical lateral surface (5a) of the collar (5) 

and at the cylindrical surfaces (7) of the pin (4), 
which via annular faces (6) adjoin the collar at both 

sides, is supported by means of two bearing bushes (3a) 
in the cylindrical bearing surface (1c) of the housing 

(1), two bearing bushes (3a), which each comprise a 
ring part (3c) owerlapping half of the axial extension 

of the collar (5) and an inwardly thickened base part 
(3b) filling the space between a respective cylindrical 

surface (7) of the pin (4) and the housing (1) or the 
cover (10), being axially preloaded, characterized in 

that the housing (1) is closed by means of a cover 
(10), which effects the axial preloading of the bearing 

bushes (3a), and formed in the base part (3b) is in 
each case an annular groove (9) which is open towards 

the end face (3d) of said base part. 
Tilting bearing according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the edges of the annular groove (9) are connected 

to one another by webs (9a). 
Tilting bearing according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the webs (9a) extend substantially tangentially. 
Tilting bearing according to at least one of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the bearing bushes (3a) are 

made of polyamide.
