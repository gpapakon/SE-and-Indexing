<ABSTRACT>
A crash helmet for motorcyclists, 
motorists, and cyclists, comprises a device, 

including one or more elements, having a half round 
configuration, both in the longitudinal and in the 

cross direction of the spheric body of the helmet, 
the device being constituted by three mutually 

coupled elements, comprising a guide element (A), a 
stabilizer flap supporting element (B), and a stabilizer 

flap (C), these elements being mutually connected either 
in a movable manner, or in a fixed and monolithic 

manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helmet 
for motorcyclists, motorists and cyclists, which has 
been specifically designed for providing, during the 
running, good aerodynamic stabilizing properties. As is known, in the motorcycle field, but 
also in the bicycle and motor vehicle field in 
general, there are used crash helmets for protecting 
the user from damages, in the case of a fall, and 
moreover from wind, dust and rain. In particular, in the case of a motorcycle 
crash helmet, the very high running speeds of modern 
motorcycles originate great problems for a motorcycle 
driver, in particular at his/her head and neck, 
because of the drag and turbulence of the air being 
displaced, which involves a very high physical stress 
on the driver. Usually, such a stress causes the 
driver to be fatigued, with a consequent reduction of 
his driving capabilities, and with dangerous 
consequences for the driver himself. Those same problems also occur in the case 
of helmets used in bicycle and motor vehicle sports. Accordingly, the aim of the present  
 
invention is to overcome the above mentioned 
drawbacks, by providing a crash helmet which, in 
addition to a protective function thereof, is also 
adapted to neutralize the above mentioned negative 
effects, which helmet, in particular, can be safely 
and confortably used at high speeds. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide a helmet for the mentioned applications, 
which is specifically adapted to neutralize the loads 
and aerodynamic turbulences negatively affecting the 
longitudinal and cross axes of the helmet, and this 
by exploiting the well known Venturi effect. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide a helmet construction including a 
stabilizer flap element adapted to cause the air 
passing between said stabilizer flap element and the 
helmet cap to be compressed and accelerated without 
improving and stabilizing the running performance. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a helmet construction which is 
specifically designed to reduce the aerodynamic load 
on the neck of a driver, and this owing to the 
capability of the mentioned stabilizer flap element  
 
to be backwardly or frontwardly displaced. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a helmet construction which has a 
smaller weight, and is more stable and noiseless than 
a conventional type of helmet. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a

<CLAIMS>
A crash helmet for motorcyclists, 
motorists and cyclists, characterized in that said 

helmet is provided with an aerodynamic stabilizing 
device, said device comprising one or more elements, 

having a half-round configuration, both in the 
longitudinal and in the cross direction of the helmet 

spheric body. 
A helmet according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said stabilizing device 

comprises three mutually coupled elements, said 
elements including a guide element, a stabilizer flap 

supporting element and a stabilizer flap element. 
A helmet according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that said three elements are movably 

coupled to one another. 
A helmet according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that said three elements are 

mutually coupled in a fixed and monolithic manner. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said aerodynamic 

stabilizing device is removably affixed on the helmet 
top central portion, so as to be disengaged under an 

outer impact stress. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said stabilizer flap is 

provided with a cross section having a wing profile 
and extending in parallel to the helmet cap. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said stabilizer flap is 

affixed to the helmet so as to change the attitude of 
said stabilizer flap with respect to the helmet cap. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said stabilizer flap 

supporting element, which supports at the top portion 
thereof said stabilizer flap, is adapted to slide 

backwardly and frontwardly in said guide element, 
detent means being provided for restraining the 

sliding movement of said supporting element. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said guide element 

affixed to the cap of said helmet and guiding said 
supporting element comprises a restraining section 

adapted to allow said supporting element to slide 
along said guide without disengaging therefrom, said 

guide element operating as an inlet and outlet air 
guiding element for providing aeration air to the 

inside of said helmet. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said aerodynamic device 

is adapted to press and stabilize the air passing 
between said stabilizer flap and said helmet cap so 

as to improve said air flow thereby providing a 
reduced pressure on a driver neck. 
A helmet according to any preceding 
claims, characterized in that said aerodynamic 

stabilizing device is adapted to also neutralize the 
loads and aerodynamic turbulences affecting the 

longitudinal and cross axis of said helmet.
