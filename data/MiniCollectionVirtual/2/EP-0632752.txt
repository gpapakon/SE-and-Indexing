<ABSTRACT>
A tube making mill setup includes an induction heater (12) for a billet (17), with means (34) to transfer the heated billet directly to a piercing machine. The piercing machine includes main driving and gripping rolls (31, 32) on skewed axes (28, 29) and which drive the billet onto a piercing point (36). Upper and lower control rolls (46, 47) have axes parallel to the direction (19) of billet drive through the machine. Internal cooling of the control rolls and the piercing point is provided by circulating cooling water through them. The piercing point is at the distal end of a mandrel (37) which is swingable through an arc to place the formed tube on a take-away carriage (41).

 PIERCING MILL FOR SEAMLESS TUBE MANUFACTUREBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention:This invention relates generally to the manufacture of seamless tubing, and more particularly to a small sized rolling and piercing mill- Description of the Prior Art:There is a variety of prior art equipment for making seamless tubing and which includes rotary piercing in a machine which uses rolls to grip the stock and advance it through a piercing machine having a mandrel-mounted point ("plug") to pierce the center of the stock as the stock is driven through the machine. The equipment known to me is typically large and expensive, requires a lot of space, is harsh on the tooling involved, and is not readily adapted to comparatively low volume runs of particular sizes of tubing. Also there are machines shown in some prior art patents known to me as follows: Patent No. Inventor Date IssuedKocks 10/03/72Reiley et al . 5/13/75Yoshiwara et al 10/11/77Bretschseider 7/15/80Yoshiwara et al 3/09,82Yamada 10/18/83Hayashi 9/11/84Moltner et al. 2/25/86Staat 3/25/86 

 Pozsgay et al. 4/01/86It appears that most of these machines employ some processing, typically rolling, for various purposes following 

the piercing station. The additional steps require additional space in the processing plant. Also, some of the patents use "shoes" (shoes 12 and 12 and shoes 70 and 72 in the Hayashi patent, for example) to keep the workpiece properly positioned between the skewed driving rolls as those rolls advance the workpiece through the machine. In addition to the friction of the workpiece against the shoes, and the additional power required to drive the workpiece through the machine, the shoes tend to wear out and burn out, because the workpiece is at forging temperature during the piercing operation. Also, the piercing point is subjected to high loads, wear and temperature and must be taken off the arbor after each tube is pierced. The point must then be cooled externally. In addition, the pierced tube is removed from the mill with the arbor laying inside the tube. The arbor is then removed from the tube and cooled externally. Consequently, the piercing points must be replaced frequently. It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome some of these problems associated with prior art equipment. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONDescribed briefly, according to a typical embodiment of the present invention, a tube making mill setup includes an induction heater for a billet, with means to transfer the heated billet directly to a

2. The mill of claim 1 and further comprising: liquid cooling supply conduits from a cooling liquid source to the top and bottom rolls to convey a cooling liquid to the rolls; and return conduits from the top and bottom rolls to convey the cooling liquid back to the source without contacting the stock.
3. The mill of claim 2 and wherein: the top and bottom rolls are coupled to the conduits for 


coÏ€ununication of fluid from the supply conduits through the interior of the top and bottom rolls to the return conduits to cool the interior of the rolls and thereby cool the exterior of the rolls.
4. A tube making mill comprising: a base; first and second tube drive rolls mounted on the base, the rolls being spaced for passage of bar stock between the rolls, the rolls being sized and having rotational axes oriented in different directions to enable the rolls to grip and drive the stock longitudinally forward in a first plane; a piercing plug disposed in the space between the rolls arid having a leading end; top and bottom rolls, the top roll being above the plug and the bottom roll being below the plug, the top and bottom rolls being spaced to admit the bar stock between them as the bar stock passes between the first and second rolls and is driven in a forward direction by the first and second rolls against the leading end of the piercing plug to form a tube around the plug; the top roll being mounted to an arm that pivots upward about a horizontal axis to enable lifting the plug from the space between the first and second rolls.
5. The mill of claim 4 and further comprising: a mandrel located in the first plane and located on a line which extends through the space between the first and second rolls, the mandrel having a proximal end mount which is pivotal on a horizontal axis, and the mandrel having a distal end remote from the proximal end mount, the plug being mounted at the distal end of the mandrel, whereby the plug can be swung upward out of the space between the rolls. 


 6. The mill of claim 5 and wherein: the mandrel is arranged to pivot about the horizontal axis through an arc of about 180 degrees to place a tube formed thereon in position for removal axially from the mandrel by pulling the tube from the mandrel in the same forward direction as the stock is advanced through the rolls.
7. The mill of claim 6 and further comprising: a carriage at the removal position for reception of a formed tube thereon, the carriage being drivable in the forward direction to remove a tube from the mandrel.
