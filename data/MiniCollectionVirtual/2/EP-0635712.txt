<ABSTRACT>
It is known to add a diluent to a patient 
sample prior to applying the diluted sample on to a 

test surface of a test element. However, this 
requires the provision of space in a clinical analyzer 

to allow this dilution to take place, and a longer 
processing time is required. Described herein is a 

method by which a liquid material can be uniformly 
distributed over a surface area (S) of a test element 

(50) by pretreating the surface (S) with a liquid 
diluent prior to the dispensing of the liquid material 

thereto. This is preferably achieved by applying the 

diluent to a surface (6, 7) of a transfer element (10) 
as a surface-dispersed quantity, and then placing the 

surface (6, 7) of the transfer element (10) into 
instantaneous contact with the surface area (S) of the 

slide element (50) thereafter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field
of clinical analyzers for the testing of liquid
analytes, and in particular to a method of preparing a
test element prior to the transferring of a patient
sample.In the field of clinical analyzers for the
testing of liquid analytes, a patient sample is
introduced and caused to interact with a reaction
chemistry to produce a signal involving the analyte of
choice for detection by a sensing apparatus. A
preferred technique involves the so-called dried assay
technology so that patient sample is applied to dried
test slide elements, each having at least one dried
reactant layer. Analyzers and test elements using
this technology include those manufactured by Eastman
Kodak Company, both under the trademark "EKTACHEMâ„¢".There can be problems associated with using
this approach. One such problem relates to how a
quantity of patient sample is dispensed on to the
testing surface of a test element. Typically, a
predetermined amount of patient liquid is metered from
a tip orifice of a disposable pipette tip, the tip
being positioned a short distance above a test
element. An example of a method of dispensing patient
liquid using a metering tip is described in
US-A-5 143 849. Because patient liquid contains
variable amounts of particulate matter, such as lipids
and lipo-proteins, there is a degree of non-uniformity
as to the ability of the liquid to uniformly spread
when it contacts the testing surface of a test
element. In typical test elements, a sample delivered
from a point source has to spread horizontally, as
well as vertically, through the predetermined test
volume of the test element. The need for both 
directions of spreading introduces the possibility of
flow irregularities. WO-A-92/01919 discloses a method of achieving a uniform layer of a sample by spray application of the sample from a dispensing bip.Further, the reliability of test results is
impacted by the sensitivity occurring due to
differences in the makeup of samples between patients.
For example, a patient may have a serum, plasma or
whole blood sample which is particularly fatty, (that
is: containing a higher percentage of lipids and lipoproteins
than a "normal" patient). These sorts of
differences are not, however, limited to non-average
patients; differences in samples between patients in
the so-called normal range may also impact the
accuracy of test results. These effects are generally
known as "matrix effects" and are based on differences
between patient liquid samples, as well as sample
interaction
