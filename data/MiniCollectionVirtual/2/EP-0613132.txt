<ABSTRACT>
A tape-travelling guide apparatus for a tape recorder includes a review 
arm 40 having a review pole 48 being integrally formed with a middle pole 

46 as one body and installed to be operated at an initial point of loading by 
a ring-gear pin 33 of a ring gear 32, thereby reducing the number of 

components and simplifying operation as well as distributing the load 
concentrated around a completion point of loading, to prevent concentrated 

load generation. The tape-travelling guide apparatus is adaptable for VTRs, 
DATs and camcorders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape-travelling guide apparatus for tape
recorders.Generally, as shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying diagrammatic
drawings, a travelling system of a tape recorder includes a supply reel disc 11
and a take-up reel disc 12 for transferring (or transporting) a tape 14 of a
cassette 13, the discs 11, 12 being installed on a deck (not shown). A drum
15 is provided for recording a signal on, or playing back a recorded signal
from, the tape 14 of the cassette 13 seated on the deck.On the left of the drum 15 (as seen in Figure 1), a tension arm 16
having a tension pole 17 on one free end thereof is provided to control the
tension of the tape 14, and an impedance roller 18 is disposed for stably
guiding the travel of the tape 14.On both sides of the deck adjacent to the drum 15, the tape 14 is
guided to the drum 15 via guide rollers 21 and oblique poles 22 of pole bases
which are loaded along loading grooves 19 on the upper portion of the deck
10.On the right of the drum 15, a middle pole 23 for changing a travelling
direction of the tape 14 is fixed on the deck, and a capstan shaft 24 and a
pinch roller 25 are installed for transferring the tape 14 at a constant speed.
Due to a mechanical characteristic of the deck, a review arm 27 carrying a
review pole 26 is provided for securing a smooth state of the tape 14 which
is being transferred along the travel-path on the deck. However, in the conventional tape recorder, since the middle pole 23
is fixed on the deck and the review arm 27 having the review pole 26 on one
free end has to co-operate with a driving mechanism that drives it, the driving
mechanism touches other components on the deck to result in various spatial
limitations which inhibit the tape-travelling guide apparatus from being applied
to a subminiature camcorder deck of pocket-size.Moreover, the operations of the tension arm 16, pole base having the
guide roller 21 and oblique pole 22, pinch roller 25 and review arm 27 are
completed all at once together with other components when the loading of the
tape recorder is completed, so that an excessive load may be imposed upon
the tape recorder. Besides, EP-A-0 087 952 discloses a tape
recorder having a tape guide apparatus comprising :
an arm mounted for pivotal movement about a pivot point located
between first and second portions of the arm;first tape-guiding pole disposed on
said second arm portion;a ring gear arranged to be rotated by a drive gear mechanism; andengagement means provided respectively on said ring
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tape recorder having a tape guide apparatus comprising:

an arm (40) mounted for pivotal movement about a pivot point (44)
located between first and second portions of the arm (40);
first tape-guiding pole (46) disposed
on said second arm portion;
a ring gear (32) arranged to be rotated by a drive gear mechanism (38);
and
engagement means (33, 42) provided respectively on said ring gear (32)
and first arm portion for providing engagement between said ring gear (32)

and first arm portion:
wherein, in use, rotation of said ring gear (32) in opposite directions
causes said arm (40) to pivot about said pivot point (44) in order to move said

arm (40) between first and second tape-guiding positions;

characterised in that a second tape-guiding pole (48) is disposed
on said second arm portion at a spaced position with respect to

said first tape-guiding pole (46).
A tape recorder according to claim 1, wherein said second pole (48) is at
an end of said arm (40).
A tape recorder according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said first pole (46) is
operative to shift a travelling direction of a tape, in use.
A tape recorder according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said first pole (46)
is located between said pivot point (44) and an end of said arm (40).
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said
engagement means comprises a pin (33) provided on said ring gear (32).
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said
engagement means comprises an abutment portion (42) at an end of said arm

(40).
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said
arm (40) includes a contact portion (52) positioned between said first and

second poles (46, 48) to contact, in use, the outer surface of a motor housing
(50) of a capstan motor (36) during loading of a tape into a recording or

playing position.
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, wherein, in said
second tape-guiding position, said poles (46, 48) urge a tape against a capstan

shaft (24).
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said
first pole (46) is inclined to said arm (40) at an angle of less than 90Â°, to

facilitate smooth travel of a respective tape.
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, further
comprising a pinch roller for transferring a tape at a constant speed by closely

pressing said tape to a capstan shaft (24). 
A tape recorder according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said
arm (40) is a review arm, said first pole (46) is a middle pole, and said

second pole (48) is a review pole.
