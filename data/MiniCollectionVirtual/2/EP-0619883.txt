<ABSTRACT>
A novel application for leucocyte retention filters is provided in the form of a method and kit for isolating and/or identifying foreign antigens and/or nucleic acids associated with leucocytes in fluids derived from a human or animal body, and treating, preferably with detergent, in a manner such as to expose them for isolation and/or detection. The method and apparatus provides a simple to obtain yet rapid determination of foreign antigens and/or nucleic acids associated with the leucocytes and thus the likely presence of organisms of which these antigens are characteristic. One significant advantage of this method is that it offers the preparation of a sample outside the laboratory using a few reagents, a syringe and a filter. Using this method the inventors have assembled a pen-side test that can detect animals persistently infected with BVD virus that takes only 1.5 hours, compared to the 7 days required for a virus isolation test.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DETECTION OF ANTIGENS AND NUCLEIC ACIDS.The present invention relates to a method for isolating and/or identifying foreign antigens or nucleic acids associated with leucocytes in fluids derived from a human or animal body, and to kits for carrying this out. More particularly to such a method and kits as specifically adapted to be capable of use 'in the field' in so far as an electric power supply means is not essential to their operation. The method and apparatus of the present invention enable antigens to be derived from a human or animal body and identified without the need for complex laboratory bound equipment. Such method has application, inter alia, in field testing for infection of humans and animals with various infective agents having known antigenic or nucleic acid characteristics. Such testing may be carried out by a physician or veterinarian in their surgery rather than in a laboratory.In blood processing and therapeutics arts there is a requirement to remove leucocytes from blood in order to render it suitable for transfusions or for the purpose of treating those with conditions where leucocytes are in excess, such as leukemia. There exists a large and competitive market in leucocyte 'depletion' or 'removal' filters that are capable of selective removal of leucocytes from blood for these purposes. A great number of sources of such filters will be known to those in the blood product and therapeutic arts.The processing and therapeutic benefits of using these filters are numerous, but include, inter alia, reduction in platelet refractoriness, prevention of transmission of viruses such as cytomegalovirus, prevention of non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reactions and reduction of transfusion associated thrombocytopenia. Direct use to filter a patients blood is helpful in allowing more aggressive anticancer therapy and application to donor tissue fluids and perfusates extends organ preservation time for transplantation. 

 It is known that leucocytes may be analysed to determine the identity of antigens which they have immobilised in the course of their physiological function. Fenton et al (1991) described an antigen detection test for diagnosis of Border disease in sheep using leucocytes as a source of viral antigen while Mignon et al (1991) described a similar test for cattle using a monoclonal antibody for capture and signalling of presence of antigen. Such methods have focused upon analysis of leucocyte 'buffy coat' derived by methods using flash lysis and centrifugation, buffy coat

CLAIMS .
1. A method for identifying foreign antigens and/or nucleic acids associated with leucocytes in fluids derived from a human or animal body, and/or isolating them in cell free form, comprising
(a) passing a sample of the fluid through a filter material having the ability to retain leucocytes thereon,
(b) treating the filter from (a) with an agent capable of acting upon leucocytes to provide foreign antigens and/or nucleic acids therefrom in elutable form,
(c) eluting antigens and/or nucleic acids from the filter,
(d) using the eluant as a source of isolated cell free foreign antigens and/or nucleic acids for performance of identification and/or further isolation steps.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the filter material is encapsulated in a form with a syringe-end fitting.
3. A method wherein the fluid to be filtered is whole blood and an anti-clotting agent is added to the blood in an effective amount prior to the filtration step.
4. A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the anti-clotting agent is EDTA, Na-citrate or heparin.
5. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein step (b) is carried out after the filter material has been rinsed through with a rinse liquid. 


 6. A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the rinse liquid is water, saline or buffer.
7. A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein the buffer is phosphate buffered saline.
8. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the agent used for step (b) is a detergent.
9. A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the detergent is that which is capable of providing the foreign antigens associated with the leucocytes in a form whereby they are provided on the surface of micelles in the eluant.
10. A method as claimed in claim 8 or 9 wherein the detergent is capable of solubilising the leucocytes.
11. A method as claimed in claim 8, 9 or 10 wherein the detergent is a non-ionic detergent.
12. A method as claimed in claim 11 wherein the detergent is a glucopyranoside or a Nonidet (RTM) detergent.
13- A method as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 11 wherein the detergent is removed from the eluant with adsorbent prior to carrying out step (d) or subsequent steps.
