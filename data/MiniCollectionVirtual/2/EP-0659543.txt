<ABSTRACT>
A method of stitching component elements (5) of a 
radial tire, whereby an inner component element (5b) is 

placed inside an outer component element (5a) housed 
inside a toroidal body (7) mounted for rotation about a 

horizontal axis (8) on a saddle (31) adjustable in width 
and supported on a carriage (6); a stitching drum (58) 

is inserted inside the inner component element (5b) and 
toroidal body (7), and is moved radially upwards to 

compress the outer component element (5a) between the 
toroidal body (7) and the inner component element (5b); 

the saddle (31) is widened so that the toroidal body (7) 
weighs on the stitching drum (58); and the toroidal body 

(7) and stitching drum (58) are rotated in relation to 
each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
stitching component elements of road vehicle tires.The present invention is particularly suitable for
producing the second stage assemblies of radial tires -
to which specific reference is made in the following
description purely by way of example - and for
assembling first stage to second stage assemblies.According to EP-A-540048 filed by the present
Applicant, a radial tire is produced by forming the
second stage assembly of the tire on the inner surface
of a toroidal body; separately forming the first stage
assembly of the tire on inner rings supporting the bead
portions of the first stage assembly; placing the first
stage assembly inside the toroidal body and on the inner
surface of the second stage assembly; forming the
sidewalls of the tire, which are placed on the first
stage assembly; and assembling annular walls for
connecting the toroidal body and inner rings and so
forming a mold suitable for use as a curing mold.EP-A-585647, filed by the present Applicant, is
considered in the state of the art under the terms of
Article 54(3) EPC and discloses a method of stitching
component elements of road vehicle tires, which
comprises stages consisting in placing a first component 
element inside a second component element housed inside
a hollow body with adjustable supporting means,
inserting stitching means inside the first component
element and the hollow body, and moving the stitching
means into a raised position to engage the first element
and compress the second element between the first
element and the hollow body.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a straightforward, relatively low-cost stitching method
for achieving substantially perfect adhesion of pairs of
mutually contacting component elements of tires produced
as described above.According to the present invention, there is
provided a method of stitching component elements of
road vehicle tires; the method comprising stages
consisting in placing a first component element inside a
second component element housed inside a hollow body
with adjustable supporting means; inserting stitching
means inside the first component element and the hollow
body; moving the stitching means into a raised position
to engage the first element and compress the second
element between the first element and the hollow body;
adjusting said supporting means so that the hollow body
weighs at least partly on the stitching means; and
rolling the stitching means in contact with the first
element.A non-limiting

<CLAIMS>
A method of stitching component elements (5) of
road vehicle tires; the method comprising stages

consisting in placing a first component element (5b)
inside a second component element (5a) housed inside a

hollow body (7) with adjustable supporting means (31);
inserting stitching means (58) inside the first

component element (5b) and the hollow body (7); moving
the stitching means (58) into a raised position to

engage the first element (5b) and compress the second
element (5a) between the first element (5b) and the

hollow body (7); adjusting said supporting means (31) so
that the hollow body (7) weighs at least partly on the

stitching means (58); and rolling the stitching means
(58) in contact with the first element (5b).
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said
supporting means (31) comprise a roller saddle (31) of

adjustable width; and said hollow body (7) comprises a
toroidal body (7) mounted on the roller saddle (31) so

as to rotate about a substantially horizontal axis (8);
the toroidal body (7) being caused to weigh at least

partly on the stitching means (58) by increasing the
width of the saddle (31).
A method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said
stitching means (58) are rolled in contact with the 

first element (5b) by rotating the toroidal body (7)
about said axis (8).
A method as claimed in any one of the foregoing
Claims, wherein said stitching means (58) comprise a

drum (58) rotating about its axis (59); the drum being
moved transversely to said axis (59) into said raised

position.
