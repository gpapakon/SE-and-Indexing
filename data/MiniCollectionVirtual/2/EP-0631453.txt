<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for locating 
mobile stations in a digital telecommunication network, 

especially the GSM network. According to the invention, 
reference measurements are carried out on relevant 

traffic routes with the aid of a measuring mobile in 
order to provide position information related to measured 

signals. With the aid of these reference data and the 
position information, an adaptive neural network is 

trained, which network, with the aid of corresponding 
measurement data which are transmitted from the mobile 

station to a respective base station, carries out the 
localisation of the mobile station. Use of the adaptive 

neural network provides a more accurate position determination 
than earlier systems which were only based on 

the TA (timing advance) value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
locating mobile stations in a digital telephone network,
especially the GSM network. The invention utilizes a
combination of reference measurements using a measuring
mobile and an adaptive neural network which is trained by
means of the reference data. The neural network then uses
existing measurement data from mobile stations in order
to locate the latter.Various systems for locating are already known.EP 0 512 789 shows a locating system of high
accuracy which utilizes the global positioning system
(GPS) for determining position, speed and time information
for, for example, a vehicle in a mobile radio
system. To increase the accuracy in position determination,
reference measurements can be made at known locations.
These reference measurements are utilized for
increasing the locating accuracy in the areas around
these locations. The system also has the possibility of
storing a digital map of the area in question and
utilizing this for facilitating the position calculations.EP 0 335 558 describes a radio communications
system with fixed and mobile stations. The mobile stations
can be located by measuring the transit time for
signals between the mobile stations and at least two
fixed stations. The accuracy of the system can be
improved by storing data which represent a route map of
the area in question in the base stations. The calculated
position can then be adjusted in accordance with the map
by assuming that the mobile station is located on a road.US 5 166 694 describes a system for locating 
vehicles. The system is provided with good accuracy by
utilizing all the information which is available in the
fixed receivers. The system then selects an optimum array
of information which provides the smallest error and uses
this array for calculating the position. The calculation
time can be shortened by only using part of the available
information.US 5 043 736 relates to a cellular telephone
system with the possibility of obtaining the current
position of a person in the system. The mobile station,
which is located with the aid of satellites, transmits
information about its position to the cellular telephone
system. The position of the mobile station can be centrally
monitored with the aid of this information.EP 0 431 956 shows a way of monitoring a mobile
telephone system. The system has the possibility of
receiving, via the base stations, data such as position,
signal quality and signal strength for a mobile during an
ongoing call. This information can then be
