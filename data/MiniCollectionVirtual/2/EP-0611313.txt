<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to leads for use with dual 
chamber pacemakers and, more particularly, to a single lead 
system for providing at least 
ventricular stimulation and also providing atrial sensing 
through two spaced bipoles located on the lead. Dual chamber pacemakers are recognized to have a 
greater capacity for optimum physiologic stimulation of the 
heart than single chamber devices, for many patients. 
However, dual chamber systems conventionally require 
implantation of two intracardiac leads, which has long been 
widely viewed as an obstacle. A dual chamber system using a 
single multipolar lead to sense the atrium and to stimulate 
the right ventricle, i.e., operating in a VDD mode, can 
avoid the difficulties related to separate atrial lead 
implantation. Such VDD stimulation using a single lead for 
atrial sensing and ventricular pacing has become a reality. 
During the last decade, several such systems for permanent 
atrial sensing and pacing have been tested. More recently, 
new types of multipolar leads have been developed using 
novel arrangements where electrodes are positioned on the 
atrial floating portion of a single right ventricular 
catheter. See, for example, the paper of Goldreyer et al., 
"A New orthogonal Lead For P-synchronous Pacing," PACE, 
1981, 4:638-644; Goldreyer et al., "Orthogonal Electrogram  
 
Sensing," PACE, 1983, 6:464-469; Brownlee, "Toward 
Optimizing the Detection of Atrial Depolarization With 
Floating Bipolar Electrodes," PACE, 1989, 12:431-442. At the present time, a half-ring electrode system is 
commercially available. This system consists of a unipolar 
VDD pacemaker and a single lead with a ventricular pacing 
electrode and a single supplementary half-ring bipole on its 
proximal atrial floating portion. Also, pacemakers have 
been introduced with Holter capabilities for monitoring and 
storing cardiac rhythm abnormalities, although these 
capabilities are generally limited to certain simple 
arrhythmias. Thus, the detection of the atrial electrogram 
(AEG) and the technical means for Holter monitoring and 
storage, are generally known in the prior art. In addition a lead system having at about its 
proximal end a connector for connecting to a pacemaker, a 
stimulus electrode at about its distal end for delivering 
stimulus signals, at least two bipoles positioned for 
sensing signals in the atrium, and conducting means for 
conducting signals between the electrode and the connector 
and between the bipoles and the connector may be seen in
