<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for laying underground pipelines (5) in the region of existing pipelines (2), in the case of which method and apparatus at least one pulling trench (3) and at least one feeding trench (4) are provided over the existing pipeline (2), the existing pipeline (2) in the region of the pulling trench (3) is severed over a length which permits the operation of a pulling apparatus (11) and/or the production of a line connection to pipes and mouldings, the existing pipeline (2) in the region of the feeding trench is severed over a length which permits the feeding and attachment of new metal pipe pieces (5) having a smaller external diameter than the internal diameter of the existing pipeline (2), a pipe piece is connected to a pipe-guiding head (7) and is introduced into the existing pipeline (2) to such a distance that a further pipe piece (5) can be connected to that which has already been introduced, and the feeding and attachment of new pipe pieces continued until the region of the existing pipeline (2) between the pulling trench (3) and the feeding trench (4) is completely provided with a new pipeline (5).

Method for laying underground pipelines, wherein

at least one pulling pit and at least one threading
pit are excavated over an existing, at least

temporarily blocked pipeline,
in the region of the pulling pit the existing pipeline
is separated over a length sufficient to allow the

operation of a pulling device and/or the formation of
a pipeline connection with pipes and fittings,
in the region of the threading pit the existing
pipeline is separated over a length sufficient to

allow the threading in and joining on of metallic pipe
sections having an external diameter smaller than the

internal diameter of the existing pipeline,
a pipe section having a pipe guide head is introduced
into the existing pipeline,
a further pipe section is connected to the free end of
the section last introduced,
the introduction and joining on of new pipe sections
is continued until the region of the former pipeline

between the pulling pit and the threading pit is
completely provided with a new pipeline,
the pipe sections being connected by means of a
tension-proof spigot-and-socket joint to one another

and to the section with the pipe guide head which was
introduced first, and
each spigot-and-socket joint of the pipeline being
introduced being guided by a conical sheet metal

sleeve which has been slipped over it.
Method for laying underground steel pipelines, wherein

at least one pulling pit and at least one threadinq
pit are excavated over an existing, at least

temporarily blocked pipeline,
in the region of the pulling pit the existing pipeline
is separated over a length sufficient to allow the

operation of a pulling device and/or the formation of
a pipeline connection with pipes and fittings,
in the region of the threading pit the existing
pipeline is separated over a length sufficient to

allow the threading in and joining on of steel pipe
sections having an external diameter smaller than the

internal diameter of the existing pipeline,
a steel pipe section having a pipe guide head is
introduced into the existing pipeline,
a further steel pipe section is connected to the free
end of the section last introduced,
the introduction and joining on of new steel pipe
sections is continued until the region of the former

pipeline between the pulling pit and the threading pit
is completely provided with a new steel pipeline,
the steel pipe sections being welded to one another
and to the section with the pipe guide head which was

introduced first, and
corrosion protection means being provided, comprising
a double layer of plastics material, preferably

provided with longitudinal ribs.
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in
that the interconnected pipe sections, guided by the pipe

guide head, are pushed through the old pipeline. 
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in
that the interconnected pipe sections are pulled through

the old pipeline from the pulling pit by means of a
pulling cable fastened to the pipe guide head.
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the pipeline being introduced is

guided by means of a preferably conical pipe guide head.
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the annular space between the

existing and the introduced pipelines is filled with a
hydraulically setting flowable filler material.
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that for the production of branch or

house connection lines the existing pipeline is opened up
and pipe stubs are welded on, or tapping sleeves

attached, to the introduced pipeline which has been
uncovered.
A pipeline comprising socketed pipe sections (5) over the
sockets (6) of which conical pipe guide sleeves (8) are

slipped, for non-destructive laying of pipelines of this
kind in existing pipelines (2) as claimed in any of

claims to 7.
A pipeline according to claim 8, characterised by a
preferably conical pipe guide head (7) placed on the

start of the pipe.
