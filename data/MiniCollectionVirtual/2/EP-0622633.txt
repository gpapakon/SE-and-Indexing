<ABSTRACT>
An immunological method for determining triazine and triazine derivatives by a competitive immunoassay in which the sample and labelled atrazine compete for a polyclonal antibody which is bound to a solid phase before, during or after the immunological reaction, binding of the immunological complex to the solid phase, separation of the solid phase and unbound labelled atrazine and determination of the label in the solid and liquid phase as a measure of the content of triazine and triazine derivatives is characterised in that polyclonal antibodies which have been obtained by immunisation with a 4-alkylamino-S-triazine and, as labelled atrazine, a conjugate of a label and 4-amino-S-triazine which is bonded via the 6 position to the label, are used. Triazines and triazine derivatives can be determined simultaneously with this method.
