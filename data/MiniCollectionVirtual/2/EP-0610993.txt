<ABSTRACT>
A device for receiving excrements and urine of 
domestic cats comprises a housing (1) including a tray (2) having a 

cover (3) and a lateral passage opening (18). The housing (1) comprises 
accommodating means (12,13) for removably accommodating a screen (14) 

above 
the passage opening (18), said housing (1) being adapted to be turned 

upside down. When clamp forming litter is used in this device 
there may be obtained an easy separation of clumps from the 

remaining litter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
receiving excrements and urine of domestic cats, comprising a 
housing including a tray having a cover and a lateral passage 
opening. Such device, in practice known as litter box, is 
known in several embodiments and is also used without cover. 
The tray is filled with litter, mostly in the form of grit, on 
which the cat may defecate. The closed embodiment of the 
device having a cover and only a passage opening has the 
advantage that it reduces the risk of litter being thrown out 
by the cat. Regarding to litter used in the device it is noted 
that two main types of marketed litter may be distinguished. A 
first type of litter more or less absorbs the excrements and 
liquid. After a short while, the complete filling of the tray 
should be replaced as a result of a bad smell and as a result 
of the fact that the cat does not use a dirty litter box. A 
second type of litter encloses the excrements and urine by its 
grit which causes the formation of clumps. The clumps are 
virtually dry on the outer side and do not adhere to the 
unused litter. This enables a separation of the clumps from 
the other grit so that the clean litter can remain in the tray 
for further use and should only be replenished. For separating 
the clumps from the remainder of the litter, only a scoop or 
the like is available now with which the clumps may be scooped 
out of the box, if necessary after removal of the cover. From US-A-4,522,150 a cat litter disposal housing is 
known having accommodating means for removably accommodating a 
screen, whereby the housing is adapted to be turned over. The 
screen is used to collect agglomerated litter and excrements 
from a cat which are priorly disposed on the litter residing 
on the housing's floor. Through rotation of the housing the 
agglomerated litter and excrements are collected on the screen 
for subsequent removal. However, in the housing according to 
US 4,522,150 there is a risk that agglomerated litter and 
possibly excrements by-pass the screen during rotation. The object of the invention is to overcome this 
problem and to provide a device which enables an easy  
 
separation of the formed clumps from the remainder of the 
litter. To obtain this object, the invention provides a 
device wherein the housing's cover itself is also constructed 
as a tray enabling the use of the housing upside down, and 
that the screen, in its operative position, separates the 
spaces within the tray and cover below and above it. In the device

removably accommodating a screen (14), said housing (1) being 
adapted to be turned over, 
characterized
 in that the cover (3) 
itself is also constructed as a tray to use the housing upside 

down and in that the screen, in its operative position, 
separates the spaces within the tray (2) and cover (3) below 

and above it.  
 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the 
accommodating means (12, 13) are formed such that the screen 

(14) may be supported adjacent both the tray (2) and the cover 
(3). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
housing (1) is symmetrical with respect to a horizontal 

central plane. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the housing (1) is supported pivotable around a 

substantially horizontal axis (6). 
Device according to claim 4, wherein the housing 
(1) is pivotally arranged on a base (6). 
Device according to claim 5, wherein the housing 
(1), in its operative position, is retained from rotation 

relative to the base (6) by locking means (23, 24). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the accommodating means include parallel horizontal 

slots (12, 13) in opposite side walls (4) of the housing (1) 
in which lateral edges (15) of the screen (14) fit. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the passage opening (18) of the housing (1) is 

arranged in a removable front panel (16) locking the screen 
(14) in the operative position. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein a, preferably rod-shaped, spacer (20) for keeping the 

cat away from the side walls (4) extends along said side walls 
(4) within the housing (1). 
Device according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the  
 

front panel (16), the screen (14) and possibly the spacer (20) 
are assembled into a unit.
