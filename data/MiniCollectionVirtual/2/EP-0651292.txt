colorant and a wax. The toner contains polymerizable 
vinyl monomer or a mixture of organic solvent and 

polymerizable vinyl monomer in an amount of not more

or plural kinds of polymerizable vinyl monomer, a 

styrene-diene copolymer comprised of styrene or a 
styrene derivative and butadiene or isoprene in a 

copolymerization weight ratio of from 95:5 to 65:35,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a toner for
developing electrostatic images, and a process for
producing it. It has been proposed to use a method in
which a toner containing a release agent such as wax
is produced by suspension polymerization or emulsion
polymerization. In this suspension polymerization, a
monomer composition is prepared by uniformly
dissolving or dispersing a colorant (optionally
together with a polymerization initiator, a cross-linking
agent, a charge control agent and other
additives) in polymerizable monomers, and thereafter
the monomer composition is dispersed by means of a
suitable stirrer in a continuous phase (e,g, an
aqueous phase) containing a dispersion stabilizer, to
carry out polymerization to obtain toner particles
having the desired particle diameters.In this suspension polymerization, the monomer
composition is granulated in a greatly polar
dispersion medium such as water, and hence the
particles formed take a pseudo-capsular structure in 
which components having polar groups, contained in the
monomer composition, are present in the surface layer
portion which forms the interface between the
particles and the dispersion medium, and non-polar
components are present in the inside. Utilizing such
a characteristic of this method, it is possible to
encapsulate a low-melting wax in the toner particles.Because of the encapsulation of a low-melting
wax, the toner produced by polymerization can achieve
both anti-blocking and low-temperature fixing, which
are performances conflicting with each other. Since
the low-melting wax is encapsulated in toner
particles, the wax melting at a lower temperature
contributes to an improvement in thermal conductivity
of toner without lowering anti-blocking properties, so
that it becomes possible to fix the toner at a lower
temperature. As an additional advantage, the wax
having melted at the time of fixing also acts as a
release agent, and hence it is possible to prevent
high-temperature offset without applying a release
agent such as silicone oil to the fixing roll.When the low-melting wax is, however, dissolved
or dispersed in a large quantity in the monomer
composition to carry out granulation in an aqueous
medium, it is difficult to carry out the granulation
compared with the case of a monomer composition 
containing no wax, tending to allow the resulting toner
to have a broad particle size distribution.The present invention relates to a toner having the
features set out in claim 1 of the accompanying claims
and to a process of producing the toner
