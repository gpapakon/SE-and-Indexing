<ABSTRACT>
Novel methods and microorganisms are 
provided, where novel genetic mammalian cell invasive 

capability is imparted to a microorganism by the 
introduction of an exogenous 
ail
 gene. The resulting 
organisms are then capable of binding to mammalian cells 

and are transferred to the cytoplasm. Other novel 
genetic capabilities may be imparted to the unicellular 

microorganism, which may serve as a vaccine for one or 
more pathogens or may introduce genetic capabilities or 

foreign molecules into a mammalian host cell. The 
sequences may be used for an 
in
vitro
 screen for 
pathogenicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
Application Serial no. 761,222, filed July 31, 1985, 
which is incorporated herein by reference. The field of this invention concerns 
compositions related to invasive capability of 
microorganisms. For many species of microorganisms, invasion 
and survival within mammalian cells is central to 
establishing a successful host-parasite relationship. 
This localization within host cells may protect the 
microorganism to cross epithelial barriers and 
subsequently become systemically distributed. The 
precise mechanisms by which bacteria enter host tissues 
have been unclear. The invasive character of pathogens, 
while deleterious to the health and viability of host 
cells, does provide a mechanism for transfer of 
molecules and aggregates across an intact cellular 
membrane. Thus, if the invasive quality could be 
transferred to an innocuous microorganism strain, such a 
strain could serve as a vehicle for transporting 
molecules of interest into the cytoplasm and organelles 
of host cells. There is a further consideration in that the 
microorganism could provide for the transfer of genetic 
material into the mammalian host cell. In this manner, 
novel genetic capabilities could be imparted to the host 
cell. One capability of interest would be the synthesis  
 
of surface membrane proteins or envelope proteins of 
pathogens. These proteins would then serve as antigens 
to provide a strong immune response, without the host 
having to suffer the effects of infection by the 
pathogen. The invasion of epithelial cells by Yersinia 
pseudotuberculosis is reported by Bovallius and Nilson, 
(1975) Can. J. Microbiol. 21:1997-2007 and Bolin etal., 
(1982) Infect. Immun. 37:506-512. The factors associated 
with Shigellae invasiveness are described by 
Hale etal., (1983) Infect. Immun. 40:340-350. 
Sansonetti etal., (1983) ibid39:1392-1402 and Maurelli 
etal., (1985) ibid49:164-171 describe the manipulation 
of the plasmid in Shigellae encoding functions essential 
for invasiveness. Isberg and Falkow, (1985) Nature317:262-264 
and Isberg etal., (1987) Cell50:769-778 describe the 
invasion locus of Yersiniapseudotuberculosis. Falkow 
etal., reviews of infectious diseases, 9 Supp. 5 S450-S455 
(1987) describes the Yersinia gene inv. Miller and 
Falkow, (1988) Inf. and Imm. 56:1242-1248 describe a 
second invasion gene named ail (for attachment invasion 
locus). Miller etal., Science243:916-922 describe 
factors involved with virulence of bacterial pathogens.
