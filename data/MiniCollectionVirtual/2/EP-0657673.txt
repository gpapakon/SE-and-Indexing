<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connector 20 for delivering 
combustion gas to a gas fired appliance 22 from a stationary 

supply line 24 where the appliance 22 moves toward and away 
from the supply line 24 with the connector 20 straightening 

and flexing between them as the appliance 22 moves. The 
connector 20 comprises a flexible hose assembly 50 and first 

and second swivel fittings 52, 54 at respective hose assembly 
ends. Each swivel fitting 52, 54 defines a gas flow path and 

comprises a swivel member for communicating the connector 20 
with the appliance 22 for the supply line 24. The hose 

assembly 50 comprises a flexible metal hose member 56 and 
antitorsion fittings forming ends of the hose assembly 50 

connected to respective swivel fittings 52, 54. The 
antitorsion fittings comprise pintle and nipple members 

rotatable relative to each other to prevent torsional stress 
in the hose member 56 when the appliance 22 moves relative to 

the supply line 24.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to connectors for delivering gas to commercial
gas fired appliances and more particularly to flexible connectors which enable
moving the appliances for cleaning and maintenance without disconnecting the gas
supply.Commercial gas fired appliances, such as fryers, ranges and stoves, used in
restaurants and other commercial and institutional kitchens, must be moved
frequently to permit cleaning beneath and behind them as well as for enabling
maintenance, repairs and inspections. Such appliances can weigh several hundred
pounds and are equipped with casters to facilitate movement.Connectors for delivering gas to commercial gas fired appliances have been
constructed to permit movement without disconnecting the gas supply lines. One
proposal was to construct the connector from lengths of rigid pipe connected
together by relatively rotatable sealed swivel joints so that the pipe assembly was
flexed and straightened and the appliance moved toward and away from its normal
operating location.Even though the pipe assemblies were capable of flexure during appliance
movements the assemblies rigidly resisted movements in certain directions. When
appliances turned during movement, bending and wrenching moments were exerted
on the pipes and the swivel joints.Flexible connectors have been proposed to enable turning the appliances
while moving them to and away from their operating positions. Flexible
connectors have been fashioned from flexible metal hoses and associated fittings
for securing the hose ends to the appliances and the supply lines. Such connectors
were flexed when the appliance was in its operating position and straightened out 
to permit moving the appliance from the operating position. The connectors were
flexible enough to permit the appliance to turn or shift laterally relative to its
operating position if desired.Where the connector ends were rigidly fixed to the supply line and the
appliance, tensioning the connector could damage the metal hose. Flexible metal
hoses could be kinked and ruptured when the associated appliance was moved too
far or too much force was applied. Kinking was a particular problem if an
appliance was roughly pulled from its operating position to a location where the
connector was taut and highly tensioned. Safety tethers were employed to limit the
appliance travel from its normal location and prevent tautening the connectors, but
tethers were not always effective.A proposal has been made to provide triaxial swivel assemblies at the ends
of the

<CLAIMS>
A connector (320) for delivering combustion gas to a
gas fired appliance from a stationary supply line, the

appliance being movable toward and away from the supply
line with the connector between them, the connector

straightening, flexing and tending to twist between
them as the appliance moves, said connector (320)

comprising:

a first swivel fitting (324) connected to the
supply line and comprising a body and a swivel member

connected together for movement relative to each other
and conducting gas from the supply line;
a second swivel fitting connected to the appliance
and comprising a second body and a second swivel member

connected together for movement relative to each other
and conducting gas to the appliance; and
a hose assembly (322) extending between said first
and second swivel fittings, said hose assembly

comprising;
a flexible metal hose member (334);
at least one antitorsion fitting (332) connected to
the first and/or second swivel fittings (324);
said at least one antitorsion fitting comprising a
pintle member (360) and a nipple member (362);
a bearing and sealing arrangement (364) between
said pintle (360) and nipple members (362), said pintle

and nipple members defining flow passages (370, 386)
therethrough for conducting gas to the appliance with

said nipple members (362) mounted on said pintle member 
(360) for rotation relative thereto; said bearing and

seal arrangement (364) disposed between said pintle and
nipple members for facilitating relative rotation

between said nipple member and said pintle member and
blocking the flow of gas from said passages along the

juncture of said nipple and pintle members;

characterized in that

the at least one antitorsion fitting (332) forms
one end of said hose assembly (322), respectively;
the pintle member (36) is hermetically fixed to the
hose member, and the nipple member (362) is fixed

to the swivel fitting (324);
said nipple and pintle members (360, 362) rotating
relative to each other to prevent torsional stress

in said hose members (334) when said appliance
moves relative to said supply line.
The connector claimed in claim 1 wherein said pintle
member (360) comprises a cylindrical element defining

an annular end face hermetically welded one end of said
hose.
The connector claimed in claim 2 wherein said nipple
member (362) comprises a threaded end projecting into a

threaded swivel member opening.
The connector claimed in claim 1 further comprising a
sheath (346) formed from woven wire surrounding said

hose member and coterminous therewith, and a weldment

(352) fixing the respective axial ends of said hose
member and said sheath together.
