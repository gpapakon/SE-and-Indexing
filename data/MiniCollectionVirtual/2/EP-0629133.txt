<ABSTRACT>
Peptides containing a biological-function domain and a medically useful metal ion-binding domain and proteins containing monosulfide or disulfide bonds are labeled with medically useful metal ions for use in diagnosis and treatment of a variety of pathologic conditions. The peptides have the amino acid sequence (R1)-[Y1]n-(R2), (R1)-[Y1-(R2)-Y1]
n-(R3), and (R1)-[Y1-(R2)-Y2]n-(R3), with the biological-function domain optionally containing the sequence IKVAV and YIGSR. The medically useful metal ion-binding domain is [Y1]
n, [Y1-(R2)-Y1]n or [Y1-(R2)-Y2]
n. Sn(II) agents are used to label the proteins with medically useful metal ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of labelling peptides with
radioactive, paramagnetic and other medically useful metal ions, and
compositions comprising such labelled peptides for the detection of
thrombus, cancer, infection, inflammation and various lung diseases,
pathologies and abnormalities.The use of proteins, particularly antibodies, as biologically active
targeting agents for medically useful metal ions has been explored. These
products can be administered to the human body to visualise or monitor
functioning of various parts of the body or to determine the presence and
location of particular antigens, antibodies, hormones or the like; and can
be used in the treatment of various disease states. Antibodies and
antibody fragments have been labelled with a number of radionucleides for
use in clinical diagnosis. Radionucleides commonly used include 131I, 125I,
123I, 99mTc, 67Ga, and 111In for diagnostic imaging; and radionucleides such
as 90Y, 188Re, and 186Re, and to a lesser extent, 199Au, 131I and 67Cu for
targeted therapy, primarily in the treatment of cancer. There are also
useful metals for magnetic resonance imaging, including gadolinium,
manganese, copper, iron, gold and europium, which are not radioisotopes.
So far, limited work have been done with labelling with positron-emitting
radiometals, although some types of proteins, such as transferrin and
human serum albumin, have been labelled with 68Ga.Two primary methods have been employed to label antibodies with
radiometals, with particular emphasis having been placed on radiolabelling
with 99mTc. In one method, bifunctional chelates are conjugated to the
antibody, and the bifunctional chelate is then radiolabelled. A variety
of bifunctional chelates have been employed; most involve metal ion
binding to thiolate groups, and may also involve metal ion binding to
amide, amine or carboxylate groups. Representative bifunctional chelates
include ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetetramine-pentaacetic
acid (DTPA), chelates of diamide-dimercaptides (N2S2), and
variations on the 
foregoing, such as chelating compounds incorporating N2S3, N2S4 or N3S3
metal binding sites, and metallothionine. The alternative method of
radiolabeling antibodies involves reduction of disulfide bonds in the
protein, with subsequent binding of the metal ion to thiolate groups.
A variety of reducing agents have been employed, including stannous
salts, dithiothreitol and 2 -mercaptoethanol.Antibodies and antibody fragments have been labeled with a
number
