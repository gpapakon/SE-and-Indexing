<ABSTRACT>
A support having a graphical image is provided with a 
security element against copying systems. The security 

element is a light-diffusing coating applied onto the 
support and covering the graphical image at least in part. 

The coating diffuses incident light in a reflecting manner, 
as a consequence of which the underlying image becomes 

poor or invisible for a copying system which scans 
the support by means of light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a support provided with a graphical 
image. Such a support can be an original document, a security or 
another document. In order to protect such a support against undesirable 
copying, a great number of security elements against copying 
are known. Most of these security elements require 
expensive or complex adaptation of the supports, as a 
consequence of which they are not generally applicable, 
even though they provide good security. It is the aim of the present invention to supply a support 
provided with a graphical image which may simply and 
inexpensively be protected against undesirable copying. For this purpose a support provided with a graphical image 
according to the invention is characterized in that the 
support is provided with a light-diffusing coating which 
covers the graphical image at least in part. The invention 
is based on the insight that the present copying systems, 
especially colour photocopying machines, are provided with 
a scanning system having a light source and a sensor which 
are moved over the support with the graphical image to be 
copied. The light which is diffused by the light-diffusing 
coating diffuses too much light to the sensor, as a consequence  
 
of which the underlying image is no longer detectable. 
Consequently, it is not possible to copy the graphical 
image, while the graphical image on the support 
does remain visible to the human eye. In a preferred embodiment of a support according to the 
invention the coating is a pigmented varnish system. This 
coating has a sufficiently long life. The coating is more easily visible to the human eye when 
the pigment is an iridescent pigment having colouring 
power. Under observation from different angles the coating 
displays different reflection colours. The pigment preferably contains mica or mother of pearl. 
Mica provides a good light diffusion with iridescent 
effect at a low ratio of amount of pigment and the printed 
volume, while mother of pearl can yield white by substractive 
colour mixing and yields a grey glittering non-copyable 
print. Moreover, the mother of pearl colours are 
clearly recognizable under a microscope. A light diffusing coating which can be obtained in a 
simple way can be realised when the coating is a semi-transparent 
coating containing an amount of a reflecting 
element. Preferably, the reflecting element contains 
silver or bismuth. As a consequence of its good reflecting 
properties, silver provides a good reflection of light at 
a low ratio of amount
