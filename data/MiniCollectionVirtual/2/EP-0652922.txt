<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the use of mixed hydroxydes of bivalent and trivalent metals with a three-dimensional space-lattice structure of the garnet type to control the thixotropic thickening of aqueous preparations, using swellable clays and/or other swellable layer-silicate compounds of natural and/or synthetic origin as visosity-increasing agents. The preferred garnet-type mixed hydroxydes are catoites of the basic structure Ca3Al2(OH)12 a minor proportion of whose OH units can be exchanged for acid groups, in particular silicate groups.
