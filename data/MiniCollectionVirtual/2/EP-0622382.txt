<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a catalyst and a process for control of 
desired properties in the polymer product. The catalyst is used in the 

copolymerization of olefins, specifically ethylene and propylene, and is 
prepolymerized, preferably ex situ, to increase randomness. 
Prepolymerization deposits a polymer coating on the catalyst, the weight 
ratio of polymer coating to catalyst being less than about 10:1, preferably 

about 5:1 and, most preferably about 2.3:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
TECHNICAL FIELD : The present invention provides a process for the co-polymerization
of olefins that include prepolymerization of a conventional
supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst to increase the randomness of ethylene-propylene
copolymer.DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART : Catalysts for the polymerization/copolymerization
of olefins are well known in the art. Typically, these
catalysts include a Ziegler-Natta type polymerization catalyst component;
a co-catalyst, usually an organoaluminum compound; and an electron donor
compound. Examples of such catalysts are shown in the following U.S.
Patents: 4,107,413; 4,294,721; 4,439,540; 4,115,319; 4,,220,554;
4,460,701; and 4,562,173; in European Patents : EP-0531,834; and EP-0360491;
and in Japanese Patents : JP-A-61069815; and JP-A-3294309.A Ziegler-Natta type polymerization catalyst is basically a complex derived
from a halide of a transition metal, for example, titanium, chromium or
vanadium with a metal hydride and/or a metal alkyl that is typically an
organoaluminum compound. The catalyst is usually comprised of a titanium halide supported on a
magnesium compound complexed with an alkylaluminum. An electron donor may
be added for stereoselectivity control.A Ziegler-Natta catalyst may be pre-polymerized to improve the performance
of the catalyst. Generally, a prepolymerization process is effected by
contacting a small amount of monomer with the catalyst after the catalyst
has been contacted with the co-catalyst and the electron donor. An in situ
pre-polymerization process is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,767,735. As
provided in this disclosure, a carrier stream for the catalyst is provided,
the catalyst is contacted with the co-catalyst or organoaluminum compound,
the catalyst is contacted with the electron donor, the catalyst is contacted
with a relatively small amount of the total amount of monomer to be
polymerized, the catalyst passes through a tubular reactor, and the carrier
stream introduces the pre-polymerized catalyst into the polymerization
reaction zone. The electron donor may be contacted with the catalyst
simultaneously with the co-catalyst. A polymer product may then be
withdrawn from the reactor. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5, 122,583,
an ex situ prepolymerized catalyst may also be used in this process.It would be advantageous to control properties of the polymer product
through the variation of a process variable or modification of the catalyst
system. Specifically, if an increase in randomness of ethylene-propylene
co-polymer could be obtained
