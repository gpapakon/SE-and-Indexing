<ABSTRACT>
A method for pulling wires by means of a pilot wire (24,25), in which 
ends of 

the pilot wire are fixed, makes it possible to keep re-using 
the pilot wire at 

one particular point, thus without the pilot wire always having 
to be re-installed. 

For this purpose, the pilot wire must either be considerably 
longer 

than the distance between the points where the ends are fixed, 
such as a pilot 

wire in the form of an elongated loop, or the pilot wire must 
be elastic. An 

elastic pilot wire also has the advantage that during the fastening 
of wires to 

the fastening point or detaching of wires therefrom, it is possible 
to deviate 

from the shortest conceivable line between the ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for pulling a wire
by means of a pilot wire wherein said wire is to be
fastened to a fastening point of the said pilot wire.Such a method is generally known, in the case of which
one end of the pilot wire usually serves as the fastening
point to which the wire to be pulled is fastened, and the
other end of the pilot wire is then pulled. Due to the fact
that the pilot wire can often be installed more simply at a
particular point than the wire to be pulled, the wire to be
pulled can then be pulled in an equally simple manner to
the point in question. Of course, various wires to be
pulled can also be pulled simultaneously by means of one
pilot wire.One of the disadvantages of such a known method is that
installing the pilot wire at some points takes about the
same effort as installing the wire to be pulled without
pilot wire (for example in main distribution frames in
telephone exchanges), so that in this case the use of the
pilot wire is not worthwhile.The object of the invention is, inter alia, to provide
a method of the above-mentioned type mentioned in which,
while it takes about the same effort to install the pilot
wire as to install the wire without pilot wire, it is still
worthwhile to use the pilot wire.To this end, the method according to the invention is
characterized in that the said pilot wire comprises fixed
ends and the method comprises the step of fastening the said pilot wire to the fastening point which lies
between the said fixed ends. Due to the fact that the pilot wire has fixed ends, the pilot wire need
be installed only once, following which it can be used repeatedly for pulling
wires. Thanks to the fixed or immovable ends, a pilot wire which has been
pulled as much as possible to one end can always be pulled back again from
the other end. For this purpose, the length of the pilot wire could, for
example, be considerably greater than the distance between the points where
the ends are fixed, for example twice as great, in which case the fastening
point lying between the fixed ends could lie halfway along the pilot wire. In
this way, at a first point the fastening point is moved to said first point by
exerting forces on the pilot wire, and the wire or wires to be pulled is or are
fastened to the fastening point in the vicinity of the first point, following
which at a second point the fastening point is moved to said second point by
exerting forces on the pilot wire, in which case the wire or wires to be pulled
is or are moved with it. The wire or wires
