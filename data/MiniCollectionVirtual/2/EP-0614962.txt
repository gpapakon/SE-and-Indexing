<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to Group II
metal overbased sulfurized alkylphenate compositions
and, in particular, to Group II metal overbased
sulfurized alkylphenate compositions derived from
alkylphenols enriched in substantially straight
chain C12 to C22 alkyl substituents attached to the
phenol ring in a "middle" position.The operation of diesel and spark ignition
internal combustion engines is typically accompanied
by the formation of sludge, lacquer and resinous
deposits which adhere to the moving engine parts and
thereby reduce engine efficiency. In order to
prevent or reduce the formation of these deposits, a
wide variety of chemical additives have been
developed for incorporation into lubricating oils.
These additives are commonly referred to as
detergents and dispersants. Dispersants have the
ability to keep deposit forming materials suspended
in the oil so as to retard deposit formation during
engine operation. Detergents have the ability to
remove preexisting deposits from the engine during
engine operation. Among the many additives which have been
developed for this purpose, Group II metal overbased
sulfurized alkylphenate compositions have been found
to be highly effective detergent/dispersants for use
in lubricating oils. Furthermore, these additives
are excellent oxidation and corrosion inhibitors
and, by virtue of their alkalinity reserve, have the
ability to neutralize acidic combustion and
oxidation products. Such acidic products form
during engine operation, particularly when operated
on high sulfur containing fuels, and tend to
accumulate in the lubricating oil. The ability of
Group II metal overbased sulfurized alkylphenate
compositions to neutralize such acidic products can
be directly measured by determining the total base
number (TBN) of the composition. Higher TBNs
reflect a greater capacity for these compositions to
neutralize acids generated during engine operation.The preparation of Group II metal
overbased sulfurized alkylphenate compositions is
well known in the art and is described in detail in,
for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,178,368; 3,367,867;
and 4,744,921, each of which is incorporated herein
by reference in its entirety. Typically, such
Group II metal overbased sulfurized alkylphenate
compositions are prepared by treating alkyphenol in
a suitable diluent (e.g., a lubricating oil) with an
amount of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, oxide
and/or alkoxide in excess of that necessary to
neutralize the phenol and then sulfurizing the
resulting product optionally in the
