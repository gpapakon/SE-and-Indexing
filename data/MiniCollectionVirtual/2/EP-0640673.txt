<ABSTRACT>
A wallpaper provided with a dry adhesive layer. The 
adhesive layer consists of a non-sticky, cold-adhesive glue 

which is bondable to an adhesive layer of a similar adhesive 
applied to a substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for applying a
wallpaper to a substrate, such as a wall or partition,
comprising the steps of
applying a layer of an adhesive to a substrateapplying a layer of a similar adhesive to a wallpaper andapplying the wallpaper to the thus prepared substrate.With the commonly used method of applying wallpaper to
a substrate, usually a wall or partition, a considerable
number of drawbacks are associated. Usually, the wallpaper is
supplied in rolled-up strips having a length of ten meters
and a width of approximately half a meter, and is unrolled
shortly before applying it and provided, on the back side
thereof, with a layer of glue on a water base. The wallpaper
should be held at least at the ends thereof, as the strip
tends to return into the rolled-up condition. The strip
provided with a layer of glue is applied to a wall and
pressed. Subsequently, a next strip is pasted on the wall,
next to and against the previous strip. If this strip did not
end up in the correct position, it can be pulled loose again
carefully. However, due to the application of a glue on a
water base, the wallpaper has become weak, as a result of
which it tears easily.When being applied, the wallpaper, having become weak,
stretches slightly, while it shrinks again during drying.
This causes slits between the adjoining strips of wallpaper.
It is true that this can be prevented by pasting the edge of
one strip of wallpaper slightly over the edge of the previous
strip, but this is often undesired for aesthetic reasons, in
particular if the wallpaper has a continuous pattern. Hence,
such a type of wallpaper is usually manufactured from a
thicker layer of paper, which stretches less easily. When a wet, soft wallpaper, applied to a wall and
provided with a relief impressed into the wallpaper
(gauffrage), is pressed by means of a brush, the result is
often that the relief is largely pressed flat and lost. To
prevent this, such types of wallpaper have been manufactured
from two (glue-)coated layers of paper (duplex paper).Smearing a layer of glue over a recurling strip of
wallpaper, holding the smeared strip of wallpaper and
applying it to a wall is usually considered a "dirty" job.Attempts have been made to facilitate wallpapering by
marketing types of wallpaper provided, on the back sides
thereof, with a dry layer of adhesive or glue. By passing the
roll of wallpaper through a tray of water, the layer of glue
was activated and after a specific swelling period the strip
of wallpaper was ready for being applied.

Method for applying a wallpaper to a substrate, such
as a wall or partition, comprising the steps of


applying a layer of an adhesive to a substrate
applying a layer of a similar adhesive to a wallpaper and
applying the wallpaper to the thus prepared substrate,

characterized in that

both adhesive layers consist of a non-sticky, cold adhesive
glue, which in a dry condition is exclusively bondable to a

similar type of adhesive,
the wallpaper being provided with the adhesive in a
preparatory process step, in which the adhesive is applied

in a wet condition and subsequently dried,
said wallpaper being applied to the substrate in a dry,
non-moistened condition, with only a slight pressure.
