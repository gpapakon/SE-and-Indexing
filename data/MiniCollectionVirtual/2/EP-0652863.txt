<ABSTRACT>
Non-peptidic Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) surrogates of formula (I), wherein X1 to X5 are the same or different C, N, O or S atoms, at least two of them being C, and the X1-X5 chain may be optionally substituted by radicals selected from halogen, hydrocarbyl, oxo, thioxo, amino and carboxyl, or the X1-X5 chain or part thereof may form part of a heterocyclic ring, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, inhibit cellular or molecular interactions which depend on recognition of the LDV sequence, and are useful for the treatment of inflammation and disorders involving interference with cell-matrix or cell-cell dependent immune processes, such as autoimmune diseases and allergy, and inhibition of tumour progression and metastasis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-PEPTIDIC SURROGATES OF THE LDV SEQUENCE AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION, AUTOIfWUNE DISEASES AND TUMOUR PROGRESSIONField and Background of the InventionThe present invention relates to novel Leu-Asp-VaL (LDV) surrogates, to their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them for treatment of several disorders.The ability of blood cells to adhere to and to interact with other cells or with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is fundamental for maintaining cell function and tissue integrity through signals delivered between and within the communicating cells. Cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesive interactions are regulated primarily by a super family of cell adhesion receptors, the integrins, which are widespread on most cell types including lymphocytes, tumor cells and platelets.The integrins are heterodimeric molecules consisting of an alpha (α) and a beta (β) subunits which are non-covalently linked. Eleven ct and six β subunits have been identified. The pairing of and β subunits may be cell-type specific and determines ligand specificity.The integrins play an important role in linking the ECM with the intercellular actin-containing cytoskeleto : the extracellular portion mediates the binding of adhesive proteins, and the intracellular portion interacts with elements of the cytoskeleton.The exit of cells from blood vessels and their ensuing tissue localization depends on receptor-mediated recognition of endothelial cells, their basement membranes and the ECM. The ability of various cell types to recognize and attach to components of the ECM may therefore be considered as an essential physiological feature of homeostasis .Fibronectin (FN), a well characterized ECM-derived cell-adhesive glycoprotein, is present in a variety of-1- 

matrices and is synthesized and secreted by a variety of cell types as a 230-250 kDa cross-linked dimer composed of three types of internal repeats: I, II, and III. FN is involved in processes that include wound healing, embryonic cell migration and differentiation, cell activation, prolifer¬ ation, and adhesion . Cell binding to immobilized FN is mediated primarily by surface integrins of the βi (CD29; very late antigens (VLA) )-subfamily of receptors, including VLA-3, -4 and -5 . The interaction of FN with these integrins relies on its central cell-binding domain and depends on the cell adhesion motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which is recognized primarily by the α5βι (VTiA-5) integrin . Nevertheless, additional adhesion epitopes on the
