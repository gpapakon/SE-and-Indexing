<ABSTRACT>
A heater attachment for an evaporative cooler having an axial airflow fan (10), in which the airflow is divided by an element mount (18) into an inner airflow in alignment with the hub area of the fan, and an outer airflow surrounding the inner airflow. The element mount (18) has an annular bearing wall with bearing surface, and finger sets (19) rotate on the bearing surface to function as shutters to obstruct the outer airflow when element (32) is energised, and by reducing total airflow, the heated inner airflow is at a higher, more comfortable temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in an evaporative cooler of the
axial flow type, whereby a heater attachment can supply slow moving air
heated to a comfortable temperature.Attempts have been made previously to attach heating elements to
evaporative coolers so that a cold occupied space can be heated, but a
difficulty is encountered in that the temperature rise is very small because of
the large amount of air which passes over the heating elements, and although
the occupied space temperature will gradually increase, the fast moving air in
passing over the human body will not give the illusion of warming the body,
since it is essentially colder than the body heat and the velocity is a significant
factor in cooling of the body. For that reason the previous attempts known to
have been made by the applicant have been generally regarded as unsuccessful,
and this invention is directed to providing a means whereby a reduced velocity
of warmer air can be introduced over a heating element in a device normally
used for evaporative cooling.Australian Patent No. AU-B-4173/40 discloses an evaporative cooler in
which a heater element is placed in an area of the cooler where a high velocity
of air and high volume of air can pass over the elements. This arrangement
does not give rise to an illusion of warming the body due to the velocity of air
flow over the body from the cooler.One of the characteristics of a cooler fan of the axial flow type is that
there is much less air flowing from the hub area of the fain than from the outer
flow in the annulus which surrounds the hub, and this invention seeks to take
advantage of that characteristic.Thus in the invention as claimed in claim 1, a heating element is inserted in
the space downstream of a fan of a cooler and in an inner air flow from the hub
area of the fan, and there is provided means to obstruct the annular surrounding
the hub area.In this invention, air from an axial flow fan in an evaporative cooler is 
divided by an element mount into an inner air flow in alignment with the hub
area of the fan, and an outer air flow surrounding the inner air flow. The
element mount is an annular bearing wall having an outer bearing surface, and
finger sets rotate on the bearing surface to function as shutters to obstruct the
outer air flow when the element is energised, and by reducing total air flow, the
heated inner air flow is at a higher, more comfortable temperature.An embodiment is described hereunder with reference to and is
illustrated in the accompanying drawings

<CLAIMS>
An evaporative cooler comprising a motor and an axial flow fan
(10) assembly with fan blades radiating from a central hub (11), securing means

(33) securing element mounting means (18) in axial alignment with, and
downstream of, said hub (11), an electrical heating element (32) carried by the

mounting means (18), said heating element (32) having passages for
substantially unobstructed inner through-flow of air from an inner area of said

fan (10) adjacent said hub,

shutter means (13) also downstream of said hub, and shutter control
means (14) coupled to said shutter means (13) for moving said shutter means (13) between an open and closed

positions whereby an outer flow of air from an outer area of said fan (10)
surrounding said inner area is respectively unobstructed, and obstructed.
A cooler according to claim 1 wherein said element mounting
means (18) comprises a wall which divides said inner air flow from said outer

air flow.
A cooler according to claim 1 further comprising a circular fan
shroud (24) surrounding said fan blades (10), said element mounting means (18)

having an annular bearing wall co-axial with, and of smaller diameter than, said
shroud (24),


said securing means (33) comprising a plurality of struts extending
outwardly from said annular wall (18) and joining said annular wall (18) to said

shroud (24),
said shutter means (13) comprising at least one finger set (19) carried by
said annular wall (18) and having a plurality of shutter fingers (23) extending

outwardly from said annular wall (18), and movable between said open position
wherein said fingers (23) are in axial alignment with said struts (33), and a

closed position wherein said fingers (23) are between said struts (33), and co-operate
with said struts (33) to obstruct said outer air flow.
A cooler according to claim 3 wherein an outer surface of said
annular wall (18) comprises a bearing surface, and a plurality of said finger sets

(19) each having a hub portion (22) rotatable on said wall (18), the outer ends
of said fingers (23) being contiguous with an inner surface of said shroud (24) 

at its downstream end.
A cooler according to claim 3 further comprising a plurality of said
finger sets (19) each having a hub (22) rotatable about said annular wall (18),

said fingers (23) extending outwardly from said hub (22), the first of a pair of
adjacent said hubs (22) having surfaces defining a circumferential slot (27), and

another of said hubs (22) having an extending projection (26) which is movable
within a said slot (27) and engageable against an end thereof, the slot length

being such that rotation of said other of hubs (22) between said open and
closed positions also controls rotation of said first of said hubs (22).
A cooler according to claim 3 wherein each said strut (33) has an
upstream aerofoil portion (30).
A cooler according to claim 1 further comprising a switch (34) in a
power circuit of said electrical heating element (32), and a surface on said

shutter control means (14) which so co-operates with said switch (34) as to
effect energising of said element (32) only when said shutters are closed.
A cooler according to claim 3 wherein said shutter control means
(14) comprises a movable control member, a said finger set (19) comprises

surfaces in a finger (23) thereof defining a slot (27), and said control member
(14) has a projection (26) thereon engaging said finger slot (27) to cause partial

rotation of said finger set (19) upon movement of said control member (14).
