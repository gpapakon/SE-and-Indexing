<ABSTRACT>
A plasma torch is designed for energy supply for example for chemical processes. The plasma torch comprises at least three solid tubular electrodes (1, 2 and 3) located coaxially inside one another. The electrodes (1, 2, 3) can be moved axially in relation to one another. They are preferably electrically insulated (5, 6, 7) from one another and have connections for electrical power (8, 9, 10). When three electrodes are used, the middle electrode (2) is used as an auxiliary electrode or ignition electrode. It is then coupled with one of the other electrodes (1). The distance to third electrode (3) is adapted to the working voltage in such a way that a jump spark is obtained when the working voltage is connected. During operation the auxiliary electrode (2) is withdrawn from the plasma zone thus preventing it from continuously forming the foot point of the arc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a plasma torch preferably for
energy supply for chemical processes. The plasma torch is
provided with several tubular electrodes which are located
coaxially with one another. The electrodes are connected to an
electrical power supply. Gas is supplied through the internal
electrode and in the spaces between the electrodes. High
temperature plasma is formed by means of the gas which is
heated by the electric arc which extends between the
electrodes.GB-A-1 227 179 discloses a plasma torch device
with a central electrode and up to three coaxially tubular
watercooled bushings surrounding it. The plasma torch is of
the transferred type where the arc is established between the
central electrode and a working piece outside the torch which
acts as an electrode. The central electrode and the bushings
are made of metal and are electrically insulated from another.
Gas is supplied through the annular openings between the
electrode and the bushings. The tubular bushings can be used
as electrodes but are connected to the power source only
intermittently to discharge an arc in the torch during the
starting operation and during the shifting of the arc to
temporarily interrupt an operation without extinguishing that
arc.In order to obtain desired chemical reactions in gases or in
mixtures of gas and liquid or solid particles, in some cases
energy has to be supplied. Some such chemical reactions in
gases take place at extremely high temperatures, in the order
of 1000 to 3000 degrees. It is also necessary to be able to
check the amount and the temperature of the gas in order to be
able to control and regulate a chemical process of this kind.
By exploiting the technology of heating gas in an electric arc
in a plasma torch the above-mentioned requirements can be
achieved.The plasma torches known hitherto have been used first and
foremost for heating gas for the purpose of welding and cutting 
steel, for heating in metallurgical processes and in laboratory
experiments. Since they often have a high consumption of plasma
gas, as it is the gas transport through the torch which dissipates
the heat generated in the arc, in some applications
they will be less favourable from the point of view of heat
economy.The object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a
plasma torch which has good heat economy, long electrode life
and an operationally reliable design which is suitable for
industrial application.This object is achieved with a plasma torch which is
characterized by the features in the

energy supply for example for chemical processes, wherein the

plasma torch comprises several tubular electrodes located
coaxially inside one another, wherein the electrodes are

electrically insulated from one another, have connections for
electrical power and can be connected to alternating or direct

current, and are equipped with an axial magnetic field in the
arc's operational area, wherein the electrodes are composed of

a non-metallic material with a high melting point, and wherein
plasma-forming gas and/or reactant can be supplied through the

central electrode and in the annular spaces between the
electrodes, wherein

there are used at least three electrodes

electrode (2) and central electrode (3), wherein the electrodes
(1, 2 and 3) can be moved axially in relation to one another

and wherein the auxiliary electrode (2) constitutes an ignition
electrode which is electrically connected to one of the other

electrodes (1, 3) so that these two electrodes (2, 1) or (2, 3)
in operation have the same polarity and voltage, and wherein

the auxiliary electrode (2) can be withdrawn from the plasma

auxiliary electrode (2) from the plasma zone so that the

current through it is at a minimum.
A plasma torch according to claim 1,

characterized in that the radial distance between the auxiliary
electrode (2) connected to one pole and the electrode (1 or 3)

connected to the other pole in the power supply is so
dimensioned that an electrical spark jumps between them when

the working voltage is connected.
