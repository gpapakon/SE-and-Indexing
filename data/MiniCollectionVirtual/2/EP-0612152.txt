<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a level shift circuit 
which drops the output voltage of the prior stage circuit to 
an input voltage level of the next stage circuit, more 
particularly, to a level shift circuit which suppresses the 
variation in the level shift amount caused by the variations 
of the device characteristics of a source follower 
enhancement type field effect transistor (hereinafter 
referred to as FET). Figure 4 is a diagram showing a circuit construction of 
a prior art level shift circuit. In figure 4, reference 
numeral 500 designates a level shift circuit. A drain of a 
source follower enhancement type FET 1(Q1) is connected to a 
positive power supply 30, and a gate thereof is connected to 
an input terminal 10 to which an output signal of the prior 
stage circuit is input, and a source thereof is connected to 
the anode of the level shift diode 2. A constant current 
source 3 is connected between the cathode of the level shift 
diode 2 and the negative power supply 40 and an output 
terminal 20 is taken out from the connection node of the 
cathode of the level shift diode 2 and one end of the 
constant current source 3, thus constituting a level shift 
circuit.  
 Here, while in the above example the level shift diode 
2 comprises two diodes D1 and D2 connected in series to each 
other, the number of diodes is not restricted thereto and 
can be determined in accordance with the voltage to be 
dropped. In addition, the constant current source 3 is 
constituted by a depletion FET having its gate and its 
source connected with each other. A description is given of an operation hereinafter. When it is supposed that a current which is made to 
flow through the level shift circuit 500 by the constant 
current source 3 is Iconst and that a source follower 
enhancement type FET 1 is operated at the saturation region, 
the level shift amount Vgs between its gate and its source, 
is represented by the following formula (1). 
Vgs = IconstK + Vth 
here, 
K : gain coefficient of the enhancement type FET 
1(Q1)  Vth: threshold voltage of the enhancement type FET 
1(Q1)   From the equation (1), by setting the current Iconst 
flowing through the constant current source 3 to an 
appropriate value, the level shift amount Vgs at the source 
follower enhancement type FET 1(Q1) is determined. The  
 
reason why he enhancement type FET 1(Q1) is employed for 
the source follower FET is because the enhancement type FET 
an produce a desired level shift amount by a less current 
Iconst than that of the
