<ABSTRACT>
[OBJECT] To provide an intended product of high quality 

at low production costs in a yield higher than in 
ordinary processes by using an inexpensive catalyst or a 

catalyst which can be readily recovered. 
[ARRANGEMENT] A process for preparing 

2-acetylamino-6-chloropurine comprises suspending 
2,9-diacetylguanine or 2-acetylguanine in a polar inert 

solvent, reacting with phosphorus oxychloride in the 
presence of a water-insoluble tertiary amine and either 

ammonium chloride or a hydrochloride of the tertiary 
amine, and hydrolyzing the resultant reaction product to 

obtain 2-acetylamino-6-chloropurine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
preparing 2-acetylamino-6-chloropurine which is well
known as an intermediate having wide utility in the field
of synthesis of nucleosides in the pharmaceutical
industry.2-Acetylamino-6-chloropurine has been hitherto
prepared according to the processes set forth, for
example, in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
4-234883, International Laid-open Patent Application Nos.
WO92/13859, WO93/15075 and European Laid-open Patent Application EP
0590361A1. In these processes, 2,9-diacetylguanine or
2-acetylguanine is reacted with a halogenating agent
using, as a catalyst, a quaternary ammonium salt such as
tetraethylammonium chloride, triethylmethylammonium
chloride or benzyltriethylammonium chloride, or a
triethylamine hydrochloride and a tertiary amine,
followed by hydrolysis to obtain intended
2-acetylamino-6-chloropurine.However, the catalysts used in the above
processes are expensive and are difficult to recover.
With the industrial preparation, costs for starting
materials become high, resulting in inconvenient high 
production costs.It is accordingly an object of the invention to
provide a process for preparing
2-acetylamino-6-chloropurine which overcomes the problem
involved in the prior art processes.It is another object of the invention to
provide a process for preparing
2-acetylamino-6-chloropurine which makes use of catalysts
which are inexpensive or which can be readily recovered
whereby production costs can be conveniently reduced,
with an intended product of high quality being obtained
at a yield higher than in prior art counterparts. * The
above objects can be achieved, according to the invention,
by a process which comprises suspending
2,9-diacetylguanine or 2-acetylguanine (N2-acetylguanine)
in a polar inert solvent, reacting the
2,9-diacetylguanine or 2-acetylguanine with phosphorus
oxychloride as a halogenating agent
in the presence of a catalyst which consists
of a combination of a water-insoluble
tertiary amine and ammonium chloride or a combination of
a water-insoluble tertiary amine and a hydrochloride
thereof, and subjecting the resulting reaction product to
hydrolysis to obtain 2-acetyiamino-6-chloropurine.According to the invention as claimed this tertiary amine is selected from the group
tripopylamine, tributylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline and N,N-diethylaniline. Preferably, the process of the invention
comprises: 
suspending 2,9-diacetylguanine or
2-acetylguanine in a polar inert solvent such as, for
example, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran
