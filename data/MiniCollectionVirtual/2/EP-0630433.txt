<ABSTRACT>
In a method of and machine for forming a non-woven bias yarn assembly (10) comprising two superposed non-woven bias yarn sub-assemblies, each yarn (11, 12) is transferred by a yarn transfer member (22) from an opening it occupies in a yarn guide member (21) to another opening in the yarn guide member (21) in such a manner that each yarn (11, 12) is caused in a succession of forward transfer steps to follow the yarn preceding it from one opening to another along a non-intersecting path until the yarn (11, 12) at a first end opening in the path arrives at a second end opening in the path located at the opposite end of the path and the yarn (11, 12) at the second end opening in the path arrives at the first end opening and then in a succession of return transfer steps to follow the yarn preceding it from one opening to another along the non-intersecting path in the opposite direction until the yarn (11, 12) from the second end opening in the path arrives at the first end opening and the yarn (11, 12) from the first end opening arrives at the second end opening. The forward and return transfer steps are then successively repeated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multi-axial yarn
structures and is particularly although not exclusively
concerned with a method of and machine for forming a
three dimensional multi-axial yarn structure which
embodies an assembly of bias yarns formed by two or more
superposed non-woven bias yarn sub-assemblies in which
the bias yarns of one sub-assembly are inclined to the
bias yarns of the other sub-assembly and in both of which
the bias yarns are inclined to a warp feed direction of
the structure being formed.By yarn is meant a continuous monofilament, an assembly
of continuous filaments in the form of a tow or twisted
together or a yarn spun from short fibres.By warp feed direction is meant the direction in which
warp yarns are fed and which is orthogonal to weft yarns
in the structure being formed.In EP 0263392-A2 there is disclosed a machine for forming
a tetra-axial woven fabric embodying warp yarns, weft
yarns and a bias yarn assembly having two bias yarn sub-assemblies
in which the bias yarns of each are inclined
to the bias yarns of the other and to the warp and weft
yarns. In one form of fabric produced, the bias yarn
sub-assemblies are arranged between the warp and weft
yarns and the warp yarns are woven with the weft yarns to
hold the intermediate bias yarns in place in the fabric.
The machine includes a bias yarn traversing device for
progressively traversing yarns fed to it to provide the
sub-assemblies of oppositely inclined bias yarns which
are fed into the weaving zone where the warp yarns are
woven with the weft yarns. Three different forms of bias yarn traversing device are
disclosed in EP0263392-A2. In a first form, two contra-rotating
guide rolls are arranged one above the other.
Each roll is provided with a helical groove by means of
which yarns fed to the device are progressively traversed
first along one of the rolls in a first weft direction
and then along the other roll in an opposite weft
direction and means are provided for transferring each
yarn on its arrival at the end of one roll to the
adjacent end of the other roll. In a second form of the
bias yarn traversing device, an endless belt is provided
having an upper horizontal run in which the belt moves in
a first weft direction and a lower horizontal run in
which the belt moves in an opposite weft direction. The
belt is provided with spaced outwardly projecting guide
pins along its length, which define openings through
which yarns are fed and which guide the yarns so that the
yarns in the upper run are traversed in one
