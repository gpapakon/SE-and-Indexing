<ABSTRACT>
An ambient air cooled high intensity light emitting instrument (10) in 
which the lamp (40) is contained in a heat sink (30) mounted within a 

housing (12). The housing contains a plurality of vent holes (17) which 
circumscribe the heat sink. As heat from the light is conducted along the 

heat sink when the instrument is in use, the heat emanates into the chamber 
surrounding the heat sink, and rises through the vent holes to the surrounding 

atmosphere, generating a thermal current which replaces the departing hot air 
with cooler air from the atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to light emitting instruments 
and, in particular, to an improved ambient air cooled high intensity light 
emitting instrument. Many opportunities for visual inspection require prolonged 
continuous use of light in order to adequately illuminate the area to be 
inspected. Hand held medical and dental light sources which provide 
illumination for inspection or examination are well known and have been 
utilized for many years. Specific examples of such devices include 
ophthalmascopes, otoscopes, retinoscopes, and other similar instruments. In 
these hand held devices, the handle generally houses the light source. It is 
advantageous to mount the lamp within the instrument rather than in a 
remote location, requiring the use of additional transmission means such as 
fiber optics, to direct the light to the desired location. Although a remote light 
source is easy to cool, it usually results in a relatively inflexible fiber optic 
cable, significantly limiting the maneuverability of the instrument and 
increasing the overall cost of the instrument. Recently, high intensity light sources, such as halogen or krypton gas 
filled lamps have been developed to provide significantly more light for hand 
held dental and medical instruments. This increase in light intensity, often  
 
two to three times greater than that provided by ordinary vacuum lamps of 
the same size, greatly improves the performance of these instruments. In 
addition, vacuum lamps progressively deteriorate in both quantity and 
quality of light emission as the lamp ages due to tungsten particles which are 
deposited on the envelope of the lamp. A halogen lamp however, provides a 
reasonably consistent quantity and quality of light emission over its life, due 
in part to the extreme lamp skin temperature (250 - 300Â°C) which causes 
tungsten particles deposited on the envelope of the lamp to vaporize and 
redeposit on the tungsten filament. Unfortunately, this extreme heat generated by high intensity lamps can 
often lead to other problems for hand held instruments. Obviously, heat 
buildup within the handle will cause discomfort to the user of the 
instrument. This problem becomes exaggerated as the duty cycle for the 
instrument increases. Some dental or surgical procedures require a hand 
held instrument to be used continuously for extended periods of time, such as 
an hour or more. Other heat related problems inherent in these instruments 
include accelerated deterioration of the lamp and instrument
