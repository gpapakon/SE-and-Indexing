<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for bonding 
or adhering substrates using a silicone rubber 
composition comprised of a thermal-crosslinking 
component and a moisture-crosslinking component. The 
present invention also achieves silicone rubber bonding 
methods that are capable of substantially reducing the 
setting time and firmly bonding the substrates. Moisture-crosslinking silicone rubber 
compositions crosslink at room temperature under the 
action of atmospheric moisture. When such compositions 
are crosslinked and cured while in contact with a 
substrate, they yield a silicone rubber that tightly 
bonds a variety of substrates. As a result, moisture-crosslinking 
silicone rubber compositions are used for 
adhesion applications in the very broadest range of 
industrial fields. For for example, they are used in 
the construction industry for adhering window glass to 
aluminum frames, for adhering window glass to window 
glass, and for adhering tile and mortar; in the 
automotive industry for sealing oil pans to engine 
bodies, for bonding electrical circuit components on 
substrates, for bonding lamp bodies with lamp glass, 
and for bonding automotive glass to the automobile 
body; and in electrical/electronic sectors for adhering 
electronic circuit components to substrates. Moisture-crosslinking silicone rubber 
compositions are exemplified by silicone rubber 
compositions comprised of silanol-terminated 
polydiorganosiloxane, curing catalyst, and 
organotrialkoxysilane, organotriacetoxysilane, or 
organotrioximosilane, and by silicone rubber 
compositions comprised of trialkoxysiloxy-terminated 
polydiorganosiloxane, curing catalyst, and 
organotrialkoxysilane, organotriacetoxysilane, or  
 
organotrioximosilane. Such compositions are taught in 
JP-A 61-247756 [247,756/1986] and JP-A 62-252456 
[252,456/1987], both assigned to the same assignee as 
the present application. However, crosslinking in moisture-crosslinking 
silicone rubber compositions develops from 
those regions in contact with atmospheric moisture, and 
as a result long periods of time are required for 
crosslinking in deep sections. This requirement for 
long setting times is a drawback associated with the 
use of this type of composition in continuous processes 
for bonding two substrates. The setting time is the 
time required for crosslinking to develop to such a 
degree that the adherends can tolerate transport and 
other handling for transfer to ensuing processes. In contrast, thermal-crosslinking silicone 
rubber
