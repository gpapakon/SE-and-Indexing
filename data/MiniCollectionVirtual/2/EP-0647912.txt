<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for time-based games and/or semi-interactive 
activities, characterized in that it 

comprises: 

multiple user apparatuses provided with 
display means, microprocessor means, keyboard means, 

and an absolute clock; 
 
management apparatus for use by a company 
controlling and conducting semi-interactive activities 

with the owners of said user apparatuses;

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
time-based games and/or semi-interactive activities. More particularly, according to a first 
embodiment, the present invention relates to an 
apparatus for time-based games and/or semi-interactive 
activities correlated with radio and television type 
transmissions, based on the use of "time windows" 
connected to phenomena associated with an absolute 
time. From common experience, programmes of the radio or 
television type are known that are based on "quizzes", 
lotteries or other games with prizes which are 
addressed to the listeners and/or viewers, during which 
it is necessary to reply "live" within a certain period 
of time indicated by the person presenting the program. Usually, these systems are organized on the basis 
of telephone-based interactive activity, that is to say 
a listener or viewer who wishes to take part in the 
game must call the presenter on the telephone and then 
reply, usually within a specified length of time, to 
the various questions or operations in the game, which 
normally ends with a prize or the offer of consumable 
goods. In these cases, only those who manage to get 
through on the telephone are able to take part. This 
fact is a serious limitation as, in particularly 
popular transmissions, merely managing to get the line 
and pass through the filter of telephone operators is 
in a sense a question of "good luck". In this way, 
participation in the radio or television quiz programme 
can of necessity only involve an extremely limited 
number of listeners or viewers. In other cases, the 
radio listener or television viewer is merely invited 
to fill in and post a pre-printed or conventional 
postcard, which must be sent to the organizer, whether  
 
this be the radio or television station itself or the 
sponsor, thus involving an enormous amount of post and 
furthermore the total uncertainty of the listener or 
viewer taking part in the game as to whether or not he 
has replied correctly to the question. In fact, 
programmes of this kind often take place on a once-a-week 
basis, thus losing the element of interest based 
on knowing immediately whether or not a participant has 
won. Again in the case of radio or television 
programmes with telephone-type interaction, using the 
apparatus according to the present invention, the only 
people who might be interested in telephoning are those 
who have picked the correct reply, thus reducing the 
number of telephone calls. In the case of postcard-based competitions also,

display means, microprocessor means, keyboard means, 

and an absolute clock; 
management apparatus for use by a company 
controlling and conducting semi-interactive activities 

with the owners of said user apparatuses; 
a first information communication channel 
connected to said absolute clock, said channel being 

unidirectional from company to user; 
a second information communication channel 
differing from said first channel in that it is from 

user to company, for transfer of information correlated 
to the time supplied by said clock, and of information 

received from said user and associated to further 
information supplied by the user to said user 

apparatus. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said first channel is made up of 

a direct communication from the user apparatus to the 
user himself. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said first channel is a mass 

media means. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said first channel is a 

television or radio transmission. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said first channel is formed by 

indicator boards associated with large-scale spectator 
events. 
An apparatus according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said second 

channel is a postal communication means. 
An apparatus according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said second 

channel is a telephone communication means. 
An apparatus according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said user and 

organizer apparatus comprise program means to generate 
time windows within which to perform an operation 

connected to an event and to the time supplied by said 
absolute clock.
