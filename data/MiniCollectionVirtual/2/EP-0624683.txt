<ABSTRACT>
A method for dyeing polyester fibers by using a 
disperse dye, wherein said dyeing is conducted under an 

alkaline condition in an aqueous medium in the presence 
of 1 ○ at least one amino acid member selected from the 

group consisting of an amino acid, an amino acid 
derivative having at least one hydrogen atom of its amino 

group replaced with an organic group, and a salt of such 
an amino acid or amino acid derivative, and 2 ○ at least 

one polycarboxylic acid or a salt thereof selected from 
the group consisting of ethylenediamine having at least 

two hydrogen atoms of its amino group replaced with a 
-RCOOH group (R means a C₁₋₃ alkylene group) and a salt 

thereof; polyethylenepolyamine having at least two 
hydrogen atoms of its amino group or imino group replaced 

with a -RCOOH group (R means the same as defined above) 
and a salt thereof; and nitrilotriacetic acid, 

nitrilotripropionic acid, iminodiacetic acid, 
iminodipropionic acid, β-hydroxyethyl-iminodiacetic acid, 

β-hydroxyethyl-iminodipropionic acid and salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for dyeing 
polyester fibers by means of a disperse dye by an 
exhaustion method under an alkaline condition in an 
aqueous medium in good reproducibility while preventing 
the decomposition of the disperse dye, and showing good 
scouring effect (especially desizing effect). It is common to conduct dyeing of polyester fibers by 
means of a disperse dye in a weakly acidic dyeing bath 
(pH 5 to 7) at a temperature of from 120 to 140°C, 
because the disperse dye is unstable in an alkaline 
dyeing bath, and it is difficult under an alkaline 
condition to dye polyester fibers with a constant color 
tone with good reproducibility. On the other hand, when the dyeing of polyester 
fibers is conducted under an alkaline condition, it is 
known that: 1 ○a trouble (such as tarring or blooming) 
caused by the precipitated oligomer as observed in the 
case of dyeing under an acidic condition can be  
 
prevented, since the polyester oligomer precipitating in 
the dyeing bath from the interior of the fibers under the 
dyeing condition will dissolve in an alkaline dyeing 
bath, 2 ○ a sizing agent such as polyacrylic acid ester 
type or polyvinyl alcohol type used in a spinning or 
weaving step can be removed. In such an alkaline condition dyeing, it is necessary 
to use a disperse dye having relatively high alkali 
resistance, but when the temperature of the dyeing bath 
is raised to 120 to 140°C, the disperse dye is decomposed 
and dyeing can not be conducted with good dyeing 
reproducibility. To solve the above problem, a method whereby a 
certain amino acid or a derivative thereof is 
incorporated to the dyeing bath is proposed (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 229283/1990). This 
method is preferable with a view to preventing the 
decomposition of the disperse dye used in the exhaustion 
method under an alkaline condition in an aqueous medium 
with good dyeing reproducibility, while it is not 
satisfactory from the viewpoint of scouring effect 
because of insufficient desizing effect. Under these circumstances, the present inventors have 
conducted extensive studies for a dyeing method to 
improve the desizing effect during the exhaustion dyeing 
of polyester fibers by means of a disperse dye under an 
alkaline condition and in the presence of a certain amino  
 
acid or a derivative thereof. As a result, they have 
found that by incorporating a specific polycarboxylic 
acid and a salt thereof to the dyeing bath, the sizing 
agent can be effectively removed,
