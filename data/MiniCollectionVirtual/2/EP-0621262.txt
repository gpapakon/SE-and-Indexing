<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of alkyl 3-chloroanthranilates, by reacting 3-chloroanthranilic acid with 0.8 to 5 parts by weight of phosgene in an inert solvent and reacting the resulting 3-chloroisatoic anhydride with an alkanol, if appropriate in the presence of an esterification catalyst, to give the alkyl 3-chloroanthranilate.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 3-chloroanthranilic alkyl 
esters, which comprises reacting 3-chloroanthranilic 

acid, in an inert solvent, with from 0.8 to 5 parts 
by weight of phosgene, and reacting the 3-chloroisatoic 

anhydride which is formed with an alkanol, 
where appropriate in the presence of an 

esterification catalyst, to give the 3-chloroanthranilic 
alkyl ester. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein an aromatic 
hydrocarbon, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon, 

or mixtures thereof, is/are employed as the 
inert solvent. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
and 2, wherein toluene, a xylene, a mixture of 

xylene isomers, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene 
and/or a chlorotoluene is employed as the inert 

solvent. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein from 4 to 20, in particular from 8 to 12, 

parts by weight of inert solvent are employed for 
each part by weight of 3-chloroanthranilic acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein from 0.8 to 5, in particular from 1.6 to 

3.1, parts by weight of phosgene are employed for 
each part by weight of 3-chloroanthranilic acid.  

 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein 3-chloroanthranilic acid is reacted, in 

a first step, with from 0.5 to 3 parts by weight of 
phosgene for each part by weight of 3-chloroanthranilic 

acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
6, wherein 3-chloroanthranilic acid is reacted, in 

the first step, with from 1 to 2 parts by weight of 
phosgene for each part by weight of 3-chloroanthranilic 

acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
7, wherein 3-chloroanthranilic acid is reacted, in 

the first step, with phosgene at from 5 to 50°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
8, wherein 3-chloroanthranilic acid is reacted, in 

the first step, with phosgene at from 15 to 35°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
9, wherein the reaction product resulting from the 

first step is reacted, in a second step, with from 
0.3 to 2 parts by weight of phosgene for each part 

by weight of 3-chloroanthranilic acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
10, wherein the reaction product is reacted, in the 

second step, with from 0.6 to 1.1 parts by weight of 
phosgene for each part by weight of 3-chloroanthranilic 

acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
11, wherein the reaction product is reacted, in the 

second step, with phosgene at from 80 to 140°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
12, wherein the reaction product is reacted, in the 

second step, with phosgene at from 90 to 120°C.  
 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein 3-chloroanthranilic acid is reacted with 

phosgene in a single step at from 80 to 120, in particular 
from 90 to 110, °C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
14, wherein the 3-chloroisatoic anhydride is reacted 

with an alkanol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
15, wherein from 1 to 20, in particular from 2 to 

10, parts by weight of alkanol are employed for each 
part by weight of 3-chloroisatoic anhydride. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
16, wherein the 3-chloroisatoic anhydride is reacted 

with the alkanol at from 5 to 90°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
17, wherein the 3-chloroisatoic anhydride is reacted 

with the alkanol at from 15 to 75°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
18, wherein a basic compound, in particular a hydroxide, 

carbonate and/or hydrogen carbonate of an 
alkali metal, preferably of sodium and/or potassium, 

is employed as the esterification catalyst. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
19, wherein from 0.01 to 0.8, in particular from 0.1 

to 0.5, of an equivalent of esterification catalyst 
is employed for each equivalent of 3-chloroisatoic 

anhydride.
