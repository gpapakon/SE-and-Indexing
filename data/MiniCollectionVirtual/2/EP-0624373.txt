<ABSTRACT>
To combat disorders in which Helicobacter pylori is involved, a combination product which is composed of amoxycillin and bismuth and which displays significantly better efficacy than treatment with a bismuth salt alone has been developed. It is possible by a suitable combination of the ancillary substances to produce a stable, small, hard tablet which can be swallowed as a whole and which contains as auxiliaries preferably polyvinylpyrrolidone, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, magnesium stearate and colloidal silica.
