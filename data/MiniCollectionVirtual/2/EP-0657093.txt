A seeder unit (10) with a seed receiving zone, a seed holding zone (68), a seed discharge zone
(74) and selector fingers (30) rotating ab
out an axis of rotation and which are forced
in the longitudinal direction such that they effect reception of a single seed in

the receiving zone, retain the received seed in the holding zone (68) and effect the emergence of
the seed into an outlet (16) in the discharge zone, characterized in that the longitudinal axes of the

selector fingers (30) are arranged coaxial with their axis of rotation.
A seeder unit according to claim 1, with a disc part (24) receiving the selector fingers (30),
characterized in that a disc (26) rotating with the disc part (24) is provided spaced from the disc

part (24) and in that the selector fingers (30) are so forcibly controlled that they are movable
during their circulation towards and away from the disc (26).
A seeder unit according to claim 2, characterized in that the disc (26) is provided with seed cells
(52) which are aligned with the selector fingers (30).
A seeder unit according to claim 3, characterized in that each seed cell (52) is covered by a
flexible and yielding membrane (54).
A seeder unit according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the selector
fingers (30) can be brought into abutment at their ends (34) remote from the disc (26) against a

stationary cam surface (22) under spring action.
A seeder unit according to claim 5, with a housing (12) consisting at least of a peripheral surface
(18) and a side surface, characterized in that the cam surface (22) is provided on the side surface

of the housing (12) and is of rising, ramp-like form in the material receiving zone and of falling,
ramp-like form in the material discharge zone (74).
A seeder unit according to one or more of the preceding claims, with a housing (12) consisting of
at least a peripheral surface (18) and a side surface, characterized in that the disc part (24) and

the disc (26) are arranged parallel to one another and fast against rotation on a drive shaft (28),
wherein the disc part (24) is spaced from the side surface of the housing (12) and bears against

an annular shoulder (20) in the peripheral surface (18), and wherein the disc (26) bears against 
the end of the peripheral surface (18) remote from the side surface of the housing (12).
A seeder unit according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that each
selector finger (30) is formed like a cup at its end (36) adjacent the disc (26).
A seeder unit according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that each
selector finger (30) is provided with an abutment surface (42) at its end (34) adjacent the side

surface of the housing (12), a spring (38) bearing at one end against the abutment surface and at
the other end against the disc part (24).
A seeder unit according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the selector
fingers (30) and the seed cells (52) are arranged on circles with the same diameter and in that a

seed cell (52) is associated with each selector finger (30).
