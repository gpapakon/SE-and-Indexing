<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a stone product in sheet form (1) suitable for use both outdoors and indoors, e.g. as a facade cladding or a fitting, etc. The stone product (1) in question has undergone impregnation treatment with a view to causing its strength and flexibility to be increased through the presence of an impregnating agent (3) in existing pores (4), cracks and other cavities in the stone sheet in question. A method for producing said stone product (1) and means for its manufacture are also included in the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
a stone product in sheet form comprising the steps of
providing a stone product in sheet form
which exhibits small
thickness in relation to overall surface of the
product, impregnating the
stone product with an impregnating agent substance
penetrating into pores, cracks, and other cavities of the stone product.
Such a method is known from DE-A-39 30 281.Due to their relatively low strength, previously
mentioned products of this kind are thick and, as a
result, heavy. Also, the stone material is not so
flexible as to be capable of withstanding bending
and similar effects without fracturing.EP-A-0 220 448 discloses a method for treating a
stone product comprising the step of impregnating
the stone product with an impregnating agent substance
penetrating into existing cavities whereby
the strength characteristics of the stone product
and the resistivity against weathering is increased.
In a combined under-pressure/high-pressure
treating method the stone product is impregnated
with the impregnating agent substance totally penetrating
into existing cavities without leaving a
bubble filled with gases in the middle of the stone
product.FR-A-2 416 875 discloses a method for increasing
the strength characteristics of porous stone products 
creating stone products with high resistance
against the influence of damaging atmospheric
agents. To this end an impregnating method using
subsequent high-pressure/low-pressure treatment of
the stone product is used.DE-A-19 38 077 discloses a method for impregnating
baked clay by immersing in an underpressure immersion
device the clay presenting an elevated temperature
with an impregnating agent substance.
After treatment the surface is smooth, resistive
against weathering and the shape of the clay may be
corrected after the step of baking.DE-A-39 30 281 discloses a method for producing
stone product in sheet form comprising the step of
impregnating the stone sheet with an impregnating
agent substance penetrating into existing cavities.
To this end, the sheet form is placed in a vacuum
chamber, the vacuum chamber is evacuated and the
sheet form is immersed in a resin of low viscosity.
Prior to these steps the sheet form is to be dehydrated
by heating with subsequent cooling down to
room temperature. After the step of immersing the
sheet form into the resin, the sheet form has to be
heated again in order to cure the resin. Using this
method, marble sheet forms are stabilized.US-A-4,177,789 refers to a method for

in relation to overall surface of the product

(1), impregnating the
stone product (1) with an impregnating agent

substance (3) penetrating into
pores, cracks, and other

cavities (4)
of the stone product (1),


characterized in that
 for improved strength
characteristics by means of increased

flexibility of the stone product (1) in
question the impregnation is performed at

pressure
preferably at high pressure,

that moisture, air and the like are
sucked off from the stone sheet in conjunction

with the pressure or high pressure
impregnation and in that

the agent substance (3) which is applied under
pressure fills and reinforces the natural

bonding between the stone crystals and bonds
any salts present in the stone.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the pressure during the pressure

impregnation is at least 0.8 MPa, and
preferably up to 15 MPa.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the agent substance (3)

comprises water-glass.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the agent substance (3)

comprises silicates.
