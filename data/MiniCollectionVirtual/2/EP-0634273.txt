<ABSTRACT>
A casing (25) and a nozzle plate (27) form a hollow 
cavity in which ink liquid can be filled. A buckling 

structure body (21) is disposed within this hollow cavity. 
A nozzle orifice (27a) is provided in a nozzle plate (27) 

at a position corresponding to the buckling structure body 
(21). 

The buckling structure body (21) has a portion 
extending in a longitudinal direction (in the direction of 

arrow D₂). Both ends of the buckling structure body (21) 
in the longitudinal direction are fixedly attached to the 

casing (25) via an insulative member (23). The buckling 
structure body (21) is formed of a material that is 

displaced at least in the longitudinal direction by 
conduction of current from a power source (29). Thus, an 

ink jet head of a long lifetime is provided that can 
provide a great discharge force while maintaining its 

small dimension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet head and
a method of manufacturing thereof, and more particularly
to an ink jet head for discharging ink droplets outwards
from the interior of a vessel by applying pressure to the
ink liquid in the vessel, and a method of manufacturing
thereof.An ink jet method of recording by discharging and
spraying out a recording liquid is known. This method
offers various advantages such as high speed printing with
low noise, reduction of the device in size, and
facilitation of color recording. Such an ink jet
recording method carries out recording using an ink jet
record head according to various droplet discharging
systems. For example, droplet discharge means includes an
ink jet head utilizing pressure by displacement of a
piezoelectric element, and a bubble type ink jet head.Layered type and bimorph type ink jet heads are known
as droplet discharging means utilizing a piezoelectric
element. A layered type ink jet head and a bimorph type
ink jet head will be described hereinafter with reference 
to the drawings as conventional first and second ink jet
heads.Fig. 52 schematically shows a sectional view of the
structure of a first conventional ink jet head. Referring
to Fig. 52, a first conventional ink jet head 310 utilizes
layered type piezoelectric elements as the droplet
discharging means. Ink jet head 310 includes a vessel 305
and a layered type piezoelectric element 304.Vessel 305 includes a cavity 305a, a nozzle orifice
305b, and an ink feed inlet 305c. Cavity 305a in vessel
305 can be filled with ink 80. Ink 80 can be supplied via
ink feed inlet 305c. Nozzle orifice 305b is provided at
the wall of vessel 305. Cavity 305a communicates with the
outside world of vessel 305 via nozzle orifice 305b. A
layered type piezoelectric element 304 is provided in
cavity 305a.Layered type piezoelectric element 304 includes a
plurality of piezoelectric elements 301 and a pair of
electrodes 303. The plurality of piezoelectric elements
301 are layered. The pair of electrodes 303 are arranged
alternately to be sandwiched between respective
piezoelectric elements 301, whereby voltage can be applied
effectively to each piezoelectric element 301. A power
source 307 is connected to the pair of electrodes 303 to
switch the application of voltage by turning ON/OFF a 
switch.According to an operation of ink jet head 301, the
switch is turned on, whereby voltage is applied to the
pair of electrodes 303. As a result, voltage is applied
to each of the plurality of piezoelectric elements,
