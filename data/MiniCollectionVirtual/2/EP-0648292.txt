<ABSTRACT>
An improved surface includes a synthetic turf base (104) positioned atop a foundation (102). The synthetic turf base (104) includes imitation grass blades (110) secured to a backing (112). The synthetic turf base (104) also includes a surface layer of material (118) supported by the backing (112) and intermixed with the imitation grass blades (110). Natural grass (120) is planted in the surface layer of material wherein the natural grass (120) includes natural grass blades (122) and roots (124). The backing (112) is provided with perforations or openings sufficient in number to permit the roots (124) of the natural grass to extend through the backing into the sub-base (108) of the foundation (102). The natural grass (128) improves the overall desirability of the surface by improving its durability, increasing its life span, reducing the cost of installation, reducing the cost of maintenance, improving comfort for users, and improving the benefits to the ecology.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial
No.07/902,147, filed June 22, 1992, by Jerry G. Bergevin, entitled IMPROVED
SURFACE FOR SPORTS AND OTHER USES, the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein, in its entirety, by the foregoing reference thereto.The present invention is directed toward an improved surface for
sports and other uses and, more particularly, toward a combination artificial and
natural surface and method of making the same.For years natural turf surfaces were used for most outdoor sports,
for example, soccer, football, field hockey, cricket rugby, etc. Natural turf
surfaces are surfaces constructed with a grass grown in soil or some other
surface layer of material (eg., sand and organic mixes, etc.), that is constructed
upon a suitable foundation. A natural turf surface is generally preferred for its
comfort, feel, grip, and appearance.However, under heavy use and/or poor weather conditions,
natural turf surfaces deteriorate rapidly and maintenance is costly. Intense
activity on the turf destroys the grass and its root system, leaving mud and/or
dirt as the playing surface. During this time, prior to re-establishment the
surface is often pockmarked, uneven, and possibly even hazardous to use.Due to the needs of the sports programs, play usually continues
until the sport's season is over, when the turf can be re-established. Further
these natural turf surfaces are not usable during the re-establishment period
because any use would defeat the re-establishment of the turf. The re-establishment
period typically takes at least four months, or longer, under ideal
weather conditions, during which the natural turf surface should not be used.More recently, synthetic turf surfaces have been used as an
alternative to natural turf surfaces. Synthetic turf surfaces generally come in 
two types i.e., conventional and sand filled. Conventional synthetic turf
is a dense synthetic material that takes the appearance of dense grass
blades and is manually placed indoors or outdoors, usually upon an
asphalt, concrete, wood, or other foundation. Sand-filled synthetic turf is
a synthetic material similar to conventional synthetic turf, but with greater
spacing between the blades, to accommodate a silica sand filling.Both the conventional and sand-filled synthetic turf are placed
indoors or outdoors, upon a foundation that may include an asphalt,
concrete, wood or other supporting subsurface, and cushioning mats,
water drainage and water irrigation.Although synthetic turf surfaces are

and
(c) natural grass plants (120) having grass blades (122),

substantially fill the synthetic grass turf (104) to the top of the imitation
gras
s blades (110) and in that each imitation grass blade extends upwards
in substantially the same direction, and the grass plants are disposed in

the growth medium (118), the roots (124) extending downwardly through
the growth medium (118), the synthetic grass turf (104), and into the

foundation (102), the crowns (123) being located slightly below the top of
the imitation grass blades (110) and the natural grass blades (122)

extending upwardly above the top of the imitation grass blades (110)
forming a playing surface of substantially natural grass.
The grass playing surface of Claim 1, characterised in that
the backing material (112) is formed at least partially of a biodegradable

material. 
The grass playing surface of claim 1, characterised in that
said imitation grass blades are constructed of at least first and second

lengths.
The grass surface of claim 3, characterised in that the layer
of growth medium (118) is disposed in the synthetic grass turf to a depth

sufficient to substantially fill the synthetic grass turf to the top of the
imitation grass blades having the first length with the imitation grass

blades having the second length extending upward above the top layer of
growth medium (118) and being formed of a predetermined color for

providing a visual indicator.
The grass playing surface of Claim 1, characterised in that
the imitation grass blades (110) extend upwardly from the backing

material (112) a sufficient distance to protect the roots (124) and crowns
