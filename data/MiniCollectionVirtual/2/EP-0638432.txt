<ABSTRACT>
A rotating print medium retaining clamp is disclosed 
which securely clamps the print medium or printed image 

final receiving surface to prevent horizontal or X-axis 
misregistration while drawing the print medium in a 

generally circular path through the nip between the 
platen and the print head. Only the retaining clamp 

assembly rotates while the support guide remains 
stationary. The support guide has space for a printing 

platen to be positioned along the print medium guide 
path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention related generally to printers and,
more specifically, to a printed media or paper handling
assembly for use with thermal color printers, such as
thermal wax transfer and sublimation dye color printers,
and the method of employing such assembly in a color
printer.Media handling mechanisms in the field of thermal
printing handle the print media, such as paper, by either
shuttling the print media back and forth during the
printing process or by rotating the medium in one
direction. When the goal is to efficiently move the
print media so that minimal time is required to print
multiple colors in color printing, the former approach is
less desirable. A more effective approach is the
rotation of the print media in one direction so that by
the time the bottom of the page is printed, the top of
the page is close to the print head for repetitive
printing.One approach which rotates the print medium in one
direction uses a clamp that directly attaches the paper
onto a circular rubber coated drum that also functions as
a platen. Printing occurs directly on the drum and the
paper or print medium motion is in a continuous circle.
This method has the advantage of actuating the print
medium clamp merely by reversing the direction of
rotation of the drum. However, a disadvantage of this
approach is that a wide and expensive print head is 
required because of the shallow tangent angle of the print head to the
large diameter drum or platen.Another approach utilizes two belts which rotate about three rollers, one
of which is the printing platen. This approach permits the use of a
relatively narrow print head with the attendant reduction in print head
cost. However, a distinct disadvantage of this design is the difficulty in
achieving good dot to dot registration from one printed pass to another
in color printing because of the skew and lateral or x-direction instability
of the twin belts.EPO 368643 discloses a print media handling apparatus and a method
of operation thereof, according to the preamble to the independent
claims herein.EPO 340925 discloses a paper clamping mechanism for clamping a
sheet of printing paper and a drum-shaped platen of a printer. The
mechanism includes a clamp member radially and slidably mounted at its
ends to the end surface of the platen. The platen is sized so as to
receive a full length of paper to be printed, the paper being moved
around the platen by the clamp which attaches to a leading edge of the
paper.According to the first aspect of the present invention, there is

<CLAIMS>
A print media handling apparatus for use in a printer comprising:-

(a) a print head (26) for printing on print media (3A);
(b) media support means (22, 24) connected to frame means
(11, 12, 13) to support the print media during printing;
(c) a platen (6) located adjacent to said print head (26) and
forming a nip (23) therebetween, for gripping said print media (3A)

during printing;
(d) clamping means (1) rotatably mounted to frame means (9,
10, 11) for retaining the print media and transporting the print media

along a path around the support means and through the nip (23);

characterised in that

the platen (16) and the clamping means are independently driven
(7, 8) to control tension to the print media in the nip during printing.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the clamping means is
driven by a motor.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the platen is
driven by a motor.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the platen is
driven by a torque limiter.
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
clamping means (1) is constructed and arranged to retain one element of

the media (3A) along a leading edge thereof, each such element having
a leading edged a trailing edge and two opposing sides connecting the

leading edge and the trailing edge. 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
clamping means (1) has a base plate (35) and clamp plate (31), the

clamp plate (31) being movably mounted to the base plate (35) to move
between an open position in which an element of the media (3A) is

insertable in and removable from the clamping means (1) and a closed
position in which said element is retained along a leading edge for

transport along the path past the print station (23).
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
platen (6) is rotatably mounted to the support means (22).
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
clamping means (1) is rotatable about a generally horizontal axis (11)

passing through the support means (22, 24).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 7 wherein the clamping means
(1) is exterior of the support means (22, 24) with respect to the

generally horizontal axis.
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
clamping means (1) is cooperative with stop means (2,2') to open the

clamp plate (31) when the clamping means (1) is rotated in a second
direction, opposite to a first direction followed by the print media (3A)

along the path to the nip (23).
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
support means (22) has a generally arcuate surface.
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
support means (22, 24) comprises a plurality of rollers (24). 
A method of transporting print media (3A) past a print head (26)
in a printer, comprising:-


(a) supporting the print media on support means (22, 24);
(b) gripping print media (3A) in a nip (23) formed between a
print head (26) and a platen (6);
(c) clamping (1) the print media and transporting the print
media in a path around the support means and through the nip (23);
(d) printing on print media (3A) in the nip (23);

characterised by

independently driving (7, 8) the platen and the clamping means to
control tension to the print media in the nip during printing.
