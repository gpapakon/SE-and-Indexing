<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a front loading laundry washing machine. As is known, domestic laundry washing machines can be of the top loading or front 
loading type, according to the arrangement of the opening for the loading and 
unloading of the clothes from the machine; The existence of two such categories of 
machines is due to various factors, from among which it is to be remembered the 
availability of space within the house, the aesthetic needs and, last but not least, the 
simple preference of the user for one type of laundry washing machine compared to 
the other. Generally laundry washing machines are made up of a parallelepiped cabinet 
containing a tub assembly; such tub assembly includes a container for the washing 
liquid, or a tub in a strict sense of the word, within which a basket for the laundry is 
mounted in a way so as to enable it to rotate around a substantially horizontal axis. In the case of front loading machines the basket, of a cylindrical form, has an opening 
in its frontal wall, substantially coaxial to two openings respectively present on the 
frontal wall of the tub and of the cabinet of the machine; the laundry is thus loaded and 
unloaded in relation to the basket through such openings that, during the functioning 
of the machine, are closed by a door, generally of a circular form. Inside the cabinet, appropriate means are provided for producing the rotation of the 
basket (electric motor, belts and pulleys), means for the supply and the discharge of 
the washing liquid from the tub (hydraulic conduits and one or more pumps) and a 
distributor device of washing agents, able to supply over determined times of the  
 
operating cycle of the laundry washing machine the detergent or eventual additives 
inside the tub; such a distributor, that usually has a draw-like form with a number of 
distinct compartments, is housed in the upper part of the cabinet of the machine. Said tub assembly has appropriate equalising or balancing masses, generally 
constituted by one or more counterweights in cement, or cast iron, or inert material, 
and by the motor itself of the laundry washing machine; such group, with organs 
associated to it, is centrally suspended inside the cabinet of the machine by means of 
suspension and/or support organs. The motor is usually fixed beneath of washing tub, while the cited counterweights and 
suspension/support elements are arranged in appropriate points, between the tub and 
the cabinet of the machine, i.e. in the frontal and/or upper, and/or
