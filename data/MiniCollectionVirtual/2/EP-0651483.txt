An enclosure for electrical switchgear comprising: 

a flat base (1; 101) equipped with at least two pillars (2, 102) arranged protruding out 
from the base and directed perpendicularly to the base towards the inside of the 

enclosure, 
an upright (20; 120) removably fixed on the base, said upright comprising at least 
two assembly elements (21, 22) designed to cooperate respectively with said two 

pillars and, 
at least one rail (40; 140) parallel to the base, arranged on the upright and designed 
to receive the electrical switchgear, 
a fast locking means (6, 7, 8, 27; 127) between each assembly element and the 
corresponding pillar, 
 
characterized in that said fast locking means (6, 7, 8, 27; 127) comprises a latch (27; 

127) which is mounted with sliding in said assembly element in a direction parallel to 
the base (1; 101) and which is designed to fit into corresponding housings (6, 7, 8) 

arranged along the corresponding pillar. 
The enclosure according to claim 1, characterized in that the assembly elements 
(21, 22; 121, 122) comprise at least one recess (24) designed to slide on the 

corresponding pillar (2; 102). 
The enclosure according to either one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that 
said fast locking means (6, 7, 8, 27; 127) enable locking of the assembly element to 

be established on the corresponding pillar (2; 102) in an adjustable position along the 
pillar, so that the distance between said assembly element and said base (1; 101) is 

adjustable. 
The enclosure according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that each 
said latch (27; 127) is arranged between the rail (40; 140) and the base and that it 

slides according to the longitudinal axis of the rail. 
The enclosure according to any one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the 
pillar (2; 102) and the recess (24) arranged in the corresponding assembly element 

have appreciably the shape of a half-cylinder. 
The enclosure according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that  
 

said base (1; 101) and said pillars (2; 102) form a monoblock assembly. 
The enclosure according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that 
said upright (20; 120) and said rail (40; 140) form a monoblock assembly. 
The enclosure according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that 
each of said pillars (2) comprises several sectile elements (2A, 2B, 2C) each 

presenting a housing (6, 7, 8) able to cooperate with a bistable latch (27). 
The enclosure according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that 
the rail (40) overshoots the assembly elements (21, 22) on both sides. 
The enclosure according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the 
longitudinal axis of the upright (120) is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rail (140).
