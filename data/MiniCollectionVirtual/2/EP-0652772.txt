<ABSTRACT>
A herpesvirus vaccine comprising a mutated herpesvirus suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The mutated herpesvirus is capable of infecting cells of the mammal to be vaccinated, but incapable of completing a replicative cycle, and it is capable of eliciting a protective immune response in that mammal. The mutation occurs in at least one gene encoding a protein essential for replication of the virus, so that the mutation renders the virus replication defective.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is herpesvirus
vaccines.Herpesviruses are enveloped double stranded DNA-containing
viruses in an icosahedral nucleocapsid. At
least seven herpesviruses are associated with disease in
humans, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1),
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster
virus (VZV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus
(CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus-7
(HHV-7). In general, a common property of
herpesviruses is their ability to establish a latent
infection in the host in which they multiply.HSV-1 is one of the most intensively studied
herpesviruses. HSV-1 exhibits a pattern of gene
expression during productive infection which is
stringently regulated (reviewed in Fields and Knipe,
Virology, 1990, Raven Press, NY). The 70 to 80 genes
encoded by this virus are classified in part according to
the kinetics of their expression. Expression of each
class of genes is dependent upon expression of genes from
the preceding class. The viral α or immediate early
genes are expressed first, followed by the viral β or
early genes which in turn are followed by the γ or late
genes. The γ genes are further subdivided into γ-1 and
γ-2 genes depending upon the extent to which their
expression relies upon viral DNA replication.Several viral proteins have been shown to regulate 
expression of HSV-1 genes. The ICP4 gene product is
essential for β and γ gene expression (DeLuca et al.,
1985, J. Virol. 56:558). The ICP27 gene product is
required for γ gene expression and for viral DNA
replication (McCarthy et al.,1989, J. Virol. 63:18). The
major DNA-binding protein (ICP8), a β gene product, is
also required for viral DNA replication and for γ gene
expression (Gao and Knipe, 1989, J. Virol. 63:5258;
Quinlan et al., 1984, Cell 36:657).Diseases caused by herpesviruses in humans vary
from mild to severe, and in some cases, infection with
these viruses is life-threatening.Vaccination is a common approach to prevention of
disease. Various vaccines based on isolated immunogens,
and on live, attenuated virus have been proposed for
herpesviruses: HSV -- Roizman, U.S. Patent 4,859,587;
and Meignier et al. (1988) J. Inf. Dis. 3: 603-613. VZV
-- Takahasi et al. (1975) Biken J. 18:25-33. CMV -- Elek
& Stern (1974) Lancet 1:1-5; and Plotkin et al. (1975)
