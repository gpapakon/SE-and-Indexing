<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveyor comprising a frame and 
drivable transport means, provided with carriers extending transversely 

to the direction of movement of the transport means, parallel to each 
other. The carriers are pivotally coupled to at least one flexible 

coupling 
means, whilst at least some of said carriers support pusher shoes. A 

pusher 
shoe is connected to a group of three guide wheels (6,7,8) positioned 

at the side 
of a respective carrier remote from the pusher shoe, which guide wheels 

are capable of cooperating with a guide rail (17) extending at an angle 
to the 

intended direction of movement of the carriers. At least one of the guide 
wheels of a group of guide wheels (6,7,8) is capable of cooperating 

with a guide 
rail at a lower level than another guide wheel, whereby at least part of 

a guide rail is designed to have a height such that at least one of the 
guide wheels of a group is positioned higher than the upper end of the 

part in question of the guide rail.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveyor comprising a frame and 
drivable transport means, provided with carriers extending transversely 
to the direction of movement of the transport means, parallel to each 
other, said carriers being pivotally coupled to at least one flexible 
coupling means, whilst at least some of said carriers support pusher shoes, 
whereby a pusher shoe is connected to a group of three guide wheels 
positioned at the side of a respective carrier remote from the pusher shoe, 
which guide wheels are capable of cooperating with a guide rail extending 
at an angle to the intended direction of movement of the carriers. A conveyor of this type is known from 
GB-A-2,057,381. This known conveyor comprises three guide 
wheels, which all have the same height. This known construction has several 
disadvantages. Thus the guide wheels can be guided along a guide rail on 
one side only. When for example a switch means is being passed all three 
guide wheels must furthermore have passed the switch before the position 
of the switch means can be changed. According to the invention at least one of the guide wheels 
of a group of guide wheels is capable of cooperating with a guide rail 
at a lower level than another guide wheel, and at least part of a guide 
rail is designed to have a height such that at least one of said guide 
wheels is positioned higher than the upper end of the part in question 
of the guide rail. By using the construction according to the invention a 
particularly efficient guiding of the guide wheels along the rails can 
be obtained, whilst at the same time it offers a far greater range of 
applications than the known construction. The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter 
with reference to a few embodiments of the construction according to the 
invention diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying Figures. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of rails forming part 
of a conveyor according to the invention and of guide wheels cooperating 
with said rails. Figure 2 is a diagrammatic side view of a pusher shoe with 
a group of three guide wheels connected thereto.  
 Figure 3 is a diagrammatic plan view of Figure 2, 
indicating the maximum pivoting angle of the support supporting the guide 
wheels. Figure 4 is a diagrammatic plan view of guide rails and 
guide wheels cooperating therewith of a further embodiment of a conveyor 
according to the invention. Figure 5 is a sectional view of Figure 4, along the line 
V-V in Figure 4. Figure 6 is a sectional view of

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor comprising a frame and drivable transport 
means, provided with carriers extending transversely to the direction of 

movement of the transport means, parallel to each other, said carriers (4) 
being pivotally coupled to at least one flexible coupling means, whilst 

at least some of said carriers support pusher shoes (3), whereby a pusher shoe 
is connected to a group of three guide wheels (7, 8, 9) positioned at the side of 

a respective carrier remote from the pusher shoe, which guide wheels are 
capable of cooperating with a guide rail (17-20) extending at an angle to the 

intended direction of movement of the carriers, characterized in that at 
least one of the guide wheels of a group of guide wheels is capable of 

cooperating with a guide rail at a lower level than another guide wheel, 
and at least part of a guide rail is designed to have a height such that 

at least one of said guide wheels is positioned higher than the upper end 
of the part in question of the guide rail. 
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said guide wheels are secured to a respective pusher shoe by means of a 

support carrying the guide wheels, which is pivotable with respect to said 
pusher shoe about a pivot axis coinciding with the axis of rotation of 

the middle guide wheel, whilst the two outer guide wheels reach under the 
middle guide wheel and a lowered rail portion is provided at the connecting 

bend between a guide rail extending in the longitudinal direction of the 
conveyor and a guide rail extending at an angle to the intended direction 

of movement. 
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that, seen in the direction of movement of the carriers, the front guide 

wheel of a group of guide wheels reaches further under the middle guide 
wheel than the rear guide wheel, whilst a switch tongue is arranged at 

the junction of a guide rail extending at an angle to the intended 
direction of movement and a guide rail extending in the longitudinal 

direction of the conveyor, which switch tongue is capable of engaging said 
front guide wheel and moving under said rear guide wheel. 
A conveyor according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that an intersection between guide rails extending at 

an angle to the intended direction of movement, in which intersection said 
guide rails are interrupted so as to allow passage of a connecting piece  

 
connecting a carrier to the transport means, is designed such that when 

a group of guide wheels passes said intersection, at least one of said 
guide wheels is confined between two guide rails extending parallel to 

each other, and at least one further guide wheel is in contact with a guide 
rail. 
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the axes of rotation of said three guide wheels take up a fixed position 

with respect to the associated pusher shoe, and lie in a plane extending 
at least substantially perpendicularly to the intended direction of 

movement, whereby the outer guide wheels are positioned higher than the 
upper sides of the guide rails with which the middle guide wheel 

cooperates, whilst a higher guide rail portion is arranged near an 
interruption in a guide rail extending at an angle to the intended 

direction of movement and cooperating with said middle guide wheel, 
downstream of said interruption and parallel to said guide rail, so as 

to cooperate with an outer guide wheel of the group of guide wheels in 
question.
