<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and method designed to carry out the following operations: holding the limb (1) to be deboned, cutting off the middle joint (3), including the tendons attached to it, cutting off the end joint (5) and/or the far end (6) of the limb, including the tendons attached to them, gripping the limb (1) between a first (10) and a second (11) compression plate, compressing the meat on the limb (1) between the two plates (10, 11) and squeezing part of at least one bone (7, 8, 9) out through the plate and, pushing out the at least one bone (7, 8, 9) by means of a push rod (12, 13, 14).

A device for boning limbs (1) of poultry or similarly 
built animals, in particular for boning wings and 

legs, having 

a retention device for clamping the limbs (1) 
when the centre joint (3) is bent with 

substantially parallel alignment of the bones 
(7, 8, 9), 
a first cutting device (2) for separating a 
centre joint (3) of the limbs (1), 
a second cutting device (4) for separating end 
joints (5) and/or end regions (6) of the limbs, 

and 
an ejection device for squeezing out the bones 
(7, 8, 9) in their longitudinal direction. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the retention device comprises 
a stripping die device for pressing through the 

centre joint (3) and for stripping off the meat 
and/or the skin situated in the region of the centre 

joint (3). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 2,
characterised in that
 the first (2) and/or second (4) 
cutting device comprises a saw. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the ejection device comprises 
a first (10) and a second (11) pressure plate 

substantially parallel to one another, which can be 
moved towards one another with the interposition o
f 
the limbs (1),
in that
 the first pressure plate (10) is provided 
with at least one recess (15, 16, 17) for pushing 

through the bones (7, 8, 9),
and in that
 the second pressure plate (11) has means 
(12, 13, 14) for ejecting the bones (7, 8, 9). 
A device according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the ejection means (12, 13, 14) 
comprise at least one recess, which with respect to 

its position is associated with the position of the 
bone (7, 8, 9), and also a ram (12, 13, 14) which can 

be passed through the recess. 
A device according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterised in that
 at least one of the pressure 
plates (10, 11) is constructed divided in the manner 

of clamp forceps and is provided with recesses (15, 
16, 17) for gripping around the bones (7, 8, 9). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the first (2) and the second 
(4) cutting devices are constructed so that the 

joints (3, 5) are separated with the separation of 
the tendons. 
A method for boning limbs, using the device according 
to one of Claims 1 to 7, with the following process 

steps: 

retention of the limbs (1) to be boned when the 
centre joint (3) is bent with substantially 

parallel alignment of the bones (7, 8, 9), 
separation of the centre joint (3) including the 
tendons attached thereto , 
separation of the end joint region (5) and/or 
of the end region of the limbs (1) including the 

tendons attached thereto,  
 
clamping of the limbs (1) between a first (10) 
and a second (11) pressure plate, 
pressing the meat of the limbs (1) between the 
pressure plates (10, 11) and partial pushing out 

of the at least one bone (7, 8, 9) by the 
pressure plate, and 
ejection of the at least one bone (7, 8, 9) in 
its longitudinal direction by means of a ram 

(12, 13, 14) (Fig. 17). 
A method according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 before separating the centre 
joint region (3) and/or the end joint (5) the meat 

located there with the associated skin is stripped 
off in the direction of the limbs (1). 
A method according to one of Claims 8 and 9,
characterised in that
 after the separation of the 
centre joint region (3) the limbs (1) are boned 

separately with respect to the two resultant 
individual parts.
