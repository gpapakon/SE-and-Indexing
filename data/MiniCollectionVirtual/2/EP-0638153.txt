<ABSTRACT>
A segmented seal ring and spring system for steam turbines for minimizing leakage between rotating (11) and stationary (12) components, and preventing damage and wear thereto, including a segmented seal ring (13), with first springs (16) biased against the seal segments (13) to urge the segments radially outward toward a large clearance position of the seal ring with respect to the turbine shaft. The springs (16) urge the seal segments (13) into the large clearance position at low shaft speeds and small turbine loads, whereas at medium to high flows and high working pressure, working fluid will overcome the spring forces and urge the seal segments into a small clearance position. Special gravity springs (36) are provided in the lower half seal ring segments (13) with the lower end of such springs seated against the turbine casing (12) while the upper spring end is biased against the seal segment (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to seals employed in
elastic fluid axial flow turbines and, more particularly, to a
segmented packing ring seal acting between a casing and a
rotatable shaft. Such seals may be located where a rotatable
shaft penetrates stationary turbine casing or internal to the
casing between stages and turbine sections.Generally, such known seals present or reduce leakage of
the fluid by creating small clearance areas with low flow
coefficients between the rotating and stationary parts.
Improved efficiency, minimised loss of fluid and prevention of
undesirable side effects caused by leakage of fluid are
objectives of such seals.Also, these segmented, labyrinth type seals are
vulnerable to rubbing damage caused by turbine misalignment,
vibration and thermal distortion. Most of these damage
causing factors are more likely to occur during starting, at
light loads or following sudden loss of load. As a result, it
would be desirable to create a condition of relatively large
clearance during these conditions, to minimise possible damage
to the seals, and yet still accomplish a small clearance
condition at higher loads. The higher load condition
corresponds to operation when efficiency is of greatest value
and where turbine operation is stable relative to most of the
factors which can cause damage to the seals.
It should be recognized that turbine designers already take 
significant steps to minimize fluid leakage. The seals are made
of materials specially selected to minimize damage caused by
rubbing. The seal geometry is designed with thin teeth to
require the least amount of heat and force during rubbing
situations. Retractable packing rings which, during start-up
conditions, have large radial clearance that automatically
decreases to a small clearance condition when a predetermined
flow condition has been reached, have also been successfully
applied in turbine applications where the pressure forces are
significantly greater than the weight forces of the packing
segments. In the low pressure stages, however, weight forces
are often too large to be successfully overcome by available
turbine pressure forces. As a result, in the lowest pressure
stages, it has not been practical to provide retractable packing
rings. This necessitates the use of seal rings that are spring
backed to force the packing segments to be in a close clearance
position at all times. One such spring backed seal ring
arrangement is shown in the United States Patent No. 4,017,088
issued on April 12, 1977 to G. Lergen

protect said seal ring from damage, comprising:

a stationary turbine casing (12) encircling a rotary
shaft (11) and having an annular T-shaped groove (15)

formed therein which extends circumferentially around said
shaft (11), said annular groove being partially defined by

a pair of opposing, spaced apart annular shoulders (12a,
12b) on said casing which form an annular opening of said

T-shaped groove (15);

contained within said groove (15), said seal ring (13)

said seal ring (13) being responsive to the forces
due to high flows and high working pressure of the working
