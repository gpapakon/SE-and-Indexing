<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyester compositions 
with a high viscosity. More specifically the present invention relates to 
polyester compositions with a high viscosity in the 
molten state, a high molecular weight and reduced 
content of carboxylic groups and the process for their 
preparation. Thermoplastic polyesters, in particular polyethyleneterephthalate, 
polybutyleneterephthalate, etc., are 
materials which have been used for a long time in the 
production of fibres, films, hollow containers, molded 
articles etc. with conventional transformation processes 
such as injection blowing, injection molding, 
extrusion, spinning, etc. It is known, however, that 
these products have several disadvantages when used, 
for example, in extrusion-blowing processes or foam 
production, owing to the insufficiently high viscosity 
in the molten state.  In the case of extrusion-blowing, the low viscosity 
in fact causes the material to drip in the transformation 
machine making the production of hollow containers 
difficult. In the preparation of foams the low viscosity of 
the molten polymer does not allow holding of the gas 
released by the foaming agent and causes the collapsing 
of the foam. One of the methods proposed to avoid these disadvantages 
consists in using polyfunctional compounds (so-called 
chain extenders) capable of reacting with the 
chain-ends of the polyester and thus developing partially 
cross-linked structures which cause an increase 
in the viscosity of the molten product. In literature 
there are patents and patent applications which describe 
the use of pyromellitic anhydride which is 
capable of reacting with the hydroxylic chain ends of 
polyester. Examples are: international patent application 
publication WO 90/10.667; European patent EP 
372.846; Japanese patent applications 59/210.955, 
74/85.142 and 04/45.132; European patent 442.759; 
German patents 2.837.846 and 3.244.371; English patent 
2.247.687, etc. During the chain extension reaction with pyromellitic 
anhydride reaction with the hydroxylic chain ends  
 
of the polymer leads to opening of the anhydride 
rings and the formation of free carboxylic 
groups directly bound to the benzenic ring. The carboxylic 
groups thus formed can produce a transesterification 
reaction with the chain of the polyester causing 
a partial branching/cross-linking of the polymer. In 
addition, carboxylic chain ends are already present 
in the polyester from the start and owing to thermomechanical 
degradation their number tends to
