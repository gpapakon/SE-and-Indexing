<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical compounds of the formula 

in which R¹ and R³ are each C₁₋₄ alkyl or C₁₋₄ alkyl-carbonyl, 
and R² is carboxy, tetrazolyl, C₁₋₄ alkyl-sulphonamido or 

-CR⁴R⁵CO₂H where R⁴ and R⁵ are each hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl; 
provided that when R¹ and R³ are both methyl and when R¹ and 

R³ are both methylcarbonyl, R² is not carboxy; and salts and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compounds and their 
preparation. There are many anthraquinone (9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracene) 
compounds disclosed in the literature and 
they are described as having a variety of uses. British 
Patent 1 578 452 discloses some compounds of this type which 
are related to the well-known compound rhein. The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compounds of 
the formula: 
in which R¹ and R³ are each C₁₋₄ alkyl or C₁₋₄ alkyl-carbonyl, 
and R² is carboxy, tetrazolyl, C₁₋₄ alkyl-sulphonamido or 
-CR⁴R⁵CO₂H where R⁴ and R⁵ are each hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl; 
provided that when R¹ and R³ are both methyl and when R¹ and 
R³ are both methylcarbonyl, R² is not carboxy; and salts and 
esters thereof. The compounds of the invention are indicated for use in the 
treatment of connective tissue matrix diseases such as 
osteoarthritis, and in the treatment of cancer.  A preferred group of compounds is one in which R¹ and R³ are 
each C₁₋₄ alkyl or C₁₋₄ alkyl-carbonyl, and R² is carboxy, 
tetrazolyl, C₁₋₄ alkyl-sulphonamido or -CR⁴R⁵CO₂H where R⁴ and 
R⁵ are each hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl; provided that when R¹ and 
R³ are both C₁₋₄ alkyl-carbonyl, R² is not carboxy; and salts 
and esters thereof. A C₁₋₄ alkyl group can be branched or unbranched, and includes 
methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and butyl, and is preferably 
methyl. The groups R⁴ and R⁵ are preferably each hydrogen or 
methyl. Preferred compounds are those in which R¹ and R³ take the same 
value. Specific examples of compounds according to the invention are 
as follows:
 
5-(9,10-dihydro-5,8-dimethoxy-9,10-dioxo-anthracen-2-yl)tetrazole,
 
5-(5,8-diacetoxy-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracen-2-yl)tetrazole,
 
N-(9,10-dihydro-5,8-dimethoxy-9,10-dioxoanthracen-2-yl)methanesulphonamide,
 
N-(5,8-diacetoxy-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracen-2-yl)methanesulphonamide,
 
 
9,10-dihydro-5,8-dimethoxy-9,10-dioxoanthracen-2-yl acetic 
acid,
 
5,8-diacetoxy-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracen-2-yl acetic 
acid;
 
or salts thereof. The compounds of the invention can exist in salt form derived 
from any of the well known bases. Preferably such salts are 
pharmaceutically-acceptable, but other salts are included as 
they may serve as intermediates in the purification of 
compounds or in the preparation of other salts, or are useful 
for identification, characterisation or purification. 
Examples are those derived from ammonium hydroxide and alkali 
and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates and 
bicarbonates, as well as salts
