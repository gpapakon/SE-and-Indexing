<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a novel continuous ion exchange apparatus capable of performing both ion 
exchange treatment and regeneration treatment within a single column by the use of ion 

exchange resin(s) whose ion exchange abilities can be regenerated by acid or alkali. The 
apparatus comprises a resin column or two including an adsorption zone, a washing zone, a 

regenerating zone sequentially sectioned from the bottom toward the top; a resin extraction 
transfer means for withdrawal the ion exchange resin from the bottom of the column and 

transferring them to a metering container disposed on the top of the column; a resin 
supply means for supplying the ion exchange resin within the metering container to the top of 

the column, a water passage system allowing the supply of feed water into the interior 
of the column from the bottom of the adsorption zone and allowing discharge of the treated 

water from the top of the adsorption zone to the exterior of the column; and a regenerant 
passage system allowing the supply of the regenerant from the bottom of the regeneration 

zone into the interior of the column and discharge of regenerant waste from the top of the 
regeneration zone to the exterior of the column.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally
to a two-bed type continuous ion exchange apparatus, e.g., for use in the
production of high purity water such as deionized water in which the feed water is upwardly
passed through an ion adsorption zone, a washing zone, a resin regeneration zone sequentially
segmented from the lower portion to the upper portion within a single column filled with an
ion exchange resin while the ion exchange resin is transferred downward or in the opposite
direction to the feed water passage direction in such a manner that the ion exchange resin
which has been regenerated and washed can be continuously supplied into the adsorption zone
from the upper portion, thereby executing a substantially continuous ion exchange treatment
of the feed water passing through the adsorption zone.A typical apparatus for the production of high purity water such as deionized water
hitherto known is a fixed-bed type ion exchange apparatus in which an ion exchange
treatment and a regeneration treatment by the passage of a regenerant are alternately performed.
However, the apparatus has a poor productivity due to the interruption of the
passage of feed water during the regeneration treatment, and hence is unsuitable for the
application requiring a successive supply of water. For this reason, various apparatuses
allowing a continuous ion exchange treatment without being interrupted have been put into
practical use.The continuous ion exchange apparatuses are classified into a fluidized bed type and a
moving bed type, the latter being industrially commonly used and subgrouped into a mixed
bed type and a multiple-bed type. The mixed bed type continuous ion exchange apparatus comprises an exhaustion
(adsorption) column mixedly filled with cation exchange resin and anion exchange resin, a
resin separation column, and a couple of regeneration columns. In this apparatus, feed water
is introduced into the exhaustion column through the lower portion thereof, to force the mixed
resin bed toward the top of the exhaustion column to form a fixed bed, subjecting the feed
water passing therethrough to an ion exchange treatment. This will allow a gradual upward
movement of the ion exchange zone in which ion exchange takes place within the mixed resin
bed through which the feed water passes. The resins exhausted with impurity ions (the resins
whose ion exchange ability to adsorb impurity ions have been spent) are transferred as a
slurry through the bottom of the exhaustion column to the resin separation column in which
the
