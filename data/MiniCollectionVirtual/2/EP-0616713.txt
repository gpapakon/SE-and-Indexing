<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for creating and maintaining multiple document versions in a data processing system implemented library. Selected documents within a data processing system implemented library are uniquely identified as root documents and a version-root identifier for each successor version of a particular root document is established. Thereafter, a selected version-root identifier is automatically associated with each created successor version of a root document. Upon the creation of a successor version of a root document and a second predecessor document, the version-root identifier associated with the root document is automatically associated with the successor version and the second predecessor document. Upon the creation of a successor version base upon multiple non-root predecessor documents a particular non-root predecessor document is automatically selected as a root document and a version-root identifier is established and associated therewith. Thereafter, the newly established version-root identifier is automatically associated with all non-root predecessor documents and the successor version based thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to data 
processing system implemented libraries and in 
particular to a method and system for creating and 
maintaining multiple document versions within a data 
processing system implemented library. Still more 
particularly the present invention relates a method and 
system for creating and maintaining multiple 
predecessor and successor versions of a document within 
a data processing system implemented library. Electronically implemented "libraries" are rapidly 
surpassing more traditional forms of information 
storage in the world today. It is quite common for data 
processing system implemented libraries to maintain and 
control thousand of different objects, or documents. 
The rules by which such documents may be altered and/or 
maintained are typically governed by various standards 
such as the International Standard ISO/IEC 10166, 
Document Filing and Retrieval (DFR). One problem which exists in such electronic libraries is 
the management and control of multiple versions of a 
selected document in a so-called "Conceptual Document"  
 
wherein all documents therein are related. Many systems 
exist for governing relationships between multiple 
versions of a single document in a linear relationship. 
That is, a relationship wherein a selected document may 
have a single predecessor document and a single successor 
document (see e.g. EP-A-0230616). While the need for a method and system which 
permits each document to have multiple predecessors and 
successor documents has been generally alluded to, no 
current library system permits such a relationship to 
be created and maintained. It should therefore be apparent that a need exist for a 
method and system which permits multiple predecessor 
and successor versions of a document to be created and 
maintained within a data processing system library. It is therefore one object of the present invention to 
provide an improved data processing system implemented 
library. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide an improved method and system for creating and 
maintaining multiple document versions within a data 
processing system implemented library. It is yet another object of the present invention to 
provide an improved method and system for creating and 
maintaining multiple predecessor and successor versions 
of a document within a data processing system 
implemented library. The foregoing objects are achieved by the subject-matter of Claims 1 and 5.

<CLAIMS>
A method in a data processing system implemented 
library for creating and maintaining multiple 

versions of a document within said library, said 
method comprising the data processing system 

implemented steps of:
 
uniquely identifying an original document within 

said library as a root document;
 
establishing a version-root identifier for all 

successor versions of said original document which 
may thereafter be created within said library;
 
automatically associating said version-root 

identifier with each successor version of said 
original document within said library;
 
characterized by the data processing system 

implemented steps of:
 
for each successor version of said original 

document and a second predecessor document, 
automatically associating (76, 86, 92) said 

version-root identifier with said successor 
version and said second predecessor document 

wherein all related documents within said library 
will have an identical version-root identifier 

associated therewith. 
The method in a data processing system implemented 
library for creating and maintaining multiple 

versions of a document within said library 
according to Claim 1, further including the step 

of, for each successor version of a first  
 

predecessor document and a second predecessor 
document, automatically identifying (96) a 

selected one of said predecessor documents as a 
root document and establishing a particular 

version-root identifier for all successor versions 
thereof; and
 
thereafter, automatically associating (96) said 

particular version-root identifier with said 
successor version of said first predecessor 

document and said second predecessor document. 
The method in a data processing system implemented 
library for creating and maintaining multiple 

versions of a document within said library according 
to Claim 1 or 2, further including the step of 

associating an identification of an immediate 
predecessor document with each successor document 

within said library. 
The method in a data processing system implemented 
library for creating and maintaining multiple 

versions of a document within said library 
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, further 

including the step of associating a unique 
version-name with each successor version of said 

original document. 
A data processing system for creating and 
maintaining multiple versions of a document within 

a library within said data processing system, said 
data processing system comprising:
 
means for uniquely identifying an original 

document within said library as a root document;
  
 

means for establishing a version-root identifier 
for all successor versions of said original 

document which may thereafter be created within said 
library;
 
means for automatically associating said 

version-root identifier with each successor 
version of said original document within said 

library;
 
characterized in that said data processing system 

further comprises;
 
means for automatically associating (76, 86, 92) 

said version-root identifier with a successor 
version of said original document and a second 

predecessor document, 
wherein all related documents within 

said library will have an identical version-root 
identifier associated therewith. 
The data processing system for creating and 
maintaining multiple versions of a document within 

a library within said data processing system 
according to Claim 5, further including means for, 

for each successor version of a first predecessor 
document and a second predecessor document, 

automatically identifying (96) a selected one of 
said predecessor documents as a root document and 

establishing a particular version-root identifier 
for all successor versions thereof; and
 
thereafter, automatically associating (96) said 

particular version-root identifier with said 
successor version of said first predecessor 

document and said second predecessor document.  
 
The data processing system for creating and 
maintaining multiple versions of a document within 

a library within said data processing system 
according to Claim 5 or 6, further including means 

for associating an identification of an immediate 
predecessor document with each successor version 

document within said library. 
The data processing system for creating and 
maintaining multiple versions of a document within 

a library within said data processing system 
according to one of Claims 5 to 7, further 

including means for associating a unique 
version-name with each successor version of said 

original document.
