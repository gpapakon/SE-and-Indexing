<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a composition comprising ribonuclease treated RNA or DNA dependent RNA polymerase, and the use of same in amplification methods. The treatment of the RNA or DNA dependent RNA polymerase with ribonuclease reduces or eliminates false positives which result from the presence of an endogenous or contaminating replicatable template species in the Q(beta) replicase enzyme preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various DNA amplification systems are known. In the case of DNA, PCR
systems and PCR-based systems (e.g. "multiplex" PCR as discussed in WO89/11548)
can be used. The present invention however relates to RNA amplification systems.Q Beta (Qβ) replicase is a template specific RNA
directed RNA polymerase derived from the bacteriophage Qβ.
Invivo, the normal function of Qβ replicase is to
replicate the RNA genome of the Qβ bacteriophage to produce
progeny phage genomes. The Qβ virion contains one molecule
of single stranded RNA which is termed the viral plus
strand. This is a strand utilized as mRNA to direct viral
protein synthesis. The Qβ replicase enzyme uses this plus
strand as the template to produce RNA copies which are
complementary to the original template. These RNA
molecules are termed minus strands.Importantly, both the plus and minus strands are
templates for the enzyme. Therefore, the replication of
the RNA template proceeds in an exponential fashion. Thus,
a few molecules of the replicatable RNA template are
replicated in an exponential fashion so long as the enzyme
is present in molar excess.The enzyme also has the capacity to replicate certain
RNA and DNA templates invitro. One well studied example
of such an RNA template is the MDV-1 RNA (Mills et al.,
Science180: 916-927 (1973)). The amplification of MDV-1
DNA by the enzyme Qβ replicase has been disclosed, for
example in published European Patent Application 91309430.6
(publication number 0 481 704 A1). Under conditions
appropriate for replication, each round of replication
takes approximately 15 seconds. Under these conditions, a
single MDV-1 molecule will yield 1012 progeny strands in
only thirteen minutes (Pritchard and Stefano, Ann. Biol.
Clin.48: 492-497 (1990)). This is an amount of RNA which
is easily detectable by conventional methods such as
fluorescence. Additional nucleic acid sequences may be joined to the
Qβ replicase template sequences to generate a recombinant
template which is useful as a hybridization probe for the
detection of a target nucleic acid sequence in a sample.
In general, the additional nucleic acid sequence can be
embedded at tolerant positions within the replicatable RNA
or DNA sequence (see e.g., Miele et al., J. Mol. Biol.171:
281-295 (1983)), or it can be added to either the 5' or 3'
end of the replicatable template molecule (see e.g., U.S.
Patent No. 5,112,734). Either of these embodiments are
useful in conventional hybridization methods.Typically, such hybridization methods require that
nucleic acids from
