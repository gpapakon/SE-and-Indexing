<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering crystals from a 
crystal-containing slurry, which comprises supplying 

the slurry to a rotary filter having a rotating 

cylindrical filter medium, filtering the supplied 
slurry in a filtering region to retain the crystals on 

the filter medium and washing the filter cake formed on 
the rotating filter medium repeatedly in a plurality of 

washing regions by spraying a washing liquid onto the 
cake in each region by supplying any one of washing 

regions on the aft side in the rotating direction of 
the filter medium with the spent washing liquid of the 

washing region neighboring said one washing region on 
the fore side in the rotating direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for recovering terephthalic acid crystals from a slurry containing
such crystals.Terephthalic acid used as a starting material of polyethelene
terephthalate and the like is produced by oxidizing
paraxylene with a molecular oxygen-containing
gas in a reaction medium based on acetic acid, wherein
the resulting terephthalic acid will deposit in the reaction
liqour in a crystalline form. Since the so-formed slurry of
the crystalline terephthalic acid contains also the acetic
acid solvent, the unreacted paraxylene, by-products
and the catalyst components, it is necessary to separate
the terephthalic acid crystals, from the slurry in
order then to recover the terephthalic acid.Fig. 3 shows a schematic sequence diagram for a
conventional method for recovering terephthalic acid
crystals from such a slurry. In Fig. 3, the numeral 101
denotes an oxidizing reactor, to which a raw material
mixture 102 composed of paraxylene as the starting
material, acetic acid as the reaction medium and the
catalyst is supplied, while supplying thereto at the same
time a molecular oxygen-containing gas 103 to cause
oxidation of the paraxylene into terephthalic acid.In this conventional technique for recovering
terephthalic acid crystals, the crystal-containing slurry
104 formed in the oxidizing reactor 101 is transferred to
a first stage solid/liquid separator 105 to effect a primary
solid/liquid separation to separate the crystals from the
liquid phase. The liquid phase 106 composed mainly of
acetic acid separated here is returned to the oxidizing
reactor 101, while the crude crystals 107 are forwarded
to a re-disperser 108, where the crystals are suspended
again in a medium of acetic acid 109 fed thereto in order
to dissolve out the contaminants included in the crude
crystal mass. The resulting reformed slurry 110 is then
subjected to a secondary liquid/solid separation to separate
the crystals from the liquid phase in a second
stage solid/liquid separator 111. The separated liquid
phase 112 composed mainly of acetic acid is transferred
to the oxidizing reactor 101, while the purified
crystals 113 are forwarded to a drier 114. The dried
crystals 115 are stored in a silo 116. The recovered
crystals 117 are then conveyed to a disperser 118,
whereto water 119 is also supplied and is mixed with the
crystals 117 to form an aqueous slurry 120 which is
guided then to a refinery system to refine the crystals.The conventional technique for recovering crystals
from a slurry thus requires a large

A method of recovering terephthalic acid crystals from a crystal-containing
slurry using a rotary filter (4) having a rotating cylindrical filter

medium (9), the method comprising:

supplying the crystal-containing slurry from a slurry preparation step to
the outside of the rotating cylindrical filter medium (9) whilst pressurizing with inert gas the

slurry side of the rotary filter (4), the rotary filter (4) having a plurality of
washing regions (9b, 9c, 9d) including at least a first washing region (9b) and a

last washing region (9d), the last washing region (9d) being downstream of the
first washing region (9b) in the direction of rotation of the filter medium (9);
filtering the supplied slurry in a filtering region (9a) of the rotary filter (4)
so as to form a filtrate and to separate the crystals as a filter cake on the filter

medium (9);
washing the filter cake on the rotating filter medium (9) in the plurality of
washing regions (9b, 9c, 9d) by supplying washing liquid to the washing regions

and collecting the spent washing liquid from each of the washing regions,the
washing liquid supplied to said last washing region (9d) being fresh washing

liquid and the washing liquid supplied to the first washing region (9b) being spent
washing liquid collected from the washing region (9c) immediately downstream

of the first washing region (9b) in the direction of rotation of the filter medium
(9);
supplying to the slurry preparation step the spent washing liquid collected
from the first washing region (9b), together with the filtrate from the filtering

region (9a); and
collecting the washed filter cake from the filter medium (9).
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the rotary filter (4) has
three washing regions (9b, 9c, 9d) comprising said first (9b) and last (9d) washing

regions and an intermediate washing region (9c) provided therebetween, the
washing liquid supplied to the intermediate washing region (9c) being spent

washing liquid collected from said last washing region (9d) and the washing
liquid supplied to said first washing region (9b) being spent washing liquid

collected from the intermediate washing region (9c).
