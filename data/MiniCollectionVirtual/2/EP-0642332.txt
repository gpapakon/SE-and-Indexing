<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ophthalmic compositions, particularly eye-drop formulations, 
comprising a cyclosporin as active ingredient and being suitable for the treatment of diseases 
of the eye and surrounding areas. The cyclosporins comprise a large and recognized class of peptide compounds having 
pharmaceutical utility, for example immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory, and/or 
anti-parasitic activity and/or activity in abrogating tumor resistance to anti-neoplastic or 
cytostatic drug therapy. The cyclosporins include, for example, naturally occurring fungal 
metabolites, such as the cyclosporin A, B, C, D and G, as well as a wide variety of synthetic 
and semi-synthetic cyclosporins, for example the dihydro- and iso-cyclosporins (see e.g. US 
Patents 4,108,985; 4,210,581 and 4,220,641), [(D)-Ser]8-Ciclosporin (see US Patent 
4,384,996), [0-acetyl, (D)-Ser]8-Ciclosporin (see US Patent 4,764,503), 
[Î²-fluoro-(D)Ala]8-Ciclosporin (see UK Patent Application 2,206,119A), 
[Val]2-[(D)methylthio-Sar]3- and [Dihydro-MeBmt]1-[Val]2-[(D)methylthio-Sar]3-Ciclosporin 
[see US Patent 4,703,033], [0-(2-hydroxyethyl)-(D)Ser]8-Ciclosporin, and [3'-deshydroxy-3'--keto-MeBmt]1-[Val]2-Ciclosporin 
and many more. Of the cyclosporins, the most widely investigated to date is cyclosporin A, being 
commercially available under the Registered Trade Mark SANDIMMUN or SANDIMMUNE. 
Cyclosporin A has been shown to suppress selectively a variety of T-lymphocyte functions, 
including prevention of maturation and expression of sensitized T-lymphocytes in cell 
mediated immune responses, and is now successfully and widely used in the suppression of 
organ transplant rejection. Published UK patent application 2 211 848 discloses pharmaceutical compositions 
comprising cyclosporin as active ingredient in orthorhombic crystal form. The cyclosporin 
is present in particulate form suspended or dispersed in a pharmaceutical diluent or carrier in 
which the chosen crystal form may be retained. Cyclosporin A has also been used systemically in the treatment of intraocular 
inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, such as uveitis. However, because of the side effects 
associated with systemic therapy, Cyclosporin A has had only limited use in treating 
conditions of the eye.  
 Effective topical administration of Cyclosporin A to the eye would reduce or eliminate 
to a large extent the systemic side effects by restricting activity to the locus of the condition 
being treated and proposals to this effect have been made, (see for example US
