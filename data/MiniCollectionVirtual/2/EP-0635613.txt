<ABSTRACT>
The timing belt (4) connected with the roller of the 
sliding door is moved correspondingly with operation of the 

sliding door. Thus, the driven pulley (6) fixed to the 
wall surface is also rotated. When the driven pulley (6) 

is rotated toward direction 96 by opening the sliding 
door, the stopper arm (9) springs up. 

When the operator releases the force immediately, 
the arm head (9H) is pulled down until it exceeds the 

standard line (L1), due to the driven pulley (6) being 
rotated reversely to direction 97 according to automatic 

closing force of the door closer. On the other hand, 
when the operator hold the sliding door for predetermined 

duration and then release the force, the arm head (9H) is 
positioned on the standard line (L1), and the sliding 

door stops at the position by a pressure of the timing 
belt (4) of the driven pulley (6) caused by pressurize 

force of the pressure spring (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sliding door
stopper device, more specifically, a structure of the
device for sliding door which opens and closes along with
a door rail attached to a wall surface.Fig. 1A shows a schematic view of a sliding door,
Fig. 1B, Fig. 2A, Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C respectively show
conventional sliding door stopper devices. As shown in
Fig. 1A, two roller(s) 100 are attached to the sliding
door 10, the roller(s) 100 being mounted on a door rail 120
attached on a wall surface 30. When the sliding door 10
opens or closes by an operator, the rollers 100 rotate on
the door rail 120 to move the sliding door 10 to
direction 90 or direction 91 smoothly.Once the sliding door 10 opens toward the
direction 90, the sliding door 10 is supposed to be
closed to the direction 91 automatically. A structure
for automatic door closer is realized by following
mechanism. For instance, attachment of the door rail 120
inclines to the closing direction, so that, the sliding
door 10 is closed automatically by own weight. Another
structure for automatic door closer is realized by 
utilizing a closer (not shown) using a spring or the like
to cause a reset force toward direction 91 to close the
sliding door 10 automatically. Under these structure, it
is not necessary to close the sliding door 10 manually
when operating the door, so that, it helps for operating
the sliding door.Related with opening the sliding door 10, there
is a case that the sliding door 10 needs to be stopped in
predetermined position during an opening motion. Fig. 1B
shows an example in the conventional structure to stop
the sliding door during the opening motion (Japanese
Patent Publication No. H4-176983). Fig. 1B is a cross
sectional view illustrating the roller attached to the
sliding door 10.A roller shaft 101J is fixed to a door
attachment 103 (Fig. 1A), the roller 101 is rotated by
centering around the roller shaft 101J. Pressurize pins
105 and 106 are respectively installed in the roller 101
at three places, these pins are pressed inwardly by
an elastic belt 107. Also, a needle bearing 104 is
positioned between the pressurize pin 105, 106 and the
roller shaft 101J. When the needle bearing 104 is
substantially positioned between center of the pressurize
pin 105 and the pressurize pin 106, the roller shaft 101J
receives inward pressure therefrom.For instance, when the sliding door 10 opens 
toward the direction 90, the roller 101 moves to the
direction 92 on the door rail 120 with maintaining its'
rotation. By rotating the roller 101

<CLAIMS>
A sliding door stopper device (8) installed to a
sliding door (10), said door movable from an open position

in a closing direction automatically, the device having a
rotating part (6) allowing a rotating movement

corresponding to the closing and the opening of the door
along a rail (5) attached to a wall surface (30), the

device comprising:

a) a stopping arm (9) pivoting on a standard line (L1)
which passes through the center of the rotating part (6)

and lying in a plane which is parallel to the rail (5), a
first end of the stopping arm being movable reciprocally

across the standard line (L1) and a second movable end
being movable reciprocally across the standard line (L1),

the second end facing to the external surface of the
rotating part (6);
b) a biasing part (12) which biases the first movable end
of the arm in alignment with the standard line;
c) a pressing part (13) maintaining a stop position of
the rotating part (6) by a pressing force, by which the

stopping arm (9) is pressed toward the external surface of
the rotating part (6) when rotation of the rotating part

(6) stops for a predetermined duration and in a condition
that the first movable end of the stopping arm is located

on the standard line (L1).
