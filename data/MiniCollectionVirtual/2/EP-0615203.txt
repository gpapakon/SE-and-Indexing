<ABSTRACT>
On the basis of the fact that the number of physical 
/geometrical parameters is smaller than that of the device 

parameters of an equivalent circuit model, the device 
parameters of the equivalent circuit are optimized on the 

basis of the device parameters obtained by converting the 
physical /geometrical parameters. When the obtained device 

parameters are not converged, the physical/geometrical 
parameters are updated so as to be converged to a convergent 

point quickly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for fitting circuit parameters of an equivalent circuit 
model, and more specifically a method and apparatus for 
optimizing circuit parameters of an equivalent circuit 
model of a device under design in order to analyze the 
device operation. In the simulation for analyzing the operation of a 
transistor circuit, it has been a general method in which 
a simulated circuit is designed using equivalent circuit 
models of elements (e.g., BJT (bipolar junction transistors), 
FETs, etc.) which constitute a circuit to be 
simulated, and then the operation of the simulation circuit 
is examined. In this simulation, parameter fitting is 
required to adjust and optimize the characteristics of the 
simulation circuit elements so as to be equivalent to those 
of the actual circuit elements. As the conventional parameter fitting method, there has 
been so far adopted such a cut-and-try method in which 
calculation formulae are solved; an actual integrated 
circuit is manufactured; and the actual operation of the 
manufactured; the manufactured circuit is tested; these 
procedures are repeated. However, this method is extremely 
difficult when the circuit scale is as large as an LSI 
circuit. In addition, in the conventional method, it has 
been actually impossible to simulate operation of the LSI 
circuit with the use of a computer. To overcome this method, a method of operating a 
simulation circuit on a computer has been developed. In 
this case, the typical equivalent circuit model now being 
used is Gummel-Poon model. This Gummel-Poon model is an 
equivalent circuit model composed of BJTs, and includes 44  
 
device parameters representative of various devices (e.g., 
resistances, capacitances, etc.) for constituting the 
equivalent circuit. This method of fitting circuit parameters is usually 
executed by software referred to as an optimizer. In the 
execution of the circuit parameter fitting by the 
optimizer, the VCE - Ic characteristic, for instance of the 
simulation circuit is measured actually; the measured 
characteristic values are compared with the characteristic 
value calculated on the basis of the set device parameters; 
the set device parameters are adjusted in such a way that 
the deviation value between two characteristic values can 
be reduced; and the above-mentioned processing is repeated 
until each of the deviation values of the various characteristics 
determined on the basis of the various parameters 
can be converged within an
