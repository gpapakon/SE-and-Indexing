<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the operation of a pressure-medium-actuated positioner or gripping or clamping device, as well as to a tool itself, in which the position of at least one actuator is determined and the valve-actuated pressure-medium feed to the actuator is controlled as a function of position. In order to be able to make allowance for the elasticity of the system elements in the target position and have an effect after reaching the target position in a process as well as in a tool of the type as defined in the preamble, it is proposed according to the invention that, in addition to the pressure-medium feed controlled as a function of position, the pressure of the pressure medium also have an influence on the control of the valve-actuated pressure-medium feed.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the operation of a pressure medium-operated
positioning or gripping and clamping tool, in which the

position of at least one actuator is detected and the valve-actuated
pressure medium supply to the actuator is regulated

in a position-dependent manner, characterised in that the
pressure of the pressure medium is included in the

regulation of the valve-actuated pressure medium supply in
addition to the pressure medium supply which is regulated in

a position-dependent manner and, after the actuating travel
designated for the positioning task has been determined for

the first time, this travel is divided into different zones.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
actuating travel is divided into at least two zones, the

first zone extending as the positioning phase from a start
position S
pos
 to a selectable tolerance limit T
pos
 near a
target position Z
pos
, and the second zone extending as the
search phase from the tolerance limit T
pos
 to the target
zone Z
pos
.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that the
pressure medium supply to the actuator is regulated largely

in a position-dependent manner in the first zone and in a
position- and/or speed-dependent manner in the second zone.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that the
second zone is followed by a pressing zone, in which

regulation is solely pressure-dependent.
Process according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that
the storage of the parameters for the zone division and for

the position and pressure values is effected on an adaptive
basis for repetitive positioning tasks.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that,
after the target position has been reached and the pressing

phase passed through, there follows a holding phase in which 
the pressure medium supply is regulated in a time-and/or

event-dependent manner.
Pressure medium-operated positioning or gripping and
clamping tool, in particular for mechanical electrode

actuation in welding robots, with at least one valve-controlled,
pressure medium-operated actuator, and with

means for detecting the position of the actuator(s),
characterised in that means (D1, D2) are provided for

detecting the pressure of the pressure medium in the region
of the pressure medium supply
 to the actuator (1, Z1, Z2),
and these means consist of at least one pressure sensor per

valve (V1, V2), which is/are disposed in the part (Al, A2)
of the valve(s) (V1, V2) on the working side, the pressure

sensors and the position detection system (M1) being
connected to a digital controller (DR) to transmit the

measured values.
Pressure medium-operated positioning or gripping and
clamping tool according to claim 7, characterised in that

the digital controller (DR) is connected to a programmable
logic control unit (SPS).
Pressure medium-operated positioning or gripping and
clamping tool according to claim 8, characterised in that

the valves (V1, V2) can be controlled via the digital
controller (DR).
