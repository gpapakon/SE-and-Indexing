<ABSTRACT>
A telecommunication terminal apparatus is proposed which is suitable for use in areas at risk from explosion. The telecommunication terminal apparatus (13) comprises a vibration generator (1) for tactile alerting which is enclosed in gas-proof fashion in a housing (14). Penetration of gas into the vibration generator (1), where sparks may occur, is thus not possible.

<CLAIMS>
Telecommunication terminal device with a vibration
motor for tactile alerting, 
characterized in that

the vibration motor (1) has electrical connections
(3) and a housing (14), which fully or partially

encloses the vibration motor (1) in a gastight
manner, 
in that
 the housing (14) is closed on the
connection side by a casting compound (6) which

encloses the electrical connections (3).
Telecommunication terminal device according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the housing (14) is
a sleeve (4) which is open on one side, its open

end being closed by the casting compound (6) after
the vibration motor (1) has been introduced.
Telecommunication terminal device according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the housing (14) has
a cap (7) which is open on one side and a piece of

tube (8) which is open on both sides, the piece of
tube (8) which is open on both sides being closed

on one side by the casting compound (6) in the
state in which it is mounted on one end of the

vibration motor (1), and the cap (7) which is open
on one side having been pushed onto the other end

of the vibration motor (1). 
Telecommunication terminal device according to
Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the seating of the
cap (7) and of the piece of tube (8) which is open

on both sides is sealed in a gastight manner by a
sealing compound (9).
Telecommunication terminal device according to one
of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the housing
(14) has indentations (5), by which the position of

the vibration motor (1) with respect to the housing
(14) is fixed.
Telecommunication terminal device according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the housing has a
tube (10) which is open on both sides and a cover

(11), the tube (10) which is open on both sides
being formed in one piece with the vibration motor

(1) and protruding beyond the vibration motor (1)
in its outer dimensions, and 
in that
 one end of the
tube (10) which is open on both sides is sealed by

the cover (11) and the other end is closed by the
casting compound (6).
Telecommunication terminal device according to one
of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 further
parts of the telecommunication device (13) are

embedded in the casting compound (6).
Telecommunication terminal device according to one
of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the casting
compound (6) is a polyurethane-based casting resin.
Telecommunication terminal device according to
Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the housing
(14) is made of metal.
