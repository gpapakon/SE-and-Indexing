<ABSTRACT>
The active carrier particles of even size of the polymerization catalyst are prepared so that a melt of a complex composition is provided having the formula (I): MgCl2 nROH mED, in which ROH depicts an aliphatic alcohol, R is a C1-C6 alkyl, ED depicts an electron donor, n is 1 to 6 and m is 0 to 1; the melt provided is fed to a nozzle (4); the melt is sprayed from the nozzle (4) to the spraying area (5), in which it is divided into fine melt droplets and possibly partly solidifies; the possibly partly solidified melt particles are transferred to a cooled crystallization area (6), where they crystallize to solid carrier particles; and the solid carrier particles are recovered. The melt mentioned is sprayed through a nozzle (4), which is rotated or which has attached to it a member that rotates and throws melt outwards from the rotating center to the spraying area (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the preparation of
solid carrier particles for a polymerization catalyst, in
which there is provided a melt of a complex composition
having the formula (I)
MgCl2 nROH mED
in which ROH depicts an aliphatic alcohol, R is a C1-C6
alkyl, ED depicts an electron donor, n is 1 to 6 and m is 0
to 1; the melt provided is fed to a nozzle; the melt is
sprayed from the nozzle to a spraying area in which it is
divided into fine melt droplets and solidifies to solid
carrier particles; and the solid carrier particles are
recovered. The invention also relates to a method in which
the olefin polymerization catalyst is provided by bringing
the recovered solid carrier particles together with a
transition metal compound being catalytically capable of
activation, such as titanium tetrachloride, and the use of
the olefin polymerization catalyst thus prepared together
with a cocatalyst and alternately an external electron donor
for the polymerization of olefins.Polymerization catalysts and particularly catalysts of
Ziegler-Natta type nowadays typically comprise an inert
solid carrier, on which the actual active catalyst component
or the mixture or complex formed by the catalytical compounds
is layered. The chemical composition of the particles,
the structure of the surface, the morphology, the
particle size and the particle size distribution of such a
carrier are of major significance for the activity of the
catalyst and the properties of the polymer to be obtained.
With a very active catalyst, namely, polymer can be produced
from which thanks to its purity no catalyst residues need to
be removed. The surface structure and the morphology of the 
carrier, on the other hand, affect on the morphology of the
polymerization product itself, for it has been noticed that
the morphology of the catalyst is repeated in the structure
of the polymer (the so-called replica phenomenon). When the
aim is a flowing product polymer having the desired
morphology and a narrow particle size distribution, which is
desirable in view of the objects of use of many of the
processing processes, the properties of the carrier should,
because of the replica phenomenon, be made corresponding.The catalysts of the above-mentioned type are nowadays often
formed of magnesium based carrier substance, which has been
treated with a transition metal compound like titanium
halide and often also with an electron donor compound. It is
also known that a carrier can be brought into a preferred
chemical composition having a certain
