<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the reaction of residual chlorine contents in hydrogen containing 
water vapour and hydrogen chloride to form hydrogen chloride. The hydrogen formed when hydrochloric acid is electrolysed in 
diaphragm cells is saturated with water vapour and hydrogen 
chloride. It also contains chlorine in an amount of the 
order of about 2 volumes % which has diffused through the 
diaphragm due to the slight excess pressure on the chlorine 
side. The required working up of hydrogen therefore includes 
not only cooling from the temperature of 70 to 80°C, at which 
the hydrogen leaves the electrolytic cell, to about 35°C, at 
which most of the hydrogen chloride remains in the condensed 
water, but also alkaline washing with sodium hydroxide 
solution which removes the chlorine as well as the residual 
hydrogen chloride, an aqueous solution of sodium 
hypochloride/sodium chloride known as chlorine bleach being 
thereby produced (e.g. Ullman, Vol. AG, fifth edition, 1988, 
p.460). If there is no user for the chlorine bleach, the 
chlorine may be retained by acidification but this process 
has the disadvantage, apart from the additional consumption 
of acid, that it gives rise to effluent polluted with salts. In US 4,999,174 a process for the removal of chlorine from reducing gases is provided wherein the 
reducing gases are contacted with cerium oxyde. According to the US-Patent the chlorine reacts 
with the cerium catalyst forming CeCl3, which need to be regenerated quite often. The regeneration 
of the cerium catalyst makes the process of the US-Patent expensive. It has now been found that the formation of chlorine bleach 
and hence the need for its decomposition can to a large 
extent be avoided by passing the chlorine-containing hydrogen 
gas from the electrolytic cell over a platinum or palladium 
catalyst under the process conditions described below so that 
the chlorine reacts with hydrogen to form hydrogen chloride. 
This is then separated off together with the hydrogen 
chloride which was already present, whereby the sodium 
hydroxide consumption is substantially reduced.  
 The present invention is suitable in particular for the removal of residual chlorine 
contents from gas mixtures which are formed on the catholyte side when aqueous 
hydrochloric acid is electrolytically decomposed in electrolytic diaphragm cells 
and which in addition to containing hydrogen contain up to 3 volumes % of 
chlorine as well as water vapour and hydrogen chloride in amounts depending on 
the
