<ABSTRACT>
The clutch operating device has a setting drive (9) for the friction clutch (3) operated in dependence on a number of monitored engine operating parameters e.g. the engine revs, the vehicle velocity, the position of the accelerator pedal, or the selected gear ratio. The vehicle drive slip regulation system responding to the detected wheel velocities, supplies a signal for the clutch operating device when the delivered drive force is reduced, for maintaining it in a given position independent of one of the operating parameters, or for adjusting the operating rate of the friction clutch relative to the operating rate when the control signal is not supplied. Pref. the setting drive is coupled to a control circuit (11) receiving input signals from a number of sensors (13,...21) for monitoring different operating parameters and operating the clutch during setting off and gear changing according to defined programmes.

Arrangement for actuating a friction clutch of a 
motor vehicle driven by an internal combustion 

engine and equipped with a driving slip regulating 
arrangement comprising
 
an actuating drive for the friction clutch,
 
a number of sensors responding to operating 

parameters of the vehicle, in particular the 
rotational speed of its engine and/or the input 

speed and/or gear position of its gearbox coupled to 
the engine through a friction clutch and/or the 

position of its accelerator pedal and/or the road 
speed,
 
a clutch control disengaging the friction clutch by 

means of the actuating drive independently of the 
sensors and automatically engaging it both on 

starting of the vehicle and also on a change of gear 
in the gearbox,
 
the driving slip regulating arrangement detecting by 

means of further sensors, in particular wheel speed 
sensors, an existing or threatened driving slip 

situation and thereupon producing a first control 
signal for reducing the driving power of the engine 

as well as a second control signal delivered to the 
clutch control,
characterised in that
, the driving 
slip regulating arrangement produces the second 

control signal during the duration of the reduction 
in driving power and holds the actuating drive in 

the position which existed at the start of the 
second control signal during the presence of the 

second control signal either independently of the 
speed of the engine and/or road speed detected by  

 
one of the sensors, or, dependent on the sensors 

which detect the operating parameters, it controls 
it in the position associated with the ope
rating 
situation at an adjusting rate which is reduced in 

comparison with the adjusting rate of the actuating 
drive in the absence of the second control signal.
