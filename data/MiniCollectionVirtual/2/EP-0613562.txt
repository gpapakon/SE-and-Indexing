<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monitoring organ function. One function of 
some organs, such as for example the kidney or the liver, is removal of 
substances from body fluids. The performance of such a clearance organ 
can be determined by assaying for accumulation in body fluids of a 
substance that is expected to remain constant or to deplete, or by 
monitoring the clearance by the organ of a labelled substance from the body 
fluids, for example. The kidney is one such clearance organ that removes substances from 
body fluids. Acute renal failure ("ARF") as a complication of medical, 
obstetrical and multiple surgical conditions represents an important health 
problem. Currently patients suffering from ARF have a survival rate of 
about 50%. The pathogenesis of renal failure remains undefined, and there 
are no clear approaches for its prevention and treatment. In the early 
stages of renal failure patients show no symptoms and feel no discomfort. 
Diagnosis can be made by analyzing the body fluids to determine whether 
the kidneys are maintaining the expected levels of one or more substances. Because ofthe abruptness ofthe renal impairment in patients having 
ARF, their clinical status following the onset of renal failure is determined 
largely by their prior state of health and the nature of the insult that led 
to the renal failure. Hypoperfusion of the kidney is a frequently recognized 
insult leading to ARF in the setting of trauma, surgery, hemorrhage or 
dehydration. Continuous and precise monitoring of the cardiopulmonary 
function in such settings has long been available and has helped in 
restoring the normal circulatory status of the acute patient, but estimation 
of the renal function conventionally is carried out by such relatively crude 
means as measurement of urine output and determination of plasma 
creatinine level. Such standard methods are inadequate for monitoring 
renal function in the acute patient. Although the kidney is capable of virtually complete recovery after  
 
an episode of hypoperfusion, transient ischemia or toxin-induced cellular 
destruction can suppress urine formation for days or even weeks. Current 
methods of measuring renal function have poor time resolution, and 
undetected or late-detected renal failure accounts for substantial mortality. 
There is at present no reliable method for continuous and near real-time 
monitoring of renal function. Renal function is conventionally determined by measuring the levels 
of substances in the urine or the serum, or both.

<CLAIMS>
A method for measuring depletion of a detectable 
substance from a subject's body, comprising 


providing a detectable substance to a subject, said 
detectable substance capable of equilibrating in a 

subject's extracellular fluid, 
allowing said detectable substance to equilibrate in 
said subject's extracellular fluid forming equilibrated 

extracellular fluid, 
situating a detector (4) on a portion of said 
subject's body having a defined constant volume of said 

equilibrated extracellular fluid, 
enclosing said detector (4) and said portion of said 
subject's body in a barrier (3) that is substantially 

opaque to said detectable substance such that only said 
defined constant volume of said equilibrated extracellular 

fluid within said body portion is detected by said detector 
(4), 
measuring a response of said detector (4) to said 
equilibrated detectable substance, said response indicative 

of the quantity of said detectable substance within said 
defined constant volume of said equilibrated extracellular

determining the depletion of said detectable substance 
from a change in quantity of said substance measured within  

 
said defined constant volume of said equilibrated 

extracelluar fluid. 
A method for measuring a clearance function of an 
organ in a subject comprising 


providing a detectable substance to a subject, said 
detectable substance capable of equilibrating in a 

subject's extracellular fluid, 
allowing said detectable substance to equilibrate in 
said subjects extracellular fluid forming equilibrated 

extracellular fluid, 
situating a detector (4) on a portion of said 
subject's body having a defined constant volume of said 

equilibrated extracellular fluid, 
enclosing said detector (4) and said portion of said 
subject's body in a barrier that is substantially opaque to said 

detectable substance such that only said defined constant 
volume of said equilibrated extra cellular fluid within 

said enclosed body portion is detected by said detector (4) 
measuring a response of said detector (4) to said

is detectable by detecting radiation from said detectable 

substance and wherein the step of situating said detector 
(4) on the portion of the subjects's body having a defined

A method as claimed in claim 1 comprising

subject,
