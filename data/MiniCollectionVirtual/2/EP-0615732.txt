<ABSTRACT>
Headless bioabsorbable interference screw, of the type comprising an axial throughbore (10), the majority (10a) of which is made in the form of a hollow prism, the remaining part constituting a cylindrical hole (10b). The interference screw is made from a stereocopolymer of lactic acid of high chemical purity, comprising at least 90% of L-lactic acid derivative units, a mass greater than 250,000 and a polydispersity index of less than 2.

<CLAIMS>
A headless bioresorbable interference screw, of the
type comprising a through axial bore (10), the major part

(10a) of which is produced in the form of a hollow prism,
the remaining part constituting a cylindrical hole (lOb),

produced from a lactic acid stereocopolymer with high
chemical purity, 
characterised in that
 it contains at least
90% units derived from L-lactic acid, a mass greater than

250,000 and a polydispersity index of less than 2.
An interference screw according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 it comprises a thread (12) with a
rounded profile with a flank angle of around 30Â° and a

radius of curvature at the top (r) less than that of the
bottoms of the curve (R) in order to ensure good mechanical

stability.
An interference screw according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 the hollow prism (10a) fits within a
circle whose diameter represents 70% to 80% of the diameter

of the core of the screw (1) in order to preserve a
sufficient quantity of plastics material around the said

prism so as to ensure transmission of the torque without
impairing its geometry.
An interference screw according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 its constituent material contains at
least 95% units derived from L-lactic acid.
An interference screw according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 it is injection moulded.
