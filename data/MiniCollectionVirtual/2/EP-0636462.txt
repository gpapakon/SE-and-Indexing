<ABSTRACT>
A device for manufacturing corrugated tubes from thermoplastic material comprises a moulding section (19), which is arranged adjoining a die head of an extruder and has a guide which is arranged in a frame (1) and on which mould halves (17, 18) provided on their underside with racks (60) and closed in pairs in a run-in to form annular moulds are advanced in close succession, comprising at least one drive pinion (23, 24) which is arranged in the initial region of the moulding section (19) and meshes with the racks (60) of the pushed-together mould halves (17, 18), and comprises a run-out (B), which follows the moulding section (19) and in which the mould halves (17, 18) are separated from one another and are transferred onto return sections (20, 21), which are separate from each other and on which the said mould halves are returned by conveying means to the run-in (A). To make it possible for the mould halves (17, 18) to be introduced in the run-in in an alternating manner without any collisions and for the mould halves (17, 18) to be correspondingly withdrawn in the run-out (B) of the moulding section (19) without colliding, the conveying means comprise driven pinions which successively come into engagement with the racks (60) of the mould halves (17, 18). The transverse conveyance of the mould halves (17, 18) between the run-out (B) and the run-in (A) is performed by pinions (47) driven with transverse movement.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the manufacture of corrugated tubes from thermoplastic 
material, comprising 


a shaping path adjoining the head of an extruder, composed of a guide arranged 
in a frame structure, along which, in an inlet, mold halves closed together 

in pairs as annular molds are advanced in close succession, said mold 
halves being provided on a lower side thereof with racks, 
at least one drive pinion arranged on the initial part of the shaping path for 
meshing with the racks of the pushed-together mold halves, and 
an outlet, following the shaping path, at which the mold halves are separated 
from each other and are transferred to mutually separate return paths, on 

which they are returned by conveying means to the inlet, 
 
characterized in that
 
the conveying means of the return paths consist of driven pinions adapted to 

come into engagement in sequence with the racks of the mold halves, and in 
that the transverse conveyance of the mold halves between the outlet and the 

inlet is caused by transversely movably driven pinions. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the drivable pinions 
engaging the respective teeth of the racks on the mold halves in the inlet and 

outlet parts of the shaping path have their end surfaces, or edge disks connected 
with the end surfaces, in interlocking engagement with flanks which  

 
encircle the racks, and in that the pinions are provided with drives transversely 

conveying the same. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the edge disks possess 
a larger diameter than the pinions. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 3, characterized in 
that for each train of mold halves along the shaping path one respective drive 

pinion is provided. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 4, characterized in 
that each transversely conveying pinion is bearinged in a c
arriage adapted to 
move in guides and being provided with a drive for moving the same. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that each pinion 
bearinged in a carriage is adapted to slide on a splined shaft which is 

bearinged in a manner fixed in relation to the frame structure and is provided 
with a drive. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or in claim 6, characterized in that each 
carriage is adapted to be moved by a lead screw which is bearinged in a manner 

fixed in relation to the frame structure and is provided with a drive. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 7, characterized in 
that the mold halves are provided on upper and lower sides thereof with racks, 

and in the initial part of the shaping path drive pinions are provided for meshing 
both with the lower and also with the upper racks. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 8, characterized in 
that the mold halves are provided with oblique guide surfaces which in the exit 

part of the shaping path cooperate with corresponding oblique guide surfaces 
of the frame structure.  

 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 9, characterized in 
that along the shaping path the mold halves are supported by means of rollers 

running on lateral guide sections. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 10, characterized in 
that on upper and lower sides thereof the mold halves are provided with rollers 

or freely rotatably supported balls adapted to cooperate with upper and lower 
guides or guide surfaces on the frame structure. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 11, characterized in 
that the pinions of each of the two return paths are drivingly connected with 

each other and are adapted to be driven synchronously by a common drive. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 12, characterized in 
that in an end part of the shaping path detector pinions are arranged adapted 

to mesh with the racks of each train of mold halves, shafts of such detector 
pinions being provided with measuring means detecting the position of the 

teeth of the racks. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 13, characterized in 
that the upper part of the frame structure is adapted to be raised and lowered 

in accordance with the expansion and contraction of the mold halves. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 14, characterized in 
that following the transverse conveying pinions the return paths are provided 

with parking stations for mold halves, which are able to be introduced into the 
return paths by their own drives. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 15, characterized in 
that the frame structure consists of two parts which are divided in a vertical 

longitudinal median plane and are able to be drawn apart and locked together 
in a pushed together setting thereof.  

 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 16, characterized in 
that the frame structure is adapted to slide along guides in its longitudinal direction.
