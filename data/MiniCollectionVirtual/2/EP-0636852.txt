<ABSTRACT>
The precision of the payload delivery of the basic artillery rocket (11) introduced with the MLRS system is very considerably improved if it is equipped with an inertial flight controller (15) for driving fins (25). The cost of the flight controller (15) can be kept low if it is supported by position and time data from a navigation receiver (20) with whose aid it is also possible to determine that the delivery (time) point has been reached. If the flight controller (15) together with sensors and an actuating system (17) is installed in front of the warhead, on the ogive of the rocket casing (27), the payload space is not noticeably reduced, and the front main frame (rib) (23) of the rocket structure can be used for mechanically robust fin mounting, so that it is unnecessary to have any involvement in the rear zone with the rocket motor (12). The fins (25), which are constructed as extended, heavily swept canards, are not deployed until the apogee (34) of the ballistic launch path (14) has been reached and, as a result of their additional lift, produce a transition into a greatly extended path (14') of considerably longer range (2R), in addition to more precise mission completion.

Artillery rocket (11) with a motor (12) for launching 
it into a ballistic trajectory (14) over a 

predetermined target area, via which a payload is to 
be released by means of a gas generator (21), and with 

a control system (17) for rudders (25), by means of 
which an extension of the trajectory (14') is achieved 

after flying through the ballistic apogee,
 
characterised in that the control system (17) 

including the steering gear (29) for the rudders (25) 
is installed between the front main frame (23), in the 

area where the gas generator section merges with the 
missile warhead capsule of the rocket structure, and 

an additionally installed intermediate frame (33), 
where the rudders (25) may be designed as extended 

canard-type rudders with a small span, wherein in 
addition to the gas generator (21) and the control 

system (17), the energy supply (22) thereof and a 
flight controller (15) are arranged below the ogive 

capsule (27) of the rocket (11) in front of its 
payload missile warhead, an attitude sensor (18) and a 

navigation receiver (20) being switched onto said 
flight controller (15) to provide it with current 

location coordinates. 
Rocket according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
several canard-type rudders (25) are provided. 
Rocket according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the rudders (25) engage radially 

relative to their longitudinal axis (28) into the 
capsule (27) with shaft butt ends (26).  

 
Rocket according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that several rudders (25), which may 

be adjusted independently of one another, are provided 
with their own steering gear (29). 
Rocket according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that in the launching phase, a 

transfer of target coordinates to the flight 

controller (15) and of launching coordinates to the 
navigation receiver (20) from an initialisation 

computer (19) is provided in addition to current 
disturbance variable data.
