<ABSTRACT>
The new invention, for the machining of thin metal sheets, proposes to arrange the tool top part (5) and tool bottom part (6) on horizontal guides (2, 3) in such a way as to be traversable independently of one another. Control and drive means (18-20) are provided for the coordinated movement of the two tool parts. A new "degree of freedom of motion" with a vertical adjustment of the working tools to one another is introduced. Thus any possible start of cut, even inside the sheet-metal plate (12), is possible for the first time in the machining of thin metal sheets for internal and external shapes. The configuration of the machine frame as a portal frame and of an additional thin-sheet machining unit (21) results in novel machining of thin metal sheets, which permits a technique analogous to the laser cutting technique. In fact the new thin-sheet cutting technique produces neater cuts.
