<ABSTRACT>
Heterologous polypeptides are produced in Lactococcus by means of a T7 or T7-like RNA polymerase gene placed under the control of an inducible promoter effective in the Lactococcal host, and a promoter specific for said polymerase upstream of a coding sequence for the desired polypeptide, whereby the promoter directs transcription of said coding sequence selectively as a result of expression of said polymerase. Surprisingly, the Gram-negative E. coli derived T7 RNA polymerase system works extremely well in the Gram-positive Lactococcus host. The heterologous polypeptide can be produced in high yields (e.g. 22%) as soluble intracellular protein, or can be secreted, e.g. at a rate commensurate with its expression so that only low levels or zero amount of polypeptide is accumulated intracellularly. The polypeptide within the cell, being biologically active, can be delivered in that encapsulated form, e.g. as a parenteral, topical or oral medicament or vaccine, or as an environmental pesticide. Examples of expression product are TTFC, the HIV V3 loop and B. thuringiensis toxins.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HETEROLOGOUSGENE EXPRESSION IN LACTOCOCCUS. ANDTHE EXPRESSION PRODUCTSTHEREFROM^ Field of the inventionThis invention relates to the expression of heterologous proteins in lactic acid bacteria, \ 5 and to their use in producing an immune response in an immunised subject The invention also provides certain specific expression products of considerable potential usefulness.Background to the invention . Bacteria able to produce and secrete proteins encoded by heterologous genes are10 used extensively for the industrial production of high value-added pharmaceutical proteins such as human and animal growth hormones, insulin, interferons, cytokines etc. Organisms other than E.coli thus far used or proposed for industrial production include cultured mammalian and insect cells, yeasts and fungi, and a number of Bacillus spp. Among the bacteria already widely used for industrial purposes are the lactic acid15 bacteria, which are employed as starter cultures for fermented food-stuffs, and as flavour enhancers, and preservatives. These properties depend on the ability of these organisms to produce certain enzymes, lactic acid and harmless antimicrobial polypeptides such as nisin. To date only low yields of foreign proteins have been obtained by the genetic manipulation of these organisms, and in some instances gene20 expression has depended on the use of unregulated genes, or of undefined control elements. Lactic acid -bacteria which are related to those used in food and milk fermentations are also found as commensal bacteria in the alimentary tracts of animals. There is considerable industrial interest in the genetic manipulation of both the food and the commensal bacteria. For example, recombinant strains of these bacteria could be25 used to improve fermentation processes, and as novel vectors for multi-disease vaccines.In contrast to a Gram-negative organism such as E.coli Gram-positive bacteria such as the lactic acid bacteria and Bacillus spp. have the capacity to secrete proteins more readily into the growth medium. However, the active protease systems of the best known30 bacillus species, B. subϋlis, have greatly limited the usefulness of this organism for the production of recombinant proteins. Protein secretion in Gram-positive cells differs * fundamentally from that observed in Gram-negative cells, where it is a complex two$ι stage process in which true secretion (as opposed to protein accumulation in the'" periplasmic space) requires that exported proteins should traverse both the cell35 membrane and
