<ABSTRACT>
An audio frequency modulator-demodulator device for an already existing electrical distribution network, such as in particular a domestic aerial installation, is described, which device has modulator devices which are preferably arranged in the region of the aerial head end (16), modulate numerous audio and radio programmes (in mono or stereo technology) onto a carrier and couple this modulated carrier into the aerial network (10). Demodulation and selection of one of the plurality of audio or radio programmes and passing on thereof to one or more listening points (24) are carried out by demodulator devices (22) which are coupled to the distribution network, in particular connected via the aerial sockets (12). It is also possible, in addition, optionally to select the television sound of a television programme (18) running in parallel and independently thereof.
