<ABSTRACT>
An optical card information 
recording/reproducin
g apparatus is provided for 
recording and/or reproducing information in or from an 

optical card. The apparatus comprises a mounting base 
on which the optical card is to be mounted and which 

moves in a predetermined direction, an optical head for 
irradiating an optical beam onto the optical card to 

record and/or reproduce information therein or 
therefrom, and a locking device for locking the 

mounting base in an unmovable state during 
transportation of the apparatus. The locking device 

may be arranged to lock the optical head in an 
unmovable state as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
card information recording/reproducing apparatus for
recording and/or reproducing information by irradiating
an optical beam onto a recording/reproducing surface in
an optical or magneto-optical recording medium of card
(hereinafter referred to as an optical card). More
particularly, the invention relates to an optical card
information recording/reproducing apparatus provided
with a lock mechanism for a mounting base on which the
optical card is mounted and for an optical head for
irradiating an optical beam onto the optical card to
record and/or reproduce information.An optical card information
recording/reproducing apparatus records or reproduces
information in or from an optical card, using an
optical beam such as a laser beam. The apparatus
performs the recording/reproducing of information to
the optical card while driving a mounting base
(hereinafter referred to as a shuttle) for carrying the
optical card and an optical head for irradiating the
optical beam onto the optical card in mutually 
perpendicular directions. Such apparatus had, however,
a problem that vibration on the apparatus during
transportation thereof caused the optical head and the
mounting base to collide with members at the moving end
so as to be damaged.JP-A-04-238122 discloses an optical card information
recording/reproducing apparatus including a locking
mechanism for fixing the shuttle which moves the optical
head over the medium in a loading position. A separate
locking mechanism is provided to lock the optical head
in position.The present invention has been accomplished taking
the problem into account. It is an object of the present
invention to provide an optical card information
recording/reproducing apparatus which has a simple
arrangement to enable prevention of a damage to the
optical head and/or the shuttle.According to the present invention, there is
provided an apparatus for performing at least one of the
functions of recording and reproducing information to or
from a recording medium, comprising an optical head for
irradiating the recording medium with a light beam for
performing at least one of the functions of recording and
reproducing information on or from the medium, the
optical head being movable along a surface of the
recording medium within a predetermined movable range; 
a mounting base for holding the recording medium, the
mounting base being movable in a direction perpendicular
to the direction of movement of the optical head; and
locking means for locking the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for performing at least one of the
functions of recording and reproducing information to or

from a recording medium (307; 413), comprising:

an optical head (301; 401) for irradiating the
recording medium with a light beam for performing at

least one of the functions of recording and reproducing
information on or from the medium (307; 413), the optical

head (301; 401) being movable along a surface of the
recording medium (307; 413) within a predetermined

movable range;
a mounting base (302; 402) for holding the recording
medium (307; 413), the mounting base (302; 402) being

movable in a direction perpendicular to the direction of
movement of the optical head (301; 401); and
locking means (301a, 302a; 407) for locking the
optical head (301; 401) to prevent said movement of the

optical head (301; 401),
the apparatus being characterized in that the
locking means (301a, 302a; 407) is arranged such that

when said mounting base (302; 402) is positioned in a
position for insertion or ejection of the recording

medium (307; 413), the optical head (301; 401) is locked
by the mounting base (302; 402).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
locking means (301a, 302a) includes: 


a first projecting portion (302a) provided on the
mounting base (302); and
a second projecting portion (301a) provided on the
optical head (301),
wherein when the mounting base (302) and said
optical head are each positioned at positions enabling

insertion or ejection of the recording medium (307), the
first projecting portion (302a) is arranged so as to

contact the second projecting portion (301a) thereby
preventing the second projecting portion (301a) from

moving relative to the mounting base (302) thus
preventing said movement of the optical head (301).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
locking means includes:


a locking lever (407) pivotable between a first
position where said optical head (401) is locked and a

second position where the optical head (401) is not
locked; and
a spring member (410) for biasing said locking lever
(407) toward the second position,
wherein the locking lever (407) is arranged such
that movement of the mounting base (402) causes said

locking lever (407) to pivot against the biasing force
of the spring member (410) to move the locking lever into

the first position.
An apparatus according to claim 3, wherein in said
second position a portion of said locking lever (407)

engages a projecting portion (401a) of the optical head
(401) thereby preventing said movement of the optical

head (401).
