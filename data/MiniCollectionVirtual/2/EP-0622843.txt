<ABSTRACT>
A method and the resulting product for isolating lightly 
doped silicon islands from each other and from a common 

substrate. The substrate (1) is covered with a first 
heavily doped epi layer (3). The first epi layer is covered 

with a lightly doped second epi layer (4). A pair of 
spaced deep trenches (6, 17) are provided which extend 

from the top surface of the second layer, through the 
first layer and into the substrate. The interior walls of 

the trenches are lined with an oxide layer (8). A pair of 
heavily doped reach-through diffusion regions (14, 15) 

extending from said top surface to the first layer is 
oriented perpendicularly to the deep trenches and fully 

extends between the trenches. The heavily doped reach-through 
diffusion regions (14, 15) and the contiguous 

first layer are then removed by a single anisotropic etching 
step to yield silicon islands isolated by air except 

where the islands contact the oxide-lined deep trenches. 
The air isolation preferably is partially replaced with 

other dielectric material (10, 11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to silicon-on-insulator 
semiconductor device structures and methods and, 
more particularly, to a simplified undercut etching method 
based on the use of doped reach-through regions to isolate 
such device structures from each other on the same chip. Undercut etching methods to remove selectively a buried 
doped semiconductive region to form submerged spaces for 
the insertion of insulating material are well-known in the 
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) art. The various methods differ 
in complexity particularly as to how access is gained 
to reach and remove the buried region and as to how the 
overlying region (to be isolated) is supported during the 
process of removing the buried region. For example, U.S. patent 4 888 300, issued to Gregory N. 
Burton on Dec. 19, 1989 for Submerged Wall Isolation of 
Silicon Islands, teaches the use of trenches in an 
epitaxial layer to provide access to a differently doped 
buried layer. While supporting the portion of the 
epitaxial layer adjacent the trench (by an oxide bridge), 
the underlying region of the buried layer is etched away 
to form a cavity under the active area. Five etching 
steps are disclosed to accomplish the accessing, supporting 
and removal steps for forming the cavity and for completely 
isolating the silicon islands from the substrate. 
Co-pending European patent application, application number 
92480128.5 filed on September 11, 1992 in the names of K. 
D. Beyer et al. for Buried Air Dielectric Isolation of 
Silicon Islands and assigned to the present assignee also 
utilizes trench and oxide bridging steps to provide for 
the accessing and removal of the buried region material  
 
while supporting the active area. Three etching steps are 
disclosed for forming completely isolated silicon islands. One object of the present invention is to eliminate the 
need to etch a trench, as previously taught to access and 
to remove a buried region underlying each island, in order 
to isolate each island on the same silicon chip. Another object of the present invention is to eliminate 
the need to provide an oxide bridge to support each island 
while a buried region underlying each island is removed. These and other objects of the invention are achieved by 
providing a pair of spaced deep trenches for defining one 
dimension of each silicon island to be isolated from a 
common substrate. The trenches extend from the top surface 
of a lightly doped silicon layer into the silicon 
substrate and completely through an
