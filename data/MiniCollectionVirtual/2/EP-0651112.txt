<ABSTRACT>
The railing comprises balusters or support bars (1) equipped with means (7) of attachment to the ground (6) or to a low wall, these balusters or support bars being connected together at the top of them by a handrail (2) and also, at mid-height, by rails (3, 4, 5). The balusters (1), the handrail (2) and the intermediate rails (3, 4, 5) are formed by tubular sections. The tubular sections which form the balusters (1) have at least one longitudinal channel (10) receiving the means (20) of attachment of the handrail as well as the means (17) of connecting the ends of the rails (3, 4, 5). Closures (13) close off the channels (10) and conceal the means of assembly.

Modular railing comprising stanchions or support bars (1),
provided with means (7) for fixing to the ground (6) or to a wall

(9), and connected together at their tops by a handrail (2) and
also, at intermediate heights, by one or more horizontal or

inclined rails (3, 4, 5), the stanchions or support bars (1)
being formed by tubular profiled members each having at least one

longitudinal groove (10, 35) receiving means (20, 21) of fixing
the handrail (2) and means (17; 36, 41) of connection with the

intermediate rails (3, 4, 5), the handrail (2) being fixed in the
vertical plane containing the stanchions or support bars (1),


characterised in that
 the handrail (2) and the intermediate rail
or rails (3, 4, 5) are formed by tubular profiled members, and

in that the rail or rails (3, 4, 5) are also fixed in the
vertical plane containing the stanchions or support bars (1), the

tubular profiled members which constitute the stanchions or
support bars (1) having for this purpose, at the level of the

intermediate rails (3, 4, 5), lateral openings (14) designed to
receive the ends of these rails (3, 4, 5), fixed by means of a

connecting piece (17) having parts engaged inside the ends of the
tubular profiled members constituting the said rails (3, 4, 5).
Modular railing according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the tubular profiled members constituting the stanchions or

support bars (1), the handrail (2) and the intermediate rail or
rails (3, 4, 5) have a cross section of circular shape overall.
Modular railing according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that snap-in closures (13) are provided for closing off the

longitudinal groove or grooves (10, 35) in the tubular profiled
members constituting the stanchions or support bars (1),

concealing the means of connecting the handrail (2) and
intermediate rails (3, 4, 5). 
Modular railing according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the aforementioned connecting piece (17)

has the shape of a cross, the two horizontal arms of which are
designed to be engaged in the ends of the tubular profiled

members constituting the intermediate rails (3, 4, 5), whilst its
two vertical arms fit in the longitudinal groove (10) of the

profiled member constituting the stanchion or support bar (1),
one of the vertical arms of the cross-shaped connecting piece

(17) carrying a press-screw (19), designed to bear on the bottom
of the said longitudinal groove (10), the tightening of the

press-screw (19) pressing the two horizontal arms of the cross-shaped
connecting piece (17) against the internal walls of the

tubular profiled members constituting the intermediate rails (3,
4, 5).
Modular railing according to Claim 4, characterised in that
the cross-shaped connecting piece (17) is designed to be fitted

through one of the lateral openings (14) of the tubular profiled
member constituting the stanchion or support bar (1), and through

a cutout or aperture (15, 16) formed in the wall of the
longitudinal groove (10) in this tubular profiled member.
Modular railing according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the tubular profiled members constituting
the stanchions or support bars (1) have two diametrically opposed

lateral grooves (35), designed to receive the projection (37)
and/or the fixing means (41) of a part or head (36) for

connecting the stanchion or support bar (1) with an end of an
intermediate rail (3, 4, 5).
Modular railing according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the connecting part or head (36) has an opening (38) suitable for

receiving the end of an intermediate rail (3, 4, 5) and an
elongate projection (37) designed to fit and be fixed in a

lateral groove (35) in the tubular profiled member constituting
the stanchion or support bar (1). 
Modular railing according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the opening (38) in the connecting part or head (36) has an axis

(44) which is inclined with respect to the horizontal, when the
said connecting part or head is fixed against a vertical

stanchion or support bar (1), and in that this opening (38) is
sized so as to receive the end of an intermediate rail (3, 4, 5)

with a certain amount of clearance, so as to allow the assembly
of horizontal or inclined rails (3, 4, 5).
Modular railing according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised in
that the elongate projection (37) on the connecting part or head

(36) is connected by means of screws (40) to an elongate plate
(41) slid into the lateral groove (35) in the stanchion or

support bar (1), the plate (41) preferably having a slightly
curved profile ensuring its locking in the groove (35).
Modular railing according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the handrail (2) is formed by a tubular

profiled member having a longitudinal groove (11), turned
downwards, and in that this handrail (2) is connected to the top

of a stanchion or support bar (1) by means of an intermediate
piece (20), the bottom face of which has a tenon (21) designed

to be engaged and locked in the or one longitudinal groove (10)
of the tubular profiled member constituting the stanchion or

support bar (1), and the top face of which forms a cradle (23)
on which is placed the tubular profiled member constituting the

handrail (2), the intermediate part (20) having an oblique
passage (26) opening out in the central area of the cradle (23)

and receiving a screw (27) which carries a nut (28), designed to
bear, when the screw (27) is tightened, on an edge (29) of the

longitudinal groove (11) in the tubular profiled member
constituting the handrail (2).
Modular railing according to Claim 10, characterised in that,
on the cradle (23) of the intermediate piece (20), there projects

a nose (24), on which one of the edges (25) of the longitudinal
groove (11) in the profiled member constituting the handrail (2) 

is positioned, the nose (24) immobilising, with respect to
rotation, the aforementioned nut (28), of square or rectangular

shape.
Modular railing according to any one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the means of fixing each stanchion or

support bar (1) to the ground (6) or to a wall (9) comprise a
fixing shoe (7) whose side wall delimits a recess (32) into which

the base of the stanchion or support bar (1) is inserted, the or
one longitudinal groove (10) of the tubular profiled member

constituting this stanchion or support bar (1) receiving a wedge
(33) with screw (34), the wedge (33) cooperating with the

internal wall of the shoe (7) when the screw (34) is tightened.
