difluoromethane (R-32), pentafluoroethane (R-125), 

1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), and n-pentane, preferably 
prepared by mixing n-pentane preliminarily in R-134a, and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerant
composition and a refrigerating apparatus, and more
particularly to a refrigerant composition which does not
destroy the ozone layer, is nonflammable, is compatible well
with refrigerating machine oil such as mineral oil and alkyl
benzene, and presents a stable and uniform liquid phase, and
to a refrigerating apparatus using the same.The conventional refrigerant hitherto used in the
refrigerating machine is mostly dichlorodifluoromethane
(hereinafter called R-12), or R-500 composed of an azeotropic
mixture refrigerant of R-12 and 1,1-difluoroethane
(hereinafter called R-152a). The boiling point of R-12 is
-29.65°C at atmospheric pressure, and that of R-500 is
-33.45°C, which are ideal for ordinary conventional
refrigerating apparatuses. Even when a suction temperature
into a compressor is relatively high, they have properties of
not raising the discharge temperature so high as to induce
oil sludge of the compressor. Moreover, R-12 is compatible
well with the refrigerating machine oil such as mineral oil 
of the compressor, and plays a role of returning the oil in
the refrigerant circuit into the compressor.These refrigerants, however, have a high latency of
ozone destruction, and when released into the atmosphere to
reach the ozone layer high above the earth, they destroy the
ozone layer. The ozone layer destruction is induced by
chlorine radical (C1) in the constructions of the
refrigerants. Accordingly, refrigerants not containing
chlorine radical are expected as substitute refrigerants,
such as difluoromethane (hereinafter called R-32),
pentafluoroethane (hereinafter called R-125), and
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (hereinafter called R-134a). The
boiling point of R-32 is -51.7°C at atmospheric temperature,
that of R-125 is -48.5°C, and that of R-134a is -26.0°C.These chlorine radical-free refrigerants R-32,
R-125 and R-134a are poor in compatibility with general
refrigerating machine oil such as mineral oil or alkyl
benzene, and often caused lubrication troubles of the
compressor due to worsening of returning of oil to the
compressor, or sucking refrigerants separated from oil upon
starting after shutdown, etc.Accordingly, the present inventor attempted to mix
these refrigerants which are poor in compatibility with
mineral oil or alkyl benzene with n-pentane excellent in
compatibility with them, and discovered that the 
refrigerating machine oil such as mineral oil and alkyl
benzene discharged from the compressor into the refrigerant
circuit can be
