<ABSTRACT>
A loose product silo with a discharge aperture (5) located centrally in the ventilated silo base (3) and directly connected to a relaxation chamber (6, 8). The relaxation chamber comprises two parts (6, 8), the first of which (6) leads outwards from the silo discharge aperture in the manner of a channel, while the second part (8) is outside the actual silo. Only this second part (8) has the height needed for the relaxation height (9) of the product and is fitted with ventilation and discharge devices. The ventilation conduct (14) from the upper silo space may be taken directly to the dust removing device (11) outside the silo which is allocated to the ventilation devices of the relaxation chamber.
