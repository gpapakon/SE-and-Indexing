<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid composition
used for power transmission in a fluid coupling, and more
particularly to a fluid composition for a fluid coupling,
which is excellent in viscosity stability and torque
stability. The fluid composition according to the present
invention is particularly suitable for use as a viscous
fluid for a viscous coupling.A device in which mechanical power is converted to
fluid power, and the fluid power is returned to the
mechanical power to perform power transmission is called a
hydraulic power transmission. A fluid coupling is a kind
of hydraulic power transmission. Examples of the fluid
coupling include those having various structures and
actions. A viscous coupling is used in a power
transmission device for a differential limiting-device for
automobile, a differential gear for four-wheel drive car
or a cooling fan for an automobile engine, or the like.The viscous coupling is a device in which disks
(plates) or cylinders separately connected to input and 
output shafts are arranged in such a manner that gaps
therebetween are sufficiently narrow, and power is
transmitted by shearing force based on the viscosity of a
fluid in the gaps.The viscous coupling is a sort of liquid clutch,
which permits smooth slide. A typical specific structure
thereof is constructed in such a manner that plural inner
plates arranged movably on the side of a drive shaft
(input shaft) and plural outer plates fixed on the side of
a driven shaft (output shaft) are alternately combined
with each other, and individual gaps between the
alternately combined plates are held at regular intervals
by spacers such as separate rings. These plates are
contained in a housing in which a viscous fluid for
transmitting torque is filled. The viscous fluid is
filled in the spaces between the plural plates.The viscous coupling servers to generate viscous
torque in the spaces between the plates when a difference
in revolution speed between the drive shaft and the driven
shaft arises, and torque is transmitted on the side of the
driven shaft in proportion to the viscous torque generated
owing to the difference in revolution speed.As the viscous fluid, silicone oil is generally
used. Specifically, polyorganosiloxanes such as dimethyl
polysiloxane (i.e., dimethyl silicone oil) and
methylphenyl polysiloxane (i.e., methylphenyl silicone 
oil) are used as the silicone oil. These
polyorganosiloxanes are good in heat resistance and
oxidation resistance compared with other base oils and
moreover in
