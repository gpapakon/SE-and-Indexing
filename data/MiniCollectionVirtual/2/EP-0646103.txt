<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein are boron trifluoride etherate complexes in which the ether of the complex has at least one tertiary carbon bonded to an ether oxygen. The etherates are useful for polymerizing a one-olefin or mixtures thereof, preferably comprising isobutylene, whereby the resulting polymer contains a high percentage (80-100 %) vinylidene character.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the polymerization of 1-olefin 
containing feedstocks. Generally speaking, polymerization of 1-olefin containing feedstocks 
using catalysts such as aluminum chloride and boron trifluoride is disclosed 
extensively in the patent and technical literature. It is well known that the 
termination step in isobutylene polymerization results in a "terminal" double 
bond which imparts desired reactivity to the polymer for subsequent reactions, 
such as epoxidization or reaction with maleic anhydride. However, a problem 
exists in that the termination step can place the terminal double bond in a 
highly reactive external 1, 1-disubstituted position (hereafter "vinylidene"), or in 
a much less reactive intemal tri-substituted or tetra-substituted position. These 
three possible terminal double bond positions are shown below.  
 
Referring to this problem, Samson U.S. Patent 4,605,808 states that the 
product obtained upon conventional polymerization of isobutylene is generally 
a mixture of polymers having a high proportion of internal versus external 
(vinylidene) unsaturation due to "in situ" isomerization of the more highly 
reactive vinylidene double bond to the less reactive internal positions. The 
diminished reactivity of the hindered internal tri-substituted or tetra-substituted 
double bond is most notably observed in the manufacture of the valuable 
intermediate polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride ("PIBSA") which is obtained by 
reaction of maleic anhydride with polybutene. PIBSA is a very important 
intermediate in the manufacture of fuel and lubricant additives. The lowered 
reactivity of polybutene due to the presence of substantial internal olefinicity 
reduces the yield of PIBSA when the polymer is reacted with maleic anhydride 
and thus dictates higher usage of polybutene than would otherwise suffice if 
the polybutene consisted mainly of vinylidene olefin. Given the above problem, it has long been an object of research in the 
area of polybutene manufacture to improve the reactivity of polybutene, 
particularly its reactivity toward maleic anhydride, by identifying catalysts or 
catalyst systems capable of polymerizing isobutylene such that the resulting 
polybutene has the highest possible percentage of vinylidene double bonds. A number of patents have sought to address this very problem. Nolan 
U.S. Patent 3,166,546 discloses a vapor phase process for isobutylene 
polymerization which requires using a mixture of gaseous boron trifluoride and 
sulfur
