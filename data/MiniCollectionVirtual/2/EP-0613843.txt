<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a belt-like conveyor and/or transmission element (conveyor belt 1, toothed belt 7) with a component of ferro-magnetic material (5) which can be used as a marking for initiating controlled operations and which can be embedded in a string-like elastic plastic carrier (flat belt 6, round cord 3) and can be fastened to the belt-like conveyor and/or transmission element (conveyor belt 1, toothed belt 7). It is thus possible to apply controlled commands, which can be varied constantly, to such conveyor and/or transmission elements by magnetisation. The conveyor and/or transmission elements then perform a control function in addition to the conveyor and transmission function.

A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) with a ferromagnetic 
material (5), which contains information to be applied by magnetisation, 


characterised in that
 the ferromagnetic material (5) is embedded as a filler in a 
strand-like carrier (3, 6) comprising an elastic, thermoplastics material and which 

is welded or bonded to the conveying and/or driving element (1) and is made from 
particles of iron, or an iron alloy, or iron oxide, or chromium dioxide, or 

ferromagnetic oxides. 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the strand-like carrier is a flat belt (6) or a round cord (3). 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to Claim 1 and 
Claim 2, characterised in that the thermoplastics material of the carrier (3, 6) has 

a lower melting point than the thermoplastics material of the conveying and/or 
driving element (1), which is especially constructed as a toothed belt (7). 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to Claims 1 or 3, 
characterised in that the strand-like carrier and the conveying and/or driving 

element (1) are made from the same material. 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the melting point of the conveying and/or driving element (1) 

is 155°C and that of the strand-like plastics material is 145°C. 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to any one or 
more of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the strand-like carrier is made from 

PVC with smelting point of 120°C. 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to any one or  
 

more of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the cut edges (2) of the conveying 
and/or driving element (1) are bevelled for enlarging the contact face. 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to any one or 
more of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the diameter of the round cord (3) 

corresponds to the total thickness of the conveying and/or driving element (1). 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to any one or 
more of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the round cord (3) completely covers 

the cut edge (2) following welding. 
A belt-like conveying and/or driving element (1) according to any one or 
more of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the contact face of the conveying 

and/or driving element (1) is not deformed during welding or bonding.
