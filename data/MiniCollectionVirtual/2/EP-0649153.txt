<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ionconductive
polymer electrolyte and an aluminum
electrolytic capacitor configured with the same
electrolyte as an electrolyte for driving the electrolytic
capacitor.Conventionally, as an electrolyte for driving an
aluminum electrolytic capacitor, a solution prepared by
dissolving an ammonium salt in an organic solvent having a
high dielectric constant such as ethylene glycol has been
used. However, there has been a possibility of leakage
and evaporation of the electrolyte in the capacitor when
such liquid electrolyte is used, and hence it has been
impossible to obtain a reliability in operation for a long
period of time.In order to solve these problems, there has been
proposed an electrolytic capacitor that is free from the
leakage and evaporation of the electrolyte. Such a
capacitor is configured by solidifying its capacitor 
element as a result of employing an ion-conductive polymer
electrolyte composed of a mixture of siloxane-alkylene
oxide coplymer and polyethylene oxide, as its prepolymer,
and an alkali metal salt, instead of the liquid
electrolyte.However, the electrolytic capacitor using, as
its electrolyte, the ion-conductive polymer electrolyte
with alkali metal ions as its mobile ions has such a
disadvantage that the alkali metal ions are liable to
diffuse into a dielectric substance layer formed on a
positive electrode of the electrolytic capacitor, and the
thus diffused alkali metal ions might sometimes cause a
lowering of the dielectric constant of the dielectric
substance layer, and finally invite a short-circuit in the
capacitor.In order to overcome such disadvantages and
deficiencies, it has been considered to use ammonium ions
in place of the alkali metal ions which had been used as
the mobile ions of the electrolyte constituting the
electrolytic capacitor. However, it has hitherto been
known that the ion-conductive polymer electrolyte which
contains the ammonium ions has a very low ionic
conductivity in general.The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte
constituting the electrolytic capacitor acts as an
impedance of the capacitor, and when the ion conductivity 
of the electrolyte is too small, the impedance of the
capacitor becomes large and it is difficult to use in
practical point of view.In order to enable an employment of such ionconductive
polymer electrolyte as the electrolyte for
driving an electrolytic capacitor, it is an essential
factor to clarify a suitable combination of various
polymer mother ingredients (prepolymers) with ammonium
salt
