<CLAIMS>
Drive and brake arrangement for a vehicle including 

at least one drive motor (7), of a vehicle concerned, 
which is dependent on an adjustment of a pedal (11), 
a forwards-backwards selection device (15) which sets 
a direction of drive-rotation, 
means of recording speed of a vehicle concerned, 
a frictional-brake arrangement (17) acting on at least 
one wheel (9) of a vehicle, 
an adjustment drive (23) which controls braking force 
of a frictional-brake arrangement (17), 
an electronic control (25), which pilots an adjustment 
drive (23) into a brake-setting if means (27) 

associated with a said control (25) record an actual 
direction of movement of a vehicle which is opposite 

to that chosen on a selection device (15), 
 
wherein motors which drive a vehicle are developed as 

electromotors (7) and an electronic control (25) also 
pilots an adjustment drive (23) into a brake-setting if 

a pedal (11) is placed in a specific drive-setting for 
more than a set period of time and, simultaneously, a 

recorded speed of movement is zero.  
 
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1 or 2, wherein 
means (27) are associated with a control (25) and these 

means record a driving torque applied by an electromotor 
(7) or electromotors (7) and a control (25) pilots an 

adjustment drive (25) into a brake-release setting if a 
recorded driving torque is larger than a set value. 
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1 or 2, wherein 
means (27) are associated with a control (25) and record 

data, which represent a retaining torque applied by an 
electromotor (7) or electromotors (7), and store 

recorded torque-data in a data-memory (29), and a 
control (25) pilots an adjustment drive (23) into a 

brake release setting if a driving torque which exceeds 
a stored value of a retaining torque is introduced on a 

pedal (11). 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein a control (25) only pilots an adjustment drive 

into a brake-release position if a pedal (11) is 
positioned in a drive setting and a selected direction 

of movement and an actual direction of movement agree. 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein a control (25) pilots an adjustment drive 

(23) into a brake-release setting, with a variable 
adjustment speed corresponding to a set characteristic 

curve which is time-dependent and/or dependent on a 
setting of a pedal (11) and/or dependent on a change of 

travelling-speed of a vehicle. 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein means are associated with a control (25) and 

said means record data, which represent a retaining-torque, 
applied by an electromotor (7) or electromotors  

 
(7), and a braking torque introduced on a manually 

operated device (19) of a frictional brake arrangement 
(17), when a vehicle is at rest, and record torque data 

in a data-memory (29), and a control (25) pilots an 
adjustment drive (23) into a brake setting in which a 

braking torque of a frictional brake arrangement (17) is 
equal to or larger than a torque corresponding to stored 

torque data. 
Arrangement in accordance with claim 6, wherein a 
control (25) pilots an adjustment drive ((23) into 

brake-setting in which a braking torque of a frictional 
brake arrangement (17) is greater by a set value than a 

torque corresponding to stored torque data. 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein a control (25) pilots an adjustment drive (23) 

into a set brake-setting in which a braking torque is 
lower than a maximum braking torque of a frictional 

brake arrangement (17). 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 6 to 9, 
wherein a control (25), with a frictional brake 

arrangement (17) in a brake setting, pilots a said 
frictional brake arrangement (17) into a setting of 

maximum braking torque if, with a pedal (11) in an idle 
position, a recorded speed is greater than zero. 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 9, 
wherein a control (25) is associated with secret key 

information or key- recognition means (31, 33), and a 
said control (25) only pilots an adjustment dr
ive (23) 
into a brake release setting where there is recognition.  

 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 
10, wherein an adjustment drive (23) is associated with 

a store of energy (35), a spring-based one in 
particular, or a fluid pressure reservoir and a said 

adjustment drive (23) draws energy, necessary for 
adjusting a brake setting of a frictional brake 

arrangement, from an energy store (35). 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 
11, wherein a backwards/forwards selection device (15), 

which sets a direction of drive rotation of an 
electromotor (7) or electromotors (7), is provided, and 

means (25) are provided which allow change in a 
direction of drive rotation of an electromotor (7) or 

electromotors (7) when there is a change in a setting or 
a selection device (15), after recording of a state of 

rest of a vehicle and/or after a control has piloted an 
adjustment drive (23) into a brake setting. 
Arrangement in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 
12, wherein electromotors (7) drive separate wheels and 

are combined in one component with wheel-brakes (17) of 
wheels (9) driven.
