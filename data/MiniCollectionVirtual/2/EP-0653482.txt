<ABSTRACT>
Stable liquid aqueous bleaching compositions are disclosed 
which comprise hypochlorite and a specific complexing agent 

or mixtures thereof selected from the group of 
polycarboxylic acid derivatives of pyridine or salts 

thereof. The compositions have a pH as is of from 11.5 to 
14, and further comprise a Ca/Mg precipitation system. A 

method of treating fabrics with said compositions is also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid bleaching
composition which is suitable for laundry applications.
More specifically, the compositions
herein can be used in laundry applications as pre-wash
bleaching compositions.Liquid bleaching compositions are well known in the art.
Amongst the different bleaching compositions available,
those relying on bleaching by hypochlorite are often
preferred, mainly for whiteness performance reasons. See,
for example, WO-A-88-05461 which discloses an aqueous
composition comprising hypochlorite, sodium carbonate and
sodium hydroxide and the use of said composition for
removing stains from the fabrics.However, the drawbacks associated with the use of chlorine-based
compositions are that said compositions may both
damage and yellow fabrics. It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a hypochlorite-containing composition, suitable for
use in laundry, whereby the yellowing of the fabrics is
reduced or eliminated.It is a further object of the present invention to provide
a hypochlorite-containing composition, suitable for use in
laundry, whereby fabric safety is improved.It is another object of the present invention to provide a
hypochlorite-containing composition, suitable for use in
laundry, whereby the hypochlorite stability is improved.We have now found that the presence of some metal ions such
as Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, Pd, Pt, Cr, Hg, Ir, and Fe adversely
affects both hypochlorite bleaching performance and
stability. It is believed that in the washing environment
said metal ions catalyze the attack of hypochlorite on
fabrics with the generation of yellow oxidized species.
Said metal ions also lead to reduced tensile strength of
the fabrics, thereby reducing fabrics resistance. It is
further believed that said metal ions are adsorbed per se
on oxidized fabrics as colored species and catalyze the
degradation of the brighteners adsorbed on fabrics
generating thereby highly colored species on fabrics.
Also, said metal ions stabilize colored pigments of
enzymatic stains such as blood or grass. Furthermore, it
is believed that said metal ions are detrimental for the
performance of a hypochlorite composition as they tend to
react with the hypochlorite present in said composition and
thereby catalyze the decomposition of said hypochlorite.Therefore we have found that it is essential that levels of
said metal ions are controlled both in said composition as
is and in the bleaching environment, thereby providing
improved whiteness performance and safety to fabric
