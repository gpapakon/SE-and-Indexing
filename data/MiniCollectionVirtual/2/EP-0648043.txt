<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a picture signal enhancement circuit including
means for measuring a histogram and a non-linear processing circuit coupled to the
measuring means for enhancing the picture signal in dependence upon the measured
histogram. The invention also relates to a display apparatus provided with such a picture
signal enhancement circuit.A picture signal enhancement circuit of the type described in the opening
paragraph is generally known. In this circuit the amplitude range of the picture signal
can be divided into a number of histogram segments, whereafter it is determined by
means of a measurement per histogram segment how often a pixel value or how long
the picture signal occurs with an amplitude in the relevant histogram segment.
Subsequently, the picture signal can be processed by means of a non-linear circuit
having a transfer characteristic which is based on the integral of the histogram: per
histogram segment the picture signal is amplified by a factor which depends on the
contents of the relevant measured histogram segment. In analog embodiments, the non-linear
processing circuit is constituted by a non-linear amplifier, and in digital
embodiments the non-linear processing circuit involves a memory which is used as a
look-up table. Until now, such picture signal enhancement techniques have led to a
picture enhancement which is not satisfactory enough, so that they have not been
generally introduced.US-A 4,516,167 discloses a compression of the dynamic range of video
signals. Video signals are subjected to two-dimensional high-pass spatial filtering as a
first step in reducing their dynamic range. Then, in a second step of the compression
process, differentiation spikes generated in response to edges of large objects in the
original video signal are suppressed. This is done in real time using an adaptive non-linear
amplifier, the gains of which in a number of amplitude zones are controlled by a
histogram of the high-pass filtered video signals.EP-A-0,516,083 discloses a gradation corrector for use in a television
receiver which can subject the signal at any luminance level to non-linear correction to
provide optimum image quality. A first memory stores therein a luminance histogram of
the input signal. On the basis of the data, a first circuit detects a total frequency, a
second circuit detects a luminance distribution, and a third circuit detects the expanse of
the luminance distribution. A fourth circuit calculates a fixed value to be added. 
Further, a fifth circuit detects a
