<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a 
polyurea resin or a polyurethane-urea resin, and more 
particularly to a process for preparing an elastomer 
suitable for use in the preparation of paints, adhesives, 
fiber, synthetic leathers, etc. which has improved workability 
and provides a resin having improved physical 
properties. Processes for preparing polyurea resins are 
disclosed in the specifications of JP-A-56-135514 (the term 
"JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published 
Japanese patent application"), JP-B-60-32641 (the term "JP-B" 
as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent 
publication") and JP-B-64-2601, and processes for preparing 
polyurethane-urea resins are disclosed in the 
specifications of JP-A-50-132096, JP-B-61-54812 and U.S. 
Patent 3,681,290. Various polyamines are used in the 
preparation of these resins. Examples of aromatic amines 
conventionally used include toluenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3- or 
1,4-diaminobenzene, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, 
methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), 4-chloro-3,5-diaminobenzoic 
isobutyl ester, trimethylenebis(4-aminobenzoate) and 1,4-diamino-2,3-diphenylbutane.  Examples of aliphatic amines conventionally used 
include propylenediamine, tetramethylenediamine, 
pentamethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, trimethylhexamethylenediamine 
and polyalkylenepolyamines. Of these amine compounds, the aromatic amines are 
used as the chain lengthening agents of urethane 
prepolymers or cross linking agents because they have such 
properties that the mechanical strength, hardness or heat 
resistance of the resulting resins can be improved. 
However, the aromatic amines have a high melting point, and 
hence the mixing thereof with polyisocyanate compounds must 
be conducted at a high temperature (approximately from 60 
to 100°C), and curing must also be conducted at a high 
temperature to accelerate curing. Among the aliphatic amine compounds, those having a 
low molecular weight are liquid at ordinary temperature. 
However, the reaction rate of the amine compounds having a 
low molecular weight with polyisocyanates is rapid, and it 
is not preferred that the amine compounds are used to 
obtain curable resins which require flexibility. Among the 
aliphatic amines, conventional polyalkylenepolyamines can 
be used to prepare curable resins ranging from resins 
having flexibility to resins having a high hardness. 
Accordingly, they are used as starting materials for  
 
polyurea resins and curing agents for urethane prepolymers. 
However, they
