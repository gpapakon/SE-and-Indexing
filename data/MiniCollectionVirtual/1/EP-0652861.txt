<ABSTRACT>
The compounds of formula (I), wherein the symbol X denotes a -CHO group or an acetal group of formula (a), the symbols R', taken alone, each denote a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated C1 - C4 hydrocarbon radical or, taken together, denote an optionally substituted C1 - C4 alkylene radical, and the symbol R denotes a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical, are useful as perfuming ingredients for the preparation of perfuming compositions and perfume articles, to which they impart floral-type scents.

Compound of formula 

 
wherein symbol X represents a - CHO group or an acetal group of formula 


 
in which symbols R', taken separately, represent each a C
1
 to C
4
, linear or 
branched, saturated or unsaturated, hydrocarbon radical or, taken together, 

represent a C
1
 to C
4
 alkylene radical, optionally substituted, and symbol R 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical. 
3-(4-tert-Butyl-2-methyl-1-phenyl)propanal. 
Use of a compound according to claim 1 or 2 as a perfuming 
ingredient. 
Perfuming composition or perfumed article containing as active 
ingredient a compound according to claim 1 or 2. 
Perfumed article according to claim 4, in the form of a perfume 
or a cologne, a soap, a bath or shower gel, a shampoo or an after-shampoo 

product, a cosmetic preparation, a body or air deodorant, a detergent or fabric 
softener, or a household product. 
Process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) 
according to claim 1, characterized in that an alcohol of formula 


 
wherein symbol R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical, is reacted 

with an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the alcohol function into  
 

aldehyde, in an inert organic solvent, to provide an aldehyde of formula (I) 
and in that, if necessary, the latter is then acetalyzed in a generally known 

manner. 
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the alcohol of 
formula (II) is obtained by hydrogenolysis, in the presence of a catalyst, of an 

oxepine of formula 

 
wherein symbol R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical. 
Compound of formula 

Compound of formula 

 
wherein symbol R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical. 
Process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) 
according to claim 1, characterized in that an aldehyde of formula 


 
wherein R has the meaning indicated in formula (I), is subjected to catalytic 

hydrogenation in an inert organic solvent and, if necessary, the aldehyde 
thus obtained is acetalyzed in a generally known manner.  

 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that aldehyde (IV) 
is 3-(4-tert-butyl-1-phenyl)-2-propenal, which is obtained by reacting 4-tert-butyl-1-(dimethoxymethyl)-2-methylenebenzene 

with ethyl vinyl ether, in 
the presence of zinc chloride and phosphoric acid. 
Compound of formula 

 
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical.
