<ABSTRACT>
A system for eliminating the effects of transmission errors in a 
digital stream is disclosed. 
It is characterized by the presence of a predictor: in case of 
error, the listening is changed over the predicted signal; when 

the received signal becomes usable again, the listening switches 
from the predicted signal to the received signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for processing analog 
signals transmitted in a digital form, temporarily affected by 
transmission errors as described in the preamble of claim 1. During transmission, it may easily happen that disturbances are 
induced on signals so that they cannot be used in reception, 
particularly when the disturbance is prolonged. One of the simplest methods of eliminating transmission errors is 
to silence the channel as long as noise is present. Another method used is to repeat the last received correct value. 
Although these methods are effective, the output is either 
missing or not compensated, hence other types of disturbances are 
introduced into the channel and a rough reconstruction of the 
original signal is anyway carried out. The European Patent Application No. 83304418.3 discloses a system 
in which the last valid value is stored, the first and second 
derivatives are computed and the estimated slope of the signal 
affected by error is reconstructed from these. In so doing, it is necessary to delay the channel in order to be 
able to store information and carry out the operations. Moreover, 
these operations, which are carried out only on the basis of the 
values just preceding the disturbance and do not take into 
account the waveform of the received signal, could interpret 
uncorrectly the waveform of the signal itself. A method more effective than the previous ones, uses a technique 
of interpolating between the valid samples respectively preceding  
 
and following the error-affected one, to obtain the interpolated 
value. With this technique, it is necessary to introduce in the channel 
a considerable delay to be able to allow the storage of 
information relative to the signal that precedes and follows the 
error sequence, and to carry out the consequent calculations, 
which in this case would be no longer reliable enough. Therefore, these last described methods are valid mainly for not 
prolonged errors where the introduced delay is minimum and 
results can be considered as valid. The main object of the present invention is then to provide a 
system for making the effects of the transmission error sequences 
imperceptible. Therefore the system in accordance with the invention is 
structured as set forth in claim 1. Further characteristics of the invention are set forth in the 
subclaims. By using a predictor that allows the forecast of the received 
signal evolution with good accuracy, it is not necessary to use 
information relative to valid samples

System for processing analog signals transmitted in a digital 
form (14, 24), temporarily affected by transmission errors, 

including : switching means (10, 20) to switch over from a 
situation of normal operation to a situation of operation in 

presence of errors and viceversa; storage means for storing 
information relative to said signal (13, 24); computing means 

for calculating the values to put in the place of samples of 
said signal (14, 24) affected by errors, using information 

stored in said storage means, characterized in that said 
computing means estimate continuously the expected values of 

the samples of said signal (14, 24). 
System according to claim 1, wherein the prediction of the 
expected values is carried out by means of a predictor (18, 

28). 
System according to claim 2, wherein the predictor (18, 28) 
is adaptive linear. 
System according to claim 1, wherein said switching means 
(10, 20) are driven by a validity signal (15, 25) of the 

received signal (14, 24). 
System according to claim 1, wherein dedicated circuits 
(19, 29) are used to obtain a change-over from a situation of 

operation in presence of errors to a situation of normal 
operation, without discontinuity. 
System according to claim 5, wherein a discontinuity 
measuring signal is filtered (19)
 and summed to said digital 
signal (14) in order to eliminate the discontinuity. 
System according to claim 5, wherein, in order to eliminate 
the discontinuity, a predictor (29) connected to said digital 

signal (24) is used and the difference between the values 
predicted by the two predictors is summed with said digital 

signal (24). 
The system of claim 1 preceded by a circuit arrangement (3) 
for signal processing, wherein the errors affect single 

samples only.

a linear interpolation between the sample preceding and the 

one following the error-affected sample.
