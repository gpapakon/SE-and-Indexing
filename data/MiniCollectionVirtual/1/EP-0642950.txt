<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatic control of the orientation of the headlights (P) of a motor vehicle as a function of the attitude variations thereof comprises:   a video camera (10) aiming towards the front of the vehicle, in the field of which the headlights of the vehicle illuminate the road, which video camera also delivers image signals containing data on back-scattering of the light from the headlights by the road, processing means (12) which receive the said image signals and can determine on the basis of the said data and of stored reference data, the variations in the orientation of the light beams emitted by the headlights with respect to a reference orientation, and capable of delivering control signals to actuator means (14) provided on the headlights.

Device for automatically controlling the orientation of the headlamps (P) of a 
motor vehicle (V) according to the trim variations of the latter, characterised in 

that it comprises: 

a video camera (10) aimed towards the front of the vehicle (V) and in the field of 
which the illuminating headlamps (P) of the vehicle illuminate the road, and 

delivering image signals containing information on the backscattering of the light 
from the headlamps by the road, 
processing means (12) receiving the said image signals and suitable for 
determining, from the said information and from stored reference information, the 

variations in orientation of the light beams emitted by the headlamps compared with 
a reference orientation, and delivering control signals to actuating means (14) in 

order to bring the orientation of the said headlamps onto the said reference 
orientation. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said processing means 
(12) take into account a plurality of light points (A, B, C) on one and the same 

column (D) on the video image (I). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the said column (D) is 
disposed in the central region of the
 video image. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 and 3, characterised in that the processing 
means (12) are suitable for determining the respective slopes of two straight lines 

(AB, BC) situated on each side of a point (B) of maximum luminance and 
representing the change in luminance of the points along the column (D) 

respectively above and below the said point of maximum luminance.  
 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the means of determining the 
slopes comprise means (12) for determining the position of two image points 

belonging to the column (D) and having equal luminances at predetermined 
fractions of the said maximum luminance. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the processing means 
(12) comprise means for comparing the two determined slopes with reference 

slopes. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the camera (10) is 
situated in a roof fitting (PF) of the vehicle.
