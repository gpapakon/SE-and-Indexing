<ABSTRACT>
Focusing attention on a new fact that a difference in
the operating margin between sub-fields becomes remarkable

when preliminary discharge is not provided for all sub-fields,
but is thinned out, the operating margin for a plasma

display panel will be improved by restricting the difference
in the operating margin.
In the case of the thinned preliminary discharge system,
particularly the dependence of maintenance blanking

characteristics on the maintenance pulse number becomes
remarkable and as a result, the operating margin difference

among the sub-fields becomes remarkable, and therefore,
parameters for blanking pulse of the sub-field during the

maintenance blanking period are set in conformity with the
maintenance pulse number (number of times of emission) for

each sub-field in order to restrain this operating margin
difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for driving
a plasma display panel, and more particularly, to a method
for driving a color plasma display panel capable of tonal
display by dividing one field into a plurality of sub-fields
to set numbers of times of emission for each sub-field to
different values.Conventionally, the tonal display on a plasma display
panel has been implemented by controlling a number of times
of discharge (emission luminance) during a maintenance
period as shown in FIG. 11. More specifically, one field (F),
which displays one screen, is repeated 50 to about 70 times
a second, whereby screens of the respective fields are stacked
by means of afterimages of a human eye and a flicker-free
natural image can be obtained. This one-field period is
divided into a plurality of sub-fields (SF), and these
sub-fields are combined by varying a maintenance pulse number
(a number of times of discharge) during the maintenance period 
of each sub-field to thereby implement tonal display.In, for example, display of 64 shades of gray, as shown
in FIG. 11, one field is constituted by six sub-fields: SF1
to SF6, and preliminary discharge period (preliminary
lighting period + blanking period) is provided at the head
of each sub-field, and subsequent to this period, there are
provided a write period and a maintenance period
respectively. The weighting is effected by reducing each
number of times of discharge during these maintenance periods
each about 1/2 at a time successively from the sub-field at
the head (in SF1, the number of times of discharge is assumed
to be 32n where n is a positive integer).When the foregoing sub-field is selected within one
frame for maintenance discharge in accordance with this
method, the emission luminance can be controlled by the number
of times of maintenance discharge in the sub-field selected,
and therefore, the display of 64 shades of gray can be
implemented.In this respect, FIG. 12 is a sectional view showing
a general plasma display panel. In FIG. 12, reference
numeral 1 designates a front substrate; 2a, a scanning
electrode; 2b, a maintenance electrode; 3, a bus electrode;
4, a dielectric layer; 5, a rear substrate; 6, a data 
electrode; 7, a white dielectric body; 8, fluorescent
material; and 9, a discharge cell respectively.If the preliminary discharge periods are provided at
the heads of all the sub-fields as described above,
preliminary discharge occurs at least six times even in a
non-display portion to cause light emission over the entire
screen. This
