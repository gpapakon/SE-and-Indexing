<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for confirming delivery of files from a 
hub server to multiple receiving sites in a file broadcast system. 

Confirmation is assured in a file broadcast system, even where receiving 
sites are linked to a hub server via a connectionless network, by 

requiring receiving sites to delay transmission of confirmation by an 
amount of time (34) which is different for each receiving site, 

by having the 
hub server aggregate multiple confirmations into a single 

acknowledgment message (36), and by requiring each receiving site to 
retransmit a confirmation if an acknowledgment message is not received 

from the hub server within a timeout period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to file broadcast systems and,
more particularly, to such a system having an apparatus for confirming delivery of
broadcast files as specified in the preamble of claim 1.File broadcast (FB) is used to transfer files from a centralized computing
platform to one or more distributed platforms, as illustrated in Figure 1A. It can be
considered an application-layer service in the Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI) model. A file broadcast system transfers files from headquarter's computers
11 connected to a hub server 12 to computers 16 at branch offices through either
a direct multidrop connection or a satellite network (VSAT) 14. When using a
VSAT network, a file broadcast system can take advantage of the broadcast
nature of satellite communications to greatly reduce the cost of transferring files
that need to be sent to multiple locations. With such a network, a single broadcast
of a file can be received in parallel by all sites requiring it.The delivery of a file consists of several steps, shown in Figure 1B. First,
the headquarters computing platform 11 submits the file to be transmitted to a
predefined directory on the hub server disk 12. Following the file, an envelope is
transferred describing the file and the servers to receive the file. Second, hub
equipment 13 serves as a conduit for transmissions from hub server 12 and
broadcasts the file across a spacelink 14. This occurs once a file is made available
to the hub server 12 and is required by one or more computing platforms 16. Third,
file broadcast software at the receiving computing platform 16 performs requests
for transmission and retransmission as necessary to receive the file. Local 
equipment 15 receives the transmission from spacelink 14 and serves as a conduit
for further transmission to computing platform 16. Fourth, once the file is
completely received, the file broadcast optionally performs post-processing, places
the file into the addressed directory, and executes a command script if it is
present.In Computer Communications, vol. 14, No. 5, June 1991, Guildford GB,

described, wherein data packets are broadcast to multiple receiving sites. The
delivery of broadcast data packets is confirmed by each receiving site by
transmitting a confirmation. In a multicast situation a backoff scheme is provided

<CLAIMS>
A file broadcast system, wherein files are broadcast simultaneously from a
hub server (12) to multiple receiving sites (16), said system including an apparatus

for confirming delivery of broadcast files comprising a transmitter at each receiving
site (16) which transmits to the hub server (12) a confirmation (35),said hub server

or said receiving site being adapted to delay transmission of a confirmation by a
backoff period (34), such that confirmations (35) from the multiple receiving sites

(16) arrive at said hub server (12) at different times, 
characterized in that
 a
mechanism (22) is provided at the hub server (12) for packing a multiplicity of

confirmations (35) into a single acknowledgement (36), said acknowledgement
containing a list of the receiving site (16) sources of confirmations (35) received, and


in that
 a broadcast transmitter(13) is provided at the hub server for transmitting the
packed acknowledgement to the multiple receiving sites (16), said transmitter at a

receiving site including a mechanism for retransmitting the confirmation (35) of the
receiving site (16) if the receiving site does not receive the acknowledgement from

the hub server within a determined period of time (37) measured at the receiving
site.
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each
receiving site (16) is adapted to determine the backoff period (34) by reference to

first and second factors, the first factor being a timestamp associated with a host
computing machine at the receiving site, and the second factor being an identifier

associated with the receiving site.
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the hub
server (12) is adapted to determine the backoff period (34) which is included within

broadcasts to the receiving sites (16).
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each
receiving site (16) is adapted to determine the backoff period (34) by reference to

first and second factors, the first factor being the bandwidth available for
transmissions from the receiving sites (16) to the hub server (12), and the second

factor being the number of receiving sites (16).
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
mechanism (22) for packing confirmations (35) is adapted to pack a number of

confirmations in an acknowledgement which is determined by first and second 
factors, the first factor being the number of files (32) transmitted and the second

factor being the number of receiving sites (16).
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
mechanism (22) for packing confirmations (35) is adapted to pack a number of

confirmations in an acknowledgement (36) which is determined by the number of
receiving sites (16).
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
determined period of time is a fixed estimate based on the expected return time for

an acknowledgement (36).
A file broadcast system according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 said
mechanism for retransmission is adapted to include a flag with the retransmission to

indicate that it is a retransmission.
A file broadcast system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
hub server (12) is adapted to establish said determined period of time and

broadcast it to the receiving sites (16).
