<ABSTRACT>
A diagnosing apparatus of a yarn monitor which 
continuously detects yarn diameter of each unit of a 

spinning machine comprising a number of spinning units, 
is provided with average value calculating means of 

yarn diameter, yarn evenness calculating means expressing 
average deviation of yarn diameter in ratio to average 

value of yarn diameter, and decision means for comparing 
the average value and the yarn evenness with that of 

other units and for outputting an abnormal signal when 
only the average value is different.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control method and a control apparatus according to the preamble of claims 1, 3 and 6.A pneumatic spinning machine as one of a
spinning machine comprising a number of spinning units,
is disclosed, for example, in Figs. 3 and 4 of US-A-5 119 308,
which represent the closest prior art. This pneumatic spinning machine will be
described based on Figs. 6 and 7. (Reference numerals as shown in US-A-5 119 308) Fig. 7 is a diagram
showing main part in each spinning unit. In Fig. 6,
numeral 24 designates a back roller, numeral 25 designates
a middle roller and numeral 26 designates a front roller,
and an apron 27 being an endless rubber belt is wound
on the middle roller 25. Each of the rollers 24, 25,
26 constituted by a top roller at upper side and a bottom
roller at lower side, and carries out draft of a sliver
S. An air jet nozzle 28 twists the sliver S getting
out of the front roller 26, and a spinning yarn Y is
manufactured. A delivery roller 29 draws a yarn from
the spinning nozzle 28, and a yarn detector 11 of
photoelectric conversion type, i.e., a slub catcher
detects variation of diameter (thickness) of the yarn
Y and outputs a yarn unevenness signal. In addition, 
yarn speed is detected by a sensor 36 installed near
the lower front roller 26a. The yarn speed is controlled
by a master computer (not shown) in a spinning machine
as a whole.Fig. 7 is a detailed diagram of a yarn detector.
In Fig. 7, the yarn detector, i.e., a slub catcher 11
comprises a light emission diode 30 and a photo transistor
31, and light quantity sent from the light emission
diode 30 is detected by the photo transistor 31 and
the detected light quantity is outputted as electric
displacement between terminals. Thus the slub catcher
11 in such system is a detector of high sensitivity
and high responsivity, and if the slub is encountered
and displacement of quite large electric quantity is
detected, a cutting device 32 acts by its output signal
37 and the yarn Y is cut at the position, and the
electric signal 37 from the yarn detector, i.e., the
slub catcher 11 is also utilized as a yarn quality
analyzing signal. In addition, in place of the slub
catcher of optical type, that of static capacity type
may be also used.The yarn detector 11 contains an amplifier
(not shown) so that the gain adjustment and the zero
point adjustment can be carried out. In some case,
however, the zero point may be deviated, or the light
receiving surface of the photo transistor 31 in Fig.
7 may be spoiled or the gain is
