<ABSTRACT>
A video signal recording apparatus includes a first device for 

processing a first time segment of a video signal in response to a 
second time segment of the video signal. The first time segment 

relates to a first frame or field while the second time segment 
relates to a second frame or field which precedes the first frame or 

field. A second device is operative for interrupting the processing 
by the first device when the video signal starts to be subjected to an 

editing process. A third device is operative for recording an editing 
information signal and an output signal of the first device on a 

recording medium. The editing information signal represents a 
time of occurrence of the editing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video signal recording apparatus 
and a video signal reproducing apparatus. This invention also 
relates to a method of recording a video signal. Video signals tend to have a correlation between successive 
frames. In a video signal recording and reproducing apparatus, it is 
conceivable to enhance the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of a 
reproduced video signal by the following signal processing. 
Specifically, in a recording side, an original video signal to be 
recorded is processed by using a correlation between successive 
frames, and the resultant video signal is recorded on a recording 
medium. A reproducing side reads out the video signal from the 
recording medium, and processes the video signal in a manner 
opposite to the manner of the processing in the recording side to 
recover the original video signal. Generally, an editing process causes the replacement of a 
recorded video signal by a new recorded video signal which does 
not have any correlation with the former video signal. Accordingly, 
the editing process makes difficult the enhancement of the S/N 
ratio of a reproduced video signal which uses a correlation between 
successive frames. It is a first object of this invention to provide an improved 
video signal recording apparatus.  It is a second object of this invention to provide an improved 
video signal reproducing apparatus. It is a third object of this invention to provide an improved 
method of recording a video signal. A first aspect of this invention provides a video signal 
recording apparatus comprising first means for processing a first 
time segment of a video signal in response to a second time 
segment of the video signal, the first time segment relating to a first 
frame or field, the second time segment relating to a second frame 
or field which precedes the first frame or field; second means for 
interrupting the processing by the first means when the video signal 
starts to be subjected to an editing process; and third means for 
recording an editing information signal and an output signal of the 
first means on a recording medium, the editing information signal 
representing a time of occurrence of the editing process. A second aspect of this invention provides a video signal 
reproducing apparatus comprising first means for reproducing a 
video signal and an editing information signal from a recording 
medium, the editing information signal representing a time of 
occurrence of an editing process; second means for processing a 
first time
