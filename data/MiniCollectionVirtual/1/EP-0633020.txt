<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a sustained-release preparation which includes 
permitting a water-soluble polypeptide to permeate into a biodegradable 

matrix in the aqueous solution. The production method of the present 
invention makes possible the permeation of a water-soluble polypeptide into a 

biodegradable matrix without bringing the water-soluble polypeptide into 
contact with an organic solvent. Hence the water-soluble polypeptide is 

prepared without affecting the water-soluble polypeptide bioactivity and is 
thus effective for use as a pharmaceutical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sustained-release preparation
comprising a water-soluble polypeptide penetrated in a biodegradable matrix.Proteins, also referred to as polypeptides, are known to exhibit various
pharmacologic actions in vivo. Thanks to advances in genetic engineering
and cell engineering technologies, some have been produced in large amounts
for pharmaceutical application using organisms such as Escherichia coli,
yeasts, animal cells and hamsters. Such protein pharmaceuticals include
interferons (alpha, beta, gamma), interleukin 2, erythropoietin and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). These proteins, however,
since they have generally a short biological half-life, must be administered
frequently, posing the significant physical burden of injection on patients. To
solve this problem, various attempts have been made to develop sustained-release
preparations. Since proteins represented by cytokines must be
administered with great care while monitoring their therapeutic effect, there
is a need for development of injectable sustained-release preparations,
particularly microcapsular sustained-release preparations, that have a
release duration of about 1 to 2 weeks. It is generally known, however, that
proteins undergo denaturation and lose their bioactivity upon exposure to
heat, organic solvents, strong shearing force etc. For example, an aqueous
solution of a protein can rapidly lose its bioactivity when heated at 60°C for 20
minutes. Bioactivity of a protein can decrease upon heating, even at a lower
temperature of 50°C for about 1 hour. Similarly, protein bioactivity is known
to decrease in the presence of an organic solvent such as ethanol or
dichloromethane.WO93/06872 discloses a technology for preparing a pharmaceutical
preparation comprising porous particles of a biodegradable polymer allowing
osteogenic proteins to be released over an extended period of time; an
osteogenic protein and autologous blood aggregate. In this technology, the
active ingredient osteogenic protein is adsorbed to the particles just before
administration, and autologous blood is added to form an aggregate, to control 
release. Sustained-release duration is about several weeks.
This method is not commonly usable because it involves the use
of autologous blood.In the Journal of Controlled Release, Vol. 23, p. 157
(1993), A. Supersaxo et al. describe a technology in which a
porous microsphere is prepared using a biodegradable polymer,
after which a macromolecule is permitted to permeate therein and
