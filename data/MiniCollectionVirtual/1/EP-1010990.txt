<ABSTRACT>
The metal detector access gate uses a cooperating magnetic field transmitter and receiver, for detecting metal objects by a variation in the magnetic field, with the magnetic field transmitter and/or receiver provided as a self-supporting metal structure (2,4,6,8) assembled from metal tubes (2), mechanically coupled together via conductive coupling elements (4) with reception bores (8) receiving end fittings (6) at the ends of the metal tubes. At least one annular core is fitted to the self-supporting metal structure.
