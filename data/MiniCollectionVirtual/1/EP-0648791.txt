<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
novel polymers, intermediate compounds and polyurethane 
products made therefrom. More particularly, this invention 
aims at providing a process for producing a novel compound, 
which may effectively be used to produce polyurethane products 
as and when needed and in predetermined form and 
characteristics. Usually, polyurethane compounds are in foam form, and the 
expression "polyurethane form" used in the art signifies a 
product having a significant number of urethane groups, which 
have the repeating structure : 
   Polyurethane products, e.g. foams, are ordinarily prepared 
by reacting an isocyanate compound with a compound having one 
or more "active hydrogens". Such active hydrogen compounds 
include polyhydroxy compounds, generally termed "polyols", and 
compounds containing amino or carboxyl moieties. These 
compounds may additionally contain functional groups capable of 
supplying replaceable hydrogens. For instance, hydroxyl 
terminated  
 
polyethers and polyesters have been widely used to prepare 
polyurethane foams. Hydroxy-fatty oils such as castor oil or 
derivatives thereof have also been used as compounds 
containing active hydrogen, particularly when rigid or semi-rigid 
products are needed. Catalysts are preferably included in the reaction mixture 
to produce the intermediate component which may subsequently be 
reacted with ease and rapidity with isocyanate compounds. 
However, it has been found that the addition of catalyst is not 
required in all applications. Gas for producing the foam is usually generated at least 
in part by adding water to the reactants. The water reacts 
with isocyanate to produce carbon dioxide for foaming. In 
addition thereto, blowing agents can be mixed with the 
reactants to produce gas for foaming. Surfactants and other 
additives may also be included in the reaction mixture to 
regulate the size of the foam cells and otherwise to influence 
the properties of the resulting foam. As regards the polyurethane products obtained by 
interacting the intermediate compound with the isocyanate 
derivative, it is possible to obtain a wide range of physical 
and chemical properties of the foam by appropriate selection of 
the specific raw materials and the reaction conditions.  The foaming agent does play a very crucial role and hence 
its reliability has to be ascertained carefully in controlling 
the foam processing. Hitherto, halohydrocarbons such as 
fluorocarbons (FreonS (trademark) /CFCs) have been
