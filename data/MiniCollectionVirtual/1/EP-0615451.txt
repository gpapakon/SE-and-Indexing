<DESCRIPTION>
Hodgkin's Disease is a human lymphoma, the etiology of which is still not well
understood. The neoplastic cells of Hodgkin's Disease are known as Hodgkin and
Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells. CD30 is a 120 kd surface antigen widely used as a
clinical marker for Hodgkin's lymphoma and related hematologic malignancies (Froese
et al., J. Immunol. 139:2081 (1987); Pfreundschuh et al., Onkologie 12:30 (1989);
Carde et al., Eur. J. Cancer 26:474 (1990)). Originally identified by the monoclonal
antibody Ki-1, which is reactive with H-RS cells (Schwab et al., Nature (London)
299:65 (1982)), CD30 was subsequently shown to be expressed on a subset of non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas (NHL), including Burkitt's lymphoma, as well as several
virally-transformed lines (human T Cell Lymphotrophic Virus I or II transformed T
cells, and Epstein-Barr Virus transformed B cells (Stein et al., Blood 66:848 (1985);
Andreeson et al., Blood 63:1299 (1984)). Indeed, overall, 50% of Hodgkin's
lymphomas are EBV+ (Klein, Blood 80:299 (1992)). That CD30 plays a role in
normal lymphoid interactions is suggested by its histological detection on a small
population of lymphoid cells in reactive lymph nodes, and by induced expression on
purified T and B cells following lectin activation (Stein et al., Int. J. Cancer 30:445
(1982) and Stein et al., 1985, supra).Cloning and expression of a gene encoding CD30 has been reported and CD30
has been characterized as a transmembrane protein that possesses substantial homology
to the nerve growth factor receptor superfamily (Durkop et al., Cell 68:421, 1992).
Durkop et al. suggest that CD30 is the receptor for one or more as yet unidentified
growth factors, and recognize the importance of investigating the existence and nature
of such growth factors in order to achieve insight into the etiology of Hodgkin's
Disease.Prior to the present invention, however, no such growth factors or other
molecules that bind to the CD30 receptor were known. A need thus remained for
identification and characterization of a ligand for CD30. The present invention provides a novel cytokine designated CD30-L, as well as
isolated DNA encoding CD30-L protein, expression vectors comprising the isolated
DNA, and a method for producing CD30-L by cultivating host cells containing the
expression vectors under conditions appropriate for expression of the CD30-L protein.
CD30-L is a ligand that binds to the Hodgkin's disease-associated antigen CD30 (a cell
surface receptor). Antibodies directed against the CD30-L protein or an immunogenic
fragm
