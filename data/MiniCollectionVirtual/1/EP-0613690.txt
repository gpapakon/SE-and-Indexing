<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous compositions 
containing the contrast agent iodoaniline derivatives and 
methods for their use in diagnostic radiology of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Roentgenographic examination utilizing X-rays and 
computed tomography (hereinafter CT) scans of fractures and 
other conditions associated with the skeletal system is 
routinely practised without the use of contrast agents. X-ray 
visualization of organs containing soft tissue, such as the 
gastrointestinal (hereinafter GI) tract, requires the use of 
contrast agents which attenuate X-ray radiation. D. P. Swanson 
et al in "Pharmaceuticals In Medical Imaging", 1990, 
MacMillan Publishing Company, provides an excellent 
background in medical imaging utilizing contrast agents and 
compositions therewith. Roentgenographic examination of the GI tract are 
indicated for conditions of digestive disorders, changes in 
bowel habit, abdominal pain, GI bleeding and the like. Prior to 
radiological examination, administration of a radiopaque 
contrast medium is necessary to permit adequate delineation 
of the respective lumen or mucosal surface from surrounding 
soft tissues. Accordingly, a contrast medium is administered 
orally to visualize the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, 
duodenum and proximal small intestine. The contrast medium 
is administered rectally for examination of the distal small 
intestine and the colon. The most widely used contrast agent for the 
visualization of the GI tract is barium sulfate administered as a 
suspension orally or rectally as an enema. (See, for example, 
U.S. Patent Nos.: 2,659,690; 2,680,089; 3,216,900; 3,235,462; 
4,038,379 and 4,120,946) Notwithstanding its relatively good 
contrast characteristics, negligible absorption from the GI tract  
 
following oral or rectal administration and speedy excretion 
from the body, barium sulfate has certain disadvantages. In 
the presence of intestinal fluids it lacks homogeneity and 
poorly adheres to mucus membranes which can result in poor 
X-ray images. In the colon, when administered as an enema, it 
flocculates and forms irregular clumps with fecal matter. Iodinated organic compounds have also been used as GI 
contrast agents since the iodine atom is an effective X-ray 
absorber. They have the most versatility and are utilized in 
the widest variety of procedures. They are very absorptive of 
X-rays with which the iodine interacts and produce a so-called 
photoelectric effect which is a large magnification in contrast 
caused by the photons
