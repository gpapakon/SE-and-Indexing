<ABSTRACT>
Method of gluing wood-based products by means of amino-resin-based adhesives. In the method, the amino resin is cured with a hardener composition containing alkylamine salts selected from a group consisting of the following compounds: NH2((CH2)nNH)mH x lX wherein n = 2 - 5, m = 1 - 3, l = 1 - 4, and X is an organic or inorganic acid; in formula (I) R = H or CH2CH2NH2 and X an acid as above and l = 1 - 3; and CH2CH2(NHCH2CH2CH2NH2)2 x lX wherein l = 1 - 4 and X has the same meaning as above. The invention also relates to a hardener composition for the amino resin, which composition contains alkylamine salts as stated above. Preferred alkylamine salts are ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and ethylenediamine disulfamic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of gluing 
wood-based products by means of amino-resin-based adhesives. 
More specifically, the invention relates to a gluing method in 
which certain alkylamine salts are used as hardener for the 
amino resin. The invention also comprises a hardener composition 
for amino resins. Amino resins constitute precondensates of amine-containing 
compounds and formaldehyde. There most important use is as 
binders for cellulose-based products. Acids or acid containing 
substances are normally used as hardeners for these resins, 
which hardeners when admixed to the resin lead to final 
curing. When gluing wood, it is known to mix a liquid resin 
component with a powder or liquid hardener composition and 
subsequently apply the thus obtained adhesive mixture to one 
or both joint faces and, after joining thereof, press the glue 
line either at room temperature or at an increased temperature, 
the temperature in the glue line normally reaches to 
about 80-110°C. Since in this procedure the resin and the 
hardener are mixed in advance, use is made of hardener 
compositions which allow a pot life for the adhesive mixture. 
By pot life is meant the time during which the adhesive 
mixture is of such low viscosity that it can be applied. It is 
well known that working with curing adhesive systems frequently 
causes problems with precuring during the application of 
the adhesive before pressure is applied. This is particularly 
evident in fast adhesive systems. Precuring also causes 
problems in the mixing and application equipment, especially 
during breakdowns, thus necessitating frequent cleaning of the 
equipment. Therefore it is an advantage if the pot life is as 
long as possible. However, it is also necessary to have short 
press times in order to obtain a rate of production which is 
as high as possible. Short press times, however, require 
adhesives with fast curing. A further essential parameter of 
the adhesive systems is the press temperature. In adhesive 
formulations were glue and hardener are mixed, one strives to 
achieve optimal balance of a long pot life against fast curing 
at low press temperatures. However, it has proved to be  
 
difficult to accomplish this using the hardeners that are 
available on the market. The known hardeners which have a long 
pot life require in many cases a relatively high temperature 
to yield an acceptably short press time. On the other hand, 
hardeners which allow fast curing at lower temperatures often 
have a relatively short
