<ABSTRACT>
Electronic interconnection of two printed wiring structures. Two printed wiring 
boards (11, 16) or a flexprint circuit (20) and a printed wiring board (11) are 

interconnected by creating a plated hole pattern (12) on a surface (12) of the printed 
wiring board (11), and wherein holes (13) of the pattern (12) have a concave cross 

section. The holes (13) of the plated hole pattern (12) are mated with corresponding 
bumps (17) or dimples (17) disposed on the second printed wiring board (16) or the 

flexprint circuit (20). The holes (13) formed in the first printed wiring board (11) are 
disposed a predetermined depth below a surface (18) of the printed wiring board (11), 

typically to a depth of between 0.007 inches and 0.020 inches below the surface. The 
plurality of plated holes (13) are formed by electroless plating or electroplating of the 

holes (13). The present interconnection structure (10) provides for reliable and self 
aligning interconnection of the two printed wiring boards (11, 16) or the flexprint 

circuit (20) and printed wiring board (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention. The present invention relates to electronic packaging, 
and more particularly, to a cavity and bump interconnection structure for use in 
electronic packaging. 2. Description of Related Art. The interconnection of the electronic 
components, especially high density electronic components and printed wiring boards, 
presents recurring problems for which many conventional solutions exist. Prior art 
interconnections techniques that have been used to interconnect two printed wiring 
boards or a flexprint and a printed wiring hoard include soldering connectors to both 
subassemblies and then subsequently mating the connectors. The use of connectors 
results in bulky, heavy, relatively expensive, and in many cases, an impractical 
solution. For example, conventional micro-connectors, because of their small size, 
require soldering or other expensive wiring techniques. Most micro-connectors cannot 
handle a 3 mil to 5 mil (0.0762 mm to 0.1270 mm) or smaller line width and spacing in 
an efficient manner. Many conventional interconnection systems utilize pads or electrically 
conductive dots, such as the well-known gold-dot interconnection structure, as a means 
of providing the interconnection, such as is disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 
4,125,310 and 4,453,795. These patents describe a plurality of generally resilient 
metallic raised projections. In the latter patent, a resilient backup mechanism is used to 
avoid overstressing and squashing of the resilient projections or contacts beyond their 
elastic limit, which overstressing precludes repeated mating and unmating of connectors  
 
incorporating such projections. While these terminations otherwise effectively and 
reliably interconnect mating circuits, their manufacture can be difficult, time consuming 
and costly. Furthermore, the manufacturing process for forming such bumps is limited 
to a size of about 2 mil (0.0508 mm) in diameter. These bumps also require proper 
support, without exposing them to delamination due to outgassing from support 
materials during or after production or to inattention to thermal matching with its 
surrounding materials, or to possible electrical or chemical interaction with the 
surrounding materials. Another interconnection technique is described in copending U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/989,612, filed December 14, 1992, assigned to the assignee 
of the present invention. This invention comprises an electrical connector for a flat 
cable or circuit having contacts or
