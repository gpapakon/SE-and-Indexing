<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 3-amino-5-methylpyrazole,
characterized in that an alkali metal cyanoacetone is

reacted with a hydrazinium salt of a mineral acid.
A process according to claim 1 characterized in
that the reaction proceeds in a solvent or a suspension

medium.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that water, organic solvents or mixtures thereof are used

as solvent or suspension medium.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that water formed or added is removed

during and/or after the reaction.
A process according to at least one of claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the reaction is carried out

in the temperature range of from 10 to 200°C, preferably
from 20 to 60°C, at atmospheric pressure.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the alkali metal salts of the acid

radical introduced by the hydrazinium salt which are
formed during the reaction are crystallized, after

separating off the water formed or additionally introduced,
by addition of a low molecular weight alcohol o
r
ketone and are separated off by filtration.
