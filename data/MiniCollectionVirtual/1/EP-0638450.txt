<ABSTRACT>
The pivotal bearing support made of plastic has a base body (1), a rear bearing dome and a through-hole for a sun-visor spindle (3). In order to mount the pivotal bearing support on a vehicle-body sheet (12) without the use of screws, there are integrally formed on the rear side of the base body (1) two mounting elements (5) which are each integrally formed at a distance from the bearing dome and have a web (6) and hooks (7) running in opposite directions. The hooks (7) can be inserted through openings (15) in the vehicle body and are capable of reaching behind the vehicle-body wall by rotation of the base body (1). To lock the mounting elements (5) in position, pegs (9) can additionally be introduced into the openings (15) in the vehicle body and can be locked in place by means of the webs (6).
