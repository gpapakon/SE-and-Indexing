<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of producing and purifying combustible gases from flue gases (2) generated by a pyrolysis plant or melt-down reactor. The flue gases (2) are passed over a coke bed (1), the coke feed to the coke bed (1) being preheated to temperatures of 
>
600  DEG C with a heated inert gas. This makes it possible to utilize directly the heat in the flue gases produced by pyrolysis plants or melt-down processes and to produce a particularly high value gas value by conversion in a thermal reactor.

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing and purifying combustible gases 
from offgases of a pyrolytic plant or a meltdown reactor, 

wherein the offgas is conducted through a coke bed (18), 
characterized in that the coke (18) supplied to the coke bed 

is preheated to temperatures of above 600°C by aid of a heated 
inert gas. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
heated coke (18) is adjusted to a reduced slag melting 

temperature by adding lime and optionally further additives 
(19). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
preheating of said coke (18) is effected by inert gas 

conducted in circulation, said inert gas being heated to 
temperatures of above 650°C, in particular 730°C, in a heat 

exchanger by the hot export gas leaving the coke bed reactor. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the CO-content of the recirculated inert gas is monitored 

and inert gas, in particular N
2
, is added upon exceeding a 
limit value. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that lime is added to said coke in an amount 

sufficient for the desulphurization of the export gas. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the export gas is conducted through a 

hot gas cyclone (6) and the separated dust is recycled into 
the reactor (1). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the dust discharged from the coke 

preheating shaft (15) is separated, and recycled into the coke  
 

bed reactor (1), by at least 50 % by weight, preferably 
approximately 70 % by weight.
