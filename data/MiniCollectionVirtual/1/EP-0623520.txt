<ABSTRACT>
A sealed vessel formed by a cover (2), a bottom (8) and a 
lateral surface. 
The cover (2) and the bottom (8) are obtained by 
thermoforming of a solid sheet of plastic material 

identical to that from which the lateral surface is formed. 
The lateral surface is obtained by means of dinking, 

starting from a sheet of plastic material having an 
alveolar structure, or from a solid sheet. 
The cover (2) is engaged at the upper end of the vessel, 
and the bottom (8) is welded or glued to its lower end. 

Furthermore, the lateral surface is obtained by welding 
(melting) or by fixing in a known manner (for example by an 

adhesive) the two opposite ends of the planar development 
of the lateral surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention realtes to a sealed plastic vessel 
for collecting materials to be isolated from the external 
environment, as for example hospital waste. Vessels having this function are already known. A first type of vessel is made of cardboard. Even if it is light, since the required sealing conditions 
are not provided, it is often advised against its use. Other vessels, on the other hand, are made of plastics, but 
even if they are adequate to ensure the required seal, they 
employ a noticeable amount of materials which makes them 
heavy to transport, and when they are to be incinerated, 
they excessively increase during combustion the temperature 
of the furnace, thus causing problems as regards the 
operation of the plant. The present invention provides a vessel or container which 
is sealed, which may be recycled due to the fact that all 
its parts are made of the same material, and for whose 
production the use of raw material is reduced, without 
lowering the required resistance of the vessel. The present invention will now be described according to a 
particular embodiment thereof, which is given only for 
illustrative but non-limitative purposes. In the drawings: 
Fig. 1 schematically shows a longitudinal section of the 
upper part of the vessel and its associated cover before 
the latter is fixed at the upper end of the lateral walls;  Fig. 2, is a perspective view of the cover of the vessel, 
with one of its four U-shaped edges cut away; Fig. 3, shows a small lace or string made of nylon or a 
similar material, used to close a bag to be enclosed in the 
vessel, the bag containing the material to be isolated; Fig. 4a shows the longitudinal section of the lower part of 
the vessel, the bottom thereof being welded to the lateral 
walls; Fig. 4b, is a perspective view of the lower part of the 
vessel, the bottom thereof being welded to the lateral 
walls; Fig. 5, shows the development of the lateral wall of the 
container, shaped like a frustum of pyramid; Fig. 6, is a plan view of the bottom of the vessel. It follows from Fig. 1, that the vessel has slanting 
lateral walls 1, which form a lateral surface shaped like a 
frustum of pyramid with upper and lower (open) ends having 
a rectangular or square cross sectional area. On the upper end of the lateral surface shaped like a 
frustum of pyramid (having a larger cross sectional area 
than the lower end), there is assembled a cover 2, in a 
manner described later. The lateral surface, shaped like a  
 
frustum of pyramid, is obtained by

<CLAIMS>
A sealed plastic vessel for collecting material to be 
isolated from the external environment, characterized in 

that it comprises a lateral surface, a cover (2) and a 
bottom (8), all made of the same plastic material, the 

lateral surface being obtained by dinking, from a sheet 
having an alveolar structure or from a solid sheet, said 

cover (2) and said bottom (8) being obtained by 
thermoforming of a solid sheet, the bottom (8) being 

welded by melting the plastics or being fixed in any 
known manner so as to realize a seal, to the lower e
nd 
of the lateral surface, the lateral surface being welded 

or fixed in any known manner, at the two ends of its 
planar development, said cover (2) being engaged at the 

upper end of the vessel, providing a seal. 
A vessel according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said cover (2) has U-shaped edges with projections or 

impressions (14), so as to ensure an irreversible 
closing. 
A vessel according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
lateral walls (1) of the vessel, which form its lateral 

surface, have tongues (9a, 9b, 9c, 9d) which are folded 
towards the outside of the vessel, said tongues being 

engaged together with the upper edges of said lateral 
walls inside the grooves defined by said U-shaped edges 

 
(11), in which a sealing substance is introduced, so 

that said projections or impressions (14) will hook from 
below said tongues (9a, 9b, 9c, 9d). 
A vessel according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said cover (2) has reinforcements or ribs (12a, 12b) 

which form grooves on one side of the cover (2), and 
projections on the other side, the thickness of the 

cover remaining constant. 
A vessel according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
bottom (8) of the vessel has U-shaped edges (15) in 

whose grooves there are inserted the lower edges of the 
lateral walls (1) of the vessel, said lower edges being 

welded or fixed in a known manner, to said U-shaped 
edges (15) of the bottom (8). 
A vessel according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said bottom (8) has reinforcements (16) which form 

grooves on one side of the bottom (8), and projections 
on the other side. 
A vessel according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that all its components are made of 

polypropylene. 
A vessel according to any of the claims 1 to 4, or claim 
6 or 7, characterized in that said bottom (8) forms a 

 
base and four lateral surfaces which are welded or glued 

externally or internally to the lower edges of the 
lateral surfaces (1). 
A vessel according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that on two opposite lateral walls (1), 

there are glued or welded by melting or ultrasound, two 
handles previously sheared from a solid sheet of the 

same material as all the other components of the vessel. 
A vessel according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that on the cover (2) there is provided 

a seat (19) for a small lace or string (20) preferably 
made of nylon.
