<ABSTRACT>
A process for alkylating an olefin with an isoparaffin comprising contacting an olefin-containing feed with an isoparaffin-containing feed in the presence of crystalline microporous materials such as MCM-22, MCM-36, and MCM-49, under alkylating conditions, including temperatures at least equal to the critical temperature of the principal components, primarily isoparaffin, and at pressures at least equal to the critical pressure of the principal component of the feed, primarily the isoparaffin. Specific examples include the alkylation of an isobutane-n-butene feed mixture under the supercritical conditions of the principal component of the feed, namely isobutane, as isobutane is used in large excess to promote the selective formation of the alkylate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of
alkylating an isoparaffin.Alkylation is a reaction in which an alkyl group
is added to an organic molecule. Thus an isoparaffin
can be reacted with an olefin to provide an
isoparaffin of higher molecular weight.
Industrially, the concept depends on the reaction of
a C2 to C5 olefin with isobutane in the presence of
an acidic catalyst producing a so-called alkylate.
This alkylate is a valuable blending component in the
manufacture of gasolines due not only to its high
octane rating but also to its sensitivity to octane-enhancing
additives. Industrial alkylation processes
have historically used hydrofluoric or sulfuric acid
catalysts under relatively low temperature
conditions. The sulfuric acid alkylation reaction is
particularly sensitive to temperature, with low
temperatures being favored to minimize the side
reaction of olefin polymerization. Acid strength in
these liquid acid catalyzed alkylation processes is
preferably maintained at 88 to 94 weight percent by
the continuous addition of fresh acid and the
continuous withdrawal of spent acid. The
hydrofluoric acid process is less temperature
sensitive and the acid is easily recovered and
purified.Both sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid
alkylation share inherent drawbacks including
environmental and safety concerns, acid consumption,
and sludge disposal. Research efforts have been
directed to developing alkylation catalysts which are
equally as effective as sulfuric or hydrofluoric
acids but which avoid many of the problems associated
with these two acids. For a general discussion of
sulfuric acid alkylation, see the series of three 
articles by L F Albright et al "Alkylation of Isobutene with C4 Olefins, Ind. Eng. Chem.
Res., 381-397, (1988). For a survey of hydrofluoric acid catalyzed alkylation, see
Handbook of Petroleum Refining Processes 23-28 (R A Meyers, ed., 1986).With increasing demands for octane and increasing environmental concerns,
it has been desirable to develop an alkylation process employing safer, more
environmentally acceptable catalyst systems. Specifically, it is desirable to provide an
industrially viable alternative to the currently used hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid
alkylation processes. Consequently, substantial efforts have been made to develop a
viable isoparaffin-olefin alkylation process which avoids the environmental and safety
problems associated with sulfuric and hydrofluoric acid alkylation while retaining the
alkylate quality and reliability characteristic of these
