<ABSTRACT>
Polystyrene melts to which flameproofing agents and nucleating agents have been added are foamed by the addition of alkanes such as propane, butane or propane/butane mixtures, as blowing agents in such a way that the flameproofing of the polystyrene foams is achieved after a very short storage time or at the latest after storage for three weeks at room temperature. Even after a storage time of one week, sufficient blowing agent is still present in the closed-cell pores of the polystyrene foams to enable adequate post-expansion of the foams with an expansion factor of from 1.8 to 2.0.

<CLAIMS>
A process for foaming polystyrene which has been
given a flame retardant treatment by addition of a

blowing agent, such as proprane or butane, which
comprises mixing into the polystyrene melt mixtures

of propane and butane containing 60 to 90% by volume
of propane and 40 to 10% by volume of n-butane

and/or iso-butane, where the content of blowing
agent comprises up to 3% by weight of the total

weight of the polystyrene.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
poly
styrene melt is melted from a polystyrene
copolymer, a copolymer of styrene and butadiene or

a polymer of styrene or mixtures thereof.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
polystyrene melt is melted from a styrene/maleic

acid/anhydride copolymer, acrylic/butadiene/styrene
and mixtures thereof and polyphenylene oxide is

mixed in.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
polystyrene melt is melted from polystyrene granules,

a flameproofing agent and a nucleating agent
in a first extrusion step, the blowing agent is

injected into the polystyrene melt under a high
pressure of up to 350 bar at the end of the first

extrusion step and is mixed homogeneously with this,
and, before a second extrusion step, the polystyrene 

melt is homogenized further and cooled to a melt
temperature of below 150Â°C before the extrusion.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein chalk
and/or talc, depending on the blowing agent composition,

are/is added as the nucleating agent.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein citric
acid and sodium carbonate are added as the

endothermal nucleating agent.
The process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the talc
content in the talc/chalk mixture is reduced as the

propane content in the blowing agent increases.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein a
halogenated alkyl-aryl phosphate, an ammonium polyphosphate,

hexabromocyclododecane or magnesium
hydroxide is added as the flameproofing agent.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
foaming of the polystyrene melt is carried out on

emergence from the extrusion die and outside the
extrusion die in the second extrusion step, and the

cells of the polystyrene foam are filled with blowing
agent immediately after the foaming.
A polystyrene shaped article of extruded polystyrene
foam which contains a blowing agent gas and

a flameproofing agent, wherein the polystyrene
shaped article has a thickness of 1 to 10 mm, a

width of 50 to 320 cm, a foam density of 30 to
70 g/l and a blowing agent content of up to 3.0% by

weight, the blowing agent gas comprising a mixture
of propane and butane containing 60 to 90% by volume

of propane and 40 to 10% by volume of n-butane
and/or iso-butane.
A polystyrene shaped article as claimed in claim 10, 
which comprises sheet goods having a thickness of 2

to 10 mm, a width of 50 to 200 cm, a foam density of
30 to 40 g/l and a blowing agent content after a

storage period of 3 weeks of up to 1.9% by weight.
A polystyrene shaped article as claimed in claim 10,
which is normally flammable to flame retardant

according to building material classes B2 and B1 in
accordance with DIN 4102 after a storage time of 1

to 13 weeks.
A polystyrene shaped article as claimed in claims 10
to 12, wherein the thickness increases by a factor

of 1.8 to 2.0 by subsequent heat treatment within
one week after the extrusion.
