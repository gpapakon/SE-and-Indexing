<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibrating gyroscope
and, more particularly, to a vibrating gyroscope that is
applied to a navigation system which detects a position of a
mobile by detecting its rotational angular velocity and
guides it properly, a system for damping a vibration such a
device for protecting an unsteady hold which detects an
external vibration and damps it properly, or the like.Fig. 19 is a circuit diagram showing a prior art of a
vibrating gyroscope. The vibrating gyroscope 1 includes a
piezoelectric vibrator 2.The piezoelectric vibrator 2 includes a regular
triangular prism-shaped vibrating body 3, three
piezoelectric elements 4a, 4b and 4c are formed on centers
of three side faces of the vibrating body 3, respectively.
In the piezoelectric vibrator 2, when similar driving
signals are applied to, for example, the two piezoelectric
elements 4a and 4b, the vibrating body 3 bends and vibrates
in a direction perpendicular to a main surface of the
piezoelectric element 4c. In this state, similar detecting 
signals are obtained from the piezoelectric elements 4a and
4b. Then, in this state, when a rotational angular velocity
is applied to the piezoelectric vibrator 2 about an axis of
the vibrating body 3, the bending and vibrating direction of
the vibrating body 3 is changed by a Coriolis force,
detecting signals responsive to the rotational angular
velocity are obtained from the two piezoelectric elements 4a
and 4b. In this case, for example, a voltage of one
detecting signal from the piezoelectric element 4a becomes
larger and a voltage of the other detecting signal from the
piezoelectric element 4b becomes smaller responsive to the
rotational angular velocity.Thus, the piezoelectric element 4c of the piezoelectric
vibrator 2 is connected to an input terminal of an
oscillation circuit 5 consisting of, for example, an
amplifier. An output terminal of the oscillation circuit 5
is connected to ends of two resistors 6a and 6b, the other
ends of the resistors 6a and 6b are connected to the two
piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b, respectively. The
piezoelectric elements 4a and 4b are connected to a non-inverting
input terminal and an inverting input terminal of
a differential amplifier circuit 7, respectively.Accordingly, in the vibrating gyroscope 1, by an output
signal from the differential amplifier circuit 7, it can be
detected that any rotational angular velocity is not 
applied, or an applied rotational angular velocity can be
detected.However, in the vibrating gyroscope 1, since the
resist
