<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a direct electrostatic printing method, in which a stream of computer generated signals, defining an image information, are converted to a pattern of electrostatic fields which selectively permit or restrict the transport of charged toner particles from a particle source toward a back electrode and control the deposition of those charged toner particles in an image configuration onto an image receiving medium. Particularly, the present invention refers to a direct electrostatic printing method performed in consecutive print cycles, each of which includes at least one development period (tb) and at least one recovering period (tw) subsequent to each development period (tb), wherein the pattern of electrostatic fields is produced during at least a part of each development period (tb) to selectively permit or restrict the transport of charged toner particles from a particle source toward a back electrode, and wherein a supplemental voltage source is applied at the beginning of each development period to enhance the transport of the particle source at the beginning of each development period. Advantageously, an additional electric field is produced during at least a part of each recovering period (tw) to repel a part of the transported charged toner particles back toward the particle source. Preferably, the supplemental voltage source is supplied to a guard electrode so as to control the amount of toner attracted from the particle source by each aperture. By controlling the amount of toner attracted by each aperture, the boner may be distributed equally among the apertures thereby preventing toner starvation.

 DIRECT PRINTING METHOD WITH IMPROVED CONTROL FUNCTIONBackground of the InventionField of the Invention The present invention relates to a direct electrostatic printing method, in which a stream of computer generated signals, defining an image information, are converted to a pattern of electrostatic fields on control electrodes arranged on a printhead structure, to selectively permit or restrict the passage of toner particles through the printhead structure and control the deposition of those toner particles in an image configuration onto an image receiving medium.Description of the Related ArtOf the various electrostatic printing techniques, the most familiar and widely utilized is that of xerography wherein latent electrostatic images formed on a charged retentive surface are developed by a suitable toner material to render the images visible, the images being subsequently transferred to plain paper.Another form of electrostatic printing is one that has come to be known as direct electrostatic printing (DEP). This form of printing differs from the above mentioned xerographic form, in that toner is deposited in image configuration directly onto plain paper. The novel feature of DEP printing is to allow simultaneous field imaging and toner transport to produce a visible image on paper directly from computer generated signals, without the need for those signals to be intermediately converted to another form of energy such as light energy, as it is required in electrophotographic printing. A DEP printing device has been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,689,935, issued September 5, 1972 to Pressman, et al. Pressman, et al., disclose a multilayered particle flow modulator comprising a continuous layer of conductive material, a segmented layer of conductive material and a layer of insulating material interposed therebetween. An overall applied field projects toner particles 

through apertures arranged in the modulator whereby the particle stream density is modulated by an internal field applied within each aperture.A new concept of direct electrostatic printing was introduced in U.S. Patent No. 5,036,341, granted to Larson, which is incorporated by reference herein. According to Larson, a uniform electric field is produced between a back electrode and a developer sleeve coated with charged toner particles. A printhead structure, such as a control electrode matrix, is interposed in the electric field and utilized to produce a pattern of electrostatic fields which, due to control in accordance with an image
