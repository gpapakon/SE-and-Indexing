<ABSTRACT>
In a stocking belts conveyor (1) an improvement is 
provided for avoiding the belts (25, 26) from sagging 

when the loading sections (25a, 25b) of their paths (P1, 
P2) are lengthened in order to vary the operating 

configuration of the conveyor (1). More particularly, 
the improvement consists of a flexible element (50) which 

comprises a pair of parallel chains (57) which support 
between them a plurality of rotatable rods (58); the 

flexible element (50) is guided along a path (P3) defined 
by a series of drive rollers (60, 60a, 60b) and extends 

between two ends (50a, 50b) fixed to an upper trolley 
(15) of the conveyor (1) so as to be able to support the 

said loading sections (25a, 25b) in the various operating 
configurations thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a belt 
conveyor intended in particular, but not exclusively, for 
the transport of food products in general. In the field of the production of food products, and in 
particular in the field of baked products such as toast 
slices, biscuits and the like, the use of stocking 
conveyors is known; these offer the advantage that their 
length is variable at the section of the belts where the 
products are loaded. In practice, this allows the 
surface on which the toast, biscuits, etc. are loaded to 
be varied, thus adapting the operation of the entire 
conveyor to varying conditions of production; in 
particular, the operational flexibility of a conveyor 
thus conceived allows the time that the products remain 
on it to be increased, thereby providing a useful 
stocking space for them along the production line. In one embodiment, a stocking belt conveyor of the type 
referred to above comprises essentially a pair of 
trolleys, an upper and a lower one respectively, which 
run parallel to each other along corresponding guides 
mounted on a support structure; the respective ends of 
two conveyor belts are mounted on these trolleys with 
their paths determined by a series of support and drive 
rollers also mounted on the structure.  By moving the trolleys along their guides, one is able to 
vary the lengths of the sections of the belts onto which 
the products to be conveyed are loaded. However, a recognised problem which limits the operation 
of conveyors of the type just described is that the 
loading section of each belt sags when its length is 
increased as a result of the movement of the trolleys; it 
is evident that, as a result of this lengthening, the 
loading sections of the belts are more exposed to 
deformation due to the weight of the products. However, 
as the operating configuration of the conveyor is 
variable, it is somewhat difficult to overcome this 
problem in a way which is efficient and adaptable to 
different circumstances. In particular, the present invention relates to an 
improvement in a stocking belt conveyor of the type 
including a support structure, an upper trolley and a 
lower trolley sliding on corresponding guides mounted on 
the structure at respective heights, two flexible belts, 
each guided for movement along a respective path which 
extends between the trolleys and which includes a loading 
section for the products to be conveyed, this section 
extending longitudinally from the upper trolley so as to 
be variable between a

A stocking belt conveyor (1) of the type including 
a support structure (2), an upper trolley (15) and a 

lower trolley (16) sliding on respective guides (10, 11) 
mounted on the support structure (2) at respective 

heights, two flexible belts (25, 26) each guided for 
movement along a respective path (P1, P2) which extends 

between the trolleys (15, 16) and which includes a 
loading section (25a, 26b) for the products to be 

conveyed, this section (25a, 26b) extending 
longitudinally from the upper trolley (15) so as to be 

variable in length between a maximum and a minimum, both 
determined by the position of the trolleys (15, 16) along 

the guides (10, 11), characterised in that it further 
includes a flexible element (50) extending between two 

ends (50a, 50b) fixed to the upper trolley (15) and 
comprising a pair of flexible chains (57) which rotatably 

support a plurality of rods (58) which extend 
transversely the flexible element (50) and are spaced 

along portions thereof starting from the ends (50a, 50b) 
and extending longitudinally for a length substantially 

equal to the maximum length of a corresponding loading 
section (25a, 26b), the flexible element (50) being 

guided for movement along a path (P3) having two 
longitudinal sections (61a, 62b) extending under the 

loading sections (25a, 26b) and along which the flexible 
element (50) is in contact with the belts (25 and 26) 

 
which rest on the rods (58).
