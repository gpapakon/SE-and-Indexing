Hovercraft with at least one compressor mechanism to generate 
an air-cushion, in which the air-cushion is laterally 

limited by a peripheral elastic skirt (2) consisting of a 
back skirt (3) and a finger skirt (4), the lateral areas 

of which are parallel to each another and are each divided 
into two sections (6; 7; 8; 9) which can be shifted independently 

of one another and which are shiftable via tension 
cables (15; 16) which act at skirt segments (5) of 

the finger skirt (4), and in which as a static trimmer the 
centre of buoyancy of the air-cushion is displaced in relation 

to the centre of gravity by grouped, lateral adjustment 
of the finger skirt (4), 
characterised in that
 
each independently shiftable 

section (6; 7; 8; 9) is provided with two tension cables 
(15, 16) which, arranged at a distance from each other and 

guided via deflection rollers (17, 18), each act on one 
skirt segment (5) of the finger skirt (4) and that each 

tension cable (15, 16) is divided within the skirt segment 
(5) into two partial tension cables (20, 21), of which one 

partial tension cable (20) acts on the base of the skirt 
segment (5) and the other partial tension cable (21) acts 

on the connection between the back skirt (3) and the finger 
skirt (4). 
Hovercraft according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
a compression spring (23) is 

arranged between the deflection roller (17; 18) and the 
connection point (19) of the cable control to the skirt 

segment (5).  
 
Hovercraft according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 
a safety cable (25) is 

fitted between the connection point (19) of the cable 
control and the deflection roller (17; 18). 
Hovercraft according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 
each laterally shiftable section 

(6, 7, 8, 9) is provided with a control component. 
Hovercraft according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 
the control component comprises a cable 

control device (10, 11, 12, 13), one end of which acts on 
the finger skirt and the other end of which is provided 

with a drive component. 
Hovercraft according to claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that
 
the drive component comprises a 

cable winch (14) fixed in place beneath the bodywork (1) 
of the hovercraft. 
Hovercraft according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 
the sections (6, 7, 8, 9) of 

one side are deflected in one direction. 
Hovercraft according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 
the sections (6, 7, 8, 

9) of both parallel areas are deflected in the same 
direction. 
Hovercraft according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 
only one of the sections 

(6, 7, 8, 9) is deflected. 
Hovercraft according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 
two opposite sections 

(6, 7, 8, 9) are deflected in the same direction or in 
opposite directions.  

 
Hovercraft according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 
two diagonally opposite 

sections (6, 7, 8, 9) are deflected in the same direction. 
Hovercraft according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 
the sections (6, 7, 8, 

9) of both sides are simultaneously pulled inwards.
