<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for displaying CAD drawings by means of a plotter, essentially consisting of a holder for a plotter pen which is movably guided in two coordinates relative to a drawing carrier. The device is characterised by the fact that the drawing carrier, arranged in a rack (6), is constructed in the form of a panel or film (16) having a surface or layer to which the ink of the plotter pen (13) adheres only temporarily and can be removed again by means of an erasing device (17).
