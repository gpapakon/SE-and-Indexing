<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an instant dry yeast 
composition, the production thereof and its use in bakery 
products and beverages. The manufacture of yeast starts with a small sample of 
a pure culture. This sample is used to inoculate the first 
of a series of fermentations in fermentors of successively 
increasing size. The first few are mildly aerated batch 
fermentations. Only the last two (or sometimes three) stages 
are performed using full aeration and incremental feeding of 
molasses. These fed-batch fermentations are carried out in 
fermentors having a volume of 100 m³ or more. Fermentation 
time is typically in the range of 12-20 hours, in which some 
10,000-30,000 kg of compressed yeast is produced. Further processing includes separating the yeast from 
the broth by centrifugation and washing which results in 
yeast cream (17-23% (w/w) dry matter content). The yeast cream may be processed into compressed yeast 
(27-33% (w/w) dry matter content) which is either sold as 
such or extruded and dried to produce active dry yeast (ADY) 
or instant dry yeast (IDY) with moisture contents of 6-8% 
(w/w) and 2-8% (w/w), respectively. In the case of ADY, drying usually takes place in belt 
or rotolouvre (drum) dryers. For IDY production fluidized-bed 
drying is commonly used. Drying of the yeast to a level 
of about 20% water content involves only the evaporation of 
free water. Further reducing of the moisture content 
involves the removal of a portion of the bound water from 
the yeast which may cause damage to the yeast cell membrane. 
In US patent 3,843,800 and US 4,248,420 wetting agents such 
as esters of saturated fatty acids of glycerol and/or fatty  
 
acid esters of propylene glycol are added to preserve the 
desired high direct leavening activity of the yeast during 
the drying step. Dry yeast loses part of its leavening activity during 
the drying process as well as during the rehydration 
procedure. Dry yeasts are still commonly used in the bakery 
trade because of their extended stability and because 
refrigeration is unnecessary. Dry yeasts are used in wine 
making to obtain a fast and reproducible fermentation 
thereby minimizing the risk of failure of the natural 
fermentation. Moreover, the yeast is immediately available 
throughout the year. Instant dry yeast (IDY) is the latest type of baker's 
yeast, introduced in the early 1970's (see for example 
US patent 3,843,800) a few years later followed by instant 
dry wine yeast (IWY), which can be seen as a special form of 
instant
