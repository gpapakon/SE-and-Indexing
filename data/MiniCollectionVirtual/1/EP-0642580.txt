<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns amino acid variants of
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), methods and means for preparing such
variants, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.HGF was identified initially as a mitogen for hepatocytes
[Michalopoulos et al., Cancer Res.44, 4414-4419 (1984); Russel et al.,
J. Cell. Physiol.119, 183-192 (1984) and Nakamura et al., Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm.122:1450-1459 (1984)]. Nakamura et al., Supra
reported the purification of HGF from the serum of partially
hepatectomized rats. Subsequently, HGF was purified from rat
platelets, and its subunit structure was determined [Nakamura et al.,
Proc. Katl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83, 6489-6493 (1986); and Nakamura et al.,
FEBS Letters224, 311-316 (1987)]. The purification of human HGF
(huHGF) from human plasma was first described by Gohda et al., J.
Clin. Invest.81, 414-419 (1988).Both rat HGF and huHGF have been molecularly cloned, including
the cloning and sequencing of a naturally occurring variant lacking 5
amino acids designated "deltas HGF" [Miyazawa et al., Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm.163, 967-973 (1989); Nakamura et al., Nature342,
440-443 (1989); Seki et al, Biochem. and Biophys. Res. Commun.172,
321-327 (1990); Tashiro et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA87, 3200-3204
(1990); Okajima et al., Eur. J. Biochem.193, 375-381 (1990)].The mature form of huHGF, corresponding to the major form
purified from human serum, is a disulfide linked heterodimer derived
by proteolytic cleavage of the human pro-hormone between amino acids
R494 and V495. This cleavage process generates a molecule composed of
an α-subunit of 440 amino acids (Mr 69 kDa) and a β-subunit of 234
amino acids (Mr 34 kDa). The nucleotide sequence of the hHGF cDNA
reveals that both the α- and the β-chains are contained in a single
open reading frame coding for a pre-pro precursor protein. In the
predicted primary structure of mature hHGF, an interchain S-S bridge
is formed between Cys 487 of the α-chain and Cys 604 in the β-chain
(see Nakamura et al., Nature,supra). The N-terminus of the α-chain 
is preceded by 54 amino acids, starting with a methionine group. This
segment includes a characteristic hydrophobic leader (signal) sequence
of 31 residues and the prosequence. The α-chain starts at amino acid
(aa) 55, and contains four Kringle domains. The so called "hairpin
domain" includes amino acid residues 70-96 of wild-type human HGF.
The Kringle 1 domain extends from about aa 128 to about aa 206, the
Kringle 2 domain is between about aa 211 and about aa 288, the
