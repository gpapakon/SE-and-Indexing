<ABSTRACT>
In a radio paging receiver in which a CPU (6) 
stores a received message in one of message areas of a 

message memory (8) as an unconfirmed message and in which 
an announcing section (11-18) carries out a call 

announcement in response to the received message, the CPU 
makes the announcing section announce an unconfirmed 

message full announcement instead of the call 
announcement when each message area is filled with the 

unconfirmed message and when an announcement stop 
instruction is not received from a keyboard (10) within a 

predetermined time interval from a time instant at which 
the call announcement is started. The unconfirmed 

message full announcement has an announcing pattern which 
is different from that of the call announcement. When 

the instruction is received within the predetermined time 
interval, the CPU makes the announcing section stop the 

call announcement and makes the message memory memorize 
the received message in the above-mentioned one of the 

message areas as a confirmed message instead of the 
unconfirmed message.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio paging receiver 
and, in particular, to a radio paging receiving having a 
message display function. One of conventional radio paging receivers of the 
type described is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model 
Prepublication No. 92243/1990 (Title of Invention: Paging 
Receiver with Message Receiving Function). The radio 
paging receiver disclosed therein has a function of 
protecting unconfirmed messages memorized in a first or 
main memory area of a message memory of, for example, an 
RAM (random access memory) until a possessor of the radio 
paging receiver confirms the unconfirmed message under 
consideration. The unconfirmed message is a message 
which is not yet confirmed by the possessor. For this 
purpose, the radio paging receiver comprises in the 
message memory, in addition to the first memory area for 
successively memorizing a plurality of received messages, 
a second or subsidiary memory area for memorizing an 
oldest reception unconfirmed message among the 
unconfirmed messages that is erased from the first memory 
area. When the oldest reception unconfirmed message is  
 
transferred from the first memory area to the second 
memory area and is thereby memorized in the second memory 
area, this is announced for a predetermined time 
interval. In the above-mentioned conventional radio paging 
receiver, the reception message must be transferred from 
the first memory area to the second memory area when the 
first memory area has no vacant or empty area (that is, 
the first memory area is put in a full state in which the 
first memory area is filled with the reception messages), 
in order to prevent erasure of any unconfirmed message 
before it is confirmed. Necessity of the second memory 
area and a transfer function of the reception message 
from the first memory area to the second memory area 
results in a complicated structure and an increased cost 
of the radio paging receiver. In the above-mentioned radio paging receiver, a 
confirmed message may possibly be erased even if it is 
protected as a protected message (with a protected 
attribute). It is therefore an object of this invention to 
remove the disadvantages of the conventional radio paging 
receiver and to provide a radio paging receiver of a 
simple structure which can assure that any unconfirmed 
message before confirmed by a possessor is never 
overwritten or updated by a newly-received message.  
 It is another object of this invention to provide 
a radio paging receiver of the type described,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A radio paging receiver comprising: receiving 
means (1-6, 9, S1) for receiving a radio signal 

comprising a message and destined to said receiver and 
for producing said message as a received message; a 

message memory (8) having a plurality of message areas; 
storing means (6, S3, S8, S12-S14) for storing said 

received message in one of said message areas as an 
unconfirmed message; announcing means (11-18, S15) for 

carrying out a call announcement in response to said 
received message to announce reception of said received 

message; instruction producing means (10) for producing 
an announcement stop instruction; first detecting means 

(6, S16, S18) connected to said announcing means and said 
instruction producing means for detecting whether or not 

said announcement stop instruction is received within a 
predetermined time interval from a first time instant at 

which said announcing means begins to carry out said call 
announcement; and first control means (6, S17) connected 

to said announcing means and said first detecting means 
for controlling, when said first detecting means detects 

that said announcement stop instruction is received 
within said predetermined time interval, said announcing 

means and said message memory so that said announcing 
means stops said call announcement and that said message 

memory memorizes said received message in said one of the 
message areas as a confirmed message instead of said  

 
unconfirmed message, characterized by: 


second detecting means (6, S20) connected to said 
message memory and said first detecting means for 

detecting that each of said message areas is filled with 
said unconfirmed message when said first detecting means
