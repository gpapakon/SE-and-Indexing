<ABSTRACT>
A picking apparatus for an injection moulding machine with two movable 
tool tables (2, 3) includes a substantially cylindrical guide portion (10) 

fixedly connected to the one tool table (2), with a helical groove as cam 
device, and a sleeve (13) displaceable along and rotary about the guide 

portion (10), the sleeve having a cam follower member (23) engaging in the 
cam groove. The sleeve is rotary but axially fixedly connected to the second 

table (3). A picking arm (15) is disposed on a carrier portion (18) which, via 
guides, is displaceable parallel with the axial direction of the sleeve (13). A 

cylinder unit (20) is provided for displacement of the carrier portion (18) 
relative to the sleeve (13), whereby the picking arm, partly under the action 

of the groove and the cam follower member, is pivotal in between the tool 
tables (2, 3) on opening thereof, and is pivotal out therefrom on closure, and 

partly displaceable under the action of the cylinder unit (20) in the 
longitudinal direction of the guide portion (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a picking apparatus for such a machine as
has two mutually reciprocating tool tables, preferably an injection moulding
machine, and comprises a cam arrangement, with an approximately helical
cam device and a cooperating cam follower, the cam device and the cam
follower being interconnected each to one of the tool tables in order to realise
a revolving movement on movement of the tool tables, this revolving
movement being transferable to a picking arm which, on movement of the
tool tables away from one another, is pivotal in between the tool tables and
which, on movement of the tool tables towards one another, is pivotal out
therefrom.An apparatus of the type mentioned by way of introduction is previously
known in the art,
see e.g. US-A-3 947 208 or US-A-4 368 018,
and has its cam arrangement designed as two elongate,
approximately spiralled rails which are secured in an injection moulding
machine with the longitudinal direction parallel to the opening and closing
direction of the machine. The cam arrangement is mounted on the upper
side of the fixed tool table and extends out over the injection assembly of the
machine.In cooperation with the cam arrangement, the prior art construction displays
a cam follower which engages, with a number of rollers, with the cam device
and which has a long rod extending over both of the tool tables, the rod
being rotary but axially fixed in an anchorage device on the movable tool
table of the machine. The above-mentioned rod hereby extends straight over
that area which is provided for mounting of moulding tools. A picking arm
is non-rotationally fixed to the above-mentioned rod and is curved
approximately U-shaped so that its free end is located out beside the
injection moulding machine. On opening of the machine, the picking arm is
pivoted with its free end in between the tool tables where a gripper provided
on the picking arm may grasp an object in a moulding tool. When the 
machine is once again closed, the picking arm is pivoted out, with the
grasped object which may either be released in order to drop down into
some receptacle device, or possibly be transferred direct to a conveyor or
similar arrangement.In the prior art apparatus, the picking arm is thus driven by the movements
of the tool table of the injection moulding machine, for which reason the
movements of the picking arm are wholly synchronised with the work cycle
of the injection moulding machine.The prior art apparatus further includes means for displacing, in the
longitudi

<CLAIMS>
A picking apparatus for such a machine as has two mutually reciprocating
tool tables (2) and (3), preferably an injection moulding machine, comprising

a cam arrangement, with an approximately helical cam device (11) and a
cooperating cam follower, the cam device and the cam follower being

interconnected each to one of the tool tables in order to realise a revolving
movement on movement of the tool tables, this revolving movement being

transferable to a picking arm (15) which, on movement of the tool tables
away from one another, is pivotal in therebetween and which, on movement

of the tool tables towards one another, is pivotal out therefrom,

characterized in that
 the cam arrangement includes a substantially
cylindrical guide portion (10) which is non-rotatably connected to the one

tool table (2) and which carries the cam device (11); 
that
 the cam follower
includes a sleeve (13) slidable on the guide portion and rotary about the

guide portion, the sleeve carrying a cam follower member (23) and being
rotary but axially fixedly connected to the second tool table (3); 
and that
 the
picking arm (15) is connected to the sleeve.
The picking apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
guide portion (10) is, with its longitudinal direction, parallel with the

longitudinal direction of a guide (5) along which one of the tool tables (3) is
movable.
The picking apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the
guide portion (10) has an anchorage (9) which has alignment means (26) for

cooperation with the guide (5).
The picking apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the
sleeve (13) has an anchorage (12) in relation to which it is rotary about its

centre axis but is axially fixed; and that the anchorage has alignment means
(26) for cooperation with the guide (5).
The picking apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 an end
section of the guide portion facing away from the anchorage (9) of the guide

portion (10) is movable through the sleeve (13) and its anchorage (12).
