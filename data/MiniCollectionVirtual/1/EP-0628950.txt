<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head having a pair of magnetic cores defining a 
magnetic gap in-between is disclosed. The side of each magnetic 

core facing a recording medium is formed of a single-crystal 
ferrite, with the remaining portions of each magnetic core being 

formed of poly-crystal ferrite. The surface of the magnetic core 
facing the recording medium and the abutment surface of the 

magnetic core are the {100} plane and the {100} plane of the 
single-crystal ferrite, respectively. The magnetic head has 

excellent abrasion resistance and electro-magnetic conversion 
characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic head incorporated into
a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus, such as a VTR or a
data storage device.In the magnetic head, incorporated into the magnetic
recording/reproducing apparatus, such as the VTR or the data
storage device, a magnetic material formed of single-crystal
ferrite is commonly employed as the material constituting a
magnetic core.The magnetic head is made up of magnetic core halves 81, 82,
facing each other via a front gap g7 and a back gap g8 as a
boundary and abutted and bonded to each other, as shown in
Fig.12. Each of the magnetic cores 81, 82 is formed of single-crystal
ferrite. Track width suppression grooves 83, 84 are
provided on the junction surfaces of the magnetic cores 81, 82
for restricting the track width of the magnetic gap g7.Fused glass 87 is charged in the fused state in the track
width suppressing grooves 83, 84 for bonding the magnetic cores
81, 82 together. Coil winding slots 89, 90 and winding guide
slots 91, 92 are formed on the abutment surfaces and on the
lateral surfaces of the magnetic cores 81, 82 so that coils, not
shown, may be placed and wound via the coil winding slots 89, 90.With the above-described magnetic heads, single-crystal
ferrite is extensively used as the constituent material for the 
magnetic core. However, if the single-crystal ferrite is used,
the ultimate magnetic head is changed significantly in abrasion
resistance or electro-magnetic characteristics due to the
difference in the orientation of the slicing surface.Consequently, the selection of the crystal orientation is
crucial when slicing a magnetic head from an ingot of the single-crystal
ferrite. For example, with the use of the Mn-Zn single-crystal
ferrite, there have hitherto been known a β ferrite head
having, for a surface facing the recording medium (medium facing
surface), an abutting surface and a lateral surface, the planes
{110}, {100} and {110}, and a J ferrite head having, for the
medium facing surface, the abutting surface and the lateral
surface, the {211}, {111} and {110} planes, respectively.However, the β and J ferrite heads have their own merits and
demerits. That is, since the {211} plane is not satisfactory in
abrasion resistance, as shown for example in Fig.13, the magnetic
head formed of J ferrite has a drawback that it is not
satisfactory in the abrasion resistance. On the other hand, with
the magnetic heads which is extensively used in VHS system, the
electro-magnetic conversion characteristics of the magnetic head
formed
