<ABSTRACT>
A remotely controlled circuit breaker includes a mechanism (42) linked to the handle (24) by a drive lever (58) equipped with a wheel (68) interacting with a resetting cam (64) of a spring-type (50) energy accumulator (48). A support surface (104) is arranged to lock the wheel (68) in set position, without requiring the presence of a special lock-in stage, given that the line of action of the reaction R of the wheel (68) passes through the transmission shaft (66) of the cam (64). A stepper motor of the vibrating type drives the transmission shaft (66) in rotation, and allows near-instantaneous stopping of the cam (64) when the wheel (68) is in contact with the support surface (104).

unit (11) and of a multipole circuit breaker (12) with an insulating case (13),
 
the circuit breaker (12) housing : 


a first toggle mechanism (20) associated to an automatic trip device (22), and to an 
operating handle (24), 
a system of separable contacts (14) per pole, actuated by a switching bar (18) 
mechanically connected to the first mechanism (20), 
 
the remote control unit (11) being able to be adjoined to the front panel of the case 

(13) and comprising : 

a transmission rack (110) in which the handle (24) of the circuit breaker (12) 
engages, 
a second mechanism (42) connected to the rack (110) by a drive lever (58), and 
equipped with a recharging cam (64) driven by a geared motor device (74) or by an 

emergency manual control (76), to store mechanical energy in at least one closing 
spring (50), said cam (64) having a first charging sector (70), and a second sector 

(72) for releasing a roller (68) securedly united to the drive lever (58), 
 
characterized in that the recharging cam (64) comprises a bearing surface (104) 

shaped to stabilize the roller (68) in the charged position of the drive lever (58) due to 
the passage of the line of action of the reaction R of the roller (68) by the transmission 

shaft (66) of the recharging cam (64), and that the geared motor (74) is provided with 
means for achieving almost instantaneous stopping of the recharging cam (64) when 

the roller (68) reaches the vicinity of the bearing surface (104). 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
drive lever (58) is pivotally mounted on a spindle (60) supported by two support plates 

(44, 46), said lever comprising a transmission finger (56) on which the energy storage 
system (48) of the closing spring (50) is articulated, and that the bearing surface (104) 

is arranged between the first sector (70) and the second sector (72) of the recharging 

cam (64).

characterized in that the transmission shaft (66) of the recharging cam has one end 

linked to a speed reducer (78, 80) driven by an electric motor (82), and an opposite 
end mechanically connected to the emergency manual control (76), and that means 

cooperate with the motor (82) and manual control (76) to drive the transmission shaft 
(66) in the same direction of rotation. 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
electric motor (82) is of the vibrating type having an excitation electromagnet (98), 

and an armature (100) with alternate oscillating movement cooperating with a 
unidirectional free-wheel transmission system, transforming the vibrating movement 

of the armature (100) into a step-by-step rotational movement 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the second mechanism (42) is provided with a first manual closing push-button 

(94) cooperating with means (90, 92) for moving the recharging cam (64) to the 
discharged position, in which the roller (68) is close to the second sector (72) enabling 

high-speed relaxation of the closing spring (50). 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 7, characterized in that 
said means for moving the recharging cam (64) comprise a first auxiliary cam (90) 

keyed onto the transmission shaft (66), and an intermediate drive lever (92) arranged 
between the first auxiliary cam (90) and the first push-button (94). 
The remote controlled circuit breaker according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the second mechanism (42) is provided with a second manual opening push-button 

(106) cooperating with a tripping pushrod (108) of the first mechanism (20).
