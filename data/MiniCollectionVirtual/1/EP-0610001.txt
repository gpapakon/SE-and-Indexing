<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker includes a diaphragm, a bobbin, a voice 
coil and a magnetic circuit. The diaphragm is formed of one 

of materials selected from paper, high molecular materials, 
metallic materials and cellulose. The bobbin is connected 

to the diaphragm and formed of cellulose produced by 
bacterial cultivation. The voice coil is wound on the 

bobbin. The magnetic circuit has a yoke, a plate and 
a permanent magnet and is arranged facing the voice coil. 

The loudspeaker has satisfactory acoustic properties and 
high fidelity in sound reproduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a loudspeaker. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a loudspeaker
having a diaphragm and a bobbin carrying a voice coil wound
thereon. For example, EP-A-0,256,743, on which the two part
form of claim 1 is based, discloses a loudspeaker
comprising: a diaphragm; a bobbin connected to said
diaphragm; a voice coil wound on said bobbin; and a magnetic
circuit arranged facing said voice coil.In a dynamic loudspeaker having a diaphragm and a coil
bobbin wound with a driving coil, the driving coil is
magnetically connected to a magnetic circuit including a
magnet and magnetic components and is placed in a uniform
magnetic field. Consequently, if the current according to
acoustic signals, such as voice signals, is allowed to flow
through the driving coil, the bobbin is set into
oscillations which are transmitted to the diaphragm for
outputting the reproduced sound based on the acoustic
signals.As diaphragm, a conical-shaped diaphragm for mid- to
low-frequency sounds and a hemispherical-shaped dome
diaphragm for high-frequency sound are commonly employed.
The diaphragm for low-frequency sound is normally formed of
paper, high molecular weight polymers or aluminum, while the
diaphragm for high-frequency sound is normally formed of 
paper, films of high molecular weight polymers such as
polypropyline or polyethylene terephthalate cloths, or
metallic materials. EP-A-0,457,474 discloses manufacturing
an acoustic diaphragm for a loudspeaker from cellulose
produced by bacterial cultivation.The diaphragm is connected to a voice coil bobbin wound
with the driving coil or voice coil. The cone-shaped
diaphragm has the apex of the cone as an opening to which
the bobbin is bonded with an adhesive. The dome-shaped
diaphragm has an opening at a lower area of the hemisphere
to which the bobbin is bonded with an adhesive. The voice
coil bobbin is usually formed of paper or aluminum.With the dynamic loudspeaker, as described above, the
voice coil bobbin is driven into oscillations by changes in
the acoustic current flowing through the driving coil.
These oscillation are transmitted to the diaphragm. For
this reason, the bobbin material is preferably lightweight
and of higher toughness. The voice coil bobbin is usually
formed of paper or aluminum. If the bobbin is formed of
paper, having the Young's modulus on the order of 1.5 to
2 (GPa) and being of low toughness, it is impossible to
transmit the oscillations satisfactorily to the diaphragm.
If the bobbin is formed of aluminum, the
