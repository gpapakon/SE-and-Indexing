<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-dependent switch (10) for opening and closing a circuit as a function of the temperature of a bimetallic part (26) has an electrically conductive housing part (12) with a lower side (13). Furthermore, an electrically conductive cover part (16) is provided in order to close the housing part (12). An insulating disc (washer) (17), which electrically insulates the housing part (12) from the cover part (16), is arranged between the housing part (12) and the cover part (16). Arranged in the housing part (12) is a switching mechanism (15) which produces or opens an electrical contact between the housing part (12) and the cover part (16) as a function of the temperature of the bimetallic part (26), it being possible to connect the circuit on the one hand to the cover part (16) and on the other hand to the housing part (12). The housing part (12) is provided with a shoulder (35) which is set back with respect to the lower side (13).

Temperature-dependent switch (10, 10') for opening and 

closing an electric circuit in dependence of a temperature of 
said bimetallic part (26), comprising: 


an electrically conductive housing member (12) having 
an underside (13); 
an electrically conductive cover member (16) for 
closing said housing member (12); 
an insulating disk (17) between said housing member 
(12) and said cover member (16) for electrically isolating the 

housing member (12) from the cover member (16); 
a switching device (15) provided in the housing 
member (12), which switching device makes or breaks an electrical 

contact between said housing member (12) and said cover member 
(16) in dependence of the temperature of a bimetallic part (26); 
 
   whereby said electric circuit is to be connected on the 

one hand to the cover member (16) and on the other hand to the 
housing member (12),
 
   characterized in that said housing member (12) is provided 

with an external collar means inset from said underside (16), 
for connecting with a stranded wire or terminal lug (33). 
Switch according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
switching device (15) comprises an electrically conductive spring 

washer (21) which acts against the bimetallic part (26) depending 
on the temperature of this part, whereby this spring washer 

rests on the housing member (12) and bears a contact part (22) 
which makes contact with the cover member (16) depending on  

 
the temperature of the bimetallic part (26), thus making an 

electrical connection between the housing member (12) and cover 
member (16), whereby the bimetallic part (26) is preferably 

a bimetallic snap washer (27). 
Switch according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
contact part (22) is permanently fixed to the spring washer 

(21), preferably by welding. 
Switch according to any of claims 1 - 3, characterized 
in that a terminal lug (33) is provided whose first end (34) 

is connected to the collar (35), preferably by welding, and 
whose second end (36) opposite to the first end (34) serves 

as a terminal. 
Switch according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
collar (35) is a circumferential ring collar (35) and the first 

end (34) of the terminal lug (33) is of a ring-shaped design. 
Switch according to claim 4 or claim 5, characterized in 
that the terminal lug (33) is bent in such a way that its second 

end (36) is inset with respesct to the collar (35). 
Switch according to any of claims 1 - 6, characterized 
in that a further terminal lug (38) is provided whose first 

end (39) is connected to the cover means (16), preferably by 
welding, and whose second end (40) opposite to the first end 

(39) serves as a terminal. 
Switch according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
second terminal lug (38) is bent in such a way that its second 

end (40) is inset from the first end (39). 
Switch according to any of claims 4 - 8, characterized 
in that the terminal lugs (33, 38) are stampings, preferably 

of sheet steel.  
 
Switch according to any of claims 1 - 9, characterized 
in that the housing member (12) is a deep-drawn housing part. 
Switch according to any of claims 2 - 10, characterized 
in that in the cover member (16) there is provided a countercontact 

(24) for the contact part (21). 
Switch according to claim 7 and 11, characterized in that 
the second terminal lug (38) and the countercontact (24) are 

welded on in one operating cycle. 
Switch according to any of claims 1 - 12, characterized 
in that the insulating disk (17) has been fixed to the cover 

member (16) before assembly. 
Switch according to claim 13, characterized in that the 
insulating disk (17) is stuck to the cover member (16), at least 

in sections.
