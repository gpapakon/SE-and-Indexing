<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gastrostomy feeding ports 
which are designed to be inserted through an opening in the 
wall of the abdomen and stomach of a patient for supplying 
nutrients, medicaments and other fluids to the patient's 
stomach. These feeding ports are useful in feeding and 
providing medical treatment to patients who are comatose or 
otherwise unconscious or unable to orally ingest food or 
medicine. U.S. patent no. 4,863,438 describes a low profile 
gastrostomy device which includes a flexible, hollow tube 
portion having a resilently deformable mushroom-shaped tip at 
the inner end and a pair of flat wings at the outer end. U.S. patent no. 4,795,430 describes a device for 
intubating an ostomy having a fluid delivery lumen, an 
inflation lumen and an inflatable retention member. The 
device has a port near one end to dispose the inflation lumen 
to ambient air and an outlet at the other end to convey fluid 
from within the fluid delivery lumen into a patient. U.S. patent no. 4,834,712 describes a device for angular 
fixation of a delivery or drainage tube at the point where 
the tube exits through the skin from a body cavity. The 
components include a sleeve disposed along the feeding tube 
and a base elbow unit through which the feeding tube passes. 
The base elbow unit includes a subdermal portion, a sleeve 
engaging portion and a cylindrical tube engaging portion.  U.S. patent no. 5,084,014 describes a low profile 
gastrostomy device, for endoscopic placement in an incision 
provided through the stomach and abdominal walls of a 
patient, which has a collapsed resilient end portion within a 
shroud. The device is placed through the incision and the 
end portion expands to its normal size upon removal of the 
shroud. U.S. Design patent no. Des. 328,787 shows the ornamental 
design for a percutaneous replacement gastrostomy tube. U.S. patent no. 4,944,732 describes a gastrostomy 
feeding port which includes a deformable conical tip portion 
having at least one side aperture therethrough, a tube 
portion extending rearwardly from the tip portion, a fitting 
portion on the rear end of the tube portion, a removable 
valve portion in the fitting portion, and a flange portion 
extending outwardly from the fitting portion. The present invention is an improvement on the prior art 
devices, particularly the device of U.S. patent no. 
4,944,732. The present invention overcomes the deficiency of 
the prior art devices which were limited to a specific length 
for each device. Thus, the prior devices

<CLAIMS>
A gastrostomy feeding port comprising a retaining flange 
portion, a middle tube portion and a tip portion; said flange 

portion being attached to and in open communication with the 
interior of said tube portion; said tip portion being 

attached to said tube portion opposite said flange portion, 
and being in open communication with the interior of said 

tube portion, and being receivable through a pre-established 
stoma in the stomach of a patient, and being operative for 

passing a fluid into said stomach, and said tip portion 
having anchoring means connecting said tip portion to said 

tube portion; said anchoring means being elastically 
deformable toward said tip portion and engageable with the 

inner wall of said stomach at various lengths along said tube 
portion for preventing the inadvertent removal of said 

feeding port from said stoma. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said tip 
portion is of hollow conical configuration. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said 
flange portion has a valve disposed substantially therein, 

said valve being operative for permitting the flow of a fluid 
from said flange portion into said tube portion and for 

preventing the reverse flow of said fluid. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 3 wherein said valve 
comprises a duck-bill type valve. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 3 wherein said valve 
is removeably received in said flange portion. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said 
anchoring means has a concave exterior configuration. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said 
anchoring means is elastically deformable and engagable with 

said stomach at various lengths from about 0.5 inches to 
about 2.0 inches along the axis of said tube portion measured 

from said flange portion. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 7 wherein said 
lengths along the axis of said tube portion is about 

0.58-0.88; 0.88-1.18; 1.18-1.48; or 1.48-1.78 inches. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said tip 
portion contains one or more side apertures. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said 
flange portion has a resilient concave configuration facing 

toward said tip portion. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 comprised of a 
plastic or a natural or synthetic rubber. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 11 comprised of 
silicone rubber. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said 
flange portion contains a plug for removably sealing said 

feeding port. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 substantially as 
shown in Figures 1-5. 
A method of feeding a patient which comprises the use of 
a gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 having a plurality 
of slits in said tip portion. 
A gastrostomy feeding port of Claim 1 wherein said tip 
portion has been collapsed and said feeding port has been 

loaded into a semi-rigid casing tube.
