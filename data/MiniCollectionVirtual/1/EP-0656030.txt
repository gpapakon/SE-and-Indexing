<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stabilizer systems for curable
thiol-ene formulations. More particularly, the invention relates to
a stabilizer system comprising an alkenyl substituted phenolic
compound in combination with one or more of the following compounds:
a quinone free radical scavenger, a hindered phenolic antioxidant, or a
hydroxylamine.The synthesis of polythioethers by crosslinking polyenes with
polythiols is well-known in the art. These compositions can be cured
by photopolymerization initiated by actinic radiation, in particular
radiation in the UV-visible range, or by the use of high energy
electron beam radiation or by exposure of the reactants to chemical
free radical generating agents.A preferred group of thiol-ene compositions are those in which
the ene is a bicyclic compound such as norbornene as described in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,808,638. These thiol-nene compositions are useful
in a variety or applications because of their rapid photocure speeds
and the wide variety of cured product profiles available to the
formulator. Though thiol-nene compositions have many advantages, it is
difficult to stabilize them, especially to attain long term shelf
stability. Formulations which have long term shelf stability are
defined as those which do not double their viscosity in six months
at room temperature. An increase in viscosity indicates that a
spontaneous oligomerization reaction is occuring between the polyene
and the polythiol. In extreme cases, the unstable formulations will
result in intractable, insoluble gels.Conventional stabilizers for thiol-ene formulations include
hydroquinone, p-tert butyl catechol, 2,6-ditert-butyl-p-methylphenol,
phenothizaine, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, inert gas atmospheres such
as helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and acidic stabilizers
such as phosphorous acid as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,303.
Additional stabilizers include the free radical scavenger vinyl
stabilizers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,619,393 and the metal complexes
of N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
4,985.471. However, these conventional stabilizers are not effective
in thiol-nene formulations. This is probably because norbornenyl
groups are almost an order of magnitude more reactive with polythiols
than are ones such as butyl vinyl ether as disclosed in Radiation
Curing of Polymeric Materials, Hoyle & Kinstle eds., ACS Symposium
Series 417, pgs 165-167.Several references have proposed stabilizers specifically for
thiol-nene formulations. For example, EPO
