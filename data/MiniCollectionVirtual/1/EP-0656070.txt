<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid sequences which hybridize preferentially to the 16S or 23S rRNA or rDNA of Legionella sp., L. pneumophila, L. Micdadei, an L. pneumophila, or a Legionella subset are taught. These organisms are the etiological agents of Legionaires' disease, Pontiac fever, Pittsburgh pneumonia and other infections. The nucleic acids are useful in the detection of these pathogenic microorganisms, such as in sandwich assays. Probes based on these sequences and kits containing the probes are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NUCLEIC ACID PROBES FOR BACTERIA OF THE GENUS LEGIONELLAThis invention relates to nucleic acids, probes, kits, and methods for the detection of pathogenic organisms, including Legionella sp., believed to be involved with Legionnaire's disease, Pontiac fever, Pittsburgh pneumonia, and several other diseases.Background of the InventionLegionella were first discovered in 1976 following an outbreak of 182 cases of pneumonic illness (termed Legionnaires' disease) occurred at a state convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which resulted in 29 deaths. What is now known as L. pneumophila serotype 1 was originally isolated by standard techniques for the isolation of rickettsiae and subsequently shown to be the etiological agent for Legion-naires' disease, a form of atypical pneumonia with other non-respiratory complications. Since that first outbreak, Legionellae have been implicated in Pontiac fever and Pittsburgh pneumonia. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic febrile self-limiting illness caused by L. pneumophila. Pittsburgh pneumonia is a pulmonary legionellosis caused by L. micdadei.Legionellae are gram negative, aerobic, facultative intracellular, parasitic bacteria found to be practically ubiquitous in fresh water supplies (including evaporative condensers, cooling towers, and potable water). It is believed that Legionellae cause disease when contaminated water is inhaled, often leading to epidemic or clustered outbreaks. In addition to community-acquired cases, legionellae may be a major cause of nosocomial infections. Along with hospitalization, host risk factors include smoking, advanced age, chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression. 

 The family Legionellaceae contains the single genus Legionella which includes some 29 species, 21 serogroups and 5 tentatively named species. According to DNA homology studies, L. micdadei is the most distant relative of L. pneumophila, and there is some who argue that L. micdadei should be properly classified as a member of the genus Tatlockia.L. pneumophila, the primary cause of Legionnaire's disease, is the most common human isolate. The presence of legionellae in human clinical samples always provides clinically relevant information, as the bacteria are not considered normal human microflora. Legionellae are slow growing organisms which are difficult to culture. Thus, isolation of L. pneumophila by laboratories can be difficult and time-consuming. Given the serious nature of the diseases, and the need to prescribe correct antibiotics, it is
