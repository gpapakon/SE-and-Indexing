<ABSTRACT>
Two annular pressure pockets (12,13) are used to push 
the orbiting scroll (10) against the fixed scroll (11) to 

minimize leakage. One pocket (13) is at intermediate pres­
sure and the other (12) is at discharge pressure. The 

pockets (12,13) are defined by the orbiting scroll (10) and 
an axial ring (16). In the preferred embodiment inner and 

outer seals (22,24) are carried by the axial ring (16)and 
an intermediate seal (23) is carried by the orbiting scroll 

(10) whereby the pressure pockets (12,13) are of an eccen­
tric configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an axial compliance means 
for a scroll compressor. In a scroll compressor the trapped volumes are in the shape 
of lunettes and are defined between the wraps or elements of 
the fixed and orbiting scrolls and their end plates. The 
lunettes extend for approximately 360° with the ends of the 
lunettes defining points of tangency or contact between the 
wraps of the fixed and orbiting scrolls. These points of 
tangency or contact are transient in that they are 
continuously moving towards the center of the wraps as the 
trapped volumes continue to reduce in size until they are 
exposed to the outlet port. As the trapped volumes are 
reduced in volume the ever increasing pressure acts on the 
wrap and end plate of the orbiting scroll tending to axially 
and radially move the orbiting scroll with respect to the 
fixed scroll. Radial movement of the orbiting scroll away from the fixed 
scroll is controlled through radial compliance. Eccentric 
bushings, swing link connections and slider blocks have all 
been disclosed for achieving radial compliance. Each 
approach ultimately relies upon the centrifugal force 
produced through the rotation of the crankshaft to keep the 
wraps in sealing contact. Axial movement of the orbiting scroll away from the fixed 
scroll produces a thrust force. The weight of the orbiting 
scroll, crankshaft and rotor may act with, oppose or have no 
significant impact upon the thrust force depending upon 
whether the compressor is vertical or horizontal and, if 
vertical, whether the motor is above or below the orbiting 
scroll. Also, the highest pressures correspond to the 
smallest volumes so that the greatest thrust loadings are 
produced in the central portion of the orbiting scroll but  
 
over a limited area. The thrust forces push the orbiting 
scroll against the crankcase with a large potential 
frictional loading and resultant wear. A number of 
approaches have been used to counter the thrust forces such 
as thrust bearings and a fluid pressure back bias on the 
orbiting scroll. Discharge pressure and intermediate 
pressure from the trapped volumes as well as an external 
pressure source have been used to provide the back bias. 
Specifically, U.S. Patents 3,600,114, 3,924,977 and 3,994,633 
utilize a single fluid pressure chamber to provide a scroll 
biasing force. This approach provides a biasing force on the 
orbiting scroll at the expense of very large net thrust 
forces at some operating conditions. As noted, above, the 
high pressure is

<CLAIMS>
An axial compliance means for a scroll 
compressor including a crankcase (30), a fixed scroll 

means (11) and an orbiting scroll means (10;10') having 
a plate with a wrap (10-1) on a first side and an 

annular surface (10-8) on a second side, said axial 
compliance means comprising:
 
   annular ring means (16; 16') fixed with 

respect to said crankcase (30) and coacting with said 
annular surface (10-8) to define a plurality of radially 

spaced annular pocket means (12, 13),
 
   said pocket means (12,13) being sealed by 

inner, intermediate and outer radially spaced seals 
(22,23,24), and
 
   fluid pressure supply means (10-2 to 10-7) 

for supplying pressurized fluid from different trapped volume 
(A-E) to each of said pocket means (12,13) whereby 

fluid pressure supplied to said pocket means (12,13) 
acts on said orbiting scroll means (10;10') to keep said 

orbiting scroll means (10;10') in axial engagement with 
said fixed scroll means (11) and spaced from said 

annular ring means (16;16'),
 
   characterized in that at least said inner 

and outer radially spaced seals (24,22) are carried by 
said fixed annular ring means (16;16') to thereby 

support said orbiting scroll means (10;10') in 
engagement with said fixed scroll means (11).

characterized in that said intermediate radially spaced 

seal (23) is carried by said orbiting scroll means 
(10'). 
The axial compliance means of claim 1, 
characterized in that said fluid pressure supply means 

includes first pressure supply means (10-2, 10-4, 10-5) 
and second fluid pressure supply means (10-3, 10-6, 10-7) 

which are in fluid communication with trapped volumes
