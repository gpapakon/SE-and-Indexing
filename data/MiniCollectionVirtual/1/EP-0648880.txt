<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for positioning the foot portion of manufactured tubular knitted products, comprising, for each manufactured product, a tube (1) for supporting the manufactured product, rotating about its longitudinal axis (a-a), and one or more corresponding photoelectric cells (6) for detecting one or more markers appropriately inserted into the fabric of the manufactured product, in which apparatus the said tube (1) is made from two coaxial elements: the free end (10) of the tube element (1) located in correspondence with the stocking foot being profiled so as to form a receptacle element for a corresponding ram (2) which is coaxial with the tube (1), is connected to a drive member (3) for controlling its rotation at the same time as the corresponding portion of the stocking and is controlled by a corresponding actuating cylinder (4) of horizontal axis for allowing it to move nearer to and further from the tube (1); there being mounted in the vicinity of the free end of each tube (1) a rubber-coated pressure roller (5) rotating freely about an axis (b-b) parallel to that of the tube (1) and intended for compressing the fabric of the stocking foot on the respective support (1) during the rotation of the latter.
