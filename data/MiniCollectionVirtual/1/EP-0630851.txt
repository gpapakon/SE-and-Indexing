<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a shock-resistant magnetic attraction device wherein superposition of magnetic pole 
members at joint portions is avoided to eliminate a repulsive magnetic force due to induction magnetic force of a 

permanent magnet, while completely preventing intrusion of dust which would adversely affect the magnetic force. 
Magnetic force means comprises a large number of units each comprising a cover plate fastened to an upper part 

of front and rear magnetic pole members (1) and having a hook ring, and space retainers (5) rotatably supporting 
thereinside a rotor (6) storing a rotary permanent magnet (7), and storing a fixed permanent magnet (8) in right and left 

recesses formed outside it, and connection means for connecting these units in series. These magnetic pole members 
(1) are arranged while the space retainers (5) are interposed between them so that the pole members (1) are not directly 

superposed with one another, a large number of connection protuberances (5'') are disposed on the front and rear faces 
of these space retainers, and a large number of connection holes (1'''') are formed on the front and rear faces of the 

magnetic pole members (1) so as to connect them with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention deals with a magnetic attraction device,
that is a magnetic holder to be used mainly for transporting and
moving various objects and machinery made of metal and other magnetic
material through the magnetic force of permanent magnets.There have previously been adhesive magnetic devices aimed at
achieving the above objective, most notably as registered in the
Republic of Korea's Practical Inventions Patent Number 56701. In the
said product, however, there are a non-magnet plate inserted in a
rotor equipped with a rotating permanent magnet so that the middle
parts of the front and back are made of non-magnetic material,
distance maintenance mechanisms inserted at the left and right gaps of
the magnetic connecting the left and right side magnets so that various
permanent magnet plates may be fixed therein, and the upper part fixed
with plates with multiple hooks and with various units directly
connected with linking units of screw connecting devices and
connecting hooks; such a design of this product has the following
flaws.First, the front and back magnetic surfaces are both at
overlapping intersections so that there is the flaw of relatively
excessive load and weight at that section stemming from the need for a
screw and its tightening as a means of linkage similar to those of
traditional pipe and piping connections, and the weakness of
self-generated repulsive magnetic force at that intersection due to
the overlapping of the permanent magnets which weakens the linkage
status of the connecting screws, which in turn may sometimes cause
large-scale accidents or at least decrease the effectiveness of the
adhesive magnet due to a weakening of magnetic force. Second, since the front and back magnetic plates are tightened
with bolts, these bolts are easily loosened in case of severe impact
from the outside and may weaken the magnetic force. In other words,
since magnetic holders are equipment of considerable weight which are
manipulated with cranes and are subject to severe impact upon striking
the object to be moved, such severe impact causes the linkage status
of bolt-tightened magnetic parts and plates to be weakened. In case
this should happen, the arrangement of the permanent magnets within
the gaps is also affected, thus not only weakening the flow of the
magnets but also possibly affecting the rotation of the rotor by
altering the shape of the rotor spiral (keyhole) and the screw
attached therein.Third, because the permanent magnets fixed in the left and
right gaps are exposed, the
