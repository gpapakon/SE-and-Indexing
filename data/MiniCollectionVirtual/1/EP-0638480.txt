<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved hand instrument for driving staples in 
the form of small bits of string into sheets of soft material 

comprising a handgun-like body (10) composed of a grip (10a) having a 
hand-operated 

lever (12) fixed therein and a string ejection barrel having 
a hollow needle (26) fixed at its outlet end and a slidable push rod (21) 

fixed therein. The hand-operated lever (12) is so operatively connected 
to the push rod that the push rod (21) is driven and inserted 

in the hollow needle to eject small bits of string one after 
another from the hollow needle every time the hand-operated 

lever is pressed. The hand instrument uses a composite 
resilient mechanism (15,16) to permit application to the hand-operated 

lever a fixed value of return force, thereby assuring that the 
hand-operated lever is used by applying a fixed value of pressing 

force thereto, and that one does not get much tired after 
using the stapler many hundred times without intermission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in or relating 
to a staple fastening instrument or a hand instrument for driving 
staples in the form of small bits of nylon or other resin 
string (called "tag pins" or "nylon pins") into sheets of soft 
material such as selected parts of clothes or other goods for 
fixing tags or connecting together. As shown in Japanese Patent 63-281940(A) and USP 3,924,788, such 
a hand instrument uses a single spring to cause a hand-operated 
lever to return to its original position after driving and 
ejecting a bit of nylon resin string from its hollow needle. The counter resilient force which is applied to the hand-operated 
lever so as to pull it toward its original position 
will increase linearly with the increase of travelling distance 
of the hand-operated lever in driving and ejecting a bit of 
nylon resin string from its hollow needle. The difference between 
the minimum load on the hand-operated lever at the initial 
point and the maximum load thereon at the final position of the 
travelling path of the hand-operated lever is so large that 
one's hand and arm gets badly tired after operating the hand-operated 
lever many hundred times, and in the worst situation 
one may suffer from tendovaginitis. One object of the present invention is to provide a staple fastening 
instrument or hand instrument for driving staples in the 
form of small bits of string into sheets of soft material of 
selected parts of clothes and other goods, and for fixing tags 
on clothes and other goods or connecting together without fear 
of causing great tiredness in one's hand or arm even after using 
many times without intermission. This and other objects can be attained by designing such hand 
instruments so as to keep the load or work done by hand at a 
substantially fixed amount over the travelling distance of the  
 
hand-operated lever, and by reducing the maximum load to the possible 
smallest amount. Specifically a hand instrument for driving staples in the form 
of small bits of string into sheets of soft material comprising 
a handgun-like body composed of a grip having an operating lever 
fixed therein and a string ejection barrel having a hollow 
needle fixed at its outlet end and a slidable push rod fixed 
therein, said operating lever being so operatively connected to 
said push rod that said push rod is driven and inserted in said 
hollow needle to eject small bits of string one after another 
from said hollow needle every time said operating lever is 
pressed further

<CLAIMS>
A hand instrument for driving staples in the form of small 
bits of string into sheets of soft material comprising; a 

handgun-like body (10) composed of a grip (10a) having a hand-operated 
lever (12) fixed therein and a string ejection barrel having a hollow 

needle (26) fixed at its outlet end and a slidable push rod (21) fixed 
therein, said hand-operated lever (12) being so operatively connected 

to said push rod (21) that said push rod (21) is driven and inserted in 
said hollow needle (26) to eject small bits of string one after 

another from said hollow needle (26) every time said hand-operated 
lever (12) is pressed, further comprising an actuating lever (14), said 

actuating lever (14) connected to said hand-operated 
lever (12) and spring-biased to cause it to rotate over a predetermined 

angle about its pivot axle (13) for urging said hand-operated 
lever (12) toward its rest or fully actuated position (A, B) respectively 

all the time, said actuating lever (14) being connected to said push rod 
(21) for driving it back and forth, characterized in that said hand instrument 

comprises a composite resilient mechanism for urging said hand-operated 
lever (12) toward its rest position (A), said composite resilient 

mechanism comprising a first spring means (15) to urge said actuating 
lever (14) toward its rest position (A) with a force increasing 

linearly with the increase of rotation angle and a second spring means 
(16) to apply to said actuating lever (14) a resilient force which 

becomes zero at the intermediate position (C) of rotation, increasing 
in one direction on the way to the rest position (A) beyond the intermediate 

position (C) of rotation, and increasing in the other direction 
on the way to the fully actuated position (B) beyond the intermediate 

position (C) of rotation. 
A hand instrument for driving small bits of string into 
sheets of soft material according to claim 1, wherein said 

second spring means (16) is stretched between a catch pin (19) fixed to 
the actuating lever (14) close to its upper end apart from its pivot 

axle (13) and a first stationary pin (17) fixed to the grip (10a) close 
to the re
ar side of the grip (10a) apart from the pivot axle (13) of the 
actuating lever (14). 
A hand instrument according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said first  
 

spring means (15) is stretched between a catch pin (19) fixed to the actuating 
lever (14) close to its upper end apart from its pivot axle (13) 

and a second stationary pin (24) fixed to the grip (10a) close to the lower 
end of the actuating lever (14).
