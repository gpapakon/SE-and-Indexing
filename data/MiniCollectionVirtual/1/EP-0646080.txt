<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary slide valve (5, 6) with a spring loaded (31) centring system (25). The centring system is to be fitted inside the valve housing (1) without the need for additional structural space in the radial direction. In addition, the return pressure is to be reduced. According to the invention, the spring (31) presses on a reaction piston (32), a centring component (24) of which acts on rolling  bodies (30) in the centring system (25). Between a cover (35) and the reacting piston (32) there is a reaction chamber (37) to which a variable pressure can be applied. At high travelling speeds, a pressure assisting the spring (31) in the reaction chamber (37) acts on a front face (41) of the reaction piston (32). Because the force of reaction pressure supplements that of the spring (31), a smaller spring can be used and space is saved.

<CLAIMS>
A rotary slide vlave, more particularly for hydraulic
power-assisted steering systems, and having the following

features:

A valve sleeve (6) mounted in a casing surrounds a
rotary valve (5);
The valve sleeve (6) is connected to a driving
shaft (4) and to the rotary valve (5) via a steering-wheel

shaft (2) bearing a steering-wheel;
A torsion bar (3) is inserted between the valve sleeve
(6) and the rotary valve (5);
A rolling means (25) is provided between the valve
sleeve (6) and the rotary valve (5) and comprises sloping

surfaces (26, 26A; 27, 27A) with interposed
rolling members (30) and a spring (31) for exact central

adjustment of the rotary slide valve (5, 6) and
the force of the spring (31) acting on the rolling
members (30) can be overlaid by a variable compressive

force acting in a reaction chamber (38);
a reaction piston (32) is intalled between the
spring (31) and the rolling members (30),
characterised
 by the following features:
the reaction chamber (37) lies between the reaction
piston (32) and a cover (35), and the reaction chamber

(37) also receives the spring (31) and
the spring (31) abuts the reaction piston (32) via a
needle bearing (32).
A rotary slide valve according to claim 1,

characterised
 in that the reaction piston
(32) is movable on balls (34) in an axial guide (33).
A rotary slide valve according to claim 1,

characterised
 in that the sloping surfaces
(27, 27A) co-operating with the rotary valve (5) are

machined in a centring member (24) which is firmly connected
to the reaction piston (32) after alignment with the

hydraulic centre.
A rotary slide valve according to claim 1,

characterised
 in that the centring member
(24) is securEd to the reaction piston (32) by laser

welding.
A rotarY slide valve according to claim 1,

characterised
 in that the reaction chamber
(37) is connected to the return flow via a diaphragm

(29).
