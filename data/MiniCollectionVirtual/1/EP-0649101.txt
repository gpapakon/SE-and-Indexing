<ABSTRACT>
When several calculating units intended, together, to evaluate in an iterative and cellular manner the convergence values of a plurality of variables associated respectively with the various points of a predetermined grid each variable having to satisfy a prescribed iterative relation among one another and n neighbouring variables associated with n neighbouring grid points (P2-P5),   - one memory means is assigned per point of the grid, intended for storing successively all the values of the variable associated with this grid point, - the calculating units are distributed in such a way as to assign every grid point to a calculating unit and two distinct calculating units to two chosen neighbouring points of the grid, - all the calculating units are operated in parallel and independently of one another,   and for each current point of the grid,   .the calculating unit assigned to this current point is made to calculate each successive value of the variable associated with this current point from the value contained in the memory means assigned to the current point and those available and arising from the memory means assigned to the points neighbouring the current point, irrespective of the iteration levels to which these available values correspond, and .the said calculating unit is made to store each new value thus calculated in the memory means associated with the current point.
