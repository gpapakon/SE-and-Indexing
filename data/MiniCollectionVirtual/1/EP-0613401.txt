<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a feed accelerator system for use in a centrifuge, the system comprising a conveyor hub
rotatably mounted substantially concentrically within a rotating bowl, and an accelerator including a generally cone-shaped
inside surface having an axially increasing diameter to a discharge end, the inside surface disposed between
an accelerator base and an accelerator small diameter section, whereby the accelerator is secured within the conveyor
hub so that the accelerator rotates with the conveyor hub, a distributor is proximate to the small diameter section, a plurality
of accelerator vanes are disposed on the cone-shaped inside surface so as to form a plurality of feed channels,
and generally extend proximately from the small diameter section and terminate at a location on the cone-shaped inside
surface proximate to the base, and a feed pipe is disposed within the centrifuge for delivering a feed slurry to the accelerator,
the feed pipe including at least one discharge opening located proximately to a feed pipe end so that the discharge
opening is positioned proximately to and faces the distributor surface.Such a feed accelerator system is known from US-A-3,428,246. The feed accelerator system according to US-A-3,428,246
comprises a cross-shaped distributor with a sharp and pronounced junction between a vane assembly and
guide members. The cross-shaped distributor used in the system according to US-A-3,428, 246 results in feed slurry
splashing off of the vane assembly back toward the feed pipe.Conventional sedimentation or filtration systems operating under natural gravity have a limited capacity for separating
a fluid/particle or fluid/fluid mixture, otherwise known as a feed slurry, having density differences between the distinct
phases of the slurry. Therefore, industrial centrifuges that produce large centrifugal acceleration forces, otherwise
known as G-levels, have advantages and thus are commonly used to accomplish separation of the light and heavy
phases. Various designs of industrial centrifuges include, for example, the decanter, screen-bowl, basket, and disc centrifuge.Industrial centrifuges rotate at very high speeds in order to produce large centrifugal acceleration forces. Several
problems arise when the feed slurry is introduced into the separation pool of the centrifuge with a linear circumferential
speed less than that of the centrifuge bowl.First, the centrifugal acceleration for separation is not fully realized. The G-level might be only a fraction of what is
possible.
