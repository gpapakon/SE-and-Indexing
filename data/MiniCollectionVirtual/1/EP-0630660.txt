<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly (10) is provided which includes a housing 
(12) and resilient first seal means (18) associated with 

the housing. The first seal means is preferably a gasket 
having an aperture (20) formed therein for receiving 

surgical instrumentation adapted to cooperate with a 
dilating means (28) having an exterior face associated with 

the housing for dilating the aperture of the gasket. The 
first seal means and the dilating means are adapted for 

relative movement therebetween, the first seal means and 
the dilating means assuming a first position wherein the 

aperture of the first seal means is spaced from the 
dilating means and is adapted to receive surgical 

instrumentation of a first diameter with minimal insertion 
force, and assuming a second position wherein the aperture 

of the first seal means is stretched around the exterior 
face of the dilating means for receiving surgical 

instrumentationof a second diameter greater than the first 
diameter with minimal insertion force.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seal systems which are adapted to allow the introduction
of surgical instrumentation into a patient's body. In particular, the invention is applicable
to a cannula assembly wherein a cannula housing includes or is adapted to receive a seal
assembly to sealingly accommodate instruments of different diameters inserted through the
seal assembly and cannula.US-A-5195980 discloses a hemostatic valve. This document has been taken as the
basis of the pre-characterising part of claim 1 below.In laparoscopic procedures surgery is performed in the interior of the abdomen
through a small incision; in endoscopic procedures surgery is performed in any hollow
viscus of the body through narrow tubes or cannula inserted through a small entrance
incision in the skin. Laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures generally require that any
instrumentation inserted into the body be sealed, i.e. provisions must be made to ensure
that gases do not enter or exit the body through the incision as, for example, in surgical
procedures in which the surgical region is insufflated. Moreover, laparoscopic and
endoscopic procedures often require the surgeon to act on organs, tissues, and vessels far
removed from the incision, thereby requiring that any instruments used in such procedures
be relatively long and narrow.For such procedures, the introduction of a tube 
into certain anatomical cavities such as the abdominal
cavity is usually accomplished by use of a trocar assembly
comprised of a cannula assembly and an obturator assembly.
Since the cannula assembly provides a direct passage for
surgical instrumentation from outside the patient's body to
access internal organs and tissue, it is important that the
cannula assembly maintain a relatively gas-tight interface
between the abdominal cavity and the outside atmosphere.
The cannula assembly thus generally includes a cannula
attached to a cannula housing containing a seal assembly
adapted to maintain a seal across the opening of the
cannula housing.Since surgical procedures in the abdominal cavity
of the body require insufflating gases to raise the cavity
wall away from vital organs, the procedure is usually
initiated by use of a Verres needle through which a gas
such as CO2 is introduced into the body cavity, thereby
creating a pneumoperitoneum. Thereafter, the pointed
obturator of the obturator assembly is inserted into the
cannula assembly and used to puncture the abdominal wall.
The gas provides a positive pressure which raises the inner
body wall away from

<CLAIMS>
A seal assembly (10) which comprises:

(a) a housing (12);
(b) a resilient first seal member (18) associated with said housing, said first
seal member having an aperture (20) formed therein for receiving surgical

instrumentation;
(c) a dilating mechanism (28) having an exterior face associated with said
housing for dilating said aperture of said first seal member;

   wherein said first seal member and said dilating mechanism are adapted for
relative movement therebetween, said first seal member and said dilating

mechanism assuming a first position wherein said aperture of said first seal
member is spaced from said dilating mechanism and is adapted to receive surgical

instrumentation of a first diameter with minimal insertion force, and assuming a
second position wherein said aperture of said first seal member is stretched around

said exterior face of said dilating mechanism for receiving surgical instrumentation
of a second diameter, greater than said first diameter, with minimal insertion force;

the seal assembly being characterised in that:

said housing comprises a bellows (12)

and further in that:
said bellows is adapted to assume an extended position which corresponds
to said first position of said first seal member and said dilating mechanism, and a

collapsed position which corresponds to said second position of said first seal
member and said dilating mechanism.
The seal assembly of claim 1, wherein said housing is adapted to be associated
with a cannula assembly (16).
The seal assembly of claim 1 or 2, wherein said first seal member (18) is substantially
planar and is mounted transverse with respect to said housing.
The seal assembly of any one of the preceding claims, wherein said bellows is
encased within a frame (150).
The seal assembly of claim 4, wherein said frame further comprises a flange (136)
associated with said bellows for moving said bellows between said extended

position and said collapsed position.
The seal assembly of any one of the preceding claims, further comprising biasing
means (162) for biasing said bellows to said extended position.
The seal assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said
dilating mechanism includes a dilator member (28, 128, 228) slidably mounted

relative to said housing.
The seal assembly as in claim 7, wherein said dilating mechanism includes a pair of
elongated members (228a, 228b) pivotably attached to said dilator mechanism and

extending therefrom such that upon sliding movement of said dilator mechanism,
said pair of elongated members pivot and contact said first seal member, thereby

causing said aperture to expand from said first position to said second position.
The seal assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in association
with a cannula assembly. 
The seal assembly of claim 9, wherein said cannula assembly includes a second
seal member (470) which is configured and dimensioned to provide a fluid-tight

seal in the absence of an instrument passing therethrough.
