<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous suspensions of 
colloidal particles which particles are both silica based 
anionic particles and hydrated particles of clays of smectite 
type which expand in water. The invention also relates to a 
process for the production of the suspensions and to the use 
of these as flocculating agents in combination with amphoteric 
or cationic polymers, particularly in the production of paper 
and pulp, but also for water purification. During recent years systems based on anionic colloidal 
particles and cationic or amphoteric synthetic or natural 
polymers have gained an increased use, particularly at the 
production of paper for increasing retention and dewatering. 
The anionic colloidal particles have hereby been silica based 
or have consisted of clay materials such as bentonite. Such 
systems are for example disclosed in the European patents 
41056, 218674 and 0235893. Generally a fairly high amount of 
bentonite is required while the considerably more expensive 
silica sols give good results at substantially lower dosages. 
From the European patent 0310959 it is also known to use both 
silica sol and bentonite together with cationic starch. The 
silica sol and the bentonite can hereby be added simultaneously 
or after each other and it is also indicated that it is 
possible to mix the bentonite with the silica sol just prior 
to addition to the stock. Silica based particles are delivered in the form of 
aqueous sols of varying dry contents, mainly dependent on the 
size of the sol particles. Sol particles are essentially 
spherical. Clay materials, such as for example bentonite, 
shall be hydrated at use to give the desired effect, and in 
this form they cannot be supplied as stable aqueous preparations 
of sufficiently high dry content to be stored and 
transported. Bentonite is thus handled in powder form and 
immediately before use the powder is wetted to give the 
required swelling and high shear forces are necessary to set 
surfaces free. In contrast to silica particles clay particles 
have a flake-like structure. Handling of powder materials is 
not desirable since all handling of powder materials gives  
 
rise to dust problems and dosage problems and since every user 
needs equipment for wetting. According to the present invention it has surprisingly 
been found that it is possible to prepare stable aqueous 
suspensions which contain both colloidal anionic silica based 
particles and colloidal hydrated particles of expandable clays 
of smectite type. The
