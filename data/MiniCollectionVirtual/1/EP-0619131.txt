<ABSTRACT>
A light liquid separator having a feed, a separation chamber and an outlet for the heavy (dense) liquid is provided with an automatic shut-off. The shut-off includes a butterfly valve (14) which is arranged in a descender tube (8) and is connected in a rotationally solid manner to one end of a lower rod (18) of a parallelogram-like linkage (17) which, in addition to a vertical rod (19) articulated to the other end of the rod (18), is provided with an upper rod (20), one end of which is articulated to the vertical rod (19) and the other end of which is articulated to the descender tube (8) above the light liquid surface (10) in an extension of the longitudinal axis of the descender tube. A triggering mechanism (30) which interacts with the linkage (17) and keeps the butterfly valve (14) in an open position can be triggered by a control force dependent on the difference between the specific gravities of the heavy liquid and light liquid. The shut-off constructed as a butterfly valve (14) can be arranged either in the feed or outlet region, that is to say in each case in the region of a vertical descender tube which must be provided in any case. As a result, the surface of the separator can be completely utilised for the separation process and both the feed region and outlet region can be optimally designed hydraulically.

Light liquid separator with an intake (5) for a 
light/heavy liquid mixture, a separator chamber (4) for 

separating the mixture and an outlet (6) for the heavy 
liquid, wherein the intake and/or outlet comprise(s) an 

immersion pipe (8, 12), and with an automatic closure (14) 
which can be controlled by the difference in the relative 

densities of the heavy liquid and the light liquid and is 
formed as a pivoted flap, characterised in that the pivoted 

flap (14) is disposed in the intake or the outlet inside the 
immersion pipe (8) and can pivot about an axis (15) which 

intersects the longitudinal axis of the latter at a right 
angle, that the pivoted flap (14) is connected in a non-rotatable 

manner to one end of a lower rod (18) of a 
parallelogram-like linkage (17) which, in addition to a 

vertical rod (19) flexibly connected to the other end of the 
rod (18), comprises an upper rod (20), one end of which is 

flexibly connected to the vertical rod (19) and the other 
end of which is articulated above the light liquid level 

(10) to the immersion pipe (8) in the extension of the 
longitudinal axis of the latter, and that a release 

mechanism (30, 40) is provided which co-operates with the 
linkage (17), holds the latter in the raised position and 

the pivoted flap (14) in the open position and can be 
released by a control force which is dependent upon the 

difference in the relative densities of the heavy liquid and 
the light liquid, so that the linkage (17) moves downwards 

and the pivoted flap (14) is closed. 
Light liquid separator according to claim 1, 
characterised in that at least one hollow control body (26), 

which can be filled with heavy liquid, is disposed at the 
linkage (17) to augment the control force. 
Light liquid separator according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the control body (26) is fastened to 

the vertical rod (19).  
 
Light liquid separator according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the control body (26) consists of a 

cylindrical pipe whose longitudinal axis extends parallel to 
the vertical rod (19), which pipe is closed at least at the 

lower end and comprises in its upper region an inlet opening 
(27, 57) for the heavy liquid. 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the control body (26) is provided at 

its lower end with a nonreturn valve (29) which allows the 
hollow space to be emptied. 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the release mechanism (30, 40) is 

disposed above the light liquid level (10). 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the release mechanism (30, 40) co-operates 

with a lever (37, 41) which is connected to the 
linkage (17) so as to move with it. 
Light liquid separator according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the lever (37, 41) is disposed 

parallel to the upper rod (20) of the linkage (17). 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that a permanent magnet (31) is provided as 

the release mechanism (30). 
Light liquid separator according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the permanent magnet (31) can be 

displaced parallel to the direction in which the lever (37) 
extends. 
Light liquid separator according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the permanent magnet (31) is mounted 

on a rotatable threaded spindle (32). 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 1 to  
 

8, characterised in that a roll-over bow (44) is provided as 
the release mechanism (40), which bow co-operates with the 

lever formed as a roller pawl (41), the roller pawl (41) 
comprising a roller (42) which can roll over the 

circumference of the curved part (46) of the roll-over bow 
(44). 
Light liquid separator according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the roll-over bow (44) can be pressed 

against the roller (42) by means of a spring element. 
Light liquid separator according to claim 13, 
characterised in that a tension spring (48) is provided as 

the spring element. 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 12 to 
14, characterised in that a falling weight (49) is disposed 

at the linkage to augment the closing force. 
Light liquid separator according to one of claims 1 to 
15, characterised in that a locking mechanism (34, 35 or 51, 

53), which co-operates with the lever (37, 41), is provided 
for the linkage (17). 
Light liquid separator according to claim 16, 
characterised in that the locking mechanism comprises a 

holding pawl (51), which co-operates with the lever (41).
