<ABSTRACT>
In a plant (1) for utilising residue materials (2) which occur during waste glass treatment, a sieving machine (11) is provided, in which glass parts (17, 18) of different grain can be separated from the residue materials (2), and furthermore, connected upstream and/or downstream of and/or directly assigned to the sieving machine (11), one or more suction arrangements (21) and/or bar grates (36) for removing light materials (28, 29, 37). One or more devices (34, 35) for dividing and/or breaking up the remaining solid materials (33) can also be connected downstream of the sieving machine (11). With this plant (1), it is possible in a simple and economical manner to separate and consequently to reutilise the residue materials (2) occurring in the treatment of waste glass without fearing impurities. This is because the waste glass parts are separated completely from the other parts by the individual aggregates of the plant (1), and metal parts and light materials are also separated without problems.
