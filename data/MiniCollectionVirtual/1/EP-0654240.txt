<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for brewing a 
drink, such as coffee. The apparatus comprises a chamber (3) for 

accommodating a mixture of water and a ground product, such as coffee, 
to be extracted, the chamber having a perforated base (2) on which a 

strip of filter material (8) can be laid. Means (14,26) are fitted on one 
side of said base for moving the strip of filter material 

over the base after a quantity of drink has been brewed and 
has been removed via the piece of filter material. The means 

for moving the strip of filter material comprise a separate 
transport unit (14), and fixing means (28,29) are provided for fixing the 

transport unit to one of two opposing sides of the base, as 
desired. The means for moving the strip of filter material 

can also comprise a separate guide unit (26), which is fixed in 
each case to that side of the base which is opposite to the 

side where the transport unit (14) is located. A supply unit (19) for 
filter material can also be fitted at the side of the base 

where the guide unit (26) is located. A winding unit (34) for used 
filter material is optionally fitted at the side of the base 

where the transport unit (14) is located.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for brewing a
drink, such as coffee, comprising a chamber for accommodating
a mixture of water and a ground product to be extracted,
which chamber has a perforated base on which a strip of
filter material can be laid, means being provided on one side
of said base for moving the strip of filter material over the
base after a quantity of drink has been brewed and removed
via the piece of filter material and the base located beneath
it.An apparatus of this type is disclosed in NL-A-6806368.
The strip of filter material is moved after a quantity of
drink has been brewed, the extracted ground product being
carried along with said filter material. The strip and said
ground product are then collected in a container, which has
to be emptied regularly. In addition, when the strip is
moved, a new, clean piece of filter material is brought into
position on the perforated base, after which the apparatus is
ready to brew a new quantity of coffee.
A similar apparatus is disclosed in
GB-A-1 164 760.For some applications of said apparatuses it can be
desirable to fit the means for moving the strip in a
different position. This is because the position of said
transport unit also determines the position where waste is
discharged and thus has an influence on the spatial design of
the apparatus. This also applies with respect to the positior
of the guide unit by means of which the strip of filter
material is supplied and with respect to the position of the
roll of filter material.The aim of the invention is, therefore, to provide an
apparatus of the abovementioned type which in this respect is
more flexible than the known apparatuses. This aim is
achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1.Depending on the desired embodiment of the apparatus, the
transport unit can already be fitted in the correct position 
at the time of manufacture. As said transport unit can be a
standard component which is suitable for all embodiments, an
adaptation of this type has no associated additional costs.With this arrangement, a supply unit for filter
material can also be provided at the side of the base where
the guide unit is located. It is also possible for a winding
unit for used filter material to be located at the side of
the base where the transport unit is located. Said transport
unit and winding unit can also be integrated.A particularly simple and robust embodiment can be
obtained if a set of tapped holes is provided on each of two
opposing faces of the base and the transport unit and/or
gu

Apparatus for brewing a drink, such as coffee comprising a
chamber for accommodating mixture of water and a ground product to

be extracted, the chamber (3) having a perforated base (2) on which a strip of
filter material (8) can be laid, means (16) being provided on one side of said

base for moving the strip of filter material over the base after a
quantity of drink has been brewed and removed via the piece of filter

material and the base located beneath it, 
characterized in that
 the
means (16), for moving the strip of filter material comprise a separate

transport unit (14) as well as a separate guide unit (26), and in that fixing
means (28, 29, 30, 36) are provided on two opposing sides of the base (2) and for fixing

the transport unit (14) to either one of said sides as desired, and the
guide unit (26) to the other side. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein a supply unit
for filter material (19) is additionally provided at the side of

the base where the guide unit is located.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
wherein a winding unit (31) for used filter material is also
