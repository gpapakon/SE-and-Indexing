<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel oligonucleotide-polyamide conjugates preferably having a
free 3' hydroxyl moiety, and wherein the polyamide is coupled to the oligonucleotide
through its carboxyl terminus.A number of molecular biological methods involve the detection of nucleotide sequences,
or the tagging of nucleotide sequences with reporter groups. For example, the widely
utilised polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) allows many copies of a desired DNA
to be generated from only a few target molecules within a period of 1 to 2 hours and
consequently has found applications of nucleic acid detection techniques previously limited
by low sensitivity. Detection of amplified PCR products may be carried out in a number
of ways. It is most desirable to be able to detect amplification products non-radioactively,
for example, using a reporter group within the amplified nucleotide sequences.Similarly, in reactions such as nick translation, it is desirable to incorporate a labelled
nucleotide into reaction products produced by DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase for
subsequent detection of hybridisation products.WO 89/03849 is concerned with oligonucleotide-polyamide conjugates of the formula X-L-Y,
where X is the polyamide, Y is the oligonucleotide and L is a linker which forms a covalent
bond between the amino terminus of the polyamide X and the 3' phosphate group of the
oligonucleotide Y. Example 9 thereof discloses an embodiment in which the linker between X
and Y is similar to that shown in Fig 5 of the present specification, but does not specify
compounds of the present invention, as described below, in which the oligonucleotide is linked
to the carboxy terminus of the polyamide.In accordance with the present invention there is provided in one aspect a nucleotide
polyamide conjugate of the formula (I):
Nu - NUC - C ≡ C - X1 - NH - X2 - X3
where, X' is an unsubstituted or substituted C, - C10 alkylene group, in which one or more
carbons may optionally be replaced by -NH-, -O- or -S-, X2 is a bond, or an unsubstituted
or substituted C, - C20 alkylene group, in which one or more carbons may optionally be
replaced by -NH-, -O- or -S-, the optional substituents in X' or X2 selected from one or
more of: oxo, amino, thioxo, hydroxyl, mercapto, carboxyl, halogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, 
amino-lower alkyl, ester-lower alkyl, amido-lower alkyl, ether-lower alkyl, or thioether-lower
alkyl, groups, the sulfur analogues of these substituents, or the side-chain substituents
from naturally occurring amino acids, and the
