<ABSTRACT>
A device for detecting defects (2, 3) in fibrous materials (4, 22), comprises members (16, 17) for squeezing the material against a film (1), a separating member (24) downstream of the squeezing members for separating the fibrous material from the film, and an opto-electronic sensor (6) downstream of the separating member for imaging the film and defects. An image processing assembly (26, 44) is electrically connected to the output of the imaging assembly for sensing and counting the marks left on the film by the defects. A member (25) is provided for moving the film relative to the opto-electronic sensor. Various optical systems, particularly polarizers (9, 10), may be incorporated into the device.

A device for detecting defects, comprising elements 
which are optically distinctive, in fibrous materials, in 

particular such as sugar particles in cotton, comprising an 
optoelectronic sensor (6) able to supply signals which are 

representative of defects present in an optical field of the 
sensor (6), which is connected to an image-processing means 

(7,26,44) designed to analyse the signals which are 
representative of defects and to count them, characterised 

in that it comprises a transfer film (1) passing in the 
field of the optoelectronic sensor under the action of a 

transport means (25) and passing successively under a means 
(16,17) for pressing fibrous material (22) on to the 

transfer film (1) adapted to cause to adhere to the latter 

the defective elements either without fibres (2) or attached 
(3) to fibres (4), and under a means (24) for separating the 

fibrous material (22) from the film (1), as a result of 
which the latter enters the field of the sensor (6) carrying 

therewith the individual defects (2,3,4). 
A device according to claim 1, for defects (2,3,4) 
which are dispersive for at least one wavelength of 

polarised light, characterised in that, with the film (1) 
being chosen from a material which is not dispersive for 

said wavelength of polarised light, the device comprises a 
light source (5) provided with a first polariser (9) 

filtering the light emitted by the source so as to deliver 
said polarised light on to the transfer film (1) in the 

field of the sensor (6), and a second polariser (10) 
disposed on the optoelectronic sensor (6) and orientated so 

as to arrest said non-dispersed polarised light. 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that in the transport path of the film (1) 

between the pressing means (16,17) and the separating means 
(24) there is provided a heating means (18,19) which heats 

the film (1) so as to cause the defects (2,3,4) to adhere to  
 

it. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in 
which the optoelectronic sensor (6) emits a series of 

signals which are representative of transverse lines on the 
film (1) comprising a given number of points, characterised 

in that the image-processing means (26) comprises a means 
(31) for detecting a continuity of defects (2,3,4) between 

signals representative of successive lines. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the image-processing means (26) comprises means 

(27,39,40) for counting the number of points of a line 
affected by the same defect (2,3,4). 
A device according to either one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that it comprises a comparator with a 

threshold adapted to select the defects (2,3,4) as a 
function of at least one of their dimensions. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises two light sources (5,50) which are 

disposed on either side of the transfer film (1) and which 
are such that the amount of light which they emit, 

transmitted through the film (1) in the field of the 
optoelectronic sensor (6), is substantially equal in the 

absence of defects (2,3,4). 
A device according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the two light sources (5,50) are each provided with a 

respective polariser (9,51), which are arranged with their 
polarisation axes in quadrature, the optoelectronic sensor 

(6) being provided with a separator (52) for polarised light 
and two photosensitive zones (53,54), the separator (52) 

being arranged so as to transmit to the two zones (53,54) 
the polarised light parallel to the axes of the respective 

polarisers (9) and (51). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the transfer film (1) is chosen so as to absorb 

partially the light at at least one wavelength, whereas the 
optoelectronic sensor (6) is selectively sensitive at this 

wavelength.
