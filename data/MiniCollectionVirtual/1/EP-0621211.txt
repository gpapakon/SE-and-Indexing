<ABSTRACT>
A tray for confectionery items, in particular cakes, 
consists of a supporting paperboard element (2) 

exhibiting a central surface depression or hollow (3a) 
designed to receive the confectionery item to be 

supported, and a perimetric lace-like-worked edge (4). 
Associated with the lower part of the supporting element 

is a stiffening member (5) made of paperboard material 
too and consisting of two layers (5a, 5b) in which the 

fibres of one layer are transverse to those of the other 
layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tray for 
confectionery items, in particular cakes. It is known that confectionery items, such as cakes, 
when they need to be packaged or merely shown in the 
window, are disposed on support elements made of paper 
material enabling the confectionery items to be carried, 
or in any event moved, without causing any damages to 
the same. Such support elements also perform an important 
decorative function giving a pleasant appearance to the 
packaged product. Practically, these support elements for cakes 
substantially consist of a rest sheet made of paraffined 
paper adapted for food, comprising a centre area, on 
which the confectionery item is disposed, and a lace-like-worked 
annulus extending along the perimeter of 
said centre area. The lace-like-worked annulus defines a 
grasping region for the support element and at the same 
time gives the packaged product an agreeable aesthetic 
appearance. In order to stiffen the support element and therefore 
enable an easier transportation of the confectionery 
item, a paperboard disc is generally engaged in a 
removable manner to the lower part of the rest sheet, 
the sizes of said disc being the same as those of the 
centre sheet area. Although the above described support elements of known 
type are widely used in the confectionery field, they 
however have many drawbacks as regards both their 
construction costs and, above all, the possibility of 
using them in a practical and universal manner.  
 It is to be noted in fact that the manufacture of 
paraffined rest sheets is rather expensive because, in 
order to obtain a lace-like-worked edge it is necessary 
to carry out a punching operation during which, as 
known, a paperboard sheet acting as a protective and 
damping element must be disposed on the base of the 
punching machine. Such a paperboard sheet, as it 
becomes impregnated with the paraffined paper off-cuts 
coming from the punching operation carried out on the 
sheets resting thereon, practically cannot be recycled 
and therefore involves a heavy economical loss. On the 
other hand, each paperboard protection sheet cannot be 
used for more than six or seven punching operations 
because many cuts inevitably occur on said paperboard 
sheet during each punching cycle and they will give 
rise to increasingly greater inaccuracies as punchings 
continue to increase. From a practical point of view, it will be also noted 
that the rest sheet made of paraffined paper, although 
provided with a certain degree of

said supporting element (2), centre area (3) and 

stiffening member (5) are of a circular conformation. 
A tray according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said stiffening member (5) has a perimetric band (6) 

extendiong lowermost and directly in contact with said 
perimetric lace-like-worked edge (4). 
A tray according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said supporting element (2) is provided, at said centre 

area (3), with a surface depression or hollow (3a) for 
housing the confectionery item.
