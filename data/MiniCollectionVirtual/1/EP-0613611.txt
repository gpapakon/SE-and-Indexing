<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an apparatus having a capability for 
cooling even relatively small electronic or computer components. Presently used 
cooling apparatus for such equipment usually requires the cooling of entire rooms, 
spaces or cubicles in which the equipment is to be used and maintained during 
operation. Obviously, such cooling requires relatively large capacity refrigeration 
equipment wasting substantial amounts of electrical energy required to supply 
power to such equipment. The problem with such systems is the inability to direct 
and concentrate cooling at the specific components to be maintained at the reduced 
operating temperatures without cooling the surrounding area in which the 
equipment is housed. Thermoelectric spot cooling devices have limited cooling 
temperature capabilities and capacities and are relatively inefficient and typically 
incorporate heavy and/or bulky components for heat transfer. In addition, reject 
heat is difficult to remove from the area adjacent the cooling load spot. The invention is defined in Claims 1, 19, 20, 21 and 35. The present invention incorporates apparatus capable of cooling even 
relatively small components of computers or other electronic equipment, almost 
instantaneously, without wasting substantial power by cooling unnecessary 
components, equipment or even the area in which the equipment is operated. The 
apparatus and method of the present invention provide the capacity of achieving 
spot cooling by using, in one embodiment, capillary or small sized tubing to form or 
create an evaporator cooler in heat exchange contact with the specific component 
or components to be cooled. The apparatus is thus capable of providing cooling 
directly at the component to be cooled, whereby it may be maintained at any 
desired or given temperature with heat rejection performed remote from the cooling 
area. In another  
 
embodiment of the invention a cooling loop is used to cool 
individual components with a circulating liquid, gas or phase 
change process and precooling of the heat transfer medium 
performed at one or more locations interfaced with the complex 
compound system evaporator or desorber. The invention 
utilizes the benefit of complex compound technology in which 
a refrigerant ligand is alternately adsorbed and desorbed to 
and from a solid salt-based complex compound. The apparatus 
and system provides further advantage in avoiding the 
necessity of using compressors, pumps, burners, etc. thus 
simplifying the cooling equipment as
