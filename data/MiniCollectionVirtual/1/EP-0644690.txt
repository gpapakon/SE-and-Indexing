<ABSTRACT>
A station apparatus disposed in a VCR for reproducing a tape recorded by 
a camcorder through a TV set, including an engaging portion disposed in a VCR 

for receiving and supporting a camcorder, a plurality of audio/video signal 
terminals disposed at the bottom of an engaging portion of the VCR for receiving 

an output signal from the camcorder, a plurality of power terminals disposed at the 
bottom of the engaging portion of the VCR for transferring power to the 

camcorder, and audio/video cables for electrically connecting an output terminal 
with an input terminal of a TV set. 
Thus, compared to conventional camcorder stations, file present invention 
gives not only equal performance and more convenient to use for various purposes 

but also high performance can be achieved at a low price.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a camcorder station apparatus 
disposed in a VCR(Video Cassette Tape Recorder), and more particularly to a 
station apparatus capable of easily reproducing the tape recorded by the camcorder 
through the TV(Television) set without using an additionally separated station 
apparatus. Conventionally, a camcorder station apparatus, as shown in Fig. 1, includes 
a station apparatus 2 with a function of transferring an output signal of the 
camcorder 3 to a TV set 1 upon a mode selection of the camcorder 3 for 
reproducing a tape recorded by the camcorder 3; an input terminal(not shown) of 
the station apparatus 2 for receiving power from the wall outlet 4 through a cable 
5 for driving the station apparatus 2; and an input terminal 6a disposed at one side 
of the TV set for receiving the output signal from the output terminal(not shown) 
of the station apparatus through the cable 6. The operation of the conventional camcorder station apparatus will be now 
described. First, for reproducing a 8mm tape recorded by the camcorder 3 through the 
TV set, the camcorder is placed on an upper portion of the camcorder station  
 
apparatus 2, while the power and connecting terminals(not shown) disposed at the 
bottom of the camcorder 3 and the engaging portion(not shown) of the upper 
portion of the station apparatus 3 are electrically connected each other, so that it 
will be possible to watch the reproducing image through the TV set 1. At this time, 
the power supply for the station apparatus 2 is applied from the output terminal(not 
shown) of the station apparatus 2 through the wall outlet 4 and the cable 5. The 
power supply for the camcorder 3 is applied from the power terminal disposed at 
the upper portion of the station apparatus 2 through the power terminal at the 
bottom of the camcorder 3. As described above, the conventional camcorder needs an additionally 
separated station apparatus for reproducing a tape recorded by the camcorder 3, 
additionally requiring a connecting cable 6 that electrically connects the TV set 1 
and the station apparatus 2 and the cable 5 for connecting the wall outlet 4 and the 
station apparatus 2 and thus reproducing the tape recorded by the camcorder 3 is 
inconvenient for the user. The disadvantages of the conventional station apparatus lie in that the range 
of its use is limited for only reproducing the tape recorded by the camcorder 3 
despite its high price. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
