<ABSTRACT>
To make it possible to easily carry out 
registration of a mutual ID number (ID) in a slave 

telephone set in cordless telephone device by only 
operating a switch or buttons, in the cordless 

telephone device according to the present invention, a 
sound generating element (12) and a sound receiving 

element (60) located closer and opposing to each other 
when the slave telephone set is set on a cradle of the 

master telephone set are provided in the master 
telephone set and the slave telephone set respectively, 

and ID signal sound is transferred between the two 
elements (12), (60), so that even an ordinary user can 

carry out the ID registration requiring very 
complicated operations in the conventional technology 

without fail.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cordless 
telephone device in which call between a master 
telephone set and a slave telephone set is supported 
only when a mutual ID number stored in the master 
telephone set coincides with that stored in the slave 
telephone set, and more particularly to an improved 
type of cordless telephone device in which registration 
of a mutual ID number can easily be carried out by 
transferring a mutual ID number stored in a master 
telephone set to a slave telephone set to be stored 
therein. In this type of cordless telephone device, a 
control circuit is provided so that call is supported, 
only when a mutual ID number stored in a master 
telephone set connected to a telephone line coincides 
with that stored in or more slave telephone sets 
connected with the master telephone set by radio 
communication, between the master telephone set and the 
one or more slave telephone sets. However, in this type of cordless telephone 
device based on the conventional technology, when a 
slave telephone set must be replaced for maintenance, 
it is necessary to carry out a very complicated work  
 
for exchanging a memory (or rewriting a content of 
memory) in which mutual ID numbers are stored by 
opening or closing a cabinet for the slave telephone 
set, and also when a new slave telephone set which can 
communicate with the master telephone set is extended, 
it is necessary to carry out a very complicated work 
for transferring the mutual ID numbers stored in the 
master telephone set to the new slave telephone set to 
be stored therein by opening or closing a cabinet for 
the slave or mater telephone set, and in either case 
the telephone set must be taken to a dealer or a 
service man must be called for that purpose, which is 
very troublesome. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved type of cordless telephone device 
in which registration of a mutual ID number in a slave 
telephone set can easily be carried out without fail by 
only operating a switch or buttons without opening or 
closing a cabinet for the salve telephone set not for 
the master telephone set. Namely in the cordless telephone device 
according to the present invention comprising a master 
telephone set connected to a wire telephone line and a 
slave telephone set mounted on a cradle of the master 
telephone set to be electrically charged and connected 
to the master telephone set through a radio system and  
 
having a ID number memory means for storing mutual ID 
numbers in the

<CLAIMS>
A cordless telephone device comprising a 
master telephone set connected to a telephone line and 

a slave telephone set mounted on a cradle of said 
master telephone set to be electrically charged and 

connected to said master telephone set through a radio 
system during call, and having memory means for storing 

mutual ID numbers in said master telephone set and said 
slave telephone set respectively; wherein said cradle 

of said master telephone set has a sound generating 
means, said slave telephone set has a sound receiving 

means getting closer and opposing to said sound 
generating means when said slave telephone set is set 

on said cradle, and a mutual ID number read out from 
said memory means of said master telephone set is 

written via said sound generating means and said sound 
receiving means located adjacent and opposing to each 

other in said memory means of said slave telephone set 
for registration of said mutual ID number in said slave 

telephone set. 
A cordless telephone device according to 
claim 1, wherein a microphone conventionally used for 

ordinary call is also used as said sound receiving 
element to be incorporated in said slave telephone set. 
A cordless telephone device according to 
claim 1, wherein a sound generating element 

 
conventionally used for generating bell sound, or a 

speaker for intercom or for speaker phone is also used 
as said sound generating element to be incorporated in 

said cradle of said master telephone set. 
A cordless telephone device according to 
claim 2, wherein a sound generating element 

conventionally used for generating bell sound, or a 
speaker for intercom or for speaker phone is also used 

as said sound generating element to be incorporated in 
said cradle of said master telephone set. 
A cordless telephone device according to 
claim 1, whe
rein two sound waves each having a 
different tone frequency are switched to be used as 

sound indicating said mutual ID number transmitted 
between said sound generating means and said sound 

receiving means and tone frequencies of two sound waves 
conventionally used for radio data communications 

between a master telephone set and a slave telephone 
set are used as tone frequencies of said two sound 

waves. 
A cordless telephone device according to 
claim 2, wherein two sound waves each having a 

different tone frequency are switched to be used as 
sound indicating said mutual ID number transmitted 

between said sound generating means and said sound 
 

receiving means and tone frequencies of two sound waves 
conventionally used for radio data communications 

between a master telephone set and a slave telephone 
set are used as tone frequencies of said two sound 

waves. 
A cordless telephone device according to 
claim 3, wherein two sound waves each having a 

different tone frequency are switched to be used as 
sound indicating said mutual ID number transmitted 

between said sound generating means and said sound 
receiving means and tone frequencies of two sound waves 

conventionally used for radio data communications 
between a master telephone set and a slave telephone 

set are used as tone frequencies of said two sound 
waves.
