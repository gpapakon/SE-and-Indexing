<DESCRIPTION>
 A Detergent CompositionTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to detergent compositions comprising anionic mid- branched surfactant compounds and additional anionic sulfate and sulfonate surfactants. The compositions are particularly useful as solid laundry detergent compositions.Background to the InventionRecently, a certain new type of anionic mid-chain branched surfactants has been developed. These surfactants are described in unpublished co-pending applications US 97/06485, US 97/06474, US 97/06339, US 97/06476 and US 97/06338.It has been determined that these mid-chain branched surfactants are excellent surfactants, in particular for use in laundry products, especially under cool or cold water washing conditions even as low as 20°C-5°C. It has also been found that combination of two or more of these mid-chain branched surfactants can provide a surfactant mixture that is even higher in surfactancy and has better low temperature water solubility.Surprisingly, it has now been found that detergent compositions comprising these mid-chain branched surfactants and an additional sulphate and sulphonate surfactant, present in specific ratios, has an improved cleaning performance, in particular of greasy stains and soils. It has been found that lower levels of the additional anionic sulfate and sulfonate surfactants, which are traditionally known and used in detergent formulations, can still have excellent cleaning performance when combined with the mid-chain branched anionic surfactants. An additional benefit of such a combination can be that it allows the reduction of the levels of (or even the elimination of) other surfactants which are traditionally employed in detergents, such as nonionic surfactants, whilst still achieving an excellent cleaning performance. Thus, the inclusion of the specific mid-chain branched surfactants in 

detergent compositions comprising anionic sulfate and sulfonate surfactants, allows an overall reduction of the levels and types of surfactants needed, to obtain excellent cleaning performance. Another additional benefit is that hereby the formulation costs can be reduced and the ease of formulation can be improved.All documents cited are hereby incorporate herein by reference.Summary of the InventionThe invention relates to detergent compositions, preferably being solid laundry detergent compositions, comprisinga) at least 0.5%, preferably at least 5%, more preferably at least 10% by weight of the composition a surfactant system, comprising one or more longer alkyl
