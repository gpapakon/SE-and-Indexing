<ABSTRACT>
A perimeter independent precision locating member 
(22) for a semiconductor chip (10) for ensuring that contact sites (20) 

upon the chip will be reliably positioned relative to 
connection members (18), such as contacts or leads, so 

that the chip can be electrically engageable. The 
locating member (22) is disposed upon the surface of the 

semiconductor chip (10) at a specific position relative 
the contact sites within the perimeter (24) of the chip 

and being closely matable with a complementary portion 
of a housing (12) that contains the connection members (18). 

The method of making the perimeter independent precision 
locating member (22) for a semiconductor chip (10) 

involves coating the chip with a layer of photocurable 
material, masking the material in relation to the 

contact sites so that the portion of the material that 
will become the locating member (22) is exposed, 

illuminating the exposed portion of the photocurable 
material, and stripping from the chip the uncured 

portion to define the locating member (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the positioning of 
contact sites of a semiconductor chip to their 
respective connection members in order to assure 
electrical connection with the semiconductor chip. Semiconductor chips, or chip(s), provide complex 
electrical functions in small packages and are 
fabricated as part of a larger semiconductor wafer. The 
individual semiconductor chips are separated from the 
semiconductor wafer by an operation called "dicing" 
where the chip is cut along what becomes its peripheral 
edge. The chips are most familiar in electronic 
applications, such as microprocessors, but may also be 
useful as electro-optic devices, for example lasers and 
light emitting diodes. The semiconductor wafers are processed through 
conventional techniques of etching, diffusing and doping 
to produce the desired functions of the individual 
chips. Each individual chip has a plurality of contact 
sites exposed along a major surface of the chip that 
will become engaged by connection members of another 
electrical article, such as leads or contacts in a 
socket, to form electrical connections with the chip. 
The connection members are prepositioned in the article 
in an arrangement that corresponds to the contact sites 
of the chip and then the chip must be positioned so that 
the contact sites and the connection members correspond 
during its assembly to the article. If the contact sites are large relative to the 
connection members, there is sufficient positioning 
tolerance available so that the peripheral edges of the 
chip may be utilized to position the chip. One way of 
doing so is to create a recess that is located relative 
to the connection members, so that when the chip is 
within the recess in the article the contact sites align 
with the connection members. If the periphery of the  
 
chip produced during dicing is undersized, the chip may 
float within the recess. The greater the dimensional 
discrepancy, the greater the float, possibly enough so 
that proper electrical connection may not be reliably 
established. Another way of aligning the chip within a recess is 
described in U.S. Patent Application No. 08/092,149 
filed on July 15, 1993. The recess has two adjacent 
spring sides which bias the chip against opposite sides 
that are precisely located relative to the connection 
members. This configuration accommodates variations in 
the size of the chip while preventing the chip from 
floating. However, when the periphery of the chip is 
formed during dicing operation, the edges may
