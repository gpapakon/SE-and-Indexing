<ABSTRACT>
A connector (10) for connecting electrical conductor areas of flexible
circuits (22,23) with associated conductor pads (51) of an edge connector portion of a circuit

board (51), comprising a connector housing (12,14) having a circuit board opening (16) sized to at
least partially accommodate the edge connector portion, and a further opening

allowing passage of the flexible circuits into an interior cavity of the connector
housing. A first spring (20) and second spring (30) each have a resilient arched feature (28,38) for

supporting one of the flexible circuits (23,33) to resiliently bias an electrical conductor
area of the associated flexible circuit into electrical contact with associated

conductor pads (51) when the connector engages the edge connector portion. The
electrical conductor areas (25,35) of the flexible circuits face each other. At least one of

the springs is bent so as to have a first L shaped portion (26) and a second L shaped
portion (29) at an end thereof, with the second L shaped portion (29) being oriented

approximately 90 degrees offset to the first L shaped portion (26), and one end of the
first L shaped portion (26) contacting one end of the second L shaped portion (29). The

springs (20,30) resiliently urge the flexible circuits (23,33) to provide electrical contact with the
conductor pads (51) of the edge connector portion when the connector is attached at a

desired location to the circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to electrical connectors.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a structure for releasably
connecting contacts of a circuit to conductive pads on a printed circuit board.In electrical arts, it is a common practice to use a connector to
mechanically and electrically couple one printed circuit board (PCB) to another
PCB. In such a practice, there has been an evolution towards placing electrical
contacts closer and closer together while maintaining a high, constant stress
between the electrical contact and the areas to be contacted. In electrical systems,
flexible printed circuits are employed as electrical jumpers or cables for
interconnecting rows of terminal pins or pads of printed circuit boards (PCBs). A
connector, mounted to one or both ends of the jumper, is formed with a set of
electrical receptacles or sockets which is designed to receive the terminal posts or
contact the pads on the PCB. A primary focus of manufacturers is to increase
the circuit density associated with interconnecting the sub-assemblies and
components found within their products. This leads to higher density modules,
each requiring multiple interconnections to other modules. However, major
problems with connectors having closely spaced contacts include the problems of
cross-talk, lack of controlled impedance, and increased inductance.Although the art of connectors is well developed, there remain some
problems inherent in this technology, particularly connectors having closely 
spaced contacts include the problems of cross-talk, lack of controlled impedance,
and increased inductance. Therefore, a need exists for a connector structure and
assembly that reduces cross-talk, controls impedance, and reduces inductance as
connector density increases.The present invention provides a structure for releasably connecting
contacts of a circuit to conductive pads on a circuit board that reduces cross-talk,
controls impedance, and reduces inductance as connector density increases.The present invention is directed to a connector for connecting
respective electrical conductor areas of a plurality of flexible circuits with
associated conductor pads of an edge connector portion of a circuit board,
comprising: a connector housing having a circuit board opening sized to at least
partially accommodate the edge connector portion, and a further opening allowing
passage of the flexible circuits into an interior cavity of the connector housing; a
first spring having a resilient arched feature for
