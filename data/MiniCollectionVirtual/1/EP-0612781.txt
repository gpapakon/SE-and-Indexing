<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an epoxy-terminated
polyamide and an adhesive made therefrom. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an epoxy-terminated
polyamide, an adhesive made from it, and to
methods for producing them. The epoxy-terminated polyamide
of the present invention is suited for an amide component
and well compatible with an epoxy resin in the production of
an epoxy/polyamide adhesive which is excellent in
adhesiveness and thermal resistant property and which is
usefully available for substrates of flexible printed wiring
boards mounting a variety of electric and electronic parts.Conventionally, an epoxy-polyamide (nylon) type is
well known for an adhesive which is excellent in adhesion
and thermal resistant property and which is widely made
available for a variety of substrates including flexible
wiring boards.On the other hand, from the viewpoint of excessive
hygroscopic property and insufficient thermal resistant
property, use of a large amount of a polyamide resin
against an epoxy resin is not recommended. Generally, a
polyamide resin is not well compatible with an epoxy resin.Therefore, a blend containing a large amount of an epoxy 
resin often results in poor uniformity in dried
conditions, thus, this degrades reliability on the
adhesiveness and obstructs to stabilize product quality.Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a
novel epoxy-terminated polyamide which is well compatible
with an epoxy resin and excellent in thermal resistant
property, and also provides a method for producing it.Another object of the invention is to provide a novel
adhesive which is excellent in thermal resistant property
and adhesiveness, and also provides a method for producing
it.To solve those problems mentioned above and to
enhance freedom of blending a variety of epoxy resins and
polyamide resins, inventors have made an extensive study to
improve compatibility of polyamide resins with epoxy resins.
They finally found out that those technical problems
mentioned above could be solved by epoxy-terminated
polyamides having a specific structure.The first aspect of the present invention is to
provide a novel epoxy-terminated polyamide having the
following structure: 
 
where each of R1, R2, and R3 is a divalent organic group,
each of n and m is a natural number of at least 1.The second aspect of the present invention is to
provide a method for producing a novel epoxy-terminated
polyamide characterized by reacting an epoxy resin with the
carboxylic acid-terminated polyamide.The
