<ABSTRACT>
A line printing system which utilizes an array (80) of asymmetrical Fabry-Perot light
valves (C
1
,C
2
 etc) for simultaneously transferring all pixel information of one raster line onto a
photoreceptor (88). The number of elements of the light valve array used in this invention is

equal to the number of pixels on a raster line. The pixel information is applied to elements of the
light valve array in a parallel format with information representing each pixel applied to one

elemental light valve of the array. The array is illuminated by a wedge-shaped incident light beam
(64) forming a focussed line image. Depending on the information state of each pixel, each

corresponding element will be activated to absorb incident light or left in its neutral state to
reflect the light. Light reflected by neutral elements (C
2
,C
5
) will be directed onto the
photoreceptor. In this fashion, the photoreceptor simultaneously receives the pixel information

for the entire raster line. In another mode, the elements will be activated to reflect the light beam
and will be left in their neutral state to absorb the light beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical system, and more particularly, to a line printing
system which is capable of simultaneously transferring all pixel information of one raster line or
one text line through use of an array of light valves.It has been shown that an electro-optic element having a plurality of individually
addressable electrodes can be used as a multi-gate light valve for line printing. See, for example,
U.S. Pat. No. 4,281,904 on a "TIR Electro-Optic Modulator with Individually Addressed Electrodes"
and U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,659 on an "Electro-Optic Line Printer". Also, see "Light Gates Give Data
Recorder Improved Hard Copy Resolution," Electronic Design, July 19, 1979, pp. 31-32; "Polarizing
Filters Plot Analog Waveforms," Machine design, Vol. 51, No. 17, July 26, 1779, p. 62; and " Data
Recorder Eliminates Problem of Linearity," Design News, February 4, 1980, pp. 56-57.Almost any optically transparent electro-optic material can be used as the electro-optic
element of a light valve such as LiNbO3, BSN, KDP, KDxP, Ba2NaNb5O15 and PLZT. The
electrodes of such a light valve are coupled to the electro-optic element and are distributed in
non-overlapping relationship widthwise of the electro-optic element (i.e. orthogonally relative to
its optical axis), typically on equidistantly separated centers so that there is a generally uniform
inter-electrode gap spacing.To perform line printing with a multi-gate light valve of the foregoing type, a
photosensitive recording medium, such as a xerographic photoreceptor, is exposed in an image
configuration as it advances in a cross line direction relative to the light valve. More particularly,
to carry out the exposure process, a sheet -like collimated light beam is transmitted through the
electro-optic element of the light valve, either along its optical axis for straight through
transmission or at a slight angle relative to that axis for total internal reflection. Furthermore,
successive sets of pixel information are sequentially applied to the electrodes.In the case of straight through transmission, a light valve is positioned between two
polarizing filters, the axis of one filter oriented at 90 degrees with respect to the other to totally
block the passage of light. An unpolarized collimated light beam will be polarized linearly by the
first filter, along the horizontal axis. When the gates are not activated, the polarized light is
blocked by the second filter. However, the activated light gate rotates the plane of polarization
of light 90 degrees so
