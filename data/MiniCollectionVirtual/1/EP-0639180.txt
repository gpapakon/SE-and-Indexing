<ABSTRACT>
A process for stereospecifically hydrolysing a mixture of the (+) and (-) isomers of a compound of formula (II), in which R is C1-6 alkyl; using a carboxyl esterase enzyme, (i) to form a compound of formula (IIIA), and thereafter separating the resulting compound of formula (IIIA) from the remaining (-) isomer of formula (II); or (ii) to form a compound of formula (IIIB) and thereafter separating the resulting compound of formula (IIIB) from the remaining (+) isomer of formula (II).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a new process and certain novel
intermediates.US Patent No. 4,007,196 describes a class of compounds which possess anti-depressant
activity. One specific compound mentioned in the patent is paroxetine
which is described as possessing anti-depressant activity.
This compound has now been approved for human use in some countries and
is being sold as an anti-depressant agent.All described processes for preparing paroxetine involve chemical reactions
such as those described in US Patent 4902801. It will be appreciated that paroxetine
is actually the (-) isomer (as shown above) and that all chemical methods of preparing
paroxetine involve a chemical resolution step which wastes substrate and reactants
and necessitates the use of expensive resolving agents and is a fairly expensive
reaction to perform.The present invention involves the use of an enzymatic resolution step which
allieviates or overcomes a number of problems associated with a purely chemical
resolution step.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for stereospecifically
hydrolysing a mixture of the (+) and (-) isomers of a compound of formula (II):

in which R is C1-6 alkyl; using a carboxyl esterase enzyme, 
(i) to form a compound of formula (IIIA),

and thereafter separating the resulting compound of formula (IIIA) from the
remaining (-) isomer of formula (II); orii) to form a compound of formula (IIIB):

and thereafter separating the resulting compound of formula (IIIB) from the
remaining (+) isomer of formula (II).It should be appreciated that the choice of carboxy esterase enzyme will
determine which isomer of formula (II) is hydrolysed to the corresponding acid,
which may be determined by routine experimentation.Process variant i) is preferred.When using process variant (i) the stereoselectivity of the process is such that
from a racemic mixture of a compound of formula (II), after the action of the
carboxyl esterase enzyme the ratio of (-) to (+) isomer of formula (II), is greater than
60%, preferably greater than 70%, more preferably greater than 80% and most
preferably greater than 85%.When using process variant (ii) the stereoselectivity of the process is such that
from a racemic mixture of a compound of formula (II), after the action of the carboxy
esterone enzyme, the ratio of (+) to (-) isomer of a compound of formula (II), is
greater than 60%, preferably greater than 70%, more preferably greater than 80% and 
most preferably greater than 85%.The process is suitably carried out by

compound of formula (II), as defined in claim 1, using conventional esterification

techniques followed by subsequent convertion to paroxetine or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof.
A process for subsequently converting a (-) compound of formula
(III) directly to paroxetine by reducing the carboxylic acid group to a

hydroxymethyl group and reducing the two keto groups in the piperidine ring and
subsequently, converting the resulting piperidine carbinol to paroxetine or a

pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof.
