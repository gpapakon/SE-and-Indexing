<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a
semiconductor device having a crystalline semiconductor. The present
invention further relates to an electro-optical device such as an active
matrix liquid crystal device using the semiconductor device.Thin film transistors (referred to simply hereinafter as "TFTs") are well
known and are widely used in various types of integrated circuits or an
electro-optical device, and particularly used for switching elements
provided to each of pixels of an active matrix(-addressed) liquid crystal
display device as well as in driver elements of the peripheral circuits
thereof.An amorphous silicon film can be utilized most readily as the thin film
semiconductor for a TFT. However, the electric characteristics of the
amorphous silicon film are disadvantageously poor. The use of a thin film of
polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon), which is a crystalline silicon, can solve
the problem. Crystalline silicon is denoted as, for example, polycrystalline
silicon, polysilicon, and microcrystalline silicon. The crystalline silicon film
can be prepared by first forming an amorphous silicon film, and then heat
treating the resulting film for crystallization.The heat treatment for the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film
requires heating the film at a temperature of 600 °C or higher for a duration
of 10 hours or longer. Such a heat treatment is detrimental for a glass
substrate. For instance, a Corning 7059 glass commonly used for the
substrate of active matrix liquid crystal display devices has a glass 
distortion point of 593 °C, and is therefore not suitable for large area
substrates that are subjected to heating at a temperature of 600 °C or
higher.According to the study of the present inventors, it was found that the
crystallization of an amorphous silicon film can be effected by heating the
film at 550 °C for a duration of about 4 hours. This can be accomplished by
disposing a trace amount of nickel or palladium, or other elements such as
lead, onto the surface of the amorphous silicon film. Such a method is
known from US-A-5,147,826.The elements above (hereinafter referred to as "catalyst elements
capable of accelerating the crystallization of an amorphous silicon film" or
simply as "catalyst elements") can be introduced into the surface of the
amorphous silicon film by depositing the elements by plasma treatment or
vapor deposition, or by incorporating the elements by ion implantation. The
plasma treatment more specifically comprises adding the
