<ABSTRACT>
Blind with a powered rolling mechanism for curved windows, comprising a bracket (1, 2) for a rolling member (3), a blind fabric (4)secured at one end to the rolling member and at the other end to a drawing rod (5), means for deploying and returning the fabric (4) including two links each articulated by an end to the drawing rod (5), the other end being articulated to a runner (7, 8) sliding along a rail (6) integral with the bracket (1, 2), substantially parallel to the rolling axis of the fabric (4) and a device for driving the runners (7, 8) simultaneously and in opposite directions (7, 8) along the rail (6). The drawing rod (5) is elastically deformable perpendicular to the blind fabric (4). Each link comprises a base (12, 13) articulated to the corresponding runner (7, 8) which comprises a pivot pin (16, 17) about which is mounted the connecting rod body (18, 19) to rotate about its longitudinal axis in relation to the base (12, 13). The main body (18, 19) comprises a radial stop surface (24, 25) for engaging with a stop surface (28, 29) carried by the runner (7, 8) during the last part of the depolyment travel of the runner (7, 8) and for pivotingly driving the body (18, 19) about the pivot pin (16, 17) during this part of the travel.
