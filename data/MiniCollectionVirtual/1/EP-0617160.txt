<ABSTRACT>
An improved covered or coupled fabric particularly for 
coverings, tensile structures, trucks, inflatable products 

in general, air conveyance, water containment, including a 
support (10) made of fabric which is spread with, or 

coupled to, a compact or non-compact elastomer or plastomer 
compound (11,12); in one or more regions the support is 

parted by dividing the weft and/or warp threads into two 
independently-woven groups (10a,10b), forming tubular 

elements (13) for the insertion of straps or other flexible 
or rigid elements, or for inflation or filling with water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved covered or 
coupled fabric particularly useful for coverings, tensile 
structures, tent-like structures, trucks, inflatable 
products in general (such as dinghies, rescue rafts, lifting 
balloons, etc.), air conveyance (such as pipes, mines, 
etc.), and water containment (such as tanks, etc.). Heavy-duty fabrics spread with plastic and non-plastic 
materials are extensively used in the technology of 
manufacturing large coverings. This is the case in the construction of tent-like 
structures and tensile structures, pressure domes, truck 
body coverings and of other kinds of similar coverings. For some kinds of coverings, in particular for those of 
truck bodies, the covered fabric is used in combination with 
straps, cables or other flexible elements which pass through 
regions thereof. In these cases, in order to keep the straps in position 
so that they can best perform their functions, bands of 
fabric are applied onto the fabric for coverings and are 
laterally welded to form pockets through which the straps 
are then passed, or the straps are welded or stitched 
directly onto the fabric. This entails an enormous amount of work. Furthermore, strength is not optimum in the regions 
where the applied fabrics and the main support join. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
eliminate the drawbacks described above in known types of 
fabrics for coverings and to considerably simplify  
 
manufacture thereof. A further aim of the invention is to provide a covered 
or coupled fabric with tubular regions having high 
mechanical strength. Another aim is to provide a covered or coupled fabric 
which can be manufactured with conventional equipment and 
facilities. With these and other aims in view, there is provided, 
according to the present invention, an improved covered or 
coupled fabric comprising a support made of fabric spread 
with an elastomer or plastomer or foamed compound, 
characterized in that in one or more regions said support is 
parted by dividing the weft and/or warp threads into two 
independently-woven groups, forming tubes for the insertion 
of straps or other flexible or rigid elements, or for 
inflation or filling with liquids. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of a preferred embodiment thereof, illustrated 
only by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying 
drawings, wherein:

<CLAIMS>
Improved covered or coupled fabric particularly for 
coverings, tensile structures, tent-like structures, trucks, 

inflatable products in general, air conveyance, and water 
containment, comprising a support (10) made of fabric 

spread with, or coupled to, foamed or non-foamed elastomers 
or plastomers (11,12), characterized in that one or more 

regions of said support is parted by dividing the weft 
and/or warp threads into two independently-woven groups 

(10a,10b), forming tubular elements (13) or a single tube. 
Fabric according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said support (10) is made of polyester or polyamide or 

polypropylene or equivalent materials. 
Fabric according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said spreading or coupling 

(11,12) is provided by means of foamed or non-foamed 
elastomers or plastomers. 
Fabric according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each of said independently-woven 

groups (10a,10b) forming said tubular elements (12) is 
spread or coupled on a single outer face.
