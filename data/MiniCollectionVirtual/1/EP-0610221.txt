<CLAIMS>
Coil for an electromagnetic relay having a coil 
former (1; 11) which forms a coil tube (2; 12), whose 

basic shape is cylindrical, as a support for a winding 
stack (5; 15) as well as two flanges (3, 4; 13, 14) as 

axial boundaries of the winding space in each case, 
characterized in that at least one projection (8; 19), 

which engages in the winding stack, is constructed on the 
external circumference of the coil tube (2; 12). 
Coil according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a plurality of tab-shaped projections (8) are distributed 

over the circumference of the coil tube (2) in a common 
radial plane. 
Coil according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the external circumference of the coil tube (12) has at 

least one flat (18), a bead (19) projecting from the flat 
as a projection. 
Coil according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the bead (19) is constructed as a continuation of the 

circular cross-section of the coil tube circumference. 
Coil according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the projection or the projections (8; 19) 

are in each case arranged in the vicinity of that flange 
(3; 13) to which the winding start (6; 16) is attached.
