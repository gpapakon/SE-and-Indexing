<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a novel infectious 
bronchitis virus (IBV) serotype and to attenuated IBV 

strains derived therefrom, and also to live or 
inactivated vaccines made using such IB virus. This 

invention also relates to a method for protecting 
poultry against IBV using these vaccines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new infectious
bronchitis virus strain belonging to a new serotype, to attenuated infectious
bronchitis virus strains derived from this new
strain and to a live vaccine, for use in immunizing
poultry, which vaccine contains the attenuated strain
of infectious bronchitis virus. The invention also
relates to an inactivated vaccine containing either
the new strain which has been inactivated, or an
inactivated attenuated strain derived therefrom. The
invention is also concerned with a process for the
preparation of live infectious bronchitis vaccines.Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of
the genus coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. The
virus is usually about 80-100 nm in size, being round
with projecting 20 nm spikes. IBV is the causative
agent of an acute, highly contagious disease in
chickens of all ages, affecting the respiratory,
reproductive and renal systems.IBV has been reported in all countries where an
intensive poultry industry has been developed. Young
chickens up to 4 weeks of age are most susceptible to
respiratory disease, infection leading to high rates
of morbidity and to mortality resulting from secondary
bacterial infection. Infection in layers results in a
drop in egg production, or failure to lay at full
potential, together with an increase in the number of
down-graded eggs with thin, misshapen, rough and soft-shells
produced. Although layers usually recover from
the disease, their egg production rarely returns to
pre-infection levels. Thus infection of flocks of
chickens with IBV can have a serious economic effect. Spackman and Cameron (Veterinary Record, (1983),
113, 354-355.) isolated IBV from pheasants with a
history of respiratory signs and aberrant egg
production. This disease problem in pheasants was
successfully controlled by the use of oil-based
inactivated IBV vaccine. Thus the term poultry, as
used herein, is intended to embrace chickens,
pheasants and any other domesticated bird serving as a
source of eggs or meat and that are susceptible to
infection by IBV.Initially, most of the virulent IBV strains
isolated were of the Masachussetts serotype, and for
many years this was thought to be the only serotype of
IBV. However, it is now known that different serotypes
appear to be present in distinct geographical areas;
for example, Arkansas 99 (Johnson et al.,Avian Dis.,
(1973), 17, 518-523) has been isolated in the USA,
whilst D274 serotype (Davelaar et al., Proc. World Vet.Poultry Assoc., Oslo, 1981, p.44) has not been isolated
