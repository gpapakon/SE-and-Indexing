<ABSTRACT>
Mechanical seal, the slip ring of which is made up of an inner ring (1), which forms the sliding sealing surface, and of an outer ring (3) made from an elastically deformable material such as steel, which is clamped onto the cylindrical circumferential surface of the said inner ring and is connected rigidly, in terms of, rotation by friction. Projections and/or recesses (4) are provided on the outer ring (3) for interaction with drivers (5). In order to achieve sufficient frictional engagement between the outer ring (3) and the inner ring (1), the projections (5) or recesses are designed in such a way that the force exerted on them in the circumferential direction by the respectively associated drivers is converted into radial force exerted additionally on the circumference of the inner ring (1). For this purpose, it is possible to employ, for example, the principle of the inclined plane or a lever action.

<CLAIMS>
A slip ring for a mechanical seal, the said slip
ring being made up of an inner ring (1), which forms the

sliding seal face, and an outer ring (3, 3') of elastically
deformable material, such as steel, which is clamped on the

circumferential surface (2) of the inner ring and is
connected to it in a rotationally fixed position by

friction, the said outer ring having projections (4, 8, 8')
and/or recesses for interaction with drivers (5),

characterized in that the projections (4, 8, 8') or recesses
of the outer ring are designed in such a way that the force

exerted on them in the circumferential direction by the
respectively associated driver (5) is converted into a

radial force additionally exerted on the circumference of
the inner ring (1).
A mechanical seal according to claim 1,
characterized in that the projections (4) or recesses and

the respectively associated driver (5) interact via a
surface (6) which extends obliquely to the tangential

direction.
A mechanical seal according to claim 2,
characterized in that the oblique surface (6) is arranged on

the outer ring (3).
A mechanical seal according to claim 3,
characterized in that the outer ring (3) is formed by a

flexible metal band which in the region of each projection
(4) has a bent-out feature which extends away from the

circumference (2) of the inner ring (1) and forms the
oblique surface (6) on at least one flank. 
A mechanical seal according to claim 1,
characterized in that the projection (8, 8') forms the first

arm of the lever which is connected pivotally to the outer
ring (3') and the second arm of which exerts a radial force

on the circumference of the inner ring when subjected to a
driver force acting on the first arm.
A mechanical seal according to claim 5,
characterized in that the projection (8, 8') forms a

connecting member between two sections (3') of the outer
ring, and a driver force exerted on it tends to tilt it in

such a way as to shorten its connection length.
