<ABSTRACT>
A microkeratome and related surgical methods for performing lamellar keratotomies are provided. The microkeratome includes a guide ring assembly for placement on the eyeball, or ocular globe such that the globe's cornea protrudes therethrough. Means are provided for temporarily fixing the guide ring to the ocular globe, immobilizing the eyeball relative to the instrument. A cutting blade suitable for corneal resections is carried in a cutting head over the guide ring through a cutting path defined by the guide ring. An adjustable float head, also generally known as a plaque, is connected to the cutting head for at least partially compressing the cornea ahead of the blade, so as to set the desired thickness of the corneal resection. Means are further provided for driving the cutting head and float heat across the guide ring, whereby the blade cuts at least partially through the cornea to perform the lamellar keratotomy. Various surgical corrections are obtainable through the use of arcuate and oblique plaques, as an alternative to planar plaques or float heads, where appropriate.

 KICKOXSSλΦOKEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of provisional application Serial No. 60/056,775, filedAugust 25, 1997 and U.S. application Serial N . 08/772,698, filed December 23, 1996.1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to medical instruments and jnethods for performing eye surgery to correct irregularities of the cornea. More particularly, the present invention relates to mechanical instruments known as microkeratomes, and related surgical methods for performing lamellar keratotomies.2. The Related ArtThe first microkeratome for performing corneal resections was developed in 1962 by one of the present inventors, Doctor Jose I. Barraquer, and is shown generally in FIG. PI. This microkeratome includes a guide ring which is fixed to an ocular globe, or eyeball, with the aid of a partial vacuum applied through the ring. The guide ring immobilizes the ocular globe, maintains the tension of the globe, and regulates the diameter of the corneal resection. A portion of the microkeratome called a cutting head is supported within a channel in the guide ring for guided linear movement of the microkeratome across the ring by the surgeon. The cutting head carries a cutting blade that is oscillated by a motor-driven eccentric transverse the channel as the instrument is moved through the cutting path defined by the channel. The cutting head carries a removable, lower planar member that compresses the ocular globe ahead of the oscillating blade, to permit the blade to cut a lamella having a lower surface that is parallel to the surface of the cornea that is compressed by the planar member. The planar member is interchangeable with similar planar members of differing thicknesses, so as to vary the thickness of the resectioned corneal "disk." 

 Numerous variations on the Barraquer microkeratome have been made since 1962, including the apparatus that is the subject of U.S. Patent No. 4,662,370 assigned to Carl- Zeiεε-Stiftung of Germany. The '370 patent describes a microkeratome having interchangeable inserts with convex, concave, and planar surfaces that engage εind compress the cornea for producing a corneal resection of predetermined form and curvature. The inserts are set within a stationary planar member that is fixed to the guide ring. The cutting blade is moved through a cutting path parallel to the planar member defined by a gap between the planar member and the guide ring, and oscillates transverse the path.While apparently effective to permit resections
