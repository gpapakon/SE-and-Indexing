<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a combination wheel jack and 
trolley for use in removing and fitting wheels (10) to 

vehicles, especially heavy vehicles. The wheel jack 
and trolley has a cradle (11) which is designed to restrain 

a wheel (10) positioned therein, rollers (12,13,14) located on the 
cradle (11) to enable said wheel (10) to be rotatable, a frame to 

hold the frame and wheel at a desired altitude, and a 
means (16) to raise the wheel and cradle above the ground or 

substrate. The wheel jack and trolley also has trolley 
wheels (15) which enable the arrangement to be easily 

movable.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a combination wheel jack 
and trolley which facilitates the removal and 
fitting of wheels to vehicles, particularly heavy 
vehicles. Vehicle wheels are usually removed and fitted by 
hand once the vehicle has been jacked up. When  
 
changing wheels of light vehicles such as motor 
cars, this usually presents no difficulties for the 
wheels are relatively light and can be manhandled. When changing the wheels of heavy vehicles such as 
large trucks, off-road tractors, earth moving 
vehicles and the like, the weight of the wheels 
presents considerable difficulties. To overcome 
these difficulties which include the relatively 
precise orientation of the wheel in relation to the 
wheel hub, mechanical assistance in the form of 
fork-lift trucks or other mechanical lifting 
contrivances are employed. Because such methods 
are often improvised, they tend to be time 
consuming and also present a danger to workers 
changing the wheel. The term "wheel" as used in this specification and 
in its claims is intended to refer to a combination 
of a vehicle tyre and its rim and should not be 
confused with the term "trolley wheel" which is 
intended to refer to a wheel suitable for use with 
a trolley. In addition the term "wheel-nut" is 
intended to refer to an element of attachment  
 
between a wheel rim and its hub which may be a 
brake drum, and includes wheel-studs or bolts which 
are frequently used for this purpose. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
combination wheel jack and trolley which 
facilitates the removal and fitting of wheels to 
vehicles, particularly heavy vehicles. In accordance with this invention there is provided 
a combination wheel jack and trolley comprising a 
cradle designed to restrain a wheel, a plurality of 
rollers attached to the cradle to allow a wheel 
restrained within the cradle to be rotated in use, 
adjustment means enabling the cradle to restrain 
wheels of different sizes, a supporting frame 
designed to hold the cradle in a desired attitude, 
two or more trolley wheels attached to the frame 
enabling the wheel jack and trolley to be movable, 
and a means whereby a wheel restrained by the  
 
cradle can be raised relative to the trolley wheel 
axle. There is also provided for the cradle to have a 
handle attached thereto, the handle acting, in use, 
as a lever to move a wheel restrained by the cradle 
into its raised position; and for the handle to be 
foldable to a position adjacent the cradle when the 
combination wheel jack and

restrained by the cradle can be raised 

relative to the trolley wheel axle. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley as 
claimed in claim 1 in which the cradle has a 

handle attached thereto, the handle acting, in 
use, as a lever to move a wheel restrained by 

the cradle into its raised position. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley as 

claimed in claim 2 in which the handle is 
 

foldable to a position adjacent the cradle 
when the combination wheel jack and trolley is 

transported or stored. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley as 
claimed in any one of the preceding claims in 

which the combination wheel jack and trolley 
has an hydraulic lifting means to facilitate 

raising a wheel restrained by the cradle 
relative to the trolley wheel axle. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley as 
claimed in claim 4 in which the hydraulic 

lifting means applies a lifting force to 
rollers located towards the operative lower 

side of the cradle. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley as 
claimed in any one of the preceding claims in 

which the supporting frame has three trolley 
wheels one of which enables the combination 

wheel jack and trolley to be steered when 
moved. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley as 
claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6 in which 

the combination wheel jack and trolley has a 
prime mover to motorise the support frame and 

trolley wheels, and also to provide power to 
the hydraulic lifting means which raises a 

wheel restrained by the cradle. 
A combination wheel jack and trolley 
substantially as herein described with 

reference to and as illustrated in Figures 1,2 
and 3.
