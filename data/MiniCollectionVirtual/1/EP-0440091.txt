<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk recording 
apparatus using a magnetic disk of 2 inches (50,8 mm) for example, 
and more particularly, to a disk recording apparatus having 
compatibility with a disk whose storage capacity is 
different. A data recording/reproducing apparatus for 
recording and reproducing digital data to/from a still 
picture recording magnetic disk whose outer diameter is 2 
inches has been known. In addition, handy character 
processing apparatuses having such a magnetic disk have been 
widely used. Conventionally, such a magnetic disk has 50 
circular tracks at pitches of 0.1 mm. The track numbers are 
inwardly assigned from track number 1 to track number 50. 
The storage capacity per track is 16 kilo-bits. Thus, one 
disk can record data of (16 kilo-bits x 50 tracks = 819 
kilo-bits). Thus, the conventional magnetic disk whose 
number of tracks is 50 is hereinafter named the 1M bytes 
disk. On the other hand, a magnetic disk where the 
number of tracks is increased and thereby the storage 
capacity is increased has been proposed. For example, 20 
tracks are newly added on both the outer and inner 
peripheries of the conventional magnetic disk. Since the  
 
new 40 tracks are added to the conventional 50 tracks, the 
total number of tracks becomes 90. When the number of 
tracks becomes 90, data of (16- kilo-bits x 90 tracks = 
1.44 mega-bits) can be recorded per disk. The disk with 90 
tracks is hereinafter named the 2M bytes disk. Magnetic disk drive apparatuses which deal with the 2M 
bytes disk have been developed. The disk drive apparatus 
which deals with the 2M bytes disk should have 
compatibility with the conventional 1M bytes disk. In other 
words, the magnetic disk drive apparatus which deals with 
the 2M bytes should be capable of recording and reproducing 
data to/from the conventional 1M bytes disk. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a method for compatibly recording/reproducing a 
first disk type having a normal number of tracks and a 
second disk type having a higher number of tracks and a 
magnetic disk recording apparatus which has comptability 
between the 1M bytes disk and the 2M bytes disk. According to a first aspect, the invention provides a 
method for compatibly recording/reproducing a first disk 
type having a normal number of tracks and a second disk 
type having a higher number of tracks, both disk types 
having a disk format which is compatible to the normal 
number of tracks and a higher number of tracks, by 
selecting:

<CLAIMS>
A method for compatibly recording/reproducing a first 
disk type (DSC1) having a normal number of tracks and a 

second disk type (DSC2) having a higher number of tracks, 
both disk types (DSC1, DSC2) having a disk format which is 

compatible to the normal number of tracks and the higher 
number of tracks, by selecting: 


a first recording/reproducing mode in accordance with 
track number information of a first and second disk type, 

wherein on a disk of a first and second type the respective 
numbering of tracks is linearly assigned in the radial 

direction of the disk from its one end to its other end, 
and 
a second recording/reproducing mode in accordance with 
said track number information, wherein on a disk of the 

compatible format type said higher number of tracks is 
assigned in a numbering scheme in such a way that the track 

numbering of said first disk type occupies a radial area 
common to that of the first disk type and that a further 

linear numbering of further tracks corresponding to the 
further tracks of said second disk type is offset from said 

numbering according to said first disk type in said common 
radial area. 
A disk recording/reproducing method according to claim 
1, wherein said further recording tracks are at least on 

one extended end of a line in the radial direction of the 
disk beyond the recording tracks of the common, radial 

area.  
 
A disk recording/reproducing method according to claim 
1, wherein said further recording tracks are formed on both 

extended ends of the line in the radial direction of the 
disk beyond the recording tracks of the common radial area. 
A disk recording/reproducing method according to one 
of the claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein in setting said first 

recording mode, track numbers increasing from address 
number 0 are assigned, and in said second recording mode, 

the minus sign track numbers decreasing from address number 
0 are formed in part of disk area. 
A disk reproducing apparatus for reproducing 
compatibly a first disk type having a normal number of 

tracks and a second disk type having a higher number of 
tracks, wherein on a disk of the first and second type the 

respective numbering of tracks is linearly assigned in the 
radial direction of the disk from its one end to its other 

end and on a disk of the compatible format type said higher 
number of tracks is assigned in a numbering scheme in such 

a way that the track numbering of said first disk type 
occupy a radial area common to that of the first disk type 

and that a further linear numbering of further tracks 
corresponding to the further tracks of said second disk 

type is offset from said numbering according to said first 
disk type in said common radial area, said disk apparatus 

comprising: 

a) a reproducing head (4) for picking up recorded 
information from said recording disk (1); 
b) track signal reproducing means (8, 9, 10) for 
reproducing track numbers from a reproduced signal from 

said reproducing head (4), 
c) position sensing means (7) for sensing an access 
position of said reproducing head (4) and outputting track 

numbers; and 
d) recording format decisiion means (8) for deciding 
recording format of said recording disk (1) by comparing  

 
track numbers obtained by said position sensing means (7) 

with track numbers obtained by said reproducing head (4). 
A disk reproducing apparatus according to claim 5, 
further comprising display means 813) for displaying the 

decision result of said recording format decision means.
