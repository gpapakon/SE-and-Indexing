<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cosmetic and 
dermatological compositions useful for the protection 
of the skin from UV radiation. In particular, the 
present invention relates to compositions containing 
stilbene derivatives as the active principle, a process 
for the preparation of said derivatives, novel stilbene 
derivatives having light stabilizing activity. Ultraviolet radiation of sunlight is known to 
exert a damaging action on skin tissue. In fact, prolonged exposure to sunlight is 
considered to be the main cause in the development of 
degenerative processes and of some skin tumours. Ultraviolet radiation is also known to cause 
degradation of synthetic polymers. By using particular compounds, the so-called 
sunscreens, which are capable of absorbing the UV part 
of solar radiation, the damaging effects and the ageing 
of the skin can be prevented or, at least, slowed down. A number of substances have been studied and 
tested as protecting agents, and an extensive patent 
literature exists on this subject, in which compounds 
belonging to different chemical classes are proposed, 
which are capable of absorbing in the ultraviolet 
region, particularly the radiation from 290 to 360 nm. Radiation from 290 to 320 nm (named UV-B) causes 
erythema to form, whereas the one from 320 to 400 nm 
(named UV-A) is responsible for skin suntan.  Sunscreens adsorbing in the UV-B region are widely 
used as protecting agents against sunburn; whereas the 
use of sunscreens to shield skin from UV-A radiations 
was unknown until a short time ago, except in some 
cases of particular therapies. However, recent research has shown that continued 
and intensive UV-A radiation can also cause remarkable 
skin damage, particularly to persons having very 
sensitive, delicate skin. Only a few of the compounds proposed up to now as 
sunscreens proved suitable for practical application, 
among these, p-methoxy-cinnamic acid and p-dimethylaminobenzoic 
acid esters, benzotriazoles, 
hydroxybenzophenones and dibenzoylmethane derivatives. The common drawback of all these compounds is the 
low power thereof to absorb radiation from 290 to 360 
nm, therefore it is necessary to use relatively large 
amounts thereof in cosmetic compositions to obtain an 
optimum light-protecting capability, accordingly the 
use thereof in practice can give rise to problems from 
the toxicological and economic point of view. An optimum UV absorber should have the following 
characteristics: 
1) high specific extinction, which means low 
dosages and
