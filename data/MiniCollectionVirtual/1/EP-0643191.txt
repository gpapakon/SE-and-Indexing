<ABSTRACT>
Coplanar sliding sash for window, door or similar element, comprising an opening leaf (light) (4) and a fixed or semi-fixed leaf (5) of the same size, which leaves are housed in a fixed frame (1), comprising two parallel rails (6, 7) extending over the entire length of the frame, which corresponds to the sum of the widths of the two leaves, such that when the latter are positioned side by side in one of the two rails, they are situated in the same plane and completely close off the frame. According to the invention the two rails communicate, approximately in their middle region with respect to the length of the frame, by means of cross-over switch means (22) for a cam roller (17), fitted with a stud (27) engaged in a reception housing provided at the base of the opening leaf, the two rails each comprising, next to the switch means, two internal shims (wedges) in the shape of raised parallel bars (8, 9-10, 11), and an intermediate guide (26) whose height is greater than that of the bars, the roller having two superimposed levels (18, 19), each of which is fitted with a shaped part which can engage respectively with the internal bars on the one hand and with the intermediate guide on the other hand in order to cause the cam roller to slide and pivot from one rail to the other as it crosses the switch means.

Coplanar sliding wing for a window, door or the 
like, including a mobile leaf (4) and a fixed or semi-fixed 

leaf (5) of the same dimensions, which are housed 
in a fixed frame or opening-lining (1), comprising two 

parallel rails (6, 7) extending along the entire length 
of the frame, which corresponds to the sum of the 

widths of the two leaves, so that these leaves, when 
arranged side by side in one of the two rails, lie in 

the same plane, completely filling the frame, 
characterized in that the two rails communicate, 

substantially in their middle region along the length 
of the frame, by means of a cross-over (22) for a 

cam/runner (17) equipped with a stub (27) engaged in an 
accommodating housing provided at the base of the 

mobile leaf, the two rails each including, in line with 
the cross-over, two internal packing pieces in the form 

of projecting parallel thin strips (8, 9 - 10, 11) and 
an intermediate guide (26) which is taller than the 

thin strips, the runner having two superposed stages 
(18, 19) each fitted with a profiled part capable 

respectively of interacting with the internal thin 
strips on the one hand, and with the intermediate guide 

on the other hand, so as to make the cam/runner slide 
and pivot from one rail to the other at the cross-over 

point.  
 
Sliding wing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the cam/runner (17) has a slot 

formed in its lower stage (18), housed in which slot is 
a small roller (15) for resting on the bottom of the 

rails (6, 7), it being possible for this small roller 
to move in rotation on a horizontal axle (16) mounted 

transversely inside the slot. 
Sliding wing according to either of Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the intermediate guide 

(26) has, in line with the cross-over point (22), an 
inclined bearing surface capable of interacting with 

the bearing surface formed in the upper stage of the 
runner (17). 
Sliding wing according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the lower stage (18) of the 

cam/runner (17) has a rounded edge (20) with a large 
radius of curvature capable of interacting, when 

passing through the cross-over, with the ends (21) of 
the thin strips (8, 9 - 10, 11) mounted in the rails 

(6, 7). 
Sliding wing according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the lateral end of the rail 

(7) which takes the mobile wing when the window is in 
the closed position includes, opposite the cross-over 

point (22), a stop plate (29) which has an inclined 
face (31) interacting with a second runner (33), having 

a single stage, corresponding to the second stage of 
the first cam/runner (17) and also having a rounded 

edge (34) with a large radius of curvature interacting 
with the inclined face of the plate. 
Sliding wing according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the two runners (17, 33) include, 

opposite their rounded edges (20, 34), a straight part 
(25, 36) for guiding these runners in the rails. 
Sliding wing according to any one of Claims 2 
to 6, characterized in that the small rollers (15) for 

resting on the bottom of the rails (6, 7) are 
duplicated depending on the load they have to support.
