<ABSTRACT>
In a thread-winding apparatus with a thread guide moving to and fro and a drive of the bobbin by means of a spooling drum, a hardening of the bobbin occurs at the bobbin edges because the thread jumps inwards at the reversal points of the thread guide as a result of the sharp oblique pull of the large crossing angle. Consequently, bobbins which, although having a low density in the middle, are nevertheless very hard at the edges are wound. This is a great disadvantage, for example in the production of dye bobbins, since it has an adverse influence on the dyeing of the bobbin body.

>
A cross-wound bobbin of uniform density, even at its bobbin edges, is wound if, in the regions of the reversal points (6, 7) of the thread guide (14), the spooling drum (4) has on the circumference a plurality of reversal points (11) for the guidance of the thread (16) which are offset relative to one another.

Yarn take-up arrangement with a traversing yarn guide 
which receives the yarn to be taken up and conveys it in a 

traversing manner onto a bobbin to form a cross-wound 
package, the bobbin resting on a winding drum which drives 

it, has means for guiding the yarn in the yarn laying region 
at its respective ends in the regions of the turning points 

of the yarn guide and is smooth between these two regions,
 
characterised in that, in the regions of the turning points 

(6, 7) of the yarn guide (14) at the periphery, the winding 
drum (4) has a plurality of mutually offset turning points 

(11) for guiding the yarn (16). 
Yarn take-up device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the turning points (11) at the periphery of the 

winding drum (4) consist of the crossing points of two 
intersecting rows of parallel grooves (9, 10) extending 

obliquely to the axis (5) of the winding drums (4) in each 
case. 
Yarn take-up device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the turning points (11) lie in 

succession in parallel rows. 
Yarn take-up device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the turning points (11) in one row are 

staggered relative to the turning points (11) of the adjacent 
rows. 
Yarn take-up device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the turning points (11) are located in 

a friction lining (13) applied to the winding drum (4).
