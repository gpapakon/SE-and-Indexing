 PENETRATION AND BLAST RESISTANT COMPOSITES ANP ARTICLESBackground of the Invention1. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to composites and articles fabricated therefrom. More particularly, this invention relates to composites and articles having improved blast and penetration protection.2. PRIOR ARTBallistic articles such as bulletproof vests, helmets, structural members of helicopters and other military equipment, vehicle panels, briefcases, raincoats and umbrellas containing high strength fibers are known. Illustrative of such articles are those described in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,623,574; 4,748,064; 4,413,110; 4,737,402; 4,613,535; 4,650,710; 4,737,402; 4,916,000; 4,403,012, 4,457,985; 4,737,401; 4,543,286; 4,5143,392 and 4,501,856.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a composite exhibiting resistance to penetration by a threat, said composite comprising at least two layers, at least one of said layers being a layer comprised of a metal, a metal/ceramic composite or a combination thereof (••metal layer") positioned on the impact side of said composite exposed to a said threat and at least one of said layers being a fibrous layer comprising a fiber network in a polymeric matrix position and on the non¬ impact side of said metal layer, wherein the relative weight percent of said metal layer and said fibrous layer are selected such that the penetration resistance of said composite to high and/or low length to diameter (L/D) threats at some angle of incidence is greater than the additive effects of said layers expected from 

the rule of mixtures. Another embodiment of this invention relates to an article of manufacture comprising a body all or a portion of which is constructed from the composite of this invention, as for example a helmet. Yet another aspect of this invention relates to an improved penetration resistant composite of the type comprising at least one substrate layer having one or more rigid planar "penetration resistant" bodies affixed to a surface thereof, the improvement comprising bodies comprising at least two layers, at least one of said layers being a layer comprising a metal, a metal/ceramic composite or a combination thereof positioned on the impact side of said layer and at least one of said layers being a fibrous layer comprising a fiber network in a polymer matrix, wherein the relative weight percent of said metal and fibrous layers are selected such that the penetration resistance of said bodies to high and/or low L/D threats at some angle of incidence

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An improved penetration resistant composite comprising at least two layers, at least one of said layers being a metal layer comprising a metal, a metal/ceramic composite or a combination thereof positioned on the impact side of said composite exposed to said threat and at least one of said layers being a fibrous layer comprising a fiber network in a polymeric matrix positioned on the non-impact side wherein the weight ratio of said metal layer to said fibrous layer is selected such that the penetration resistance of said composite to a threat is greater than the additive effect of said layers expected under the rule of mixtures. 2. A composite as recited in claim 1 wherein said metal layer and said fibrous layer are of uniform or substantially uniform thickness.
3. A composite as recited in claim 2 wherein the weight percent of said metal layer is from about 2 to about 98 and the weight percent of said fibrous layer is from about 98 to about 2 based on the total of said composite.
4. A composite as recited in claim 3 wherein the weight percent of said metal layer is from about 20 to about 80 and the weight percent of said fibrous layer is from about 80 to about 20.
5. A composite as recited in claim 5 wherein the weight percent of said metal layer is from about 50 to about 3 5 and the weight percent of said fibrous layer is from about 50 to about 65.
6. A composite as recited in claim 3 wherein said fibrous layer comprises a network of fibers having a tensile strength equal to or greater than about 10 g/d, a tensile modulus equal to or greater than about 500 g/d, and an energy-to-break is equal to or greater than about 20 j/g.
7. A composite as recited in claim 6 wherein 


said fibers are polyethylene fibers, aramid fibers, polyester fibers, nylon fibers, glass fibers or mixtures thereof.
8. A composite as recited in claim 7 wherein said fibers are polyethylene fibers.
9. A composite as recited in claim 7 wherein said fibrous layer comprises at least one sheet-like fiber array in which said fibers are arranged substantially parallel to one another along a common fiber direction .
10. A composite as recited in claim 9 wherein said fibrous layer comprises more than one array, with adjacent arrays aligned at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the parallel filaments contained in said adjacent array.
11. A composite as recited in claim 7 wherein said substrate layer comprises a : on-woven fabric, a woven fabric or a combination thereof.
12. An article of manufacture comprising a body formed totally or in part from the composite of claim 1.
13. An improved penetration resistant composite of the type comprising at least one substrate layer having one or more planar bodies affixed to a surface thereof, the improvement comprising laminated planar bodies comprising at least two layers, at least one of said layers being a metal layer positioned on the impact side of said composite bodies exposed to said threat and at least one of said layers being a fibrous layer comprising a fiber network in a polymeric matrix positioned on the non-impact side, wherein the weight ratio of said metal layer to said fibrous layer is selected such that the penetration resistance of said composite to a threat is greater than the additive effect of said layers expected under the rule of mixtures.
14. A article of manufacture comprising a 


body formed totally or in part from the composite of claim 13.
