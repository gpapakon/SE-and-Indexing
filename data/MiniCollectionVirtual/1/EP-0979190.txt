<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a power puller motor bogie comprising at least a gear motor (6, 10) arranged inside the bogie chassis (4), said gear motor (6, 10) being suspended in said bogie chassis (4) by means of at least two elastic connecting rods (7, 8, 9). Said elastic connecting rods (7, 8, 9) are all supported by said bogie chassis (4). Said elastic connecting rods (7, 8, 9) are such that said suspended gear motor (6, 10) is transversely mobile relative to said vehicle longitudinal direction of movement acts as inertia damper. A shock absorber (12) is fixed between said bogie chassis (4) and said gear motor (6, 10).

<CLAIMS>
Traction vehicle motor bogie having at least one geared motor (6, 10) arranged inside a bogie frame (4), with the said geared motor (6, 10) being suspended in the said bogie frame (4) using at least two elastic links (7, 8, 9), the said elastic links (7, 8, 9) all being supported on the said bogie frame (4), the said elastic links (7, 8, 9) being such that the said suspended geared motor (6, 10) is movable transversely to the longitudinal direction of movement of the said vehicle, with a shock absorber (12) being fixed between the said bogie frame (4) and the said geared motor (6, 10), 
characterised in that
 the geared motor (6, 10) is movable in translation transversely to the longitudinal direction of movement of the said vehicle in order to act as an inertia damper.
Motor bogie according to claim 1 in which the geared motor (6, 10) is movable in translation with a lateral travel of at least 30 mm.
Motor bogie according to any of the claims 1 to 2, in which the said geared motor (6, 10) is suspended from the axle side (20) to the said bogie frame (4) by one link (9) and, on the motor side (6), to the said bogie frame (4) by two links (7, 8).
Motor bogie according to any of the claims 1 to 2, in which the said geared motor (6, 10) is suspended from the axle side to the said bogie frame (4) by two links (7, 8) and, on the motor side (6) to the said bogie frame (4) by one link (9).
Traction vehicle having at least one motor bogie according to any one of the previous claims.
