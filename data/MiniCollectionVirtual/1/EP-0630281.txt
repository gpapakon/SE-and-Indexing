<ABSTRACT>
A pleated, all poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) filter element (20) incorporating a poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) filter membrane (24) is shown and described. The membrane is supported by an all poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) paper (26) and (28), which permits filtrate to pass through the paper and across the poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) membrane. A sandwich is formed by placing a layer of poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) filter membrane (24) between the two layers of poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) support paper, (26) and (28), and the sandwich is then pleated prior to assembly around a core (14) and between end caps (12) and (18), which are bonded to the poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) paper and poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) filter membrane by a hot-melt process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of filter 
elements constructed with poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene); 
i.e., "PTFE" resin membranes. Membranes made of 
poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene), such as Teflon®, are used for 
filtration in the fields of foods, semi-conductors, and 
the like. These filters are also used in fields where 
highly reactive chemicals are in use. Poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) membrane filters, in a 
variety of constructions have proven attractive in a 
variety of fields where the unique properties of 
poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) resins afford particular 
advantage. Among the virtues of poly(tetra-fluoro 
ethylene) materials are their chemical inertness and high 
temperature characteristics. Poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) membranes are based on 
stretching, often biaxially, a film of the polymer. Such 
materials are commercially available from a variety of 
sources, in a range of properties such as pore diameter, 
thickness, and engineering properties. Filter cartridges of pleated poly(tetra-fluoro 
ethylene) membranes are known in the art and have proven 
to be of considerable use, both for the particular 
properties of the poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) membrane and 
for the facility and convenience of the cartridge form. As those of ordinary skill in the art understand, it 
is desirable to minimize the use of materials other than 
poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) in the fabrication of such 
pleated membrane cartridges. While it has not proven 
possible to date to eliminate all materials other than 
poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) in such cartridges, it has 
been possible to substitute other fluorocarbon polymers 
which offer some of the properties of poly(tetra-fluoro 
ethylene), in combination with true thermoplastic  
 
characteristics which enable the fabrication of pleated 
membrane cartridges. Poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) membranes require 
structural support to withstand the stresses of 
filtration. In pleated cartridges, the membrane is 
ordinarily sandwiched between porous webs of other 
materials which provide adequate structural 
characteristics to protect the membrane. Such pleated membrane filter cartridges made wholly 
of fluorocarbon resins are known in the prior art as 
illustrated in US-A-4663041. This 
teaches the use of a 
poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) membrane as the essential 
filter medium. The filter element is produced by pleating 
a sandwich-form shape comprising a filter membrane made of 
poly(tetra-fluoro ethylene) resin and fluorocarbon 
thermoplastic polymer net mesh supports
