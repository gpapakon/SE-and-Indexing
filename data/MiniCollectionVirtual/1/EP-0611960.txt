<ABSTRACT>
A method for testing a vibration damper of a motor vehicle chassis, in which process variables which are associated with a vertical movement of the vehicle are fed to a mathematical model which represents, on the one hand, the relationship between the vertical acceleration of the vehicle wheel and of the vehicle construction and, on the other hand, estimated parameters which are estimated according to a parameter estimation method known per se, and in which the damping coefficient is obtained herefrom as an estimated value, and a comparison is carried out for the vibration damper testing between estimated damping coefficient and reference value.

A method of testing a shock absorber (3) of a motor vehicle,
wherein by footprint excitation oscillations are transmitted by way of

a motor vehicle wheel (7) standing on a wheel support surface to the
motor vehicle wheel suspension including the shock absorber (3) to be

tested and in that operation the damping characteristic is determined,

   characterised in that

   the differences of the movement amplitudes (Z
R
-Z
A
) and speeds
(Z'
R
-Z'
A
) of the wheel (7) and those of the vehicle body (1) are
related to the acceleration of the wheel (Z"
R
) or the dynamic wheel
support force and the damping coefficient (d
A
) is estimated from said
relationship in accordance with a parameter estimation process, and

that for quality testing of the shock absorber (3) the estimated
damping coefficient is compared to-a reference value and for quality

testing it is ascertained whether a deviation from the reference value
lies within a tolerance range.
