<ABSTRACT>
A catheter assembly for treatment of cardiac
arrhythmia, for example, atrial fibrillation, by

electrically isolating a vessel, such as a pulmonary
vein, from a chamber, such as the left atrium. The

catheter assembly includes a catheter body 22 and at
least one electrode 26. The catheter body includes a

proximal portion 28, an intermediate portion 30 and a
distal portion 32. The intermediate portion extends

from the proximal portion and defines a longitudinal
axis. The distal portion extends from the intermediate

portion and forms a substantially closed loop 34,
parallel or transverse to the longitudinal axis. The at

least one electrode 26 is disposed along the loop. With
this configuration, the loop is axially directed into

contact with the chamber wall about the vessel ostium.
Upon energization, the electrode ablates a continuous

lesion pattern about the vessel ostium, thereby
electrically isolating the vessel from the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ablation catheter for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, for example atrial fibrillation. More particularly, it relates to an ablation catheter configured to electrically isolate a vessel, such as a pulmonary vein, from a chamber, such as the left atrium with a continuous lesion pattern.The heart includes a number of pathways that are responsible for the propagation of signals necessary to produce continuous, synchronized contractions. Each contraction cycle begins in the right atrium where a sinoatral node initiates an electrical impulse. This impulse then spreads across the right atrium to the left atrium, stimulating the atria to contract. The chain reaction continues from the atria to the ventricles by passing through a pathway known as the atrioventricular (AV) node or junction, which acts as an electrical gateway to the ventricles. The AV junction delivers the signal to the ventricles while also slowing it, so the atria can relax before the ventricles contract.Disturbances in the heart's electrical system may lead to various rhythmic problems that can cause the heart to beat irregularly, too fast or too slow. Irregular heart beats, or arrhythmia, are caused by physiological or pathological disturbances in the discharge of electrical impulses from the sinoatrial node, in the transmission of the signal through the heart tissue, or spontaneous, unexpected electrical signals generated within the heart. One type of arrhythmia is tachycardia, which is an abnormal rapidity of heart action. There are several different forms of atrial tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. With atrial fibrillation, instead of a single beat, numerous electrical impulses are generated by depolarizing tissue at one or more locations in the atria (or possibly other locations). These unexpected electrical impulses produce irregular, often rapid heartbeats in the atrial muscles and ventricles. Patients experiencing atrial fibrillation may suffer from fatigue, activity intolerance, dizziness and even strokes.The precise cause of atrial fibrillation, and in particular the depolarizing tissue causing "extra" electrical signals, is currently unknown. As to the location of the depolarizing tissue, it is generally agreed that the undesired electrical impulses often originate in the left atrial region of the heart. Recent studies have expanded upon this general understanding, suggesting that nearly 90% of these "focal triggers" or electrical impulses are generated in one (or
