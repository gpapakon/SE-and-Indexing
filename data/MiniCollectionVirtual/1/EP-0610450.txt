<CLAIMS>
Paints based on a binder consisting of amounts
corresponding to a combination of


a) a polyol component dissolved and/or dispersed in water
or a water/solvent mixture and
b) a polyisocyanate component emulsifiable in solution
and/or dispersion a) and consisting of organic

polyisocyanates with free isocyanate groups and a
viscosity at 23 °C of 50 to 10000 mPa·s

in an equivalent proportion of isocyanate groups of
component b) to alcoholic hydroxyl groups in solution

and/or dispersion a) of 0.5 : 1 to 5 : 1, 
characterised in
that
 the polyol component consists substantially of

a1) a water-dilutable polycondensation resin having
hydoxyl groups and without urethane groups and sulfonate

groups, with a molecular weight Mn of more than 500, or
a2) a mixture of such a polycondensation resin with up to
100 wt %, referred to the weight of the polycondensation

resin, of at least one water-dilutable polymerisation
resin having hydroxyl groups, with a molecular weight Mn

of more than 500;

except for binders in which component a) consists of 5 to
70 wt %, referred to the weight of component a1) or a2),

of a reactive diluent which is a compound water-soluble, 
non-distillable at standard pressure or with a boiling

point of at least 150 °C and having a molecular weight Mn
of less than 500 and at least one group reacti
ve to
isocyanate groups.
Process for manufacturing a paint according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 a polyisocyanate component
consisting of organic polyisocyanates with free isocyanate

groups and a viscosity at 23 °C of 50 to 10000 mPa·s is
emulsified in an aqueous or aqueous-organic solution or

dispersion of a polyol component consisting substantially
of


a1) a water-dilutable polycondensation resin having
hydoxyl groups and without urethane groups and sulfonate

groups, with a molecular weight Mn of more than 500, or
a2) a mixture of such a polycondensation resin with up to
100 wt %, referred to the weight of the polycondensation

resin, of at least one water-dilutable polymerisation
resin having hydroxyl groups, with a molecular weight Mn

of more than 500,

in which the equivalent proportion of isocyanate groups of
the polyisocyanate component to alcoholic hydroxyl groups

in the solution or dispersion of the polyol component
comes to 0.5 : 1 to 5 : 1;

except for processes in which the polyol component
consists of 5 to 70 wt %, referred to the weight of

component a1) or a2), of a reactive diluent which is a 
compound water-soluable, non-distillable at standard

pressure or with a boiling point of at least 150 °C and
having a molecular weight Mn of less than 500 and at least

one group reactive to isocyanate groups.
Use of the paints according to claim 1 for preparing
primer coats or top coats.
Process for the painting of substrates, in which paints
according to claim 1 are applied to a substrate and are

cured at room temperature to 160 °C.
Painted substrate obtainable according to claim 4.
