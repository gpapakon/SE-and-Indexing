<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing a generator which is capable 
of producing large electric power at a low cost without substantially 

using fossil fuel and without contaminating the global environment, 
and which can be used instead of a thermal power generating machine. 

The present invention is characterized in that a solution consisting 
of a solvent which does not dissociate itself, and a substance 

added to and dissociating in the solvent, is held in a container having 
an inner corrosion resisting and insulating surface, an anode of a 

small work function and a cathode of a large work function being 
immersed in a mutually opposed state in this solution. The present 

invention is characterized in that it has a container having an inner 
corrosion resisting and insulating surface, a solution held in an atmospheric 

air-isolated state in the interior of the container and consisting 
of a liquid of an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and water 

added thereto, an anode consisting of a material having corrosion resistance 
and a small work function and a cathode consisting of a material 

having corrosion resistance and a large work function which 
are immersed in a mutually opposed state in the solution, and a heat 

application means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power generator, and 
in particular relates to a power generator which consumes almost 
no fossil fuels, does not pollute the environment, and which 
makes it possible to obtain large amounts of power at low cost. Presently, power generators can be classified into 
thermal power generators, hydroelectric power generators, nuclear 
power generators, solar power generators, and the like. However, thermal power generators, which are presently 
the main form of power generator, generate CO₂ gas, and are thus 
a substantial contributor to the present global warming; 
furthermore, they necessitate the widespread use of antipollution 
devices in order to prevent the atmospheric pollution which 
results from the combustion of large amounts of fossil fuels such 
as petroleum and coal. Hydroelectric power generators do not present the problem 
of atmospheric pollution; however, not only are a great number of 
sites required for dam construction and the like, but also almost 
no appropriate sites having economically advantageous site 
conditions remain. As can be seen from the case of the Chernobyl accident, 
should an accident occur in a nuclear power generator, the 
effects on the environment and human beings are extremely great. 
At the same time, uranium, which serves as the raw material for 
such power plants, is a type of fossil fuel, so that the amount 
of underground deposits thereof is limited. Solar cell power generators make it possible to obtain 
clean power; however, the cost thereof is high, and the service  
 
life of the devices is short, and large-scale power generation is 
difficult. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
power generator which uses almost no fossil fuels, does not 
pollute the environment, and makes it possible to obtain large 
amounts of power at low cost. In order to solve the above-stated problems, in the power 
generator of the present invention, a solution comprising a 
solvent, which itself does not dissociate, having added thereto a 
substance which dissociates in this solvent, is placed within a 
container having an inner surface possessing corrosion resistance 
and electrically insulating properties with respect to the 
solution,
 
   an anode electrode having a small work function, and a 
cathode electrode having a large work function, are immersed in 
the solution stored within the container, in a mutually opposing 
manner, and
 
   a heat application mechanism for applying predetermined 
heat to the solution, are
