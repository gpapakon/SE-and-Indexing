<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile radio telecommunications system having a 
switching unit (17), a control station (18) connected to the 

switching unit, a plurality of base stations (65, 66, 67, 68, 105, 106, 
107, 108, 117, 118) connected to the switching unit, and a plurality 

of mobile stations (29, 120) connected to the base stations by a 
radio channel (14), the base stations are respectively situated at 

private property (61, 62, 63, 64, 101, 102, 103, 104, 113, 114), and 
each includes a controller (73) for determining a direction in which 

a mobile stations is moving. The controller (73) receives via the 
control station (18) and switching unit (17) information 

representative of the levels at which the individual base stations 
have received a radio wave from a mobile station, compares the 

received levels, determines, based on the result of comparison, that 
one of the base stations having the highest received level currently 

covers the mobile station, and determines a direction in which the 
mobile station is moving on the basis of a transition of the highest 

received level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mobile radio
telecommunications system and, more particularly, to a mobile
radio telecommunications system feasible for portable telephones.
The invention is also concerned with procedures for setting
up connection for calls originating and terminating, switching a
radio zone and a base station while a conversation is under way,
and registering locations.Conventional mobile radio telecommunications systems
include an automobile telephone and portable telephone system. It
is a common practice with an automobile telephone and portable
telephone system to arrange bidimensionally a plurality of base
stations each covering a particular radio zone or service zone. The
zones assigned to nearby base stations overlap each other in order
to allow a conversation to be continued on a mobile station over the
adjoining zones. This kind of system is referred to as a cellular
radio telephone communication system.In the conventional cellular radio telephone communication
system, a mobile station accesses, for example, a landline telephone
included in a wire-line telephone network by the following
procedure. To begin with, the mobile station sends a calling signal 
to base stations adjoining it. In response, the base stations each
sends a calling signal, including a received level thereof, to a radio
channel control station. The radio channel control station selects
one of the base stations whose received level is highest and
determines that the mobile station exists in the zone assigned to
that base station. Then, the control station sends the calling signal
to a mobile telecommunications switching office. On receiving the
calling signal, the switching office sets up connection between the
base station of interest and the wire-line telephone network. To
terminate a call at a mobile station, it is necessary to determine a
zone currently covering the mobile station. This has customarily
been done by calling a plurality of zones from the telephone
network side by broadcasting in response to every terminating call,
detecting a response from a mobile station of interest, i.e., a base
station having the highest received level in order to locate the
mobile station, and then terminating the call at the mobile station.Assume that a mobile station is transferred from one zone to
another zone while a conversation is held thereon. Then, to switch
the zone, the base station whose zone currently covers the mobile
station constantly monitors the level at which it receives a radio
wave from the mobile
