<ABSTRACT>
Restenosis following angioplasty can be inhibited by reducing 
the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the blood 

vessel walls at an angioplasty site, and such reduction in 
cell proliferation can be accomplished by an apparatus which 

irradiates the angioplasty site with radiation in the ultraviolet 
(UV) wavelength range. The ultraviolet radiation is 

preferably delivered via an optical fiber or other waveguide 
incorporated, for example, into a percutaneous catheter. In 

operation, the ultraviolet radiation kills smooth muscle cells 
at the site, thereby reducing the risk of restenosis, while 

minimising damage to surrounding tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention is
surgical instruments and, in
particular, systems for inhibiting
restenosis associated with angioplasty.Atherosclerosis is a disease which causes
thickening and hardening of the arteries,
characterized by lesions of raised fibrous plaque
formed within the arterial lumen. Atherosclerotic
plaque is commonly treated by means of angioplasty
through the use of a balloon catheter. Balloon
angioplasty involves passing a small, balloon-tipped
catheter percutaneously into an artery and up to the
region of obstruction. The balloon is then inflated
to dilate the area of obstruction. Other devices,
such as atherosclerectomy instruments which remove
obstructions by peeling or shaving plaque from the
artery wall, are also utilized in the treatment of
atherosclerosis. More recently, laser systems have
been proposed for performing angioplasty. In laser
angioplasty, a catheter carrying a fiber optic
waveguide is passed through a blood vessel,
positioned near an obstruction, and then activated to
decompose the plaque with laser radiation. At present, over 200,000 angioplasty
procedures are performed each year in the United
States. Unfortunately, restenosis, or closure of the
blood vessel following angioplasty, is a common
occurrence following all types of such surgery.
Approximately 30% of segments dilated by means of
balloon catheter will develop significant restenosis,
with peak incidence occurring between 2 and 3 months
after angioplasty. Similar restenosis rates
accompany laser angioplasty. When restenosis occurs,
further coronary difficulties can result including
strokes, arrhythmia, infarcts and even death.Evidence suggests that intimal hyperplasia
or proliferation of smooth muscle cells is a major
factor in restenosis. Proliferation of smooth muscle
cells is very common in patients after angioplasty,
whether or not restenosis occurs. Medial smooth
muscle cells, a main component of the arterial wall,
proliferate in response to any injury to the arterial
wall. Smooth muscle cells enter their growth cycle
between 2 and 3 days after injury, and the majority
of smooth muscle cells will cease to proliferate
within 7 days. The total number of smooth muscle
cells in the intima reaches a peak about two weeks
after injury and remains constant for up to one year,
suggesting that a reduction of the number of smooth
muscle cells injured during angioplasty will reduce
the likelihood of subsequent restenosis. See,

Angioplasty, Potential
