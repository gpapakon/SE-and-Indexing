<ABSTRACT>
Power surge resistor pastes comprising palladium/silver, glass and 
dopant(s) are described for use in the manufacture of power surge resistor 

devices employed for power surge protection applications. The resultant surge 
resistors are characterized in their ability to dissipate repeated voltage surges 

equal in voltage and duration to surges created by lightning with less than 0.05% 
change in sheet resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved electrically conductive compositions 
(pastes) employed in the manufacture of power surge resistor devices employed for 
power surge protection applications. The compositions are capable of being 
deposited by screen printing on alumina and similar ceramic substrates and the 
resultant surge resistors are characterized in their ability to dissipate 
repeated voltage surges equal in voltage and duration to surges created by 
lightning with less than 0.05% change in sheet resistance. Voltage surge protective devices known in the art encompass a variety of 
materials, including, for example, epoxy/silicon, copper-nickel combinations, 
zinc oxide and zinc oxide with other oxide additives, forms and designs, and 
exhibit a variety of operating characteristics. Power surge resistor devices of interest here are electrical devices 
manufactured with formulated resistor pastes or compositions based on 
palladium/silver powders or particles, glass and dopant(s). When a surge 
resistor device is wired into an electrical circuit, the electrical circuit is 
protected from damage by excess surges of line voltage such as may occur when the 
power line connected to a circuit is struck by lightning. Such devices are 
commonly wired into the electronic circuitry of television receivers, telephones, 
data processing equipment, computer elements and the like as a means for 
lightning strike and voltage surge protection. Manufacturers of such protective devices are constantly searching for surge 
resistor pastes which will provide improved surge protection devices, 
particularly with respect to repeated voltage surges or lightning strikes. 
Informal standards set by industry and Underwriters Laboratories require the 
devices to withstand 20-200 multiple pulse surges at 2,500 volts and 1,000 volts, 
respectively, with less than 2% shift in sheet resistance.  
 Commercially available resistor pastes are also deficient in exhibiting 
temperature coefficient of resistance values (TCR) which are higher than desired 
by the device manufacturers. The relationship between the resistance change as 
a function of temperature is designated as the TCR of the protective device and 
defined as parts per million parts change per degree centigrade of temperature 
change, i.e., ppm/°C. Lower TCR values over a designated range of temperatures 
are now required for commercial acceptance as compared to TCR values of pastes 
sold 5-7 years ago. The resistor pastes of this invention provide surge protection
