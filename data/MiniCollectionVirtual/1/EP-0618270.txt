<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide 
an element, such as casings, cards, boards or sheets, 

suitable for mounting, protecting or sustaining 
electric/electronic parts-integrated modules and 

SMT-applicable electric/electronic parts, which 
adequately satisfies the basic properties such as 

mechanical strength, thermal properties such as 

resistance to heat by soldering or thermal endurance, 
precision of shape, high-temperature dimensional 

stability, insulation, moisture resistance, 
fire-proofing, etc. and additional properties such as 

toughness and adhesion to sealing materials. 
The element is made from an polyarylene sulfide 
resin composition which comprises 100 parts by weight of 

a polyarylene sulfide substantially not cross-linked by 
thermal oxidation, 1-25 parts by weight of an ethylenic 

copolymer comprising 50-90 wt% of ethylene, 5-49 wt% of 
α , β -unsaturated alkyl carboxylate and 0.5-10 wt% of 

maleic anhydride, 0.5-10 parts by weight of an Mg/Al 
oxide solid solution, and optionally 3 parts by weight or 

less of di(cyclohexyl)ammonium nitrite and 25-150 parts 
by weight of a reinforcing filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyarylene 
sulfide resin composition, an element for protecting and 
sustaining an electric/electronic parts-integrated module 
and a member for protecting and sustaining SMT (surface 
mount technology)-applicable electric/electronic parts. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
polyarylene sulfide resin composition suitable for 
producing molded articles for electric/electronic 
devices, and molded articles from said polyarylene 
sulfide resin composition, particularly sealed modules 
such as power modules, relays such as an SMT-applicable 
relay and a solid state relay, switches such as an 
SMT-applicable switch, or not only parts such as casings, 
bases, cards or connectors, etc., for said modules 
containing an electric circuit therein but also elements 
for protecting and sustaining electric/electronic 
parts-integrated modules and SMT-applicable 
electric/electronic parts. Demands on a power module used as a power-controlling 
circuit, particularly a power convertor unit  
 
have been rapidly increased for the recent ten years as 
inverter air conditioners are being popularized. The 
power module is one of power devices, which may be a 
so-called "hybrid IC", because it is made to have one or 
more functions by combining individual semiconductor 
chips or devices. Generally, a plurality of the power 
devices including semiconductors or devices such as 
diodes, thyristors and transistors are connected to take 
a predetermined structure in a packaged unit. For packaging of such devices such as power modules, 
resin sealings have hitherto been widely used by transfer 
molding thermoplastic resins such as epoxy resins or 
silicone resins. However, particularly the power modules may have a 
package of a considerably large size, although the size 
varies depending upon the use of the module. In the case 
where such large size modules are to be sealed with a 
resin, there are raised various problems. In fact, when 
the module packages of a size exceeding a certain value, 
particularly about 4 cm are sealed with a resin such as 
an epoxy resin, there are raised such problems that 
cracks are generated due to internal stress or production 
costs increase. In the case above, there has been taken a process 
for making firm packages by providing casings or 
substrates and then integrating the modules in the casings 
or bases through a casting resin sealing method. Modules such as modules accompanied with a general 
sealing or modules including an electric
