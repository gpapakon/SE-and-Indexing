<ABSTRACT>
A rotor assembly for processing a liquid comprises a rotor body 
(52) which is rotatable about an his of rotation (R). The rotor body 

comprises: a first cavity region for containing a liquid, said first 
cavity region having an outer wall at an alpha radial distance from 

said axis of rotation (R); a second cavity region; and liquid diverting 
means for diverting substantially all of said liquid from said first 

cavity region to said second cavity region when said rotor body (52) is 
rotated in a manner imparting momentum to liquid contained within said 

first cavity region and then rapidly stopped. The liquid diverting 
means has an influent end positioned at said alpha radial distance, 

said influent end being in fluid communication with said first cavity 
region, and an effluent end positioned at a beta radial distance from 

said axis of rotation, said effluent end being in fluid communication 
with said second cavity region and said beta radial distance being less 

than said alpha radial distance. The liquid diverting means defines a 
liquid flow path between said influent end and said effluen
t end, said 
liquid flow path corresponding to the direction in which said rotor 

body (52) is rotated about said axis of rotation. The liquid 
diverting means includes backflow preventing means to prevent backflow 

of liquid into said first cavity region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has rights in this invention 
pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC05-84OR21400 with Martin 
Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., awarded by the U.S. 
Department of Energy. This invention is a continuation-in-part application 
of U.S. Patent No. 4,835,106, 
issued May 30, 1989, and entitled ROTOR FOR PROCESSING 
LIQUIDS USING MOVABLE CAPILLARY TUBES. This invention relates generally to a rotor for 
processing liquids. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a rotor with which a number of bioanalytical 
processing steps can be automatically performed on a 
liquid and a method of using the rotor. Rotors for use during the processing of liquids are 
known. One such rotor, described in U.S. Patent 
3,901,658, discloses a rotor assembly for performing 
photometric analyses using whole blood samples. The 
rotor assembly includes a cell sedimentation bowl for  
 
centrifugally separating red blood cells from plasma. 
Following separation, the plasma is displaced from the 
sedimentation bowl, and measured sub-volumes are 
distributed to respective sample analyses cuvettes 
positioned in an angular array about the rotor periphery. 
Another rotor, described in U.S. Patent 4,515,889 is 
utilized for mixing and incubating a sample solution with 
at least one reagent and optically measuring a parameter 
in the incubated reaction mixture. Each step of mixing, 
incubating and measuring is carried out under the 
influence of centrifugal forces generated by the rotation 
of the rotor. Other examples of rotors are set forth in 
the referenced 
U.S. Patent No. 4,835,106 whose disclosure 
is incorporated herein by reference. Historically, the aliquoting of liquid samples and 
diluents for use in a rotor has been performed by hand 
prior to introduction of the aliquot within the rotor for 
a processing step. It would be desirable to provide a 
rotor wherein a measured amount of aliquot can be 
automatically separated from an excess amount of liquid 
introduced within the rotor without the use of capillary 
tubes, moving parts supported within the rotor or manual 
intervention of an analyst. In addition, transfer of liquids within the rotor 
from one chamber of the rotor to another for processing 
purposes has presented difficulties due to space 
limitations within the rotor which can be dedicated to 
transfer mechanisms. Hence, it would also be desirable 
to provide a rotor wherein liquid can be transferred from 
one character of the rotor to another without the use of 
transfer mechanisms internal of the rotor.

<CLAIMS>
A rotor assembly for processing a liquid comprising a rotor body 
(52) which is rotatable about an axis of rotation (R), said rotor body 

comprising: 

a first cavity region (70, 72) for containing a liquid, said first cavity 
region having an outer wall at an (alpha) radial distance from said axis 

of rotation (R); 
a second cavity region (112); and 
liquid diverting means (118) for diverting substantially all of said 
liquid from said first cavity region (70) to said second cavity region (112) when 

said rotor body (52) is rotated in a manner imparting momentum to 
liquid contained with
in said first cavity region (70) and then rapidly 
stopped, said liquid diverting means (118) having an influent end positioned 

at said alpha radial distance, said influent end being in fluid 
communication with said first cavity region, and said liquid diverting 

means having an effluent end positioned at a (beta) radial distance from 
said axis of rotation, said effluent end being in fluid communication 

with said second cavity region (112), wherein said (beta) radial distance is 
less than said (alpha) radial distance, wherein said liquid diverting 

means defines a liquid flow path between said influent end and said 
effluent end, said liquid flow path corresponding to the direction in 

which said rotor body (52) is rotated about said axis of rotation, and 
wherein said liquid diverting means (118) includes backflow preventing means 

to prevent backflow of liquid into said first cavity region. 
A rotor assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said second 
cavity region is positioned closer to said axis of rotation than is 

said first cavity region. 
A rotor assembly as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
rotor body (52) has top (54), bottom (58), and lateral (56) surfaces, and has an 

opening (152) in one of said surfaces, and wherein said second cavity 
region (112) is provided by said liquid diverting means (118), said liquid 

diverting means extending between said first cavity region (70, 72) and said 
opening (152) so that upon rapidly stopping the rotation of said rotor 

body (52), liquid is transferred through said opening (152) by way of  
 

said liquid diverting means. 
A method for processing a liquid using apparatus as claimed in 
any preceding claim, the method comprising: 


introducing liquid into the first cavity region (70, 72); 
rotating the body (52) in said direction in a manner imparting 
momentum to liquid contained within the first cavity region; and 
rapidly stopping the rotation of the body (52) so that liquid 
contained within the first cavity region is transferred to the second 

cavity region by means of the imparted momentum.
