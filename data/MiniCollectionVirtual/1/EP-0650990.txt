<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a polyurethane foam by the reaction of a polyol
with a polyisocyanate in the presence of an amine
catalyst, a blowing agent, and a foam stabilizer.
Particularly, the present invention relates to a process
for producing a flexible or rigid polyurethane foam by use
of an amine catalyst having a long-chain aliphatic group
in the molecule having less odor and lower volatility and
exhibiting high curing rate and improved moldability with
a formulation comprising a reduced amount of chloro fluorocarbons
and an increased amount of water as the blowing agent. The flexible
polyurethane foam herein includes semi-rigid polyurethane
foams, since the same polyol is used.Polyurethane foams are widely used as flexible
foams e.g. for automobile seat cushions, mattresses and furniture;
as semi-rigid foams e.g. for automobile instrument
panels, head rests and arm rests; and as rigid foams e.g.
for refrigerators and building materials.In recent years, polyurethane foams are desired
to be improved in curing rate, demolding time, and
foam yield in order to reduce polyurethane production
cost and increase foam productivity. The polyurethane foam is
formed mainly through two reactions including a reaction
of a polyol with an isocyanate (gelling reaction) to form 
a urethane linkage, and a reaction of an isocyanate with
water (blowing reaction) to form a urea linkage and to
evolve carbon dioxide. The catalyst affects not only the
reaction rates but also the curing rate, the moldability,
the flowability of the foam, foam density and the
properties of the foam.In recent years, reduction of use of
chlorofluorocarbons, so-called CFCs such as
trichloromonofluoromethane, and dichlorodifluoromethane
which causes ozone layer destruction, improvement of
working environment, and reduction of emission of
evaporative substances from products, and the like
environmental problems are attracting attention.
Formulations have been investigated in which the amount of CFC as the
blowing agent is reduced and the amount of water is increased. The
increase of the amount of water as the blowing agent, however, lowers
greatly the curing rate of the foam, and impairs
significantly the moldability as well as the adhesive
strength and dimensional stability of the rigid foam.
Accordingly, a catalyst is strongly requested which is
suitable for the formulation containing a decreased amount
of CFC and increased amount of water.As the catalyst for polyurethane production,
organometallic compounds and
