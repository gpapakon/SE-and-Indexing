<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method and apparatus for gel 
electrophoresis which simultaneously employs two or more 

electric fields in a single gel. According to this 
invention, which is defined as Multiple-Zone Pulsed-Field 

Gel Electrophoresis (MZPFGE), the electric field is set 
to different values in two or more spatially distinct 

regions of the gel. The difference in values may be 
related to time dependence, field amplitude or both.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of gel 
electrophoresis, termed multiple-zone pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (MZPFGE), where two or more different 
electric fields are applied to the gel at the same time but 
in distinct spatial regions of the gel. Electrophoresis involves the separation of 
mixtures of molecules by differential migration of the 
molecules through a transport medium in an electric field. 
Many particles in an aqueous medium acquire an electrical 
charge due to ionization and thus move in response to an 
external electrical field. During electrophoresis a 
mixture of macromolecules is eventually separated into a 
series of distinct bands in order of charge density or 
size. Once the bands of molecules are separated they can 
be identified by suitable means such as staining and 
optical scanning. Electrophoresis in a gel medium is an  
 
important method of separating proteins, nucleic acids, and 
other macromolecules in mixture. A given electric field may be altered by 
changing either or both of two parameters: (1) the voltage 
gradient, or intensity of the electric field; or (2) the 
direction, or orientation of the electric field. In 
conventional gel electrophoresis, at any given time a 
single electric field is applied to the gel, i.e., the 
intensity and orientation of the electric field being 
applied to the gel is constant in time throughout the 
electrophoretic separation. In electrophoretic methods for separating large 
double stranded DNA molecules, several techniques have been 
advanced to increase the band resolution (i.e., increase 
the distance between bands without a corresponding increase 
in the width of the bands, or decrease the width of the 
bands without a corresponding decrease in the distance 
between bands). The advantages of pulsing the electric 
field (i.e., periodically changing the field orientation) 
during gel electrophoresis of high molecular weight double-stranded 
DNA was first demonstrated by Schwartz and Cantor.

Patent No. 4,473,452 to Cantor and Schwartz; Gardiner etal., Somatic Cell Mol. Genet., 12, 185 (1986). A number of variants of pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) have been described in the 
literature and are commercially available. In field-inversion 
gel electrophoresis (FIGE) the electric field 
alternates in polarity, and the durations of the "forward" 
and "back" pulses (the pulse amplitudes) are chosen to 
achi
