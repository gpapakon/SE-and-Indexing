Process for pre-heating glass and charges (16) containing organic
additives in an indirect heat exchanger (10), which comprises at

least one pre-heating shaft (11) and a thereto adjacent heating
chamber (12), to maximum temperatures just below the softening

temperature of glass for subsequent placing in a glass melting
furnace (1) whilst guiding the charge (16) in the at least one pre-heating

shaft (11) and by loading the heating chamber (12) with
waste gases from the glass melting furnace (1), 
characterised in
that
 gases and vapours developed from the organic additives are
at least partially introduced from the heat exchanger (10) outside

the glass melt into the glass melting furnace (1).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the release
of the gases and vapours from the organic additives is carried out

at a pressure below that of the environment.
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the charge
(16) in the heat exchanger (10) is guided in the at least one

vertically configured pre-heating shaft (11) from the top to the
bottom, and gases and vapours are vacuumed from the lower

area of this at least one pre-heating shaft (11).
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 water
vapour is vacuumed from the charge (16) at a point of the at least

one pre-heating shaft (11) which is located above the vacuum
point (27) provided for other gases and vapours in the range of a

temperature at which no decomposition of the organic additives
has taken place.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 gases and
vapours released from the charge are fed into combustion air

which is delivered to the glass melting furnace (1).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 gases and
vapours released from the charge (16) are fed into the combustion

chamber of the glass melting furnace (1).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 gases and
vapours released from the charge (16) are fed to at least one

torch (4) of the glass melting furnace (1).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the waste
gases from the glass melting furnace (1) are, prior to entry into the

indirect heat exchanger (10), ducted via a regenerative or
recuperative heat exchanger (8). 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to Claim 1 with
an indirect heat exchanger (10), which comprises at least one pre-heating

shaft (11) to be passed through by the charge (16) and a
heating chamber (12), which is adjacent to and separated from

the pre-heating shaft (11), for passing through a heating medium,
and downstream of the heat exchanger (10) is a glass melting

furnace (1) the waste gas pipe (24) of which is assigned to the
heating chamber (12) of the heat exchanger (10) and the feed

opening (Dog House 3) is connected by a conveying means (20)
to the at least one pre-heating shaft (11), 
characterised in that

the at least one pre-heating shaft (11) is connected to the glass
melting surface (1) via a carbonisation gas pipe (28) outside the

glass melt.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
carbonisation gas pipe (28) is connected to the pre-heating shaft

(11) in the lower area of the heat exchanger.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 a suction
blower (31) is configured in the carbonisation gas pipe (28).
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the at
least one pre-heating shaft (11) is in its upper area connected to a

vacuum pipe (34) for water vapour.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
carbonisation gas pipe (28) terminates in an air delivery opening

(7) for combustion air.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
carbonisation gas pipe (28) is connected to the combustion

chamber of the glass melting furnace (1)
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
carbonisation gas pipe (28) is connected to at least one of the

torches (4) of the glass melting furnace (1).
