<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to room temperature curable
compositions, and preferably, to condensation curing type
compositions which are fast curable, and preferably deeply
curable, at room temperature.Room temperature fast curable organopolysiloxane
compositions of the condensation curing type known in the
art include compositions of one part type comprising a both
end hydroxy-terminated organopolysiloxane as a base polymer
and a crosslinking agent in an amount minimized so as to
increase the crosslinking rate through hydrolysis, and
compositions of two part type wherein a both end hydroxy-terminated
organopolysiloxane as a base polymer and a
crosslinking agent are separately packed.The compositions of one part type, however, are not
regarded as fast curing since they merely have a high curing
rate from the surface and require a certain time for deep
curing. By contrast, the compositions of two part type are
relatively fast in depth curing, but are difficult to handle
on account of a mixing ratio of the two parts departing from
1:1 and thus inapplicable to an automatic mixing dispenser.
In order to drive complete curing to depths, the quantity of
hydroxyl at both ends of organopolysiloxane or
polyoxyalkylene polymer and the quantity of crosslinking
agent added must be strictly controlled, or water must be
further added as a deep curing agent.On the other hand, organopolysiloxane compositions of
the addition curing type are efficient to work with since
the two parts are mixed in a ratio of 1:1. However, the 
working environment is limited since a heating oven is
generally necessary for curing and the curing catalyst can
be poisoned in the presence of an addition poison.To solve these problems, we proposed in USP 5,319,050
a composition comprising a diorganopolysiloxane blocked with
a hydrolyzable silyl group at either end of its molecular
chain, 0.001 to 1 mol of an organic compound having at least
one C=O group in a molecule, and 0.001 to 1 mol of an
organic compound having at least one NH2 group in a
molecule. This is a room temperature fast curable
organopolysiloxane composition which utilizes water formed
as a by-product by ketimine forming reaction between C=O and
NH2 groups. Continuing investigations, we found that when
the diorganopolysiloxane as the base polymer is end-blocked
with a hydrolyzable silyl group, the composition maintains
storage stability etc., but its fast curing property does
not significantly exceed that of conventional well-known two
part type compositions wherein a both end
