<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the brassières 
and particularly to an improved brassière. It is known that, in order to obtain a particular 
effectiveness in both supporting and containing 
the breasts, several types of brassières are 
provided with a so called underwire. This consists 
of a support, made either of metal or a different 
substantially rigid material, arranged at the base 
of the brassière cups, whereby each cup can be 
strained only within the limit of the geometric 
shape imposed by the underwire itself. In such a 
way, the push exerted by the breasts is completely 
borne by the underwire and therefore the containing 
forces act on horizontal planes. The main drawback of the brassières provided 
with an underwire is that they are very uncomfortable 
due to the presence of a substantially rigid 
element pressed on the thorax at the base of the 
breasts. A greater comfort is vice versa ensured by the 
brassières being completely made of fabric but having, 
on the other hand, a poorer supporting and 
containing action. In fact, while a substantially  
 
rigid element like an underwire can bear, through a 
bending, the strain exerted on the fabric of each 
cup, with consequent pulling and compression of the 
internal structure of the underwire, this is not 
possible for the only fabric which can effectively 
bear only pulling stresses. Therefore said pulling 
stresses spread, in a usual brassière, to the whole 
fabric, with both a consequent dispersion of 
them and less effective support and containment of 
the breasts. US 4.324.254 discloses a brassiere without underwire 
which comprises a circumferential stretchable band extending around 
the body of the wearer, when the brassiere is worn. However, this stretchable band does not extend upwards and is not 
connected to the shoulder straps. No breast supporting and containing 
action is performed by said band. It only serves to anchor the 
brassiere to the body of the wearer so as to oppose undesirable 
displacements.  
 Thus the object of the present invention is to 
provide an article of lingerie which is effective 
both in supporting and containing the breasts and, 
at the same time, particularly easy-fitting and 
comfortable to be worn. Such an object is attained by a brassière comprising 
two cups connected to both an elastic band 
and respective shoulder straps, in which each cup 
consists, in its lower and external lateral parts, 
of a continuous band connected at the top to respective shoulder 
straps, said continuous band being

<CLAIMS>
A brassière comprising two cups (1,2) connected 
to both an elastic band (4) and respective 

shoulder straps (7,8), characterized in that each 
cup (1,2) consists, in its lower and lateral external 

parts, of a continuous band (3,3') connected 
at the top to respective shoulder straps (7,8), said 

continuous band (3,3') being made of a low-stretch fabric 
which is less elastic than the remaining fabric of the cups (1,2).  

 
A brassière according to claim 1, characterized 
in that each continuous band (3,3') made of 

low-stretch fabric has a variable width along its 
length. 
A brassière according to claim 1, characterized 
in that each continuous band (3,3') made of 

low-stretch fabric has a greater width in a lower 
part of the respective cup (1,2). 
A brassière according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each cup is limited 

to only the respective continuous band (3,3') 
made of low-stretch fabric. 
A brassière according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the continuous 

bands (3,3') made of low-stretch fabric are linked 
to each other in correspondence with the front zone 

of the elastic band (4), said zone being comprised 
between the cups (1,2).  

 
A brassière according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the continuous 

bands (3,3') are made in "FIBER-FILL" laminated by 
"JERSEY-COTTON".
