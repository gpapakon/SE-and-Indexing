<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an innovation, important for engine research, for compensating the thermal shocks superimposed on the pressure cycles. For this purpose, a diaphragm construction is proposed which consists of an annular plate (14) and a central plate (35), which are connected to an annular carrier (9) in such a way that a bridge bearing structure is produced which has a double-parallelogram support. The central plate, which can be optimised in terms of position and thickness, is used as actuator element for controlling the compensation process via the double-parallelogram structure. At the same time, the central plate is raised to a significantly higher temperature level by means of the controlled thermal conduction paths. As a result of these two measures, an innovative thermal shock compensation is achieved. Additional improvement is possible by means of the stepwise optimisation of the central plate, for example by machine-turning the same and comparing it in the test engine.

Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
structure comprising an outer sleeve (1), a central plate (13)

optimized for the thermoshock compensation effect, an annular
plate (14) joined to the outer sleeve (1) and the central plate

(13), and an annular support (9) joining the central plate (13)
and annular plate (14) to a force transmitting element (10),

so that a cavity (8) bounded by the central plate (13), annular
plate (9) and force transmitting element (10) is formed. The

central plate (13), annular plate (14) and annular support (9)
are joined in such a way that they form a bridge girder

structure.
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
structure according to claim 1, the diaphragm structure being

inclined inwards at an angle a and the annular plate (14) being
jointed elastically to the outer sleeve (1) and the annular

support (9), which is joined to the force transmission element
(10).
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
structure according to one of claims 1 and 2, with the central

plate (13, 35) jointed elastically to the annular support (9)
and on the outside merging flush into the inclined annular plate

(14).
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
structure according to one of claims 1 and 2, with the central

plate (13, 35) jointed rigidly to the annular support (9) and
on the outside merging flush into the inclined annular plate

(14).
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
structure according to one of claims 1 and 2, with the central

plate (27, 32) mounted as a separate part from the front on
the annular support, flush with the annular plate (14) or set

back by the diamension L. 
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
according to one of claims 1 to 4, with the central plate (27,

32) forming one piece together with the annular plate (14) and
annular support (9) and set back by the dimension L, and the

thickness (W) optimized so that the thermoshock error is as
small as possible.
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
according to one of claims 1 to 3, with the articulations (12)

constructed so that an efficient heat barrier against the central
sensor transmission element (10) results, causing the central

plate (13) to assume an increased average temperature so that
the gradients to the cyclic thermal shocks are reduced,

contributing substantially to the thermoshock compensation.
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
according to one of claims 1 to 4, with the annular support

(9) of the central plate (13) welded onto the force transmission
element (10).
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
according to one of claims 1 to 8, with the annular support

(9) of the central plate (13) pressed onto the force transmission
element (10) by mechanical preload.
Thermoshock-compensated pressure transducer diaphragm
according to one of claims 1 to 5, with the central plate (30)

forming part of the metal disk (34) covering the entire front
surface and appropriately supportable by welding spots (31).
Procedure for optimizing the thermoshock compensation of
a pressure transducer diaphragm according to one of claims 1

to 10, whereby the pressure transducer diaphragm structure is
tested in a motor, after which the wall thickness (W) of the

central plate (13) is altered in stages by removing material. 
Procedure for optimizing the thermoshock compensation of
a pressure transducer diaphragm according to one of claims 1

to 10, whereby the pressure transducer diaphragm structure is
tested in a motor and the depth (L) of the setback of the surface

of the central plate (13, 32) from the front surface of the
diaphragm structure is optimized in stages.
