<ABSTRACT>
A full adder circuit having a plurality of full adders 
each provided for each bit, each full adder comprising: a 

calculation block (31a) responsive to a first carry signal 
given by a preceding stage bit as a differential signal 

and two external input data (A1,B1) to be added at a 
present stage bit, for outputting addition data calculated 

on the basis of the first carry signal and the external 
input data as two differential signals, and further 

outputting a second carry signal to a succeeding bit 
as a differential signal indicative of whether a carry is 

generated by the present stage bit or not; and a latch type 
sense amplifier (16a) for outputting an addition result 

(SUM) of the present stage bit, after having differentially 
amplified and latched the addition data outputted by the 

calculation block. Since the addition operation is made on 
the basis of a minute 

potential difference (before amplification), it is possible 
to shorten the required charging time and to reduce the 

current consumption. In addition, since the sense 
amplifiers (16a) are provided with the latch function 

(18a), it is possible to control the differential 
amplification operation and the latch operation on the 

basis of a common sense amplifier activating signal (SAB), 
so that the number of elements can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a full adder circuit,
and more specifically to a full adder circuit for
transmitting a carry signal differentially from a less
significant bit full adder to a more significant bit full
adder.Fig. 1 shows an adder circuit related to the present
invention, in which two carry signals are inputted from a
preceding stage full adder as complementary
differential carry signals; addition data is obtained on
the basis of the carry signals and data to be added; and
the other carry signals are transmitted to a succeeding
stage full adder.In more detail, the complementary carry signals Cin and
/Cin are inputted from the preceding stage full adder to
the present full adder. In this full adder, when the
signal level of the carry signal Cin is higher than that of
the carry signal /Cin, a carry is not generated to the
succeeding stage bit. In contrast with this, when the
signal level of the carry signal Cin is lower than that of
the carry signal /Cin, a carry is generated to the
succeeding stage bit. Between two input terminals for
inputting the carry signals C and /C from the preceding
stage bit and two output terminals for outputting the carry
signals Cout and /Cout to the succeeding stage bit, two
signal lines 131 and 133 are connected to transmit the
carry signals, respectively. Between the two signal lines
131 and 133, two N-channel transistors 127 and 129 are
provided as transfer gates of the signal lines.Before operation, a precharge signal PREC is inputted
to the gates of two N-channel transistors 137 and 139 to
turn on these transistors, so that the signal lines 131 and
133 are precharged to a predetermined level. Further, the
two signal lines 131 and 133 are equalized to the same
potential through an N-channel transistor 142 also turned 
on in response to the precharge signal PREC. In the same
way as above, the precharge signal PREC is inputted to the
gate of an N-channel transistor 135 to turn on this
transistor, so that the two input terminal for inputting
the carry signals Cin and /Cin are equalized to the same
potential through this N-channel transistor 135. After
that, the transistors 137 and 139 are both turned off to
execute the addition operation.In the present stage bit, two data A and B are added.
When both data are at the logical [1] level, a carry must
be generated to the succeeding stage bit, irrespective of
the carry signals Cin and /Cin applied by the lower
significant bit. In this case, an EX-OR circuit 116 (to
which two input data A and B are applied) outputs
