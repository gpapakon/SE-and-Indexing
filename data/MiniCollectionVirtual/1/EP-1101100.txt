<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring the concentration of hydrogen in a gas mixture, especially in the air, which makes up the atmosphere of an enclosed space. The device comprises a detector (1) which is in contact with said gas mixture, whereby the detector (1) is connected to calculating and display means (2), whereby said detector (1) comprises a catalyst (13) which can cause an exothermic reaction with hydrogen contained in the gas mixture, in addition to comprising conducting means (14) fixed to said catalyst in order to transfer, essentially by conduction, thermal energy which is generated by said reaction from the catalyst (13) to a cold point (18), and also comprising means for measuring the temperature T1 (T21) of the catalyst and the temperature T2 (22) of the cold point (18), whereby said measuring means are connected to means for calculating the value of the molar concentration of hydrogen in the gas mixture on the basis of the measured temperature (T1-T2) gradient, whereby said calculating means supply the hydrogen concentration value to said display means.
