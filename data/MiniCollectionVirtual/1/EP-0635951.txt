<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit for a multiplexer includes two 
inverters, and exclusive-NOR gate, and a d-type flip-flop. 

The multiplexer has two input terminals and two 
selection terminals, and the control circuit has two 

input terminals. One of the two inverters is connected 
in circuit between one of the two control circuit input 

terminals and one of the two multiplexer input terminals; 
the d-type flip-flop is coupled to the two multiplexer 

selection terminals; the exclusive-NOR gate is connected 
in circuit between the two control circuit input 

terminals and two of three input terminals of the d-type 
flip-flop; and the second inverter is connected in 

circuit between the exclusive-NOR gate and one of the 
three input terminals of the d-type flip-flop.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to our following patent 
applications: 
The present invention relates to multiplexers. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to multiplexers that may be 
called upon in operation to shift between unrelated inputs. Multiplexing means transmitting a large number of information 
units over a smaller number of channels or lines. A digital 
multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects binary information 
from one of many input lines and directs it to a single output line. 
The selection of a particular input line is controlled by a set of 
selection lines. Normally, there are 2n input lines and n selection 
lines whose bit combinations determine which input is selected.  It is well known to those skilled in the art to combine several 
relatively low-bit-rate signals to form one relatively high-bit-rate 
signal to be transmitted over a high-frequency medium. Multiplexing is 
considered useful, generally, because it allows multiple signalling 
lines or channels that could not otherwise use the full capacity of a 
given data link to share that capacity, and therefore promote system 
efficiency. In the multiplexing arts, it is possible that all channels will 
have identical bit rates. In such a case it is known to perform 
multiplexing on a bit-by-bit basis (known as bit or digital 
interleaving). It is also known in such a case to perform multiplexing 
on a word-by-word basis (known as byte or word interleaving). In such 
schemes, when the bit rate of incoming channels is not  
 
equal, the high-bit-rate channel may be allocated 
proportionately more slots. Further, it is evident that 
the minimum length of the multiplexer frame must be a 
multiple of the lowest common multiple of the incoming 
channel bit rates and, hence, such schemes are practical 
only when some fairly simple relationship exists among 
these rates. Upon receipt at a destination terminal, the 
multiplexed digit stream must be divided and distributed 
to the appropriate output channel. To accomplish this, 
the destination or receiving terminal must be able to 
correctly identify each bit. This requires the receiving 
system to synchronize with the beginning of each frame, 
with each slot in each frame, and with each bit in each 
slot. This may be accomplished by adding "control bits" 
(e.g., framing bits and synchronization bits) to the data 
bits. As those skilled in the art are well aware, 
synchronization between all of the incoming channels and 
the multiplexer cannot be presumed. It is
