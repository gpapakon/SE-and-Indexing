<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotation-resistant wire rope of the all-steel type, consisting of an outer strand ply and of a rope core stranded in the opposite direction to this. The outer strand ply 1 consists of 11 - 13 individual strands 2 which themselves consist of a core wire 3 and of a wire ply 4. The rope core 5 consists of a single central core strand which is composed of at least three wire plies 7, 8, 9 which are themselves stranded about a central element 6.

Low-rotating wire rope made entirely of steel comprising an outer strand layer and a
stranded rope core opposite thereto,

characterized in that

the outer strand layer (1) comprises 11 - 13 single strands (2) which in turn are
comprised of a core wire (3) and a layer of wires (4),
the rope core (5) is formed from parallel lay strands or parallel lay compound
strands having at least three layers wherein the minimum of three wire layers (7, 8,

9) are stranded around a central element (6) and
the diameter of the wires in said outer wire layers (9) in said rope core (5) exceeds
the diameter of the outer wire of said single strands (2) in said outer strand layer

(1) by a maximum of 100 %.
A low-rotating wire rope in accordance with Claim 1, characterized in that said single
strands (2) and/or said rope core (5) is thickly packed.
A low-rotating wire rope in accordance with Claim 2, characterized in that the diameter
of the wires in said outer wire layers (9) in said rope core (5) corresponds to the

diameter of the outer wires in said single strands (2) in said outer strand layer (1) prior
to compaction in the ratio indicated in Claim 1.
A low-rotating wire rope in accordance with one of Claims 1 - 3, characterized in that
said rope core (5) is provided with a coating of plastic material.
