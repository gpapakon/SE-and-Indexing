Illumination arrangement for an optical system, preferably a microlithographic projection
exposure system, with a reticle masking system (51),

characterized in that

a glass rod (5) is provided for homogenization of light and that the reticle masking system
(51) is arranged at an intermediate field plane at the exit end of the glass rod (5).
Illumination arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that an objective (2) with
an axicon (24) is arranged between light source (1) and glass rod (5).
Illumination arrangement according to claim 2 with two axicons, characterized in that
conventional illumination as well as annular aperture- and multipole-illumination can be

adjusted in a stepless manner.
Illumination arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that an arrangement is
provided between light source (1') and glass rod (7') for alternatively providing different

illumination modi, including conventional illumination with adjustable factor of coherence
(Ïƒ), annular aperture illumination and symmetrical off-axis illumination from two or four

directions, comprising

means (21'-24') for separately receiving light fluxes from two or four spatial angle
zones of the light flux emitted by the light source (1')
means (31'-34') for forming or stopping down the received light fluxes,
a mirror arrangement (511'-514', 521'-524', 531'-533'; 6') for imaging the light
fluxes onto sectors of a pupil plane (93'), which is conjugated to the reticle plane for the

reticle (10') to be imaged,
displacing means (541'-544') such that the images of the light fluxes can be shifted
radially and azimuthally in the pupil plane (93').
Illumination arrangement according to claim 4, characterized in that the means for
receiving (21'-24') or the means for forming (31'-34') or stopping down the received light

fluxes comprise light conductors (31'-34'). 
Illumination arrangement according to claim 5, characterized in that the displacing means
(541'-544') displace the positions of the exits of the light conductors (31'-34').
Illumination arrangement according to claim 4, characterized in that the displacing means
(541'-544') displace parts of the mirror arrangement (511'-533').
Illumination arrangement according to at least one of claims 4-7, characterized in that the
images of the light fluxes in the pupil plane (93') are dimensioned such that they are

suitable for the symmetrical oblique illumination or for the conventional illumination
without of a scanning movement.
Illumination arrangement according to at least one of the claims 4-8, characterized in that
means for changing the magnitude of the images of the light fluxes are provided.
Illumination arrangement according to at least one of the claims 4-9, characterized in that
means for changing the shape of the light fluxes are provided.

exposure system according to claims 1, 2 or 3 with two axicons, characterized in that the

two axicons follow each other directly in the beam path and that their distance is
adjustable, that one axicon is concave and a second axicon is convex and that the tips of

both axicons direct in the same direction.
Illumination arrangement according to claim 13, characterized in that the axicons (22, 23)
have the same top angle (a) as far as feasible in production and effective in function. 
Illumination arrangement according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in that the distance
