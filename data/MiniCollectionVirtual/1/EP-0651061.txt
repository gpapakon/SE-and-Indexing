<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing grain-oriented magnetic steel strip which is readily magnetisable in four directions in the rolling plane and to magnet cores for rotary (rotating) and non-rotary (non-rotating) electrical machines (electric machinery). The process is characterised in that steel slabs having a C content of 
<
 0.10% and an Si content of from 0 to 2% and contents of Al, Mn, S, N, O in the concentrations usual for magnetic steel strip are preheated to about 1250 DEG C, are roughed (cogged, bloomed) in from 5 to 9 passes with small reductions for each individual pass and are finish-rolled in a separate roll line, with an entrance temperature of from 930 DEG C to 1100 DEG C and a finishing temperature of from 800 DEG C to 950 DEG C, with reductions per pass of 35%, and the hot strip thus produced is reeled without forced cooling (controlled cooling, ducted cooling) at a temperature of 
>
 700 DEG C and after cooling, while an amount of deformation (a degree of deformation) of 
>
 86% is maintained, is subjected to cold working (cold forming) which is followed by an interannealing stage under a neutral gas at from 500 DEG C to 750 DEG C for from 0.5 h to 20 h and further cold working at from 2 to 15% and subsequent final annealing at temperatures around 800 DEG C in an at least intermittently decarburising atmosphere.

Process for producing grain-oriented magnetic
steel strip which is readily magnetizable in four

directions in the rolling plane, in which steel slabs
having a C content of 
<
0.10% and an Si content of from
0 to 2% and contents of Al, Mn, S, N, O in the

concentrations which are usual for magnetic steel strip
are preheated to approximately 1250°C, are roughed in

from 5 to 9 passes with small reductions for each
individual pass and are finish-rolled in a separate

roll line, with an entry temperature of from 930°C to
1100°C and a finishing temperature of from 800°C to

950°C, with reductions for each pass of (35%, and the
hot strip produced in this way is coiled without forced

cooling at a temperature of 
>
700°C and, after cooling,
while a degree of deformation of 
>
86% is maintained, is
subjected to cold working which is followed by

intermediate annealing under neutral gas at from 500°C
to 750°C for from 0.5 h to 20 h and further cold

working of from 2 to 15% with subsequent final
annealing at temperatures of around 800°C in an at

least intermittently decarburizing atmosphere.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, in the case of unalloyed steel, the

temperature on entry into the finishing roll line is

<
1000°C and on exit from the finishing roll line is
from 840°C to 870°C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, in the case of steel, the temperature on entry

into the finishing roll line is from 1000°C to 1100°C
and on exit from the finishing roll line is up to

920°C.
Process according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that expediently, before cold working,

the hot strip is preheated to a temperature of from
150°C to 350°C, preferably to 200°C to 300°C.
Process according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the unalloyed magnetic steel

strip, after cold rolling, is subjected to intermediate
annealing, preferably at 520°C to 580°C for one to five

hours under neutral gas.
Process according to Claims 1 and 3,
characterized in that the alloyed magnetic steel strip,

after cold rolling, is subjected to intermediate
annealing, preferably at from 620°C to 680°C for one to

five hours under neutral gas.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the cold-rolled magnetic steel

strip is skin-rolled at 2-15% and undergoes final
annealing intermittently in a decarburizing atmosphere,

the magnetic steel strip, if appropriate, being
subjected to further rerolling and final annealing.
Process for producing magnet cores for
electrical machines from grain-oriented magnetic steel

strip which is produced according to one of Claims 1 to
7 and is readily magnetizable in four directions in the

rolling plane, in which process the stamped parts which
are to be produced for the magnet cores are stamped out

taking into account the course of the four directions
of ready magnetizability, which run at 45° to the

direction of rolling, and are combined to form an
assembly.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the stamped parts for magnet cores for rotary

to form an assembly in such a way that core plates

which immediately follow one another are arranged
rotated through 45° with respect to one another.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the stamped parts for magnet cores for rotary

electrical machines comprise segments which are
combined to form an assembly in such a way that the

individual segments each pick up the directions of
ready magnetizability.
