<ABSTRACT>
An optical detection system for detecting rain 
or other water droplets (30) on the outer surface of a window (12) 

and for detecting fog on the inner surface of such 
window with a single photo-detector (14) is disclosed. The 

optical detection method and apparatus of the invention 
measures the accumulation of water droplets on the 

window (12) by light refraction of a first light beam (20,22) with 
such droplets to redirect a first light beam (20,22) to the 

photo-detector (14). A masking device (26) prevents such first 
light beam from reaching the photo-detector directly 

without refraction (18). As a result the rain measurement 
output signal of the photo-detector (14) increases with an 

increasing accumulation of water droplets on the window (12). 
The fog accumulation is measured by a second light beam (36) 

reflected off the inner surface of the window to the 
photo-detector (14) so that the fog measurement output signal 

of the photo-detector (14) decreases with increasing amounts 
of fog since such fog scatters and diffuses the light to 

reduce the amount of light reflected to the photo-detector. 
A third light source (40) is focused directly on 

the photo-detector (14) to bias it into an operating point of 
high sensitivity to infrared light and is connected in a 

negative feedback circuit from the output of the photo-detector 
amplifier. The photo-detector output is 

connected to a narrowband amplifier that is tuned to the 
frequency of an oscillator which pulses the first and 

second light sources at different times. As a result of 
this negative feedback, changes in the output signal of 

the photo-detector (14) due to external factors such as 
temperature changes or aging of the light sources (10,34,40) and 

photo-detector (14), as well as changes in the supply voltage 
and ambient light are cancelled so they do not produce 

errors in the measurement signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of the present invention
relates generally to optical detection of water and in
particular to optical detection of water droplets on a
window, such as the windshield of an automobile or other
vehicle using light refraction. A light beam is
transmitted through the water droplets which refract the
light beam to a photo-detector which produces an
electrical measurement signal at the output of the
photo-detector corresponding to the amount of water
accumulation on the window. The apparatus and method of
the present invention is especially useful for detecting
moisture, including rain drops and fog or other
precipitation on the windshield of automobiles or other
vehicles in order to operate windshield wipers, heaters,
fans and other devices for removing such rain and fog to
improve the visibility through such windshield or for
operating other devices such as motors for closing
convertible tops, sunroofs, or other windows in the
event of rain when the vehicle is left unattended.It has previously been proposed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,131,834 to Blaszkowski, issued December 26, 1978,
to provide moisture detectors based upon measuring
changes in electrical conductivity between spaced
electrodes which sense rain when the gap between such
electrodes is bridged by the rainwater. However, the
amount of conductivity varies with atmospheric
contaminants in the water as well as corrosion and wear
of the electrical contacts forming the electrodes.
Therefore such moisture detectors do not provide
accurate measurement of the amount of moisture present.In addition, moisture detectors have been
proposed for detecting moisture based on measuring the
changing capacitance in the gap between spaced
electrodes due to changes in the dielectric material of
such gap, such as when water is present. However, such 
a moisture detector suffers from poor sensitivity due to
the proximity effects of moving wiper blades on such
capacitance and from interfering electrical fields from
power lines and other sources.It has also been proposed to detect moisture by
sensing the sound created by infringing droplets but
this is inaccurate and is unable to detect light mists
or fog accumulations. Similarly, moisture detectors
based upon measurement of the mass changes due to the
presence of water droplets are insensitive to light mist
or fog.Some optical detectors have sensed moisture
based upon the interruption of light beam by the water
droplets. However, these detectors also are insensitive
to gradual accumulations of moisture as
