<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the hydroxycarbonylation of lactones, more precisely of the various valerolactones and their isomers, by reaction with carbon monoxide and water, in order to form the corresponding diacid. More precisely, it consists in reacting carbon monoxide and water with at least one lactone having 5 carbon atoms, the reaction being carried out in the presence of an effective amount of an iridium catalyst and of an iodine-containing or bromine-containing promoter, the promoter/Ir molar ratio being between 0.1/1 and 20/1. This process especially makes it possible to value-enhance gamma-valerolactone to adipic acid.
