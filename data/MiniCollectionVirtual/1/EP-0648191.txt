<ABSTRACT>
A reactor for the biological treatment of water comprises a reactor vessel (1), a fermentation chamber (3) bounded in said vessel, means (10) for introducing influent into the fermentation chamber, a settling chamber (4) above the top boundary (2) of the fermentation chamber (3), for separating out sludge from treated water, a downer (5) extending downwards from the settling chamber through the fermentation chamber, for returning separated-out sludge to the fermentation chamber (3), and means (11) for discharging effluent from the settling chamber. In order to improve and accelerate the separation of sludge from effluent in a simple manner, at least one supply line (8a, 9a, 17) opens out tangentially into the settling chamber. A whirlpool is produced in the settling chamber by means of said supply line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reactor for the biological treatment of 
water, comprising a reactor vessel, a fermentation chamber bounded in 
said vessel, means for introducing influent into the fermentation 
chamber, a settling chamber above the top boundary of the fermentation 
chamber, for separating out sludge from treated water, said settling 
chamber having an outer boundary formed as a body of revolution, at 
least one supply line for liquid and/or gas opening into the settling 
chamber, a downer extending downwards from the settling chamber 
through the fermentation chamber for returning separated-out sludge to 
the fermentation chamber and means for discharging effluent from the 
settling chamber. Such a reactor is disclosed in EP-A-0213012. It can be used for 
aerobic or anaerobic treatment of water. A driving force for the downward flow of recirculation water end 
sludge is obtained by producing a gas lift effect in such a treatment 
(in which case the gas-containing liquid outside the downer is lighter 
than the non-gas-containing liquid in the downer. The object of the invention is to provide a simple way of improving 
the separation out of sludge from effluent and also the circulation in 
the reactor. According to the invention, for this purpose the reactor is 
characterized in that the discharge end of said supply line for liquid 
and/or gas has a tangential direction, perpendicular to the radius as 
seen in a plane perpendicular to the axis of said settling chamber, 
for producing a whirlpool in said settling chamber. The whirlpool effect arising through the tangential supply of gas into 
the settling chamber gives an additional driving force to the downward 
flow of separated-out sludge and recirculation water. The sludge 
separation itself is improved.  
 Where the reactor is intended for anaerobic water purification, the 
supply line opening out tangentially into the settling chamber is a 
pipe for liquid and biogas. In that case it is connected to the 
fermentation chamber. Where the reactor is intended for aerobic water purification, the 
supply line opening out tangentially into the settling chamber is an 
air of oxygen pipe. The gas inlet line opening out into the settling chamber can be 
situated with its outlet end in a space which is separated by a 
cylindrical partition from the tangential inlet of the effluent 
discharge means. An additional improvement of the downward flow in the downer can also 
be achieved it the means for introducing influent at least partially 
consist of
