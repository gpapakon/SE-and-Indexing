<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of telecommunication switches (22,24,26) are coupled to 
agent communication terminals (ACTs) (36A,B,C) which are used by agents for 

handling incoming calls. An integrated control system (46,48,52) is coupled to the 
ACTs and controls the distribution of incoming calls among the ACTs. An 

intelligent node in the system can access an agent queue (in 46) that stores data 
indicating availability of ACTs to handle the call and a call queue (in 46) which 

stores data concerning calls waiting for ACD service. A database stores processing 
instructions for the handling of incoming calls based on data contained in the agent 

and call queues, and subscriber specified instructions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to the automatic distribution of 
incoming telephone calls and more specifically, addresses a telecommunication 
network which integrates the control of such calls as part of the general call routing 
function. Various types of conventional automatic distributors (ACDs) are 
available to distribute incoming calls to a subscriber. Reservation and information 
services may be provided by large companies, such as major airlines, and may 
consist of geographically separated groups of agents which answer incoming calls 
distributed to the agents by separate ACDs. Agent communication terminals (ACTs) 
which are connected to an ACD are utilized by the agents to process incoming calls 
routed to a particular ACT by the ACD. A public branch exchange (PBX) type ACD such as a Definity® ACD 
available from AT&T functions as a conventional PBX and further functions as an 
ACD to distribute incoming calls to local agents connected to the PBX. Another 
type of ACD consists of the utilization of an electronic telecommunication switch 
such as a 5ESS® switch available from AT&T which is capable of providing ACD 
service when supported by ACTs coupled to the switch. Both types of ACD 
typically function as independent systems which handle incoming calls and make 
internal decisions concerning which agent will receive a given call. Both types of 
ACD systems are capable of generating statistical reports which can be monitored by 
a work station coupled to the ACD system to allow a supervisor to monitor call 
handling statistics. Such data typically represents an average of statistics for a given 
system. U.S. Patent 4,737,983 to Frauenthal et al. addresses a method of 
balancing traffic loads to a plurality of customer ACDs. Each ACD periodically 
transmits call congestion data representing an accumulation of data for the ACD to a 
central database. Based on this data, the database determines a preferred ACD to 
which to route an incoming call. Although this technique may be generally 
sufficient for balancing certain traffic loads, it relies on accumulated or aggregate 
data on which to base decisions and, hence does not permit specific agents, i.e. 
ACTs, to be identified to receive a call.  In U.S. Patent 4,953,204 to Cuschleg, Jr. et al. a method is described for 
queuing calls to a multi-location service provider having a plurality of ACDs. 
Decisions on routing a call to the ACD is based on the availability of a non-busy 
voice channel to the ACD. If all channels (circuits) are
