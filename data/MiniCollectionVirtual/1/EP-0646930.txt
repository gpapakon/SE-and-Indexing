<ABSTRACT>
An associative memory is capable of erasing on a 
batch basis only unnecessary data. There are provided a 

first flag indicative of whether or not effective data is 
stored and a second flag indicative of whether or not a match 

is detected, corresponding to the associated one of the word 
memories. The first flags are reset on a batch basis in 

accordance with the state of the associated second flags.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a content
addressable memory or an associative memory comprising
a number of word memories each for storing data, and
having such a function that match or mismatch between
data stored in word memories and retrieval data
inputted to the word memories is retrieved.Recently, there has been proposed an associative
memory provided with the retrieval function as
mentioned above.Fig. 4 is a circuit block diagram of the
conventional associative memory by way of example.Referring to Fig. 4, an associative memory 10 is
provided with a number of word memories 11a, 11b, ... ,
llm each consisting of a 5-bit series of memory cells
by way of example. Further, the associative memory 10
comprises a retrieval register 12 which is arranged to
receive and latch a word of retrieval data. A bit
pattern of the retrieval data latched in the retrieval
register 12 in its entirety or in a part specified is
compared with a bit pattern of the portion
corresponding to the bit pattern of the latched
retrieval data with respect to data stored in each of
the word memories 11a, 11b, ..., 11m. As a result of
the comparison, if there are found any of the word
memories 11a,11b,..., 11m of which the bit pattern
matches with that of the retrieval data, a match signal
given by a logic "1" will appear on the associated ones
of match lines 14a, 14b, ..., 14m which are provided in
conjunction with the word memories 11a, 11b, ..., 11m,
respectively. On the other hand, a mismatch signal 
given by a logic "0" will appear on the remaining ones
of the match lines 14a, 14b, ..., 14m.Assuming that the signals "0", "1", "0", "0", "1"
..., "0" appear on the match lines 14a, 14b,..., 14m,
respectively, these signals are applied to a priority
encoder 15. The priority encoder 15 is so arranged to
output an address signal AD corresponding to the match
line given with a highest priority among the match
lines (here, two match lines 14b and 14e) on which the
match signal given by a logic "1" appears. Supposing
that the priority is in alphabetical order of a suffix
of the reference character, in this case, the match
line 14b is selected as the highest priority match
line. Thus, the priority encoder 15 outputs
an address signal AD corresponding to the highest
priority match line 14b, which address signal AD is
applied to an address decoder 16, as occasion demands.
The address decoder 16 decodes the received address
signal AD and outputs an access signal (here a signal
given by a logic "1") to the associated one (here a
word line
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An associative memory comprising a plurality of
word memories (11) each for storing data, and a

plurality of match detection circuits (53) each
corresponding to an associated one of said plurality of

word memories, for detecting a match or mismatch
between data stored in the associated word memory and

entered retrieval data, further comprising:

a plurality of first flag registers (51) each
corresponding to an associated one of said plurality of

word memories (11), for storing a first flag indicative
of whether the associated word memory is in a first

storage state such that effective data as an object of
retrieval is stored therein or in a second storage

state such that the effective data is not stored
therein and thus overwriting is permitted;

characterised by:

a plurality of second flag registers (55) each
corresponding to an associated one of said plurality of

word memories (11), for storing a second flag
indicative of whether the associated word memory is in

a first historical state such that the associated word
memory was subject to a match detection at least once

in past retrievals since a start of operation, or in a
second historical state such that the associated word

memory was not subject to a match detection in past
retrievals since the start of operation; and
a storage state alteration circuit (58,59,61,64)
for altering on a batch basis some or all of the word

memories from the first storage state to the second
storage state in dependence on the contents of the

associated second flag registers (55).
An associative memory according to claim 1,
wherein said storage state alteration circuit includes

means (61, 594) for placing on a batch basis all of the
word memories into the second storage state. 
An associative memory according to claim 1
or 2, further comprising a historical state reset means

(56) for causing said plurality of second flag
registers (55) to store on a batch basis the second

flags indicative of the second historical state,
thereby defining the start of operation.
