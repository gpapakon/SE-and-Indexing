<ABSTRACT>
The contact carrier for multiple wiring of printed circuit boards or the like is characterised in that its means for insulation-piercing terminal wiring comprise at least one button (2) which can be pushed down on the contact carrier (1) and has pressure projections (3) on the contact side, which penetrate into the wire insertion slot (4) of the contact carrier (1) when the button (2) is pressed down onto said carrier (1) and force the inserted wires (10) into the insulation piercing terminals (5) of the contact solder tabs (6). In consequence, the problem of exerting pressure on the wires or conductors is comprehensively solved despite very confined spatial conditions.
