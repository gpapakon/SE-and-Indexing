<ABSTRACT>
α-cyanoacrylate adhesive compositions in which refractory 
elastomer particles of 0.1 to 100 µm in particle size are 

dispersed in cyanoacrylate adhesive, and a method for 
production of the adhesive compositions. Adhesive 

compositions can be improved in brittleness after 
hardened, having higher adhesive strength, impact 

resistance and peel strength in comparison with compatible 
type adhesive, and show remarkably excellent durability 

(heat resistance, water resistance, moisture resistance, 
and thermal shock resistance) by dispersing excessive 

refractory elastomer particles in α-cyanoacrylate 
adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to α-cyanoacrylate adhesive
compositions having excellent properties such as high peel
strength, impact resistance, heat resistance, moisture
resistance, and thermal shock resistance, and a method for
production of the α-cyanoacrylate adhesive compositions
by dispersing refractory elastomer particles such as
acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer in α-cyanoacrylate
adhesive.Cyanoacrylate is a compound expressed by the following
general formula. (In the formula, R represents components
having carbon number of 16 or less such as alkyl, alkenyl,
aralkyl, alkoxy alkyl, haloalkyl, cyclohexyl, allyl, and
phenyl.)
When this compound is applied to a surface of metal,
rubber, plastic, glass and wood, it quickly hardens by
taking place polymerization reaction with a little moisture on
the surface. The compound of this type has an excellent
adhesive property and has been widely used as rapid-setting
adhesive.The α-cyanoacrylate adhesive shows high adhesive strength
under shear; nevertheless, it suffers from the defect that
it becomes brittle when hardened. Thus, the hardened
α-cyanoacrylate adhesive is insufficient in resistance
against peeling stress and impact and durability (heat
resistance, water resistance, moisture resistance, and
thermal shock resistance).Japanese Patent Application Public Disclosure No. SHO 
57-78469(A) discloses a method for improving the
properties of α-cyanoacrylate adhesive such as resistance
against peeling stress and impact by adding pyrogallol to
α-cyanoacrylate in the range of 1 to 5000 ppm. Though
the prior art method makes it possible to improve the
adhesive strength and impact resistance of the adhesive
resultantly obtained, the hardened adhesive entails a
problem such as insufficiency of heat resistance, water
resistance and moisture resistance, and therefore, it is
restricted in use.United States Patent 4,105,715 discloses a cyanoacrylate
adhesive composition in thixotropic paste form made by mixing
a liquid cyanoacrylate ester with powdered organic fillers
selected from (i) polycarbonates, (ii) polyvinylidene
fluorides, (iii) polyethylenes, and (iv) acrylic block
copolymers containing saturated elastomer segments. The
filler is added in proportions of 2.5 to 50% by weight for the
purpose of thickening the basic cyanoacrylate to improve its
handling characteristics.Similarly, International Patent Application No WO 86/01276
discloses a thixotropic gel composition comprising an α-cyano
acrylate in admixture with, among other things, a filler in
the form of

<CLAIMS>
An α-cyanoacrylate adhesive composition comprising an
α-cyanoacrylate adhesive having dispersed therethrough

elastomer particles of size in the range 0.1 to 100 µm,
characterised in that said elastomer particles are selected

from one or more of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer,
styrene-butadiene copolymer or crude rubber.
A method for producing an α-cyanoacrylate adhesive
composition characterised by the steps of:


(a) adding to an α-cyanoacrylate adhesive an excess of
elastomer particles selected from one or more of

acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, styrene-butadiene
copolymer or crude rubber, said elastomer

particles having a solubility of 10% or less in
α-cyanoacrylate at 30°C or below;
(b) heating the mixture obtained in step (a) at 100°C
or below to dissolve the elastomer particles;
(c) rapidly cooling the solution to 20°C to 30°C to
educe elastomer particles in the size range 0.1 to

100 µm, and
(d) dispersing said educed elastomer particles through
said α-cyanoacrylate adhesive.
A method as for producing an α-cyanoacrylate adhesive
composition characterised by the steps of:


(a) dissolving elastomer particles selected from one or
more of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, styrene-butadiene

copolymer or crude rubber in a non-polar
solvent to obtain an elastomer solution;
(b) mixing said elastomer solution with α-cyanoacrylate
adhesive to obtain a mixture; 
(c) subjecting said mixture to vacuum deaeration for
removing said non-polar solvent, thereby educing

elastomer particles in the size range 0.1 to
100 µm, and
(d) dispersing said educed elastomer particles through
said α-cyanoacrylate adhesive.
