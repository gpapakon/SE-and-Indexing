<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF TREATING OPHTHALMIC DISORDERS USING TGF-βField of the InventionThis invention is a method for treating a variety of ophthalmic disorders in which wound healing is impaired or requires modulation, including macular holes, macular degeneration, retinal detachment and tears, retinal edema, retinal vascular disorders, retinal neovascularization, wound healing disorders, proliferative disorders, anti-degenerative disorders, anti-angiogenesis disorders, dry eye syndromes, uveitis, secondary cataracts, corneal epithelial wounds, corneal neovascularization, Sjδgren's syndrome, and surgical wounds. The method entails application of Transforming Growth Factor-j8 (TGF-3) to the affected region. TGF-32 is the preferred form of TGF-/3. Other growth factors which have wound healing and neurotrophic effects may also be applied.Background of the Invention Major ophthalmic disorders affect the retina, lens and cornea. Among the most important retinal disorders are macular holes and degeneration, retinal tears, diabetic retinopathy, and miscellaneous disorders. The most important disorders of the lens are cataracts and refractive errors. The most important disorders of the cornea are those related to corneal defects, including corneal ulcers and wounds and the consequences of dry eye / Sjόgren's syndrome. These are discussed briefly below. 

Retinal PhvsioloσvThe retina is the light-sensitive portion of the eye. Supported by the choroid and retinal pigment cells and found at the posterior of the eye, the retina contains the cones and rods which detect colors. When the rods and cones are excited, they transmit signals which pass through successive neurons in the retina to the optic nerve and finally to the cerebral center, where a "visual picture" is integrated. In the center of the retina is the macula lutea, which is about 1/3 to 1/2 cm in diameter. The macula provides detailed vision, particularly in the center (the fovea) , because the cones are higher in density. Blood vessels, ganglion cells, inner nuclear layer and cells, and the plexiform layers are all displaced to one side (rather than resting above the cones) , thereby allowing light a more direct path to the cones.Under the retina are the choroid, a collection of blood vessels embedded within a fibrous tissue, and the deeply pigmented epithelium, which overlays the choroid layer. The choroidal blood vessels provide nutrition to the retina (particularly its visual cells) .Retinal DisordersThere are a variety of retinal disorders, whose current
