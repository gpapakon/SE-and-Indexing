substrates, a liquid crystal layer 

between the pair of substrates, and an 
electrode for applying a voltage to the liquid crystal 

layer. The liquid crystal layer includes a plurality of regions (A,A') 
having different twist angles (Θ₁,Θ₂) from one another. 
In another embodiment the regions have different reference 
orientation directions and different surface areas. 
In still another embodiment the different reference orientation 
directions are so set that the LC molecules in an area surrounding a 

pixel and close to an electrode line are pretilted in the same direction 
in which they are raised by an electric field generated by the electrode 

line. 
In still further another embodiment the liquid crystal molecules have 
different pretilt angles at the surfaces of the substrates. 
In yet another ambodment at least one alignment film includes an area 
for aligning the liquid crystal molecules horizontally with respect to 

the substrate and an area for aligning the liquid crystal molecules 
vertically with respect to the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display device and a method for producing the
same, and in particular to a liquid crystal display
device having improved display characteristics including
an improved viewing angle performance and a method
for producing such a liquid crystal display device.Liquid crystal display devices (hereinafter,
referred to as "LCD devices") are used in, for example,
planar display apparatuses for personal computers and
the like, liquid crystal TVs, and portable display
apparatuses. Most of the LCD devices currently used
are TN (twisted nematic) type LCD devices (hereinafter,
referred to as "TN LCD devices"). A TN LCD device
includes a liquid crystal layer sandwiched between a
pair of substrates located opposite to each other. The
liquid crystal layer includes liquid crystal molecules
therein. The orientation direction of the liquid
crystal molecules is changed by an electric field and
thus the birefringence of the liquid crystal layer is
changed, thereby performing display.Figure 1 is a partial cross sectional view of
a liquid crystal panel of a conventional TN LCD device.
The liquid crystal panel is an element which performs
actual display in an LCD device. As is shown in Figure
1, the liquid crystal panel includes a pair of substrates
131 and 132 located opposite to each other, and
a liquid crystal layer 133 having liquid crystal molecules 
133a disposed therebetween. The liquid crystal
layer 133 includes liquid crystal molecules 133a therein.
The substrate 131 includes a base 131a, an electrode
131b and an alignment layer 131c laminated in
this order. The substrate 132 includes a base 132a,
an electrode 132b and an alignment layer 132c laminated
in this order. Initially, the liquid crystal molecules
133a are tilted at a pretilt angle δ relative to the
substrates 131 and 132, and the orientation direction
of the liquid crystal molecules 133a is twisted at
approximately 90° from the substrate 132 to the substrate
131 (twist angle t = 90°). The alignment
layers 131c and 132c are provided in order to put the
liquid crystal molecules in such an initial orientation
direction. For the alignment layers, polyimide treated
by rubbing is widely used.When a voltage is applied to each of the
electrodes 131b and 132b, an electric field is applied
in a direction perpendicular to the substrates 131 and
132. The liquid crystal molecules 133a are erected by
the dielectric anisotropy thereof to be parallel to the
direction of the electric field. Thus, the birefringence
of the
