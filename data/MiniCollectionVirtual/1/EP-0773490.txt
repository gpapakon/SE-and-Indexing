<ABSTRACT>
A security system for protecting information 
stored in portable storage media operates by checking identifiers 

assigned to each medium, system, and terminal. Medium IDs 
are identifiers written by manufacturers of the storage 

media. System IDs, or corporate IDs, are assigned to 
enterprise-wide computer systems each consisting of a host 

computer and terminals. Terminal IDs are affixed to the 
respective terminals. Data is stored in the media in 

encrypted form. The security system checks the validity 
of the medium ID, (S22), system ID (S23) and terminal ID (S24) 

before allowing the user to perform any data access, thus 
protecting the contents from unauthorized access. The 

security system also writes permission data into each 
storage medium to manage the decryption of encrypted data 

stored therein. The permission data contains an encrypted 
key which is necessary for decrypting the data
, and the 
key can be decoded only with a valid medium ID and unit ID, 

thus protecting the data in the medium against any attempt 
to decrypt it with unqualified equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a security system
for protecting information stored in storage
media and in a specific example, to a security system for
protecting information stored in portable storage media.The
present invention also relates to a security system for
protecting data stored in storage media by using
cryptography.Today's mass storage device technologies allow a
large amount of information to be stored in a handy
storage medium and new high-capacity media, such as
magneto-optical (MO) disks, are used for delivering data
and programs on an off-line basis. In business computer
systems in which a plurality of terminals are connected to
a host computer via communications networks, executive
programs for the terminals, as well as data processed in
daily jobs, are stored in those portable storage media and
transported from headquarters to terminals or vice versa.
Besides being capable of storing large-volume files, they
are easy to carry, store and use.In business activities, however, data security 
will be a serious concern because of the confidential
nature of the contents of data files. Since there is
always a risk that such important storage media might
be lost or stolen in transit, password protection
techniques are commonly used to protect information in
the media from unauthorized access and to ensure
reliable delivery. A password, or a uniquely defined
identifier, is previously written into the storage
media and a user attempting access to the contents will
be required to enter the correct password.This conventional password protection is simple
and easy to implement, but it should be noted that such
a password is also a potential subject of theft and
illegal use. Particularly in the case that data and a
program for its retrieval are packaged in the same
medium, the data will be exposed to more serious risk
and threats, since any terminal equipment can be used
for retrieving the data. Therefore, there has long
been a demand for more reliable security systems to
protect information in storage media from unauthorized
access and to ensure safe delivery.EP-A-0561685 discloses an electronic data
protection system for protecting data, such as software
used for a computer and data published electronically,
from being illegally copied by a third party. The
system includes: a storage medium for storing encrypted
data, a medium number and an encrypted permission 
information; a vendor computer having a personal key
operating unit for generating a medium key based on the
medium number, an

a portable storage medium (101) for storing
information, having a medium identifier (121) uniquely

assigned thereto; and
a computer unit (103), having a unit identifier
(104) for reading and writing the information in said

storage medium;
the security system further comprising:

first private key generating means (105) for
generating a private key based on the medium

identifier extracted from said storage medium and
the unit identifier, when said computer unit

attempts to write data into said storage medium,

data decryption key by decrypting the permission 

data extracted from said storage medium, with the
private key regenerated by said second private key

generating means, and
second decrypting means (112) for decrypting
the encrypted data extracted from said storage

medium with the data decryption key produced by
said first decrypting means.
