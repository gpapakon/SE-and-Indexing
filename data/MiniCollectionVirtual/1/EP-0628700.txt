<ABSTRACT>
The drilling tool is adapted for being releasably 
mounted to the lower end of a rod string (20) of a 

drilling rig (30) and comprises a container (2) 
having a cylindrical or truncated-cone shape fitted 

at its lower end with a plurality of cutting tools 
or cutters (10) for crushing rock. 
The drilling tool (1) further comprises: 

a plate (3) for releasably retaining a plurality 
of modular elements (14) forming a load (13); and 
curved blades (9), located proximate to the 
cutting tools (10), adapted for conveying rock 

spalls into the container (2) through suitable 
apertures (8) in the bottom of the container (2). 
 
The cutting tools (10) are mounted to a plurality of 

radial plates (7) securely fixed proximate to the 
bottom edge of the container (2). The curved blades 

are welded to the edges of the radial plates (7), 
the concavity of each blade (9) being arranged 

facing the direction of rotation of the drilling 
tool (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a rock drilling 
tool for use in constructing large diameter piles, 
ventilating shafts and other similar mining works. At present, in the field of large diameter 
piles drilling (i.e. piles having a diameter ranging 
within 600 and 2500 mm), some of the major 
difficulties are encountered in drilling operations 
where rocky soil or bedrock is found. The same 
difficulty arises also if only the base of the pile 
has to be fixed in the bedrock. In some cases, the 
above difficulty can seriously compromise the 
possibilities of constructing a pile workmanlike or 
in task time. Known large diameter pile drilling methods and 
relevant jigs and fixtures are currently used for 
drilling loose non-cohesive kinds of soil (sand and 
gravel) or cohesive soil (clay and silt). At most, 
these implements are used for drilling rather thin 
layers of rock characterized by having compressive 
strength not exceeding 200-300 kg/cm² (comparable to 
the compressive strength of concrete).  Large diameter piles drilling operations are 
usually carried out exploiting drilling rigs 
equipped with rotary tables and drilling tools 
consisting of buckets, or drills connected to 
rotaries through telescopic extractable rods. 
Buckets and drills are fitted with excavating teeth 
in the shape of blades, peaks or buttons. The thrust required for the teeth to penetrate 
the soil is provided by pull-down systems applied to 
the rotary. The telescopic elements forming the rod 
connecting buckets and drills to rotaries have been 
modified so as to increase penetration capacity of 
the teeth fitted to the tools and allow drilling of 
compact kinds of soil and brittle rock. Therefore, 
conventional thrust transmission friction systems 
employing strips welded to the rods have been 
replaced by mechanical locking systems for locking 
the rods together, whereby higher thrust values are 
transferable. Also, more powerful hydraulic pull-down 
systems have been recently used. Despite these important improvements, it is 
generally not possible to drill rocks having 
resistance values above 500 kg/cm². However, the 
advancing rate is not satisfactory from an  
 
industrial production point of view. At present, solutions adopted for drilling 
large diameter piles in rocks having resistance 
values exceeding 500 kg/cm² or in thick layers of 
rock, all generally involve core boring operations 
to weaken the section that has to be drilled. The 
above cited core boring operations are generally 
carried out by a series
