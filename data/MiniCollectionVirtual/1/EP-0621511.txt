<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
developing electrostatic latent images and a process
for producing the toner. More particularly, it relates
to a toner for developing electrostatic images which
comprises toner particle produced by polymerizing a
polymerizable monomer composition containing at least a
polymerizable monomer, and a process for producing the
toner comprising polymerizing a polymerizable monomer
composition containing at least a polymerizable
monomer, and obtaining the toner particle.There are many known techniques for
electrophotography, as described, for example, in the
specification of USP No. 2,297,691. In general, it is
a process in which an electric latent image is formed
on a photosensitive body utilizing a photoconductive
material by various means, the latent image is
developed by the use of a toner, and if necessary, the
toner image is transferred onto a recording material
such as paper, then it is fixed by heat, pressure or a
solvent vapor and the like, to produce a copy. Various 
methods have been proposed so far, for developing the
latent image by using the toner and for fixing the
toner image, and each image formation process employs
an appropriate method.Recently, the electrophotography has been required
to provide a copy of higher image quality at a high
speed.Generally, a process referred to as pulverization
process has been known for producing a toner, in which
a coloring material such as a dye and a pigment, and an
additive such as a charge controlling agent are added
to a thermoplastic resin, and melt-mixed to provide a
homogeneous dispersion, then it is pulverized and
classified using a pulverizer and a classifier to
produce a toner having a desired particle size. Accordingly, EP-A-0 533 172 discloses the preparation of toner
particles by polymerizing a polymerizable monomer composition
in an aqueous medium where the monomer composition contains
polymerizable monomer, polyester resin, wax and a charge
controlling agent. With the toner produced by the pulverization
process, there is a restriction in addition of a
releasing agent such as a wax. That means, in order to
assure the dispersibility of the releasing agent to be
a sufficient level, 1) a certain level of viscosity
should be maintained at the kneading temperature with
the resin, and 2) the content of the releasing material
should be less than about 5 parts by weight, and so on.
Due to these restrictions, the fixing capability of the
toner produced by the pulverization process is limited.On the contrary,
