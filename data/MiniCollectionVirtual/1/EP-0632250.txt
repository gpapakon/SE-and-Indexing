<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus responsive to rotation
of a shaft about an axis thereof for detecting displacement of
the shaft along the axis and angular misalignment of the axis
of the shaft with respect to a desired axis, comprising a
plurality of detectable elements disposed on a perimeter that
rotates with the shaft, at least one pair of the detectable
elements having respective extensions that converge with one
another so as to have an angular separation radially about the
shaft axis that decreases along the shaft axis, detecting
means mounted radially adjacent the perimeter to produce
respective output signals as the detectable elements move
therepast upon rotation of the shaft, and processing means
responsive to the mutual timing of the signals for producing
an output dependent on the axial displacement of the shaft.Such apparatus is known from EP-A-0443514. In this known
form of apparatus, the detectable elements take the form of a
pair of elongate ridges that extend, convergently, along a
perimeter of the shaft. The detecting means comprises a
distance sensor that produces a respective pulse as each ridge
moves past the sensor. Axial displacement of the shaft along
the shaft axis or angular misalignment of the shaft axis with
respect to the desired axis results in the pulses being
separated in time to a greater or lesser extent. However, it
is desirable to be able to provide improved discrimination 
between detection of displacement of the shaft along the shaft
axis and angular misalignment of the shaft axis with respect
to the desired axis.In accordance with the invention, therefore, the
apparatus as first set forth above is characterised in that
there are a plurality of the detecting means respectively
disposed at different angular positions around the perimeter,
each detecting means producing respective signals as the
detectable elements move therepast upon rotation of the shaft
whereby the signals produced by the respective detector means
have a timing relationship which is dependent on the
respective angular positions of the detector means and on the
axial displacement and axial alignment of the shaft.As is well known, in most rotatable equipment
applications in which there is a coupling between two
rotatable elements, axial alignment and displacement are
important factors that can affect the life of the equipment
and operating efficiency of the system. Ideally, of course,
coupled rotatable elements such as shafts, for example, are
aligned collinearly on a common axis of 
rotation to
