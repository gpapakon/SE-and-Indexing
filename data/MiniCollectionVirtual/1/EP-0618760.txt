<ABSTRACT>
A clip for attaching a print circuit board to a 
chassis and electrically connecting the earthing portion of 

the PCB to the chassis, comprising a board engagement 
portion to be inserted in and engage with a mounting hole in 

a PCB and a chassis engagement portion to be inserted in and 
engage with a mounting hole of the chassis and a transverse 

contact member engagement hole between the two engagement 
portions formed so that a conductive contact member inserted 

in said engagement holes contacts both the board engagement 
portion and the chassis engagement portion so that the two 

contact portions are connected electrically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clip for 
attaching a print circuit board (PCB) or the like to a 
support such as the chassis of a vehicle body or the like. An example of such a clip for attaching a PCB to 
the chassis of a vehicle body is described in Japanese U.M. 
Publication No. 51-39095. This clip has two engagement 
portions, i.e., a chassis engagement portion to engage with 
a vehicle body or chassis, and a print circuit board (PCB) 
engagement portion. The clip is attached to the chassis by 
insertion of chassis engagement portion in a mounting hole 
provided in the chassis and the PCB engagement portion of 
the clip thus attached to the chassis is pressed into a 
mounting hole of a print circuit board, thereby attaching 
the print circuit board via the clip to the chassis. 
This clip may be used to attach PCBs to the chassis at 
predetermined intervals and the attachment is simple. In general, an earthing portion of a print circuit 
board is connected to the chassis electrically. The same 
applies to mounting a PCB on a vehicle body. 
Conventionally, means for electric connection, in addition 
to the above-mentioned clip, is required to connect the 
earthing portion of the print circuit board to the chassis. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a clip for attaching a print circuit 
board or the like which is capable of attaching the earthing 
portion of the PCB to the chassis. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a clip for attaching a print circuit board or the 
like to a vehicle chassis or body or the like; characterised 
in that the PCB clip comprises an elongated member having 
one end formed with a board engagement portion adapted to 
engage the board when inserted into a mounting hole in the 
board and the other end formed with a chassis engagement 
portion adapted to engage the chassis when inserted into a  
 
mounting hole in the chassis, and a contact member 
engagement hole extending orthogonally to the longitudinal 
direction is formed in the clip between the two engagement 
portions, the engagement hole being adapted to receive a 
conductive contact member of which part extends to the board 
engagement portion and part extends to the chassis 
engagement portion when fitted in the engagement hole. 
Preferably an engagement portion in a mid portion of the 
contact member locks in the engagement hole, part of the 
contact member coming in contact with the board while part 
of the contact member comes in contact with the chassis so 
that

the board engagement portion and part extends to the chassis 

engagement portion when fitted in the engagement hole. 
A PCB clip according to Claim 1, having a 
conductive contact member inserted in said engagement hole 

wherein an engagement portion in a mid portion of the 
contact member locks in the engagement hole, one part of the 

contact member coming in contact with the board while 
another part of the contact member comes in contact with the 

chassis so that the two contact portions are connected 
electrically.
