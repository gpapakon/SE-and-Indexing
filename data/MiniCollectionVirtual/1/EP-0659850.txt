<ABSTRACT>
The expandable, flame-resistant (flame-retardant) coating compositions consist at least of     from 4 to 25 % by weight of a film-forming binder,   from 10 to 40 % by weight of ammonium polyphosphate, from 8 to 40 % by weight of at least one substance which is carbonised under the effect of heat,   from 6 to 25 % by weight of an expansion (blowing) agent,   from 0 to 5 % by weight of dispersants, and   from 0 to 25 % by weight of fillers.   In these coating compositions, ammonium salts of alkyl phosphates are present as substances which are carbonised under the effect of heat and/or as expansion agents, and as additional acid donors.

<CLAIMS>
An expandable, flame-retardant coating composition
comprising at least


from 4 to 25% by weight of a film-forming
binder,
from 10 to 40% by weight of a ammonium polyphosphate,
from 8 to 40% by weight of at least one
substance which is carbonized under the effect of

heat,
from 6 to 25% by weight of an expansion agent,
from 0 to 5% by weight of dispersants and
from 0 to 25% by weight of fillers,

wherein ammonium salts of alkyl phosphates are
present as substance which is carbonized under the

effect of heat or as expansion agent and as
additional acid donor.
A coating composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein

monoalkyl phosphates are present.
A coating composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein
dialkyl phosphates are present.
A coating composition as claimed in at least one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein the salts are hydroxyalkyl-substituted

ammonium salts.
A coating composition as claimed in claim 4, wherein
monoethanolamine is used as hydroxyalkyl-substituted

ammonium.
A coating composition as claimed in claim 4, wherein
diethanolamine is used as hydroxyalkyl-substituted 

ammonium.
A coating composition as claimed in claim 4, wherein
triethanolamine is used as hydroxyalkyl-substituted

ammonium.
A coating composition as claimed in at least one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein the salts are alkylsubstituted

ammonium salts.
A coating composition as claimed in claim 8, wherein
the alkyl radical has 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
A coating composition as claimed in at least one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein the salts are aryl-substituted

ammonium salts.
