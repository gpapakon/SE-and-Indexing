<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
producing a glass preform and more particularly, to an
apparatus for producing a glass preform by VAD (vapor phase
axial deposition).VAD is known as a method of producing a glass
preform. The glass preform is produced by VAD as follows.
While a starting rod or a core rod is being rotated by
fixing an upper portion of the starting rod or the core rod
to a shaft of a motor, soot comprising minute gas particles
obtained by causing reactions of gaseous raw materials in an
oxy-hydrogen burner is grown axially on the starting rod
or the core rod and thus, porous glass acting as a core and
a cladding is formed. The thus obtained porous glass is
heated by a ring heater formed of high-purity carbon such
that air bubbles contained between the glass particles are forced
out of the glass particles. As a result, a transparent
optical fiber preform is obtained.Such VAD includes a core forming step in which
porous glass acting as a core and a cladding is formed on a
starting rod while gripping an upper portion of the starting
rod and a jacketing step in which, while gripping an upper
portion of a core rod obtained by vitrifying the porous
glass, soot is formed on the core rod sequentially downwardly
so as to increase the diameter of the cladding. The jacketing
step is performed for the purpose of setting a ratio of 
diameter of the core to that of the cladding to a proper
value and is repeated a plurality of times in some cases.In both of the core forming step and the jacketing
step, since soot is formed by gripping only the upper
portion of the starting rod or the core rod, a lower portion
of the starting rod or the core rod is free and
thus, free vibrations of the starting rod or the core rod
are likely to take place. As a result, uniform adherence of
soot becomes difficult and thus, quality of the glass
preform deteriorates.As a countermeasure against vibrations of a rotor
in a rotational machine, it has been a common practice that
the number of rotations of the rotor and natural frequency
of the rotor are caused to deviate from each other. However,
in sooting by VAD, since natural frequency of soot
material obtained by depositing soot on the starting rod or
the core rod varies with deposition of soot, it is difficult
to adopt this known countermeasure.Therefore, in a sooting process of known VAD, no
special consideration is given to natural frequency of the
soot material. Thus, even if vibrations of the soot material
happen, the vibrations are allowed to continue
