<DESCRIPTION>
 Aqueous Coating CompositionThis invention relates to aqueous compositions useful as primers useful for enhancing the adhesion of coatings to polyolefin substrates.The application of paints and other coatings to substrates of polyolefin, such as polypropylene, thermoplastic olefin and polyethylene, is typically difficult because polyolefins are substantially chemically inert.This problem has previously been overcome by use of two different approaches which employ adhesion promoting compositions. One approach is to use an adhesion promoting composition as a separate primer coating between the polyolefin substrate and the paint. The primer coating adheres adequately to both the polyolefin and the paint and thereby creates a unitary three component structure with the paint as the outer portion of the structure. Another approach to coating polyolefins has been to use an adhestion promoting composition as an additive along with the paint. This technique is sometimes known in the art as use of a "stir in" adhesion promoter. Numerous polymeric materials have been investigated as possible components for such ashesion promoters. Chlorinated polyolefins have been found to be very satisfactory as the polymeric component for primer compositions due to their cost and performance. For example, U.S. 3,579,485, U.S. 4,070,421, U.S. 4,966,947, U.S. 4,962,149 and U.S. 4,954,573 disclose chlorinated polyolefins which are entirely satisfactory for the polymeric component of adhesion promoting compositions useful for coating polyolefin substrates. 

 Even though chlorinated polyolefins have been used to prepare adhesion promoting compositions which are entirely satisfactory, the chlorinated polyolefins had to be formulated with an organic solvent, such as xylene or toluene. Use of an organic solvent is undesirable because unless elaborate solvent recovery methods are employed application of the primer coating composition results in release of the organic solvent into the atmosphere which can result in both pollution problems and health problems for workers applying the primer coating composition.One approach to overcoming the problems associated with the use of organic solvents in primer coating compositions has been to replace the vast majority of the organic solvent. For example, a chlorinated polyolefin containing primer coating composition which is substantially free of organic solvents is disclosed in W090/12656. This composition is a five component composition containing a chlorinated polyolefin, a surfactant, an
