<ABSTRACT>
In an ink-jet recording method employing ink that 
includes an aliphatic or an alicyclic monohydric alcohol 

having a vapor pressure of 4 mmHg or less at 20 to 25°C, in 
which ink droplets are discharged by applying thermal energy 

onto the ink, and the amount of ink discharged, 
corresponding to one pulse of energy, is 5 to 20 pl/dot. A 

recording unit, and ink-jet recording apparatus employing 
the ink are also included.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to recording technology
using an ink jet recording method, a means for obtaining
photographs or graphics, or a color hard copy of computer
graphics, color CRT displays, and the like. The present
invention is also concerned with ink jet recording
technology capable of reproducing color images close to an
original image, clearly and at a high density.In ink jet recording methods, ink droplets are formed
by various ink discharge methods, and they are adhered to
recording members such as paper, converted paper, plastic
films, or cloth. This method is silent because the
recording head does not contact the member to be recorded,
and is advantageous, for example, because high-speed
printing is possible, and color images can be easily formed.Personal computers, from the desk-top type to the lap-top
and notebook type, have been increasingly developed to 
have color display devices. At the present time, when
application software utilizing the power of color
representation is available, it may be said that making
printers having color capability is the most promising
field.The following is required for color ink jet recording:
(1) It should be capable of reproducing a color image close
to the original image, clearly and at a high density in the
case of photographs, and color graphics, or a hard color
copy whose recording density of the recorded image is high,
such as computer graphics or color CRT displays, and the
like.(2) There should be no mixing of different colors
(bleeding) caused by non-fixing of the ink droplets when
different colors are brought close to each other.(3) The direction in which the ink droplets are discharged
for each pulse, and the discharge speed thereof should be
constant in order to achieve condition (1).(4) It is thought that a specific color is used in a very
small portion of a recording matter for color recording.
Therefore, no defective ink discharge should occur when
printing after a lapse of some time from when printing is
stopped (including speed variation in (3)) as compared to
the conventional monochrome ink.It has been disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 1-258979 that the discharge stability during
high-frequency driving is improved by having glycerol,
methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, or butanol in the ink.One way of increasing the recording density of a color
image is to decrease the amount of ink discharged in one
pulse. However, in an ink jet recording method, in
particular, in which ink is discharged by using
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet recording method in which ink is discharged by applying thermal
energy and the amount of ink discharged, corresponding to one pulse or

energy during a high-frequency driving at 6 kHz or more, is 5-20 pl/dot,
wherein for a stabilization of the ink discharge an ink is selected which

contains an alicyclic monohydric alcohol having 5-7 carbon atoms, said
alcohol having a vapor pressure of 533 Pa (4 mm Hg) or less at 20-25 °C

in said ink.
The method according to claim 1, wherein

the ink contains the alicyclic monohydric alcohol in an amount ranging from
0.1 to 15 wt.% with respect to the total weight of the ink.
The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein

the alicyclic monohydric alcohol is cyclohexanol.
The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein

the ink further contains alkali-soluble resin having molecular weight of
3,000 to 20,000.
The method according to claim 4, wherein

the alkali-soluble resin is contained in an amount ranging from 0.3 to
5 wt. % with respect to the total weight of the ink. 
A recording unit, comprising:

an ink housing section that holds an ink as selected for the method of any
one of the preceding method claims; and
a head section adapted for discharging said ink as ink droplets by applying
thermal energy, so as to discharge ink droplets under conditions as

specified in claim 1.
An ink jet recording apparatus, comprising:

an ink housing section as claimed in claim 6; and
a recording unit having a head section as claimed in claim 6.
An ink jet recording apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein

said head section forms a part of a recording head.
An ink jet recording apparatus according to claim 8, further comprising
an ink supply section for supplying the ink housed in said ink housing to

said recording head, said ink housing being in form of a cartridge.
