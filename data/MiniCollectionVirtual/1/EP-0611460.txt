<ABSTRACT>
Gas pressure control apparatus comprises a pressure body (10) having a lid (11) at the top, and divided into an inlet chamber (13) partially bounded by the lid and communicating through a port (21) with an outlet chamber (14). The inlet chamber (13) contains a valve stack (22) including a slam-shut valve (23) and a pair of pressure regulating valves (24, 25). The valve stack (22) is held together by bolts (40), and is mounted on the lid (11) by the bolts sliding through holes in a disc (46) forming part of the lid. Springs (47) urge the valve stack against the port (21) in an essentially planar manner to maintain a good seal between the valve stack (22) and the port (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control installations for gas transmission 
and distribution systems, and particularly to apparatus for reducing and controlling 
the pressure and/or flow of gas in a pipeline. In a gas transmission and distribution system, gas (i.e. fuel gas) is normally 
transmitted at high pressure, but has to be distributed to end users 
through local networks at a pressure which is relatively low and is also controlled 
fairly accurately. A pressure reducing station is therefore required for 
coupling the high-pressure transmission line to the local distribution network. Conventionally, a pressure reducing station comprises two streams in parallel, 
each stream containing an initial isolating valve, slam-shut valve, a 
suitable number of pressure regulating (reducing) valves depending on the amount 
of pressure reduction required, and a final isolating valve. A typical example 
of such a station is shown in our GB 2 217 877 A. Such a station is normally 
located above ground, and the fact that the various valves in each stream are 
arranged in a linear sequence means that it normally occupies a good deal of 
space. There has recently been increasing interest in the possibility of pressure 
reducing stations which are largely buried. A buried station has various 
advantages: it is relatively unobtrusive, the liability of accidental or deliberate 
damage to it is reduced, and the noise emission from it is reduced. A buried station naturally requires a hole or pit to be dug, and it is 
desirable to minimize the size of this pit. A somewhat different design has 
therefore been developed for buried pressure reducing stations. The basic 
feature of a buried pressure reducing station, in its current form, is a pair of 
pressure chambers, an inlet chamber and an outlet chamber. The inlet chamber 
usually includes a filter, and communicates with the outlet chamber through a 
valve stack (a valve assembly or cartridge) including a slam-shut valve and a 
suitable number of pressure regulating valves.  
 Various specific designs for such stations are known. The two chambers 
may be physically separate units located adjacent to each other, or they may be 
separate units but located in a common outer enclosure. More usually, however, 
they are separate regions of a single pressure body divided by internal walls. 
It is also common for such stations to be largely buried, as discussed above. The valve stack has controls which have to be accessible from outside the 
chamber. In addition, the valve
