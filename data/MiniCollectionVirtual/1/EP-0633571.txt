<ABSTRACT>
A controlled polarity recording channel capable of resolving a d + 1 
run-length, same-polarity data pattern. 

The system (25) includes a modulation 
encoder (202), a write equalizer (204), a signal 

channel (206), a read equalizer (208), a detector (210), 
and a modulation decoder (212). The read 

equalizer may optionally include a 
decision feedback equalization circuit (214) for 

restoring a d.c. component of an 
isolated pulse. The modulation encoder and decoder operate in a (d,k) run-length 

limited modulation code format. Also disclosed is a method for 
designing a read equalizer for resolving the d + 1 run-length, same-polarity 

data pattern upon readback in controlled polarity systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to controlled polarity recording and 
retrieval of data. More specifically, the present invention provides system, 
apparatus and method for controlled polarity digital magnetic recording. 
In particular, the present invention relates to a system for magnetic 
recording and retrieval of digital data having equalization of readback pulses 
of a controlled polarity, charge-constrained, run-length limited format. In digital data recorded in a non-return to zero inverted (NRZI) format, 
a "1" appears as a readback pulse with a single peak and a "0" as the 
absence of a pulse within a predetermined time interval ("bit cell" or 
"detection window"). In conventional peak detecting digital magnetic 
recording systems, in which a "1" is recorded as a transition in the 
magnetization state of a magnetic storage medium, written by switching the 
polarity of the electrical current energizing the write head, readback pulses 
alternate in polarity. In controlled polarity (CP) recording systems, 
successive readback pulses may have either the same or opposite polarity. 
The additional pulse polarity information is used to increase the information 
capacity of the recording channel. CP recording is typically used with (d,k) run-length limited (RLL) 
codes, where d is a minimum run-length (i.e., the minimum number of "0"s 
between successive "1"s) and k is the maximum run-length (i.e, the 
maximum number of "0"s between successive "1"s). In CP recording, for 
run-lengths of d + 1, d + 3, etc., successive "1"s pulses have same-polarity. 
Moreover, in CP recording, for run-lengths of d, d + 2, d + 4, etc., 
successive "1"s pulses have opposite-polarity. CP recording is described in: French, Catherine A., Wolf, Jack K. and 
Dixon, Glenn S. "Signalling With Special Run-Length Constraints for a 
Digital Recording Channel" IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, vol. 24, no. 3,
