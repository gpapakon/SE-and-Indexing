<ABSTRACT>
A method of storing and retrieving 
information with a consumable thermal transfer 

printer medium, wherein medium information to be 
associated with a thermal transfer printer medium is 

compressed and stored in physical association with 
the thermal transfer printer medium. The information 

compression may be by data compression means (which 
may or may not be adaptive), by error correction code 

means, or other suitable means; with or without an 
error correction code, and with or without 

encrypting. The information may be stored on the 
thermal transfer donor medium, on the thermal 

transfer receiver medium, on a label adhered to the 
medium, or on accompanying structure such as a spool 

or cassette.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal 
printing such as thermoplastic transfer printing or 
thermal dye transfer printing, and more particularly 
to such printing systems which use consumable media 
such as donor medium and/or receiver medium. Thermal printers selectively heat the 
elements of a print head to transfer dyes and inks 
from a donor medium to a receiver medium. 
Thermoplastic transfer printers have a donor medium 
that includes a meltable wax which is impregnated 
with colored pigments or inks. Portions of the wax 
layer are heated to a liquid state, and are 
transferred with the color pigments or inks to a 
receiver medium. Thermal dye transfer printers have 
a donor medium which carries a dye that is 
transferred to a receiver by a sublimation process. 
The amount of dye transferred is generally controlled 
by the amount of energy supplied to an individual 
element. A typical print head includes a plurality 
of selectively operable resistive heat elements. Receiver media are available in several 
types optimized for a variety of applications 
including reflection prints and transparencies. 
Similarly, donor media come in several types, such as 
monochrome or color. A typical thermal printer 
adjusts the energization of the print head based upon  
 
the type of donor and receiver media used to achieve 
an acceptable print quality. Thermal printers 
typically determine the type of media present in the 
printer by detecting information which may be marked 
directly on the media or on structures associated 
with the media such as a spool or cassette. Detection marks frequently convey 
information which identifies the media, provides 
positional information on the media, and also can 
provide additional helpful information. Examples of 
identification information include manufacturer, logo 
or trademark, media type or application, lot number, 
size of media, number of prints, number and/or 
sequence of colors, size of frame, and printing 
correction factors. Positional information may 
include side of media (front or back), beginning of 
media, beginning of frame, beginning of color patch, 
end of media, end of frame, initial print position, 
and direction (forward or reverse). Additional 
information may be included in detection marks, such 
as number of frames remaining, color of frame, 
quality of frame, printing sequence of frames, dye 
sensitivities, and change in dye sensitivities. 
Other kinds of information may also be included in 
the detection marks. One method a printer uses to
