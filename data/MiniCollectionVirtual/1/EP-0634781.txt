<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a rare gas discharge fluorescent 
lamp device which is long in life and high in brightness and 

efficiency. The lamp device comprises a rare gas discharge 
fluorescent lamp including a bulb (1') having rare gas such 

as xenon, argon or krypton gas enclosed therein, a fluorescent 
layer (2a) formed on an inner face of the bulb (1'), a 

reflecting film (2b), and a pair of electrodes (3a', 3b') 
located at the opposite ends of the bulb (1'). The lamp device 

further comprises a power source (8) for applying a voltage 
across the electrodes (3a', 3b'), and pulse voltage forming 

means (9, 10) connected between the electrodes (3a', 3b') and 
the power source (8) for forming a dc pulse voltage from a 

voltage supplied from the power source (8). The dc pulse 
voltage thus formed is applied across the electrodes (3a', 

3b') to cause the lamp to be lit. The pulse frequency of the 
pulse voltage and the enclosed gas pressure are determined 

depending upon the rare gas employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rare gas discharge
fluorescent lamp for use with an information device such
as a facsimile. a copying machine or an image reader
wherein fluorescent substance is excited to emit light
by ultraviolet rays generated by rare gas discharge.In recent years, the performances of information
terminal devices such as a facsimile, a copying machine
and an image reader have been improved together with
advancement of the information-oriented society. and the
market of such information devices is rapidly expanding.
In developing information devices of a higher
performance. a light source unit for use with such
information devices is required to have a higher
performance as a key device thereof. Conventionally.
halogen lamps and fluorescent lamps have been employed
frequently as lamps for use with such light source
units. However, since halogen lamps are comparatively
low in efficiency, fluorescent lamps which are higher in
efficiency are used principally in recent years.However, while a fluorescent lamp is high in 
efficiency, it has a problem that characteristics
thereof such as an optical output
characteristic vary in accordance with temperature
since discharge from vapor of mercury is utilized for
emission of light. Therefore. when a fluorescent
substance is used, either the temperature range in use
is limited. or a heater is provided on a wall of a tube
of the lamp in order to control the temperature of the
lamp. However. development of fluorescent lamps having
stabilized characteristics are demanded eagerly for
diversification of locations for use and for improvement
in performance of devices. From such background.
development of a rare gas discharge fluorescent lamp
which makes use of emission of light based on rare gas
discharge and is free from a change in temperature
characteristic is being proceeded as a light source for
an information device.FIGS. 7 and 8 show an exemplary one of
conventional rare gas discharge fluorescent lamp devices
which is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Publication No. 63-58752 (and DE-A-37 18 216), and wherein FIG. 7 is a
diagrammatic representation showing a longitudinal
section of a rare gas discharge fluorescent lamp and an
entire construction of the device, and FIG. 8 is a 
cross sectional view of the lamp. Referring to FIGS. 7
and 8, the rare gas discharge fluorescent lamp of the
device shown includes a bulb 1 in the form of an
elongated hollow rod or tube which may be made of quartz
or hard or soft glass. A fluorescent coating
