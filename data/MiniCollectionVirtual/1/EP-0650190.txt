<ABSTRACT>
A fabrication method whereby any commercial integrated circuit 
design can be made SEU hardened simply by the fabrication 

process. No circuit redesign is required nor is circuit 
performance degraded. The novel method employs fully depleted 

accumulated mode type transistors on a silicon-on-insulator 
substrate. Modified LDD fabrication techniques are employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to VLSI circuits and more particularly
to radiation hardening of VLSI circuits without redesign.Satellite-based integrated circuits are under constant
ombardment from the very high energy particles and photons
that are found in the outer atmosphere and in space. When
impacting an integrated circuit, these particles can generate
a local error, known as a single event upset (SEU).
Additionally, as VLSI circuits increase in complexity and
transistors sizes are reduced, even earth-bound integrated
circuits are susceptible to SEU from background sources.Typically, circuits are hardened against SEU by redesign
such that the transistor diffusion areas are much larger
thereby increasing the amount of capacitance that must be
discharged in order to cause an upset and/or adding resistors
to slow down any transient response. While effective in
increasing SEU resistance, redesigning of circuits has certain
drawbacks. These drawbacks include a loss in circuit speed,
particularly with resistors operating at low temperatures and
a loss of circuit density. Most importantly, the cost of
redesigning a commercial chip set can be very expensive. The manufacturing of semiconductor integrated circuits is an
expensive and very competitive business. This is particularly
true for the space product applications business, where
relatively low volumes prohibit economies of scale. As a
result,it is necessary to reduce costs without reducing
quality. A large portion of the cost of producing very large
scale integrated circuits (VLSI) is in the design of the
chips. Thus, whenever possible, it is desirable to use
existing design libraries. In general, this is the object of
designing radiation hardened chips, where non-hardened designs
are modified so as to meet the specifications required for a
particular application. Still, even in this example, modifying
the commercial design to comply with the SEU hardness expected
in space products adds a significant cost to the product. In
addition, circuit speed can be lost when resistors are added
or when the original circuit design rules must be relaxed.
Thus, a technology approach that eliminates the need for a
redesign would add significant cost and performance savings in
SEU hardened integrated circuits.The publication IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, volume 39,
