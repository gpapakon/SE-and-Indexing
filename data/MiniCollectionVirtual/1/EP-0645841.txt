<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a terminal block consisting of an insulating material housing (2) and of insulation-piercing terminal contact elements (7), which are arranged in said housing, for incoming and outgoing conductors. In order to simplify the connection of the conductors to the insulation-piercing terminal connecting elements (7) and to enable protection of the cables against overvoltages and overcurrents as well as making it possible to pick off voltages which pass via the terminal block, it is proposed according to the invention that the insulation-piercing terminal contact elements (7) be arranged separately from one another in the insulating material housing (2), and that each insulation-piercing terminal contact element (7) be connected to a centre tap (18) and that the centre taps (18) which are opposite one another spaced apart in the insulating material housing (2) be capable of being electrically connected to one another by means of different function connectors (31, 40, 50).

Terminal block comprising an insulating housing
(2) in which there are separately arranged insulation

piercing terminal contact elements (7) for incoming and
outgoing conductors, at least two pairs being arranged

next to one another in the insulating housing,
characterized in that the insulation piercing terminal

contact elements (7) are provided with contact taps
(21) and the insulation piercing terminal contact

elements (7) arranged next to one another can be
electrically connected on one side of the insulating

housing (2) by means of jumper plugs (38) which can be
inserted into the contact taps (21), and in that each

insulation piercing terminal contact element (7) is
connected via a base web (17) to a centre tap (18), and

the centre taps (18), situated opposite one another in
the insulating housing (2), can be electrically

connected to one another by means of function plugs
(31, 40, 50), the insulation piercing terminal contact

element (7) is arranged in the shape of a U at about
45° to the base web (17) and the centre tap (18) is

arranged in the shape of a U at about 90° to the base
web (17) and, moreover, the base web (17) has below the

insulation piercing terminal contact element (7) a
contact tongue (20) which extends parallel to the base

web (17) and at 45° to the insulation piercing terminal
contact element (7) and forms the contact tap (21)

together with the lower edge (48) of the base web (17). 
Terminal block according to Claim 1,
characterized in that ten pairs of insulation piercing

terminal contact elements (7) situated opposite one
another are arranged next to one another in the

insulating housing (2) .
Terminal block according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the insulating housing (2) is

formed from upper and lower parts (3, 4) which can be
latched to one another and which hold the insulation

piercing terminal contact elements (7).
Terminal block according to one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the centre tap (18) has an

insertion slot (32) for inserting contact tongues (33,
44, 53) of the function plugs (31, 40 50).
Terminal block according to Claim 4,
characterized in that a function plug is constructed as

a connecting plug (31) with a contact tongue (33) which
can be inserted into the insertion slots (32) of

opposite centre taps (18) and is held at a plastic body
(34) serving as a handle (49).
Terminal block according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the plastic body (34) of the link
connector (31) has at the opposite ends of the contact

tongue (33) latching lugs (35) which can latch in
latching grooves (36) arranged in the centre portion of

the insulating body (2).
Terminal block according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the latching lugs (35) are

constructed with a circular cross-section, and the
latching grooves (36) are constructed with a

semicircular cross-section.
Terminal block according to Claim 4,
characterized in that a function plug is constructed as

a fuse magazine (40) which comprises a plastic body
(41) with a holding chamber (42) for fuses (45) and a

connector guide (43) with two contact tongues (44)
which engage in the insertion slot (32) of two centre

taps (18) of a pair of insulation piercing terminal
contact elements (7). 
Terminal block according to Claim 4,
characterized in that a function plug is constructed as

a test plug (50) which comprises a plastic housing (51)
with two contact tongues (52), which are fitted on a

centre piece (52) and, with the test plug (50)
inserted, engage in the insertion slot (32) of the

centre taps (18) of two insulation piercing terminal
contact elements (7).
