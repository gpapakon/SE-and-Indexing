<ABSTRACT>
A staple cartridge (26) for a surgical stapler (20) 
includes a staple drive member (202) which is driven by 

longitudinal movement of a cam (78) through the surgical 
stapler for firing at least one surgical staple (66). The 

staple drive member (202) comprises a staple drive element (212) 
having a staple driving surface (64) in association with the 

surgical staple (66) for angular orientation of the surgical 
staple, when applied, with respect to the direction of 

movement of the cam. The staple drive member (202) further 
comprises a cam contact element (232) having a cam contact 

surface (216) for being engaged by the cam (78), and an 
arrangement (220,222) 

for pivotally connecting the staple drive element to the 
cam contact element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
staple cartridge for a surgical stapler of the type 
which includes a plurality of staple drive members in 
association with surgical staples which are designed to 
be driven by longitudinal movement of cam means for 
firing the surgical staples into body tissue. In 
particular, the present staple cartridge permits 
application of staples with a distally disposed staple 
arranged generally transversely of the remaining staples 
applied by the device. Surgical staplers have found wide-spread 
acceptance in surgical procedures since such devices 
drastically reduce the amount of time required by 
surgeons to suture body tissue. Typically, such surgical staplers have a pair 
of upper and lower jaw members to clamp body tissue 
therebetween. The lower jaw member carries a staple 
cartridge which contains a plurality of staple drive 
members having cam contact surfaces in association with 
one or more laterally spaced rows of surgical staples. 
The upper jaw member has an anvil portion to close the 
surgical staples which have passed through body tissue. 
The stapler is further provided with at least one pusher 
bar longitudinally moveable relative to the jaw members 
and having a cam surface for engaging the cam contact 
surfaces of the staple drive members, so that the 
longitudinal movement of the pusher bar sequentially 
drives the staple drive members, through a camming 
action, to fire surgical staples from the cartridge. When the surgical stapler of such typical 
construction is operated, the surgical staples are 
driven into the body tissues grasped between the upper  
 
and lower jaw members. Sometimes, a simultaneous 
longitudinal motion of a knife blade follows to cut the 
tissues along or between the one or more rows of closed 
surgical staples. As a typical result, at least one 
longitudinal row of surgical staples is placed on each 
of the opposite sides of the tissue cutting line to 
provide hemostasis along the cutting line. However, 
there remains the possibility of leakage between the 
tissues at a distal end of the cutting line and 
consequent bleeding therefrom since a suture is not 
placed transversely beyond the distal end of the cutting 
line to tightly hold the tissues. It is therefore desirable to provide a 
cartridge having at least one staple drive member 
capable of placing one or more surgical staples 
extending beyond the distal end of the tissue cutting 
line, with such staples arranged generally transversely 
of the rows of staples
