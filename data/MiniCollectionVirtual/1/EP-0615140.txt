<ABSTRACT>
An electric alternating current (5a) is impressed on the line in order to build up an electromagnetic field. A measuring head (7) having three coils (7x, 7y, 7z) aligned orthogonally relative to one another is guided along a scanning track which is situated transverse to the general course of the line. The axis of a first coil (7x) is orientated in a first direction (x) parallel to the scanning track, and that of a second coil (7z) is orientated in a direction (z) vertical thereto. The voltages induced in the three orthogonal coils are detected as a function of the scanning location and processed in separate processing passes. The position of the line is derived from the variations in the induced voltages.
