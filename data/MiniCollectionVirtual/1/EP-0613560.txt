<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of assaying for Alzheimer's disease in a human by determining the relative abundance of one or more forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or the enzyme responsible for said forms in circulatory fluid and to a method for treating the disease by modulating divalent cation, trivalent cation and/or heparin interaction with APP.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of treating Alzheimer's disease in a human by modulating divalent cation interaction with APP and a method for assessing neurological function using a formulation of zinc.Alzheimer's disease is a progressive dementia characterised by the deposition of amyloid in the intracellular and extracellular compartments of the cerebral cortex (Davies et al., 1988). The extracellular deposits consist of a protein or 4,000 relative molecular mass (Mr = 4K) referred to as βA4 (Kang et al., 1987). Molecular cloning and protein sequencing studies have shown that βA4 comprises part of the membrane spanning and extracellular domains of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which has features of an integral transmembrane cell surface receptor (King et al., 1987; Goldgaber et al., 1987).βA4 appears to result from abnormal cleavage of APP. Normal cleavage occurs at or near a lysine residue within the βA4 sequence (Esch et al., 1990; Sisodia et al., 1990; Palmert et al., 1989). Cleavage at this site would prevent formation of the amyloidogenic βA4 fragment. The enzyme which normally cleaves APP from the membrane surface is designated "APP secretase" although it has never been identified.At least one form of APP has been shown to have neutrophic activity, i.e. capable of promoting the survival or outgrowth of nerve processes. A disorder in APP processing may account for the loss of certain populations of neurons seen in Alzheimer's disease.There is now increasing evidence that APP is released from membranes, as part of its normal neurotrophic function, by cleavage at a site within the βA4 sequence (lysine 16) by APP secretase. As βA4 is produced in Alzheimer's disease, this indicates that a failure to cleave at this site might be the cause of Alzheimer's disease or at least contribute to the progression of the disease.There is a need for an assay which is of predictive and diagnostic value in monitoring Alzheimer's disease and for any therapeutic interventions therein. Preliminary studies have suggested that the levels of circulatory APP may be different in Alzheimar's disease patients compared to normals (Bush et al. 1991 WO-A-9116628) and that such changes may be a result of altered APP processing. In accordance with the present invention, it has now been discovered that processing of circulatory APP is altered in Alzheimer's disease thus providing a basis for an assay for the disease. Furthermore, from work leading up to the present assay, an improved means of treating Alzheimer's
