<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an air bag inflation gas generator 
to feed combustion gas for inflation of air bags such as air bags 

for absorbing collision shocks, life jackets, rafts, and escape 
chutes. When the generator is exposed to a high temperature 

environment such as fire and a temperature of a second end plate (39) 
rises, heat of the second end plate (39) is transmitted to an ignition 

agent (66) via a heat sensing means (91), the ignition agent (66) 
is ignited at 

a temperature thoroughly lower than the firing temperature of gas 
generating agents (57), and the gas generating agents (57) burn.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air bag inflation gas generator 
to feed combustion gas for inflation of air bags such as air bags 
for absorbing collision shocks, life jackets, rafts, and escape 
chutes. A prior shock absorber to protect a passenger car driver 
from shocks at collision accidents comprises an air bag and a gas 
generator to inflate the air bag with gas. At a collision 
accident of a passenger car, explosives or other gas generating 
agents having a similar composition thereto, which are charged 
in the gas generator, are ignited and burnt to produce gas. The 
air bag is instantaneously inflated by the resultant gas for 
protecting the driver against any collision shocks, thereby 
avoiding possible serious injury of the driver. Fig. 28 shows the air bag inflation gas generator filed by 
the applicant as Japanese Patent Application No. 299116/1991. 
This air bag inflation gas generator comprises a longitudinal 
outer cylindrical member 13 having a plurality of gas outlets 11 
formed in the outer periphery, an inner cylindrical member 17 
inserted in the outer cylindrical member 13 and having gas flow 
openings 15 formed in the outer periphery, a final filter 19 
disposed between the outer cylindrical member 13 and the inner 
cylindrical member 17, a plurality of gas generating agents 23 
with a through hole 21 formed at the center accommodated in the 
stacked state in the axial direction of the inner cylindrical 
member 17, and an igniter 25 and an ignition agent 27 disposed 
at one end of the inner cylindrical member 17, wherein the gas 
generating agents 23 and the ignition agent 27 are accommodated 
in a gas generating agent pack 29. With the above air bag inflation gas generator, volume of 
combustion gas from the gas generating agents 23 can be steeply  
 
increased and a large volume of combustion gas can be surely 
purified. But, in the above air bag inflation gas generator, when the 
generator is exposed to a high temperature atmosphere, for 
example, about 390 C°, the gas generating agents 23 in the 
generator reach a firing point and ignite themselves. At this 
time, a reaction velocity is very fast and the strength of a 
vessel accommodating the gas generating agents 23 is lowered at 
such a high temperature, so that there is a possibility that the 
vessel is exploded. And, since the above air bag inflation gas generator has the 
gas generating agent pack 29 merely accommodated within the inner 
cylindrical member 17, a space between the ignition agent 27 and 
the igniter 25 in
