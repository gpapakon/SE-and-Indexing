<ABSTRACT>
Described are fibres having a tenacity of more than 80 cN/tex and a filament linear density of more than 8 dtex which contain as the fibre-forming material an aromatic polyamide which is soluble in organic solvents and spinnable from isotropic spinning solutions. The fibres can be used for example as reinforcing materials, as heat-resistant insulator materials, for producing filter fabrics or as insulating materials.

the steps of:


a) preparing an isotropic spinning solution comprising
an organic solvent and at least one aromatic

polyamide which is soluble in organic solvents,
b) extruding the spinning solution through a
spinneret which contains orifices in a

predetermined number and shape so as to produce
a fiber of the desired filament linear density,
c) removing the organic solvent in a manner known
per se so as to produce solvent-reduced or -free

filaments of adequate mechanical stability and
non-tackiness for further processing, and
d) drawing the resulting filaments in a manner known
per se.

structure formed in step b) is introduced in step c)

processing.
