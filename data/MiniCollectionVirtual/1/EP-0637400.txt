<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultra-thin low 
moisture content or substantially dry polyester film. 
It also relates to the applications of such a film and a 
method of processing during which outgassing takes 
place, and notably a metallization process, and finally, 
it relates to metallized films and multi-layer 
capacitors obtained from such film. Polyester films, for example, in polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) such as Mylar® (DuPont), or in 
polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) such as those produced by 
Teijin, are known, along with their applications. Such 
applications include the use of these polyester films as 
dielectric material in multi-layer capicators where 
their use has increased considerably. In such 
capacitors, a film of metal deposited on the polyester 
acts as the foil of the capacitor. There are a very large number of manufacturing 
processes available. The common link between them is 
that they involve a step carried out under vacuum in 
which the virgin polyester film introduced in roll form 
is unwound, metallized and then wound again onto another 
core. In the majority of present-day processes, narrow 
strips are masked during this metallization step carried 
out under vacuum, in order to define non-conducting 
regions referred to as free margins. The roll of metallized film obtained can then, 
generally speaking, be treated in two different ways 
which, this time, are not done under vacuum. A first of 
such processes consists of unwinding the metallized  
 
film, slitting it in the middle of the free margins and 
then rewinding it in the form of flat rolls referred to 
as pancakes. Such pancakes are then, in their turn, 
unwound once again enabling either wound capacitors or 
what are commonly known as stack capacitors, to be 
obtained. A second process consists in unwinding the film 
which, in this case, is generally metallized on both 
sides, then covering it with an insulating varnish on 
one side and then rewinding it onto a drum. Stack 
capacitors can then be obtained by slitting or 
guillotining the stack at the middle of the free margins 
and in the perpendicular direction as well. The electrical capacity, expressed in Farads, of a 
multi-layer capacitor is, for a given volume, inversely 
proportional to the square of the polyester film 
thickness. This is the reason why there is a heavy 
demand for ultra-thin film which enable ever-increasing 
miniaturization to be achieved. There are currently 
available on the market films which can be as thin as 
0.6 microns, and

Polyester film having a thickness of less than 3 
µm and a weakly bound water content 

lower than 0.06 weight %, based on the weight of 
polyester, the weakly bound water considered being 

the water that is fully absorbed, uniformly, in the body 
of the polyester, and said water content being 

measured according to the following procedure: cutting a 
series of rectangular pieces of size 5,72 cm x 6,55 cm, 

stacking one on top of the other so as to constitute a 
sample weighing about 100 g, accurately weighing said 

sample 30 seconds after obtaining it, subjecting said 
sample to high vacuum for at least 90 hours, and weighing 

again immediately after such treatment under vacuum; and 
determining the relative weight difference.
