<ABSTRACT>
The lock comprises a locking pawl (1) articulated on a shaft (2) and, in the locking position, capable of retaining a bolt (4) cooperating with a keeper (9); the lock comprises means (E) for driving the pawl (1) which are capable of retracting it in order to release the bolt (4) and allow the door to be opened, the said lock comprising, furthermore, electrical control means (24) for ensuring extra security by rendering the drive means (E) ineffective on the pawl and by preventing the opening of the lock from inside the vehicle, particularly by action on a fascia pull or equivalent member. The means (E) for driving the pawl comprise an arm (10) pivoting about the shaft (2) of the pawl, with a possibility of translational movement between an active position, in which this arm can control the rotation of the pawl (1), and an inactive position, in which this arm (10) is ineffective on the pawl (1), the change of the arm (10) from the active position to the inactive position being ensured by the extra-security electrical control means (24).

Motor vehicle door lock including a locking pawl 
(1) articulated on a spindle (2) and capable, in the 

locked position, of retaining a latch (4) interacting 
with a striker (9), the lock including means (E) for 

driving the pawl (1) which are capable of moving it out 
of the way in order to release the latch (4) and allow 

the door to be opened, the said lock furthermore including 
control means (24) for providing deadlocking by 

making the driving means (E) have no effect on the pawl, 
the means (E) for driving the pawl comprising an arm (10) 

which can be moved between an active position in which 
this arm can rotate the pawl (1) and an inactive position 

in which this arm (10) has no effect on the pawl (1), the 
arm (10) being moved from the active position into the 

inactive position by the deadlock-control means (24), 
engagement/disengagement means being provided between the 

pawl (1) and the arm (10), these means being brought into 
action by the movement of the arm (10), and comprising, 

on the same side as one of the two elements which consist 
of the pawl (1) and the arm (10), a pin (17) and, on the 

same side as the other element, an aperture (14) which 
has two regions, namely an effective region (15) in which 

the aperture interacts with the said pin via a radial 
edge (15a) in such a way that a rotational movement is 

transmitted by the arm (10) to the pawl (1), and a 
neutral region (16) in which the pin (17) can move freely 

in the aperture (14) without interacting with one of its 
radial edges, in such a way that a rotational movement is 

not transmitted to the pawl by the arm (10), the lock  
 

being characterized in that the arm (10) is mounted so 
that it can pivot about the stationary spindle (2) of the 

pawl (1) with a possibility for translational movement, 
the arm (10) including an oblong opening (11) in which 

the pivot spindle (2) of the arm (10) and of the pawl (1) 
is engaged, the active position of the arm corresponding 

to the spindle (2) coming into abutment against one end 
of the oblong opening (11), and the inactive position 

corresponding to the spindle (2) coming into abutment 
against the other end of the said oblong opening (11) in 

such a way that when the pin (17) interacts with the 
effective region (15) a rotational movement in an appropriate 

direction of the arm (10) is transmitted to the 
pawl (1), whereas when the pin (17) is moving freely in 

the aperture (14) without interacting with one of its 
edges, a rotational movement of the arm (10) is not 

transmitted to the pawl. 
Lock according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the pin (17) is provided on the pawl (1) and that the 

aperture (14) is provided on the arm (10). 
Lock according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the arm (10) is made to rotate by a pin (12) coupled to 

a linkage (T) and moving in an elongate aperture (13), in 
the shape of an arc of a circle, provided in the arm (10) 

and situated on the opposite side to the aperture (14), 
relative to the opening (11). 
Lock according to either of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the aperture (14) has an effective 

region (15) which extends over a small angle, and a 
neutral region (16), closer to the pivot spindle (2) of 

the pawl, which extends over an angle greater than the 
possible angular excursion of the arm (10) in such a way 

that the pin (17) of the pawl cannot reach the ends of 
this neutral region (16) in the event of the arm (10) 

being actuated. 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the arm (10) is made to pass from the 

active position into the inactive position by a member 
(18) that can pivot about a spindle (19) parallel to the  

 
pivot spindle (2) of the pawl, this pivoting member (18) 

having two branches (20, 21), one of which includes an 
elongate aperture (22) in which a stub (23) borne by one 

end of the drive arm (10) at the opposite end to the 
aperture (14) is engaged. 
Lock according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
the aperture (22) of the pivoting member (18) extends 

over a large enough angle to allow an excursion of the 
arm (10) allowing the lock to be opened, by driving the 

pawl (1). 
Lock according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the pivoting member (18) is driven by a lever (34) 

which is itself driven by a rack (28, 29), the movements 
of which are controlled by a deadlock electric motor 

(24). 
Lock according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the pivoting member (18) is situated outside a leaktight 

housing in which there are placed the deadlock motor (24) 
and another lever (32) in engagement with the rack (28, 

29) and keyed, at its opposite end to the rack, onto a 
journal (33) passing in a leaktight manner through a wall 

bounding the leaktight region in which the deadlock motor 
is to be found, this journal (33), on the outside, 

bearing the lever (34) for driving the pivoting member 
(18). 
Lock according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the pivoting member (18) includes a lug (37) allowing 

a mechanical action using a key for unlocking the 
lock in the event of breakdown of the electric deadlock 

motor (24).
