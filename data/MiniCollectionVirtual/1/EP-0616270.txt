<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in output 
control of a charger (a transfer electrode and a separation 
electrode) in an electrophotographic copying apparatus, and in 
particular, to that in output control of a transfer electrode. Generally, in a copying machine of the type mentioned 
above, a document placed on a platen glass is illuminated by 
light of a luminous lamp of a reading section, then, reflected 
light from the document forms an electrostatic latent image on 
a photoreceptor (OPC (organic photoreceptor) or the like) drum 
or a belt charged electrically at high voltage, the 
electrostatic latent image is developed to be a visible toner 
image in a developing section, and the toner image is 
transferred onto a transfer sheet entering a 
transferring/separating section synchronously with the 
photoreceptor and the transfer sheet is separated from the 
photoreceptor to be conveyed to a fixing section where the  
 
toner image is fused and fixed through heat fusing on the 
transfer sheet which is finally collected. However, when the humidity is high in the place where a 
copying machine is installed, a resistance value of a transfer 
sheet is varied due to its moisture absorption. Therefore, 
even when a stationary electric current at high voltage is 
given to a transfer electrode, electric charges different in 
terms of polarity from that in toner which are generated by 
the high voltage current given do not remain on the transfer 
sheet but leak along it through grounding, resulting in a 
transfer failure wherein an image is not transferred normally 
thus the toner image on the photoreceptor is conveyed to a 
cleaning section where the toner image is erased fruitlessly. 
Or, when a high voltage current is intensified for the purpose 
of correcting the aforementioned failure, the percentage of 
moisture content of electric charges generated by the high 
voltage current emerged from the transfer electrode rises and 
the charges begin to float on the transfer sheet whose 
electric resistance has been lowered, resulting in blurred 
transfer wherein the toner image on the photoreceptor is 
blurred to be transferred onto the transfer sheet. As a technology for preventing or eliminating the 
phenomenon mentioned above, Japanese Patent Publication Open 
to Public Inspection No. 57042/1978 (hereinafter referred to 
as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication) discloses a technology 
wherein a humidity is measured in a copying machine and is fed  
 
back to a power supply for a transfer
