<ABSTRACT>
The radar system covers a road area from a raised location, the velocity (speed) and classification features of the vehicle being detected in various range zones with respect to the radar system. In this case, the velocity is detected in a range zone which is further away, and the vehicle outline is detected at least in one close range zone. Range selection is carried out by an additional modulation of the radar transmitter of the traffic radar system, and the silhouette of the vehicle is in this way measured for classification. In this case, a plurality of antenna beams can be provided both for the velocity measurement and for the classification. Mutually overlapping direction-finding beams can be used for the velocity measurement. In order to achieve improved contour sharpness, the radar signals which are measured for classification and have a signal profile in time which is calculated in advance are correlated using methods of 
>
 direction-finding sharpening, said signal profile being determined by radar parameters, the installation geometry and the previously measured velocity of the vehicle to be classified.
