<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic device (1) in which a 
photoconductor drum (3) is charged by a charging roller 

(5). Insulating liquid (19;30) is applied at their 
initial nip. The charging roller both charges and 

substantially squeegees dry the photoconductor member. 
The liquid (19) may be produced by incomplete cleaning 

by a cleaning blade (21). Excess liquid is collected at 
the sides. This results in reduction in foreign gases, 

and reduction in the operating potential between 
photoconductor drum and charging roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrophotographic imaging 
apparatus having contact charging of the photoconductor 
and development on the photoconductor by liquid toner. 
Contact charging minimizes adding foreign gases to the 
surrounding air, and liquid development permits 
development with fine particles employing a wide range 
of dyes and pigments. Both contact charging and liquid development are known 
technologies. U.S. Patent No. 5,017,965 to Hashimoto et 
al is illustrative of contact charging. U.S. Patent No. 
5,121,164 to Landa et al is illustrative of liquid 
development. According to the present invention there is provided an 
electrophotographic imaging apparatus comprising an 
endless photoconductor member for imaging, an endless 
contact charging member contacting the photoconductor 
member for charging said photoconductor member, said 
photoconductor member and said contact charging member 
rotating during imaging to form a nip as said members 
rotate in contact, a liquid development system to 
develop an electrostatic image on said photoconductive 
member by applying liquid toner, and means to apply an 
insulating liquid to said nip. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described 
by way of example and with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is an illustrative side view of an embodiment in 
which incomplete cleaning provides dielectric liquid to 
the pre-nip region;  
 Fig. 2 is a similar illustrative view of an embodiment 
in which a dedicated liquid source provides dielectric 
liquid to the pre-nip region; Fig. 3 is a front view illustrative of excess liquid 
collection; and Fig. 4 is a side view illustrative of excess liquid 
collection. Figures 1 and 2 indicate what may be an essentially 
conventional, electrostatic printer 1 (largely shown 
illustratively) having a rotating photoconductor roller 
3 and a charge roller 5 to charge the roller 3. Charge 
roller 5 is in contact with and moves in the same 
direction as photoconductor roller 3 to form a nip 7 
where said roller 5 and roller 3 come into contact. 
Charge roller 5 replaces the common corona charging. 
This embodiment employs an amount of insulative liquid 
occupying the nip 7 region. After charging by roller 5 and imaging from a light 
source 8, such as a laser beam, photoconductor roller 3 
rotates to a developer station 9, at which liquid toner 
is applied. The developed imaging is then transferred 
to paper 11 or other final substrate or, alternatively, 
to an intermediate medium (not shown

<CLAIMS>
An electrophotographic imaging apparatus comprising 
an endless photoconductor member (3) for imaging, an 

endless contact charging member (5) contacting the 
photoconductor member for charging said photoconductor 

member, said photoconductor member and said contact 
charging member rotating during imaging to form a nip 

(7) as said members rotate in contact, a liquid 

development system (9) to develop an electrostatic image 
on said photoconductive member by applying liquid toner 

(19), and means (21;32) to apply an insulating liquid 
(19;30) to said nip. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which said 
means to apply an insulating liquid (19) comprises a 

cleaning station (21) for said photoconductor member (3) 
which, in use, incompletely cleans said photoconductive member. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which said 
means to apply an insulating liquid (30) comprises an 

applicator (32) to apply liquid to said photoconductor 
member (3) after, in use, the latter is cleaned. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in 
which said charging member (5) is pressed against said 

photoconductor member (3) to squeegee said liquid (19; 
30) from said photoconductor member. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in 
which said charging member (5) is shorter than said 

photoconductor member (3), and wherein liquid collection means (21, 
48) are located at at least the region or regions of 

said photoconductor member where, because it is shorter, 
said charging member does not contact said 

photoconductor member.
