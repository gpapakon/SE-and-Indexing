<ABSTRACT>
An intraluminal stent (10) includes a continuous helix of 
zig-zag wire (11) and loops (12) which connect adjacent apices of the 

wire. The stent is compressible and self-expandable 
substantially to a pre-compressed configuration. A method of 

forming the stent includes bending a length of wire into a 
zig-zag configuration and a helix and connecting adjacent apices 

of the wire. A method implanting this stent includes compressing 
the stent radially, implanting it in a predetermined 

location of a body vessel, and allowing it to recoil to the 
configuration it had before compression.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a vascular prosthesis, 
and more particularly to an intraluminal stent which has a 
flexible and elastic tubular construction with sufficient hoop 
strength to prevent elastic recoil of balloon-resistant strictures 
or to produce delayed dilation of those strictures. WO 92/00043 describes a body implantable stent consisting of stent 
segments being of open weave construction, formed of multiple 
braided, helically wound strands of resilient material. The stent 
is elastically deformed to a reduced radius when deployed. When 
released after positioning, the stent self-expands radially. Due 
to the woven structure of the segments, the ability to be radially 
reduced and expanded depends on the movability of the strands 
within the woven structure.  
 Palmaz U.S. Patent No. 
4,733,665 discloses a balloon-expandable intraluminal graft, 
including an embodiment comprising a wire mesh tube. 
Intersecting wire members, secured to one another at their 
intersections by welding, soldering or gluing, form the wire 
mesh and define a diamond-like pattern. This structure provides 
a relatively high resistance to radial collapse; but it suffers 
a number of disadvantages. First it is a rigid structure which 
cannot easily assume the configuration of a curved vessel which 
receives it. Second one must use a balloon catheter to expand 
and implant it. This requirement limits the length of the  
 
graft, as does the rigidity. Other prior stents have more flexible constructions; 
but they suffer other disadvantages. Wiktor U.S. Patent No. 
4,886,062, for example, discloses a stent which has a relatively 
flexible construction. This construction includes a deformable 
wire bent into a zig-zag design and coiled in a spiral fashion. 
The resulting wire tube has an open configuration with a reduced 
hoop strength. Each hoop lies essentially isolated from the 
adjacent hoops and does not obtain substantial support from 
them. Moreover, the open configuration increases the risk that 
plaque elements may herniate through the coil. Finally, one 
must use a balloon catheter to expand and implant it. Thus, the 
length of the stent cannot exceed the balloon length of 
available balloon catheters. The intraluminal stent of the present invention avoids 
the disadvantages of the prior art stents and grafts. It has 
sufficient hoop strength to prevent elastic recoil of 
balloon-resistant strictures. The stent of the present 
invention has a flexible construction which allows it to follow 
the
