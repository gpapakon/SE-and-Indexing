<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display system
for displaying an image, and more particularly to a
display system for displaying a stereoscopic image for
industrial, medical, or domestic use.In a conventional stereoscopic display system, an
observer wears glasses for separating right and left
target images from each other whereby right and left
eyes of the observer can selectively see the right and
left target images, respectively, which are displayed
on an image screen in a time-division fashion. In
another conventional technique, a lenticular plate is
attached to an image screen so that the lenticular
plate can separate right and left images from each
other and thus right and left eyes of the observer can
selectively see the right and left target images,
respectively.Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the configuration
of the above-described conventional stereoscopic-image
display system, which includes glasses 60 capable of
separating right and left images from each other,
liquid crystal shutters 61a and 61b, a synchronous 
circuit 62, and color CRT 63 serving as an image
display device.The above first example of a stereoscopic-image
display system having such a configuration operates as
follows. The color CRT 63 displays target images
wherein images for right and left eyes are displayed
alternately in a time-division fashion. Under the
control of the synchronous circuit 62, the liquid
crystal shutter 61a of the glasses 60 is opened and
thus become transparent only when a target image for
the right eye is displayed, and the liquid crystal
shutter 61b is opened and become transparent only when
a target image for the left eye is displayed. As a
result, an observer wearing the glasses 60 can observe
a target image for the right eye with his or her right
eye, and a target image for the left eye with the left
eye. In this way, stereoscopic vision is provided.Fig. 2 illustrates the configuration of the second
example of a conventional stereoscopic-image display
system, which includes a lenticular plate 71 having a
large number of stripe-shaped cylindrical lenses and a
color CRT 72 serving as an image display device.This second example of stereoscopic-image display
system having such a configuration operates as follows.
The color CRT 72 displays simultaneously both target
images for right and left eyes such that images for 
right and left eyes are displayed alternately on each
half-width stripe of the lenticular plate 71. The right
eye of an observer sees only the target image for the
right eye displayed
