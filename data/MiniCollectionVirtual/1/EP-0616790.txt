<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an articulated connection (4) for a household appliance, such as especially a vacuum cleaner, a steam cleaning apparatus or the like, the articulated connection (4) being designed as a swivel joint and, if desired additionally as a tilting joint, between an appliance shaft (2), which is designed preferably in the manner of a tube for the passage of a fluid or suction or compressed air, and a working attachment (5). In order to further develop the known articulated connection, especially with regard to improving the manipulability, two swivel joints (10, 12) are provided, between the working attachment (5) and a connection piece (11) and also between the connection piece (11) and the appliance shaft (2).

<CLAIMS>
Joint connection for a domestic appliance (1) such as in
particular a vacuum cleaner, or a steam cleaning appliance, the joint

connection (4) being provided between a handle (2) of the article which
is preferably formed in the manner of a tube for a fluid or suction air

or pressurised air to be conducted therethrough and a work attachment
(5) formed as a swivel joint and optionally also as a tilting joint,

two swivel joints (10, 12) being provided, between the work attachment
(5) and a connection portion (11) and between the connection portion

(11) and the handle (2) of the appliance, characterised in that the
handle (2) of the appliance acts on a coupling portion (18) provided

inside the connection portion (11) by means of a resilient transfer
member (22).
Joint connection according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the transfer member (22) is formed as a spring winding (21), which is

pre-loaded against the coupling portion (18).
Joint connection according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the handle (2) of the appliance acts on

the one end or the other end (48, 49) of the spring winding (21)
according to the direction of rotation.
Joint connection according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the coupling portion (18) is formed as a

tubular conduit portion.
Joint connection according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the conduit portion is rotatably

connected with a conduit knee (39) located in the region of the bend
(29), the conduit knee extending right into the work attachment (5).
Joint connection according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the joint connection (4) is tiltably

mounted in the work attachment (5).
