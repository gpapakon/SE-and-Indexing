<ABSTRACT>
In known processes, in particular using hydrazine compounds, amino compounds are added in high concentration to the developer solution in order to increase the contrast; these amino compounds are volatile and cause an undesired or harmful odour and corrosion in the development equipment. If the development is carried out in the presence of onium compounds whose molecules contain both quaternary nitrogen functions and tertiary amino functions, odour-free developers can be used which do not liberate corrosive vapours. The invention can be used in reproduction technology of the print precursor.
