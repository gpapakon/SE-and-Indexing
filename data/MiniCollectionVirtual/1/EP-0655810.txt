<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims to prevent terminal metal 
fixtures in an L-shaped bulb socket from being exposed 

and to positively hold the fixtures. Each terminal metal 
fixture 1 is inserted into a fixture accommodating chamber 

15 in an axial direction of a connector inlet port 9 through 
a fixture insertion opening 17 formed in a rear wall of 

a housing 7 while a male terminal 5 of the fixture 1 is 
being fitted to a through-hole 14 formed in a fixture 

holding wall 13. Then, a lid member 19 is thrusted in the 
opening 17 in an axial direction of a bulb inlet port 8 on 

a thrust groove 21 formed in an end face of the bulb inlet 
port 8. Thus, the opening 17 is covered by the lid member 

19. A side plate 4 of clamp portions 2 of each terminal 
metal fixture 1 is clamped in a space between a stepped 

face 24 on the housing 7 and the lid member 19, thereby 
preventing the fixture 1 from moving vertically or 

horizontally. Also, the male terminal 5 is closely fitted 
in the through-hole 14, thereby preventing the fixture 1 

from moving.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an L-shaped bulb socket in
which a bulb inlet port is arranged to be perpendicular to
a connector inlet port.Heretofore, for example, a light device for an
automobile has utilized an L-shaped bulb socket, which has
a bulb inlet port and a connector inlet port arranged to
be perpendicular to the bulb inlet port and accommodates
terminal metal fixtures each of which has a pair of clamp
portions adapted to hold each terminal of a bulb and a male
terminal joined perpendicularly to the clamp portions.Such a conventional L-shaped bulb socket is generally
made by insert-molding the terminal metal fixtures.
However, a process of producing the socket requires much
labor. Thus, a method of assembling the socket has been
developed. An example thereof is disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. 62-137588 (1987).For convenience of explanation, a conventional
L-shaped bulb socket will be described below by referring
to FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4 is a longitudinal sectional view
of the conventional L-shaped bulb socket and Fig. 5 is
a front elevational view taken along lines V-V in FIG. 4.As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the L-shaped bulb
socket is provided in its housing a with L-shaped fixture
accommodating chambers d which include a bulb inlet port b
and a connector inlet port c arranged perpendicularly to the
bulb inlet port b. The housing a is provided in its front
portion with slots e which extend from the bulb inlet port b
to the connector inlet port c. Terminal metal fixtures f
are pushed into the fixture accommodating chambers d through
the slots e. When an elastic lock piece h projected from
a side face of clamp portions g of each terminal metal
fixture f engages with a recess i formed in a side wall of
each chamber d, the fixture f is secured in the chamber d. However, since the slots e are left open even after
the terminal metal fixtures f are inserted in the housings
a, any conductive elements can easily enter the slots e to
contact with the fixture f.Since the terminal metal fixture f is prevented
from coming out of the housing a only by engagement of the
elastic lock piece h and recess i, the fixture is readily
subject to vibration and consequent detachment from the
housing a.An object of the present invention is to provide
an L-shaped bulb socket which prevents a terminal metal
fixture from being exposed and can positively hold the
terminal metal fixture.In order to achieve the above object, an L-shaped
bulb socket comprises: a housing having a bulb inlet port,
a connector
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An L-shaped bulb socket comprising:

an L-shaped housing (7) having a bulb inlet port (8), a connector
inlet port (9), a pair of fixture accommodating chambers (15), and

a fixture insertion opening (17) formed in a wall opposite to
said connector inlet port, said bulb inlet port being

arranged to be perpendicular to said connector inlet port
in said housing;
a pair of L-shaped terminal metal fixtures (1) disposed in said
respective fixture accommodating chambers, each terminal

metal fixture having a pair of clamp portions (2) adapted to
hold each terminal of a bulb and a terminal portion adapted

to be connected to each terminal of a connector, said
terminal portion being joined perpendicular to said clamp

portions and passing through a hole (14) in a terminal holding
wall (13) in the housing; and
a lid member (19) mounted on said fixture insertion
opening slidably in a bulb inserting direction to cover

said opening.
An L-shaped bulb socket according to Claim 1, wherein
each said fixture accommodating chambers (15) is provided at its

bent portions with the terminal holding wall (13) which contacts
with the distal end of said clamp portion of said terminal

metal fixture, and wherein said holding wall is provided
with the hole (14) to which a male terminal portion of said

terminal metal fixture is closely fitted.
An L-shaped bulb socket according to Claim 1 or 2,
wherein said fixture insertion opening is formed in a side

wall of said housing, and wherein said lid member covers
said opening and a part of said side wall.
