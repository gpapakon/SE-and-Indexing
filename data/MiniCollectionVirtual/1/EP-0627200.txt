<ABSTRACT>
In a mixing capsule (10) for dental substances (28, 38) there is a mixing chamber (12) with a hollow piston (14). A plunger (16) is guided so as to be displaceable in the hollow piston (14). The hollow piston (14) is provided with a locking member (18) which engages through a recess in the mixing chamber (12) into the piston (14) and causes locking there.

A mixing capsule for dental compounds, having a
mixing chamber in which a piston (14) is guided in sliding

movement, a ram (16) being arranged for sliding movement in
the piston (14), and the mixing chamber (12) has an

applicator opening (22) through which the dental compound
can be applied, wherein when pressure acts on the ram (16) a

sliding movement takes place between the piston (14) and the
ram (16), on the one hand, and the mixing chamber (12) and

the piston (14), on the other hand, for the application of
the dental compound, wherein the piston (14) has at least

one recess (40) in which a locking member (18) engages which
can be removed manually for the application of the dental

compound (28,38), characterised in that the locking member
(18) is substantially U-shaped and the central arm of the

locking member (18) is extended to form a grip handle (60),
and in that a circumferential annular groove (52) is formed

on the mixing chamber (12), in which the locking member (18)
can be accommodated with two lateral arms (54).
A mixing capsule according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the recess (40) is in the form of an

annular groove and the locking member (18) is in the form of
a disposable part.
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the locking member

(18) is a part which can be fitted into the recess (40) and,
in particular, engaged in the annular groove, which part is

separate from the mixing capsule (12) and also from an
applicator device.
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the recess (40) has 

externally on the piston (14) a step (41) with a downwardly
facing shoulder, i.e. facing towards the applicator opening

(22).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the recess (40) has

externally on the piston (14) a step (43) with an upwardly
facing shoulder, i.e. towards the end of the ram (16).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the locking member

(18) supports the piston (14) on one step (41;43) on two
opposite sides.
A mixing capsule according to any one of Claims 1
to 6, characterised in that the locking member (18) supports

the piston (14) at two locations offset with respect to one
another.
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the mixing chamber

(12) has a lateral passage opening (54) which can be
penetrated by the locking member (18).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the mixing chamber

(12) has an upwardly facing support surface (51), on which
the locking member (18) can be supported.
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the annular groove

(52) on the mixing chamber (12) is formed by two projecting
annular beads (48,50), between which the locking member (18)

is retained, wherein at preferably two opposite locations
the locking member (18) extends through the bottom of the

annular groove (52) and thus the wall of the mixing chamber
(12).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the locking member 

(18) has a resiliently inwardly acting lateral arm (54)
which can be engaged in an annular groove (40) of the

piston (14).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the piston (14) is

bell-shaped, the upperlying base of the piston (14) guiding
a ram rod (44) of the ram (16).
A mixing capsule according to Claim 12,
characterised in that the ram (16) can be fully retracted in

the bell-shaped piston (14) and the length of the ram (16)
including the ram rod (44) corresponds to the length of the

piston (14).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the length of the

mixing chamber (12) considerably exceeds the length of the
piston (14) and the piston (14) can be entirely accommodated

in the mixing chamber (12).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the dimensions and

materials of the ram (16) and the piston (14), on the one
hand, and of the piston (14) and the mixing chamber (12),

on the other hand, are chosen so that the friction of the
piston (14) with respect to the mixing chamber (12) is

lower than the friction of the ram (16) with respect to the
piston (14).
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the ram rod (44) of

the ram (14), which in particular is kept in a signal
colour, is formed so as to be externally smooth and thin and

free of any grip handle so that it cannot be withdrawn from
the piston (14) without an implement.
A mixing capsule according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the applicator 

opening of the mixing chamber (12) is sealed airtight with a
sealing bar (20) and the friction of the ram (16) in the

piston (14) is greater than the force arising from the
compression of the air remaining close to the dental

compounds (28;38), when the ram (16) is fully inserted into
the piston (14).
