<ABSTRACT>
In a matrix video display system for displaying moving images, e.g. 
TV pictures, and using a time-persistent type of display panel (10), such 

as an active matrix LC display panel, having a row and column array of 
picture elements (12) which is driven (15) by addressing the rows in 

sequence repetitively in successive fields according to an applied video 
signal, the amount of
 blur perceived by a viewer when viewing moving 
images is reduced by processing the video signal to enhance moving 

components in the display image in accordance with their speed. A 
speed-dependent high spatial frequency enhancement filter circuit (40) 

operates on the video signal to provide an enhanced signal which is 
supplied to the panel (10). The enhancement is such as to compensate 

for the speed dependent low passing of the eye of a viewer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to matrix display systems, particularly video
display systems, for example, for displaying TV pictures, of the kind
comprising a display panel, for example a liquid crystal display panel, for
displaying moving images and having a row and column array of picture
elements which are periodically addressed to produce display outputs
and a drive circuit for driving the picture elements according to an
applied video signal, the picture elements being driven by addressing
the rows in sequence repetitively in successive field periods and holding
their display outputs for at least a substantial part of the interval
between successive addressing. The invention relates also to methods
of operating such display systems.Video display systems comprising display panels having an array of
picture elements, such as liquid crystal elements, for displaying TV
pictures, computer graphics, and the like are well known. Larger area
display panels commonly include an active switching device, for
example a TFT or thin film diode, associated with each picture element
to improve display quality. In operation, the display panel is illuminated
by a light source and the picture elements serve to modulate the light
according to the video information of an applied video signal to produce
a display output. The picture elements are connected to row and
column address conductors and the rows of picture elements are driven
in sequence by scanning the row conductors with selection signals so
as to transfer to the respective picture elements video information, data,
signals on the column conductors, which are derived by sampling the
input video signal. After all rows have been addressed in one field 
period, this operation is repeated for successive field periods. The
scanning, and hence field, frequency is determined by timing signals of
the input video signal, and the field rate of the display panel
corresponds to that of the supplied video signal. For a PAL TV display,
for example, each row of picture element is addressed in a line period
of 64 microseconds, or in the interval between successive line periods,
which occurs once every 20 milliseconds, corresponding to the field
period. In the case particularly of active matrix display panels, then for
the interval between successive addressing (corresponding to a field
period) the picture elements are effectively isolated so that charge is
stored on the picture element, and hence the display effect produced by
the picture element substantially maintained, until the
