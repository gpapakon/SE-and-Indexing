<ABSTRACT>
A pin seam for use in woven papermaking fabrics, wherein more than 50 % of the warp strands from each of the fabric ends are used to form the pintle retaining loops. The loops formed at one of the opposing fabric ends have an "S" orientation, while the loops formed at the second opposing end have a "Z" orientation, thereby allowing the two sets of pintle retaining loops to interdigitate easily. The resulting seam is strong, easily installed on the papermaking machine and has a reduced propensity to mark the paper web. The invention is particularly applicable to fabrics woven using 3-shed weave patterns or integral multiples thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved, high 
strength, high loop density, woven back pin seam for use in 
joining the ends of papermakers' and like fabrics. Woven fabrics, intended for use in either the 
forming, pressing or drying sections of paper making 
machines, are usually rendered endless by one of three 
methods: 
1) endless weaving, such as is described in US-A-2,903,021; 2) joining the opposing ends of a flat woven fabric with 
a permanent seam, such as is described in US-A-3,366,355; 
US-A-3,596,858 or US-A-3,700,194; or 3) joining the opposing ends of a flat woven fabric by 
forming small loops in the opposing fabric ends and 
then interdigitating these loop ends during 
installation of the fabric on the papermaking machine 
to form a passageway through which a pintle is inserted 
to form a hinge-type joint. Such seams are described, 
for example, in US-A-4,182,381, US-A-4,469,142 and US-A-5,092,373. The present invention is concerned with the last 
of these methods. Although several types of these seams are 
presently in use on papermaking fabrics, the most desirable 
type of seam, which produces the least mark in the paper web 
in contact with it, is a woven back pin seam, wherein the 
warps of the fabric are used to form the loops which receive 
the joining pintle. The loops are formed by weaving back 
the ends of some of the warps into a nearby warp path in the 
fabric, in registration with the fabric weave. Such seams 
are well known in the prior art, and are referred to in the 
trade, and henceforth in this disclosure, as pin seams.  
 Because of their length, dryer fabrics are almost 
always joined on the paper machine with an on-machine seam, 
and therefore this invention applies particularly to dryer 
fabrics. However, press fabrics are also often joined by 
pin seams, as are some coarse forming fabrics, and the 
invention applies equally well to these types of fabrics. It is well known that most prior art pin seams are 
formed in fabrics woven in 4-shed or 8-shed weave patterns. 
Such designs are particularly well suited to pin seaming due 
to their even number of sheds. The pin seam is typically 
made by removing a predetermined number of weft strands from 
each end of the fabric and then reweaving the crimped warp 
strands, which now project from both fabric ends, through a 
plurality of added weft, in a manner that is well known. 
The weft strands are generally chosen from a group 
consisting of thermoplastic polymer monofilaments, spun 
yarns, multifilament yarns, plied

<CLAIMS>
A woven dryer fabric, for use in the dryer section of a 
paper making machine, said fabric having a first and 

second end (A, B) which are joined by a pin seam 
including a pintle (P) and pintle retaining loops (1,2; 

2,3), wherein in the fabric: 

a) the warp yarns (1,2,3) are polymeric monofilaments 
woven at a warp fill of from about 80% to about 

120%, wherein the term warp fill denotes the 
amount of warp in a given space as a percentage, 

relative to the total space considered; and 
b) the warp yarns from which the pintle retaining 
loops are formed at said first and second fabric 

ends are rewoven into the fabric so that their 
preset crimp is maintained in registration with 

that of the fabric weave pattern; 
 
and further wherein in the pin seam: 


i) the pintle retaining loops have a loop fill 
greater than 50 %, wherein the term loop fill 

denotes the percentage of the total available 
number of warp yarns at each end of the fabric 

which are used to form the pintle retaining loops; 
ii) the pintle retaining loops are each formed from a 
length of warp yarn which is no greater than two  

 
and one-half repeats of the fabric weave; 
iii) the pintle retaining loops on said first fabric 
end have an "S" orientation; and 
iv) the pintle retaining loops on said second fabric 
end have a "Z" orientation. 
A dryer fabric according to claim 1, wherein the fabric 
is a 3-shed weave, and the loop fill is 66 2/3%. 
A fabric according to claim 2, wherein the weave design 
is an integral multiple of 3-sheds, and the loop fill is 

66 2/3%. 
A fabric according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the pintle loops comprise monofilaments 

(1,2;2,3) having a rectangular cross-section whose long 
axis extends substantially parallel to the axis of the 

pintle (P). 
A fabric according to claim 4, wherein in at least some 
of the pintle retaining loops the warp yarns have a 180Â° 

twist. 
A fabric according to any one of the preceding claims 
including a plurality of weft layers.
