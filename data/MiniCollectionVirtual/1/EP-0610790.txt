<ABSTRACT>
A recording sheet finishing apparatus (400) connected with an image 
forming apparatus, in which recording sheets delivered from 

the image forming apparatus are stapled and the stapled sheets 
are ejected. The apparatus includes a plurality of stackers (426,436) 

each having at least one stapler (ST1,ST2). The apparatus further 
includes a control means (G1,G2) in which the recording sheets 

delivered from the image forming apparatus are stapled 
alternately by the staplers (ST1,ST2) for each set of recording sheets 

and after that, each of the stapled set of recording sheets 
are delivered from the stapler to a delivery sheet tray (T1,T2) so 

that the stapled recording sheets are pushed back toward the 
delivery tray (T1,T2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording sheet 
finishing apparatus for automatically conducting the stapling 
operation by a stapler on recording sheets, on which images 
are recorded by an image forming apparatus, and after 
stapling, the recording sheets are delivered from the 
finishing apparatus. Specifically, the present invention 
relates to a recording sheet finishing apparatus appropriate 
for the image forming apparatus in which high speed processing 
can be conducted. A recording sheet finishing apparatus, which is called a 
finisher, is used for an apparatus by which a plurality of 
recording sheets, on which images have been recorded and whict 
are delivered from the image forming apparatus, are collated 
and stapled for each copying volume. This finisher is connected with the image forming 
apparatus main body in terms of function, and is driven in  
 
correspondence with sequential operations of the copying 
processes. Accordingly, with respect to the image forming apparatus 
which can conduct the copying processes at high speed, the 
finisher, which can perform its function at the 
correspondingly high speed of the image forming apparatus, is 
necessary. Concerning the finisher which can carry out the copying 
processes at a high speed, various proposals have been made in 
the following publications: Japanese Patent Publication Open 
to Public Inspection No. 142359/1985, No. 158463/1985, No. 
239169/1987, No. 290653/1987, No. 310459/1988; and Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 41991/1993. In these proposals, since 
only one stapler is provided or only one delivery tray is 
provided in the finisher, the processing speed can not be 
greatly increased. Specifically, in the first two 
publications, since the function is necessary, in which a 
bundle of recording sheets stacked on two intermediate trays 
being collated, are conveyed to one stapler placed at another 
position, the structure becomes complicated, and additional 
operations are required, which are disadvantageous.  
 Further GB-A-2 248 608 discloses a recording sheet finishing 
apparatus connected with an image forming apparatus as in the preamble of claim 1. The 
recording sheets are stapled at desired positions by a single 
stapler which is moved from one of the desired positions to 
another by control means. The known apparatus comprises a 
rotatable discharge belt for receiving and conveying the stapled 
recording sheets, an exist tray, and a detector for detecting a 
position of a protrusion on the belt. The object of the

<CLAIMS>
A recording sheet finishing apparatus for an 
image forming apparatus, which finishing apparatus staples recording sheets 

discharged from said image forming apparatus and ejects the 
stapled recording sheets, said recording sheet finishing 

apparatus (400) comprising: 

(a) a rotatable belt (425,435) for receiving and conveying 
stapled recording sheets (P), said belt having a 

protrusion (427,437) thereon, 
(b) a discharge tray (T1,T2) for receiving the recording 
sheets (P) conveyed by said belt (425,435), and 
(c) a detector (S24,S25) for detecting a position of said 
protrusion (427,437) provided on said belt (425,435) 

after said belt has conveyed the stapled recording 
sheets (P), whereby an initial position of said belt 

at which a stapling operation is conducted can be set, 
 
characterized by 


(d) control means (CPU) for sequentially switching over 
conveyance speed of said belt (425,435) to a first 

speed (V1) when said belt receives the recording 
sheets (P) which have been stapled, and to a second 

speed (V2) when a predetermined period of time has 
passed and before the recording sheets have been 

separated from said belt, wherein said first speed 
(V1) is lower than said second speed (V2). 
The recording sheet finishing apparatus of claim 1, further 
comprising: 


(e) a plurality of stackers (426,436) for stacking 
recording sheets (P) discharged from said image 

forming apparatus (120), 
(f) a plurality of staplers (ST1,ST2), each stapler 
provided on each of said plurality of stackers 

(426,436), respectively, for stapling the stacked  
 

recording sheets (P), and 
(g) at least one further discharge tray (T1,T2), wherein each of the plural discharge trays is 
arranged in correspondence with each of said plurality of 

stackers (426,436) for stacking the stapled recording 
sheets, 
 
wherein said control means (CPU) further controls said 

plurality of staplers (ST1,ST2) to alternately staple 
each set of recording sheets (P) stacked in said 

plurality of stackers (426,436), and to eject said 
each set of stapled recording sheets so as to be 

pushed to the correspondingly arranged discharge tray (T1,T2) in a direction 
away from each of said plurality of staplers.
