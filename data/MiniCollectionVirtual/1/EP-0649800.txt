<DESCRIPTION>
In many places in Holland and abroad, domestic
rubbish is still placed in plastic rubbish bags onto the
street at set times so that the rubbish collectors can
deposit these into a rubbish truck by hand. This method
of rubbish collection makes difficult the separation into
fractions thereof and yields an undesirable street
appearance. The more so when not everybody puts their
plastic rubbish bags onto the street at the same time.
Due to the heavy loads involved in their work, very few
rubbish collectors achieve their pension. A driver fore-in
and a man collecting rubbish at the rear of the
rubbish truck are needed.In certain areas in Holland, wheeled
containers, often of synthetic material, are provided for
residents, wherein the domestic rubbish can be collected.
These containers are then wheeled to the street at set
times, so that they can be emptied by means of a robot
arm on the rubbish truck.In order to separate the domestic rubbish into
fractions, different containers are put at the disposal
of the users. In addition this method is not practicable
in heavily populated city areas wherein, in one building,
a number of households live on differing floors.At the moment in a number of heavily populated
city areas, it is being considered to place containers on
the street, these being preferably provided with
different compartments for collecting different sorts of
rubbish, for instance vegetables, fruit and garden
rubbish, glass, paper etc. so that these can be emptied
at set times by means of a rubbish truck with a robot arm
whilst the residents can continuously deposit their 
rubbish in the correct compartments of the container and
so that dirtying of the street is obviated.A combined trash receptacle and advertising
carrier is known from the document US-A-1,424,519
(Richardson) dated from 1922.This receptacle was designed for the disposal
of small amounts of trash randomly disposed therein and
was irregularly emptied by hand, when full.The present invention has for its object to
further improve the known container and provides a
container for collecting rubbish comprising:
a number of posts and there between securably
mounted sidewalls which make up part of a frame;a lower wall mounted at the bottom of the
frame;an upper wall at the top of the frame, said
upper wall being hingeably secured to the frame at its
rear side and provided with one or more disposal openings
for the disposal of rubbish; andengaging means for allowing engaging of a
robot arm, characterized in that said engaging means
comprise a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Rubbish collecting container (1) for
collecting different types of rubbish from a number of

households, whereby the containers are emptied at
determined rubbish collection times, comprising:


a number of posts (2-4) and there between
securably mounted sidewalls (8, 9) which make up part of

a frame;
a lower wall mounted at the bottom of the
frame;
an upper wall (13) at the top of the frame,
said upper wall (13) being hingeably secured to the frame

at its rear side and provided with one or more disposal
openings (18, 19) for the disposal of rubbish; and
engaging means for allowing engaging of a
robot arm, characterized in that said engaging means

comprise a plate part (10) secured to the frame opposite
the rear end of the upper wall (13), in that said

sidewalls (8, 9) are made of galvanized steel and in that
one or more ancillary panels (20-23) are mounted on the

container (1) in front of the galvanized steel walls,
whereby each ancillary panel (20-23) is individually

replaceable by a replacement ancillary panel.
Container according to claim 1 wherein the
lower wall and the sidewalls are mounted onto the posts in

such a way that it is held at a distance from the ground.
Container according to claims 1 or 2, wherein
the ancillary panels on the lower side are provided with

grooves (25) for the placing thereof onto pins (24) on the underside
of the frame.
Container according to claims 1, 2 or 3,
wherein the container is provided with locking means (40)

which lock the upper wall on placing of the container onto
the ground.
Container according to claim 4, wherein the
locking means (40) comprise a locking hook (41) which is joined with a

joist (45) which projects through a post and which in the locked
position makes contact with the ground.
