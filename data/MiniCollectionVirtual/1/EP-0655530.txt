<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a groundcovering element, 
consisting of a plurality of components (1) with links 

(2,3) in between, a method for the manufacture thereof and 
a method for the manufacture of a mould (24, 25, 26, 27, 

29, 30). According to the invention it is provided that the 
links between the components are deformable and possibly 

flexible, resulting in a groundcovering element that is 
easy to lay, offers better possibilities of adjustment to 

various desired surfaces to be covered and is considerably 
more suitable for a more or less undulating terrain. In the 

method of manufacture, one steel mould part (34) cooperates 
with many rubber ones (31), so that with little investment 

a high production rate is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the
manufacture of a mould for the application of the
aforementioned method, which is constituted in that an
elastic mould is made of a plurality of model elements in
the desired mutual arrangement, that of same mould a cast
is made of a curable material, that said cast is finished
at the base until a desired bottom surface of the cast has
been obtained, and that of same finished cast a final mould
is made, in which, if need be, in the desired places slits
are made in the walls of the final mould, which are
suitable to accommodate deformable links. In applying said
method, it is possible to form a plurality of final moulds
of the finished cast, which naturally fall under the
present invention as well.The invention also comprises the use of the mould for producing
ground covering elements.Such a groundcovering element is known from the European
patent specification EP-B-0 004 364. This known element
consists of components, with rigid linking elements in
between, as well as a mesh of thin threads accommodated in
the bottom of the components and connecting them.The rigid linking elements ensure a sufficient bond between
the components, so that larger elements comprising a
plurality of components can be laid, which preferably
happens mechanically. The link between the components can
subsequently be broken by vibration, the mesh situated with
said linking elements being cut as well.Also WO 93/07339, EP-A-0.004.364 and GB-A-2 212 195 show
such groundcovering elements consisting of components, all
of which have an inflexible link between the components
and/or components touching each other. This leads to rigid
links.Said known groundcovering elements, however, have for many
applications a number of disadvantages. The first is that
handling such an in principle inflexible element without
the appropriate machines, such as is often the case for
example when laying out gardens or parks, is difficult,
especially because the various components are to rest
evenly on the ground. A further disadvantage is that the
elements are relatively difficult to adjust to certain
designs of the desired groundcover, the more so because the
links are not easily broken by hand. When, for example, it
is desired to lay half a circle in front of a tree and, in
case of a thicker tree, an inner row of elements can be 
omitted, it is hard work to break off and disengage such
components one by one. It may also happen that in covering
a surface it is desired that various elements interlock by
alternately

<CLAIMS>
Method for the manufacture of an elastic mould (22) that
is destined for the forming of ground covering elements

(1), 
characterized in that
 it comprises at least the
following steps:


selection of one or more different elements (17) of
natural stone,
the manufacture of elastic moulds (18) of the elements
(17) of natural stone,
using the elastic moulds (18) of the elements (17) of
natural stone to make a plurality of model elements

(19),
placing the model elements (19,20) in a predetermined
arrangement in a flat mould,
pouring a curable material over the arranged model
elements (19,20), the curable material resulting in a

final mould (22) of elastic material.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
method also comprise the step of


making slits (23) in the elastic material between
adjacent cavities in the final mould (22), which slits

(23) are to receive links (2,3) that connect the
individual elements (1).
Method according to claim 1-2, 
characterized in that
 the
different model elements (19) are provided with a socket

(20), as a result of which the model elements (19) have
about the same height.
Use of a mould (22) made by the method according claims
1-3 to make a ground covering element (1).
