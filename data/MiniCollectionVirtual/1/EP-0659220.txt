<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for producing a web with a carder (3) and a folder (2). Between the carder (3) and the folder (2) there is a pile store (5) with a variable storage volume. The pile store (5) is controlled by the cuttler belts (8, 9) of the folder (2). The rotation speed VB of the cuttler belts (8, 9) is variable and fluctuates in the intake region (10) at the rate of the absolute travelling speed VL of the cuttler carriage (7). The pile store (5) is emptied and filled with the pile (4) at the same rate owing to the control coupling.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for producing a nonwoven (31) made of fibre 
material having a web-producing means (3) and a web-laying means 

(2) which includes an upper carriage (6) and a laying carriage 
(7), characterised in that a web storage means (5) with a 

variable storage capacity is arranged between the web-producing 
means (3) and the web-laying means (2), the web storage means (5) 

storing variable web quantities and feeding, intermittently, more 
or less web (4) in a controlled manner to the web-laying means 

(2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
web storage means (5) is movable and has a variable storage size. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the web storage means (5) is controlled by the rotational speed 

VB of the laying bands (8, 9) of the web-laying means (2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the rotational speed VB of the laying bands (8, 9) is 

variable and fluctuates in the inlet region (10) at the rhythm 
of the absolute travelling speed VL of the laying carriage (7). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the subsequent 
claims, characterised in that the storage capacity can be reduced 

and increased at the rhythm of the travelling movements of the 
laying carriage (7). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the subsequent 
claims, characterised in that the web storage means (5) has a 

driven rotating storage band (18) which takes up the web (4) and 
forms a band loop (22) of variable size. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised in that a 
tensioning device is arranged in the band loop (22).  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
tensioning device has a storage carriage (23) with a supporting 

band (25) which rotates via rollers (26). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised in that 
outside the band loop (22) the tensioning device has a tensioning 

carriage (24) which is movable in the opposite direction to the 
storage carriage (32) [sic]
. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 8 or 9, characterised in 
that the storage carriage (23) and/or the supporting band (25) 

and/or the tensioning carriage (24) have a controlled drive. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6 or one of the subsequent 
claims, characterised in that the storage band (18) has a drive 

(21) which imparts to it, in the feed region (19) before the band 
loop (22), a speed VZ substantially equal to the exit speed of 

the web (4) at the web-producing means (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6 or one of the subsequent 
claims, characterised in that the storage band (18) has a further 

drive (29) which imparts to it, in the discharge region (27) 
after the band loop (22), a speed VA substantially equal to the 

laying-band speed VB in the inlet (10) of the web-laying means 
(2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 12, characterised in that the 
discharge roller (28) of the storage band (18) is coupled to the 

inlet roller (11) of the web-laying means (2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or one of the subsequent 
claims, characterised in that the laying-band drive (13) for the 

laying band (8), leading to the inlet (10), of the web-laying 
means (2) is arranged on a band deflection means (12) fixed to 

the frame.
