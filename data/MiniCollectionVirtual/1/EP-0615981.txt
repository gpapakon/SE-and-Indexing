<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a catalyst system supported on a support (carrier). The catalyst system is built up from at least one catalyst and at least one cocatalyst. The catalyst and the cocatalyst supported on a support material are brought into contact in a suspension solution. The catalyst is fixed to the support under the action of microwaves.
