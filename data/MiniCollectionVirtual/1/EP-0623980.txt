<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser (21) has, on the surface of a layer (25) adjacent to the active layer 
(24), a grating (29) with such a period as to reflect light in a direction transverse to the active layer 

(24); in this way light is emitted from a face parallel to the layer. The laser can be coupled to an 
optical waveguide (11) realized in a substrate (12) on which the laser (21) can be fixed and which 

is provided with a grating (13) capable of rotating the radiation emitted by the laser (21) by the 
angle necessary for transferring the radiation into the waveguide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to components for optical communication systems, and more 
particularly it concerns a semiconductor laser with emission in a direction transverse to the active 
region plane, and its coupling to an optical waveguide. Optical communication systems often need insertion of a laser into a optical interconnection 
circuit, by coupling it to an optical waveguide. One of the main problems arising when realizing this coupling, in the case of conventional 
lasers with longitudinal emission, is the criticity of the geometrical tolerances necessary to correctly 
position the laser emission region with respect to the waveguide input, due to the very small 
dimensions of the involved areas. For this reason, an indirect coupling is in general adopted, 
through fiber tails respectively fixed to the laser and to the waveguide and possibly connected 
through a suitable connector. This operation is long, difficult and therefore expensive; furthermore 
it can be performed only by skilled workers. A simpler and more rapid technique is already used for detectors: according to this technique 
the optical waveguide is associated to a minor-like element reflecting the radiation towards the 
sensitive region of the detector, which is fixed above the waveguide. In the case of the detector the 
positioning problem is actually less critical as the sensitive region of a detector is quite large. The application of this technique to the case of lasers requires the use of lasers emitting in 
vertical direction (perpendicular to the active region plane). Lasers with vertical emission are well  
 
known in the art and an example is described in US-A-463 3476: that laser is provided, in 
correspondence of the active layer, with reflecting grooves having walls inclined by such an angle 
that light is emitted in a vertical direction. In this kind of structure, the emission region has very 
small dimensions and therefore, should the structure be coupled to the waveguide through a mirror, 
the problem would arise of correctly positioning the laser emission region with respect to the mirror 
which transfers the light emitted by the laser to the waveguide. It is an object of the present invention to provide a laser of this type, having a large emission 
region, allowing a easy coupling to an optical waveguide, in a cheap manner and by employing 
non-skilled workers. The laser according to the invention comprises a grating, on the surface of a layer adjacent to 
the active layer, with such a period as to reflect
