<ABSTRACT>
Method for early detection, detection of the severity for a treatment-accompanying assessment of the course of a sepsis, as well as means for carrying out said method. Disclosed is a method for early detection, detection of the severity as well as for a treatment-accompanying assessment of the course of a sepsis as well as means for carrying out said method. According to the invention, the content of the peptide procalcitonin and/or of a partial peptide formed therefrom which is not the mature calcitonin is determined in a sample of a biological liquid of a patient. From the determined presence and amount of the certain peptide, a conclusion is made about the presence of a sepsis, its severity and/or the success of a therapeutic treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for sepsis diagnosis, in
particular to early detection and detection of the severity
of a sepsis as well as for a treatment-accompanying survey
of the therapeutical success of a sepsis treatment which is
based on the new knowledge that a certain peptide known per
se and possibly certain of its fragments represent reliable
biological markers for diseases of this kind appearing in
high concentrations and which may be determined relatively
simple according to classical detection measures.According to a more modern understanding of this disease,
the term "sepsis" as used in the present application
summarizes clinical pictures, for which, as a rule, fever,
leucocytosis, consciousness changes, a hyperdynamic
circulation ("warm shock"), and a hyper-metabolic status,
mainly as a consequence of the invasion of the normally
sterile tissue by microorganisms, are observed, whereas the
positive detection of germs in the blood, which was
previously understood to be a characteristic for a sepsis,
has become less important for the diagnosis "sepsis". For in
clinical studies it could be shown that the prognosis of
patients with sepsis is not dependent on the severity of an
infection, in particular a bacterial infection, but on the
severity of the septic reaction of the organism (see G.
Pilz, S. Fateh-Moghadam and K. Werdan in : Krankenpflege-Journal
29 (1991), pp. 483-492 and publications cited
therein). Accordingly, in addition to the positive blood
culture or instead of it, for a sepsis assessment at present
various laboratory parameters and hemodynamic parameters are
determined and taken into account for making a diagnosis and
assess the course of the disease, if necessary, using
computer-aided so-called Score systems, such as the APACHE 
(Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II Score
described in the above-indicated publication. However, so
far no individual parameter suitable as a reliable
biological marker is known, the determination of which is
highly expressive for a sepsis diagnosis. All parameters
used up to now have either an insufficient specificity or do
not allow a reliable assessment of the severity of a sepsis
and no therapy survey and, in addition to this, the
determination of substances, such as the tumor necrosis
factor (TNF), or interleukines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6),
is much too complicated, expensive and/or time-consuming
for a bedside determination.Therefore, there is still an urgent need of a reliable
biological marker which can be determined

<CLAIMS>
Method for early detection, detection of the severity
as well as for a treatment-accompanying assessment of

the course of a sepsis characterized in that in a
sample of a biological liquid of a patient the content

of the peptide procalcitonin and/or of a partial
peptide formed therefrom which is not the mature

calcitonin is determined, the determined presence and
amount of the certain peptide being indicative of the

presence of a sepsis, its severity and/or the success
of a therapeutic treatment.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that
procalcitonin and/or N-procalcitonin(1-57)-peptide and

/or C-procalcitonin-(60-116)-peptides are determined.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the corresponding peptide or peptides are determined in

an immunodiagnostic method by use of a monoclonal
antibody or a combination of a first monoclonal or

polyclonal antibody with a second monoclonal antibody,
which as such or combined with each other have a

specificity for procalcitonin or peptides formed
therefrom, and which allow to differentiate between

them and mature calcitonin and the CGRP peptide.
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that
procalcitonin is determined by means of an immunometric

assay wherein for binding the procalcitonin from the
sample a first monoclonal antibody is used binding the

procalcitonin in another region as the second
monoclonal antibody used for marking, so that a

differentiation between procalcitonin and its proteolyic
degradation products including calcitonin is

possible. 
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that,
apart from the first monoclonal antibody, for binding

procalcitonin at least one further monoclonal antibody
is used which binds the procalcitonin molecule in

another, further region.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 5, characterized
in that procalcitonin is determined by means of

an immunometric assay which selectively detects the
complete procalcitonin and/or C-procalcitonin(60-116)-peptide.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that procalcitonin is determined by

means of an immunometric assay which selectively
detects the complete procalcitonin and/or

N-procalcitonin-(1-57)-peptide.
Method according to claim 7, characterized in that
procalcitonin contents of more than 1 ng/ml sample are

indicative of the possible presence of a sepsis and
that procalcitonin contents in the range of 10 ng/ml to

500 ng/ml and higher correlate with an increasing
severity of the sepsis and a worsened prognosis.
Method according to claim 8, characterized in that
simultaneously in a parallel determination the

calcitonin level is determined and that the absence of
evidence for elevated calcitonin levels allows the

sepsis diagnosis to be made.
Method according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that
procalcitonin levels in the range of approximately up

to 20 ng/ml allow the sepsis diagnosis to be made, if
the presence of a serious virus disease as a reason for

the elevated procalcitonin level can be excluded. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that a serum or plasma sample is used

as the sample of a biological liquid.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that the monoclonal antibody is the

monoclonal antibody KC01 (DSM ACC2124) or the antibody
CT21 (DSM ACC2125).
Use of one or a plurality of immobilized first
monoclonal or polyclonal antibody(ies) on a carrier for

binding procalcitonin from a sample and a further
monoclonal antibody carrying a marker and binding

procalcitonin in a region which differs from the binding
region of the first antibody(ies) for determining

procalcitonin in amounts of 0.1 to 500 ng/ml serum or
plasma sample for the detection of sepsis according to

the method of any one of claims 1 to 12.
The use according to claim 13, in which the first or the
further monoclonal antibody is the antibody KC01 (DSM

ACC2124) or the antibody CT21 (DSM ACC2125),
respectively.
