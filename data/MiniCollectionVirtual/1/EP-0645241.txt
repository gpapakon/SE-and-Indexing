<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of paper faced foam which 
comprises (a) applying a foam-forming mixture to at least 

one advancing cellulosic sheet or composite thereof with an 
air- and/or moisture-impermeable material, the cellulosic 

sheet (i) being impregnated with cured polyisocyanate, (ii) 
being sufficiently flexible for unwinding from a roll for 

conveyance along a production line and (iii) having a 
moisture content which does not exceed about 10 percent and 

is evenly distributed throughout the cellulosic sheet, and 
(b) foaming and curing the faced foam-forming mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for continuously 
producing a rigid plastic foam insulation board having on 
at least one major surface thereof a cellulosic facing 
member which has been impregnated with polyisocyanate. The usefulness of foamed plastics is well known. The 
rigid types, because of their especially good thermal 
insulation properties, find extensive application in the 
manufacture of laminated articles for the building 
industry. These laminated articles can be made continuously or 
discontinuously, for example, batchwise in a mold. In 
either case, the process usually involves deposition of a 
foam-forming mixture onto a facing sheet and bringing a 
second such sheet into contact with the mixture before 
formation of the finished article. Particularly suitable facing sheets for such laminates 
from the standpoint of their inexpensiveness and ease of 
handling are cellulosic materials. The production of 
paper-faced rigid foams is described in many patents, e.g., 
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,686,047, 3,903,346, 3,940,517, 4,121,958, 
4,292,363, 4,366,204, and 4,764,420. Recent U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,008,359 and 5,140,086 describe 
the production of polyisocyanate-impregnated cellulosic 
materials, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,176 discloses the use of 
such materials to form relatively rigid and strong 
hydrophobic sheets as siding layers for structural siding 
products. The sheets are said to provide weather 
protection, impact resistance and wind penetration 
resistance to a structure, and to contribute to its racking 
strength. Structural siding products made with the sheets 
can substitute for the conventional let-in braces, plywood 
or oriented strandboard corner sheeting used to furnish 
racking strength in building structures, thus saving time, 
labor and expense in construction. It would be a considerable advance in the art to 
provide a method for the continuous production of a rigid 
foam insulation board which is faced with cellulosic  
 
material having a full range of facer properties desired in 
the art, including strength akin to that of U.S. Pat. No. 
5,204,176's siding layers but without their rigidity. The present invention relates to an improved method 
for the continuous production of a rigid foam plastic faced 
with at least one polyisocyanate-impregnated cellulosic 
material in a simple and economical manner. The present invention also is directed to the 
production of a rigid foam laminate having a polyisocyanate-impregnated 
cellulosic facing sheet which 
provides improved racking

<CLAIMS>
A method for continuously producing an insulation 
board comprising a rigid plastic foam core having two major 

surfaces and a facing material on at least one of the major 
surfaces, the method characterized by comprising: 


(a) conveying a facing material along a production 
line for attachment to one major surface of the core, 
(b) applying a foam-forming mixture to the facing 
material, 
(c) optionally conveying a second facing material 
along the line for attachment to the other major surface of 

the core, at least one facing material comprising a 
cellulosic sheet or a composite of a cellulosic sheet with 

an air- and/or moisture-impermeable material, the air-and/or 
moisture-impermeable material being interposed 

between the cellulosic sheet and the foam-forming mixture 
or being positioned on the outside surface of the 

cellulosic sheet, wherein the cellulosic sheet has been 
impregnated with about 5 to 20% by weight of polyisocyanate, 

and the polyisocyanate has been cured, and the 
cellulosic sheet (i) is sufficiently flexible so that it 

can be supplied from a roll for conveyance along the 
production line, and (ii) has a moisture content not 

exceeding about 10 percent, the moisture being 
substantially evenly distributed throughout the cellulosic 

sheet, and 
(d) foaming and curing the faced foam-forming 
mixture. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the 
air- and/or moisture-impermeable material is positioned on 

the outside surface of the cellulosic sheet and is a 
polymer or a metallic foil sheet, the sheet preferably 

being aluminum foil.
