<ABSTRACT>
A hologram structure (10) including a plurality of holograms 
having substantially identical reconstruction characteristics 

disposed on a substrate (11) for rotation about a rotation axis 
(A) and containing segments of a composite image. The holograms 

are angularly offset relative to each other about a rotation 
axis (A) such that the composite image is visible over at least 

one narrow solid angular region pursuant to rotation of the 
holograms about the rotation axis (A) and illumination of the 

holograms with a reconstruction beam (RB).

<DESCRIPTION>
The disclosed invention is directed to a hologram structure
comprising a plurality of holograms having substantially
identical reconstruction characteristics disposed on a substrate
for rotation about a rotation axis, each hologram being angularly
offset relative to each other such that an image is visible
in at least one narrow solid angular region pursuant to rotation
of the holograms about the rotation axis and illumination of
the holograms with a reconstruction beam.Such a hologram structure is known from US-A-4 878 719.Rotatable holographic structures are useful in displaying
logos, trademarks, and the like on products that rotate as well
as on advertising displays that include rotating elements. For
example, rotatable holographic structures can be utilized on
digital compact discs, phonograph records, automobile wheels
and hubcaps, and other devices having visible rotating elements.The rotatable holographic structure mentioned at the outset
includes a plurality of identical holograms that are rotationally
offset relative to each other, such that a stationary image
is formed when the hologram structure is rotated at an
appropriate rotational speed. A consideration with such
holographic structure, however, is that the holographic image
is also viewable when the holographic structure is stationary,
which reduces the impact of seeing the holographic image when
the holographic structure is rotating. It would therefore be an advantage to provide a
rotatable holographic structure that produces a viewable
complete composite image only when it is rotating at an
appropriate rate.The foregoing and other advantages are provided by the
invention in a holographic structure that includes a
plurality of holograms having substantially identical
reconstruction characteristics disposed on a substrate for
rotation about a rotation axis, each hologram containing
segments of a composite image and being rotationally offset
relative to each other such that the composite image is
visible pursuant to rotation of the holograms about the
rotation axis and illumination of the holograms with a
reconstruction beam wherein the composite image is comprised
of a superposition of the image segments.The advantages and features of the disclosed invention
will readily be appreciated by persons skilled in the art
from the following detailed description when read in
conjunction with the drawing wherein:FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional view illustrating an
illustrative example of a rotatable holographic structure
in accordance with the
