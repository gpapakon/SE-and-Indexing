<ABSTRACT>
A method for co-registering a semiconductor wafer 
(14)
 undergoing work in one 
or more blind process modules 
(10)
, 
(12)
 requires a means 
(16)
, 
(18)
 for consistently and 
repeatably registering the semiconductor wafer 
(14)
 to each process module 
(10)
, 
(12)
. 
Given this consistent and repeatable singular wafer registration means 
(16)
, 
(18)
, the 
location of the coordinate axes of each process module 
(10)
, 
(12)
 is determined with 
respect to the position of the semiconductor wafer 
(14)
 that is registered therein. The 
present invention method provides three approaches for determining the location of these 

axes: (1) an absolute location of the axes, (2) a relative location of the axes using one 
blind process module 
(10)
 to measure the position of a pattern etched into the 
semiconductor wafer 
(14)
 with another blind process module 
(12)
, and (3) a relative 
location of the axes using one blind process module 
(10)
 to measure surface or layer 
thickness characteristics in the semiconductor wafer 
(14)
 as modified by wafer processing. 
Regardless of which approach is followed, the determination of the location of the 

coordinate axes in each process module 
(10)
, 
(12)
 is an effective co-registration of the 
semiconductor wafer 
(14)
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the registration of semiconductor wafers 
undergoing work in process modules and, in particular, relates to a method for co-registering 
semiconductor wafers undergoing work in one or more blind process modules. A process for measuring the thickness of an outer material layer of a 
semiconductor wafer is known as a wafer metrology process. During such a wafer 
metrology process, a semiconductor wafer is mechanically registered to a stage in a wafer 
metrology instrument. The wafer metrology instrument generates a map that indicates the 
thickness of an outer material layer of the semiconductor wafer over an entire surface of 
the wafer. This outer material layer thickness map is used by another instrument that 
thins, or etches, the outer material layer to a desired thickness. The outer layer thinning, 
or etching, instrument includes some type of tool that is directed onto the surface of the 
wafer. This tool must be properly positioned along the surface of the wafer to ensure that 
the thinning, or etching, process is performed at the correct location on the wafer surface. 
To ensure that the wafer is properly processed, an accurate correlation between the outer 
material layer thickness map and the position of the wafer with respect to the thinning, or 
etching, tool is required. This correlation between the outer material layer thickness map 
and the position of the wafer with respect to the thinning, or etching tool is accomplished 
by registering, or co-registering, the wafer to both the wafer metrology instrument and 
the thinning, or etching instrument in a consistent and repeatable manner. The current approach for consistently co-registering a semiconductor wafer to both 
metrology and thinning, or etching instruments begins by marking, or scribing, the wafer 
with a set of alignment fiducials during the metrology process. The wafer is then placed 
in the etching instrument on a larger diameter wafer which serves as a surround. The 
surround is made of the same material as the wafer undergoing work to maintain a 
consistent reaction in the thinning, or etching, process along the edge of the wafer. The  
 
flat of the fiducialized wafer is then abutted to a flat of a registration surface, also made 
of the same material as the wafer for the same reason as the surround, that is taped to the 
surface of the surround, thereby registering the wafer in one direction. The wafer 
metrology fiducials are then visually aligned with a corresponding set of scribe
