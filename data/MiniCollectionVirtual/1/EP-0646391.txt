<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a defibrillator with a pulse-generating
device with at least three outputs to which
electrodes are connectable for delivering defibrillation
pulses and having the features of the preamble of claim 1.A defibrillator of this kind is previously known from DE,
A1, 41 10 402. In this device, electrical impulses are
simultaneously emitted across all electrodes, and pulse
voltages can be set so there is a favorable distribution of
current in heart tissue. In order to limit the current in
the event of a short-circuit, inductances are arranged in
the pulse-generating discharge circuit, and the electrodes
are supplied with biphasic pulses of current in the form of
heavily damped oscillations.A similar defibrillator is described in European patent
application EP-A-0 574 609. It supplies electrodes, applied at
different sites on the heart, with pulses with different
starting times, pulse durations and/or pulse amplitudes, so
the most favorable possible distribution of current is
achieved in heart tissue.The object of the present invention is to achieve both
chronologically and spatially optimum distribution of
current for heart defibrillation by adaptation to the
geometry of the heart.This object is achieved with a defibrillator of the type
described in the introduction above with the characterizing
features set forth in claim 1.In the defibrillator according to the invention, active
switching of the voltages in a pulse complex for heart EP-A2-0 280 526 discloses an implantable defibrillator comprising a pulse generating
means having at least three outputs to which electrodes are connectable for delivering
defibrillation pulses. Switching means are provided to reverse the polarity and/or
switch the voltages applied by the pulse generating means, between the electrodes.
Two electrodes are arranged to the left and right ventricles. 
defibrillation is thus performed during the discharge
pulses, whereby generation of a plurality of multiphasic
pulses of varying intensity, delivered to heart tissue via
the electrodes arrayed in the spatially most favorable
pattern, becomes possible. The defibrillator according to
the invention thus utilizes a.o.the lower defibrillation
thresholds achieved through the use of at least biphasic
pulses combined with the advantages involved in utilizing
pulses of varying intensity at different electrodes. In this
way, peak voltages and peak currents can be reduced, thereby
reducing the risk of damage to tissue. It should also be
noted that the polarity of the entire
