characterized in that they contain a ceramide of formula (S): 


 
and a linoleic acid source, which is a vegetable oil rich in 

linoleic acid. 
Dermatological or cosmetic compositions as defined in 
claim 1, characterized in that the ceramide content is 0.01 

to 15%. 
Dermatological or cosmetic compositions as defined in 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the ceramide content is 

0.1 to 1%. 
Dermatological or cosmetic compositions as defined in 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the linoleic acid source 

is a vegetable oil containing at least 50% linoleic acid. 
Dermatological or cosmetic compositions as defined in 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the content of oil rich 

in linoleic acid can vary from 2 to 10%. 
Compositions as defined in claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that they are presented in the form of: 


simple water-in-oil emulsions, 
simple oil-in-water emulsions, 
a triple water-in-oil-in-water emulsion, 
complex emulsions containing liquid crystals forming 
lipidic double layers surrounding the oily phases, 
pseudo-emulsions (dispersion of an oily phase or a water-in-oil 
emulsion in a gelatinized aqueous phase, without 

traditional surfactants), 
a pseudo-emulsion or dispersion of an oily phase dispersed 
in an aqueous phase and stabilized with Lubragel (R), Pemulen  

 
(R), Hypan (R), xanthan gum, CMC, hydroxyethyl cellulose, 

Amigel (R), Polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, Amercell HM1500 (R), or a 
mixture of two or more of these gelatinizing agents. 
Use as a cosmetic product of the compositions according 
to claims 1 to 5. 
Cosmetic treatment method for restoring the barrier 
function of the stratum corneum of dry and very dry skin, 

characterized in that a sufficient quantity of a cosmetic 
composition as defined according to any one of claims 1 to 5
