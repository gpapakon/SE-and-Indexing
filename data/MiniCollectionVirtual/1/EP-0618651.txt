<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface emitting 
laser provided with a light modulator. As an external modulator for changing the light 
intensity of a semiconductor laser, one is known which is 
made by forming an n-InP cladding layer 2, InGaAsP quantum 
well layer 3, and p-InP cladding layer 4 on an n-InP 
substrate 1 in order by means of epitaxial growth and 
forming a p-electrode 5 on the cladding layer 4 and an n-electrode 
6 under the substrate 1 as shown in Fig. 1A. 
The external light modulator changes the absorption 
wavelength of the light passing through the quantum well 
layer 3 to perform light modulation by using the 
characteristic that the light absorption coefficient of 
the quantum well layer 3 is changed due to a change of the 
electric field in the quantum well layer 3. Since this type of light modulator requires a long 
waveguide, the overall thickness of a device increases by 
mounting the light modulator on a surface emitting laser. Therefore the absorption loss increases and the 
optical output decreases when the electric field of the 
light modulator is not generated. A surface emitting laser free from the above problem 
is described in the official gazette of, for example, 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. Hei 4-247676. For 
this apparatus, as shown in Fig. 1B, an n-InP buffer layer 
8, saturable absorption layer 9 comprising an n-InGaAs/InP 
superlattice, n-InP cladding layer 10, active layer 11 
comprising an InGaAs/InP superlattice, p-InP cladding 
layer 12, and p-InGaAs cap layer 13 are formed on an n-InP 
substrate 7 in order, high-reflectance films 14 and 15 are 
formed on the cap layer 13 and under the semiconductor  
 
substrate 7, a p-electrode 16 is formed around the high-reflectance 
film 14 on the cap layer 13, an n-electrode 
17 is formed on the outer periphery of the saturable 
absorption layer 9, and moreover an electrode 18 for 
applying an electric field to the saturable absorption 
layer 9 is formed on the outer periphery of the buffer 
layer 8. This apparatus changes the quantity of light to be 
absorbed in a resonator by the saturable absorption layer 
9 to perform light modulation by using the characteristic 
that a light absorption wavelength is changed due to the 
quantum-confinement Stark effect when applying an electric 
field to the saturable absorption layer 9. For the structure in which the light modulator is 
formed in the resonator, however, current also flows to 
the saturable absorption layer 9 when it flows from the 
p-electrode 16 to
