<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns novel IL-5 inhibiting 6-azauracil derivatives useful for treating eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases; to processes for their preparation and compositions comprising them. It further relates to their use as a medicine.Eosinophil influx, leading to subsequent tissue damage, is an important pathogenic event in bronchial asthma and allergic diseases. The cytokine interleukin-5 (IL-5), produced mainly by T lymphocytes as a glycoprotein, induces the differentiation of eosinophils in bone marrow and, primes eosinophils for activation in peripheral blood and sustains their survival in tissues. As such, IL-5 plays a critical role in the process of eosinophilic inflammation. Hence, the possibility that inhibitors of IL-5 production would reduce the production, activation and/or survival of eosinophils provides a therapeutic approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma and allergic diseases such as, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and also other eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases.Steroids, which strongly inhibit IL-5 production in vitro, have long been used as the only drugs with remarkable efficacy for bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, but they cause various serious adverse reactions such as diabetes, hypertension and cataracts. Therefore, it would be desirable to find non-steroidal compounds having the ability to inhibit IL-5 production in human T-cells and which have little or no adverse reactions.US 4,631,278 discloses a-aryl-4-(4,5-dihydro-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-triazin-2(3H)-yl)benzeneacetonitriles and US 4,767,760 discloses 2-(substituted phenyl)-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-diones, all having anti-protozoal activity, in particular, anticoccidial activity. EP 831,088 discloses 1,2,4-triazine-3,5-diones as anticoccidial agents. Unexpectedly, the 6-azauracil derivatives of the present invention prove to be potent inhibitors of the production of IL-5.The present invention is concerned with the compounds of formula

the N-oxides, the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, wherein :
prepresents an integer being 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4;qrepresents an integer being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5;Xrepresents O, S, NR3 or a direct bond;R1represents hydrogen, hydroxy, halo, amino, mono- or di(C1-4alkyl)amino, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkyloxy, C3-7cycloalkyl, aryl, arylC1-6alkyl, aminoC1-4alkyl, mono- or di(C1-4alkyl)aminoC1-4alkyl or mono- or di(C1-4alkyl)aminoC1-4alkylamino;R2represents aryl, Het1, C3-7cycloalkyl,
