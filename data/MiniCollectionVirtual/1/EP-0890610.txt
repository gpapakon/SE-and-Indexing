<ABSTRACT>
A highly saturated nitrile group-containing copolymer
rubber having a Mooney viscosity lowered by 15 points or more

by applying a high shearing force thereto in the presence of
an aging inhibitor, which has a Mooney viscosity of 5 - 35 and

a weight average molecular weight/number average molecular
weight ratio of 3 - 5, and exhibits an increase in Mooney

viscosity of 10 points or fewer while the rubber is allowed to
stand in the air at room temperature for 30 days. The viscosity

of the copolymer rubber changes only to a minor extent with the
lapse of time, and the copolymer rubber has excellent

processability and storage stability. The copolymer rubber
can be used as a heat-resistant rubber composition comprising

the copolymer rubber and other heat-resistant rubber. The
copolymer rubber can be used as a composite thereof with a fiber,

which has good mechanical strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a highly saturated nitrile
group-containing copolymer rubber with an enhanced
processability having a Mooney viscosity lowered by imparting
thereto a high shearing stress; a process for producing the
same; a composition comprising the nitrile group-containing
copolymer rubber with a lowered Mooney viscosity and a
heat-resistant rubber; and a composite of the highly saturated
nitrile group-containing copolymer rubber with a fiber.A highly saturated nitrile group-containing copolymer
rubber, i.e., a hydrogenation product of an unsaturated
nitrile-conjugated diene copolymer rubber, is known as having
excellent heat resistance, oil resistance and weather
resistance. A vulcanizate having reinforcing fibers
integrated therewith by imparting high tenacity
characteristics thereto also is known. The rubber used for the
fiber-reinforced rubber vulcanizate must have good fluidity or
processability so that the rubber penetrates into and
thoroughly filled in voids among the reinforcing fibers to give
a vulcanizate having sufficiently high tenacities.To impart a good processability to a highly saturated
nitrile copolymer rubber, a process has been proposed wherein
its Mooney viscosity is lowered by applying a high shearing
force to the rubber (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
H3-122103). The proposed process comprises imparting a high
shearing stress to a hydrogenated nitrile rubber with a Mooney
viscosity of from 55 to 100 in the presence of an oxygen donor
such as oxygen or a peroxide compound and a radical transferring 
agent whereby the rubber is subject to thermal-oxidative
degradation so that the Mooney viscosity is reduced to a value
of from 30 to 50.In the proposed process, free radicals generated upon the
thermal-oxidative degradation are stabilized by an oxygen
donor. It has been found that the rubber gels due to peroxides,
a carboxyl group and carbonyl group, remaining after the
high-shearing-force applying treatment. Even if a
conventional aging inhibitor is added to the rubber after the
high-shearing-force applying treatment, the Mooney viscosity
increases during storage of the rubber.
GB 1,359,227 discloses a method of treating rubber to reducethe
molecular weight and Mooney viscosity, wherein a solution of
the rubber is passed through a homogenizer under a high pressure.
It is taught that the Mooney viscosity of rubber is reduced by
from 10 to 80% during the treatment (page 3, lines 106-108; claim
19).GB 1,359,227 specifically discloses a treatment of NBR
in Example
