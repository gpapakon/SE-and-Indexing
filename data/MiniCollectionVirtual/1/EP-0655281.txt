<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid-jet nozzle (1) for ejecting a progressively 
flattening jet (6) of cleaning liquid at high pressure, 

said liquid-jet nozzle being of the kind comprising 

a) a nozzle aperture (5) extending through an end 
wall (7) extending transversely to the main direction 

of flow of the liquid jet (6), 
 
b) upstream of the nozzle aperture (5) and opening 
into the latter an inlet chamber (2) connected to 

the outlet of the liquid pump (3) of the high-pressure 
cleaner, and 
 
c) in the upstream side of the end wall (7), an elongate 
recess (8), the longitudinal central axis of 

which intersects the central axis of the nozzle 
aperture (5) at right angles, 
 
the new feature consists in 


d) that the recess (8) is oval and consists of ipsilaterally 
concavely curved surfaces extending 

smoothly into each other so as to form a continuous 
surface without sudden transitions or sharp edges. 
 
With this arrangement, turbulence is avoided in the inlet 

chamber (2) and in the nozzle aperture (5) itself, so 
that the jet (6) can flatten progressively so as to form 

a very sharp profile (6d) functioning almost like the 
edge of a scraper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid-jet nozzle of 
the kind set forth in the preamble of claim 1. A liquid-jet nozzle of the kind referred to above is 
known from the German published specification 
No. 4,213,226. In this known nozzle, the recess formed 
in the upstream side of the end wall has a rather complicated 
shape, partly comprising spherical surfaces, partly 
"side walls" in continuation of said spherical surfaces, 
the transitions between the various surfaces being constituted 
by sharp edges. The shape of the recess referred to as known from the 
above document is the cause of certain disadvantages, 
both with regard to the flow conditions and with regard 
to the manufacture of the nozzles. With regard to the 
flow conditions it is reasonable to believe that the 
complicated shape of the recess, especially the sharp 
edges referred to, will create turbulence in the issuing 
liquid jet and prevent the flattening of the liquid jet 
from occurring as smoothly as possible. With regard to 
the manufacture of the nozzle, the complicated shape of 
the recess makes it impossible to produce it by means of 
e.g. milling operations, but demands the use of specially 
designed embossing or stamping tools, that can only be 
used, if the material of the nozzle lends itself to being 
shaped by embossing or stamping.  
 On this background, it is the object of the present invention 
to provide a nozzle of the kind referred to initially, 
that both with regard to flow conditions and 
manufacture represents an improvement of the known nozzle 
referred to above, and this object is achieved with a 
nozzle, according to the present invention additionally 
exhibiting the features set forth in the characterizing 
clause of claim 1. Since the recess shaped in accordance 
with the invention does not comprise complicated surfaces 
with sharp edges as in the known nozzles, the risk of 
turbulence is considerably reduced, providing improved 
possibilities for a smooth flattening of the jet. In the 
nozzle according to the invention, the recess in the 
upstream side of the end wall may be formed by a simple 
milling or grinding process using a milling or grinding 
tool, respectively, with a rounded end, that may be moved 
back and forth transversely of the longitudinal direction 
of the nozzle during the machining operation. Practical 
trials with the nozzle according to the invention have 
shown that the liquid jet flattens in such a manner, 
that at a certain distance from the mouth of the nozzle, 
it becomes
