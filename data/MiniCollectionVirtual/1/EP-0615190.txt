<ABSTRACT>
A memory system utilizes a variable number of 
separately replaceable memory banks (65) which can be 

implemented with memory elements (73), such as dynamic random 
access memory (DRAM) chips, which are of differing speeds 

and/or sizes. A programmable address decoder (91) contains 
a writable memory (95) and is controlled by a diagnostic 

interface (96) coupled to the memory banks, to implement an 
interleaving of memory addresses among the memory banks as a 

function of the number of banks actually present. 
Successive memory accesses are thus not unnecessarily delayed 

by the recovery times of the memory elements, and 
furthermore, any memory bank can be operationally removed 

from the system without physical disconnection. Delay 
elements (111,113,115) delay timing signals from the memory 

banks by an amount corresponding to the speed of the DRAM 
chips, so that chips of differing speeds can be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory system 
for a digital computer. As is understood by those skilled in the art, the 
main directly addressable memory utilized by digital 
computers is typically implemented by so-called dynamic 
random access memory integrated circuits or chips (D RAMS). 
In such integrated circuits, each bit of data is stored as a 
charge in a capacitance which is included in each memory 
cell. The cells are typically arranged in a matrix and 
individual cells are accessed by providing row and column 
addresses which are utilized to read out the stored charge 
when a row address strobe signal (RAS) and a column address 
strobe signal (CAS) are applied. Because of the collective 
capacitances associated with the lines through which the RAS 
and CAS signals are applied, there is an inherent recovery 
time associated with precharging each of those lines. This 
recovery time must pass before that line is again used for a 
cell access, the delay for the RAS signal being typically 
substantially longer than that for the CAS signal. 
Accordingly, it is desirable to map memory addresses 
according to an interleaving scheme so that addresses which 
appear successive to the processor are, in fact, physically 
in different memory elements. Typically, however, such 
memory mapping and interleave schemes are fixed and 
predetermined for an entire memory system regardless of its 
size. Further, prior art memory systems typically utilize 
fixed timing throughout the memory system so that all memory 
elements must provide access to valid data within a  
 
predetermined minimum time which is common throughout the 
memory system. Accordingly, if it is desired to utilize 
faster memory elements in any part of the memory address 
space, all memory elements, e.g., D RAMS, must be replaced 
with the faster components. As is understood, with 
computer systems of the type which are generally classified 
as midrange computers, replacement of the entire random 
access memory can be a very expensive undertaking. The invention in its various aspects is defined in 
the independent claims below, to which reference should now 
be made. Advantageous features of the invention are set 
forth in the appendant claims. A preferred embodiment of the invention is 
described in more detail below which comprises an expandable 
memory subsystem which provides connections for data signals 
and a plurality of system address signals to a predetermined 
number of separately replaceable memory banks and which 
includes means
