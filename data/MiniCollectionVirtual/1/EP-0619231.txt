<ABSTRACT>
A packaging machine, especially one for packing 
cigarettes or the like, comprises a feeder/gatherer (3, 

103) of cigarettes in ordered groups from a magazine of 
loose cigarettes (2), a first forming unit (5, 6) which 

forms a foil wrapping, a second forming unit (13, 14, 15) 
which forms a hard- or soft-type packet wrapping around 

said groups of cigarettes (12) wrapped in the foil 
wrapping, means for feeding the packaging material (10, 

28, 48), such as sheets of foil and, depending on the 
types of packaging, wrapping sheets (44) and transverse 

closure strips (47) or one or more blank parts (130, 31) 
constituting various parts of a hard packet, and also a 

magazine (18, 19) for storing discharged finished packets 
(20). According to the invention, the working parts of 

the machine and the path followed by the products in 
various stages of packaging are distributed and interconnected 

within a small vertical space in such a way that 
the working parts and the products are directly accessible, 

visually and manually, to the operative personnel.
