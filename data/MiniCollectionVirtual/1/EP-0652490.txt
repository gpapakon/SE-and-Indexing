<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic particles
and a process for producing the magnetic particles and
more in detailed, the present invention relates to magnetic
particles for a magnetic toner which have a high fluidity,
a low oil absorption, an excellent charging stability and a
good initial dispersibility, and a process for producing
such magnetic particles.Hitherto, a development method of using as a developer
composite particles prepared by mixing and dispersing
magnetic particles such as magnetite particles in a resin
without using a carrier, so-called one-component magnetic
toner, has been widely known and used as one of the
electrostatic latent image development methods.With the enhancement of the image qualities such as
image density and gradient and the increase of printing
speed of the copying machines in the recent years, more 
improvements of the properties of the magnetic toner used
as a developer are demanded. That is, a magnetic toner is
required to have an improved developing-stability so as to
allow copying with a uniform image density, a high
durability so as to enable clear and uniform copying even
after repetition of copying, an excellent environmental
stability so as to allow normal copying even under the low-temperature
and low-humidity condition or high-temperature
and high-humidity condition, as well as excellent fluidity
and charging stability.Regarding the durability of magnetic toner, Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 4-162051 states:
"Further, since the copying machines are trending toward
higher printing speed, a toner is required to satisfy the
high-level requirements for high resolution, high-speed
development, high durability, etc. ···"As to the developing stability and fluidity of
magnetic toner, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
(KOKAI) No. 53-94932 describes: "Such high-resistance
magnetic toner is poor in fluidity because of high
resistance and tends to cause uneven development. That is,
the high-resistance toner for PPC can retain the electric
charges necessary for transfer, but since there remains a
small amount of charges in the toner bottle or on the
surfaces of the magnetic rolls even in the steps (other
than the transfer step) where no charging is necessary, due
to the frictional charging or mechanoelectret in the toner 
producing process, the agglomeration of particles tends to
take place, thereby causing lowering of fluidity." and
"Another object of the present invention is to provide a
high-resistance toner for PPC having an improved
