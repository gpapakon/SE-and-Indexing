<ABSTRACT>
A radio frequency filter comprising several resonator circuits, such as duplex 
filter, is provided with a given passband. Signal frequencies generating 

spurious response, mirror frequencies, etc. can be effectively attenuated so 
that the filter comprises one more resonator circuit connected as a bandstop 

circuit. That comprises a transmission line resonator (Res), a series 
connection of an inductive element (MLIN2) and a capacitance diode (D), one 

end of the series connection being coupled to a coupling point in the 
transmission line resonator, dividing it into two parts (TLIN1, TLIN2), and the 

other end being coupled to the output connector (1) of the radio frequency 
filter. In addition, means are provided for carrying the direct voltage (V+) to 

the cathode of the capacitance diode, whereby the series resonance 
frequency changes according to the control voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio frequency filter, In particular a filter
for attenuating spurious responses from a receiver mixer of a radio telephone.In radio telephones, a received radio signal is usually coupled from an antenna
to a duplex filter from where it is passed through a first amplifier located in
the front end of the receiver. The received signal is then passed through a
fixed bandpass filter to a first mixer where it is mixed with a local oscillator
frequency, to yield an intermediate frequency which is filtered from the
general mixer response. The intermediate frequency signal is amplified prior
to be taken to a second mixer. To reduce component costs and to simplify
the basic structure of a receiver, it would be advantageous to select a low
intermediate frequency. However, the selection of a low intermediate
frequency, may cause difficulties not solvable by means of fixed filters. For
example, the attenuation of signals such as local oscillator signals, which are
at a distance of the intermediate frequency from a signal to be received and
mirror frequency signals, which are at twice the distance of the intermediate
frequency from the receiving band, may be difficult to achieve.A spurious response signal is generally higher than the received Rf signal by
half of the intermediate frequency if the local oscillator injection frequency is
located on the upper side of the received signal (the local oscillator frequency
is higher than the frequency to be received). Conversely it is half of the
intermediate frequency lower than the received Rf signal if the local oscillator
injection signal is located on the lower side of the received signal (the local
oscillator frequency is lower than the frequency to be received).When the intermediate frequency is sufficiently high relative to the receiving
band, i.e. higher by at least twice the width of the reception band, the 
frequency components generating a spurious response can be filtered by
means of fixed filters in the high frequency components of the receiver. For
this purpose, the first intermediate frequency is in general selected to be
sufficiently high, as described above, although the components to be used
are more difficult to produce and therefore more expensive. For example, in
the NMT radio telephone system, the width of the receiving band is 25 MHz
and the intermediate frequency over 50 MHz. e.g. 87 MHz. In certain radio
telephone systems attenuation required in the telephone to overcome the
spurious response is so high that the
