<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor
memories, and in particular to a method and apparatus
for accelerated column access in dynamic random access
memories (DRAMs) and static random access memories
(SRAMs).The description below relates to DRAMs,
although the invention can be applied equally well to
SRAMs, and should be construed as such.DRAMs are typically formed of orthogonally
disposed word lines and bit lines, with charge storage
cells adjacent each intersection addressed via the
wordlines and connected to the bit lines. Each charge
storage cell stores a charge received from a bit line
when it is addressed, that designates the value (0 or 1)
of a bit. Bit lines are typically in a well known
folded form, formed of two conductors, that interface a
data bus via a sense amplifier and column access
devices, such as field effect switches that are
addressed via a column decoder.Pertinent circuitry of a typical prior art
DRAM is illustrated in Figure 1. A charge storage cell
is formed of a capacitor 1 connected in series with a
field effect transistor 2 (FET) between a voltage supply
Vcp and a conductor of a folded bitline 3. The gate of
the FET is connected to a wordline 4. The bitline is
connected to a sense amplifier 5. Each output conductor
of the sense amplifier is connected through an FET 6 to
a corresponding conductor of a data bus 8. The gates of
FETs 6 are connected together to the output of a column
decoder, which provides the control signal Yi, which is
a decoded column address signal to those gates.The conductors of data bus 8 are connected
differentially to the input of a read amplifier 9, and 
to the output of a write amplifier 10. A source of
precharge voltage Vcc/2 is connected through FETs 11 to
corresponding conductors of the data bus 8. The
conductors of data bus 8 are connected together through
FET 12. The gates of transistors 11 and 12 are
connected together and to a source of a precharge enable
control signal, PRE. A write enable signal WMA is
provided to a control input of the write amplifier, and
a read enable signal RMA is provided to a control input
of the read amplifier.In operation, with reference to the signal
waveforms illustrated in Figure 2A, a precharge enable
signal PRE is applied to FETs 11 and 12, causing the
data bus to be precharged to Vcc/2. As shown by the
waveform PRE, the precharge enable pulse goes to low
logic level, and during that interval the decoded
column address signal Yi is applied to FETs 6. As a
result charge stored on the bitlines resulting from
sensing
