<ABSTRACT>
Twin roll caster for continuously casting metal
strip comprises a pair of parallel casting rolls (16) to

which molten metal is supplied through a delivery nozzle
(19). The rolls are mounted on roll carriers (104)

moveable on a frame (102) to allow rolls (16) to move
toward and away from one another. Biasing units (110, 111)

allow inward biasing forces to be applied to the roll
carriers (104) so as to bias one of the rolls (104) toward

the other. The biasing units (110) incorporate biasing
springs and means to adjust the thrust exerted by the

springs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the casting of metal
strip. It has particular application to the casting of
metal strip by continuous casting in a twin roll caster.In a twin roll caster molten metal is introduced
between a pair of contra-rotated horizontal casting rolls
which are cooled so that metal shells solidify on the
moving roll surfaces and are brought together at the nip
between them to produce a solidified strip product
delivered downwardly from the nip between the rolls. The
term "nip" is used herein to refer to the general region at
which the rolls are closest together. The molten metal may
be poured from a ladle into a smaller vessel or series of
smaller vessels from which it flows through a metal
delivery nozzle located above the nip so as to direct it
into the nip between the rolls, so forming a casting pool
of molten metal supported on the casting surfaces of the
rolls immediately above the nip and extending along the
length of the nip. This casting pool is usually confined
between side plates or dams held in sliding engagement with
end surfaces of the rolls so as to dam the two ends of the
casting pool against outflow, although alternative means
such as electromagnetic barriers have also been proposed.The setting up and adjustment of the casting
rolls in a twin roll caster is a significant problem. The
rolls must be accurately set to properly define an
appropriate width for the nip, generally the order of only
a few millimetres, and there must also be some means for
allowing at least one of the rolls to move outwardly
against a biasing force to accommodate fluctuations in
strip thickness particularly during start up. Previously
proposed arrangements have employed roll mounting and
biasing means in which require relative sliding movement
between separate components at several locations, resulting
in several sources of friction loading which interferes 
with accurate positioning of the rolls and accurate measurement of the roll biasing
forces. The present invention provides a novel roll biasing system which minimises
the sources of friction during operation.In JP 05 261486A upon which the preamble of the appended claims is based (Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 018, no. 023) there
is described a twin roll caster in which each roll is mounted in a pair of main bearing
boxes slidably guided in a frame to permit movement of the rolls towards each other
under the influence of biasing devices acting on the main bearing boxes, and
preloading springs act on further bearing boxes to urge the rolls apart

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for continuously casting metal strip comprising a pair of
parallel casting rolls (16) forming a nip between them; metal delivery means

(17,18,19) to deliver molten metal into the nip between the rolls to form a casting
pool (30) of molten metal supported on casting roll surfaces immediately above the

nip; pool confining means (56) to confine the molten metal in the casting pool (30)
against outflow from the ends of the nip; and roll drive means (41) to drive the

casting rolls in counter-rotational directions to produce a solidified strip of metal
delivered downwardly from the nip; at least one of the casting rolls (16) being

mounted on a pair of moveable roll carriers (104) which allow that one roll (16) to
move bodily toward and away from the other roll (16); and a pair of roll biasing

units (110) acting one on each of the pair of moveable roll carriers (164) to bias said
one roll (16) bodily inwardly toward the other roll (16), 
characterised in that
 each
roll biasing unit (110) comprises:


a spring housing barrel (114);
a fixed barrel mounting (115) adjacent the respective roll carrier;
the barrel (114) being moveable on the fixed barrel mounting (115)
between a retracted position and an extended position adjacent the respective roll

carrier;
compression spring means (112) housed within the barrel (114);
a thrust transmission structure (122) slidably mounted in one end of
the barrel (114) so as to be abutted by the spring means (112);
a thrust reaction structure (121) slidably mounted in the other end of
the barrel (114) so as be abutted by the spring means (112);
bias adjustment means (119) mounted on the barrel (114) so as to be
moveable with it and operable to move the thrust reaction structure (121) along the

barrel to alter the effective gap between the thrust transmission structure (122) and
the thrust reaction structure (121) within the barrel thereby to adjust the thrust

exerted by the spring means;
releasable clamping means (123,124) operable to clamp the thrust
structure (122) to the roll carrier (104) when the barrel is in its extended position;

and
the barrel (114) being settable in the extended position with the 
clamping means (123, 124) conditioned to clamp the thrust transmission structure to

the roll carrier (104) whereby thrust is transmitted from the spring means to that roll
carrier with the barrel (114) serving as a fixed structure to absorb the reaction to the

thrust, and the barrel on release of the clamping means being movable to the
retracted position for the thrust transmission structure (122) to be drawn away from

the roll carrier (104).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further 
characterised in that
 said
adjustment means comprises a powered mechanical jack (119) mounted on said

other end of the barrel (114) and operatively connected to the thrust reaction
structure (121).

between the roll carriers to serve as a fixed stop to limit inward bodily movement of

the roll carrier (104) under the thrust of the spring means, said stop means (107)
being adjustable in width to vary the minimum width of the nip.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, further 
characterised in that
 the roll
carriers (104) comprise a pair of roll end support structures for each of the rolls

Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, further 
characterised in that
