<ABSTRACT>
A method of assessing the cardiovascular 
performance of a subject, by: applying periodically, in 

synchronism with every n
th
 heart cardiac cycle wherein "n" 
is at least two, external pressure pulsations on a 

peripheral organ of the subject sufficient to alter 
ventricular loading; acquiring data representative of the 

ventricular pressure, and data representative of the 
ventricular volume, of the subject's heart over a plurality 

of heart cardiac cycles; and utilizing such data for 
assessing the cardiovascular performance of the subject. 

Ventricular loading may be altered by impeding ventricular 
ejection (changing afterload), and/or by altering venous 

return to the heart (changing preload).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for assessing the cardiovascular performance of a 
subject, particularly for diagnosing and/or monitoring 
treatment of patients with ischemic heart diseases (IHD) or 
with heart failure (HF). US Patent 4,877,035, which is hereby incorporated 
by reference, discloses a technique for determining the 
end-systolic elastance (Ees) of a subject's heart. Ees is 
generally accepted as an index of myocardial contactility, a 
characteristic very useful in assessing the cardiovascular 
performance of the subject. As described in this patent, 
Ees is determined by measuring the end-systolic pressure-volume 
relation in which the afterload is varied by the 
controlled inflation of an intraaortic balloon catheter 
positioned in the ascending aorta. Balloon inflation is 
timed to transiently interrupt ventricular ejection at 
different times during the ejection phase, producing 
contraction at different ventricular volumes. Simultaneous 
measurements of left ventricular pressure and aortic volume 
during the occlusion sequence allows pressure vs. ejected 
volume loops to be generated, from which the slope of the 
end-systolic pressure-volume relationship can be 
determined. The technique described in the above patent, 
however, is extremely limited in clinical practice because 
of the complex invasive procedure required, namely the 
introduction and controlled inflation of the intraaortic 
balloon. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel, non-invasive method, and also an apparatus, for 
assessing the cardiovascular performance of a subject. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of assessing the cardiovascular  
 
performance of a subject, comprising: applying 
periodically, in synchronism with every nth heart cardiac 
cycle wherein "n" is at least two, external pressure 
pulsations on a peripheral organ of the subject sufficient 
to alter ventricular loading; acquiring data representative 
of the ventricular pressure, and data representative of the 
ventricular volume, of the subject's heart over a plurality 
of heart cardiac cycles; and utilizing the data for 
assessing the cardiovascular performance of the subject. The ventricular loading may be altered by impeding 
ventricular ejection (changing afterload), and/or by 
altering venous return (changing preload). The invention also provides apparatus for 
assessing the cardiovascular performance of a subject in 
accordance with the above method. As will be described
