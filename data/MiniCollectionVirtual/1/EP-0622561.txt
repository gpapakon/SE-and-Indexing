<ABSTRACT>
A gas spring (10) comprises a first bypass with a 
one-way valve (34) that allows fluid to bypass the 

piston (26) when the piston (26) moves outward and a 
second bypass with a temperature-compensating spring-biased 

one-way valve (38) that allows fluid to bypass 
the piston (26) when the piston (26) is pushed inward 

with a force exceeding the total of the force due to the 
gas pressure of the gas spring (10) and the force 

required to open the spring-biased valve (38). Variations 
due to temperature changes in the force required to 

retract the gas spring are minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
Gas springs are widely used to counterbalance the 
engine compartment hoods, trunk lids, rear windows, and 
tailgates of passenger cars, station wagons, and vans 
to facilitate opening them and to hold them open at or 
near a fully open position. It is well known that the 
force outputs of gas springs vary with the temperature 
of the gas (Boyle's law); at low temperatures, a gas 
spring produces a force that is significantly less than 
the force it produces at high temperatures. It is 
necessary, therefore, to design the gas spring so that 
it produces a sufficient force to hold the hood, trunk 
lid or the like (hereinafter referred to as the "load") 
open at a suitably selected low temperature, for 
example, -30°C. (Conventionally, the gas spring is 
designed to produce a force of about one to five pounds 
over the load at the hold-open position of the load at, 
say, -30°C.) At high temperatures, the increase in the 
force output at the hold-open position may be as much 
as, say, 50 pounds, which means that the force required 
to move the load from the hold-open position toward 
closed ("handle load") is 50 pounds. A handle load of 
that magnitude is obviously undesirable.  
 U. S. Patent No. 5,106,065 (Staton, Apr. 21, 
1992), which is owned by the assignee of the present 
invention, describes and shows a gas spring that incorporates 
a bypass having a spring-biased valve that 
prevents fluid flow past the piston from the closed end 
to the rod seal end of the chamber until a predetermined 
force due to a pressure differential is applied 
across the piston and a bypass having a thermostatic 
valve, which opens at a predetermined temperature and 
permits fluid in the chamber to flow past the piston 
from the closed end to the rod seal end of the chamber. 
When the thermostatic valve is closed, the spring-biased 
valve provides a hold-open force that is combined 
with the force due to the gas pressure to hold 
the gas spring against a load (handle load). When the 
thermostatic valve is open, the hold-open force of the 
gas spring is that due to the gas pressure alone, inasmuch 
as the fluid flows across the piston through the 
bypass with the thermostatic valve. The gas springs disclosed in Patent No. 5,106,065 
provide a significant improvement over prior art gas 
springs in that the variation of the handle load due to 
temperature changes is considerably reduced. On the 
other hand, they do not eliminate variations in the 
handle load, inasmuch as they do not prevent changes in 
the handle load as

end of the cylinder member (12), a piston rod (18)

closure (16), a piston (26;100) affixed to the 
piston rod (18) within the chamber(IC,OC) and having 

sealing means (30) and valve means (34,38;34',38'; 
110,106,116) separating the chamber (IC,OC) into an 

inward compartment (IC) adjacent said one end of the 
cylinder and an outward compartment (OC) adjacent 

said other end of the cylinder, the volumes of the 
compartments (IC,OC) varying in accordance with the 

position of the piston (26;100), a mass of a liquid

gas to flow from the outward compartment (OC) to the 
inward compartment (IC) when the piston (26;100) and 

rod (18) move in the direction of the outward  
 

compartment (OC) in response to forces (OF) imposed

valve means (34;34';110) for closing the first 
bypass to prevent flow of gas and liquid therethrough

piston (26;100) are moved toward the inward 
compartment (IC), means (46,36,40;40';104) on the 

piston (26;100) defining a second bypass for permitting 
the gas and liquid to flow from the inward 

compartment (IC) to the outward compartment (OC) 
upon movement of the rod (18) toward the inward 

compartment (IC), and a spring-biased one-way 
valve means (38;38';106,116) associated with the
