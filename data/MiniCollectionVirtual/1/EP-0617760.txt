<ABSTRACT>
A peg (5) for fastening a rail (1) having a longitudinal, straight T-groove (2) on its lower side has a flat disk-shaped head (4) held in the groove so as to allow the peg to move and to turn in the groove. The peg is cranked between the head and a shaft (7) to be driven into a hole bored in the floor and is linked in a single piece to the head by a transversal part (8), so that an elongated rail (1) used for example to secure adjacent carpet edges may be easily fastened to the floor even when the holes bored in the floor are not aligned along a straight line. Thanks to the right-angle bend of the peg, the shafts (7) of the pegs may also be driven into holes laterally offset from the straight line.

<CLAIMS>
Rail-fastening peg for fastening a rail, having a longitudinal straight 
groove, on a substrate having a row of holes, consisting of a synthetic body 

being cranked between a head to be positioned into the longitudinal 
groove and an anchoring part of the peg to be anchored in the substrate 

and being linked to the head by a transversal part, characterized in that 
the anchoring part is formed as a shaft (7) being connected in a single 

peace to the tranversal part and having a plurality of circumferrential ribs 
for a tight fit anchoring effected by deformation of the ribs and that the 

transversal part (8) between the head (4) and the shaft (7) has an area of 
reduced cross-section as predetermined bending point to allow the shaft 

to be bent and / or rotated relativ to the head. 
Rail-fastening peg according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
transversal part (8) has indentations (10) in its opposing edges between 

the head (4) and the shaft (7) and the central portion of the tranversal part 
(8) remaining between the indentations being the predetermined bending 

point. 
Rail-fastening peg according to claim 1, characterized in that the axial 
distance between the head (4) and the shaft (7) corresponds at least 

approximatively to half the width of the head. 
Rail-fastening peg according to claim 1, characterized in that the head 
(4) of the fastining peg for an extension upwards is adapted to be 

connected to an intermediate piece (9) having a T-formed groove in its 
underside and on its upper side a head substantially identical to the head 

(4) of the fastening peg.
