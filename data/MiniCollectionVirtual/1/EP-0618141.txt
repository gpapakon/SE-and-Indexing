<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for reproducing inscriptions on 
containers of any form or type or on labels applied to them, 

directly on the packaging line. The desired inscription is 
thermally reproduced, directly on the packaging line, by laser or 

heated heads on a limited region of the containers which has been 
previously covered with a layer of thermosensitive recording 

material or ink, without danger of contaminating or damaging the 
containers, without requiring bulky equipment, and at a high 

reproduction rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for reproducing inscriptions on 
containers directly on the packaging line, and also relates to the 
containers obtained in this manner and to the containers to be 
subjected to said reproduction method. The containers concerned can be of the most diverse forms (large 
or small boxes, bags etc.), be constructed of different materials, 
and be intended to contain any product (in particular 
pharmaceutical or food products). Inscriptions such as words or dates often have to be reproduced 
either on containers or on labels applied to them, directly on the 
machine or line on which the products to be contained in the 
containers are fed into them or on which the final packaging of 
the containers takes place. For example the expiry date, or price, or a series number has to 
be reproduced on containers for drugs or food products, such data 
not being able to be determined much beforehand and hence not 
being able to be printed when the containers are initially printed 
and prepared by the paper processing firm. The aforesaid inscriptions (which as stated have to be reproduced 
on the line or plant in which the containers are filled or 
packaged) are currently reproduced by ink jets sprayed onto the 
boxes, or by printing by ink applied by an inked printing head, or 
by dry punches which locally deform the containers to leave the  
 
desired impression on them, or by applying labels previously 
printed with the desired inscription to such containers. All these methods have considerable drawbacks, such as a 
relatively high cost, a slow-down in the container packaging rate, 
the need to position (to the side of the packaging line) ink-containing 
vessels or printing or punching machines which are 
costly and space-consuming, or the danger that the inks used and 
in particular their volatile solvents contaminate the products 
contained in the containers, etc. The main object of the present invention is to provide a method 
which enables inscriptions to be reproduced on containers at high 
speed and at low cost directly on the packaging line, while 
avoiding the danger of contaminating the products contained in the 
containers, the risk of mechanically damaging the containers or 
the products contained in them, and the risk of contaminating such 
products, and in all cases without requiring the use of bulky 
equipment positioned to the side of the packaging line. These and further objects are attained by a method in which on a 
limited region of the containers which has been

A method for reproducing inscriptions on containers 
directly on the packaging line, characterised in that on a limited 

region of the containers which has been previously at least partly 
covered with a layer of thermosensitive recording material or ink, 

inscriptions or the like are reproduced directly on the container 
packaging line by thermal means which heat said recording material 

in correspondence only with the desired inscriptions. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
thermal means are laser beams. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
thermal means are heated profiled heads. 
A container comprising a region at least partly covered 
with a layer of thermosensitive recording material or ink on which 

inscriptions are reproduced thermally. 
A container comprising a region at least partly covered 
with a layer of thermosensitive recording material or ink which is 

to thermally receive inscriptions on a container packaging line.
