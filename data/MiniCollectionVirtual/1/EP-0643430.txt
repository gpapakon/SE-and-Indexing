<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cathode
material for lithium secondary batteries which contains
lithiated nickel dioxide, and a method for producing the
lithiated nickel dioxide which is a composite oxide, and
a lithium secondary battery.Lithiated cobalt dioxide having an α-NaFeO2
structure of hexagonal system (hereinafter sometimes
abbreviated as "lithiated cobalt dioxide") is a compound
having a structure where lithium ions and cobalt ions
are alternately and regularly arranged in layers in the
direction perpendicular to the closest-packing of oxygen
ions. Due to this structure, diffusion of lithium ions
in the layers is relatively easy and lithium ions can be
electrochemically doped or undoped. Utilizing this
property, lithiated cobalt dioxide has already been put
to practical use as a cathode material for lithium
secondary batteries for electric sources of some of
pocket telephones and video cameras. Furthermore,
lithium secondary batteries are expected as high-performance
small secondary batteries of the succeeding
generation and as electric sources for electric vehicles
or power storage apparatuses for load leveling in the
future. Thus, lithiated cobalt dioxide is being studied 
to be applied as cathode materials for lithium secondary
batteries.On the other hand, lithiated nickel dioxide
having the α-NaFeO2 structure of hexagonal system
(hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as "lithiated nickel
dioxide") is also known as a substance having the same
properties as lithiated cobalt dioxide and the lithiated
nickel dioxide is more useful because of the low cost
for starting materials and the rich resources thereof.
However, owing to difficulty in its synthesis,
researches have been mainly made on lithiated cobalt
dioxide.One reason for the difficulty in synthesis of
lithiated nickel dioxide is that upon being fired at a
high temperature exceeding 800°C, so-called rock salt
domain where lithium ions and nickel ions are
irregularly arranged (hereinafter sometimes referred to
as "rock salt domain") increasingly incorporates into
the products. Not only the rock salt domain does not
contribute to charging and discharging, but also it
hinders the reversible structural change to occur when
lithium ion is drawn out from lithiated nickel dioxide.
Therefore, if rock salt domain incorporates into
lithiated nickel dioxide, the resulting secondary
battery cannot have sufficient discharge capacity.It is known that if firing is carried out at a
low temperature of lower than 800°C for avoiding the
incorporation of
