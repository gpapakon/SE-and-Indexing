<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the separation and 
recovery of a dimeric cyclic ester of an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid from vapor 
product streams comprising the cyclic ester and hydroxylic impurities including the 
alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid. More particularly, the invention relates to a solventless 
distillation process for said separation and recovery. Still more particularly, the 
invention relates to such a solventless process wherein the vapor product stream is 
produced on depolymerizing an oligomer of an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid, the vapor 
product stream is condensed and fractionally distilled to recover the cyclic ester. Dimeric cyclic esters of hydroxycarboxylic acids such as glycoide 
(1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione) and lactide (1,4-dioxane-3,6-dimethyl-2,5-dione), are 
intermediates to high molecular weight polyhydroxycarboxylic acids which may be 
useful in biomedical and other applications because of their ability to be degraded 
biologically and hydrolytically to form physiologically and environmentally acceptable 
by-products. To achieve the high molecular weights required for such use it is 
necessary the cyclic ester be substantially free of hydroxylic (including 
hydroxycarboxylic) impurities, since such impurities prevent the attainment of the 
desired molecular weights. It is preferred the acid content of lactide, for example, be 
less than 10 milliequivalents per kilogram (meq/kg), more preferably less than 
5 meq/kg. Lactide and other dimeric cyclic esters of alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids 
are most conveniently prepared by polymerizing the corresponding alpha-hydroxyacid 
to a relatively low molecular weight (oligomeric) polyhydroxycarboxylic acid, then 
heating the oligomer, generally in the presence of a catalyst, as is well known in the art, 
to depolymerize it to the cyclic ester (lactide) which is recovered as a component of a 
vapor product stream, see for example, Gruter et al., U.S. 1,095,205 (1914); Lowe, 
U.S. 2,668,162 (1954); Bhatia, U.S. 4,835,293 (1989); DeVries, U.S. 4,797,468 
(1989); and Muller U.S. 5,053,522 (1991).  
 The vapor product stream invariably contains not only the dimeric cyclic 
ester but volatile hydroxylic impurities, among them water, the monomeric 
alpha-hydroxyacid, which is generally more volatile than the dimeric ester, and often 
higher boiling oligomers of the alpha-hydroxyacid, all of them undesirable as they are 
polymerization chain stoppers. Further, under the conditions oftypical previously known art procedures

<CLAIMS>
A solventless process for the separation and recovery of a 
dimeric cyclic ester under reduced pressure from a vapor product stream containing 

said ester and minor amounts of one or more hydroxylic impurities including an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic 
acid more volatile than the cyclic ester, water and oligomeric 

hydroxycarboxylic acid higher-boiling than the cyclic ester, which process comprises 
condensing the vapor stream to form a dimeric cyclic ester condensate, fractionally 

distilling the resulting condensate and recovering a dimeric cyclic ester fraction having a 
substantially lowered content of water alpha-hydroxy acid, and oligomeric acid wherein 

the fractional distillation is conducted continuously and comprises the steps of: 

(a) providing a multi-stage distillation column having a feed inlet at a 
midpoint of the column, an overhead vapor takeoff at the upper end of 

the column, a vapor sidestream takeoff at a point below the midpoint 
feed inlet and a high-boiler take off at the lower end of the column. 
(b) feeding the cyclic ester condensate to the midpoint of the column. 
(c) establishing in the column (i) an overhead vapor fraction consisting 
essentially of water, when present, alpha-hydoxycarboxylic acid more 

volitile than the cyclic ester and litte or no cyclic ester, (ii) a cyclic ester 
fraction takeoff below the midpoint feed inlet that is substantially free of 

water, lower-boiling acid and higher-boiling acid and (iii) a high-boiling 
fraction consisting largely of cyclic ester and higher-b
oiling oligomeric 
acids at the lower end of the column, 
(d) removing the overhead fraction from the upper end of the column, 
(e) removing the cyclic ester vapor fraction through the vapor sidestream 
takeoff and 
(f) removing the higher-boiling fraction at the lower end of the column. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the feed rate of the condensate to 
the column, the removal rate of the vapor overhead from the column, the removal rate 

of the cyclic ester fraction from the column and the removal rate of the high boiling  
 

fraction from the column are coordinated so as to establish a substantially steady state 
in the column. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the cyclic ester is a lactide, the 
hydroxycarboxylic acid is lactic acid and the oligomeric hydroxy acid is an oligomer of 

lactic acid. 
A method for the solventless separation of alpha hydroxyl 
dimeric cyclic ester under reduced pressure from a vaporous effluent from the 

depolymerization of alpha hydroxylic oligomer containing water, minor amounts of 
hydroxycarboxylic acid alpha hydroxyl dimeric cyclic ester and alpha hydroxylic 

oligomer without the addition of solvent by 

(1) partially condensing the vaporous effluent stream to remove water 
therefrom; 
2) feeding the condensate through a feed inlet to an intermediate point 
within a continuous fractionation column operating at a temperature no 

higher than 220°C to effect vaporization of the hydroxycarboxylic acid 
and the dimeric cyclic ester; 
(3) removing from the top of the column a first vapor stream containing a 
major amount of alpha hydroxylic carboxylic acid and condensing the 

first stream; 
(4) from a point below the condensate feed inlet removing a second vapor 
stream containing a major amount of dimeric cyclic ester and 

condensing the second stream; and 
(5) removing a liquid fraction from the lower end of the column containing 
a major amount of alpha hydroxylic oligomer 
The process of Claim 7 wherein the depolymerizable oligomer is an 
oligomer of L-lactic acid and the lactide product is L-lactide. 
The process of Claim 7 wherein the distillation temperature is below 
about 200°C. 
The process of Claim 7 wherein the distillation is conducted below 
about 180°C.
