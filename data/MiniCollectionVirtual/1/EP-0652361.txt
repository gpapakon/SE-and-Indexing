<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a low noise level 
internal combustion engine including a cylinder block 

(2) without a skirt portion, a supporting member (10) 
for supporting a journal portion of the crankshaft (9), 

the supporting member being fixed to a lower end portion 
of the cylinder block, a shroud (30) for suppressing an 

explosion sound in a cylinder and a bearing sound to be 
radiated out of the engine, the shroud being integrally 

formed with a cylinder head fixed to an upper side of 
the cylinder block whereby the shroud is spaced from 

the cylinder block. A noise insulating member (28) is 
disposed between the shroud and an oil pan (38) for 

increasing a flexural rigidity of the shroud and oil 
pan, whereby the present invention provides a low noise 

level internal combustion engine which can increase a 
flexural rigidity of a skirt portion without increasing 

a wall thickness of the cylinder block or using a high 
strength material, and provides a low noise level 

internal combustion engine in which a bearing cap 
supporting a journal portion of a crankshaft are 

separated from each other and assembled by a coupling 
member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low noise level
internal combustion engine and, more particularly, to an
internal combustion engine having a multi-cylinder which
can suppress engine noise transmitted to a cylinder block
from a journal portion of a crankshaft at a considerably
low level.Generally, in conventional reciprocating piston
engines, a journal portion of a crankshaft is rotatably
supported by main bearings whose upper-half parts are
carried by a cylinder block.The lower-half parts of the main bearings are carried
by bearing caps.The cylinder block is integrally provided at its
bottom portion with a skirt portion. The skirt portion is
bulged out to cover the rotating crankshaft with a space
between the crankshaft and the skirt portion. An oil pan
for reserving an engine oil is fixed to the skirt portion. With the recent trend of higher rotation and higher
output of the engine, many methods for reducing noises and
vibrations of the engine have been proposed.Since most vibrations and noises of the engine are
propagated to other portions through the cylinder block
portion of the engine and the bearing portions of the
crankshaft, it is most important to enhance the rigidity
of these parts in order to reduce the vibrations and
noises.From this point of view, a wall thickness of the
cylinder block portion is increased in thickness, or
formed of a high strength material to reduce the
vibrations and noises. However, this proposal gives rise
to another inconvenience such that the weight of the
engine itself is increased.Schemes for reducing noises and vibrations are
proposed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,213,440, 4,230,087, and
4,412,516.GB-A-200 8195 discloses an engine according to the preamble of claim 1.However, all of the schemes provide only the sound-insulating
member and do not provide means which can
increase a flexural rigidity of the skirt portion.Accordingly, the present invention has been made in
an effort to solve the above-described problems.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a low noise level internal combustion engine which can
increase a flexural rigidity of a skirt portion without
increasing a wall thickness of a cylinder block or using
a high strength material.It is another object of the present invention to
provide a low noise level internal combustion engine in
which a bearing cap supporting a journal portion of a
crankshaft are separated from each other and assembled by
a coupling means.To achieve the above objects, the present invention
provides a low noise level

<CLAIMS>
A low noise level combustion engine comprising:

a cylinder block (2) without a skirt portion;
supporting means (10) for supporting a journal
position of the crankshaft, said supporting means being

fixed to a lower end portion of said cylinder block;
a shroud (30) for suppressing an explosion sound
in a cylinder and bearing sound to be radiated out of

the engine, the shroud depending from a cylinder head (26)
fixed to an upper side of said cylinder block whereby

the shroud is spaced from the cylinder block; and characterised by noise insulating means (28), disposed between said
shroud and an oil pan (38), for increasing a flexural

rigidity of said shroud and oil pan and decreasing
noise.
A combustion engine as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the shroud comprises an upper portion (32)

disposed in parallel with said cylinder block, a lower
portion (34) widely extending from said upper portion, and

at least one rib (35) integrally formed with the upper
and lower portions to increase the rigidity of the upper

and lower portions.
A combustion engine as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein said supporting means includes an upper bearing

cap (12) having a plurality of rectangular holes (20) formed 
therethrough for providing a rotating space of balance

weights of the crankshaft and a respective lower bearing
cap (14) connected with the upper bearing cap by a bolt.
A combustion engine as claimed in claim 1, 2 or
3, wherein said noise-insulating means is formed by a

plate (48) which is bent in a right direction with respect
to a longitudinal direction of the crankshaft.
A combustion engine as claimed in claim 4,
wherein said plate comprises at least one slit (50, 52)

for transmitting oil from a crank mechanism to the oil
pan, and a plurality of grooves (60, 62; 64, 66) formed

on both sides of the slit to be lower than a surface of
the plate for increasing structural rigidity.
A combustion engine as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, in which the cylinder block is

provided with at least one case (44, 46) having a seal 42.
A combustion engine as claimed in claim 4,
wherein said plate includes a plurality of ribs (70, 72,

74, 76, 78, 80) integrally formed therewith for
increasing structural rigidity.
A combustion engine as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims in which the shroud (30) is integrally

formed with the cylinder head (26).
