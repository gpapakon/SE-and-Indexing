<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a two-part connection element, having a sleeve (1) which can be fastened on a support, in particular a motor-vehicle body, and exhibits a bead (3) in the end region (2) directed away from the support. Further provided is an insert part (4), having a shoulder (5) which engages behind the bead (3) in the installed state. In a region directed towards the support, the sleeve (1) exhibits a centric pin (8) which is mounted resiliently in the longitudinal axis A-A. The shoulder (5) of the insert part (4) comprises a plurality of arms (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4) which are resilient transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis A-A and delimit, on the inner side, an opening (7) in which the centric pin (8) is mounted.

Two-part connection element having a sleeve which 
can be fastened on a carrier, in particular a motor-vehicle 

body, and has a bead in the end region remote 
from the carrier, and having an insert part with a 

shoulder which engages behind the bead in the installed 
state, the sleeve (1; 1') having, in a region which faces 

the carrier, a central peg (8) which is mounted in a 
resilient manner in the longitudinal axis (A-A), and the 

shoulder (5) of the insert part (4; 4') comprising a 
plurality of arms (6.1 - 6.4) which are resilient transverse 

to the longitudinal axis (A-A) and, on the inside, 
delimit an opening (7) which accommodates the central 

peg (8). 
Connection element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the resilient arms (6.1 - 6.4) are 

separated from one another by slits (9) which extend 
beyond the shoulder (5) in the longitudinal direction. 
Connection element according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the slits (9) taper conically as far as 

the end region. 
Connection element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the shoulder 

sections of the arms (6.1 - 6.4) are adjoined by lateral-cylinder-surface 
sections (10.1 - 10.4) and truncated-cone 

sections (11.1 - 11.4) located in the end region. 
Connection element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the central peg (8) is arranged in the 

end region of the sleeve (1; 1') and projects approximately 
into the bottom third of the sleeve (1; 1'). 
Connection element according to Claim 5, characterized  
 

in that the tip of the peg (8) has a frusto-conical 
shape (12). 
Connection element according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the peg (8) is connected to the 

inner circumference (14) of the sleeve (1; 1'), in a 
manner resilient in the direction of the longitudinal 

axis, via at least one web (13). 
Connection element according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the peg (8) is connected to the 

sleeve (1) via 3 webs (13.1 - 13.3) distributed uniformly 
over the inner circumference (14). 
Connection element according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the three webs (13.1 - 13.3) are of a 

shape which is curved transversely with respect to the 
longitudinal axis (A-A). 
Connection element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the length (L) of 

the peg (8) is shorter than the length of the opening (7) 
in the insert part (4; 4'). 
Connection part according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the opening (7) extends through the entire 

insert part (4; 4'). 
Connection part according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the central peg (8) is 

arranged in that end region of the sleeve (1; 1') which 
faces the carrier.
