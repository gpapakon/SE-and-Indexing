<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating a 
collapsible rectangular box with four walls interconnected by folding 

lines and a bottom comprising four bottom parts (9-12) each connected 
with a wall through a folding line, said bottom parts being 

grouped in two pairs (9 and 12 or 10 and 11) at least partially 
overlapping each other in 

the folded-out position of the box and each pair comprising adjoining 
bottom parts interconnected by a folding line (17-18). In correspondence 

with the invention the box is fabricated from plastics material 
by injection molding, wherein all folding lines comprise living 

hinges made of thin sections of material. In this aspect it 
is favourable, if the box is injection molded in a position between 

its completely folded-out position and its completely collapsed 
position. Further the invention relates to a box fabricated 

using the method according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating a 
collapsible rectangular box with four walls interconnected by folding 
lines and a bottom comprising four bottom parts each connected 
with a wall through a folding line, said bottom parts being 
grouped in two pairs at least partially overlapping each other in 
the folded-out position of the box and each pair comprising adjoining 
bottom parts interconnected by a folding line. Further the 
invention relates to a box fabricated using said method. In a known method for fabricating such a collapsible 
rectangular box a flat sheet of appropriate material, mostly cardboard, 
is taken as a starting point. Next a plane sheet for forming 
the box is cut from this flat sheet. This plane sheet generally 
comprises the four aligned walls and the bottom parts each 
connected with one of the walls. Then the first and fourth wall 
are foldably interconnected (for example by bonding a strip integral 
with one of these walls onto the other wall), whereas in a 
corresponding manner also the bottom parts are interconnected two 
by two into two pairs. Like this the box is obtained in its collapsed 
position. Next the box may be extended to its folded-out 
position of use. It is a disadvantage of this known method for fabricating 
a collapsible box, that it requires a large amount of steps. 
The fabrication is particularly complicated by the necessity that, 
starting from the plane sheet, two walls and twice two bottom 
parts are to be interconnected through folding lines. It is an object of the invention to provide a method of 
the type referred to above eliminating these disadvantages in a 
simple, but nevertheless effective way. Thus the method according to the invention is characterised 
in that the box is fabricated from plastics material by injection 
molding, wherein all folding lines comprise living hinges 
made of thin sections of material. The process of injection molding enables the fabrication 
of the walls, the bottom parts and required folding lines 
therebetween in one fabrication step without the need of forming 
connections afterwards. By an appropriate choice of the injection 
mold it is possible to directly shape the folding lines as living  
 
hinges, such that after being removed from the mold the box basically 
is directly ready for use. According to a preferred embodiment of the method according 
to the invention the box is injection molded in a position 
between its completely folded-out position and its completely collapsed 
position. Injection
