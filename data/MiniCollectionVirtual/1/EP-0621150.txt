<ABSTRACT>
A door beam for use in a car door is obtained 
by extrusion in light metal and having has spaced first 

and second walls (2,3) which in a door are respectively 
facing inwardly and outwardly, and side walls 

connecting the first and second walls to form a box 
shape in cross-section. The door beam further having 

at least one reinforcing element (6,7) inside the box 
shape. The or each reinforcing element (6,7) is a 

connecting member joined at its ends respectively to 
the first and second walls (2,3) and extending across 

the box shape obliquely to the first and second walls 
(2,3). This beam is strong and resistant to sudden 

collapse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a door beam for use in 
a door of a car as a crash bar. The door beam is 
obtained by extrusion of a light metal and comprises 
two walls which respectively face inwardly and 
outwardly in the car door and two side walls connecting 
them together to form a box shape in cross-section. Such a door beam as well as its use is 
described in the journal ALUMINIUM 65 (1989), no. 9, 
pages 4-7 and in EP-A-235091 and EP-A-0284566. 
Suitable extrudable light metal alloys, such as 
aluminium alloys, are well known. Door beams for use in cars in the form of a 
steel tube have been known for some time. These door 
beams serve for installation in the door or doors of a 
car for protection in the event of side collisions. A 
problem with the known steel door beam is that it is 
rather heavy. To this end an alternative is being 
sought in light metal. A light metal section 
manufactured by extrusion is sought with which a stable 
deformation may be obtained under loading. The risk 
with an inadequately stable deformation of the door 
beam is that the resistance capacity may reduce 
abruptly so that a dangerous situation arises for the  
 
occupants of the car on account of the sudden 
elimination of protection. With the known door beam of the kind just 
described made in light metal such a situation can 
arise because of collapse of the side walls which 
connect the walls of the door beam together. This is 
manifested in an uncontrolled and unstable manner of 
collapse of the door beam. In accordance with EP-A-235091 this problem of 
unstable collapse is countered by using thickenings at 
the extremities of the walls of the door beam. It is 
also shown in EP-A-235091 and DE-A-3621697 to insert a 
reinforcing element into the box shape, touching the 
inner and outer walls. For example a tube is 
illustrated in EP-A-235091. 
A door beam according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from 
WO-A-9304886. The object of the present invention is now 
further to counter the problem of unstable collapse as 
described above and to create a door beam which is 
simple in manufacture and light in weight. The door beam in accordance with the invention 
is according to the definition of claim 1.  
 With the door beam in  
 
accordance with the invention the 
angle which each connecting member forms with each of 
the first and second walls is at least 35° and at most 
70°. In a most preferred form of the invention this 
angle is set at approximately 50°. This solution 
provides a good compromise between on the

reinforcing element (6,7) is a connecting member (6,7) 
joined at its ends respectively to said first and 

second walls (2,3) and extending across said box shape 
obliquely to said first and second walls (2,3), 

characterised in that the or each said connecting member 
(6,7) is at an angle in the range 35 to 70° to each 

of said first and second walls (2,3).
