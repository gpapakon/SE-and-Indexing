<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the production of sorbents based on cellulose fibres, comminuted wood material and clay minerals for absorbing liquids. The sorbent is characterised in that   (a) a finely divided cellulosic material having a mean fibre length of 0.4 to 3 mm and a residual moisture content of 5-15% by weight and/or (b) a comminuted wood material having a mean fibre length of 0.05 to 2.0 mm and a residual moisture content of 10 to 20% by weight; and (c) a smectitic clay mineral in finely divided form having a mean particle size of 0.1 to 1.0 mm, a residual moisture content of 5 to 15% by weight and a smectite content of at least 50% by weight are homogeneously mixed   (d) the mixture is compressed and   (e) the compressed mixture is comminuted.   The invention further relates to a sorbent obtainable by this process.

A method of preparing sorbents based on cellulose
fibres, comminuted wood material and clay minerals for the

absorption of liquids, characterised in that

a) a finely divided, cellulose-containing material with an
average fibre length of 0.4 to 3.0 mm and a residual

moisture content of 5 to 15 % by weight and/or
b) a comminuted wood material with an average fibre length
of 0.05 to 2.0 mm and a residual moisture content of 10 to

20 % by weight, and
c) a smectitic clay mineral in finely divided form with an
average particle size of 0.1 to 1.0 mm, a residual moisture

content of 5 to 15 % by weight and smectite content of at
least 50 % by weight are homogeneously mixed,
d) the mixture is compacted and
d) the compacted mixture is comminuted.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the finely divided cellulose-containing material is a

finely ground cellulose or a cellulose material containing
secondary fibres, and finely ground wood flour and/or

comminuted wood shavings is/are used as the comminuted wood
material.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the mixture in stage (d) is compacted, briquetted or

press-granulated.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in
that a pressing force of 20 to 200 kN/cm, preferably 40 to

100 kN/cm, is used.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the starting mixture is directed

between pressing rolls, such as briquetting rolls or press-granulating
rolls. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the starting mixture is compacted,

briquetted or press-granulated with a water content of 10 to
19 % by weight.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that a Ca and/or Na smectite with a water-absorption

capacity (in relation to the dried smectite with
a residual moisture content of 6 % by weight) of at least

approximately 100 %, preferably 120 to 350 %, in particular
120 to 300 %, and a smectite content of 60 to 80 % by weight

is used as starting material.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that a cellulose-fibre containing material

having an average fibre length of 0.4 to 3.0 mm and a water
content of 5 to 15 % by weight, and/or a finely ground wood

flour and/or a material containing comminuted wood pulp with
an average particle size of 0.1 to 2.0 mm and a water

content of 10 to 15 % by weight, is used.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the weight ratios between finely

divided cellulose-containing material and/or comminuted wood
material, on the one hand, and smectitic clay mineral, on

the other hand, are adjusted to 0.5:9.5 to 6.5:3.5, in
particular to 1:9 to 5:5.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the mixture is adjusted to a grain

size of approximately 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably 1 to 5 mm, in
particular with a proportion of 20 to 35 % by weight of the

fraction 1 to 2 mm and a proportion of 80 to 65 % by weight
of the fraction 2 to 5 mm, and the fines produced during

comminution are sieved and returned to the mixing apparatus.
A sorbent which can be obtained according to the
method of Claims 1 to 10 and which is characterised by a 

residual moisture content of approximately 6 to 19 %,
preferably approximately 10 to 15 % by weight and a water-absorption

capacity of more than 100 %, preferably of more
than 120 % (in relation to the mixture dried to a residual
