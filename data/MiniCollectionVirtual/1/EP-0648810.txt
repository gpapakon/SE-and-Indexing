parts by weight of at least one modified polyphenylene ether selected 

from the group consisting of (A1) a modified polyphenylene ether

in which R₁ and R₂ are, independently from each other, a hydrogen 
atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and having 

a number average polymerization degree of 20 to 1200, in which 
0.02/X to 1/X of methyl groups at the 2- and/or 6-positions of phenylene 

group are modified to an aminomethyl group in which X is a 
number average polymerization degree and (A2) a modified 

polyphenylene ether comprising polyphenylene ether to which an 
amino group-containing monomer is graft polymerized, and (B) 0.1 to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel thermoplastic 
resin composition which is used in the production of a molded article 
by injection molding and extrusion molding. Polyphenylene ether has excellent properties such as heat 
resistance, hot water resistance, dimensional stability, and mechanical 
and electrical properties, while it has some drawbacks such as 
poor moldability due to high melt viscosity, low chemical resistance 
and low heat impact resistance. As a technique for improving molding processability of 
polyphenylene ether, it is known to compound polystyrene in polyphenylene 
ether. However, heat resistance of polyphenylene ether is 
considerably deteriorated, while the molding processability is improved. JP-A-57-108153(1982) 
discloses compounding of a copolymer of an olefin with diglycidyl 
methacrylate and/or diglycidyl acrylate to polyphenylene ether 
provides a composition having excellent impact resistance. But, 
molding processability and heat resistance of this composition are 
still unsatisfactory. An object of the present invention is to provide a thermoplastic 
resin composition which is cheap and has improved molding 
processability and impact resistance while making use of good  
 
properties of polyphenylene ether such as mechanical properties, 
heat resistance and the like. This object has been achieved by a 
thermoplastic resin composition comprising 
(A) 100 parts by weight of at least one modified polyphenylene 
ether selected from 
(A1) a modified polyphenylene ether comprising repeating 
units of the formula (1): 
 
wherein R₁ and R₂ are, independently from each other, a hydrogen 
atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and having 
a number average polymerization degree of 20 to 1200, in which 
0.02/X to 1/X of methyl groups at the 2- and/or 6-positions of phenylene 
group are modified to an aminomethyl group wherein X is a 
number average polymerization degree and (A2) a modified polyphenylene ether comprising polyphenylene 
ether to which an amino group-containing monomer is 
graft polymerized,  
and (B) 0.1 to 70 parts by weight of an epoxy group-containing 
ethylene copolymer comprising (a) 50 to 99 % by weight 
of ethylene units, (b) 0.1 to 30 % by weight of unsaturated carboxylic 
acid diglycidyl ester units or unsaturated glycidyl ether units and (c) 
0 to 50 % by weight of ethylenically unsaturated ester compound 
units. Fig. 1 is a two-dimensional HMQC NMR spectrum of the 
polyphenylene ether (R-1). Fig. 2 is a two-dimensional HMQC NMR
