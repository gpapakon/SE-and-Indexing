<ABSTRACT>
Frequency reuse (70) and data coding methods (80, 90) for use in a high data 
rate satellite communication system (10). The frequency reuse method (70) provides 

for dual polarization and spatial reuse of transmit and receive beams to provide for a 
twelve-fold increase in the effective bandwidth and number of users that may be 

supported by the system (10). Transmit and receive antennas provides multiple, inter-leaved 
transmit and receive antenna beams. Digital input data at a source user terminal 

is coded and transmitted from a source user terminal on one of the plurality of receive 
antennas is demodulated. The received data is demodulated demodulated and is routed 

so that it may be transmitted to a destination user terminal. The data is then remodulated, 
multiplexed, and transmitted to the destination user terminal on one of the plurality 

of transmit beams. The transmitted data is decoded at the destination user terminal to 
produce the output data. The input and output data processed by the system is digital, 

and the coding (concatenated coding forward error correction processing) is employed 
to reduce the sensitivity of communicated data to interference. The presently preferred 

encoding method comprises Reed-Solomon encoding (42) input data, interleaving (43) 
the encoded data, and convolutionally encoding (44) the interleaved data and then time 

division multiplexing (45) and modulating (46) the data. The presently preferred 
decoding method comprises demodulating (56) and demultiplexing (57) received time 

division multiplexed data, Viterbi decoding (58) the demultiplexed data, deinterleaving 
(59) the Viterbi decoded data, and Reed-Solomon decoding (60) the deinterleaved data 

to produce the output data. Other multiplexing schemes may alternatively be employed. 
The demodulating and remodulating steps regenerates a high quality digital data stream 

on the satellite that is communicated to the destination terminal to reduce the effects of 
uplink interference upon the downlink data stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to satellite communication systems, and
more particularly, to a frequency reuse scheme and data coding structure for use with a
high data rate satellite communication system that provides data, voice and video
communication between individuals.Prior art communications systems are known from
IEEE international Conference on Communications 1993, 23-26
May 1993, Geneva, CH; pages 1480-1486, 8. Maruyama et al.: "On-board
Processor for Millimeter-Wave Personal satellite Communications
System";US-A-4 689 625; andEP-A-0 535 812.The past several decades has seen the development of communications systems
that have provided for the real-time distribution of information on a global scale. The
development of these global communication systems has evolved along several paths
that use either ground-based or satellite-based communication. Satellite-based systems
have been employed for many years to distribute voice, data and video signals for
global broadcasting of news and sporting events, for example. With the advent of
newer high power satellite systems and technology, direct broadcast television systems
are available that provide for broadcasting of television signals from up to 100 stations
using a single satellite. Individuals install an antenna and a satellite receiver to receive
the broadcasts directly by way of the satellite and display them on a television monitor.To provide for more personal communication or teleconferencing between
individuals, companies such as AT&T, for example, have developed a video telephone
system that employs a small (3-4 inch) television monitor in combination with a
conventional telephone. The video telephone system typically uses fiber optic links to
provide a sufficient bandwidth to carry the video and voice signals. However, this type
of system does not have enough bandwidth to provide for full motion video. In order to provide for an even more cost-effective solution to personal
telecommunication needs, the assignee of the present has developed a high data rate
satellite communication system that provides for the communication and distribution of
full motion video, voice and data signals, to provide for personal teleconferencing
between individuals. This system is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.

System", assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
