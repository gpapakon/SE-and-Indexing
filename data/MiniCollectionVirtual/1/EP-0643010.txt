<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport apparatus for displacing loading units on a smooth base without loading aids, in particular for elevating trucks of retrievers, in which transport apparatus a loading unit can be taken over from a conveyor by means of a gripping/pulling device and moved to its storage position or vice versa. So that loading units of different size or different shape can be put into their storage position and removed from their storage position with an apparatus of this type without the need for special loading aids, it is proposed according to the invention that a parallel horizontal conveyor (3) be allocated to at least one storage side (5a) having several storage positions (4) lying side by side and/or one above the other, and that at least one pair of sliding arms (7a; 7b) be mounted in a plane, in each case running perpendicularly to the conveying transport direction (8) of a loading unit (1), on a movable telescopic base frame (9), and that the sliding-arm pairs (7a; 7b) can be swung into or out of a horizontal position in opposite directions in front of and/or behind the loading unit (1).
