<ABSTRACT>
Motor vehicle gearbox comprising an input shaft (2), two intermediate shafts (3, 4) and an output shaft (5). A co-rotating, pretensioned gear wheel (30) is arranged on the one intermediate shaft (4). This gear wheel transmits a take-up force via a gear wheel (10) on the output shaft to the second intermediate shaft (3) and from there to the output shaft (5) and back to the first-mentioned intermediate shaft (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle gearbox 
comprising 
the features as defined in the preamble 
of claim 1 which are well-known for the person skilled in the art. 
In most cars with manual gearboxes, mechanical chatter is 
present during idling and driving at low engine revolutions. 
The noise arises as the teeth of the gear wheels impact each 
other at a certain frequency when an acceleration is imparted 
to the gear wheels in the gearbox due to uneven running of the 
motor at low revs. This unevenness is transmitted via the 
clutch and input shaft and is dependent on the engine as well 
as lag in the gearbox. The engine's flywheel has larger angular 
acceleration and amplitude of oscillation at low revs, so that 
the idling noise in most cases increases with reduced revs. A 
low idling speed is however generally desirable since it 
results in better fuel economy. Several different methods for damping or totally eliminating 
idling chatter in gearboxes are known. For example, clutches 
with particular rigidity and damping can be used, the moment of 
inertia of the flywheel can be increased or the tooth clearance 
reduced. In addition, friction brakes can be used in the 
gearbox, though these tend to adversely affect the gear change 
quality. In most cases these measures are insufficient to 
dampen the chatter or are expensive since they require 
relatively comprehensive modification to existing components. 
As regards reduction of the tooth clearance, from a functional  
 
and production/technical aspect it is impossible to obtain such 
a small clearance that effective damping is achieved. Several of the above-mentioned disadvantages are eliminated by 
means of an arrangement in which one gear wheel of a pair of 
meshing gear wheels has a hub portion on which a gear wheel in 
the form of a thin disc with the same tooth pattern as the 
actual gear wheel is rotatably carried. Resilient elements are 
located between the gear wheel and the disc and are 
pretensioned in the gear wheel's engagement position. Such an 
arrangement entails low production costs and high efficiency 
and, thanks to its damping properties, is uninfluenced by the 
natural frequency of the transmission components. This arrangement does however have certain limits. On the one 
hand, the tooth clearance is eliminated only between the gear 
wheel pair which has a gear wheel with a pretensioned disc and, 
on the other hand, due to production techniques, such a gear 
disc cannot be positioned on the side of the gear wheel

Motor vehicle gearbox comprising: 

an input shaft (2) carrying gear wheels (7 - 9), 
two intermediate shafts (3 and 4) carrying gear 
wheels (20, 21 and 17) meshing with gear wheels of said 

input shaft to provide cooperating pairs of gear wheels 
(20/8, 21/9 and 17/7) 
at least one gear wheel of each cooperating pair of 
gear wheels being releasable from its shaft so that 

only one of the two intermediate shafts (3 and 4) is 
drivable at a time, and 
an output shaft (5) carrying a gear wheel (15) engaging 
a fixed gear wheel (13, 14) provided on each of said 

intermediate shafts, 
characterized in that
a releasable gear wheel (10) is provided on the input 
shaft and meshes with two equal-sized gear wheels (16, 

30), each of which is non-releasably arranged on its 
respective intermediate shaft, and 
at least one of said non-releasable gear wheels comprises 
a hub portion (31) and a gear ring (32), with 

the hub portion being fixed to the intermediate 
shaft whilst the gear ring is restrictively rotatable 

with respect to the hub portion, and pretensioned 
spring means (33) are operative between the gear ring 

and the hub portion. 
Motor vehicle gearbox according to claim 1, wherein 
said at least one non-releasable gear wheel (30) is a 

co-rotating gear wheel having no torque transmitting 
function, whilst said other non-releasable gear wheel 

(16) is arranged to transmit torque to its associated 
intermediate shaft (3).  

 
Motor vehicle gearbox according to claim 1 or 2 having five 
forward gears and one reverse gear, whereby torque in the first, 

second and third forward gear is transmitted via the one intermediate 
shaft, and whereby torque in the fifth and reverse gear 

is transmitted via the other intermediate shaft on which said at 
least one non-releasable gear wheel (30) is provided. 
Motor vehicle gearbox according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein said gear ring (32) comprises in its inner circumferential 

surface at least one recess (34) into which projects a radially 
outwardly directed dog (35) of the hub portion (31), and 

wherein a spring member (33) is accommodated between an end surface 
of the recess and a surface of the dog. 
Motor vehicle gearbox according to claim 4, wherein an opening 
(39) is provided in one side wall (38) of said gear ring (32) and 

opens to said recess (34) through which opening said dog (35) is 
axially inserted during assembly of said at least one non-releasable 

gear wheel. 
Motor vehicle gearbox according to claim 4 or 5, wherein said 
gear ring (32) comprises in its inner circumferential surface a 

plurality of uniformally spaced recesses (34) into each of which 
projects a respective radially outwardly directed dog (35) provided 

on the hub portion (31). 
Motor vehicle gearbox according to claim 3, wherein said input 
shaft comprises a clutch means (11) which has a first engage position 

to lock said releasable gear wheel (10) to said input 
shaft, a second engage position to lock the output shaft (5) to 

the input shaft providing the fourth forward gear and an intermediate 
neutral position to release said releasable gear wheel 

(10) and the output shaft from the input shaft.
