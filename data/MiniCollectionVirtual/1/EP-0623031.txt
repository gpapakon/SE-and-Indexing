<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an implant made of a porous non-toxic material having a total open porosity exceeding 5 % by volume but not exceeding 80 % by volume within at least one portion of the implant, which is characterized in that: communicating micropores, having a size of less than or equal to 10  mu m, make up not more than 10 % of the total pore volume in said at least one portion of the implant; and at least 5 % of at least one section of the surface on the implant is covered by substantially evenly distributed pores having a pore size exceeding 50  mu m.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of medical technology
and more specifically to the field of implantology,
and relates to implants made of a porous, non-toxic material
having a total open porosity exceeding 5 % by volume but not
exceeding 80 % by volume within at least a portion of the implant, 
wherein it has communicating micropores having a size of not larger than 10 µm, said
communicating micropores making up not more than 10 % of the total pore volume in said at
least one portion of the implant; at least 5 % of at least one section of the surface of the
implant is covered by substantially evenly distributed pores having a pore size exceeding 50
µm; and the implant contains bone ingrowth-promoting agents added to the implant through
carriers, which completely or partially fill the micropores as well as the pores in the surface
layer of the implant. When implant materials are used and are subjected to a substantial
mechanical load, a high strength is the primary requirement.
This is achieved by using essentially conventional
construction materials - e.g. stainless steel, cobalt-chromium
alloys, titanium and titanium-alloys, various
ceramic materials and polymers. In order to fix implants, it
is common practice to utilize a topographical surface or
pores. In this connection special requirements as to holding
and bone ingrowth must be met. WO 92/21302, published 22 July 1993,
relates to an implant made of a porous non-toxic material with
a total open porosity larger than 5 percent by volume but not larger than 80 percent by volume
within at least a portion of the implant. The implant is characterized in that: communicating
pores with a pore size within the interval of 0.1-10 µm occupy 10-80 percent of the total
pore volume in said at least one portion of the implant; pores with a pore size within the
interval of 10-50 µm occupy not more than 5 % of the total pore volume in said at least one
portion of the implant; and 5-40 % of at least one portion of the surface of the implant is
covered by mainly evenly distributed pores having a pore size within the interval of 50-500 µm.This specific and complex pore size distribution can be utilised to accommodate bone in
growth-promoting agents and to provide a satisfactory bone ingrowth in large pores. The object of the present invention is to provide an improve
implant as compared to the implant according to said
WO 92/21302. The present invention
relates more specifically to substantially limiting
the porosity of micropores by adding bone
