<ABSTRACT>
A first level carriage lockout scheme employs one set of 
cartridge tabs (14, 20, 24, 28) to differentiate print cartridges (17, 

18, 22, 26) from each other for a first family of print cartridges, 
and another first level carriage lockout scheme employs another set 

of cartridge tabs (32,34; 38,40; 44,46; 50,52; 56,58; 62,64) to 
differentiate print cartridges (30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60) from each 

other for a second family of print cartridges. A second level 
carriage lockout employs cartridge wings (70, 72) to differentiate 

between different families of print cartridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to print cartridges which are 
removably mounted in a printer carriage, and more specifically 
to a lockout apparatus for removable pen cartridges according 
to the preamble of claim 1, for preventing a user from 
mounting the wrong print cartridge in a printer carriage. The 
terms "pen" and "print cartridge" are used synonymously and 
interchangeably herein. WO-A-8908028 discloses a scheme for preventing the incorrect 
insertion of a pen cartridge wherein first and second pen 
types each have a respective predetermined number of tab 
members projecting in a common direction, and wherein an 
entrance barrier is provided in the pen compartment preventing 
initial insertion of a pen cartridge of the first type but not 
interfering with the insertion of a pen cartridge of the 
second type. In the past, the typical way of indicating to the user the 
type and color of a print cartridge to be used in printers such as 
inkjet printers having removable print cartridges was to color code  
 
this information on the outside of the print cartridge housing. 
This approach had the disadvantage of providing no positive 
feedback to the user, and furthermore it would not prevent improper 
use for those print cartridges and printer carriages which were 
otherwise configured for proper mating of the print cartridge into 
the printer carriage. This use of print cartridges in printer 
carriages for which they were not intended can result in 
undesirable print quality and possible damage to both the print 
cartridge and the printer in which it is used. The general purpose and principal object of the present 
invention is to provide a new and improved method for preventing 
insertion of a print cartridge into a printer carriage compartment 
for which it was not intended, and further having mechanical and 
visual feedback to the end user that absolutely prevents the wrong 
inkjet pen or print cartridge from being inserted into the wrong 
printer carriage or wrong carriage compartment. Another object of this invention is to provide a new and 
improved method of the type described wherein all configuration 
features on the print cartridge used for lockout purposes may be 
removed to produce a universal pen for all inkjet printers. 
Accordingly, the present invention provides a lockout 
apparatus comprising the features of claim 1. One implementation of this invention provides a print carriage 
adapted for holding multiple pen cartridges, wherein each carriage 
compartment includes one or more
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Lockout apparatus for removable pen cartridges mounted in individual 
compartments of respective printer carriages, comprising first and second pen 

types each having a respective predetermined number of tab members 
projecting in a same first direction; and an entrance barrier located in a first 

surface (148) of selected said compartments for cooperating with said tab members 
to provide a first lockout means preventing initial insertion of a pen cartridge of 

said first pen type but not interfering with complete insertion of a pen cartridge 
of said second pen type, 

characterized in that 

the first pen type (Family II) includes all the tab 
members (14, 20 or 24) of the second pen type (Family I); 
the second pen type has a projecting wing member (70) projecting in a direction 
perpendicular to said first direction; 
the projecting wing member is not present in the first pen type; 
a second barrier (68) is located on a second surface (66) of selected said 
compartments perpendicular to said first surface, said second barrier 

cooperating with said projecting wing member to provide a second 
lockout means preventing complete insertion of said second pen type 

but not interfering with complete insertion of a pen cartridge of said first 
pen type,
 
thereby providing an ID scheme for selectively allowing either a first type or a 

second type of pen cartridge to be completely inserted into a respective said 
compartment. 
The lockout apparatus of claim 1 further characterized in that said entrance 
barrier includes one or more slots, and wherein said tab member is a 

key-coded tab member sized and spaced to match said slots. 
The lockout apparatus of claim 1 or 2 characterized in that said second 
barrier may assume one of at least two different barrier floor configurations at 

the bottom of the individual compartments.  
 
The lockout apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3 characterized in that 

the entrance barrier and the projecting tab members are visible during the 
insertion of the pen cartridge into its respective compartment, and 
the second barrier and the wing member are not visible during the insertion of 
the pen cartridge into its respective compartment,
 
whereby the first lockout means may be used to assist the user in determining 

which pen goes into which compartment, and the second lockout means may 
be used to prevent the inadvertent insertion of a type of pen that was intended 

to a different type of printer.
