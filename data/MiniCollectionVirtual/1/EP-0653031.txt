<ABSTRACT>
A sliding ring packing between two parts, in particular a packing on the inlet part of a drum filter comprising a stationary packing ring (2) fixed to one of the parts and, pressed onto it, a moving ring (1) coupled with the other of the two parts. To the moving ring (1) is fixed one end of a resilient ring membrane (4) whose the other end is fixed between a guiding ring (8) and a supporting ring (6) between which is seated an overlapping resilient packing (9) providing for the pressure of the guiding ring (8) on the supporting ring (6).

 DescriptionSliding Ring PackingTechnical FieldThe invention relates to a sliding ring packing between two parts, in particular to a packing on the inlet part of a drum filter comprising a stationary packin ring fixed to one of the parts and, pressed onto it, a moving ring coupled with the other of the two parts on which is fixed a su porting ring.Background of the InventionSliding ring packings of large-diameter rotary surfaces are used for instance in drum filters serving for cleaning soiled waste water. In known drum filters, the soiled waste water is led into the inner space of the rotary drum filter whose lower part is in the filtered water, the level of the soiled waste water inside the drum of the drum filter being higher than the level of the filtered water outside the drum of the drum filter. The packing on the inlet part of the drum filter serves to prevent the unfiltered water outside the drum of the drum filter from getting into the space between the stationary and the rotary parts of the drum of the drum filter due to the hydrostatic pressure produced by the level difference inside and outside the drum of the drum filter. A typical feature of these sliding ring packings consists in the large diameter of the packed surface and in the risk of unwanted radial and axial movements of the rotary part of the drum filter due to inaccurate seating.The heretofore known packing of the drum filter consists of a hose filled with water under adjustable 

pressure and seated between the stationary and the rotary part of the drum filter. The hose spreading provides for eliminating the gap between the stationary and the rotary parts of the drum filter. Even if the rubber hose can be replaced by a hose made of another elastic material, this packing is marked by low service life, unreliable working, increased need both to check its function and to carry out its maintenance. At the same time, this type of packing features high resistance against the rotation of the drum filter.Another known sliding ring packing, described in US 4,854.598, is used in pumps for liquids. The packing comprises a ring made of a hard material and fixed in the moving wheel of the pump. Onto this ring made of a hard material is pressed a sliding ring made of a graphite-saturated resin by means of an axially acting spring. This packing is intended for small diameter packings and high rotation speeds.The use of this design for drum filter packings is impossible, because the sliding ring would get worn-out in a very short time, and the

PATENT CLAIMS
1. A sliding ring packing between two parts, in particular a packing on the inlet part of a drum filter comprising a stationary packing ring fixed to one of the parts and, pressed onto it, a moving ring coupled with the other of the two parts, characterized by that to the moving ring (1) there is fixed one end of a resilient ring membrane (4) whose the other end is fixed between a guiding ring (8) and a supporting ring (6) between which is seated an overlapping resilient packing providing for the pressure of the guiding ring (8) on the supporting ring (6).
2.A sliding ring packing as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by that the other end of the resilient ring membrane (4) is put on the guiding ring (8) by means of which the resilient ring membrane (4) is fixed to the supporting ring (6), said end of the resilient ring membrane (4) being pressed by the resiÂ¬ lient packing member (9) to the guiding ring (8).
3. A sliding ring packing as claimed in Claim
1, characterized by that on the supporting ring (6) there is seated a torsion spring (11) whose free end leans against the guiding ring (8).
