A process for regenerating foundry sand in an upright dry grinding machine having at 
least one horizontally rotating grinding tool (14) and compressed air supply device, 

characterised in that only outside the rotary circle of the blades of the grinding tool is 
air blown in or drawn in through the floor and/or the side wall into the outer region of 

the sand charge in the grinding machine, which in cooperation with the rotating blades 
produces a layer (18) of fluidised sand flowing upwardly in the peripheral region, in 

that the dust-charged air (22) is drawn off above the charging level and the denser 
sand, which is then no longer fluidised, is conveyed in the central flow (19) 

downwardly to the grinding tool (14) rotating just above the floor. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the air is blown or drawn into 
the sand charge at locations (7,8;31) disposed horizontally close to the walls and floor 

and spaced from one another. 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the peripherally upwardly 
(18) and the centrally downwardly (19) directed streams of sand are conveyed 

separately from one another by a partition (34) open at the top and bottom and 
disposed above the grinding tool (14). 
A process according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the rotational speed of the 
grinding tool (14) and/or pressure, quantity, blowing-in location and blowing-in 

direction of the air alter in the course of the regenerating treatment and are adapted to 
the cleaning progress of the grains of sand and dust discharge. 
A process according to Claim 4, characterised in that the cleaning progress is 
monitored by means of the current or power consumption of the driving motor (12) 

and the change therein is used as a signal to control further operating parameters in the 
charging operation. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the air is 
blown in or drawn in through locations (8) disposed at various wall heights. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the dust-charged 
exhaust air is conveyed through a funnel-shaped sand trap (20) in the grinding 

machine to a discharge line (23). 
A process according to one or more of the preceding Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the removal of the dust-charged exhaust air is assisted and/or controlled by means 

of suction through the discharge line (23) and/or injection of transverse air beneath the 
sand trap. 
A process according to one or more of the preceding Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the unburnt valuable substances strongly accumulated in the exhaust air (22)  

 
particularly in the initial period of the regenerating treatment are collected separately 

for reutilisation. 
A process according to Claim 9, characterised in that the grinding rotor (14) is not 
driven or is only driven slowly in a pr
ecleaning phase. 
A device for regenerating foundry sand, consisting of an upright dry grinding machine 
having closable sand supply (16) and discharge opening (24), compressed air and/or 

suction air supply (5,5a,6) and exhaust air discharge line (23), and also at least one 
horizontally rotating grinding tool (14), characterised in that the inlet lines (7,8) for the 

fluidisation air are disposed outside the rotary circle of the blades of the grinding rotor 
(14) rotating just above the base plate (9). 
A device according to Claim 11, characterised in that the grinding rotor (14) has at 
least two curved blades, which are driven by a speed-controllable motor (12). 
A device according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised in that the inlet lines (7) are 
disposed in the corner region formed by base plate (9) and container wall (1). 
A device according to Claim 13, characterised in that the inlet lines (7) consist of at 
least two groups of segment-shaped individual chambers (26,27). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding Claims 11 to 14, characterised in 
that the container wall (1) is surrounded by one or more air chambers (3,3a,4), which 

have supply lines (5,5a,6) controllable independently of one another. 
A device according to one or more of Claims 11 to 15, characterised in that the inlet 
lines are constructed as self-cleaning annular gaps (7,31) having annular gap segments 

or air passages (8) disposed spaced from one another. 
A device according to Claim 16, characterised in that the inlet lines have sand-tight 
inserts of porous sintered metal or sand filters. 
A device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 17, characterised by at least one 
tubular partition (34) disposed in the charging chamber of the grinding machine above 

the grinding rotor (14) and beneath the charging level (17). 
A device according to one or more of Claims 11 to 18, characterised by a funnel-shaped 
sand trap (20) disposed between charging pipe (16) and charging level (17). 
A device according to Claim 19, characterised in that injection nozzles for transverse 
air are provided in the container wall (1) between the under side of the sand trap (20) 

and the charging level (17). 
Use of a device according to one or more of Claims 11 to 19 to round off the new 
sand by rough grinding.
