<ABSTRACT>
A femoral implant (1) for a hip prosthesis includes a shaft (3) 
oriented in a longitudinal direction and a neck (5) extending 

from said shaft (3) at an acute angle ϑ to the longitudinal 
direction. The implant (1) includes a plurality of layers of 

fibers in a matrix, wherein the fibers are substantially 
unidirectional in each respective layer. The implant (1) is 

made from a stack of layers of the matrix so that the 
direction of fibers is unbalanced. At least as much of 

the fibers are oriented in the ϑ direction as are fibers 
oriented in any direction other than the ϑ direction, the 

number of fibers oriented in the ϑ direction being 
different from the number of fibers oriented in the shaft 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a femoral implant 
used as a hip-joint prosthesis. In particular, the 
invention relates to implants made of composite laminates of 
continuous fiber in a matrix. For example, the fibers may 
be carbon, boron, ceramic, metal, aramid fibers (e.g. 
Kevlar), or fiberglass, and the matrix may be biocompatible 
and polymer, metal, ceramic, or carbon. A femoral implant, as the name implies, replaces the 
end of a femur in a hip-joint prosthetic device. The 
femoral implant basically includes a longitudinal stem or 
shaft that is connected to bone. In present practice, the 
stem sits in a cavity formed in the proximal region of the 
femur. A neck extends from the shaft terminating in a ball, 
which cooperates with the acetabulum, or socket, of the hip 
joint in the pelvis. To insert the implant, the head of the 
femur is removed and a cavity formed in the bone just below 
the cut. The shaft of the implant is then anchored into the 
cavity using, e.g., a press-fit or bone cement. Implants made of fiber embedded in a polymeric matrix 
have been used in place of earlier metal implant designs. 
Fiber-matrix composite implants can be engineered to exhibit 
structural properties more closely resembling that of 
natural bone, which has less of an adverse effect than 
implants much stiffer than natural bone.  One method of making an implant of continuous 
unidirectional fiber involved stacking layers having 
parallel unidirectional continuous orientation of the 
fibers; in a matrix, in which the fiber in each layer was 
arranged in a parallel manner. The orientation of the fiber 
in the final implant could then be varied by stacking the 
individual layers in such a way that the fibers were aligned 
in the desired direction. The final product was produced by 
heating the matrix in which the fibers were embedded in 
order to cause the matrix to flow. Upon cooling, the matrix 
hardened into a composite block in which the various layers 
of fiber were aligned as desired. Fibers were aligned in these composite blocks in 
directions wherein increased strength was considered to 
provide optimum results. For example, reinforcement was 
provided along the shaft, i.e., the longitudinal axis, by 
orienting a majority of the fibers in that direction. 
Reinforcement was also provided by orienting fibers at an 
acute angle to the longitudinal direction, balanced by 
fibers oriented in the negative acute angle direction, 
producing a mirror image about the a sagittal plane of the 
device. However, it
