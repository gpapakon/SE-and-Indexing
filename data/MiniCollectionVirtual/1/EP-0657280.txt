<ABSTRACT>
The invention generally relates to a method of manufacturing a polycarbonate-based panel (sheet) intended for the construction of buildings, especially glasshouses (conservatories, greenhouses), and comprising a core layer and at least one covering layer. According to the invention, the method consists in making up a composition for the said covering layer by incorporating shiny metallic particles, of a mean diameter ranging from approximately 200 to approximately 500  mu m, into polycarbonate and coextruding the said polycarbonate covering layer, in order partially to decrease the light transmission of the panel and so as to reduce the greenhouse effect. The invention applies to the building field.

Process for manufacturing a polycarbonate-based panel
intended for the construction of buildings, particularly of

greenhouses, and comprising a core layer and at least one
coating layer, the said process being characterised in that

it consists:

in preparing a composition for the said coating layer
while incorpor
ating 10 to 30 per cent by weight of shiny
metal particles having an average diameter ranging from 200

to 500 µm, in polycarbonate, and
in co-extruding the said coating layer made of
polycarbonate with the said core layer made of

polycarbonate, in order to partially lower the light
transmission of the panel and in such a way as to reduce

the greenhouse effect.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
metal particles are particles of aluminium, silver, bronze,

copper or any other metal having shiny properties.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that the
metal particles are preferably aluminium particles.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the coating layer containing the said

metal particles has a thickness of 20 to 200 µm, and
preferably of 50 to 150 µm.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the composition for the said coating 

layer also comprises an ultraviolet-radiation-absorbing
agent.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that it consists:


in also preparing a composition for an external coating
layer while incorporating an ultraviolet-radiation-absorbing

agent in polycarbonate,
in preparing a composition for an intermediate coating
layer while incorporating 10 to 30 per cent by weight of

metal particles having an average diameter ranging from 200
to 500 µm, in polycarbonate, and
in co-extruding the said external and intermediate
coating layers with the core layers.
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that an
ultraviolet-radiation-absorbing agent is also incorporated

in the composition of the intermediate coating layer.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that it consists:


in preparing a composition for an external coating layer
while incorporating an ultraviolet-radiation-absorbing

agent and 10 to 30 per cent by weight of metal particles
having an average diameter ranging from 200 to 500 µm, in

polycarbonate;
in preparing a composition for an intermediate coating
layer while incorporating either the aforesaid agent or

another ultraviolet-radiation-absorbing agent, or metal
particles having an average diameter ranging from 200 to

500 µm, in polycarbonate, and 
in co-extruding the said external and intermediate
coating layers with the core layer.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the said panel is cellular.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the said panel is also tinted in the

mass, especially in opaline, smoke or grey.
