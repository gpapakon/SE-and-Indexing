<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to equipment consisting of an upright (4) having at its lower part a fork equipped with two perpendicular rods (2), and, possibly, with two wheels (22) which are intended to form a trolley. A slide (7) sliding on the upright (4) includes, perpendicular to it, a claw holder (5) which is intended, in opposition with the rods (2), to grab hold of the tyre, and a means (9) for immobilization on the upright (4). An extension piece (1) is fixed onto the latter in order to increase the lever arm effect. According to an alternative, by virtue of a hook, it makes it easier to position the wheel relative to the hub of the vehicle. The device according to the invention is particularly intended for breakdown assistance to heavy goods vehicles.
