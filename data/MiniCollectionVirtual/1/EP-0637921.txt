<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of treating an object with a stream of hot air aimed at the object using a hand-held air-jet drier which has a heater and a fan, the heater (4) being controlled in proportion to the distance (S) to the object. In order to carry out the method, the drier (3) is fitted with a distance-measuring device with an output (12) for the distances measured (S1, S2, S3, S4), a comparator (13) being used to derive proportional control signals from the distance measurements (S1, S2, S3, S4) and from a predetermined temperature set using a temperature selector (14), the control signals being used to control the power-control unit (11).
