<ABSTRACT>
By means of the control system, the transmission ratio of the gearbox is adjusted automatically as a function of the position of the accelerator pedal and the speed of the vehicle with reference to stored characteristic diagrams (24). The control system also takes into account here the load state of the vehicle and the driving style of the driver. The said control system has a fuzzy logic system (23) which is provided with a control base (29) and by means of which temporal average values or changes in signals (dK, ay, ddK...) which represent operating states of the vehicle or actuation of the accelerator pedal are evaluated. As a function of this evaluation, a characteristic diagram which is used to control gear changing or to adjust the transmission ratio of the gearbox is selected. Instead of the selection of another characteristic diagram, an existing characteristic diagram can also be changed by moving characteristic curves.

Controller (6) for an automatic motor vehicle 
transmission (5), by means of which the transmission 

ratio of the transmission is automatically set as a 
function of the accelerator pedal position and of the 

vehicle speed with the aid of stored characteristic maps 
(SKF1,..., SKFn), by means of which, furthermore, the 

load condition of the motor vehicle are taken into 
account, and which controller has a fuzzy logic unit (23) 

which is provided with a rule base (29) by means of which 
temporal mean values or signal changes (dk, ay, ddk), 

which reproduce operating conditions of the motor vehicle 
or accelerator pedal actuations, are evaluated and are 

used to select or vary the characteristic map which is to 
be used to control the transmission ratio of the transmission, 

characterized in that by means of the fuzzy rule 
base (29) selection signals (f, 1) are formed which 

typify the driving style of the driver and the load 
condition of the motor vehicle and by means of which the 

characteristic map (SKF) is fixed or varied as a function 
of the respective preceding characteristic map. 
Controller according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by means 

of which the difference between in each case two signals 
(ay), which reproduce the transverse acceleration of the 

motor vehicle at successive time intervals, is formed and 
used to detect the start of cornering. 
Controller according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by means 

of which the frequency of the adjustment of the accelerator 
pedal (ddk) during a prescribed time interval (z) is  

 
determined and used to evaluate the driving style of the 

driver. 
Controller according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by means 

of which the absolute value of the difference (Î”F) 
between the driving and braking forces and the tractive 

resistances of the motor vehicle in the plane is formed 
and is averaged over a prescribed period, and in that the 

type of roadway and the loading of the motor vehicle are 
determined from the mean value obtained. 
Controller according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it has a characteristic map selection circuit in 

which prescribed limiting values (em, me, ms, sm, ax, xa, 
xta) for the selection signals (f, 1) are stored, and in 

that these limiting values are decisive for selecting or 
varying characteristic maps. 
Controller according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the limiting values (em, me, ms, sm, ax, xa, xta) 

are fixed empirically or calculated and provided with a 
hysteresis. 
Controller according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the characteristic map is varied by point-by-point 

displacement of transmission ratio value assignments. 
Controller according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the hysteresis is enlarged by increasing the distance 

between the respective change-up and change-down 
characteristics (1-2, 2-1,...,3-4, 4-3).
