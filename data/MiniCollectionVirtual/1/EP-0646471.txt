<ABSTRACT>
A method of double-sided printing, in effect, 
on opposite or both surfaces of a layer on a multilayered 

foil laminate. Moreover, also disclosed is the 
provision of a novel multi-layered foil laminate (30) having 

at least one layer, preferably an exterior layer (50) which is 
constituted of a plastic film material, and which is 

provided with printing on both surfaces of the layer. In 
essence, the inventive method of double-sided printing 

includes initially printing on a first side of an outer 
layer of a plastic film material, preferably such as 

polyester, wherein the printing is imparted to the side 
or surface (52) of the plastic film material facing towards an 

underlying metallic foil (54) to which it is to be adhered, 
and wherein the printing is applied to the plastic film 

material through the intermediary of reverse halftone 
color printing, whereby subsequent this particular 

printing on the one side of the outer plastic film layer 
having been completed, the plastic film material is 

adhesively fastened at the printed surface thereof to the 
underlying metallic foil, such as through the 

interposition of a suitable adhesive (56). Thereafter, in 
order to effectuate the printing on the opposite or 

external surface of the outer plastic film material, the 
laminated foil has thermal transfer printing imparted to 

the outer surface of the plastic film layer, preferably 
through the intermediary of a ceramic printing head, 

imparting further indicia indicative of specific 
information relative to the contents of a package which 

is to be equipped with the foil laminate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
printed, laminated lidstock, for contact lens blister packages,
comprising a foil laminate and to a method of producing
such lidstock.The utilization of foil laminates which possess an
external surface which is imprinted with various legends
and indicia, and whereby the foil laminate may be utilized,
among numerous other physical applications, as
lid stock for plastic packages, such as the so-called
"blister packages" of the injection molded type, is well-known
in the packaging technology.In many instances, the externally arranged layer of
the lid or cover-forming foil laminate, in essence, the
layer having a surface facing the outside of the package,
may be provided with suitable printing. For example,
such printing may consist of indicia or legends identifying
the manufacturer, the manufacturer's logo and miscellaneous
information and decorative and advertising
indicia identifying the product in the package, and
include suitable variable technical information, such as
expiration dates, lot numbers and other data specific to
the packaged product.Basically, such multi-layered foil laminates in the
form of webs which are employed for lid stock purposes
include outer layers of suitable plastic film material
adhesively fastened to both sides or opposite surfaces
of a foil web. Such a foil web is ordinarily constituted of
suitable metallic material, which may be aluminum or
the like, and wherein one of the plastic film material layers
is adapted to be adhesively secured, such as by
means of heat sealing or the like, to the injection-molded
material of the plastic container or package
whose contents it is adapted to seal therein. Frequently,
blister packages or similar plastic containers which have
covers in the shape of foil laminates applied thereto are
subjected to potentially damaging temperature and/or
environmental conditions. This may be the case when
the entire package is subjected to sterilization, as in the
instance when the product housed therein is intended to
be employed in a medical capacity; for example, a product
such as contact lens which is adapted to be
packed in a sterile saline solution and sealed in a compartment
or cavity of the package.It is essential to be able to ensure that the printing
which is normally provided on the exterior of the package
will safely withstand these above-mentioned conditions
without either being completely obliterated or even
only rendered partially illegible. Consequently, it is an
important aspect that suitable kinds of

<CLAIMS>
Printed, laminated lidstock for contact lens blister packages, comprising:

(a) a metallic foil and
(b) a first layer constituted of a plastic film material that is at least translucent and
that is adhesively secured to one surface of said foil, wherein said first layer has:


on the surface thereof facing said foil, indicia imprinted via conventional lithography; and
on the surface thereof remote from said foil, indicia imprinted by thermal transfer
printing through the intermediary of a ceramic printing head,
whereby said indicia on the two surfaces of said first layer form a printed label.
The lidstock of claim 1, wherein: the indicia on the surface of the first layer facing
said foil are imprinted by lithographic halftone printing and are visible in a desired

orientation upon viewing thereof from the exterior of said lidstock.
The lidstock of claim 2, wherein said first indicia are printed in at least one
colour.
The lidstock of claim 3, wherein an opaque contrasting colour background is
printed on the surface of said first layer facing said foil beneath said imprinted indicia.
The lidstock of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said first layer is adhesively
secured to said foil through the interposition of a dry bond adhesive layer.
The lidstock of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the indicia imprinted on the
surface of said first layer remote from said foil are stable upon being exposed to

temperatures within the range of 120°C to 130°C over periods of about 30 minutes.
The lidstock of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said indicia imprinted on the
surface of said first layer remote from said foil are located in specific orientations over

print fields present on the surface of said first layer facing said foil. 
The lidstock of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein a second plastic film material
layer is adhesively secured to the side of said foil opposite the side having said first layer

secured thereto.
The lidstock of claim 8, wherein said second layer is heat sealable to a blister
package constituted of an injection-moulded plastic material.
A method of producing lidstock as defined in any one of claims 1 to 7 comprising:

(a) imprinting first indicia on a first surface of a first plastic film material that is at

first surface of a metallic foil; and
(c) imprinting second indicia on the surface of said first plastic film material remote
