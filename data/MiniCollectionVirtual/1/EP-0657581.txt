<ABSTRACT>
A pulp moulding (100) which is used to package an 
article, e.g. an egg (102), has a region (110) which does 

not initially contact the article (102) and a region (103) 
which does initially contact the article. Region (103) is 

of a thickness different from that of region (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to pulp mouldings 
and their manufacture. It is known to mould articles from paper pulp and 
the like. For example, egg cartons and other packaging 
items are commonly made in this way. In recent times, there 
has been a move to replace conventional expanded polystyrene 
and other plastics packaging items by corresponding pulp 
products, both to achieve economies and for ecological 
reasons. However, current manufacturing techniques for pulp 
products, whilst perfectly satisfactory for fairly crude 
items such as egg boxes, do not easily permit the production 
of more sophisticated items. In general, pulp products are made by providing a 
mesh mould, feeding an aqueous pulp to one side of the 
mould, and applying a vacuum to the other side of the mould 
to draw water through the mesh, thus leaving the solids 
(fibres) deposited on the mesh. The wet moulded solids are 
then removed and dried to form the moulded product. The 
mesh moulds for these processes are largely hand-made and, 
especially for complex shapes, can take a long time to make. 
In one typical procedure, individual pieces of wire mesh are 
shaped and located on a support member, and joined to 
adjacent pieces to build up a complete mould. It will be appreciated that it is very difficult 
by these conventional procedures to make anything but 
relatively simple moulded products. Furthermore, it is  
 
difficult if not impossible to make very accurately 
dimensioned and shaped products. These limitations of the 
production process result in severe limitations on the sort 
of products which can be made by this technique. We have now found that it is possible to make pulp 
mouldings which are much more sophisticated than hitherto 
and, in particular, mouldings in which the thickness can be 
controlled to provide variations in the moulding. This has 
not been possible in a controlled way in prior known 
processes, and the mouldings of the present invent ion are 
novel and form one aspect of the invention. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a pulp moulding for packaging 
an article, the moulding having a surface for facing said 
article, the surface consisting of one or more first areas 
to make initial contact with the article, and one or more 
second areas out of initial contact with the article, and 
where in at least one of said first areas comprises a region 
of different thickness from at least one of said second 
areas. The ability to provide deliberate and controlled

<CLAIMS>
A pulp moulding for packaging an article, the 
moulding having a surface for facing said article, the 

surface consisting of one or more first areas to make 
initial contact with the article, and one or more second 

areas out of initial contact with the article, and wherein 
at least one of said first areas comprises a region of 

different thickness from at least one of said second areas. 
A pulp moulding according to claim 1, wherein the 
first area(s) include(s) regions of different thickness. 
A pulp moulding according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the second area(s) include(s) regions of different 

thickness. 
A pulp moulding according to claim 1,2 or 3, 
wherein the variation in thickness is at least 2:1. 
A pulp moulding according to claim 1,2,3 or 4, 
wherein the thickness of the moulding is at constant 

moulding density. 
A pulp moulding according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the thickness variations are in a regular pattern. 
A pulp moulding according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
which is in the form of an open box. 
A method of making a pulp moulding as claimed in 
claim 1, which comprises providing a mesh mould, feeding 

aqueous pulp to one side of the mould, applying reduced 
pressure to the other side of the mould to draw water 

through the mesh, and form a pulp moulding on the said one 
side of the mesh, characterised in that the mesh mould is so 

formed that the pulp moulding has the defined thickness 
variations therein. 
A method according to claim 8, wherein the mesh 
mould comprises mesh on a support therefor. 
A method according to claim 9, wherein the mesh is 
made by SLA. 
A method according to claim 9 or 10, wherein the 
support is made by LOM. 
A method according to claim 11, wherein the LOM 
support has been impregnated with a polymer. 
A method according to claim 9, 10, 11 or 12, 
where in the dimensions of the mesh apertures vary in order 

to provide or contribute to the variations in thickness in 
the moulding. 
A method according to claim 9,10,11,12 or 13, 
wherein the support includes water flow channels dimensioned 

and positioned to control the water drawn through the mesh 
to provide or contribute to the variations in thickness in 

the moulding.
