<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of pneumatic tyres for vehicles, having a carcass extending between two bead rings and a belt arranged between the carcass and the tread, in which a green tyre is built up exclusively using nonmetallic constituents, and at least some of the requisite heat energy is introduced into the tyres in the form of microwave energy during the vulcanisation and shaping under the action of heat and pressure.

A method of manufacturing pneumatic vehicle tyres, having a carcass
extending between two bead rings and a breaker arranged between

carcass and tread, wherein at least a part of the thermal energy
required in the course of vulcanisation and shaping, which take

place under the action of heat and pressure, is introduced into the
tyre in the form of microwave energy, characterized in that the tyre

blank is built up using exclusively non-metallic components, and in
that the press mould consists of materials which have differential

microwave absorption and/or microwave permeability, with the different
material regions of the press mould being associated with tyre

regions which differ with respect to their construction.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the tyre
blank is first heated by microwave energy, and in that the microwave

heating is terminated before the onset of the vulcanisation reaction,
and in that the full vulcanisation, and also the profiling,

subsequently takes place under pressure and with the additional
supply of heat in the press mould.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the press mould is provided with single or multi-ply layers

for the provision of regions of different absorption and/or permeability
for the microwave energy.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that, during the supply of microwave energy, the power 

and/or the wave length is varied at least timewise, and in that the
supply of microwave energy is preferably effected intermittently.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that, during microwave heating, microwaves of different frequency

are simultaneously effective during predeterminable time
intervals.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the tyre is moved, and in particular rotated, relative to

the corresponding energy sources, during the introduction of microwave
energy.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the pressure in the press mould is varied in dependence

on the microwave power.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that materials which are mechanically at least substantially

neutral, but have increased microwave absorption characteristics,
are introduced into predeterminable regions of the tyre blank,

and/or are applied onto predeterminable regions of the tyre blank.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that, during the introduction of microwave energy into the

tyre blank, the energy density distribution is matched to the respective
tyre configuration through the manner and/or the location of

the coupling-in of energy and/or through optical elements. 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the tyre blank is introduced for uniform heating into an

annular wave-guide arrangement which has several coupling-in locations

for microwave energy arranged distributed over the periphery,
with microwave reflectors being used, in particular in the waveguide

arrangement intended to receive the tyre blank, in order to
smooth out the energy distribution, and with the position and/or

the alignment of the microwave reflectors preferably being changed
during the heating process.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that carbon fibres, aramides or the like are used as the material

for the bead rings, and in that aramide, nylon, rayon and the
like are used as the material for the breaker.
