<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to a stabilizing system for stabilizing 
a printed circuit board in a receiving slot of a card edge 
connector. U.S. Patent 3,399,372 discloses an adjusting system for 
very close tolerances in a card edge connector. U.S. 
Patent 5,106,311 discloses a connector for a flexible cable 
with a slider fitted into the housing to wedge the flexible 
cable into contact with electrical contacts. U.S. Patent 
5,203,725 discloses various types of biased card edge 
connectors. U.S. Patent 5,096,435 discloses a card edge 
connector with a cover that is moved down by a printed 
circuit board. U.S. Patent 4,756,694 discloses an angled 
card edge connector. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, 
an electrical connector is provided comprising a housing, 
a plurality of electrical contacts mounted to the housing, 
and a wedge. The housing has a card edge receiving area. 
The wedge is for locating an edge of a printed circuit 
board in a predetermined position in the card edge 
receiving area. The wedge is movably mounted to the 
housing with a first portion located in the card edge 
receiving area for being contacted by and moved with the 
printed circuit board as the board is inserted into the 
card edge receiving area.  In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention, an electrical connector is provided comprising 
a housing, a plurality of electrical contacts mounted to 
the housing, and wedge clips. The housing has a card edge 
receiving slot. The wedge clips are longitudinally 
slidingly mounted to the housing. The wedge clips have a 
spring section and a forward contact section. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention, an angled card edge connector is provided 
comprising a housing, a plurality of electrical contacts 
connected to the housing, and means for locating a card 
edge connection area of a printed circuit board. The 
housing has a first side for connection to a first printed 
circuit board and a card edge receiving slot located at an 
angle to the first side of less than 90째. The electrical 
contacts have tail ends extending from the first side of 
the housing. The means for locating can locate the card 
edge connection area of a second printed circuit board in 
the card edge receiving slot at a predetermined position. 
The means for locating comprises a wedge slidingly 
connected to the housing for pushing the card edge 
connection area against a side of the card

An electrical connector comprising: 
a housing (12) having a card edge receiving area (30); 

a plurality of electrical contacts mounted to the housing; 
and 

wedges (16) longitudinally movably mounted to the housing, 
and having a board contact section. 
A connector according to claim 1 wherein the wedge locates 
an edge (48) of a printed circuit board (18) in a 

predetermined position in the card edge receiving area, the 
wedge being movably mounted to the housing with a first 

portion (40) located in the card edge receiving area for 
being contacted by and moved with the printed circuit board 

as the board is inserted into the card edge receiving area. 
A connector according to claim 2 wherein the wedge 
includes a second portion for contacting the printed circuit 

board and pushing the printed circuit board against a side of 
the card edge receiving area. 
A connector according to claim 3 wherein the wedge 
includes a third portion (42) slidingly mounted in a slot 

(35) of the housing, the slot being located at an angle 
relative to the card edge receiving area. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 4 wherein 
the connector has two of the wedges; one at each end of the 

card edge receiving area. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 5 wherein 
 

the first portion (40) includes a spring section (38) adapted 
to be compressed by the printed circuit board as the board is 

inserted into the card edge receiving area. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 6 wherein 
the card edge receiving area is a slot angled relative to a 

first side of the housing at an angle of between about 30째 to 
about 60째. 
A connector according to claim 1 wherein the card edge 
receiving area is a slot, and the wedges are clips 

longitudinally slidingly mounted to the housing and further 
having a spring section. 
A connector according to claim 8 wherein the wedge clips 
are mounted in a channel of the housing, the channel being 

located at an angle to the card edge receiving slot. 
A connector according to claim 8 or 9 wherein the spring 
section is located, at least partially, in the card edge 

receiving slot such that a printed circuit board can contact 
the spring section as the board is inserted into the slot. 
A connector according to one of the claims 8 to 10 
wherein the wedge clips each include two wing sections 

extending from and offset from the board contact section. 
A connector according to one of the claims 8 to 11 
wherein the wedge clips are suitably shaped and mounted to 

the housing to be moved by and with a printed circuit board 
inserted into the card edge receiving slot. 
A connector according to one of the claims 8 to 12 
wherein the wedge clips are suitably shaped and mounted to
