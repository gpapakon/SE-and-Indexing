<ABSTRACT>
A train control system includes an equipment 
for issuing, to a train under control based on a 

predetermined train schedule, an operational target to 
be attained in terms of the aimed position, aimed time 

and aimed speed. Once a target is issued, a possible 
run region of the train is determined, and another 

target may be set within the possible run region such 
that the train is not subjected to the ATC-baed speed 

limitation or the like, thereby minimizing the cause of 

delay of the train operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a train control 
system for controlling the operation of trains that run 
based on a planned schedule. Conventionally, trains have been run by being 
dependent on the experience of train drivers. At the 
departure of one station, the driver is given only 
information on the scheduled arrival time and departure 
time of the next station. The driver runs the train by 
experience in consideration of the load factor, the 
slope in each railroad section, the speed limit imposed 
by signals and curves of railroad, the energy conservation, 
the ride comfort, etc., and uses a marginal time 
arbitrarily during a run and a stop at the next station 
until the departure time. If the train operation 
schedule is disrupted by bad weather or accident, the 
operation control equipment in the central control 
office determines a modified schedule and issues an 
inter-station run time that is based on the modified 
schedule to the train driver, and the driver runs the 
train within the modified inter-station run time. For the security of the train operation, there 
is used the automatic train control (ATC) system. The 
ATC system is designed to divide the railroad between 
stations into multiple sections and impose a speed limit  
 
on the rear-running (latter) train depending on the 
number of free sections left in the rear of the front-running 
(former) train, i.e., the less the number of 
free sections ahead of a train, the more severe speed 
limitation is imposed on the train, as described in 
Japanese patent publication JP-A-48-64604. Conventionally, the train driver uses a 
marginal time arbitrarily during the period between 
stations and does not known the immediate position and 
speed of the former train. Consequently, the train runs 
as usual even if the former train reduces the speed due 
to bad weather or accident, resulting in the application 
of the ATC-based speed limitation and the incompliance 
of the specified inter-station run time. Moreover, the 
speed limitation imposed on one train causes another 
speed limitation of the latter train, and this adverse 
effect propagates one after another to exhibit the 
"accordion phenomenon", resulting in an aggravated 
disruption of the operation schedule. During the recovery period of the disrupted 
schedule through the application of a modified schedule, 
the train driver who is allowed to use arbitrarily a 
marginal time included in the modified schedule tends to 
run the train at the highest-possible speed within the 
limit with the

<CLAIMS>
A train control system comprising: 

means (10000, 11000) mounted on the ground for 
generating aimed target information including position, 

time and speed for each train (20) in the system, 
means (200) mounted on each train (20) for 
generating a running pattern 

from the aimed target 
information, 
means (20200) mounted on each train (20) for 
effecting the operation of the train (20) in accordance 

with the running pattern, and 
means (101, 201) for communicating 
the aimed target information 

including the position, time and speed from the ground 
side to the train;
 
   characterized in that 

the means (10000, 11000) for generating the aimed target 
information is arranged: 


i) to generate initial target information on the 
basis of an operation schedule for each train, 
ii) to calculate possible run regions (408, 409) for each 
train on the basis of 

the initial target information, each possible run region 
being defined, on a distance-time plane, as the region 

confined by a first 
target point (404, 406), 

a second target point 
(405, 407), said points 

representing 
aimed train positions (s1, s2), aimed initial and final times (t1, t2) and 

aimed train speeds (v1, v2), and curves (311-320) joining said first and 
second target points, 
iii) to determine if a second, later-running, train  
 

will have to carry out a safety braking operation due to 
the relative position of a first, front running, train, 

on the basis of the possible run regions of the first and 
second trains; and 
iv) to revise the initial target information for 
the first or second train, if 

a safety braking operation would be 
necessary, in order to 

eliminate such a safety braking operation, 
by including an intermediate target defining an intermediate 

target point (412) in the distance-time plane within the 
possible run region of the second train, 

the revised initial 
target information forming 

said aimed target information. 
A train control system according to claim 1, wherein 
said curves (311-320) on the time-distance plane 

are comprised of a curve (311-315) which represents that the train comes to 
a stop from a certain position (s1) at a maximum deceleration 

and thereafter attains the second target point (s2, t2, v2) 
in a shortest time and 

a curve (316-320) which represents that the train starts from said 
certain position at a maximum acceleration, comes to a 

stop at the maximum deceleration and thereafter attains 
the second target poin
t (s2, t2, v2). 
A train control system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein there is further provided means 

(3000) for displaying said possible run regions on a 
train driver's console. 
A train control system according to claim 3, wherein  
 

there is further provided means for displaying the 
current position (3001) of train on a train driver's console. 
A train control system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein said safety braking is based on 

the automatic train control (ATC) brake system (20500).
