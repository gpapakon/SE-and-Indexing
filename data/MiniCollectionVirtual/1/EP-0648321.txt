<ABSTRACT>
Light-diffusing member comprising a plate (3) of a translucent material, with diffusers (5) projecting from a face (4) of said plate. The light-diffusing member also includes cells (8) for receiving the individual light elements (9) facing the diffusers (5) and opening onto a face (7) opposite the latter. The invention can be used specifically in traffic lights, in which an optical fibre bundle is used to transmit light to the light diffusing member.

<CLAIMS>
A light diffusion member associated with a light source 
comprising a series of punctiform light elements (9) characterised in 

that the light diffusion member comprises a plate (3) of material 
allowing light to pass and having diffusion studs (5) in projecting 

relationship on a face (4), and cavities (8) for receiving the punctiform 
light elements (9) which are disposed facing the diffusion studs (5) and 

open on to a face (7) opposite thereto. 
A light diffusion member according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the diffusion studs (5) have an aspherical surface. 
A light diffusion member according to claim 2 characterised in 
that the diffusion studs (5) have a rotationally symmetrical surface 

having an elliptical meridian. 
A light diffusion member according to claim 3 characterised in 
that the diffusion studs (5) are joined in side-by-side relationship. 
A light diffusion member according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the cavities (8) comprise a bottom spaced from the 

face (4) comprising the diffusion studs (5) by a distance (D) such that a 
beam issuing from an optical fibre (9) has an envelope circumscribed 

around a contour (6) of the diffusion stud (5) corresponding to the level 
of the face of the plate on which the diffusion studs are in projecting 

relationship.
