<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved 
safety switch (1) for application to motor vehicle 

power windows, characterized in that it comprises 
a base body (2) supporting thereon a pivoted push-button (3) 

swinging about a central fixed pin (4). 
On the push-button there is mounted, with 
an offset relationship, a suitable contoured covering 

element (10) which is adapted, as it is upwardly 
pulled,to operate the motor vehicle windows.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
safety switch, specifically designed for application
to motor vehicle power windows.As is known, prior power window switches
usually comprise a push-button by means of which
the window glasses of a motor-vehicle are caused
to be raised or lowered under the control of a driving
electric motor.These prior switches, however, have the drawback
that they are not fully reliable since the
mentioned push-button, which projects from an arm
element supported inside each door of the motor
vehicle, can be accidentally operated, for example
by the elbow, thereby causing the window glass to
be undesirably lowered or raised.This, as it should be apparent, could be
very dangerous for the motor vehicle passengers,
mainly for children.The document DE-A- 2 402 613 discloses a switch having substantially
the features of the preamble of Claim 1.Accordingly, the aim of the present invention
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, by
providing an improved safety switch specifically
designed for application to motor vehicle power 
windows, which is adapted to prevent the window
glasses for being accidentally operated.Within the scope of the above mentioned aim,
a main object of the present invention is to provide
such a switch which is very reliable and safe
in operation, can be easily made starting from easily
available elements and materials and which, moreover,
is very reliable from a mere economic standpoint.According to one aspect of the present invention,
the above mentioned aim and objects, as
well as yet other objects, which will become more
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a
motor vehicle power window safety switch, according to the main Claim.Further characteristics and advantages of
the invention will become more apparent from the
following detailed disclosure of a preferred,
though not exclusive, embodiment of a 
safety switch for motor vehicle power windows, which
is illustrated, by way of an indicative, but not
limitative example, in the accompanying drawings,
where:
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the main
component parts of the subject safety switch, before
the assembling thereof;Figure 2 is a perspective view of the switch
according to the present invention after the assembling
of its component parts;Figure 3 is a front cross-sectional view of
the subject safety switch, and specifically illustrating
the mode of operation thereof;Figure 4 is a side view of the switch according
to the invention;
andFigure 5 is a top plan view of the switch
according to

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle power window safety
switch (1) comprising a pivoted push-button (3)

swinging about a central fixed pin (4), thereon
there is offset arranged a contoured covering

element (10) allowing said push-button (3) to be
operated, characterized in that said switch

comprises a base body (2) supporting thereon said
swinging push-button (3), that to a portion of said

swinging push-button (3) there is provided a slot
(6) which, in cooperation with perforated support

elements (7), affixed to said base body (2), allows
the engagement therein of locking pins (9) for

locking on said switch said covering element (10),
and that in said covering element (10) a groove

(11) is formed, wherein as a hand finger is
introduced into said groove, for pulling upwardly

said covering element (10) a portion (8) of said
swinging push-button (3) is pressed downwardly,

thereby closing a contact element associated
therewith and causing a glass panel to be raised

and by downwardly pressing said covering element
(10), said contact element will be closed causing

said glass panel to be lowered, through the
pressure exerted on a further portion (5) of said 

swinging push-button (3).
A safety switch according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said covering element (10) is

snap engaged on said safety switch (1).
A safety switch for power windows
according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that

said covering element (10) is provided with a top
knurled portion (12).
