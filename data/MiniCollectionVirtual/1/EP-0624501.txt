<ABSTRACT>
Modular concept for the body of a doubledeck railway carriage body which is assembled from a number of modules which are conceived differently with respect to the purpose of use and design, the different modules being capable of being combined differently within an assigned range. A panorama module (1), a first class module (2) and a second class module (3) are present as upper deck modules. The three upper deck modules (1-3), which are provided with an integrated hollow chamber base plate, form, in terms of rigidity, the load-bearing part of the body of the carriage. Below the upper deck modules (1-3), the lower-deck passenger modules (5,7,8,9), the staircase modules (10,13), the entry modules (6), a technical module (4) and, at the ends, the intercommunicating modules (11,12) are added. A driver's stand module (14) completes the double-deck carriage body to form a control carriage body. The modules (1-14) are connected to one another with releasable connections in a positively and frictionally engaging and sealing fashion.

Module concept for a double-deck railway coach body which consists 
of a number of modules structured differently with regard to purpose 

of use and construction, wherein the different modules can be combined 
differently within an associated range, characterised thereby, that 

upper deck modules taking up pressure and bending forces and being in 
the form of a panoramic module (1), a first class module (2) and a 

second class module (3) and lower deck modules attachable at the 
undersides of the upper deck modules and in the form of an entry 

module (6), a first class module (5), a second class module (7), a 
business module (8), a family module (9), a technical module (4), a 

stair module (10, 13) and transition modules (11, 12) attachable at 
the end face sides and a driver's compartment module (14) are present 

and that the modules (1 to 14) are constructed to be assemblable in 
selectable combinations into a self-supporting double-deck railway 

coach body 
Double-deck railway coach body according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, that the modules (1 to 14) are constructed as inherently 

rigid, sealing space cells provided with connection fittings and duct 
passages and finished inside and to and with the outer skin. 
Double-deck railway coach body according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, that the stair modules (10, 13) and the technical module (4) 

are constructed at the underside for the reception of rail wheel 
bogies. 
Double-deck railway coach body according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, that the upper deck modules (1, 2, 3) are constructed at the 

underside at one end for the reception of a road wheel set and at the 
other and for the reception of a trailer support device.  

 
Double-deck railway coach body according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, tha
t the modules (1 to 13) are constructed individually or 
combined in several modules for the use as stationary space units and 

space combinations for office and dwelling purposes. 
Double-deck railway coach body according to claim 1 and 3, 
characterised thereby, that a module combination is present, which 

corrects the double-deck railway coach body with attached rail wheel 
bogies into a driving coach by attachment of the driver's compartment 

module (14).
