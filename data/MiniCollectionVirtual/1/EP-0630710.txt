<ABSTRACT>
The valve plate 1a for the sliding gate valve of a launder for metal melts has a solid, one-piece oval steel frame 2 which is distinguished by a high mechanical strength and high thermal resistance. Recesses 3 of any desired shape and holes 4 for cooling purposes and weight reduction are machined into the frame 2. The steel frame 2 encloses a refractory main body 5 made of cement or a similar material, in which a wearing part 6 designed, for example, as a ring is embedded. This wearing part has a throughflow opening 7 for the steel melt and is composed of a material which is resistant to high temperatures, cracking, peeling, erosion and chemical attack.   To produce valve plates 1a, the main body 5 composed of cement or a similar material is cast in the frame 2, which serves as a casting mould. In this process, casting templates with an opening corresponding to the opening in the frame are secured on the top and bottom sides of the frame 2 and the wearing part 6 is held on a locating stud of a bottom plate on which the frame 2 is placed together with the casting templates. The valve plate 1a is then dried at temperatures in a range of from 150 to 400 DEG C.

<CLAIMS>
Refractory valve plate (1a - 1e) provided with at least one sliding face (19,
20) for use in sliding gate valves in metallurgical vessels such as pouring

ladles and in distribution channels which receive a molten metal, provided
with a basic body (5) made of refractory material and an insert (6) moulded

in the basic body (5), which insert (6) has a through-flow opening (7) for the
molten mass, covers the displacement range of the plate and is made of a

material which is highly heat-resistant crack-resistant, peel-resistant,
erosion-resistant and chemically-resistant, and provided with a solid frame

(2) which is intended for multiple use and made of steel or a similarly high
strength material which has high mechanical strength and high thermal

resistance for receiving a basic body (5) which can be removed when worn,
the upper and lower sides of the basic body (5) protruding over the frame

(2), the insert (6) which is embedded in the basic body (5) and provided with
a through-flow opening (7) for the molten mass having a configuration which

is adapted to the respective sliding gate valve construction and the external
form of the valve plate (1e) corresponding to the external form of the

displaceable carrier frame of a sliding gate valve plate, characterised in that
the refractory material of the basic body (5) is poured into the frame (2) of

the valve plate (1a - 1e).
Method for producing valve plates for sliding gate valves according to claim
1, characterised in that a basic body (5) is poured into a solid frame (2)

serving as a mould, a casting template (11) with an opening (13) 
corresponding to the frame opening (12) being detachably mounted

respectively on the upper and lower side of the frame (2) and an insert (6)
being held on a fixing pin (16) of a base plate (17) on which the frame (2)

with the casting templates (11) is placed, the valve plate (1a - 1e) then being
dried at temperatures in a range of 150 to 400Â°C and subsequently the

upper and lower sides of the basic body (5), which is cast with an excess
thickness and held by the frame (2), are ground flat or plane-parallel to a

nominal thickness measurement (18) of the valve plate (1a - 1e).
