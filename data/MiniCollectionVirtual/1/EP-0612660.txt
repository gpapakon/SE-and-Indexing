<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the metering of especially pulverulent filling material, consisting of a drum (2), arranged rotatably under a product-feed apparatus (1), with outwardly open product-receiving compartments in the form of cylinders (3) located radially opposite one another and having pistons (4) and piston rods (5) of adjustable stroke, the pistons (4) of a cylinder row being respectively fastened by means of their piston rods (5) to a piston-actuating crosshead (6) extending inside the drum (2), the said crossheads (6) being capable of being connected operatively to lifting-movement elements via rollers (7) outside the drum (2). So that more than two diametrically opposite rows of cylinders can be provided on the drum and, at the same time, the suction or metering stroke can be adjusted, as desired, independently of the emptying stroke, such a device is designed, according to the invention, in such a way that the drum (2) is mounted at both ends, on a shaft (9) passing centrically through the drum (2), by means of an even number, corresponding to the number of cylinder rows (3'), of at least four radial spokes (8) and a piston-actuating crosshead (6) is respectively guided displaceably on the spokes (8) of a pair of spokes. A regulating lever (10) generating the full ejection stroke and a further regulating lever (11) generating the suction stroke are arranged in the regulating path of the crosshead roller (7) transversely relative to the shaft (9), rotatable regulating cams generating the lever adjustment being coupled to one another for synchronous rotation, and the regulating cam generating the suction stroke being arranged adjustably relative to the regulating lever (11) generating the suction stroke.

An arrangement for proportionating, in particular, pulverulent material to be loaded, 
comprising a drum (2) rotatably arranged underneath a product feeder (1) including 

externally open product-accommodating compartments in the form of radially opposing 
cylinders (3) with pistons (4) and piston rods (5) adjustable relative to the stroke thereof, 

wherein the pistons (4) of a row of cylinders (3') with the piston rods (5) thereof are 
secured respectively to a piston actuating bar (6) extending within the interior of the 

drum (2), which can be caused to cooperate externally of the drum (2), via rollers (7), 
with stroke moving elements, characterized in that the drum (2) on both ends thereof, 

through an even number of at least four radial spokes (8) corresponding to the number of 
the cylinder rows (3'), is arranged on a shaft (9) centrally passing through the drum (2), 

and respectively one piston actuating bar (6) is displaceably arranged on the spokes (8) 
of a pair of spokes (8'), and
 
that arranged within the operating range of the bar roller (7), in a direction transverse to 

the shaft (9), are a set lever (10) performing the full ejection stroke, and another set lever 
(11) performing the intake stroke, with rotatable set curves (12,12') effecting the lever 

adjustments being coupled to one another for rotation in synchronism, and the set curve 
(12') effecting the intake stroke being adjustably arranged relative to the set lever (11) 

effecting the intake stroke. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that at least four piston 
actuating bars (6), through ball guiding sleeves (13), are guided along the spokes (8).  

 
An arrangement according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the set curves 
(12,12') are designed in the form of eccenter disks (14). 
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the set 
lever (10) effecting the ejection stroke is a dual-arm angular lever arranged substantially 

centrally and swivably, the one arm (10') of which with the end thereof is in abutment 
with the set curve (12) and the other arm (10'') of which on the end thereof is provided 

with a transverse extension (15) under-passed by the bar rollers (7). 
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
superposed on the set lever (11) effecting the intake stroke is a second set lever (11') 

swivably arranged on the opposite end and extending in the opposite direction, with the 
end (17) thereof provided above the swivel bearing (16) of the set lever (11) being 

designed to adjust the distance relative to the swivel bearing (16), and that the set curve 
(12') acting on the end of the set lever (11) provided therebelow is arranged on the set 

lever (11'). 
An arrangement according to claim 5, characterized in that the superposed set lever 
(11') with the swivel bearing end (18) thereof is arranged on the same axis (19) as the 

rotatable set curve (12) for the set lever (10).
