<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method to map 
color signals in a device independent color space (DICS) to 

color signals in a device dependent color space (DDCS) for 
fast color calibration. The present invention combines two 

operations of gamut clipping and backward interpolation 
into one inverse look-up table (ILUT) which contains 

lattice color signals in the DICS as input signals. The 
ILUT is used during forward interpolation to map signals 

from the DICS to the DDCS. The ILUT is created using a 
gamut descriptor based on a given look-up table (LUT) which 

contains lattice color points in the DDCS as input signals. 
The gamut descriptor is generated by determining a set of 

gamut boundary points located on a series of parallel 
planes with fixed angles. When the ILUT is not available, 

the present invention uses a gamut descriptor for fast 
color signal conversion from the DICS to the DDCS.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the concurrently 
filed applications entitled Method And Apparatus For Convex 
Interpolation For Color Calibration by Wan, Miller and 
Sullivan having US serial number 068,823 and Method And 
Apparatus For Determining A Gamut Boundary And A Gamut 
Descriptor by Wan and having US serial number 068,887, both 
incorporated by reference herein. The present invention is directed to a fast 
mapping method and apparatus for converting data from one 
space to another space and creating an inverse look-up 
table for the conversion and, more particularly, to mapping 
using a gamut descriptor defining the boundaries of the 
gamut of a target device and to creating a color 
calibration inverse look-up table which will allow color 
values or signals, which have been converted from a first 
device dependent color space into color values or signals 
in a device independent color space, to be converted from 
the device independent color space into a second device 
dependent color space using a forward interpolation. Color information is stored in different color 
spaces for different devices. A color space is a 
coordinate system in which the colors reproducible by the 
device are points or signals in the coordinate system. For 
example, RGB color space which has color axes of red (R), 
green (G) and blue (B) is used for CRTs and CMY color space 
which has color axes of cyan (C), magenta (M) and yellow 
(Y) is used for printers. Both RGB and CMY are device 
dependent color spaces with signal values or code values 
typically ranging from 0 to 255. To reproduce a color 
image generated for one device on another device, a color  
 
calibration process is required. One goal of the color 
calibration process is to find a mapping from one device-dependent 
color space (DDCS) to another DDCS, so that 
colors can be reproduced correctly. U.S. Patent 4,500,919 
describes one way of performing such a transformation. A 
common approach to color calibration is to introduce a 
device independent color space (DICS) such as CIELAB or 
(L*a*b*) or CIELUV (L*u*v*) or CIEXYZ between two DDCSs. The relationship between a DDCS and a DICS can be 
established by a 3Dâ†’3D look-up table (LUT), which may be 
conventionally obtained by measuring a number of color 
patches generated from the specific device. For 
convenience, the code values of these color patches are 
usually chosen to be lattice points spanning the full range 
of the DDCS, while their corresponding points in the DICS 
may be distributed
