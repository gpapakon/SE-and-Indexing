<ABSTRACT>
A method and system in a distributed data processing system 
for efficiently transmitting a selected subset of source data in 

response to a request from a requesting workstation connected to 
the source processor via a communication link. The presentation 

characteristics of the requesting workstation are determined in 
response to the workstation's request for the transmission of 

source data. Thereafter, a subset of the source data suitable 
for presentation by the requesting workstation is selected in 

response to the determination of the presentation characteristics 
of the requesting workstation. Finally, the selected subset of 

source data is transmitted from the source processor to the 
requesting workstation via the communications link, thereby more 

efficiently utilizing the capacity of the communications link.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an improved data 
processing system, and in particular to an improved method and 
system for efficiently transmitting source data from a source 
processor to a requesting workstation within a data processing 
system via a communications link. Within a data processing system, a system data bus may be 
utilized to transmit data to and from a central processing unit, 
direct access storage devices, communications input/output 
processors (IOPs), and other peripheral devices. Typically, only 
one of the several devices connected to the system data bus is 
able to transmit at any given moment. One of the parameters 
which establishes the volume of information that the system data 
bus can transfer within a given period of time, or the capacity 
of the system data bus, is the bandwidth of the system data bus. 
The bandwidth of a data bus is the rate, expressed in bytes per 
second, at which data can be conveyed from a source to a target, 
such as a workstation or other receiving device connected on the 
bus. Such bandwidth is limited by the electrical characteristics 
of the transceivers connected to the system data bus, and the 
electrical characteristics of the system data bus itself.  Similarly, a communication link may be utilized to transmit 
data from a source processor to a workstation within a 
distributed data processing system. Such a communication link 
also has a finite bandwidth which limits the capacity or volume 
of information that may be transmitted via the communications 
link. In data bus design, and in communication link design, data 
transmission capacity is a resource that may be divided among 
several devices connected to such communication channels. As 
more devices are connected to such communications channels, and 
as the volume of data communicated between devices on such 
channels increases, the need to conserve channel capacity and 
optimize channel usage becomes increasingly important. Recently, data processing systems have been utilized to 
process, present, and transmit files containing multimedia data. 
Multimedia data is a collection of "time-related" or "time-based" 
data files which may be utilized to represent video, sound, and 
animation. Such multimedia data files are typically quite large. 
For example, at 300 pixels per inch and 24 bits per pixel, an 8 
1/2-by-11-inch color picture requires more than 25 megabytes of 
data storage. In order for a workstation to "play back" the digital audio 
portion of a multimedia
