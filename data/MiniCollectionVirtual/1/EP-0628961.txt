<ABSTRACT>
A tensioning mechanism for use in tensioning a 
magnetic tape used in recording and playback apparatus 

employs a rotatably mounted fan shaped plate (119) with 
an arcuate toothed edge region (119a) drivably engaged 

with a drive gear wheel (118). A lever (122) carries a 
pin (123) which is located in a guide groove (121) in the 

fan-shaped plate (119). A pinch roller (129) is carried 
at one end of an L-shaped pinch lever (126) which is 

pivotably mounted and biased with a spring (133) to bring 
the roller (129) away from a capstan (130). The lever 

(122) is coupled to the other end of the pinch lever 
(126) with the aid of another spring (131) and an 

intermediate plate (124). As the gear wheel (118) is 
driven the fan-shaped plate (119) rotates to displace the 

pin (123) and the lever (122) and then the pinch lever 
(126) to urge the roller (12a) against the capstan (130) 

and the roller (129) is then held by the other spring 
(131).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a tape tensioning mechanism
for a magnetic tape recording and playback apparatus with
a magnetic tape loading mechanism, in particular, a
helical scan system as used in a video tape recorder and
digital audio tape recorder.In a conventional magnetic tape recording and
playback apparatus with a helical scan system, a rotating
drum equipped with a magnetic head device that has
rotating magnetic heads is, for example, installed on a
mechanical chassis in a state coaxial with a fixed drum.
A magnetic tape is made to run along the peripheries of
these drums so that when the heads rotate at high speed,
recording tracks are formed at an inclined angle on the
tape. In this way, signals may be recorded or played
back.In such a magnetic tape recording and playback
apparatus, there is provided a loading mechanism which
takes out the tape from a tape cassette, and winds it
around the drums automatically. This loading mechanism
comprises a loading block with tape guides, such as a
return guide and an inclined guide which engage with and
guide the magnetic tape.The loading block may be driven by a rotating member
such as a loading ring which rotates so as to bring the 
tape from the cassette to a specific loading position
near the drums. The rotating member is driven by a
motor and the position of the loading block is detected
by a switch.This magnetic tape recording and playback
apparatus also has a pinch roller pressure mechanism
which presses a pinch roller on a capstan. The pressure
mechanism may comprise a pinch arm which is for example
free to pivot at one end, the other end thereof being
fitted with the pinch roller, and the pinch roller being
pressed to the capstan by the action of a solenoid or of
a control motor and cam.In this apparatus, when the pinch roller is
pressed against the capstan (i.e. when the pinch roller
is ON), the magnetic tape runs at a constant rate, and
when the pinch roller is released from the capstan (i.e.
when the pinch roller is OFF), the magnetic tape can be
moved in fast forward or rewind mode etc. Figs. 3 and 4 are plan views of a
conventional magnetic tape recording and playback
apparatus in states of loading and unloading,
respectively, as disclosed in Utility Model Application
Laid-Open No. 105938/1986. In the figures 501 is a
chassis, 502 and 503 are guide grooves formed on chassis
501, and 504 and 505 are tape loading blocks. 506 and
507 are stoppers for stopping tape loading blocks 504 and
505 at specific positions. 510 is a rotating drum, and
511 is a

<CLAIMS>
A tape tensioning mechanism for a magnetic tape recording and playback
apparatus, said mechanism comprising a pivotable member (545) in the form of a fan

shaped plate which is pivotable about a first pivot (547), a tension arm (511A) which is
pivotable, a first spring (515A) operably connected to the tension arm (511A) and a

tension post (512), provided on the tension arm (511A), wherein the tension post is
either separated from a magnetic tape (550) and inoperative or is urged against a

magnetic tape (550) by the first spring (515A) and is operative to tension the tape and
the pivotable member (545) is provided with a device which serves to move the tension

arm (511A) in such a direction that the tension post (512) is separated from the magnetic
tape in opposition to the force of the first spring (515A); characterised in that the tension

arm (511A) is pivotable about a second pivot (514) spaced from the first pivot (547) and
the device comprises a pin (546) attached to the pivotable member (545) and a

transmission arm (540) engageable with the pin (546) which engages with and moves the
tension arm (511A) in such a direction that the tension post (512) is separated from the

magnetic tape when the transmission arm (540) is free of engagement with the pin (546).
A mechanism according to claim 1, wherein the transmission arm (540) is
pivotable about a third pivot (541), and the device further comprises a second spring

(542) for urging the transmission arm (540) in such a direction as to engage with the
tension arm (511A) to cause the tension post (512) to be separated from the magnetic

tape (550). 
A mechanism according to claim 2, wherein the tension arm (511A), the first
spring (515A), the pivotable member (545), and the transmission arm (540) are all

movable between first positions and second positions,

   the arrangement being such that when the tension arm (511A), the first spring
(515A), the pivotable member (545) and the transmission arm (540) are in their

respective first positions, the tension post (512) is separated from the magnetic tape
(550), and when the pivotable member (545) is moved from its first position to its

second position, the transmission arm (540) is moved from its first position to its second
position, due to engagement with the pin (546), against the biasing force of the second

spring (542), and the tension arm (511A) is moved from its first position to its second
position due to the biasing force of the first spring (515A) so that the tension post (512)

is urged against the magnetic tape (550) due to the force of the first spring (515A).
A mechanism according to claim 3, wherein when the pivotable member (545) is
moved from its second position to its first position, the transmission arm (540) is moved

from its second position to its first position, due to the force of the second spring (542),
the tension arm (511A) is moved from its second position to its first position, by

engagement with the transmission arm (540) and overcoming the force of the first spring

(515A), so that the tension post (512) is separated from the magnetic tape (550).
A mechanism according to claim 4, further comprising means (599) for driving
the pivotable member (545) between its first and second positions. 
A mechanism according to claim 5, and further comprising a gear portion (598)
formed on the periphery of the pivotable member (545), and a gear (599) which engages

with the gear portion (598) and drives the pivotable member (545), said gear (598)
forming part of said means (599) for rotating the pivotable member (545).
