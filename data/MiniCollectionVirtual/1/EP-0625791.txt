<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic convergence device in a color cathode-ray 
tube has two pairs of confronting high- and low-voltage electrode 

plates disposed in a color cathode-ray tube bulb and 
arranged such that a central electron beam will pass between 

the high-voltage electrode plates and side electron beams 
will pass between the high-voltage electrode plates and the 

low-voltage electrode plates. A first parallel-connected 
circuit is composed of a first resistor and a first diode 

which are connected between the low-voltage electrode plates 
and a high DC voltage source. A second parallel-connected 

circuit is composed of a second resistor and a second diode 
which are connected between the high-voltage electrode plates 

and the high DC voltage source. A convergence voltage source 
generates a convergence voltage which is composed of a vertical 

parabolic wave voltage added to a modulated voltage in 
horizontal blanking intervals thereof which is produced by 

amplitude-modulating a horizontal parabolic wave with a vertical 
parabolic wave. A first capacitor is connected between 

the convergence voltage source and the low-voltage electrode 
plates or the high-voltage electrode plates, and a second capacitor 

is connected between the low-voltage electrode plates 
or the high-voltage electrode plates and ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dynamic 
convergence device in a color cathode-ray tube in 
accordance with the precharacterizing parts of the 
independent claims 1, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Such a 
dynamic convergence device is known from US-A-3452240. When the deflecting magnetic field of a 
deflection yoke is a uniform magnetic field in an in-line 
three-beam color cathode-ray tube, convergence errors in 
the shape of vertical bows are produced on the screen of 
the color cathode-ray tube, as shown in FIG. 1 of the 
accompanying drawings. In FIG. 1, R and B represent 
patterns produced by opposite side beams, i.e., red and 
blue beams. Many color cathode-ray tubes are designed to 
accomplish dynamic convergence by imparting a large 
distortion, e.g., a barrel distortion or a pincushion 
distortion, to the deflecting magnetic field generated by 
the deflection yoke. However, this approach has a problem 
because it tends to distort electron beam spots or put them 
out of focus on a peripheral region of the screen of the 
color cathode-ray tube. One solution has been to generate a uniform 
magnetic field from a deflection yoke and pass a 
convergence current through a quadrupole coil disposed 
behind the deflection yoke. Because the deflecting magnetic 
field is still distorted, distortions of electron beams 
spots in the peripheral region of the screen of the color 
cathode-ray tube can -  
 
not fully be removed. Furthermore, the fact that the convergence 
current passing through the quadrupole coil is controlled 
makes this convergence design unsuitable for use in a 
multiple scanning frequency monitor, and makes it difficult 
to carry out accurate waveform control, resulting in difficulty 
in fine adjustment of the convergence in small areas on 
the screen. In some special applications, a convergence voltage 
modulated by an external transformer is applied through a 
coaxial cable to the convergence plate of an electron gun. 
Though the application of such a convergence voltage is effective 
to improve the convergence in the peripheral region 
of the screen of the color cathode-ray tube, the arrangement 
is expensive and cannot be introduced into color television 
sets for consumer use since the external transformer is a 
high-voltage transformer. There has also been proposed a dynamic convergence 
device having a high resistor connected between a pair of inner 
electrodes and a pair of outer electrodes in a color 
cathode-ray tube, and conductive layers disposed respectively 
on inner and outer
