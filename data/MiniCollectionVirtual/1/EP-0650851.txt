<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording material and,
more particularly, it relates to recording material which may be
used in common for various output printing machines widely used
for business and home uses such as ink-jet printing machines, PPC
machines and direct thermal transfer printing machines.Hitherto, various kinds of recording paper have been
developed depending on the kinds of printing machines such as
direct thermal transfer printing machines, PPC machines, pen
plotters and ink-jet printing machines. For example, for the use
in ink-Jet printing, though ordinary paper may be used for this
printing method, there have been proposed various kinds of
recording paper provided with ink-receiving layers which consist
of porous layers or comprise water-soluble resins such as
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and gelatin. Such
recording paper for ink-jet printing must have good ink
absorbency and water resistance and therefore there has been
proposed recording paper of which ink receiving layer comprises a
graft copolymer and/or a block copolymer so that it satisfies the 
both requirements of water absorbency and water resistance
(Japanese Patent Un-examined Publication JP-A-61-21780).However, polymerization for preparing such a block copolymer
is a troublesome task and, moreover, the performance of
resulting copolymers could not be completely sufficient.There have been also proposed various kinds of recording
paper other than the ones mentioned above in order to satisfy the
requirements of water absorbency and water resistance, for
example, those utilizing, as the resin contained in the ink-receiving
layer, hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (hereinafter
referred as "PVP") and an acidic component of (meth)acrylic
polymers
(EP-A-233703;
Japanese Patent Un-examined Publication JP-A-62-218181)
or specific (meth)acrylic polymers (Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication JP-A-62-222884 and JP-A-63-173678).
However, those utilizing (meth)acrylic polymers alone
have drawbacks, i.e., bad ink absorbency and extremely low ink
drying rate. Moreover, acidic (meth)acrylic polymers show bad
compatibility with PVP and therefore, when mixed with PVP, they
present drawbacks that it is difficult to obtain uniform coatings
and it is difficult to adjust physical properties of coatings.When designing ink-receiving layers of recording
materials for ink-jet printing, ink absorption and retention
properties had been considered with respect only to aqueous inks. 
But, there have recently been proposed certain
