<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a regulator for a 
variable displacement pump; and, more particularly, to a 
regulator provided with a hydraulic servo controller capable 
of controlling the displacement volume of the pump and 
accomplishing a feedback function depending upon the working 
pressure from the pump, an effective spring force and a pilot 
pressure to achieve a stable flow rate and reduce energy 
losses. A conventional variable displacement pump comprises a 
regulator which employs a device for controlling the angle of 
a swash plate therein. For example, Japanese Laid-Open 
Publication No. 89-116294 discloses a regulator comprising: a 
valve body; means for controlling the angle of a swash plate; 
a directional changeover valve defining a position for 
supplying a working pressure to a first chamber, a position 
for sealing the first chamber and a position for discharging 
the load pressure from the first chamber; a feedback lever for 
connecting an end of the changeover valve with a servo-piston 
of the control means; a first pilot spool movable by the  
 
working pressure from the pump for controlling the horsepower 
thereof; a second pilot spool movable by the pilot pressure, 
wherein a reservoir pressure is included, for controlling the 
flow rate of the pump; and a linkage mechanism for selectively 
applying one of the first and the second pilot spools to the 
feedback lever to reduce the discharge flow rate thereof. However, the linkage mechanism of the regulator 
complicates the overall structure and construction thereof. 
Further, since the flow rate of the pump is likely to be 
affected by a variation in the reservoir pressure of the 
hydraulic system during the flow rate control, it is difficult 
to achieve and maintain a predetermined target flow rate. 
In addition, the regulator is handicapped by the absence of a 
flow rate cutoff control and a flow rate cutoff release 
control, thereby causing an energy loss due to its inability 
to prevent an unnecessary discharge flow. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a regulator for a variable displacement pump having a 
simplified structure by eliminating the linkage mechanism. It is another object of the present invention to provide 
a regulator for a variable displacement pump capable of 
accomplishing a stable flow rate control by eliminating the 
effect of the reservoir pressure of the hydraulic system.  
 It is still another object of the present invention to 
provide a regulator for a variable

A variable displacement pump incorporating therein a 
regulator for controlling t-he flow rate of a fluid therein by 

means of varying the angle of a swash plate, which comprises: 

a pump for producing a flow of the fluid; 
a valve body (11) in fluid-communication with the pump; 
a servo-piston (16) pivotally mounted to the swash plate and 
provided with two portions, each having a different diameter, 

which are movable along a first and a second chambers (20, 22) formed 
within the valve body; 
a multi-stage piston (42) movable along a first and a second 
piston compartments (44, 46) in the valve body (11) by a working pressure 

from the pump; 
a control rod (36) movable along an axis of the servo-piston (16) 
and having a servo-spool (28) for changing the direction of the 

flow; 
a servo-sleeve (34) in fluid-communication with the servo 
spool (28) for defining a neutral position, a position for 

supplying the working pressure of the second chamber (22) and a 
position for discharging the working pressure to a 

reservoir; 
a cut-off spool (26) in fluid-communication with the servo 
sleeve (34) for defining a position for supplying the working 

pressure from the pump to the second chamber and a position  
 

for discharging the working pressure from the second chamber 
to the servo sleeve (34); and 
means (38, 40) for biasing the control rod and the servo-piston to 
be spaced apart from each other. 
The variable displacement pump as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said variable displacement pump further comprises a 

control valve (64) for supplying a pilot pressure to a pilot 
chamber (52) in which the control rod (36) is located, and a drain 

chamber. 
The variable displacement pump as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said cutoff spool (26) has a cutoff piston, movable along 

a first and a second cutoff piston compartments (70, 74) communicating 
with the pump and a pilot line. 
The variable displacement pump recited in claim 
1, wherein said biasing means has an outer spring (38) located 

between the control rod and the servo-piston and an inner 
spring (40) having a smaller diameter and a shorter length than 

those of the outer spring, which is located within the outer 
spring. 
The variable displacement pump as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said pilot pressure from the gear pump (Pg) is supplied via  

 
a reducing valve (76) to a third piston compartment (56) formed with in 

the valve body to increase the working pressure applied to the 
multi-stage piston. 
The variable displacement pump as recited in claims 1 and 4, 
wherein said control rod (36), said servo-piston (16), said multi-stage 

piston (42) and said springs (38, 40) have a coaxial relationship with one 
another.
