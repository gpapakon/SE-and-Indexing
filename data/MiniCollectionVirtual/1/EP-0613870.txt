<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the reutilization of vegetable material (vegetable matter) containing water (1), this material is comminuted and the cells are disrupted by mechanical means (16), preferably with an addition of water. Suitable for the disruption of the cells are, in particular, punched-disk mills, corundum disk mills, toothed colloid mills or hammer mills. The vegetable material processed according to the invention can either be subjected to intermediate storage or incorporated, or applied, directly to the soil or the vegetation canopy. For the management of high-quality lawns, the vegetable material whose cells have been disrupted is preferably additionally filtered or separated in another manner into fibrous component and liquid component. While the high-nutrient, valuable liquid component (cell contents) is distributed onto the lawn, the fibrous component (cell walls) is reutilized in another manner. The process can be carried out using stationary or mobile devices. In the latter case, the device is employed on its own or in combination with a lawn mower, so that the grass cuttings can be cut, comminuted, subjected to cell disruption and reapplied in one or more passes.
