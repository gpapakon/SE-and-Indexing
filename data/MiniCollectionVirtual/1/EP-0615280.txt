<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic chuck having an insulating layer 
comprising a solid-solution comprising alumina and a 

transition metal oxide having the structure of a 
corundum, and preferably a glass component present in 

grain boundaries of the solid-solution grains. The 
transition metal oxide is a transition metal oxide 

capable of forming a solid solution with alumina, 
specifically including chromia (Cr₂O₃), whose crystal 

structure is similar to alumina, having the structure of 
a corundum. The electrostatic chuck exhibits a stable 

electrostatic performance without regard to operating 
temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatic
chuck used to attractively fix articles such as
semiconductor wafers by electrostatic force.Electrostatic chucks provided with an internal
electrode between a substrate and an insulating layer
(dielectric layer) are used as wafer fixing jigs when
semiconductor wafers are treated by plasma etching, CVD,
ion plating or the like.Such electrostatic chucks are required to perform
so that a great electrostatic attractive force is
produced during the application of voltage so that the
attracted articles are prevented from falling, and that
after removing the applied voltage the electrostatic
attractive force is immediately decreased so that the
attracted articles can be displaced with ease.Means for increasing the electrostatic attractive
force include, for example, means in which the
insulating layer has a large dielectric constant
(Japanese Patent Publications No. 60-59104 and No. 62-19060),
the thickness of the insulating layer is
controlled (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No.
57-64950) and the insulating layer has a volume
resistivity in a given range (Japanese Patent
Publication No. 61-14660 and Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication No. 2-22166). Means for making the
displacement of attracted articles easy include, for
example, means in which helium gas is blown between the
chuck surface and an attracted article (Japanese Utility
Model Laid-open Publication No. 2-120831) and applying a
voltage with a polarity opposite to the voltage applied
when the wafers are attracted (Japanese Patent
Publication No. 2-63304).Among the above-mentioned conventional means, the
means for increasing the electrostatic attractive force 
rely only on the insulating layer, where the residual
attractive force tends to become larger with an increase
in electrostatic attractive force. Furthermore, with
such means it takes as long as at least 60 seconds
before the residual attractive force attenuates and the
attracted article can be displaced with ease. This is
unsuitable for those instances in which attracted
articles should be displaced immediately after
treatment. Hence, in such cases there is the
disadvantage that other devices or additional operations
other than the usual operations have to be used in order
to make the displacement of attracted articles easy. In
particular, there is a problem when such devices are
used in a low temperature environment.One reason for these problems is that the materials
constituting the insulating layer (dielectric layer) of
conventional
