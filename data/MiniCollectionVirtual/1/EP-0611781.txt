<ABSTRACT>
A polymer composition composed of the reaction 
product of a hydrophilic monomer and an acyclic monomer is 

disclosed. The preferred hydrophilic monomer is 
hydroxyethyl methacrylamido (HMA), and the preferred 

acyclic monomer is hydroxyoctyl methacrylate (HOMA). The 
monomeric components can be polymerized in a polystyrene 

mold to make contact lenses, and when swollen with water, 
are suitable for use as soft hydrogel contact lenses. 
The preferred compositions also include a 
zwitterionic monomer, such as a sulfobetaine, and a 

crosslinking agent, such as ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate 
(EGDMA). 
Hydrogel contact lenses made from these polymers 
exhibit high water content and mechanical strength, and 

are compatible with polystyrene molds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polymer derived from the
reaction of hydrophilic monomeric components. More
specifically, it relates to such a polymer incorporating
an acyclic monomeric component especially adapted for use
in the preparation of ophthalmic lenses, particularly soft
hydrogel contact lenses.The fabrication of thin hydrogel contact lenses with
high water contents is one of the driving forces behind
new developments in the ophthalmic art. Lenses with high
water contents provide the cornea of the wearer with the
oxygen it needs to maintain normal metabolism. Thus, a
high degree of patient comfort can be obtained even though
the lens may remain intact on the cornea for extended
periods of time.Unfortunately, high water content hydrogels are
generally characterized by poor mechanical properties.
This means that thin contact lenses made from these high
water content hydrogels have poor mechanical properties,
and therefore are very difficult to handle. It has
therefore been desirable to develop high water content
hydrogels, which have good mechanical properties.
Unfortunately, these two properties are often inconsistent
with one another.One known method for improving the mechanical
toughness of hydrogel lenses is to add monomers with 
hydrophobic character to the polymerization reaction
mixture from which the lens is derived. Such monomers
include lauryl methacrylate. Hydrophobic monomers tend to
reduce the equilibrium water content, and thus the oxygen
permeability of hydrogel polymers. This in turn causes an
associated increase in patient discomfort and corneal
swelling when the lens is placed on the cornea for
extended periods of time.The water content of the lens can be increased by the
addition of highly hydrophilic monomers; however, there
are two drawbacks associated with this remedy. The use of
anionic monomers such as methacrylic acid results in
hydrogels with high affinities for certain proteins, e.g.
lysozyme. Alternatively, the addition of non-ionic
hydrophilic monomers such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA)
or N-vinylpyrrolidinone (NVP) can cause the resulting
monomer blend to dissolve polystyrene. This factor is
significant because it is often desirable to use
polystyrene molds to form lenses.Accordingly, interesting attempts have been made to
develop hydrogels with high water content, good mechanical
properties, and acceptable compatibility with polystyrene
molds. For example, U.S. Patent 5,006,622 discloses soft
hydrogel contact lenses prepared from the reaction product
of a branched
