<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polycarbonate resins 
and more particularly to thermoplastic, aromatic 
polycarbonate resins useful for molding articles 
which are stable under relatively high temperature 
conditions. Phenolphthalein, as a dihydric phenol 
reactant, has been used to prepare polycarbonate 
resins; see for example the disclosures in U.S. 
Patents 3,036,036; 3,036,037; 3,036,039; 4,078,999; 
4,167,536; and 4,310,652. Phenolphthalein has also 
been used as a reactant in admixture with 
bisphenol-A to prepare copolycarbonate resins; see 
for example Lin, M.S. and E.M. Pearce, Polymers 
With Improved Flammability Characteristics, II: 
Phenolphthalein Related Copolycarbonates, Journal 
of Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition, 
(1981) 19: p.2151-2160. Poly(ester-carbonates) 
prepared with phenolphthalein reactant are also 
known; see U.S. Patent 4,310,652. The phenolphthalein copolycarbonates exhibit 
excellent ductility and high heat-distortion 
temperatures. However, the presence of even small 
quantities of phenolphthalein residues in the 
product resins, or in the brine medium used in 
preparation affords discolored resin and recycle 
water (pink coloration). This is not desirable for 
many commercial purposes. It has also been  
 
reported (Lin, M.S. and E.M. Pearce, Polymers With 
Improved Flammability Characteristics. I. 
Phenolphthalein Related Homopolymers. Journal of 
Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition, (1981) 
19: p.2659-2670) that phenolphthalein based 
polycarbonate resins are difficult to melt process 
because of cross-linking and chain scission through 
the lactone ring; see also Lin, M.S., B.J. Bulkin, 
and E.M. Pearce, Thermal Degradation Study of 
Phenolphthalein Polycarbonates, Journal of Polymer 
Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition, (1981) 19: 
p.2773-2797 at page 2774. Certain derivatives of phenolphthalein have 
also been used as dihydric phenols to prepare 
polycarbonate resins. For example, Lin and Pearce, 
I: Pgs. 2151-2160, supra., describe preparation of 
polycarbonate homopolymer resins wherein 3,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)phthalimidine 
and 2-phenyl-3,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl) 
phthalimidine were separately 
polymerized (phosgenated). We have found the copolymerization of 3,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)phthalimide 
with bisphenol-A 
polycarbonate to be extremely difficult because of 
what appears to be concurrent side reactions 
through the amide hydrogen during polymerization. 
These side reactions cause emulsification during 
interfacial polymerizations, which hinders pH
