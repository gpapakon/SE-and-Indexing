<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a binding element intended to retain the end of a boot. It comprises a body which carries a jaw (8). The jaw (8) is movable vertically and its movement is transmitted to the return spring of the jaw, which compensates for a rearward fall. The boot sole is pinched between a support plate (25) and the sole gripper (13) of the jaw. The support plate is mounted movably about a longitudinal and horizontal axis (shaft) so that twisting of the boot causes the jaw to rise and thus the compensation means to be activated.

Alpine ski binding element adapted to retain the end 
of a boot sole and to release this end during an excessive 

bias, comprising: 

a base (7, 37, 67) adapted to be connected to the ski, 
a body (6, 36, 66, 121) mounted on the base, 
a retention jaw (2, 8, 38, 68) for the boot borne by 
the body at least partially movable in a horizontal plane, 
the jaw comprising two wings for the lateral retention 
of the boot and a sole-clamp (13, 39, 73) for vertical 

retention, 
at least each of the lateral retention wings being 
movable in a horizontal plane in response to the biases of the 

boot, against the force developed by a return spring (15, 45, 
75) housed in the body, 
the sole-clamp (13, 39, 73) being movable along a 
vertical 
direction, 
a first compensation mechanism connecting the sole-clamp 
and the main spring, said mechanism comprising movable 

linkage members and being provided to reduce the return force 
exerted by the spring on the wings during an upward vertical 

bias exerted on the sole-clamp, 
a support element (25, 55, 86) in the vicinity of the 
jaw, provided to support the front portion of the boot sole, 

the support element having a support surface located at a 
distance from the sole-clamp corresponding to the thickness of 

a standardized boot sole, 
 
   characterized in that the support element (25, 55, 86) is 

a support plate (25, 55, 86) pivotally mounted about a 
longitudinal pivotal axis (26, 56, 88) located in its median 

portion.  
 
Element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the support element is a support plate (25, 55, 86) movable in 

a rolling manner about a defined axis (26, 56, 88) oriented 
longitudinally and located in the central portion of the 

element. 
Element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
a compensating mechanical linkage (30, 57, 90, 95) connects 

the support plate to one of the movable members of the first 
compensating mechanism, and that the linkage is provided to 

amplify the reducing effect of the first compensating 
mechanism with the rocking of the support plate. 
Element according to claim 3, where the body (6) is 
connected to its base (7) through a journal (22) about a 

transverse axis, where the wings (9, 10) are connected to the 
return spring (15) by a movable tie rod (16), where the first 

compensating mechanism comprises a rocker (30) which has an 
oblige arm (24) journalled an one side to the base (7), and 

on the other to the head of the tie rod, characterized in that 
the linkage between the support plate (25, 86) and the first 

compensating mechanism comprises a second arm (33) of the 
rocker against which the support plate (25, 86) exerts a 

supporting force. 
Element according to claim 4, where the first 
compensating mechanism comprises a jaw (38) movable along a 

vertical direction, and journalled to the body about a 
transverse axis (41), at least one connecting rod (48, 49) 

inserted between the jaw and the main spring (45), 
characterized in that the compensating mechanical linkage 

comprises a rocker (57) journalled about a transverse axis 
(58), an arm (61) of which is engaged beneath the support  

 
plate (55), and another arm (59, 60) is engaged beneath the 

jaw. 
Element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
a latch (95, 107) connects the support plate (86) to one of 

the members of the binding element, which are the base, the 
body, and the jaw, and releases said member with respect to 

the member on which it is mounted, or the member which carries 
it, that a linkage connects the support plate to the latch, 

and that this linkage is provided to open the latch with the 
rocking of the support plate. 
Element according to claim 6, where the base (67) 
comprises an upper plate (100) connected to a lower base plate 

(101) about a substantially vertical pivot (102), and a latch 
(95, 107) located between the upper plate and the lower base 

plate, characterized in that the support plate (86) is 
connected to the latch by a rocker (90) journalled about a 

transverse axis, an arm of which is engaged beneath the 
support plate (86), and the other arm is in support against 

the latch. 
Element according to claim 7, where the jaw 
comprises two wings (69, 70) connected to the main spring (75) 

by a movable piston (76) guided in the body, where the body 
(66) is connected to the base (67) about a transverse axis 

(80) carried by the upper plate (100), where a connecting rod 
(82) connects the upper portion of the body (66) and the arm 

of the rocker (81) journalled about a transverse axis (83) 
borne by the body, the arm being further in support against 

the piston, characterized in that the rocker (81) comprises a 
second arm (96) against which the latch (95, 107) is in 

support.  
 
Alpine ski binding element adapted to retain the end 
of a boot sole and to release this end during an excessive 

bias, comprising:

a retention jaw (130, 131) for the boot borne by the 
body at least partially movable in a horizontal plane, the jaw 

comprising two wings for the lateral retention of the boot, 
the jaw being movable in a horizontal plane in response 
to the biases of the boot, against the force developed by a 

return spring (128) housed in the body,

wings closed on this side of a predetermined displacement of 

the jaw, 
a sensor (140) provided to be located above the boot 
sole,
