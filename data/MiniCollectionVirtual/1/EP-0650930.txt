<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an electrolytic cell for the
generation of hypo-halogenites in a continuous process.The electrolysis of halogenites in a liquid medium
producing acid hypo-halogenites or their corresponding
salts has been employed for disinfection treatments of
water in general, especially for water in swimming pools,
cooling towers and reservoirs, including drinking water
and waste water.There are several types of electrolytic cells for this
end, installed as part of a hydraulic system which the
liquid to be treated flows through (on-line electrolytic
chlorinators). The water being treated may contain a
natural residue of a halogen salt, usually sodium
chloride; if necessary, an appropriate amount may be
added. Within the cell are appropriate electrodes that
communicate externally to a continuous current electrical
supply. The electrolysis of the halogen salt occurs on the
surface of the electrodes, and the corresponding halogen
(chlorine, if the halogen salt is sodium chloride;
bromine, if it is sodium bromide, and so on), hydrogen
and, to a lower degree, oxygen, are formed.As there is no separation between the anode and the
cathode, the halogen combines with the medium to form the
corresponding hypo-halogenites. The products of the
electrolysis are taken outside the cell by the flow of
water, and the hypo-halogenites is dissolved. The hydrogen
and the oxygen, not very soluble in the medium, are
expelled to the atmosphere by the exposed surface of the 
liquid. This type of equipment is generally known as
hypochlorite generator, electrolytic chlorinator, salt
water chlorinator or electrolyser.Due to the low salt content dissolved we will occasionally
refer to this solution quite simply as water or
electrolyte, it being understood that it is an
electrolytic solution, that is, water with a certain
amount of salt or salts of one or more halogens. The first
electrolytic cells of the type were built in segments of
commercial plastic pipes with concentric tubular
electrodes or electrodes in fiat parallel grid or solid
plates, attached to their inside, and electrical lead
linking them to an external supply through sealed
openings on the wall of the cell. The cells were installed
in commercially available plastic pipes that are part of
the system of the water to be treated.A problem common to this type of equipment was the
possibility of energizing the cells with the pump switched
off, that is, without any water flowing through the cell.
In this case, the operation of electrolysis can cause an
accumulat
