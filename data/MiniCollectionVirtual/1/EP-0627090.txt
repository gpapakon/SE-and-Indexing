 RETROREFLECTIVE ASSEMBLY AND PROCESS FOR MAKING SAMEField of InventionThe present invention relates to retroreflective assemblies of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,072,403 (Eigenmann) , pavement markings incorporating such assemblies, and methods for making such assemblies.BackgroundPavement markings of various forms (e.g., paints, tapes, and individually mounted articles) are well known to guide and direct motorists as they travel along a highway. During the daytime, the markings, which are typically of selected distinctive color(s) , may be sufficiently visible under ambient light to effectively signal and guide a motorist. At night, however, especially when the primary source of illumination is the motorist's vehicle headlights, the colors of the markings are generally insufficient to adequately guide a motorist. For this reason, pavement markings with retroreflective properties have been employed.U.S. Patent No. 4,072,403 (Eigenmann) discloses a retroreflective assembly useful in pavement marking applications that is particularly useful for situations in which retroreflection is required under raining and/or condensing environmental conditions. The assembly disclosed therein comprises a transparent globule having a first, uncoated part-spherical surface portion positioned to be impinged by light rays, a second substantially flat surface portion opposite the first surface portion, and a third, toroidal surface portion intermediate between the first and second surface portions. The toroidal surface has a radius of curvature considerably smaller than that of the first part-spherical surface portion. A monolayer of transparent microspheres, with a reflective layer therebehind, disposed on the flat portion and at least 

a part of the toroidal surface portion of the globule serves to focus and retroreflect light beams that are incident to the first spherical surface portion of the globule and then pass through the globule to the toroidal or flat surfaces. The microspheres serve to redirect light back through the globule, exiting the upper surface so as to return towards the illumination source. The retroreflective assemblies disclosed in the patent, sometimes referred to as "globule/microsphere retroreflective assemblies", provide effective retroreflection of light at low incidence angles, making them well-suited for horizontal applications such as pavement surfaces. U.S. Patent No. 4,072,403 also discloses a method for production of such assemblies wherein a flat sheet material is passed

Claims :
â€¢1. A retroreflective assembly comprising: a) a transparent globule having a first, uncoated part-spherical surface portion for reception of incident light;.a second, substantially flat surface portion opposite said first surface portion; and a third, toroidal surface portion intermediate said first and second surface portions, said toroidal surface portion having a radius of curvature smaller than the radius of curvature of said first part-spherical surface portion; b) a monolayer of externally reflecting transparent microspheres for focusing and retroreflecting light beams incident upon said first surface portion and which have passed through said globule, said monolayer being applied to at least a part of said toroidal surface portion; and c) a layer of diffuse reflecting pigment disposed behind said monolayer of microspheres.
2. The retroreflective assembly of claim 1 further comprising a space coat interposed between said monolayer of microspheres and said layer of diffuse reflecting pigment.
3. The retroreflective assembly of claim 1 cheracterized in that said diffuse reflecting pigment layer comprises one or more of the following: latex, fluorescent material, urethane, titanium dioxide, magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, and pearlescent pigment.
4. The retroreflective assembly of claim 1 characterized in that said transparent globule includes at least one of the following: a) a light-absorbing dye; or b) an acrylic globule including a dye. 


 5.. An array comprising a plurality of the retroreflective assemblies of claim 1.
6. A pavement marking sheet comprising: a) a urethane matrix top coat containing diffuse reflecting pigment; and b) a retroreflective assembly embedded in the top coat, the retroreflective assembly comprising: 1) a transparent globule having a first, uncoated part-spherical surface portion for reception of incident light; a second, substantially flat surface portion opposite the first surface portion; and a third, toroidal surface portion intermediate said first and second surface portions, said toroidal surface portion having a radius of curvature smaller than the radius of curvature of the first, part-spherical surface portion; and 2) a monolayer of externally reflecting transparent microspheres for focusing and retroreflecting light beams incident upon said first surface portion and which have passed through said globule, said monolayer being applied at least to a part of said toroidal surface portion.
7. The pavement marking sheet of claim 12 characterized in that said embedded retroreflective assembly further includes a layer of diffuse reflecting pigment superimposed on the monolayer of microspheres.
8. A method of preparing a retroreflective assembly, said method comprising the steps of: a) providing a web of transparent globules, said globules having a first spherical surface portion protruding from a first side of the web and a second substantially flat surface portion and a toroidal surface portion projecting from a second 


 side of the web, the toroidal surface portion having a radius of curvature generally smaller than the radius of curvature of the first part- spherical portion, and the toroidal surface portion bearing a monolayer of externally reflecting transparent microspheres for focusing and retroreflective light beams incident upon the first surface portion and which have passed through the globule; and b) applying a layer of diffuse reflecting pigment over said monolayer of microspheres.
9. The method of claim 8 further comprising the step of applying a space coat upon said monolayer of microspheres prior to the step of applying said diffuse reflecting pigment.
10. The method of claim 8 characterized in that said diffuse reflecting pigment is applied in a liquid carrier which optionally comprises latex or urethane.
11. The method of claim 8 characterized in that said pigment comprises at least one of the following: titanium dioxide and fluorescent pigment.
