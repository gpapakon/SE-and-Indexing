<ABSTRACT>
A mould-closing unit for a plastics injection-moulding machine has a hydraulic pressure cylinder with a high-pressure space (H) and a low-pressure space (N), which can be connected to each other via an overflow channel (42), a hydraulic drive cylinder/piston unit, to which hydraulic medium can be admitted via the lines, and also a valve for opening and closing the overflow channel (42), which valve can be transferred into and out of the shut-off position from cylinder spaces to which the said hydraulic medium can be admitted. The fact that the drive cylinder/piston unit or the line supplying the drive cylinder/piston unit with hydraulic medium is in open connection with the cylinder space (25) effecting the opening of the valve achieves the effect that an optimum opening of the overflow channel is possible in an uncomplex manner.
