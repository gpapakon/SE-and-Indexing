<ABSTRACT>
An electrically driveable liquid pump (1) has a pump casing (2) which is provided with an intake port (3) and an outlet port (4) and in which there is arranged a pump chamber (5) which is connected to the intake and outlet port, extends in part between field-generating elements (6) arranged in the pump casing (2) and in which a rotor (7) of an electric motor is supported, coupled to an impeller (8), on a journal (9). In a circular opening (11) of the pump casing (2), a closure element (12) is arranged rotatably, which forms a wall of the pump chamber (5). The pump is to be designed in such a way that it runs reliably even under difficult operating conditions. To this end, the shaft (9) carrying the rotor (7) of the electric motor and the pump impeller (8) coupled thereto is supported in such a way in the closure element (12) that, when the closure element (12) is moved out of the circular opening (11) of the pump casing (2), the rotor (7), the impeller (8), the shaft (9) and the closure element (12) carrying these elements form a coherent unit. Owing to the shaft being mounted in the closure element, separate handling of the shaft is unnecessary, and cleaning and service operations can be carried out quickly even by lay (unskilled) personnel.
