<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for recording the information in which a laser beam of low coherence and high output radiated from a semiconductor laser (21) having a wide radiating area is illuminated on a sound track (25b) of a cinefilm (25) after light modulation by a light modulator (23) in accordance with the electro-optical effect. The light modulator (23) is provided within a depth of focus of the laser beam which has its focal point intermediate between the light modulator (23) and an image-forming lens (24). The recording time for recording the voice data may be shortened by employing the laser beam, while the speckled noise may be inhibited and the image-forming performance may be improved by adjusting the focal point of the laser beam as described above. Besides, since the laser beam is a low-coherence light, there is no necessity of providing a polarizing plate, so that the number of components may be diminished to simplify the construction to lower production costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for
recording the information which may be conveniently employed for
recording the voice information on a cinefilm by optically
recording the voice information on a sound track of the cinefilm,
for optically recording the desired information on an optical
card, or thermally recording so-called bar codes as the recording
information by light on a heat-sensitive recording medium. More
particularly, it relates to a method and an apparatus for
optically recording or photo-thermally recording the desired
information by a laser beam radiated by laser beam radiating
means.Heretofore, the voice information for cinema for a movie
theater is recorded on the sound track provided on a right or
left edge of a picture area of the cinefilm along the film
running direction.If a light source other than a laser source, such as an LED
array or a halogen lamp, is employed, an output is low and
sufficient luminosity cannot be achieved, while a lot of time is 
consumed in recording the information. However, if the usual
laser beam is employed, a speckled noise is produced in an
ultimate image thus seriously deteriorating the image-forming
performance. The information concerning the speckled noise may
be found in "Introduction to Fourier Optics", pages 131 to 134,
by Joseph W. Goodman, McGrow-Hill Book Company, 1968. On the
other hand, with the coherent laser beam, the cut-off of the
resolution for the spatial frequency is also reduced by one half.
Consequently, a light source other than the laser light has so
far been employed in the optical recording system. However, if
the light source employed is of the type in which a spatial
modulator is based on the polarized light produced under e.g. the
electro-optical effect, it is necessary to provide polarizing
plates ahead and at the back of the modulator, which detracts
from the efficiency since the system is used in conjunction with
a non-polarized light.Such conventional method for recording information on a
recording medium such as a cine film is for example described
in US-A-4,600,280. The audio information is recorded in a
digital form using an A/D-converter and an optical modulator
and scanner means on the sound track of the cine film. As
light source a conventional lamp as a halogen lamp or the
like is employed. Meanwhile, for recording the information without voids, such
as by a printer, the conventional practice has been to employ an
two staggered arrays of modulators. If a light source of a lower
light output is
