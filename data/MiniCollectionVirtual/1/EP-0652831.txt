<ABSTRACT>
Flight time of a stream of ink drops is measured and compared against a set point to determine variations therefrom. Variations due to changes in the ink composition are compensated by adding or withholding solvent in proportion to the detected change. Changes due to variations in nozzle drive voltage result in the computation and use of a new flight time set point value to avoid erroneous corrective action.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink jet printers and to methods of operating ink jet 
printers. More specifically, it relates to ink jet printers having a time of flight based 
control system in which ink drops issuing from the print head are monitored to detect 
changes in flight time due to various causes. In ink jet printers it is known that changes in ink composition occur over time 
and, if not compensated, will result in a deterioration of print quality or shut down of 
the printer. For this reason, it is common practice to monitor the ink in such systems. 
In continuous jet printers, ink is recirculated until it is printed onto a substrate. 
Because the ink contains volatile substances, such as solvents, it will thicken over 
time as these evaporate resulting in changes in ink composition. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,555,712, and 4,827,280 teach that the flow rate of ink from 
the ink supply system to the nozzle should be monitored. This is achieved by passing 
the ink through a small cylindrical tank provided with float switches. The time required 
for the ink level to drop from a first point to a second point is monitored and changes 
in this time are indicative of changes in ink composition. Detected changes in ink 
composition are compensated in any of several ways including changing the ink 
temperature, changing the pressure applied to the ink, and adding or withholding 
solvent. For example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,555,712, solvent is either added in a 
predetermined quality or withheld. In U.S. Patent No. 4,827,280, a valve is operated  
 
to add solvent for a period proportional to the error in flow time, that is a servo control. Flow rate control works generally satisfactorily but is accompanied by various 
disadvantages including errors and uncertainties due to the inaccuracy of the float 
switches, and the need for a separate measurement tank. It is generally known from the prior art for an ink jet printer to be provided with 
means for supplying ink to a nozzle under pressure for projection as an ink stream 
towards a surface to be marked, means for applying a stimulation voltage to the 
nozzle to cause the ink stream to break-up into discrete ink drops, means for 
electrically charging selected ink drops to control their deflection, and printer control 
means including time measuring means for measuring the time of flight of selected 
charged ink drops for various purposes. For example U.S. Patent No. 4,217,594 
teaches that ink drop velocity should be controlled as a function of temperature 
variatio

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet printer including means for supplying ink to a nozzle (20) under pressure 
for projection as an ink stream towards a surface to be marked, means for applying a 

stimulation voltage to the nozzle to cause the ink stream to break-up into discrete ink 
drops, means (24) for electrically charging selected ink drops to control their deflection and 

printer control means including time measuring means (28, 30) for measuring the time of flight 
of selected charged ink drops, characterised in that the printer control means includes 

means (103) responsive to the time measuring means (102) for periodically comparing 
the measured flight time of a charged ink drop against a reference value, and means 

(104) responsive to detection of a variation in flight time from the reference value for 
altering the viscosity of the ink by an amount related to the variation in flight time. 
An ink jet printer, as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the time measuring 
means (102) includes first and second electrodes (28, 30) disposed at different points 

along the flight path (25) of the ink drops for detecting charges thereon and for 
measuring the elapsed time between detection of a charged ink drop by each electrode. 
An ink jet printer, as in Claim 2 and in which the printer includes a catcher (26) 
for receiving uncharged or weakly charged drops, characterised in that the second 

electrode (30) is associated with the ink catcher (26).  
 
An ink jet printer, as in Claim 2 or 3 and in which the means for electrically 
charging selected ink drops is a charge tunnel, characterised in that the first electrode 

(28) is associated with the charge tunnel (24) to measure the elapsed time between 
a weakly charged ink drop leaving the charge tunnel (24) and being detected by the 

second electrode (30) as the time of flight measurement, and the printer control means 
also includes means (122,124) for altering the reference value if there has been a 

change in stimulation voltage amplitude, whereby differences in flight time due to 
changes in stimulation voltage will be compensated to prevent erroneous adjustments 

in ink viscosity. 
A method of operating an ink jet printer including projecting a stream of discrete 
ink drops towards a surface to be marked, electrically charging selected ink drops to 

control their deflection, and measuring the flight time of the selected charged ink 

drops, characterised by periodically comparing the measured flight time with a 
reference value, and altering the viscosity of the ink responsive to detection of a 

variation in flight time from the reference value by an amount related to the variation 
in flight time. 
The method, as in Claim 5, characterised by measuring the flight time of 
selected charged ink drops between a means for electrically charging the drops and 

a catcher intended to receive uncharged or weakly charged drops, detecting changes 
in a stimulation voltage amplitude for generating the stream of ink drops, and 

appropriately altering the reference value used for future comparisons if a variation in  
 

flight time is detected and there has been a change in the stimulation voltage 
amplitude. 
The method, as in Claim 6, characterised by altering the reference value by 
appropriately adding or subtracting the magnitude of the detected variation thereto.
