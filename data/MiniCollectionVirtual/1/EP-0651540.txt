<ABSTRACT>
A telephone subscriber circuit coupled to the terminals of 
a telephone line including a single galvanic isolation 

element (F), having an input terminal connected to circuit 
means (DZ1,DZ2,DZ3,Q1) of transferring call signals, 

connected between two terminals (TIP,RING) of a telephone 
subscriber line, and to an output terminal of a speech 

circuit coupled to such terminals through a diode bridge 
circuit (D) and a switch (I). 
The galvanic isolation element has an output termination 
for connection to subscriber apparatus not powered from the 

telephone line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone subscriber circuits,
specifically circuits which enable subscriber apparatus
utilizing the signals transmitted over a telephone line but
drawing no power from the latter, to be coupled to said
line.Such equipment as telephone answering systems or computer
terminals used in lieu of traditional phone sets require,
for proper handling of all the information received through
the telephone line signals, to be fully uncoupled
electrically from the line.The uncoupling is usually ensured by transformers or
photocoupling devices, i.e. elements which can transfer
signals transmitted through the line while maintaining
galvanic isolation.Two discrete elements are currently employed for
transmitting, to subscriber apparatus which are not powered
from the telephone line, the ring signals in a hook-off
condition of the line and the other receive signals, such
as voice signals, in a hook-on condition of the line.Also, a transformer element and a photocoupler element may
be used together where design requirements make this
advisable.An apparatus for automatically connecting terminal devices to telephone lines is described in US Patent 5 151 972.The underlying technical problem of this invention is to
reduce the number of the components required in a telephone
subscriber circuit for extracting the signals transmitted
over a telephone line at the subscriber call and
acknowledgment stages, and to utilize them in subscriber
apparatus not powered through the telephone line, by
omitting one of the two galvanic isolation elements
employed heretofore. This reduction in the number of components is desirable to
bring down cost and the occupation of integration area
while improving reliability.This technical problem is solved by a telephone subscriber
circuit as outlined above and defined in the characterizing
parts of the appended claims to this specification.The features and advantages of a telephone subscriber
circuit according to the invention will be apparent from
the following description of an embodiment thereof, given
by way of example and not of limitation with reference to
the accompanying drawing.The single Figure of the drawing shows a diagram, partly in
block form, of a telephone subscriber circuit according to
the invention which includes a single galvanic isolation
element.The circuit diagram shown in the drawing comprises a speech
circuit for transmitting and receiving voice signals, as
indicated by a block SPEECH CIRCUIT, which may be a
conventional type and is coupled to the
