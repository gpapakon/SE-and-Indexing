<ABSTRACT>
A console assembly for use in an automotive vehicle 
body passenger compartment is disclosed. The assembly 

includes a housing member (24) interposed between a pair of 
seats (12,14) in the vehicle, an armrest member (38) and a 

bottom member (48) pivotally secured to the housing 
member (24). The armrest member (38) and bottom member (48) 

pivot from a first position defining an auxiliary seat to a 
second position defining a console assembly in the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a console 
for use in automotive vehicle front seating arrangements. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
console which is selectively convertible between a console 
assembly and an auxiliary passenger seat disposed between 
the driver and primary passenger seats of the vehicle. It is well known in the automobile body arts to provide 
for the mounting of trays or other receptacles in the 
passenger compartment of an automobile to permit relatively 
stable support of items of food and drink and other small 
articles. Such trays are typically mounted to a floor 
console such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,453,759, assigned 
to the assignee of the present invention. Although such 
console provides for the storage of articles, the console 
interrupts the continuity of the front seat resulting in the 
driver seat being spaced apart and remote from the primary 
passenger seat. To provide for a second or auxiliary 
passenger front seat, a continuous bench-type seat extending 
across the entire width of the vehicle or a split-type seat 
wherein the two passenger seat portions form one continuous 
portion of the split seat arrangement have been utilized. 
However, in both of these seating arrangements, it is not 
possible to provide for a functional console such as 
described above. EP-A-0 438 858 proposes a console assembly including an internal storage 
compartment, a girth support means rotatably connected to the front part 
thereof, and an upper lid serving as an armrest member when closing 
said compartment.  
 U.S. Patent No. 4,685,729 proposes a console assembly 
which is convertible between a compartmentalized console 
extending from the front seat toward the vehicle dashboard 
and a second passenger seat position between the driver seat 
and the primary passenger seat. The console of the '729 
patent utilizes a reversible motor driven lead screw 
attached to a track associated with the console frame which 
selectively extends and retracks the console frame relative 
to the seating frame to provide a console. In this manner, 
an auxiliary or second passenger seat is provided while 
still providing for a console assembly. However, the use of 
a motor driven console assembly often increases the cost of  
 
the console assembly, the weight of the assembly, and 
decreases the operating efficiency of the system. 
Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a selectively 
convertible console assembly/auxiliary passenger seat 
combination which

<CLAIMS>
A console assembly for use in an automotive vehicle 
body passenger compartment having a floor (16) for mounting 

a pair of seats (12,14) in laterally spaced relationship 
about a vertical plane through the longitudinal axis of the 

vehicle body, each of said seats having a seat cushion (18) 
and a seat back (20) in generally orthogonal relationship, 

said console assembly comprising: 

a housing member (24) interposed between said pair 
of seats (12,14) and including a pair of upwardly projecting 

rear pillars (34) at a rear end thereof and a pair of 
upwardly projecting front pillars (30) at a front end 

thereof and defining an internal storage cavity (36) thereby; 
an armrest member (38) pivotably secured to said 
rear pillars (34) and operative to pivot from a first 

generally vertical position contiguous with and 
complementary to the seat backs to a second generally 

horizontal position over said housing member (24); and 
a bottom member (48) pivotably secured to said 
front pillars (30) and operative to pivot from a first 

generally horizontal position covering said housing 
member (24) and being contiguous with and complementary to 

said seat cushions (18) to a second position longitudinally 
forward of said console assembly (22) to expose said 

internal storage cavity (36) of said housing member (24) 
whereby, when said armrest member (38) and said bottom 

member (48) are in the first positions said console assembly 
defines an auxiliary passenger seat interposed between said 

pair of seats (12,14). 
A console assembly according to Claim 1, further 
including mounting means for mounting said console assembly 

to the floor in an axially extending space defined between 
said seats.  

 
A console assembly according to Claim 1, wherein 
said housing member comprises a generally rectangular frame 

having a pair of side walls disposed generally parallel to 
the longitudinal axis of said vehicle and a front and rear 

transverse wall disposed generally perpendicular to said 
side walls. 
A console assembly according to Claim 3, wherein 
said front and rear pillars are formed on said front and rear 

transverse walls, respectively. 
A console assembly according to Claim 1, wherein 
said armrest member includes a first surface and a second 

surface, said first surface having a cushioned exterior and 
being contiguous and complementary to said seat backs when 

said armrest member is in said first position. 
A console assembly according to Claim 1, wherein 
said armrest member further includes hinge means for 

engaging said rear pillars, said hinge means being 
operative to lock said armrest member in said first and 

second positions. 
A console assembly according to Claim 6, wherein 
said hinge means comprises an elongate rod journaled 

through said armrest member and operative to rotatably 
engage said each of said rear pillars. 
A console assembly according to Claim 1, wherein 
said bottom member further includes hinge means for engaging 

said front pillars, said hinge means being operative to lock 
said bottom member in said first and second positions. 
A console assembly according to claims 6, wherein 
said hinge means comprises an elongated rod journaled 

through said bottom member and operative to rotatable engage 
said each of said front pillars.  

 
A console assembly according to Claim 1, wherein 
said bottom member further includes a top surface and a 

bottom surface, said top surface having a cushioned exterior 
and being contiguous with and complementary to said seat 

cushions when in said first position, said bottom surface 
including an article receiving tray formed therein.
