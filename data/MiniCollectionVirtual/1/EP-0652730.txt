<ABSTRACT>
A surgical device having a longitudinal configuration and an axis extending between a proximal end and an opposing distal end includes a housing having an inner surface defining a chamber and a cannula extending distally of the housing. A valve disposed in the housing has a conical outer wall and a plurality of distal walls which form a first seal with the inner surface of the housing and a second seal. The walls include multiple fold segments which are foldable between a first position wherein the second seal closes the cannula and a second position wherein the second seal opens the cannula. A method for actuating the valve includes the step of inserting an instrument distally into the valve to contact the fold segments along a line and to move the fold segments to the second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical
valves.Access devices are commonly used in surgery to
facilitate the introduction of various surgical
instruments into vessels, conduits, cavities, and other
interior regions of the body. These access devices
include, for example, devices which facilitate
introduction of a needle into a vessel, and trocars which
facilitate the introduction of laparoscopic instruments
into the abdomen of the body.Some of these access devices are introduced into
regions which include a fluid under pressure. In the case
of a needle access device, this fluid may be a liquid such 
as blood. In the case of a trocar, this fluid may be a gas
such as an insufflation gas. In either case it is
desirable to provide for the introduction of the surgical
instrument into the cavity without permitting the escape of
the pressurized fluid.Seal mechanisms are usually employed in an access
device to prevent this escape of fluid. Such mechanisms
have typically included an aperture or septum valve which
has functioned satisfactorily to form a seal around the
outer surface of an instrument positioned within the access
device. However, when this instrument has been removed,
such aperture or septum valves have been relatively
ineffective in providing a complete closure or zero closure
to prevent the escape of pressurized fluid. For this
reason, a zero closure valve has typically been included in
the seal mechanism. While zero closure valves are
typically not relied on to seal with an instrument in
place, they nevertheless are expected to provide an
effective closure when the instrument is removed.In the past, zero closure valves have included flapper
valves which permit the instrument to pass through the
valve, but which are automatically biased to a closed
position when the instrument is removed. One problem with
the flapper valve is its complexity which generally equates
to expensive and difficult manufacturing processes. An
example of the flapper valve is disclosed by Moll et al. in
U. S. Patent No. 4,654,030.Another type of zero closure valve is commonly
referred to as a "duck bill" valve. This particular
mechanism can form an effective zero closure, but it
suffers from high friction forces which tend to inhibit
insertion and removal of the instrument. The duck bill 
mechanism also tends to invert when the instrument is
removed. An example of the "duck bill" valve is disclosed
by Edwards, et al in US Patent No. 4,566,493.US Patent Specification No. 4,492,253 discloses
a tide gate check valve in which

<CLAIMS>
A valve (32) having an axis (41) extending
between a proximal end (45) and an opposing distal end

(43), comprising:

an outer wall (50) forming a continuous outer
surface (52) around the axis (41);
a flange (56) extending radially outwardly at a
proximal end (45) of the outer wall (50);
a plurality of fold sections (61a, 61b, 61c, 61d)
extending inwardly of the outer wall (50), and forming a

continuous inner surface (54) of the valve, each of the
fold sections (61a, 61b, 61c, 61d) having an open state and a

closed state;
a first one of the fold sections (61a) having a
generally concave distal facing surface and a generally

convex proximal facing surface;
a second one of the fold sections (61b) disposed
in juxtaposition to the first fold section (61a) and

defining with the first fold section (61a) a slit (103)
which is sealed when the fold sections (61a, 61b, 61c, 61d) are in

the closed state and is unsealed when the fold sections
(61a, 61b, 61c, 61d) are in the open state;

characterised in that the continuous inner
surface (54) of the valve (32) when the fold sections (61a, 61b, 61c, 61d)

are in the closed state only makes contact with
itself at the distal end face of the valve, whereby when

an elongate instrument (28) is displaced along the axis
from the proximal towards the distal end it opens the

valve by contacting the inner wall along inner fold lines
(85a, 85b, 85c, 85d) of the fold sections (61a, 61b, 61c, 61d) thereby

limiting friction between the instrument (28) and the
valve (32).
A valve according to Claim 1, characterised in
that


each of the fold sections (61a, 61b, 61c, 61d) include a 
first wall (63) and a second wall (65); and

second fold section (61b).
