<ABSTRACT>
The heat-storage unit proposed has an inner container (10), designed to hold the heat-storage medium (4), plus an outer container (9) which surrounds the inner container, leaving a gap between them. The rims of the two containers are joined hermetically to each other. A heat-insulating cover (12), through which a heating element (5) passes, seals off the mouth of the double-walled container. The space (6) between the inner and outer containers is evacuated and connected to a getter device (8). When the getter device (8) is heated, gas flows into the space (6) between the two container walls, filling it with increasing pressure so that heat transfer takes place increasingly from the inner container (10) to the outer container (9). A radiation shield (15) disposed in the space (6) between the two container walls prevents radiant heat from passing from the inner container to the outer container.
