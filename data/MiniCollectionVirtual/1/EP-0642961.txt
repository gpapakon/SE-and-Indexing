<ABSTRACT>
A valve protection assembly for a twin-circuit pneumatic 
braking system includes a flow-dividing valve (52) with an 

inlet (54) connected to the inlet connector (1) of the 
valve assembly and two outlets (56, 58) connected to 

first and second outlet connectors (21, 22) respectively 
of the valve assembly. The flow-dividing valve (52) is 

provided to divide the flow entering it into two outlet 
flows which are at a substantially constant, 

predetermined ratio to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve assembly for 
protecting a twin-circuit pneumatic braking system, of 
the type commonly known as a reservoir-protection valve 
assembly. More specifically, the invention relates to a valve 
protection assembly which includes: 
an inlet connector for connection to a compressed air 
supply, first and second outlet connectors, for connection to 
respective pressure reservoirs of the first and second 
braking circuits, third and fourth outlet connectors, for connection to 
a parking brake system and to auxiliary pneumatic 
apparatus respectively, first and second on-off valves, both normally 
closed, interposed between the inlet connector and the 
first and second outlet connectors respectively, and third and fourth on-off valves, both normally closed, 
having their outlets connected to the third and fourth 
outlet connectors respectively. Valve protection assemblies of the type described above 
have been known for a long time and have been improved over 
the years so as to conform to ever more demanding safety  
 
standards. Currently, the main safety provisions with which valve 
reservoir-protection assemblies must comply are the 
following: 
a) in the event of failure of one of the circuits 
connected to its outlet connectors, the valve assembly 
must ensure that compressed air is supplied to the 
remaining circuits, despite the failure, b) with an intact system, starting from a condition in 
which all the reservoirs are unpressurised, the valve 
assembly must be able to fill the reservoirs that supply 
the front and rear braking sections (main reservoirs) 
before filling the reservoir which supplies the parking 
brake system, c) in the event of failure of one main braking section, 
the valve protection assembly must ensure that the 
reservoir which supplies the intact main section is 
filled despite the failure. Figure 6 of the appended drawings is a schematic diagram 
illustrating a prior-art valve reservoir protection 
assembly, of the most advanced generation of such 
assemblies. It includes an inlet connector 1 for 
connection to a compressed air supply. The inlet 
connector 1 is connected to four, normally-closed, on-off 
valves indicated V1-V4. The outlets of the valves V1-V4 
are connected to respective outlet connectors indicated  
 
21, 22, 23 and 24. Two by-passes, are provided between 
the inlet connector 1 and the outlet connectors 21 and 22 
(intended to be connected to the supply reservoirs of the 
main braking circuits), and are arranged in

closed, having their respective outlets connected to the 

third and fourth outlet connectors (23, 24) respectively, 
characterised in that it includes a flow-dividing valve 

(52) with an inlet (54) connected to the inlet connector 
and two outlets (56, 58) connected to the first and the 

second outlet connectors (21, 22) respectively, the flow-dividing 
valve (52) being intended to divide the air flow 

entering it into two outlet flows in a predetermined and 
substantially constant ratio to each other. 
A valve assembly according to Claim 1, 
 

characterised in that it includes two non-return valves 
(60) associated with respective outlets (56, 58) of the 

flow-dividing valve (52) and arranged so as to allow air 
to flow from the inlet connector (1) towards the outlet 

connectors (21, 22). 
A valve assembly according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the flow-dividing valve (52) 

includes a cylindrical cavity (62) communicating at both 
ends with the inlet connector (1) through respective 

calibrated narrowed passages (64, 68) and housing a 
piston (70) operable to divide the flow between two 

outlet ducts (74, 76) communicating with the peripheral 
wall of the cylindrical cavity (62). 
A valve assembly according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the piston (70) of the flow-dividing 

valve (52) includes a rigid body in which two valve 
members (82) are slidable and resiliently urged towards 

respective valve seats defining the openings to the 
calibrated narrowed passages (64, 68). 
A valve assembly according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the piston (70) of the flow-dividing 

valve (52) includes a member (86) which is resiliently 
deformable by the air pressure and provided with integral 

valve members (96) urged towards a configuration closing
