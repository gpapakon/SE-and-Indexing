<ABSTRACT>
A plug member (10) of a buckle has a pair of engaging 
legs (14, 14) receivable in a socket member (20) to 

couple the plug member (20) and the socket member (20). The 
engaging legs (14, 14) are curved inwardly toward each other 

and each has an elongated opening (17) extending 
longitudinally thereof and extending across its thickness. 

The socket member (20) includes an upper plate (20a) and a 
lower plate (20b) defining therebetween a guide chamber (24) 

and interconnected by a central guide wall (23). The socket 
member (20) includes a pair of retaining portions (26, 26) 

disposed in the guide chamber (24) for interlocking engagement 
with a pair of locking portions (16) formed at the leading 

ends of the respective engaging legs (14, 14). Each of the 
engaging legs (14, 14) has a recessed thin guide portion (11) 

which is smaller in thickness than an operating portion (18) 
of each engaging leg (14). The buckle thus constructed is 

relatively small in thickness, can be coupled and uncoupled 
reliably and smoothly with a relatively small force, and is 

able to withstand undue force or pressure tending to damage 
the buckle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a buckle according to the preamble of claim 1.With a known buckle of this kind (GB 2 262 962 A) relatively strong forces are
necessary when the outer operating portions extending through the slots of the socket
member are depressed inwardly for disengaging the locking portions from the retaining
portions, because of the high thickness of the engaging legs and their low flexibility resulting
therefrom.It is therefore the object of the invention to modify the known buckle in such a way
that the forces for operating the engaging legs when depressing them inwardly for
disengaging the locking portions from the retaining portions are reduced without impairing
the coupling strength, namely the strength and the stability of the buckle during its operation
as well as in its closed condition.According to the present invention, the buckle is characterized by the characterizing
features of claim 1. Because of the elongated openings of the engaging legs extending longitudinally of
said legs and also through the thickness of the leg and because of the arcuately inward
curvature of the legs so that their leading ends converge toward each other with the inner
peripheral walls and each of said opening being curved arcuately inwardly, the engaging
legs are made of comparatively less material as compared with the above-mentioned prior
art buckle without losing its stability in spite of its higher flexibility. In addition with the
claimed location of the abutment portions at the leading ends of the engaging legs, the plug
and the socket in engagement do not wobble nor play not only in the direction of insertion of
the plug but also in the direction perpendicular to said direction, thus stabilizing the
engagement.It is to be noted that with a known buckle of a different kind (EP 0 204 250 A1, Fig.
13, 14) the outer operating portions are formed as flat fingers which are pivotably mounted,
namely molded in one piece with the socket member close to its end opening
communicating with the guide chamber and their free ends being in contact with the outer
side of the engaging legs of the plug member. Thus, for disengaging the locking portions
from the retaining portions, it is necessary to depress the finger-like outer operating portions
of the socket member which swivel around the swivel axis through the place of their
mounting and in turn bend inwardly themselves and also the engaging legs which are in
frictional contact with them toward each other. A buckle of this construction is rather
complicated,

<CLAIMS>
A buckle including a plug member (10) and a socket member (20) which are
releasably engageable with each other; said plug member (10) including a base (12) and a

pair of resiliently deflectable engaging legs (14, 14) projecting from said base (12) and
being symmetrical with each other about a central axis of said plug member and receivable

in said socket member (20) having a guide chamber (24) for receptive engagement with the
engaging legs (14, 14), with an end opening communicating with said chamber, said engaging legs and said socket member having

locking respectively retaining portions (16, 26) disposed on upper and lower surfaces
respectively upper and lower plates, each of the engaging legs (14, 14) has an operating

portion (18) which, as the leg is received in the socket member, extends through a
corresponding slot (21) of the socket member into an exposed position allowing to be

depressed inwardly for disengaging the corresponding locking portion (16) of the leg from
the corresponding retaining portion of the socket member, said locking portions (16) of the

engaging legs being provided with abutment portions (30) engageable with an inner side
surface of corresponding one of the retaining portions (26, 26) disposed in the guide

chamber of the socket member, said buckle being 
characterized in that
a) each of the engaging legs (14, 14) has an elongated opening (17) extending
longitudinally of said leg (14) and also through the thickness of the leg (14)
b) the legs are curved arcuately inwardly from their base ends to their leading ends (i.e.
along their entire length) so that the leading ends converge toward each other, with

the inner peripheral walls (14a, 14a) and each of said opening (17) being curved
arcuately inwardly
c) the abutment portions (30) are located at the leading ends of the engaging legs.
A buckle according to claim 1, wherein said socket member (20) has a pair of slits
(27, 27) extending continuously from said slots (21, 21), respectively, in the direction of

insertion of said plug member (10), and having a width smaller than that of said slots (21,
21), each of said engaging legs (14, 14) having a thin guide portion (11a) receivable in a

corresponding one of said slits (27, 27), and an operating portion (18) extending along an
outer edge of said engaging leg (14) and having a thickness larger than that of said thin

guide portion (11a), said operating portion being always disposed outside said socket
member (20) during insertion and detachment of said plug member (10) relative to said

socket member (20).
A buckle according to claim 2, wherein said engaging leg (14) has a stopper portion
(18a) formed as a step between said thin guide portion (11a) and said operating portion (18)

and engageable with one of opposite sides of said socket member (20) to limit inward
movement of said engaging leg (14).
