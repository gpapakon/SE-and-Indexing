<ABSTRACT>
The device for measuring the dielectric and magnetic characteristics of materials is comprised of two coaxial lines (2, 4) having each a central core (18) and a peripheral wall (20) which are coaxial and conducting, one extremity of the wall presenting a planar surface in contact with a material (16), a region defined between the core and the wall being filled with a homogenous dielectric (26), said region extending from said extremity so that the propagation in each line takes place according to the TEM mode, and a measuring apparatus (6) which is connected to the lines and energizes one of said lines, detects the signals reflected and transmitted at the input and at the output of the lines arranged on either side of the material and thus provides for the determination of the desired characteristics. Application to materials for hyperfrequency components.
