<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a stopper for use with containers to provide needleless access to the container with a cannula having a blunt penetrating tip. Also disclosed is a system comprising the stopper, container and cannula. The stopper includes a disc (29) having an upper face (31) and a lower face (33), and a plug (27) extending from the disc into the container. Also included is a diaphragm (37), defined by a target region in the upper face and a cross channel (41) in the disc for controlling the force needed to penetrate the stopper with the cannula. The plug includes a first inward surface (43) for guiding the cannula and a second inward suface (45) for engaging the cannula to minimize wetting of the outside of the cannula. In a preferred embodiment, the first surface (43) extends down from the cross channel (41) on the lower side of the disc, radially outwardly to a maximum diameter and the second inwardly facing surface (45) extends down from the first surface radially inwardly to a minimum diameter to form the cannula seal. Also shown is a centrally located piercing point positioned to pre-slit the diaphragm. An overcap may be provided to alternatively have an axially aligned boss and bore positioned to pre-slit the diaphragm. In another embodiment, the invention includes an annular pre-slit disc (59) formed of self sealing material and positioned to reduce spray back when inserting or removing the cannula.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NEEDLELESS ACCESS STOPPERen' TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a needlelesε access stopper, and more particularly to an assembly in which medicaments are transferred utilizing blunt tipped cannula in an environment where the medicaments are non-invasive and where the withdrawing system is not used for injecting the medicament directly into the patient via intravenous injections, but would be used to administered medicament through additive sites connections on an IV administration system. 
BACKGROUND ARTIt is well known that medicaments are provided in sealed containers such as glass vials, often with a rubber stopper or seal which can be penetrated with a syringe and needle assembly to obtain access to the contents. There are many instances when the medicaments are withdrawn from the vial or other container and are then directly injected into the patient. Some injections are given intravenously directly while other are given subcutaneously or intramuscularly. In each case, the injection is given with a sharp, pointed needle which is designed to penetrate into the patient with as little stress and discomfort as possible.Of course, this is not the only method for providing and dispensing medicaments. Bottles and caps are used for dispensing pills, powders and the like. However, often times the medicament is injected into the patient by a means which is already invasive such as conventional IV systems where fluids are drained into an apparatus which includes a needle which has already been inserted into the patient.Blood, plasma, glucose and other fluids are conventionally given to patients in this manner. The bag of fluid being administered is connected to the system which has already been connected to the patient. Also heparin locks are uniformly used on patients in hospitals and heparin or saline solutions are injected into the heparin lock on a regular basis. 

 Oftentimes, it is desirable to add specified medicaments to IV systems and other patient treating systems such as catheter type implants. This is done by withdrawing the medicament from the container in which it is supplied, followed by transfer to the system. Most often, syringes are also used to withdraw the medicament even though syringes are not the most easy devices to safely and successfully transfer fluids from one sealed container to a system for use. Of primary concern, of course, is loss of fluid from leakage or spillage from the needle. Another concern is that the medical professional using the syringe and needle will

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A stopper device for use with containers to provide needleless access to said container with a cannula having a blunt stopper penetrating tip, comprising: a disc portion having an upper face and a lower face; a centrally located diaphragm having a predetermined thickness for controlling the force needed to penetrate said stopper with said tip of said cannula, said diaphragm being defined by a target region and a cross channel in said disc; and a plug portion extending from said disc portion into said container, said plug portion having a first inwardly facing surface for guiding said cannula and a second inwardly facing surface defining a cannula embracing seal for engaging said cannula at its stopper penetrating tip to minimize wetting of the outside of said cannula. 


2. The device of claim 1, wherein said first inwardly facing surface extends down from said disc radially outwardly to a maximum diameter said second inwardly facing surface extends down from said first surface radially inwardly to a minimum diameter to form said cannula embracing seal.
3. The device of claim 2, wherein said cross channel has a slit-shaped cross section.
4. The device of claim 2, wherein said cross channel has an X-shaped cross section.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein said upper face is configured to guide and center said cannula tip axially above said cross channel.
6. The device of claim 1, wherein said stopper further includes an overcap having a centrally located axially extending piercing point positioned to pre-slit said diaphragm while sealing said stopper.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein said stopper further includes an overcap having a centrally located axially aligned boss having an axially extending bore and piercer
