<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catheter (1) comprising a tube-like 
basic body (2) with a distal end (4) and a proximal end provided with 

a connecting piece (12) and with a flexible part at the distal 
end. The wall of the flexible end-section comprises an 

elongated heating element (6) extending in the longitudinal 
direction of the catheter (1) wherein at least one excitation 

conductor (7) for the heating element (6) extends from the element (6) 
to close to the proximal end.

 
The heating element (6) is preferably an element which can be 

exited by high frequency electromagnetic oscillations and 
wherein the excitation conductor is an electric conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catheter designed to be 
advanced in the usual manner via the vascular system of the 
patient into his heart for the purpose of investigation or 
treatment. The catheter according to the invention comprises 
a tube-like basic body with a distal end and a proximal end 
provided with a connecting piece and with a flexible part at 
the distal end, wherein the wall of the flexible end-section 
comprises an elongated heating element extending in the 
longitudinal direction of the catheter and wherein at least 
one excitation conductor for the heating element extends 
from the element to close to the proximal end. The catheter according to the invention is 
especially designed to be used when treating certain cardiac 
arrhythmias. For this purpose the end-section of the 
catheter with the strip-shaped heating element is placed 
against the wall of the heart. Subsequently the heating 
element is excited, thus heating and disturbing the tissue 
in contact with the strip-shaped element. Consequently any 
conduction along the surface of the heart will be 
interrupted. It has become apparent that certain types of 
tachycardias can be caused by different activation waves in 
the cardiac tissue. Treatment with the catheter according to 
the invention as described, will block the conduction of 
these waves and consequently the arrhythmia will be cured. Atrial fibrillation and flutter can be treated by 
creating a conduction block in the free wall of the atrium 
with the aid of the heating element.  The anomalous conduction pathways are thus 
destroyed but the normal pathways remain intact. With the catheter according to the invention also 
the so called re-entry pathways, situated between the 
coronary sinus and the tricuspid valve can be treated. With 
the known treatments the exact location of this re-entry 
pathway must be determined carefully and subsequently 
destroyed. With the elongated electrode situated at the 
flexible part of the catheter according to the invention the 
area could be ablated in its entirety in one go. In general it is very difficult to treat cardiac 
arrhythmias following a myocardial infarction. Expectations 
are that also these tachycardias can be treated successfully 
using the catheter according to the invention. Favourable embodiments will be characterised in 
the sub claims. The invention will be explained in greater detail 
with reference to the attached drawings. Fig. 1 shows a schematic perspective view of a 
catheter according to the invention. Fig. 2
