<DESCRIPTION>
 TTTLE ARTHROPODICIDALPYRAZOLESULFONATESU.S. Patent 3,966,574 discloses insecticidal sulfonates that contain a heteroaromatic ring having three heteroatoms. U.S. Patent 4,791,127 discloses insecticidal thiazole sulfonates and Jacobsen, et al., Pest. Sci., (1990), 29, 96-100 discloses insecticidal oxazole sulfonates. Arthropodicidal pyrazole sulfonates of Formula I have hitherto been unknown. SUMMARY'OF THE INVENTIONThis invention pertains to compounds of Formula I, including all geometric and stereoisomers, agriculturally suitable salts thereof, agricultural compositions containing them and their use for the control of arthropods and nematodes in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments. The compounds are-O-QQ-i Q-2
