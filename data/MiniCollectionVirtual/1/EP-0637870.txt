<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vector control 
apparatus for a speed adjustable induction motor using a 
slip frequency control method. The vector control apparatus 
is so arranged as to compensate for variation in an exciting 
inductance. Various types of a vector control apparatus for an 
induction motor have been proposed in which both a secondary 
magnetic flux and secondary current are controlled with no 
mutual interference. Such a vector control as described above is a 
method in which in a case of a three-phase induction motor 
current and magnetic flux are handled as vectors in two-perpendicular 
d-q coordinate system (cartesian coordinate 
system) which is rotated at the same speed as a rotating 
magnetic field by means of a power supply angular frequency 
and the result of calculation of the vectors is converted 
into a current instruction value of each phase of the three-phase 
power supply. Such a vector control as described above 
is exemplified by a United States Patent No. 5, 136, 228 
issued on August 4, 1992. However, since, in a previously proposed induction 
motor vector control apparatus which achieves the above-described 
control method, no consideration is given to a 
field control, a calculation of correction for a slip is 
executed with an exciting current i1d constant, i.e., i1d = 
λ 2d/M. In a region of field control, therefore, an accurate 
calculation of a set value of a slip angular frequency 
cannot be made. An exciting inductance M' of the induction 
motor is varied according to a frequency and exciting 
current. Thus, if the exciting inductance is controlled with 
a ration of M' to Io (exciting current) constant, an  
 
accurate control of torque becomes impossible. Especially, 
since M' variation in a constant output region is large, an 
accuracy of torque at the constant output may be reduced. Although an excitation instruction λ2d*/M* can be 
controlled to be constant in a constant torque range but is 
controlled so as to be inversely proportional to a motor 
angular frequency ωr in a constant output range. 
Consequently, the exciting inductance M is largely varied in 
The constant output range in which the field control is 
carried out due to a magnetic saturation characteristic of 
an iron core of the induction motor and an accuracy of 
torque is deteriorated. JP-A-4 304 183 relates to vector controller for induction motor (IM). The controller disclosed in JP-A- 4 304 183 enhances accuracy in torque control by compensating for the 
fluctuation of exciting
