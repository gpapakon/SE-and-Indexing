<DESCRIPTION>
 Compositions and Methods For Treating Benign Prostatic HypertrophyThis invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing N- t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof or 17β-(N-t-butylcarboxamide)-estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof and an alpha-andrenergic receptor antagonist compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. This invention also relates to a method of treating benign prostatic hypertrophy in a mammal, including a human, in need thereof which comprises administering an effective dose of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-17β- carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof or 17β-(N-t- butylcarboxamide-estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3-carboxylic acid or a salt thereof and an alpha-andrenergic receptor antagonist compound to such mammal. BACKGROUNDOFTHEINVENTIONAs one of the primary regulators of peripheral vascular tone, α adrenoceptors long have been the targets of efforts to develop agents effective in changing vascular tone for use in treating diseases, such as hypertension, in which alterations in vascular resistance produce therapeutic benefits.Lafferty, et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,963,547 (hereinafter Lafferty I) discloses that compounds which are alpha-andrenergic receptor antagonists are useful in treating cardiovascular diseases in which changes in vascular resistance are desirable, including hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, and peripheral vascular disease. 

 Lafferty I also discloses that said compounds are useful in treating vascular disorders such as diabetes, benign prostatic hypertrophy and ocular hypertension.Lafferty I does not disclose that compounds which are alpha- andrenergic receptor antagonists as having utility in combination with an inhibitor of steroid 5-α-reductase.N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-dienel7β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid and salts thereof (hereinafter Compound A) is disclosed and claimed in Holt, et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568 (Holt I). Holt I discloses Compound A as a novel steroid 5-α-reductase inhibiting compound which exhibits the therapeutic effect of lowering prostatic levels of dihydrotestosterone thereby reducing prostate size.All of the compounds disclosed in Holt I as having 5-α-reductase inhibiting activity have utility in the invented compositions. Holt I does not disclose compound A in combination with an alpha- andrenergic receptor antagonist

4. A composition of claim 2 in which the alpha-andrenergic receptor antagonist is selected firo alfiizosin, indoramin, doxazosin, prazosin, amsulosin and 7-chloro-2-ethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4- methylthieno[4,3,2-efI-[3]benzazepine.
5. A composition according to anyone of claims 1 to 4 for use in therapy.
6. A composition according to anyone of claims 1 to 4 in the manufacture of a medicament for use as a steroid 5-α-reductase inhibitor.
7. A composition according to anyone of claims 1 to 4 in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treatment to reduce prostate size.
8. Use of a composition according to anyone of claims 1 to 4 in the manufacture of a medicament for use as a 5-α-reductase inhibitor.
9. The use of a steroid 5-α-reductase inhibiting compound and an alpha-receptor antagonist compound as an active therapeutic substance which, use consist of separate sequential or simultaneous administration of a steroid 5-α-reductase inhibiting compound and an alpha-receptor antagonist compound. 


 10. The use of a steroid 5-α-reductase inhibiting compound and an alpha-receptor antagonist compound in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy which use consist of separate sequential or simultaneous administration of a 5-α-reductase inhibiting compound and an alpha receptor antagonist compound.
