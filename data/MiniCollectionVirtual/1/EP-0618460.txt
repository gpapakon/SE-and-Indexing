<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the system for position/velocity identification/measurement of an object (C), passive identification tags (1), so-called ID tags, which can be interrogated by radio-frequency pulses are used in accordance with the principle of a surface-wave component. The evaluation of the pulse response signal is based on delay-time/phase-shift measurement or detection of the Doppler frequency shift.

System for determining the relative distance
between two objects by means of radio positioning-finding

using a passive identification mark (ID tag)
(1) which has an input/output antenna (4), in the case

of which the identification mark (1) is a surface
acoustic wave component having a converter and

reflector structure, characterized in that, in order to
determine the relative position between two objects at

a distance from one another uniquely, a plurality of
identification marks (1) with different coding are

applied at a predetermined point on one of the two
objects, and a transmitting/receiving antenna (9) is

applied at a predetermined point on the second object
with respect to this, via which antenna (9) the radio

pulses (11) can be transmitted and pulsed response
signals can be received, and which is connected to an

interrogation/evaluation appliance, and in which case
the interrogation/evaluation appliance is designed such

that the received pulsed response signal (10) can be
used to determine an instantaneous distance (r) between

the transmitting/receiving antenna (9) of the
interrogation appliance and the identification marks

(1), from the delay times for the path lengths between
the antennas and/or from the phase, with respect to a

reference phase, and, from this, the position of the
first object relative to the second object. 
System according to Claim 1, in which three
identification marks (1), in each case at a distance

from one another and at predetermined points on the
object, are applied to one object for orientation

identification, the coding of the pulsed response
signals from which identification marks (1) differs.
System according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
identification marks having different coding are

applied to the object in accordance with a pattern
whose distribution is predetermined.
System according to Claim 3, in which one
identification mark has the shape/mounting means

associated with a specific coding, by means of which
such an identification mark can be distinguished from

identification marks with a different coding, in terms
of the mechanical application.
Method for determining the relative distance
between two objects by means of radio positioning-finding

using a passive identification mark (ID tag)
(1) which has an input/output antenna (4), in the case

of which the identification mark (1) is a surface
acoustic wave component having a converter and

reflector structure, characterized in that, in order to

the transmitting/receiving antenna (9) of the 
interrogation appliance and the identification marks

reference phase, and, from this, the position of the
first object relative to the second object.
Method according to Claim 5, in which the speed
of movement of two objects relative to one another is

determined with the aid of at least two pulsed response
signals which are interrogated successively in time.
Method according to Claim 5 or 6, in which the
profile of the Doppler frequency shift is used to

determine the path velocity and/or to determine the
path point at the shortest distance from the

interrogated identification mark.
Use of a system according to one of Claims 1 to
4 or of a method according to one of Claims 5 to 7 for

gripping, shunting and/or handling a container as the
one object, by means of a gripping/suspension apparatus

as the other object.
Use of a system according to one of Claims 1 to

for identifying the position and aligning a loading
surface as the one object, and a loading harness as the

other object.
Use of a system according to one of Claims 1 to
4 and of a method according to one of Claims 5 to 7,

for coupling a stationary vehicle as the one object to
a vehicle which can move, as the other object.
Use of a system according to one of Claims 1 to

an object which can be picked up by the fork-lift truck

as the other object.
Use of a system according to one of Claims 1 to

for automatically controlling the two objects as they
approach one another.
