<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparation of a medicament for treatment of one or more 
of the following conditions when a herpes virus, particularly the herpes simplex 

virus, is involved in the causation thereof:

   Depression
 

   Irritable bowel syndrome
 

   Fibromyalgia
 

   Headaches
 

   Anxiety
 

   Panic disorder
 

   Narcolepsy
 

   Tourette's disorder
 

   Kleptomania
 

   Bulimia nervosa

   Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity
 

   Cataplexy
 

   Psychopathic disorder
 

   Gingivitis

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to treatment of a group of related disorders which 
may be caused by Herpes Simplex virus (HSV). It covers the use of therapeutic 
agents, known to have activity against HSV, in the disorders to be set out below. One of the inventors has suffered in the past with chronic fatigue syndrome 
(CFS), associated with loss of concentration and poor memory, with irritable bowel 
syndrome, persistent headaches, and repeatedly bleeding gums. A course of 
acyclovir, prescribed for a Herpes virus infection, produced an unexpected and 
complete remission of the chronic fatigue, the irritable bowel syndrome, the 
headaches, and the bleeding gums, as well as an improvement in concentration and 
memory (measured by psychological testing). This raised the possibility that all 
these conditions may be related to infection by HSV. A search through the 
literature for associations between these and other disorders was carried out. This 
search was prompted by the hypothesis that all these conditions might be hitherto 
unrecognised consequences of persistent infection by HSV. It is, of course, well 
known that HSV infections are common in the community, but the well recognised 
lesions consequent on infection and encephalitis are the only diseases currently 
directly attributed to such infections. CFS is a condition characterised by disabling fatigue and a variety of other 
symptoms which occur with varying frequency, low grade fever, myalgias, sleep 
disorder and impaired cognition being amongst the commonest. It is suggested that 
it arises in two stages: 1. Depression of the immune system, which can arise from 
the action of a variety of infectious agents, such as viruses, parasites and bacteria or 
from stress. 2. Primary infection or reactivation of  
 
HSV. HSV could cause the symptoms of CFS by several mechanisms. Firstly, by 
stimulating the production of interferon in the brain. HSV can spread within the 
central nervous system, either in the neurons or at a slow speed in the neuroglial 
cells. In these latter cells it can cause a small area of inflammation, where 
interferon and other cytokines may be produced. Interferon, given therapeutically, 
frequently causes "psychiatric" symptoms closely resembling those seen in CFS. 
Interferon, given prior to surgery for trigeminal nerve decompression, was found to 
cause a paradoxical increase in HSV reactivation. The "psychiatric" symptoms 
which can follow therapeutic use of interferon could, therefore be the result of 
HSV reactivation. Under
