<ABSTRACT>
Oxygen or an oxygen-rich gas is used in the 
production of terephthalic acid in a reaction system 

that mitigates the flammability hazards associated 
therewith. Lower reactant and solvent consumption is 

achieved, with lower production of unwanted by-products, 
lower gas handling costs and lower 

environmental impact concerns than with conventional 
air based terephthalic acid production.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
the production of terephthalic acid. More
particularly, it relates to an enhanced process for the
production of said terephthalic acid.Description of the Prior Art - In a typical air or
enriched air based process for producing terephthalic
acid, liquid p-xylene is fed to a stirred tank reactor,
with a monobasic aliphatic acid, typically acetic acid
being used as a solvent. The ratio of solvent to
reactant is typically one to ten weights of solvent per
volume of reactant (1:1 to 10:1). The reaction is
catalyzed with a heavy metal or mixture of heavy
metals, most commonly cobalt and manganese in the form
of acetate salts. In addition, bromine, in the form of
bromic acid, is commonly used as an initiator. The
reactor is maintained at an operating temperature of
between 170°C and 225°C. The operating pressure is
generally between 791 and 2170 kPa (100 and 300 psig). Compressed air or
enriched air, typically having between 21% and 28%
oxygen, is sparged into the bottom of the reactor.
Oxygen from the air is dissolved into the liquid phase
and reacts with the p-xylene to produce the desired
terephthalic product. Intermediate oxidation products
and by-products are also formed in quantities that
depend on the reaction conditions employed. At a
residence time of one hour, the conversion of p-xylene
is typically about 99%, with the yield to desired
terephthatic product being greater than 96%.The most important intermediate oxidation product
in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA) is 4-carboxybenzaldehyde
(4CBA), which is one oxidation step 
removed from terephthalic acid. The presence of 4CBA
in the TPA product is undesirable. It acts as a chain
terminator in subsequent polymerization reactions which
convert TPA to its most important end products, i.e.,
polyester fibers and polyethylene terephthalate resins.
For a given residence time, the conversion of 4CBA to
TPA has been observed to increase with temperature.
Hence, the concentration of 4CBA in the TPA product
decreases with increased operating temperature, so that
TPA product quality increases at higher operating
temperatures.Raw material losses to undesirable by-products, on
the other hand, also increase with temperature. The
acidic acid solvent and, to a lesser extent, p-xylene,
react to produce carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
methyl bromide and methyl acetate, all of which are
environmentally sensitive materials. Since a high
reaction temperature must be maintained to make product
terephthalic acid that meets applicable

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of
terephthalic acid comprising:


(a) maintaining a portion of a body of
liquid in a recirculating flow condition in a reactor

vessel, said liquid containing p-xylene reactant,
solvent, catalyst and a bromine initiator, the

recirculating portion of the body of liquid having no
gas-liquid interface with an overhead gas phase, said

recirculating portion of the body of liquid being
separated by mechanical means from, but in fluid

communication with, a relatively quiescent portion of
the body of liquid, said quiescent portion of the body

of liquid having a gas-liquid interface with an
overhead gas phase and being adapted to accommodate a

change in liquid level in response to a change in the
volume in the body of liquid between the condition in

which essentially no gas bubbles are in the body of
liquid and the condition that exists when a desired gas

bubble concentration is developed within said body of
liquid;
(b) introducing a feed stream of essentially
pure oxygen, or oxygen-enriched air containing at least

50% oxygen, directly into the recirculating
portion of said body of liquid, and not into said

quiescent portion thereof, the recirculating flow path
and flow velocity of said recirculating portion of the

body of liquid being such, relative to the fluid
communication between said recirculating and quiescent

portions of the body of liquid, that the oxygen bubbles
formed upon the introduction of the feed stream into

the recirculating portion of the body of liquid are
maintained in dispersed form in the recirculating

liquid, for oxygen dissolution in, and reaction with, 
the p-xylene reactant in the recirculating portion of

the body of liquid, without any appreciable passage of
said oxygen bubbles through the fluid communication

between the recirculating portion of the body of liquid
and the quiescent portion thereof and through the

quiescent portion thereof to the gas-liquid interface,
and thus without loss of oxygen to the overhead gas

phase;
(c) maintaining the oxygen-liquid mixture in
the reactor vessel at a temperature of from 150°C

to 200°C, and a pressure of between 791 kPa and 1480 kPa (100
psig and 200 psig), for a residence time of from

30 to 90 minutes; and
(d) recovering desired terephthalic acid
product from the reactor vessel,

whereby said terephthalic acid is produced with the
production of undesired by-products being decreased,

and with advantageously low gas handling requirements,
and decreased environmental impact concerns.
The process of claim 1 in which said solvent
comprises acetic acid.
The process of claim 2 in which the
solvent:p-xylene reactant ratio is from 1:1 to

8:1 on a wt/volume basis.
The process of claim 1 in which said catalyst
comprises a mixture of cobalt and manganese catalysts.
The process of claim 4 in which said catalyst
comprises a mixture of cobalt and manganese acetate,

with the catalyst loading being between 500 and 3,000
ppm based on the volume of the liquid reaction mixture. 
The process of claim 5 in which the ratio of
cobalt catalyst to manganese catalyst is from 0.1:1 to

10:1 on a weight basis.
The process of claim 6 in which said ratio of
cobalt catalyst to manganese catalyst is about 3:1.
The process of claim 1 in which said
initiator comprises hydrogen bromide.
The process of claim 1 in which said feed
stream comprises essentially pure oxygen.
The process of claim 1 in which said feed
stream comprises oxygen-enriched air containing at

least 50% oxygen.
The process of claim 1 in which said
temperature is about 180°C and said pressure is from

997 kPa to 1136 kPa (130 psig to 150 psig).
The process of claim 11 in which said feed
stream comprises essentially pure oxygen.
The process of claim 1 and including passing
an inert gas through the overhead gas phase in the

reactor vessel to purge oxygen therefrom.
The process of claim 1 in which said

recirculating portion of liquid is maintained in a
recirculating flow condition by the essentially central

positioning therein of a hollow draft chamber such that
the open ends thereof are at the bottom and top

thereof, impeller means being positioned within said
hollow draft chamber to cause the oxygen-liquid mixture 

in the major portion of the body of liquid to pass
through said hollow draft chamber.
The process of claim 14 in which said
recirculating portion of the body of liquid is

separated from said quiescent portion thereof by baffle
means positioned in said body of liquid, said

positioning being such as to obviate the accumulation
of individual oxygen bubbles thereunder.
