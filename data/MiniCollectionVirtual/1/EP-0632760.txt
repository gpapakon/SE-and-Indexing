Method of casting and subsequently curing a component 
or several components, such as line transformers, with 

an impregnating mass and of curing the mass in an 
oven, the method comprising the following steps: 


a) introducing a component or a pallet of several 
components into a casting chamber (48) that can be 

placed under vacuum, 
b) creating a vacuum in the casting chamber (50), 
c) using the mass under vacuum or at below atmospheric 
pressure to cast the component or several components - 

one after the other, as the case may be, 
d) venting the casting chamber (56), 
e) removing the component or the pallet (46) of 
several components and curing thereof in an oven,
 
characterised in that
 
the mass represents a single component mass, which 

does not harden at room temperature but does so within 
a short period (e.g. in less than 30 minutes) at 

increased temperature (e.g. 60° to 80°C), and the 
curing process is effected in an oven comprising three 

chambers in accordance with the following additional 
steps of the method: 
f) the component or the pallet (46) holding several 
components is introduced into a gated oven pre-chamber 

(68) of the curing oven (60),  
 
g) the gated oven pre-chamber is closed and brought to 
below atmospheric pressure (88), 
h) the gated oven pre-chamber (68) is opened into a 
main oven chamber (70) and the component or pallet 

(46) of components is moved into the main oven chamber 
(70) and the main oven chamber closed, 
i) the component or pallet (46) of components is 
passed through the main oven chamber, together with 

other components or other pallets of components as the 
case may be, synchronised with the introduction of 

additional components or pallets of components into 
the gated oven pre-chamber or the main oven chamber, 
k) the main oven chamber is opened into a gated oven 
after-chamber and the component or 
pallet (46) of 
components is moved from the main oven chamber into 

the gated oven after-chamber and the gated oven after-chamber 
is closed, 
l) the gated oven after-chamber is vented and the 
component or pallet of components is removed from the 

gated oven after-chamber. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
before casting or during casting (step c), the mass is 

heated, preferably by means of a heatable mixer (38) 
capable of producing a back-pressure, to a temperature 

approaching that at which the curing process is 
initiated and this heated mass is applied to a 

component or the components on a pallet. 
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the process of passing through the main oven  

 
chamber (step h) is timed synchronously with the 

process of passing through the gated pre-chamber and 
the gated after-chamber. 
Method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
between the gated pre-chamber and the gated after-chamber 

the pressurised and heated gas located within 
the chambers is pumped around at an appropriately 

timed rate. 
Method as claimed in one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that air vented (90, 290) from the 

gated chambers is recirculated in order to recuperate 
the heat and pressure. 
Device for casting a component or each of several 
components, such as line transformers, with an 

impregnating mass and for curing the mass in an oven, 
consisting of a supply container (10) for the casting 

mass, a metering device (30) co-operating with the 
supply container (10) and opening into a casting 

chamber (48), preferably one which can be placed under 
vacuum, above the component to be cast or the 

components to be cast, a conveying device (54) for the 
component or components (e.g. arranged on a pallet 

(46)) which passes through the casting chamber (48), 
whereby the casting chamber is a single chamber or 

three chambers separated from one another by dividing 
walls (e.g. gated pre-chamber, main chamber, gated 

after-chamber), characterised in that a single-component 
material is used which does not cure at room 

temperature but does so at increased temperature (e.g. 
60° to 80°C) within a short time (e.g. in less than 30 

minutes), a device for heating the casting mass is 
arranged after the metering device (30), such as a  

 
heatable mixer (138), opening into the casting chamber 

(48) by means of a casting valve (42), and the casting 
chamber (48) connects with a continuous oven (60) for 

curing the mass in the components at a pressure above 
atmospheric pressure and at increased temperature, 

whereby the conveying device (54) passes into, through 
(154, 254, 354) and out of (54) the continuous oven. 
Device as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that 
the continuous oven (60) consists of three chambers 

(e.g. gating-in chamber (68), main chamber (70), 
gating-out chamber (72)). 
Device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 7, 
characterised in that the gated chambers (68, 72) 

connect with one another by means of a pressure 
delivery device (92, 94), by means of which venting 

(e.g. passive) is possible from one chamber into the 
other chamber. 
Device as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that a 
pumping device is incorporated on the pressure pipe 

linking the gated chambers with one another, which 
pumps heated, pressurised air contained in one gated 

chamber into the other gated chamber. 
Device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that the individual chambers (68, 70, 

72) are linked to heating devices (214, 314, 414), 
which keep the chamber walls (220, 320, 420) at an 

adjustable temperature. 
Device as claimed in claim 10, characterised in that 
the devices are cavities (220, 320, 420) surrounding 

the chambers, such that a heating medium is fed  
 

through from one end (80) and heating medium is fed 
out at the other end (82). 
Device as claimed in claim 11, characterised in that 
with respect to the pre-chamber and the after-chamber 

(68, 72), the end at which the heating medium is fed 
in (80 or 480) is that at which an outwardly facing 

gate (62 or 78) is located. 
Device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that infra-red radiators (103) are 

provided, which can be timed such as to be applied to 
at least one surface (115) of the mass to be cured. 
Device as claimed in claim 13, characterised in that 
a pyrometer (1190 is provided, which senses the 

temperature of the surface (115) of the mass to be 
cured. 
Device as claimed in claim 13 or 14, characterised in 
that the infra-red radiators (103) and pyrometer (119) 

are connected to a control circuit by means of a 
control device, such as a micro-processor, such that 

the surface (115) of the mass to be cured is heated 
within a first pre-determined period to a pre-determined 

temperature and this surface is then held 
at this temperature for a further pre-determined time. 
Device as claimed in one of claims 13 to 15, 
characterised in that the infra-red radiator (103) 

consists of several quartz pipes arranged adjacent to 
one another, each coaxial with the axis of the oven 

(101), such that the surface spanned by the axes of 
the quartz pipes lies essentially parallel with and at 

a distance from the surface (115) of the mass to be  
 

cured - which lies by preference parallel with the 
surface of the ground. 
Device as claimed in claim 16, characterised in that 
the measuring angle (121) of the pyrometer (119) is 

directed at an acute angle (α) onto the measuring 
surface.
