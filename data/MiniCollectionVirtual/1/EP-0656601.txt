<ABSTRACT>
An automated license plate locator and reader (10) 
which provides novel methods for 1) correcting for 

perspective distortion (16), 2) locating the license 
plate (20), 3) reading the license plate (22) and 4) 

improving the confidence rating of the output signal 
(228). The novel method for accommodating a wide range 

of viewing geometries involves warping the image to 
eliminate perspective distortion of the plate resulting 

from roadside camera placement. The novel method for 
locating plates involves correlating an "idealized" edge 

template of a license plate with an edge-enhanced version 
of the image. Edge enhancement and shadow reduction is 

achieved by applying a Laplacian operator over the input 

image. Performance is further improved by filtering out 
distracting edges within the resulting correlation 

surface and then locating the highest peaks within this 
filtered correlation surface. The location of the 

highest peaks provides the location of the plate. The 
novel method for reading the license plates involves 

performing a modified binary correlation of an image of 
the plate with reference characters to provide output 

signals indicative of the symbols on the plate. This 
output is correlated with valid license plate signals to 

improve the confidence rating thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image processing 
and recognition systems. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to license plate locators and readers. While the present invention is described herein with 
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular 
applications, it should be understood that the invention 
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in 
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will 
recognize additional modifications, applications, and 
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional 
fields in which the present invention would be of 
significant utility. For many applications, there is a need for a system 
for reading a license plate of a motorized vehicle. One 
such application involves the automated monitoring of 
traffic flow to identify vehicles traveling at excessive 
speeds. Another application involves the automatic 
identification of vehicles passing through toll booths 
without payment of the toll. Many systems are known in the art for reading 
license plates. See, for example, "Development and 
Application of Vehicle-license Number Recognition System
