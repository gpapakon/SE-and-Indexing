<ABSTRACT>
Method for sequencing DNA which includes the following steps: providing a polynucleotide primer complementary to a region of the DNA, providing the DNA to be sequenced, and contacting that primer and DNA together in the presence of a DNA polymerase and between 1 and 3 dNTPs, at least one of the dNTP being labeled. The primer and DNA are contacted under conditions which allow extension of the primer by addition of one or more of the dNTPs to the primer to form an extended primer. The primer and DNA are then dissociated, generally be heating, and the contacting and dissociating steps repeated a plurality of times (usually 10-200 times). Finally, the extended primer is contacted with the DNA in the presence of a DNA polymerase (which is generally the same polymerase as used in the initial labeling step) all four dNTPs and a chain terminating agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for DNA
sequencing in which a labeled nucleotide is incorporated
into an extending DNA molecule during a chain
termination sequencing method.The sequence of nucleotide bases in a DNA
molecule can be determined in a variety of ways. The
chain termination method generally involves synthesizing
DNA, complementary to the template strand to be
sequenced, by extending a primer able to hybridize to a
portion of that template strand, with a DNA polymerase.
During the synthesis reaction, deoxynucleoside
triphosphates (dNTPs) are incorporated to form a DNA
fragment until a chain terminating agent, for example, a
dideoxynucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP) is incorporated.
Incorporation of a ddNTP prevents further DNA synthesis
(a process called chain termination). The size of each
DNA fragment synthesized in this procedure is then
determined by gel electrophoresis, and this information
used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in the
original template DNA. For example, Tabor and
Richardson, U.S. Patent 4,795,699, describe a two step
sequencing method in which an unlabeled primer is
labeled in a labeling step, and then extended in the
presence of excess dNTPs and a ddNTP in a chain
termination step. In the labeling step a low
concentration of dNTPs is provided (one being labeled)
to allow a small amount of primer extension.In the dideoxy sequencing method, the primer
may be labeled, for example, with 32P, by a process using
a polynucleotide kinase. Such labeling allows detection
of extended primers after gel electrophoresis by
autoradiography of the resulting gel. Alternatively, a 
labeled dNTP may be incorporated during the process of
DNA synthesis, and the presence of such labeled dNTPs
detected by autoradiography or other means. To this
end, the dNTP may be labeled either radioactively with
32P or 35S. In another procedure, the primer can be
labeled with one or more fluorescent moieties for
detection by fluorescence. In yet another procedure,
the ddNTP may be labeled, for example, with a
fluorescent marker.Examples of these procedures are provided in
the following publications:Murray, 17 Nucleic Acid Research 8889, 1989
describes use of a 32P-labeled primer. The primer was
labeled by use of a polynucleotide kinase and gamma-32P
ATP.Higuchi and Ochman, 17 Nucleic Acid Research
5865, 1989, describe use of a kinase-labeled primer for
sequencing DNA fragments produced by a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). PCR is a method for amplifying a
desired nucleic acid by use of two primers
