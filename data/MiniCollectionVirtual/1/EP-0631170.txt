<ABSTRACT>
A display assembly includes a display screen having a 
predetermined generally planar area for displaying 

transmissive data. A light source is provided for generating 
light of predetermined intensity, and a circular Fresnel lens 

is disposed between the light source and the display means, 
the circular Fresnel lens imaging the light source through the 

display means and onto an opposite side of the display means. 
A diffuser is disposed between the light source and the 

display means for diffusing the light. The intensity of the 
light source is selected to be appropriate for direct human 

viewing of the transmissive data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to transmissive data
displays, and more particularly to a back-lighting system for
a liquid crystal display.In the field of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), substantial
resources have been expended to provide bright screen displays
having high-resolution and wide viewing angles. Generally,
the brighter the LCD display, the higher the resolution, and
the wider the viewing angle through which the display is
visible, the better the display is considered to be. This is
generally true, for example, in the fields of laptop computers
and LCD televisions.Much research has thus gone into developing bright, wide-angle,
high-resolution LCD displays, such as the color
displays found on laptop computers like the IBM CL57SX. These
LCD displays are of excellent quality when measured against
the desirable characteristics mentioned above. They also
require significant amounts of power to function, yielding
relatively short viewing times of about one hour when battery-powered
for portable use.Set out below are several examples of LCD displays including
back-lighting systems selected to collimate light projected
through the displays, making the displays more efficient.U.S. Patent No. 4,704,004 to Nosker shows a light box
incorporating a reflector, a linear Fresnel lens, polarizers
and a diffuser, for collimating light to uniformly illuminate
a liquid crystal display. The collimated light is projected 
through the LCD display, and the diffuser is positioned as
desired to widen the viewing angle.U.S. Patent No. 4,874,228 to Aho et al. shows a backlit
display including a lens structured to reflect narrow-angle-incident
light at 90° to the angle of incidence. At least
one light source is positioned to provide light at a narrow
angle of incidence. This light is reflected at a 90° angle,
projecting an essentially collimated beam through an adjacent
LCD display.JP-A-5011248 discloses a backlit LCD display device. The LCD
unit 1 is constituted as the opening/closing type, so when
the LCD unit 1 is opened, a sufficient distance is secured
between the LCD unit 1 and fluorescent lamp 3 and the need to
the uniforming of projection light due to light shielding is
eliminated to improve the efficiency. Further, a Fresnel lens
2 is provided on the reverse surface of the LCD unit 1 and
the defocusing effect and converging effect of the Fresnel
lens 2 are utilized to project light uniformly and
efficiently by the fluorescent lamp 3 without any brightness
irregularity.In contrast to systems utilizing
