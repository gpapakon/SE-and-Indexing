<ABSTRACT>
A folding box useful for tidying-up and storing goods, which consists 
of the base (1) where the two sides (3) bearing handles (8), as well as 

the shorter front (4) and the larger back (2) sides are attached with 
the assistance of the support plates (7,7a,7b,7c). The sides of the box 

are fastened to each other with angular fixtures (5,6). All sides 
consist of a main part and a smaller part (10,10a,10b,10c) connected to 

the main part with a strip of membrane (11,11a,11b,11c) and to the base 
with another strip of membrane (12,12a,12b,12c). The small parts of the 

sides bear contact pads (13,13a,13b,13c) that enable their attachment to 
each other and which close the existing gaps. The sides also bear 

aeration holes (9). The base can also bear such holes. The box is made 
of plastic or any other suitable recyclable material (wood, cardboard 

etc.).

<DESCRIPTION>
It is an invention which is referred to a folding box the aim of which is 
the arrangement-storage of merchandises. The folding box is necessary, at 
home for the arrangement of fruits, vegetables, toys and various other things, 
in the factory for the various small machine-parts equipments, in the garden 
for the hobbies. There are different sorts of boxes, a special type is the one 
of ours which has many more advantages compared with the other boxes 
regarding the following. 
Because of folding its transport is easy and also its sale to a small package 
and afterwards its setting to a specific place. In addition to this because of folding of its 4 sides we are able to close 
whichever box is not used and as a result we free the space which are 
valuable to us (e.g. balcony - storage room) The perimetric membrane in all 4 sides with which their main body is 
combined with the second, it has the role of hinge for the possibility of being 
flexible during the connection of the box and of coming back to its 
horizontal position during the phase of dismantling. In addition to this, the existence perimetrically in ordinary spaces of the 
neurons and also of the spikes reassures the regular distribution of the 
cargos of the content of each box on the whole surface of the bottom. In this invention a folding box appears which is constructed by the base 
combined with its 4 sides perimetrically with a cover of membrane from the 
same material. A membrane also exists perimetrically in all 4 sides where their main body is 
combined with the second section.  The box is constructed in 4 versions and in particular: The A version has the 
two sides of the same height and the other two, the one equal in height with 
the previous two and the facing one lower. The B version has all the 4 sides in the same height from which the 2 are 
folded in 3. The C version has all the four sides in the same height from 
which the two are folded in two and finally the D version with the same 
height and all 4 sides folded in 2. A practical application is given in connection with the attached figures. At figure 1 we are able to see in a perspective design the box as it is unfold. At figure 2 we are able to see in a perspective design the box in a position of 
assemblage. At figure 3 we can see in a A-A section the oblique view of the box. At figure 4 we can see in a B-B section the facade of the box. At figure 5 we can see the settlement of the box over another one. At figure 6 we can see the box as it sorts out from the machine in

1- A folding box which is constructed in 4 versions (14a), (14b), (14c), 
(14d) the aim of which is the arrangement-storage of merchandises and it is 

characterized by the fact that the A version is composed of the buttom (1) 
where with the help of the neurons (7), (7a), (7b), (7c) the two sides (3) with 

the handles (8) are developped with the other two sides (the small in front 
(4) and the big in the back (2) ). The sides are buttoned up between them 

and with formations at the corner (5), (6). The sides except of their main 
body have correspondently secondary small parts (10), (10a), (10b), (10c) 

which are connected to the main with membrane (11), (11a), (11b), (11c) 
and followingly the same with the buttom with a membrane (12), (12a), 

(12b), (12c). The parts of the sides have stringes (13), (13a), (13b), (13c) in 
order to touch one another similarly closing the existing space. 

The sides also have holes of airing (9) that also the buttom may have. The 
construction's material is plastic or another available recycled ecological 

material (wood-paper-mass). 
2- A folding box constructed in 4 versions (14a), (14b), (14c), (14d) like in 
the claim land which is characterized by the fact that the B vesion (14b) has 

all of the four sides in the same height from which the two are folded in 3. 
The C version (14c) again with the 4 sides of the same height from which 

the 2 are folded in 2 and finally the D version (14d) with 4 sides of the same 
height and folded in 2 all of the 4.
