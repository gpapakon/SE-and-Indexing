<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10, 50) for removing frozen water from 
vehicle glass includes a cured, microwave-heatable layer 

(14, 64). The microwave-heatable layer (14, 64) may be 
formed from at least one elastomeric gum, a curing catalyst 

adaptable to cure the gum, and microwave-heatable 
particulate matter dispersed in the gum. In one 

embodiment, the apparatus (10) is a mitt including an 
insulative layer (42) which is positioned to be interposed 

between an inner surface (27) of the elastomeric pad (14) 
and the hand, such that the hand does not undergo 

temperature stress. The mitt (10) also preferably includes 
a visual marker (30) to indicate the temperature of the 

elastomeric pad (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
methods and apparatus for the defrosting and de-icing of
vehicle windshields and glass according to the preambles
of claim 1 and claim 11. A device according to the preamble
of claim 1 is disclosed in DE-U-9 305 609.Various devices have been proposed for use in
removing water or cleaning materials from a vehicle body.
For example French Patent number 1 043 919 discloses a
glove which is provided with projections capable of
absorbing water, the glove having channels through which
absorbed water can be removed when the projections are
pressed.As long as there have been windshields on
automobiles, trucks, airplanes and the like, there has been
the problem of removing frozen water, such as frost, snow,
ice, sleet, et cetera from the exterior (and sometimes the
interior) surfaces of the glass or other transparent
windshields and windows of vehicles in climates where
freezing temperatures are common. To accomplish this
purpose, various scrapers and brushes have long been 
employed. Also very old in the art is the concept of
having electrical heating elements built into the vehicle
glass in order to remove frost and the like. A further
method is the application of hot air to the interior
surfaces of the vehicle window or windshield to melt the
frozen water deposit on the exterior surface thereof.
These prior art methods of frozen water removal can be
generally placed into two classes: melting and abrasion.While the above prior art methods eventually
accomplish their objectives, problems remain with each of
them. Under certain conditions, ice or partially melted
snow has an amazingly good adherence to vehicle windshields
and is only removed by scraping with considerable effort.
Electrical heaters and hot air blowers may be ineffective
in removing a large deposit of frozen water within an
acceptable period of time. Further, electrical heaters and
blowers typically require the engine to be turned on;
electrical heaters and blowers produce a drain on the
battery, and electrical blowers typically require the
engine to have already reached a warm operating
temperature, thereby consuming gasoline. Of course,
chipping away at an ice deposit with a scraper or the like
subjects the user to a prolonged period of time in weather
which is less than ideal. Therefore, a need continues to
exist for improved methods and apparatus used in de-icing
or defrosting automobile windshields and windows. According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided apparatus for removing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for removing frozen water from
a vehicle windshield or window by hand, the apparatus

(10) including a heatable layer (14) with an exterior
surface (28) for contacting the windshield or window and

means (22,23) connected to the layer (28) for
controlling the apparatus (10) by the hand,

characterized in that

   the heatable layer (14) is a matrix in which
there is dispersed particulate matter susceptible of

heating by microwave radiation, such that when the
heatable layer (14) is exposed to microwave radiation of

a predetermined dose, the layer (14) will become hot and
may then be applied to the windshield or window to melt

frozen water.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, including an
insulator (22,42,25) interposed between the heatable

layer (14) and the hand for protecting the hand from the
heat of the heatable layer (14) when heated, the

insulator (22,42,25) being substantially transparent to
microwave radiation.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the
insulator (22,42,25) i
ncludes a fabric layer (22,42,25).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3,
wherein the heatable layer (14) is mounted on a first

fabric layer (25), said first fabric layer being joined
to said insulative layer (42) and said means (22,23) for

controlling the apparatus (10) by hand.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the heatable layer (14) has opposed lateral 

margins, said means (22,23) for controlling the
apparatus by hand including a substantially microwave-nonabsorptive

fabric layer (22,23) connected to said
opposed lateral margins of said heatable layer (14) and

extending between said opposed lateral margins to create
a cavity (15) for the hand.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein a marker (30,31) is affixed to the heatable

layer (14), the marker (30,31) exhibiting a first
appearance when the heatable layer (14) is at a first

temperature and a second appearance when the heatable
layer (14) is at a second temperature lower than the

first temperature, the first and second temperatures
being predetermined such that the marker (30,31) gives

a visual indication that the heatable layer (14) has
cooled to the point that the ability of the heatable

layer to melt water is substantially reduced, the marker
(30,31) reassuming the first appearance when the

heatable layer (14) is reheated to the first
temperature.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the
marker (30,31) covers a portion of the heatable layer

(14) leaving an uncovered portion thereof, the marker
(30,31) having a first colour at the first temperature

and a second colour at the second temperature, one of
the first and second colours being chosen to blend in

with the uncovered portion of the heatable layer (14),
the other of the first and second colours being chosen

to contrast with the uncovered portion of the heatable
layer (14).
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein said heatable layer (14) is flexible. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the matrix of the heatable layer (14) is formed

of an elastomer.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9, wherein the
elastomer is polydiorganosiloxane.
A method for removing frozen water from a
vehicle windshield or window by hand, including the

steps of heating a heatable layer (14), insulating the
hand from the heatable layer and applying the heated

heatable layer to the windshield or window, the method
further characterized in having the following steps:


dispersing microwave-heatable particles in a
matrix to form the heatable layer (14);
heating the heatable layer (14) in a microwave
oven to a predetermined temperature;
removing the heatable layer (14) from the
microwave oven; and
thereafter applying the heatable layer (14) to
the windshield or window to melt frozen water therefrom.
A method as claimed in Claim 11, including the
further steps of


responsive to said step of heating, causing a
visual marker (30,31) affixed to the heatable layer (14)

to have a first visual appearance;
responsive to melting the frozen water,
lowering the temperature of the heatable layer (14); and
when the temperature of the heatable layer
(14) has dropped to a second predetermined temperature,

causing the visual marker (30,31) to change from the
first visual appearance to a second visual appearance

substantially different from the first visual
appearance, the marker (30,31) reverting to the first 

visual appearance when said heatable layer (14) is
reheated to the first temperature.
