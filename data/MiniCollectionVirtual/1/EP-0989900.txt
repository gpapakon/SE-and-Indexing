<ABSTRACT>
An air drier arrangement comprises an air compressor (1), an air drier (3) and air conduits (2, 4). In order to obtain favourable working conditions for the arrangement under different temperatures there is a switch-over valve (6) in a separate signal air pipe (5) from the air drier to the compressor. This valve is operable between a first position, giving a governor mode for the arrangement, and a second position, giving an unloader mode for the arrangement. The operation of the valve may be governed by a thermostat (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air drier
arrangement, comprising an air compressor, an air drier, an
air conduit from the compressor to the air drier and an air
conduit from the air drier to an air tank or an air
consumer.It is generally known that it is important to keep
the inlet temperature to an air drier within a certain
span, for example +4 - +65Â°C, but actually as low as
possible. In many applications, when a so called governor
mode for the control of the arrangement is used (see e.g. WO91/16224), this leads
to problems with freezing in the air conduit between the
compressor and the air drier.Namely, in the governor mode the air flow stops, when
the compressor is unloaded, leading under certain
circumstances to a temperature drop below the freezing
point. One advantage with this mode, however, is its energy
saving ability.When on the other hand a so called on-line unloader
mode for the control of the arrangement is used, non-pressurized
air blows through said conduit from the
compressor and out to the atmosphere via the unloader valve
of the air drier, when the arrangement is unloaded.From an energy conserving viewpoint this system has
disadvantages, but said conduit is always kept at an even
temperature, most often above the freezing point also at
low temperatures. Further, the conduit and the air drier
are blown clean from water that can freeze to ice.The object of the invention is to combine the
advantages of the two well-known control modes described
above. This is according to the invention attained in that 
in a separate signal air pipe from the air drier to the
compressor there is a switch-over valve, operable between a
first position, in which air passes through the valve for
accomplishing a governor mode for the arrangement, and a
second position, in which the air pipe from the air drier
is closed and the air pipe to the compressor is open to the
atmosphere for accomplishing an unloader mode for the
arrangement.In a preferred embodiment the valve is a 3/2 way
valve, which is spring biassed to the first position and
automatically may be brought to the second position by
means of an electrically energized solenoid controlled by a
thermostat device.The invention will be described in further detail
below reference being made to the accompanying drawing, in
which the single Figure schematically illustrates an air
drier arrangement embodying the invention.An air drier arrangement shown in the Figure has an
air compressor 1 supplying pressurized air throgh an air
conduit 2 to an air drier
