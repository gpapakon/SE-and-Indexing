<ABSTRACT>
Polysaccharides from the gum exudates of Astragalus species Tragacantha section plants are extracted, separated and modified into water-soluble forms free of small molecular impurities. The purified polysaccharide forms are immunomodulators which inhibit cancer cells and viruses, and can be used to treat immunologically defective disease states. The polysaccharide-homogeneous products from different Astragalus species exhibit the same kind of immunomodulatory activity in different mammalian systems, but differ in potency. The purified polysaccharide forms of these GRAS gum tragacanth products show no toxicity on parenteral administration.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Astragalus Polysaccharide ImmunomodulatorsField of the InventionThis invention concerns the preparation and use of purified fractions of a polysaccharide exudate of certain Astragalus plant species, which inhibit cancers and viruses in mammals and can be used to treat immunological related disorders. More particularly, it relates to aqueous infusions of polysaccharides from certain Tragacantha section Astragalus species which have immunomodulatory activity to inhibit the formation, growth, multiplication and spread of malignant tumors, to inhibit the replication of pathogenic viruses, and to treat other immunologically susceptible diseases.Background of InventionThe genus Astragalus. family Leguminosae. comprises 2000 or more species widely distributed throughout the world, of which only certain plants, in the section Tragacantha. produce a polysaccharide rich exudate. Most of the polysaccharide gum producing species are indigenous to the Middle East countries from Eastern Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, Iraq and Iran to Western China. The gum from these Astragalus species is a commercial commodity called tragacanth. It is used in foods as a stabilizer, thickener and emulsifier, and in pharmaceutical products as a suspending agent. It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under Food and Drug Administration classification for use in foods in the United States. Other countries also classify tragacanthSUBSTITUTESHEET 

as safe for food additive use.The gum is stored in the central cylinder of the tap root of the plant. It is collected from the live plant by cutting a slot or drilling a hole in the root cylinder below the crown, whereupon the gum exudes out as a ribbon. The gum dries within 1-2 hours becoming semi- brittle, and can be picked off by hand. The gum contains both water-soluble and insoluble polysaccharides and other minor components. The chemically heterogeneous whole dried exudates are marketed as tragacanth ribbon or powder. In the past it was estimated that as much as one million pounds of tragacanth per year were harvested from wild plants for food additive and pharmaceutical uses.Roe ("Growth Inhibition of Mouse Ascites Tumor Cells by Powdered Tragacanth (Tragacanthae Pulvis, B.P.)," Nature 184:1891 (1959)), found that some tragacanth powders inhibited the multiplication of cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity of mice. SuspendedLandschutz ascites cancer cells were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of mice where they multiplied and could be assayed by counting techniques. The serous fluid of

 CLAIMS
What is Claimed Is:
1. A process for separating, purifying and modifying the polysaccharide fractions of gum tragacanth from Astragalus species plants comprising:
