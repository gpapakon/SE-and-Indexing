<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for use in a network to provide 
authentication of packets of data, provide security to 

ensure the prevention of unauthorized receipt of data, to 
provide improved monitoring of the packets of data 

transmitted and received over such a network, and to 
detect changes in the network topology. Repeaters 

utilized in the network are provided with the capability 
to detect and interpret packet data and the source 

address (SA) and destination address (DA) fields to 
provide the improved features.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to address 
tracking within a local area network and more 
particularly to address tracking within a network that 
utilizes Multiport Repeaters. In traditional Ethernet (802.3 10BASE5) and 
Cheapernet (802.3 10BASE2) a coaxial cable provides the 
linear bus to which all nodes are connected. Signalling 
is accomplished using a current synch technique with a 
center conductor used for the signal and a shield used as 
a ground reference. Twisted pair Ethernet (802.3 10BASE-T) 
utilizes standard voice grade telephone cable, 
employing separate transmit and receive pairs. The 
system uses a star topology. At the center of a star is 
a repeater. The repeater performs signal amplitude and 
timing restoration. It takes the incoming bitstream and 
repeats it to all the ports connected to it. In this 
sense the repeater acts as a logical coaxial cable so 
that any node connected to the network will see another 
node's transmission. Differential signalling is employed 
with one pair acting as the transmit path and the other 
pair acting as the receive path. While repeaters are used in traditionally wired 
coaxial Ethernet as a means to extend the networks  
 
physical distance limit, in the IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T, the 
Standard mandates the use of a repeater to actually 
provide the connectivity function if more than two nodes 
are required. Although the physical signalling on the 
cabling differs, the functionality of the repeater is 
identical in either coaxial or twisted pair networks as 
is the frame or packet format that is used to pass 
messages between the participating nodes on the network. The frame commences with a preamble sequence which 
is an alternating (1,0) pattern. The preamble provides a 
single frequency on the network, in this case 5 (MHz) at 
the start of each frame, which allows a receiver to lock 
to the incoming bitstream. This preamble sequence is 
then followed by a start of packet which indicates that 
the data portion of the message will follow. Either a 
start of frame delimiter (802.3) or synch sequence 
(Ethernet) is used to delineate the start of the data 
portion of the message. The next two fields are the 
destination address (DA) and the source address (SA) for 
the frame. Both are 48 bit values which are transmitted 
least significant bit (LSB) first. The destination address is used by the receiving 
media access controller (MAC) to determine if the 
incoming packet is addressed to this particular node. If 
the receiving node detects a match

packets of data, each of the packets including a source 

address (SA) field and a destination address (DA) field, 
a system comprising: 

   means for storing a value representation of a SA 
field; 

   means for receiving a SA field from the network; and

means for comparing the SA field to the value, wherein a 
signal is provided responsive to the comparison 

indicating a match or mismatch.

means comprises a plurality of random access memories 

(RAMs). 
The system of claim 2 in which each of the RAM 
are 32 bits wide. 
The system of claim 1 in which the SA field is 
written into memory through an external interface. 
The system of claim 1 in which the SA field is 
automatically updated when a valid frame is received. 
In a repeater that transmits and receives a 
plurality of packets of information within a network, 

each of the packets including a source address (SA) field 
and a destination address (DA) field, a system comprising: 

 
means for receiving a DA field; 

   means for storing a plurality of addresses 
representing ports coupled to the repeater; 

   comparing the DA field to the plurality of 
addresses; and 

   means for disrupting the packet if there is not a 
match. 
The system of claim 6 which includes means 
coupled to the disrupting means for preventing the 

disrupting of a packet when the packet is a multicast or 
broadcast format. 
In a repeater that transmits and receives a 
plurality of packets of data, each of the packets 

including a source address field and a destination 
address field, the system comprising: 

   means for storing an address into the system; 
   means for receiving an address representing an 

incoming packet from a port; 
   means for providing an interrupt indicating a match 

between the stored address and the incoming address; and 
   means for providing the identity of the port on 

which the match occurred.
