<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fuel injection pumps of 
the type having a pump rotor with a pumping chamber with one 
or more radially extending pumping plunger bores, a pumping 
plunger mounted in each plunger bore, annular cam means 
surrounding the pump rotor for reciprocating the pumping 
plungers for supplying intake charges of fuel to the pumping 
chamber and periodically delivering charges of fuel from the 
pumping chamber at high pressure for fuel injection, and a 
distributor head with a plurality of distributor outlets, the 
pump rotor being rotatably mounted within the distributor head 
and forming a distributor rotor with one or more distributor 
ports for distributing the high pressure charges of fuel to 
the plurality of distributor outlets in sequence (such fuel 
injection pumps being referred to herein as "Rotary 
Distributor Type Fuel Injection Pumps"). The high pressures within such Rotary Distributor Type 
Fuel Injection Pumps present certain operating problems as 
follows: 
(a) a large axial force on the rotor thrust bearing causes 
galling and eventually mechanical failure of the thrust 
bearing; and (b) high pressure pulsations subject certain portions of the 
pump rotor to a large cyclical stress, resulting in 
crack initiation, crack propagation and eventually pump 
rotor failure. Additionally, because the fuel charges are distributed 
at high pressure, the relatively rotating surfaces of the 
distributor head and distributor rotor are required to have 
a very precise rotational fit (for example, a diametral 
clearance of 80 - 100 millionths of an inch) to ensure 
adequate sealing and lubrication. The precise rotational fit 
presents certain operating problems as follows: 
(a) during pump operation, particularly at high speed and 
during rapid acceleration, a substantial amount of heat 
is generated by the thin layer of fuel lubricant between  
 
the relatively rotating surfaces of the distributor 
rotor and distributor head; (b) adequate lubrication of the relatively rotating surfaces 
is difficult to achieve at high speed and high 
temperature, particularly with low viscosity fuels such 
as gasoline and methanol; and (c) the thermal expansion of the outer diameter of the 
distributor rotor and inner diameter of the distributor 
head must occur at approximately the same rate 
throughout the full range of operation of the pump and 
particularly during cold starting and rapid 
acceleration; otherwise, the resulting unequal thermal 
expansion of the parts will cause inadequate
