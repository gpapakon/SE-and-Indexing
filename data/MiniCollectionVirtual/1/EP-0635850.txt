<CLAIMS>
A high-frequency broadband electrical coaxial 
cable comprising 


a cylindrical inner conductor (2, 3) disposed 
on a plastics core (1) and including an electrically 

conducting foil (2) wound in helical 
overlapping manner, 
an outer conductor (5) concentric therewith 
and a dielectric (4) located between inner 
conductor (2, 3) and outer conductor (5), 
 
characterized in that the inner conductor (2, 3) 

is of double-layer construction, comprising an 
inner layer in the form of said wound foil (2) and 

an outer layer in the form of a round conductor 
stranded system (3) in electrical contact with 

said inner layer. 
The coaxial cable of claim 1,
 
characterized in that the inner layer (2) is wound 

using a copper foil. 
The coaxial cable of claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the inner layer (2) is wound 

using a silvered foil. 
The coaxial cable of any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that the outer layer (3) is composed 

with stranded copper wires.  
 
The coaxial cable of any one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the outer layer (3) is composed 

with stranded round conductors. 
The coaxial cable of any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the plastics core (1) is 

composed with FEP (fluoroethylenepropylene). 
The coaxial cable of any one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that the plastics core (1) is 

hollow. 
The coaxial cable of any one of claims 1 to 7,
 
characterized in that the outer conductor (5) is 

surrounded by a plastics jacket (6). 
The coaxial cable of any one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterized in that the dielectric (4) consists 

of microporous PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene).
