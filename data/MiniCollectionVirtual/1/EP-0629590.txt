<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a porous glass preform for 
optical fiber by depositing fine glass particles on an 

outer surface of a glass material while moving the glass 
material, including the steps of: preheating a portion of 

the glass material to clean the portion of the glass 
material in an apparatus for depositing fine glass 

particles; and depositing fine glass particles on the 
portion of the glass material cleaned by the preheating, 

in the apparatus for depositing fine glass particles. 
The preheating is preferably carried out by use of an oxyhydrogen burner 

or an electric resistance heater. The preheating atmosphere may contain 
water vapour or steam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
forming an aggregate or agglomerate of fine glass 
particles on an outer surface of a starting material 
(e.g., on the circumference of a cylindrical starting 
material). More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a process for producing a glass preform for 
optical fiber, which comprises a glass material and 
deposit of fine glass particles formed on the 
circumference thereof. Such a glass preform may suitably 
be used as an intermediate product particularly in the 
fabrication of an optical fiber glass preform which is 
required to have high purity. Heretofore, the so-called "outside vapor-phase 
deposition process" as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application (KOKAI) No. 73522/1973 (i.e., Sho 
48-73522), is known as a process for producing a silica 
glass (or fused silica) tube or preform for optical 
fiber. In this process, a glass tube is produced in the 
following manner. Thus, fine particles of glass such as SiO2, which may  
 
be formed by hydrolysis of a raw material such as SiCl4, 
are caused to be deposited on the circumference of carbon 
or a refractory or fire-resistant starting material such 
as silica glass or alumina rotating about its horizontal 
axis as the rotational axis. The deposition of the glass 
is stopped after a predetermined amount of the glass 
particles are deposited, and the starting material is 
pulled out to provide a tubular glass aggregate. This 
tubular glass aggregate is sintered for transparency-imparting 
vitrification under a high temperature 
atmosphere in an electric furnace so as to provide a 
transparent tubular glass. Alternatively, a glass tube or preform may also be 
formed in the following manner. In such a process, a solid optical fiber preform 
(i.e., a preform having the inside completely filled up) 
may be used as a starting material in a similar manner as 
described above to provide a complex of the starting 
material and deposit of fine glass particles formed on 
the circumference of the starting material. Then, the 
complex is subjected, without pulling out the above-mentioned 
starting material, to heat treatment in a high 
temperature furnace so as to sinter the portion of the 
deposit of fine glass particles, whereby a transparent 
glass layer is further formed on the circumference of the 
optical fiber glass preform as the starting material.  
 In addition, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 
No. 186240/1986 (i.e., Sho 61-186240) discloses another 
process. In this process,
