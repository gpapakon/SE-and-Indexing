<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA probes for 
detecting allergic diseases, and a process for detecting 
an allergic disease gene making use of such a probe, and 
more particularly to DNA probes for detecting allergic 
diseases, by which mutation in a β chain gene of an IgE 
receptor, said mutation being a diathesis of an allergic 
disease, can be detected, and a process for detecting an 
allergic disease gene making use of such a DNA probe for 
detecting an allergic disease. The DNA probes for detecting allergic diseases 
according to the present invention can be used in fields 
of genetic engineering and industries related thereto and 
are useful particularly in the gene diagnosis of an 
allergic disease. When an immune response essentially having as its 
object biophylaxis results in injury to its own vital 
tissue, such an immune reaction is called an allergic 
reaction. In general, allergic reactions are classified  
 
into 4 types of I to IV types. Of these, the allergic reaction type I is a typical 
immediate type allergy or immediate hypersensitivity. An 
antibody belonging to an IgE class strongly couples to the 
surface of a mast cell or a basophil at its Fc fragment. 
When a homologous antigen couples to such an antibody, 
chemical mediators such as histamine and leukotriene are 
released by its stimulation. Reactions such as vascular 
permeability acceleration, angiotelectasis, smooth muscle 
constriction, muciparous acceleration and leukocyte 
migration are brought about by the action of these 
chemical mediators. Such reactions are called immediate 
allergy because it only takes several minutes to several 
tens minutes from the entry of the antigen to the 
expression of symptom. More specifically, the mast cell has many granules 
to be stained with a basophilic pigment in its cytoplasm. 
These granules contain chemical mediators such as 
histamine therein. An IgE receptor having high affinity 
for IgE is present on the surface of the mast cell. 
Immunological specificity, which is a function of the mast 
cell, is determined by the IgE coupled to the IgE 
receptor. When IgE molecules coupled to the surface of 
the mast cell through the IgE receptor are crosslinked 
with a polyvalent antigen, degranulation takes place, 
whereby the symptom of an immediate type allergic reaction  
 
is caused. The basophil has basophilic granules containing 
histamine and heparin in its cytoplasm. As with the mast 
cell, an IgE receptor having high affinity for IgE is 
present on the surface of the cell,

<CLAIMS>
A DNA probe, 10-50 bases long, including a base 
sequence selected from the following formulae (1) to (5), 

and base sequences complementary thereto: 
 

and 

A DNA probe according to claim 1, which has a base 
sequence identical or complementary to a part of the base 

sequence (a single-stranded DNA) of a β chain gene of a 
human high-affinity IgE receptor. 
A DNA probe according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
additionally comprising a terminal label. 
A DNA probe according to any preceding claim, which is 
immobilised by a terminal bond to an insoluble support. 
A DNA probe according to any preceding claim, 
including the base sequence of any of SEQ ID NOS. 1 to 5. 
A process for detecting an allergic disease gene, 
which comprises the steps of: 


(a) denaturing a DNA fragment specimen containing an 
IgE receptor gene, give a single-stranded DNA fragment; 
(b) annealing the single-stranded DNA fragment with 
a DNA probe according to any preceding claim, and 

specifically coupling to a particular region of the IgE 
receptor gene, to form a conjugate of an objective DNA 

fragment and the DNA probe; 
(c) bringing the conjugate into contact with an 
insoluble support, to which a ligand specifically coupling 

to the objective DNA fragment has been immobilised, in a 
column containing the insoluble support as a stationary 

phase, to bond the conjugate to the ligand; 
(d) gradually raising the temperature of the column, 
thereby weakening the conjugate, to elute the DNA probe 

from the column, and 
(e) analysing the elution pattern thus obtained. 
A process according to claim 6, wherein the DNA 
fragment specimen (i) contains a β chain gene of a human 

high-affinity IgE receptor, or (ii) is obtainable by 
extracting a mRNA from human peripheral blood cells of a 

healthy person or an allergic patient, converting it to a 
cDNA and then subjecting the cDNA to a polymerase chain 

reaction (PCR) using a probe capable of amplifying an IgE 
receptor β chain. 
A process according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the 
ligand is a synthetic DNA, 10-100 bases long, composed of 

a base sequence of the IgE receptor β chain gene other than 
the base sequence of the DNA probe, e.g. of SEQ ID NO. 6, 

or a base sequence complementary thereto. 
A process according to any of claims 6 to 8, wherein 
the insoluble support is tresyl chloride-activated silica 

gel. 
A process according to any of claims 6 to 9, wherein 
the analysing comprises recognising an allergic disease 

gene if the dissociation temperature of the DNA probe read 
from the elution pattern is different from the 

corresponding case where a DNA fragment specimen containing 
a normal IgE receptor β chain gene is used.
