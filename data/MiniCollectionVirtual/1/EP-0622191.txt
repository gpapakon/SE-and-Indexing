<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for cleaning the wiping cylinder (1) of an intaglio printing machine, including several cleaning elements in contact with the periphery of the wiping cylinder, these being formed by brushes (4) and/or scrapers (3) as well as by means of a row of nozzles (7) ejecting a cleaning liquid, the first cleaning element (5) in contact with the surface of the cylinder is made of a textile material, preferably composed of porous synthetic fibres, in the form of a strip which is mounted, folded-back on itself, on and along a rigid support (6), so as to extend beyond the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A wiping device for an intaglio printing machine, 
comprising a wiping cylinder (1) and an installation for 

the continuous cleaning of said cylinder, this 
installation including a container (2) for receiving the 

cleaning liquid which continuously acts on the wiping 
cylinder (1) and cleaning elements in contact with the 

periphery of the wiping cylinder, comprising, in the 
direction of rotation of this cylinder, a first cleaning 

element (5), which removes the greater part of the ink 
from the wiping cylinder (1), followed, at defined 

distances, by a plurality of other elements constituted by 
brushes (4) and/or wiping blades (3), at least one row of 

nozzles (7, 8) parallel to the axis of the wiping 
cylinder, the nozzles being arranged in order to eject the 

cleaning liquid into the zone of the region of contact of 
said first cleaning element (5) with the wiping cylinder 

(1), wherein said first cleaning element (5) is made of 
textile material in the form of a web which is mounted, 

folded over on itself, on and along a rigid support (6), 
so as to extend beyond the latter. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the textile material is composed of porous 

synthetic fibers. 
The device as claimed in claims 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that the textile material has 

a thickness lying between 5 and 20 mm. 
The device as claimed in one of the claims 1 
to 3, characterized by the fact that the support (6) is 

adjustable in order to set the contact pressure between 
the web of textile material and the surface of the 

wiping cylinder (1).  
 
The device as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized by the fact that, the nozzles (8) of one 

of said rows of nozzles are directed inside the fold 
formed by the web of textile material.
