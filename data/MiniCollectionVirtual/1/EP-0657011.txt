<ABSTRACT>
Described is a burner with a housing (1) enclosing a combustion chamber and with an inlet (2) for a gas/air mixture used as fuel and an outlet (3) for the combustion gases. The combustion chamber is filled with a porous material (5) whose porosity varies along the length of the combustion chamber in such a way that the pore size increases in the direction of flow of the gas/air mixture, thus producing a critical Péclet number at a boundary surface or in a particular zone (B) of the porous material (5) for pore size and hence for flame development, a flame being able to exist at this critical Péclet number but being extinguished below it.

A burner, which is designed for a gas/air mixture as the fuel, which has a
laminar flame velocity SL due to its physical properties and the design of the

burner and is defined with reference to its specific heat c
p
, a density ρ and a
thermal conductivity λ, whereby in this burner a housing (1) is provided, which

has a combustion space with an inlet (2) for the gas/air mixture and an outlet (3)
for the exhaust gas, in which the housing (1) contains a porous material (5) with

communicating voids, the porosity of which alters along the length of the
combustion space, characterised in that the pore size increases in the direction

of flow of the gas mixture from the inlet (2) to the outlet (3), whereby for the
pore size a critical Peclet number (S
L
d
m
c
p
ρ)/λ for the flame development of the
gas/air mixture is produced by reason of the selected pore size in a zone (B) or

at a boundary surface (7) of the porous material (5) in the combustion space,
above which a flame can form and below which flame development is

suppressed, d
m
 being the equivalent diameter of the mean void in the porous
material in zone (B) or at the boundary surface (7), whereby the flame

formation on the surface (7) or in the zone (B) is determined substantially
independently of operating parameters which could result in a variation of the

critical Peclet number.
A burner as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the critical Peclet
number is 65 ± 25 and, particularly for natural gas/air mixtures, 65.
A burner as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that two first and
second zones (A, C) of different pore size are provided behind one another in

the housing (1) in the flow direction of the gas/air mixture, between which the 
boundary surface (7) is situated, the first zone (A) arranged downstream of the

inlet (2) having a Peclet number which is smaller than the critical Peclet number
and the second zone (C) further away from the inlet (2) has a Peclet number

which is larger than the critical Peclet number.
A burner as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that the first zone (A)
has a pore size which produces a Peclet number ≤ 40 and the second zone (C)

has a pore size which produces a Peclet number ≥ 90.
A burner as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
porous material is heat resistant plastic sponge, ceramic material or metal or a

metal alloy.
A burner as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the porous material
is heat resistant up to a temperature of 1500°C.
A burner as claimed in Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the porous
material is filling bodies, e.g. in the form of granular material, which can

optionally be stabilised, for instance by sintering.
A burner as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that the granular
material contains metal or ceramic material, particularly steatite, Stemalox or

Al
2
O

.
A burner as claimed in Claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the granular
material in the vicinity of the inlet (2) comprises grains of ball-like shape with a

mean diameter of 5 mm and in the subsequent region with a mean diameter ≥ 
11 mm if, at atmospheric pressure, the diameter to reach the critical Peclet

number lies between 5 and 11 mm and is, in particular, 9 mm.
A burner as claimed in Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the internal
surfaces of the voids in the porous material or the surfaces of the grains of the

granular material are coated with a catalyst material.
A burner as claimed in Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the housing
(1) has at least partially a cooling device (8).
A burner as claimed in Claim 11, characterised in that the cooling device

(8) is constructed as a cooling coil, which surrounds the housing (1) or defines
it and through which a coolant, particularly water, flows.
A burner as claimed in Claim 12, characterised in that a monitoring
device is provided which shuts off the supply of fuel into the combustion space

in the event of failure of the coolant.
A burner as claimed in Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that a cooling
device (9) is arranged for heat exchange in a region of relatively large pore

openings in the material.
A burner as claimed in Claim 14, characterised in that the cooling device
(8) of the housing (1) is connected in series with the cooling device (9) for heat

exchange.
A burner as claimed in Claim 14 or 15, characterised in that the cooling 
device (9) is itself so constructed that it acts at least partially as porous material

and/or replaces porous material.
A burner as claimed in one of Claims 14 to 16, characterised in that the
spacing of the cooling device (9) from zone (B) or the boundary surface (7)

with the critical Peclet number is at least so large that the cooling device (9)
does not come into contact with the flame.
A burner as claimed in Claims 14 to 16, characterised in that the internal
wall of the housing (1) is shielded from direct heat radiation, at least in the

flame region, by an additional device (10), for instance by means of an insert of
suitable material.
A burner as claimed in Claim 18, characterised in that the device (10) is
arranged at a spacing from the internal wall of the housing (1) which leaves free

a gap (11) which is free of the gas/air mixture.
A burner as claimed in one of Claims 14 to 18, characterised in that the
cooling device (9) is so far away from the zone with the porosity necessary for

the critical Peclet number that it does not extend into the flame region.

drain away through the outlet (3).
