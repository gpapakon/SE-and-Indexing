<ABSTRACT>
A transmission line filter comprises four resonators 
(100, 200, 300, 400), and transmission zeroes can be added to 

the transfer function of the filter using a known phasing 
coupling technique using a transmission line (53,54) coupled 

between two resonators. The location of the transmission 
zeroes can be varied using control circuits (A,B). Each 

control circuit comprises a series coupled inductance 
(55,58) and capacitance (56,59) forming a resonance 

circuit, the resonance frequency of which can be varied using 
a variable d.c. voltage (V₁ ,V₂ ). The inductance of each 

control circuit is arranged adjacent its respective 
transmission line so that the two are weakly 

electromagnetically coupled. By supplying the variable 
voltage to the resonance circuits,normal operation of the 

phasing coupling is affected, thereby varying the location of 
the transmission zero.One or more control circuits can be 

provided for filters having transmission zeroes in their 
transfer function which need to be varied.the provision of 

these control circuits allow transmission zeroes to be 
selected in situ, rather than solely during manufacture

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter comprising at 
least a first resonator and a second resonator and a 
transmission zero means coupled between the first and second 
resonators to provide a transmission zero in the transfer 
function of the filter. In data communication technology, the need often arises 
whereby a greater attenuation in certain stop band 
frequencies of a passband filter is required than what is 
achievable using a conventional passband filter. One such 
example is the filter used in the front end of a radio 
telephone. As is well known to persons skilled in the art in 
a radio telephone a received radio frequency signal is 
mixed, after the front end filter, which may be,for 
example,the receiver branch of a duplex filter, in a mixer 
with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) to provide an 
intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The frequency of the 
local oscillator signal is offset by the intermediate 
frequency from the frequency of the received signal. In a 
mixer the resultant output signals are the sum and 
difference of the local oscillator and received signal 
frequencies, with the undesirable frequencies produced being 
filtered out in an intermediate frequency filter so that 
only signals of the desired frequency remain. Thus, when 
employing a mixer no difference can be made between a 
desired received signal and a signal having the mirror (or 
image) frequency,the image frequency being that frequency 
which differs from the local oscillator (LO) frequency by 
the IF, but at the other side of the LO frequency from the 
received signal.As an example,let the local oscillator 
frequency be A MHz and the desired received signal frequency 
B MHz, this being greater than the A MHz. The intermediate 
frequency (IF) obtained as a result of the mixing is the  
 
difference between these frequencies, i.e. IF = (B - A) MHz. 
There is also the so-called image frequency which, as 
described above, is smaller than the LO frequency by the 
magnitude of the IF, so that if a signal having the image 
frequency C MHz is mixed with the LO signal, an IF signal 
having a frequency IF=(A-C) MHz results, which is the same 
as (B-A) MHz. This is illustrated in Figure 2. The IF 
filter is not capable of distinguishing between the 
frequencies (B-A) and (A-C), although only the signal of 
frequency (B-A) is wanted. Because of this, the image 
frequency signal C has to be filtered in the front end 
filter before the mixer, so that it will not be coupled to 
the mixer, and only the signal of
