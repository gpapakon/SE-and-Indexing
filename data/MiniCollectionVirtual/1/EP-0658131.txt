<ABSTRACT>
Attrition reclaimed ester-cured phenolic resin bonded sand is subject to thermal treatment prior to re-use. Prior to the thermal treatment, however, the attrition reclaimed sand is contacted with an additive which converts potassium compounds to a form having a melting point of at least 550  C and the thermal treatment is effected at a temperature below that at which the resulting potassium compound fuses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the reclamation of foundry 
sands from used foundry moulds which have been fabricated by 
bonding foundry sand with ester-cured phenolic resin binders. There is an increasing demand to recycle foundry 
sands from moulds after casting. The demand is fuelled not 
only by the cost of virgin sand but also by the problems 
associated with the disposal of the used resin coated sand. 
In the past such material was readily disposed of in land 
fill sites but recently the authorities have become more 
environmentally conscious and in many regions there are 
strict regulations governing the disposal of such materials. One known method of sand reclamation comprises 
attrition of the bonded sand to break up the agglomerates 
into individual particles. Whilst the attrition process may 
remove some resin from the sand particles by abrasion which 
will be removed with the fines, resin remains on the surface 
of sand particles and the re-bonding properties of the 
attrition reclaimed sand are inferior to the bonding 
properties of new sand. Generally, conventional attrition 
techniques allow re-use of up to 85% of the resin bonded 
sand, the remaining sand being dumped. Known thermal techniques for reclaiming foundry sand 
after attrition comprise heating the sand in a fluidised bed 
to a sufficiently high temperature to remove the organic  
 
resin effectively and to ensure low emissions from the 
exhaust gas. However, it has been found that such a thermal 
reclamation process is not particularly successful with 
ester-cured bonded foundry sands because there is a tendency 
for the sand grains to agglomerate in the thermal reclaimer 
preventing efficient operation of the fluidised bed at 
temperatures high enough to remove the binder effectively and 
ensure low emissions. At low temperatures there is 
inefficient removal of the resin. Sand reclaimed by the 
known thermal techniques exhibits re-bonding properties 
inferior to new sand and comparable to sand reclaimed by 
attrition. It is believed the problem of agglomeration in the 
thermal reclamation system is due to the presence of 
potassium in the resin binder system which is generally in 
the form of potassium hydroxide and associated ester salts. 
It is postulated that the potassium compounds decompose 
and/or melt during the thermal treatment which results in 
agglomeration of sand particles, the particles being bonded 
or attracted to each other to such an extent that the 
fluidising gas is unable to maintain an effective fluidised 
be

<CLAIMS>
A process comprising the thermal treatment of 
attrition reclaimed ester-cured phenolic resin bonded sand 

characterised in that prior to the thermal treatment the 
attrition reclaimed sand is contacted with an additive which 

converts potassium compounds to a form having a melting point 
of at least 550째C and the thermal treatment is effected at a 

temperature below that at which the resulting potassium 
compound fuses. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 in which the additive 
converts potassium compounds to a form having a melting point 

above 700째C. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which 
the additive is contacted with the sand in the form of an 

aqueous solution. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the additive is selected from one or more of halogen acids, 

sulphuric acid, boric acid and ammonium salts of these acids. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which 
the additive is in the form of a powdered solid. 
A process as claimed in Claim 5 in which the additive 
is a calcium compound.  

 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the additive is used in an amount of at least 0.25% by weight 

of the attrition reclaimed sand. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the additive is used in an amount in the range from 0.5 to 5% 

by weight of attrition reclaimed sand. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the thermal treatment is conducted at a temperature of 600 to 

1000째C. 
A process as claimed in Claim 9 in which the thermal 
treatment is conducted at a temperature of 700 to 800째C.
