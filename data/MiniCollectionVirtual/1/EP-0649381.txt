<ABSTRACT>
A package for sparking plugs (40) consists of a packaging material blank (10) which is folded into two hollow sides (24, 25) accommodating the sparking plugs (40), an intermediate piece (30) forming one piece with the hollow sides (24, 25) and a strip (25) shaped on one hollow side (25) so that the same side of the packaging material blank (10) always faces outwards. A cover (46) or a sleeve (56) is fitted over the hollow sides (24, 25) and the intermediate piece (30) to prevent theft. The sparking plugs (40) can easily be checked and removed by means of windows (50, 57) and tear-strips (52, 59) bounded by perforations (51, 58).

Pack for at least one sparking-plug (40) made from a board blank (10) with a
flat back panel (12), a front panel (13) and two hollow walls (24, 25) formed

by the front panel (13) that have sides (27, 31) located opposite each other
with openings (37, 38) to accommodate the end sections (62, 63) of the

sparking-plugs (40), where the two sides (27, 31) of the hollow walls (24, 25)
that are located opposite each other are connected by an intermediate section

(30) which is connected to these hollow walls (24, 25) in a single-piece
configuration and where the front panel (13) is provided with a flap (34) that

projects from one end of one hollow wall (25) and is bonded securely to a
projecting section of the back panel (12), 
wherein
 side flaps (14) are
integrated with the back panel (12) and are located at an angle to the ends (47)

of the hollow walls (24, 25) and 
wherein
 a lid (46) or a sleeve (56) covers the
hollow walls (24, 25) and the intermediate section (30), with the lid (46) or the

sleeve (56) being bonded securely to the side flaps (14).
Pack according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the lid (46) or the sleeve (56) is provided
with a window (50, 57) that extends (height H) from a section (33) of the front

panel (13) that is parallel to the back panel (12) to the point at which the side
(27) projecting at right angles from the intermediate section (30) changes to a

further section (28) that is parallel to the back panel (12). 
Pack according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 one of the two sides (27, 31) of the
hollow walls (24, 25) that are located opposite each other projects at right

angles from the intermediate section (30) and forms a pocket (41) to hold the
sparking-plug (40) securely (42) and 
wherein
 the other of the two sides (27,
31) projects away from the intermediate section obliquely.
Pack according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein
 the openings (37, 38) provided in
the two sides (27, 31) located opposite each other continue in the sections (28,

33) of the hollow walls (24, 25) that are parallel to the back panel (12).
Pack according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 at least one tear tab
(52, 59) defined by perforations (51, 58) is located in the section of the lid

(46) or sleeve (56) that limits the window (50, 57) at the level of the pocket
(41) for the sparking-plug (40).
Pack according to claim 5, 
wherein
 a window (55, 60) that exposes the
electrode (54) of the sparking-plug (40) is located in the tear tab (52, 59).
