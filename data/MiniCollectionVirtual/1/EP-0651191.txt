<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic control valve, comprising a 
two position valve body adapted to be shifted - by means of a rotary 

movement of an actuating shaft - from one operative position to the 
other. According to the invention the shaft of the valve body carries 

a drive wheel segment extending through an arc that corresponds to the 
shift angle of the valve body, said wheel segment being in drive 

connection with the actuating shaft, spring means being provided to 
bias - at least in the final stage of a rotary shift movement in 

either direction - said wheel segment in de direction opposite to the 
shift direction. This enables the valve body to be shifted from one 

working position into the other in a reliable manner, by simply 
reversing the direction of rotation of an available rotating drive 

shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic control valve with a shaft, 
comprising a two position valve body adapted to be shifted - by means 
of a rotary movement of an actuating shaft - from one operative 
position to the other. Such control valves are commonly known. In most cases a control 
valve is involved, which is placed within a hydraulic circuit and 
comprises a housing with a pressure connection, a return connection 
and two service connections for a hydraulic piston cylinder device, a 
valve body of the rotary spool type being mounted within said housing 
for a manual angular movement through a limited angle. In such cases 
the actuating shaft coincides with the shaft of the valve body. 
Dependent on the actual operative position of the valve body 
pressurized fluid is supplied to one end of the connected hydraulic 
piston cylinder device, while the other end of the device is connected 
to the hydraulic fluid reservoir. It is an object of the invention to provide a hydraulic valve 
body of the type referred to hereinabove, the valve body of which is 
adapted to be shifted by a shaft that may be driven in two opposite 
directions. According to the invention this object is achieved in that the 
shaft of the valve body carries a drive wheel segment extending 
through an arc that corresponds to the shift angle of the valve body, 
said wheel segment being in drive connection with the actuating shaft, 
spring means being provided to bias - at least in the final stage of a 
rotary shift movement in either direction - said wheel segment 
opposite to the shift direction. At the end of a rotary shift 
movement, by which the valve body has moved from one position onto the 
other, a force is thus acting on said wheel segment in a direction 
opposite to the preceding rotary shift movement tending to keep said 
wheel segment in (slipping) engagement with said actuating shaft that 
may continue to rotate in the same direction. This secures that the 
wheel segment will be taken along by the actuating shaft when it is 
desired to reverse the shift direction so as to place the valve into 
the other operative position. Preferably the wheel segment is mounted on the shaft of the 
valve body in such a way, that it may perform a slight lost motion 
around said shaft. This lost motion, which need to be a fraction of 
the angular shift movement only, has the advantage that the spring  
 
energy collected at the end of the preceding shift movement is 
completely utilized for initiating a shift movement in the

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic control valve, comprising a two position valve body (12) with 
a shaft adapted to be shifted - by means of a rotary movement of an actuating 

shaft (1) - from one operative position to the other, characterized in 
that the shaft of the valve body (12) carries a drive wheel segment (22) 

extending through an arc that corresponds to the shift angle of the 
valve body (12), said wheel segment (22) being in drive connection with the 

actuating shaft (1), spring means (26, 27) being provided to bias - at least in the 
final stage of a rotary shift movement 

of said valve body (12) in either direction - said 
wheel segment (22) in a direction opposite to the shift direction. 
A hydraulic control valve according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the wheel segment (22) is mounted on the shaft of the valve body (12) in 

such a way, that it may perform a slight lost motion around the said 
shaft. 
A hydraulic control valve according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the wheel segment (22) is formed as a gear segment, that 

cooperates with a gear or pinion (21) on the actuating shaft (1).
