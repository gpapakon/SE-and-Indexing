<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to storage batteries, and more particularly to an 
improved battery cell structure. One known battery battery cell structure includes a monoblock 
separator forming a honeycomb type structure that defines an 8 X 8 matrix 
of compartments, each including a lead wire current collector. The lead wire 
current collectors comprise a plurality of lead wires, some of the lead wires 
being coated with a positive paste of an active material and the other lead 
wires being coated with a negative paste of an active material. The lead 
wire coatings are produced by dipping precut wires, which are 1 mm. to 1.5 
mm. in diameter and 100 mm. to 200 mm. in length, into a supply of the 
positive or negative paste to form lead wire elements having a square cross 
section which is 2.5 mm. to 3 mm on each side. One disadvantage of this battery structure is that the monoblock 
separator is very expensive to produce and its honeycomb structure 
complicates the process of inserting the current collectors into the 
compartments of the monoblock, particularly because of the relative small 
size of the current collectors. Moreover, production of the current collectors 
is difficult because it is hard to control the thickness of the coating using  
 
known coating processes, such as a dipping process. The thickness of the 
coating must be controlled to provide proper operation of the battery cell. 
Also, the electrode dipping process is very time consuming. This battery 
structure requires careful control of electrode manufacture and insertion, and 
the manufacturing process requires repetitive handling of large numbers of 
individual small wire electrodes. The present invention provides a novel battery cell including at least 
one, and preferably a plurality of flat plate-like support members, having a 
plurality of parallel, closely spaced ribs which define a plurality of 
longitudinally extending grooves on one surface of the support member. 
Alternating ones of the grooves of the support member are pasted with a 
positive paste of an active material and the remaining the grooves are 
pasted with a negative paste of an active material. A current collector lead 
wire is positioned in each of the grooves, embedded in the paste and 
centrally located within the groove. The ends of the lead wires that are 
embedded in the positive paste extend beyond the support member at a first 
end thereof and are connected together forming a positive lead termination. 
Similarly, the ends of the lead wires that are
