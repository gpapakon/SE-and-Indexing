System consisting of an automotive vehicle, preferably golf
cart, and a transmitter, the vehicle comprising a drive means,

a control means, and a high-frequency position finder with the
aid of which the vehicle can approach the transmitter automatically,
characterized in

that said transmitter sends high-frequency signals and ultrasonic
signals, and that said position finder comprises a high-frequency

position finder (2, 7) which is active between said
vehicle and said transmitter at a distance exceeding a predetermined

distance so as to determine the direction of said transmitter,
and an ultrasonic position finder (3, 8) which is active

whenever said vehicle is within the predetermined distance from
said transmitter to determine the direction of said transmitter

and the respective distance therefrom.
The system according to claim 1,

characterized in that said predetermined distance is the distance
over which ultrasonic signals can be received for controlling

said vehicle.
The system according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that in the ready state of said vehicle the
control means (6) thereof detects whether ultrasonic signals are

received.
The system according to claim 3,

characterized in that in the case where no ultrasonic signals
are received said control means (6) of said vehicle activates

said high-frequency position finder for performing a position
finding operation. 
The system according to any of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that said high-frequency position finder comprises
a high-frequency reception antenna (7) which is stationarily

mounted on said Vehicle and that the high-frequency position
finding operation is performed such that said drive means

(10) rotates said vehicle by at least 360Â°.
The system according to any of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that said high-frequency position finder has at
least three antennae with the aid of which a Doppler position

finding operation is performed.
The system according to any of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that said control means (6) controls said drive
means (10) of said vehicle in such a manner that after the high-frequency

position finding operation the vehicle moves in a
straight line in the determined direction until it passes either

into the ultrasonic reception range or is again place in readiness
by said control means (6).
The system according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that two ultrasonic receiving means (8) which
are spaced apart in the transverse direction of said vehicle and

whose reception signals are continuously evaluated by a processor
(6) mounted on said vehicle in such a manner that the direction

and the distance from the transmitter are respectively
determined are secured to the vehicle.
The system according to claim 8,

characterized in that said processor (6) controls said drive
means such that said vehicle follows said transmitter until a

predetermined minimum distance from said transmitter has been
reached. 
The system according to any of claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that said vehicle comprises a free-running
front wheel which is supported to pivot freely about a vertical

axis, and two rear wheels which are drivable by two electric
motors which can be controlled independently of each other.
The system according to any of claims 1 to 10,

characterized in that said drive means (10) is controlled such
that it drives said vehicle, which is approaching in a straight

line, at a greater speed in the high-frequency position finding
range than in the ultrasonic position finding range.
The system according to any of claims 1 to 11,

characterized in that an infrared detector (9) which is oriented
in the traveling direction is also arranged.
