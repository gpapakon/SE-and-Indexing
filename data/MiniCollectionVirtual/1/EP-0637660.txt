<ABSTRACT>
The device prevents the component lifting off the scaffolding, having a gravity-operated locking tongue (3) inclined downwards. The tongue protrudes from an inclined rotary spindle (2) towards the scaffolding cross-member (5). The bearings (4) are offset in the length-wise direction in the frame-member (7) of the component equipped with the support hook (6) for the latter. The spindle is in a plane parallel to that of the hook, which is at right angles to the frame-member, and slopes towards the cross-member (5). The tongue passes through a slot (9) in the frame-member, engaging under the cross-member.

An anti-lifting lock for hook connection in a scaffold in which a frame-like scaffold 
floor part (8) is hooked to a tubular cross bar (5) by means of bearing hooks (6) and is locked by 

the gravity-driven locking element (1) to this cross bar (5),
 
with the locking element (1) being provided with a lock tongue (3) which is arranged such that 

the locking element (1) is oriented downwards at a sufficient angle,
 
wherein 


a U-section whose open side points to the opposite direction of the cross bar (5), is used as the 
frame member (7) of the scaffold floor part (8), 
the locking element (1) consists of a swivelling axle (2) which is inclined in the direction of the 
web (11) ) of the frame member (7) and to which a lock tongue (3) is attached which is oriented 

away from the shaft (2) in the direction of the cross bar (5), 
 
and where bearings (4) being displaced in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the scaffold 

floor part (8) are provided which are located on the frame member (7) with the bearing hooks (6) 
of the scaffold floor part (8) to incline and guide the locking element (1), 


and the axle (2) with the lock tongue (3) is positioned by means of the bearings (4) in a plane 
parallel to the bearing hooks (6) which are arranged at right angles to the frame member (7), 

with the axle (2) being inclined in the direction of the web (11) of the frame member(7) and the 
lock tongue (3) protruding through a slot-like hole (9) in the frame member (7) so that it grips the 

cross bar (5) from beneath. 
The anti-lifting lock of Claim 1,
 
wherein the inclined axle (5) is guided by two bearings (4) arranged at the front side frame 

member (7) of the scaffold floor part (8) and laying in a plane which is vertical under fitted 
conditions. 
The anti-lifting lock of Claim 1 or 2,
 
wherein the lock tongue (3) is attached at an approximately right angle to the axle (2) and points, 

under fitted conditions, tangentially to the lower surface of the tubular cross bar (5). 
The anti-lifting lock of any one of the Claims 1 to 3,
 
wherein 


the two shorter legs of the U-section (10) of the frame member (7) are horizontally positioned  
 

on the top and on the bottom, and the wider web (11) of the U-section which carries the bearing 
hooks (6), is positioned vertically, 
to reach the inclined position, the upper bearing (4) of the locking element (1) is provided in the 
upper third of the web (11), and the lower bearing (4) in the border region of the lower leg of the 

U-section (10), 
and to ensure that the lock tongue (3) is free to move, a slot-like hole (9) is provided in the 
lower third of the web (11). 
The anti-lifting lock of Claim 4,
 
wherein the lengths of the legs of U-section (10) and the web (11) are in 1:2 ratio. 
The anti-lifting lock of any one of the Claims 1 to 5,
 
wherein the lateral dimensions of the slot-like hole (9) allow the lock tongue (3) to oscillate to the 

inner side, that is the side of the frame member (7) being opposite to the bearing hooks (6). 
The anti-lifting lock of any one of the Claims 1 to 6,
 
wherein to support the axle (2), a spring is provided in one of the two bearings (4).
