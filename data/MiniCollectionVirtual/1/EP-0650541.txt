<ABSTRACT>
The following invention relates to a process for bleaching pulp, in which, after defibration, a first filtrate (2) containing metals, principally in ionic form, is separated off from pulp, in which the separated metals are supplied to a certain fibre quantity (1), which adsorbs the metals, which fibre quantity, during its further treatment, is at least not significantly negatively affected by the presence of the metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for bleaching 
pulp preferably comprising several bleaching stages, in 
which at some stage after defibration a first filtrate 
containing metals, principally in ionic form, is separated 
off, in which the metals are first separated from a pulp 
stream and the pulp stream is subsequently bleached, in 
which, in a preferred case, the metals are reintroduced to 
the fibre stream from which they had been separated. Using 
the invention, a problem, which is otherwise difficult to 
solve, namely the problem of catering for released metals, 
is solved in a very simple manner. The environmental authorities are placing ever greater 
demands on the pulp industry to decrease the use of 
chlorine gas for bleaching. Permitted discharges of 
organic chlorine compounds (AOX) with the waste water from 
bleaching plants have been gradually decreased and are now 
at such a low level that the pulp factories have in many 
cases stopped using chlorine gas. Instead, only chlorine 
dioxide is used as a bleaching agent. Chlorine dioxide 
forms smaller quantities of AOX than chlorine gas while 
achieving the same bleaching effect. However, even the use of chlorine dioxide has been 
questioned. On the one hand, the environmental authorities 
in certain countries demand that the discharges of organic 
chlorine compounds be reduced to such a low level that 
these demands can scarcely be met even if only chlorine 
dioxide is used for bleaching. On the other hand,  
 
customers in many countries have begun to demand paper 
products which are bleached entirely without using either 
chlorine gas or chlorine dioxide. The pulp industry is therefore searching for methods which 
permit bleaching of pulp without using chlorine chemicals. 
Methods which have been successfully tested involve 
removing metals in an acid stage (A), as described in DE-A-3 302 580, or possibly by 
addition of chelating agents (Q), e.g. EDTA, to an oxygen-delignified 
pulp, as described in EP-A-0 456 626. The pulp is washed and is further 
bleached using, for example, hydrogen peroxide (P) and/or 
ozone (Z) in different sequences. One example is the 
method which is described in SE-A-8902058 (EKA NOBEL), the 
so-called Lignox method. Another known bleaching process 
includes the bleaching sequences AZ (EOP) where A is an 
acid stage without chelating agent. It is a significant feature of these different methods 
that certain metal ions have a negative effect on the 
bleaching process in the form of impaired pulp quality

<CLAIMS>
Process for bleaching pulp in which, after 
defibration, a first filtrate containing metals, principally 

in ionic form, is separated off, preferably by means 
of acidification, from pulp, characterised in that the 

separated metals are supplied to a certain fibre quantity 
which adsorbs the metals, which fibre quantity, during its 

further treatment, is at least not significantly 
negatively affected by the presence of the metals. 
Process according to Patent Claim 1, characterised 
in that the filtrate, after being freed of the metals, is 

supplied to the process, preferably at an earlier stage, 
so that the possibility is realised of completely closing 

the bleaching plant. 
Process according to Patent Claim 1, characterised 
in that the said fibre quantity is assigned to one and the 

same flow line, and that the metals which have been 
separated out of the flow line are supplied to the same 

flow line at a later stage, after the sequence in which 
the metals are not wanted. 
Process according to Patent Claim 1, characterised 
in that there are several parallel flow lines for fibres 

and that the metals are selectively supplied to one or 
more of the said lines. 
Process according to Patent Claim 4, characterised 
in that at least one flow line with bleached pulp is not 

supplied with the metals. 
Process according to Patent Claim 5, characterised 
in that the metals are supplied to a flow line containing  

 
unbleached fibres. 
Process according to Patent Claim 3, characterised 
in that the bleaching sequence during which the metals are 

not wanted contains at least one EO stage. 
Process according to Patent Claim 3 or 7, 
characterised in that the bleaching sequence during which 

the metals are not wanted contains at least one hydrogen 
peroxide bleaching stage (P). 
Process according to Patent Claim 3, 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the bleaching sequence during which 

the metals are not wanted contains at least one ozone 
bleaching stage (Z). 
Process according to Patent Claim 6, characterised 
in that pulp components with different metal contents are 

employed in the manufacture of multi-layered paper so that 
metals are not present in at least one of the outside 

layers and in which the metals are preferably present in 
an intermediate layer.
