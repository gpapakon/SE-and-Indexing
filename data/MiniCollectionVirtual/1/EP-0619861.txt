<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a shock absorber (1) which is provided with a fastener device (70) for attachment of the absorber to a supportive surface (100) to be protected against the shock of impact forces. The shock absorber (1) includes an external element (10) and a shock absorbing bar (20) which is accommodated in an aperture (15) in the external element. The external element (10) also includes an aperture for accommodating the fastener device (70). The shock absorbing bar (20) is made of an impact absorbing material and is provided with recesses (21-26). The invention also relates to the use of an inventive shock absorber and also to a method of making subsequent adjustments thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shock absorber of the kind defined in the preamble 
of Claim 1. The invention also relates to use of the inventive shock absorber 
and to a method of making adjustments thereto. There is a great need for different types of shock absorbers which will function 
to protect apparatus and devices which are subject to sudden impact forces, 
for instance devices which are subjected to shock forces caused by loading goods 
thereonto. Such devices will include the loading baskets of mining trucks, transporters, 
saw mill materials handling equipment, loading and offloading piers, 
ramps, and so on. In US-A-3574379 there is disclosed a shock-absorbing device comprising a bumper 
pad including a tubular casing of flexible plastic material. The casing is filled 
with resilient, spongy, cellular foam material saturated with a liquid. The device 
flexes yieldably when subjected to moderate impact, but on severe impact the 
device is designed to be destroyed and liquid released at a controlled rate. This 
is a device which is strictly restricted for use in automobile bumpers, where 
severe impact occurs only at accidents. The object of the present invention is to provide a particularly effective shock 
absorber which can be used in a number of different connections. This object 
is achieved with an shock absorber having the characteristic features 
set forth in the characterizing clause of respective following in dependent claims. At least one of the bars of the shock absorber can be replaced, so as 
to enable the shock absorber to be adjusted from case to case and therewith 
meet current requirements. The external elements of the shock absorber can be standardized and the centre 
body or the shock absorbing bars can be varied so as to impart to the shock absorber 
those properties that are required on that particular occasion.  
 The external elements of the shock absorber are conveniently made 
of impact resistant and wear resistant rubber or plastic material, whereas the 
centre body protected by said external elements is  
 
conveniently made from a relatively soft rubber or 
plastic material which has good impact absorbing 
properties. The invention will now be described in more detail 
with reference top exemplifying embodiments thereof 
and also with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which Figures 1 to 3 are cross-sectional views of 
three different embodiments of the inventive shock 
absorber, showing the absorber mounted on a supportive 
surface. The shock absorber
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A shock absorber (1;1';1") having an external element (10;10';10") made 
on an impact and wear resistant rubber or plastic material and an internal shock 

absorbing bar (20;20';20") made of a material providing an impact absorbing 
effect, the absorber further including a fastener device (70) for attachment of 

the absorber to a supportive surface (100) to be protected against the shock of 
impact forces, whereby the shock absorbing bar (20;20';20") is arranged in an 

elongated, canalformed aperture (15;34;50;51) inside the external element 
characterized 
in
 that said internal shock absorbing bar (20;20';20") is loosely 
accomodated so as to allow replacement of the same. 
A shock absorber according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that 
the external element (10;10';10") also includes an aperture (15,16;31) for accomodating 

the fastener device (70). 
A shock absorber according to claim 1 or 2, 
chacterized in
 that 
the shock absorbing bar (20;20';20") is provided with recesses or cavities (21-26; 

60). 
A shock absorber according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in
 
that the aperture (15,16;31) for accomodating the fastener device (70) has two 

oblique abutment surfaces (17,18;32,33) ofr coaction with said fastener device. 
A shock absorber according to any one of claims 2-4, 
characterized
 
in that the connector (35;52) which is located between the aperture 

(34;50,51) which accommodates the shock absorbing bar (20';20") and the aperture 
(31) which accommodates the fastener device (70). 
A shock absorber according to any one of claims 1-5, 
characteried 
in
 that the external element (10") has a vertical connection (53) which is located 
between two apertures (50,51) which accommodate shock absorbing bars (20").  

 
A shock absorber according to any one of claims 1-6, 
characterized 
in
 that the external element (10') is provided with a slide layer (40) on the 
upper surface thereof. 
The use of a shock absorber according to any one of claims 1-7, 
characterized 
in
 that a number of shock absorber (1;1';1") are mounted on 
a supportive surface (100) to be protected from impact shock, with the side edges 

(13,14) of neighbouring shock absorbers in contact with on another or lying close 
together. 
A method relating to the use of a shock absorber according to any one 
of claims 1-7 
characterized by
 substituting in use one or more of the 
shock absorber bars (20;20';20") with other bars in a manner to trim the shock 

absorbing properties of the shock absorber (1;1';1") to suit current requirements.
