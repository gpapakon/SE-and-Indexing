<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce cellulose fibres, a solution of cellulose in a tertiary amino oxide is hot-shaped into filaments, the filaments are cooled and brought into a precipitation bath in order to precipitate the dissolved cellulose. Before being brought into the precipitation bath, the shaped solution is exposed for cooling to a substantially laminar gas current.

Process for the preparation of cellulose fibres in which a 
solution of cellulose in a tertiary amine-oxide is moulded 

in a heated condition to give filaments, the filaments are 
cooled and are then introduced into a precipitation bath in 

order to precipitate the dissolved cellulose, characterised 
in that the moulded solution is cooled by exposure to an 

essentially laminar gas stream before it is introduced into 
the precipitation bath. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
the laminar gas stream is directed substantially at right 

angles to the filaments. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1 or 2 for the preparation 
of cellulose fibres, wherein the hot cellulose solution is 

led through a spinneret (1') having a multiplicity of 
spinning orifices which are arranged in an annular fashion, 

whereby an annular filament curtain (5') is formed, 
characterised in that the laminar gas stream is provided in 

the centre of the ring formed by the spinning orifices and 
is directed radially outwards. 
Device for carrying out the process according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, wherein the device includes an inlet for 

cooling gas and a spinneret (1') with spinning orifices 
which are arranged essentially in annular fashion to form 

an annular filament bundle (5'), characterised in that the 
inlet for cooling gas is provided in the centre of the ring 

formed by the arrangement of spinning orifices and the 
inlet is designed in such a way that an essentially laminar 

gas stream strikes the filaments and the filaments are 
cooled by a laminar gas stream. 
Device in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that 
the inlet for cooling gas has a pipe-shaped inlet (8) and 

a baffle plate (9) for deflecting the gas stream, whereby 
the baffle plate (9) is so arranged that the gas stream  

 
remains as laminar as possible during deflection. 
Use of a device in accordance with one of Claims 4 or 5 for 
the preparation of cellulose fibres from a solution of 

cellulose in a tertiary amine-oxide.
