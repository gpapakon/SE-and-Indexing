<ABSTRACT>
A method for supplying negative programming voltages to 
non-volatile memory cells in a non-volatile memory device 

provides for charging a capacitor (C;C1-Cn) to a positive high 
voltage by connecting, through first switching means 

(TX,TY;TE1-TEn,TF1-TFn), a first plate (A;A1-An) of the 
capacitor (C;C1-Cn) to a positive high-voltage supply (Vpp) and 

connecting, through second switching means (TB;TZ;TD1-TDn), a 
second plate (B;B';B1-Bn) of the capacitor (C;C1-Cn), which is 

also operatively connected to the control gate of at least one 
memory cell, to a reference voltage supply (GND), and for 

successively connecting, through said first switching means 
(TX,TY;TE1-TEn,TF1-TFn) the first plate (A;A1-An) of the 

capacitor (C;C1-Cn) to the reference voltage supply (GND) and 
disconnecting the second plate (B;B';B1-Bn) of the capacitor 

(C;C1-Cn) from the reference voltage supply (GND) to obtain a 
negative voltage on said second plate (B;B';B1-Bn) voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-volatile memory device comprising a structure for supplying
negative programming voltages to non-volatile memory cells in said
non-volatile memory device.It is known that EEPROM and Flash EEPROM memory devices can
be programmed in one or another of two logical states by
respectively introducing electrons into or removing electrons
from the memory cells' floating gates. This latter operation is
termed "writing" in EEPROMs, while in Flash EEPROMs it is
referred to as "erasure".The removal of electrons from a cell's floating gate is
accomplished by tunnelling electrons from the floating gate
into an underlying N+ diffusion, which in the case of a Flash
EEPROM device constitute the source region of the cell while in
an EEPROM device can represent either the source or the drain
region of the cell, through a thin oxide region called "tunnel
oxide"; electron tunnelling takes place if the potential
difference between the floating gate and said underlying
diffusion is made negative and its absolute value exceeds a
value depending on the cells' characteristics.A common technique provides for grounding the cell's
control gate (which is capacitively coupled to the floating
gate), while raising the underlying diffusion potential to a
value generally higher than 10 V.When however the diffusion potential is raised to such
values, band-to-band tunnelling causes significant leakage 
currents to appear, thereby making it impossible to program the
memory device by just supplying it one single voltage supply,
or to use the memory device in a battery-supplied environment.To overcome such a problem, a different technique has been
introduced, which provides for lowering the control gate
potential to a negative value (with respect to the ground
reference voltage) ranging from -6 V to -8 V and generated by a
circuitry internal to the memory device, and raising the
potential of the N+ diffusion under the tunnel oxide to a
moderately high value, for example corresponding to the voltage
supply value of the memory device.A circuit implementing this technique is described in the
US Patent 5,077,691, and comprises three P-channel MOSFETs, two
of which are connected in series between the output of a
positive high voltage (Vpp) source and an N-channel MOSFET
having a source connected to ground, while the third is
connected between the common node of the previous two MOSFETs
and the output of a negative high voltage (Vnn) source; the
common node to which the three MOSFETs are connected represents
a
