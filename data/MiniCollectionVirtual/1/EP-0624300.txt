<ABSTRACT>
An image processing system for providing edge enhancement of low resolution binary image files processes the low resolution bitmap data in windows to determine whether an edge transition or "kink site" occurs withing each window. The original bitmap data in the window is then replaced with edge enhanced gray scale data if a kink site is identified. The selection of the correct edge enhanced gray scale data to be used in place of the original bitmap data is based on whether the central pixel contained within the window is a black or white pixel, whether the central pixel is located on a single pixel line, and the location of the central pixel with respect to the kink site. The determination of the location of the central pixel is based on pixel values and gradient magnitudes of surrounding pixel locations. The system for performing edge enhancement of low resolution image files may employ a binarization and sorting unit (110) to sort data that is indicative of binary data from a mixed low resolution image input file. The sorted binary data is then supplied to a binary data edge enhancement processor (120) for edge enhancement processing. The output from the binary data edge enhancement processor unit is supplied to a data merger unit (130) along with the original image data. The data merger unit determines whether the original image data was part of a gray-scale image. If the data is part of a gray-scale image, the original data is supplied as the output of the processing system. Otherwise the output from the binary edge enhancement processing unit is supplied as the output of the processing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to digital
image processing and, more specifically, to a digital
image processing system for enhancing the edge
characteristics of printed or displayed images that are
generated from low resolution image files that include
binary image data alone or a mixture of binary and
gray-scale data.Edge or line jaggedness is a common problem
associated with the printing of low resolution binary
image data. Efforts have been made to reduce or
overcome line jaggedness using template matching
methods that are applied to low resolution bitmaps as
described in U.S. Patent 5,005,139 or, alternatively,
through the use of an outline extraction method like
that described in the article entitled "Image Makers",
by Henry Bortman, MacUser, November 1991, pages 98-103.
Both of the above-referenced methods use a low
resolution bitmap as an input file and both methods
perform digital processing operations on the low
resolution bitmap to produce an enhanced image output
file. The enhanced output file is supplied to the
printhead or a printer to produce a hard copy of the
image.There are disadvantages, however, to both of
the template matching and outline extraction methods of
edge enhancement discussed above. In the template
matching method, the number of templates that can be
employed must be limited in order to maintain
acceptable processing speeds. If a pattern within the
bitmap data contained in the input file does not happen
to match one of the available templates, an edge
resolution enhancement operation cannot be performed 
regardless of the quality of the image that will be
produced from the input data. In the outline
extraction method, variable dot sizes are used to "fill
in" and match a character's outline. The fill in
process, however, can be difficult when small fonts are
employed. In addition, the outline extraction method
tends to broaden thin graph lines that are spaced close
together which results in the merger of multiple lines
and a perceivable reduction in the resolution of the
printed image. U.S.-A-5 029 108 discloses an image-processing apparatus and method for
grey scale enhancement of binary image data. The method uses a multitude of stored
gradient masks each associated with a type of pixel edge pattern. A matrix of image
data pixels including the central pixel or pixel under consideration for enhancement is
convolved with each gradient mask. Each convolution operation yields a number.
Each gradient mask is associated with a specific number. Thus, if the matrix is
convolved
