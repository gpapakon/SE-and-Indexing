<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical recording medium comprising a readout 
layer and a recording layer has a relationship that an 

external magnetic field H1 is smaller than an external 
magnetic field H4, where the H1 is a minimum external 

magnetic field necessary to make a magnetization direction 
of the readout layer direct to the direction reverse to a 

magnetization direction of the recording layer 
substantially at the room temperature, and the H4 is a 

maximum external magnetic field necessary to make the 
magnetization direction of the readout layer direct to the 

direction same as the magnetization direction of the 
recording layer at an high temperature not lower than a 

predetermined temperature. Moreover, the magneto-optical 

disk is provided, between the readout layer and the 
recording layer, with an intermediate layer which inhibits 

an effective bias magnetic field from the recording layer to 
the readout layer at the room temperature. Since it is 

possible to reproduce only the information in the high-temperature 
area close to the center of the laser beam 

irradiated during reproducing, recording density is 
improved. Furthermore, since an initializing magnetic field 

at reproducing is not necessary and the reproducing 
magnetic field can be made smaller, the apparatus can be 

made smaller and the electric power consumption can be  
 

decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical
recording medium to be adopted in magneto-optical recording
devices, such as a magneto-optical disk, a magneto-optical
tape, a magneto-optical card, etc. and method of reproducing
magneto-optical information using such a recording medium.A magneto-optical disk is developed as a rewritable
optical disk, and some kind of it is already in practice as
an external memory for a computer.In a magneto-optical disk using a perpendicular
magnetization film as a recording medium, recording and 
reproducing is practiced using light, so recording capacity
can be larger than a floppy disk and a hard disk which use
an in-plane magnetization film.A recording density of a magneto-optical disk is limited
by the size of a light beam spot on the magneto-optical
disk. In short, when a diameter of a recording bit and a
distance of the recording bits are smaller than the diameter
of the light beam spot, plural recording bits get into the
light beam spot, so the recording bits cannot be reproduced
separately.Therefore, in order to improve the recording density,
the diameter of the light beam spot needs to be small, and
it is effective to make a wave length of a laser beam used
as a reproducing light beam short for this purpose. However,
the shortest wave length of a semiconducter laser beam in
present market is 680 nm, and a semiconducter laser with
shorter wave length is being developed and not served yet.
Accordingly, it is difficult to improve a recording density
with a conventional magneto-optical disk.Compared with this, for example, Jap.Jour.Appl.Phys.,Vol
31(1992)pp.568-575 discloses a magneto-optical disk which
is arranged laminated with a readout layer and a recording
layer which show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
respectively. In the journal two methods (RAD and FAD) are
proposed which reproduce a recording bit from an area 
smaller than a laser beam spot, using the above-described
magneto-optical disk.The methods use a phenomenon that laser beam irradiation
raises a temperature of an irradiated area and causes a
temperature distribution that the closer it is to a center
of the laser spot, the higher the temperature is. The above-described
readout layer and the recording layer are so set
as to have different magnetic properties, respectively,
between the condition where it is in a range of higher
temperatures and the condition where it is in a range of
lower temperatures than such a predetermined temperature to
distinguish a high-temperature area close to the
