<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a valve arrangement for a hydraulic delivery device, in particular for a power-steering pump, having a piston (15) which can be displaced in a pressure-dependent manner within a bore counter to the force of a spring device (helical spring (41)) and of which the outer wall - in order to form a slide valve - butts in a sealing manner against the inner wall of the bore (9), and thus the inner wall of the bore - as seen in the axial direction of the bore - seals spaced-apart mouths of ducts (37, 61) with respect to one another, which valve arrangement is characterised in that the piston is equipped with a portion which acts as a seat valve.

<CLAIMS>
A valve arrangement for a hydraulic conveying device, in particular for a power-steering
pump, with a piston (15) which is guided axially in a bore (9) and which is displaceable

inside the bore against the force of a spring device (41) as a function of
pressure [and]
 the outer wall of which rests in a sealed manner against the inner wall of
the bore so as to form a slide valve and which is provided with a portion acting as a seat

valve, so that ducts opening into the inner wall of the bore at an axial distance from one
another are sealed off by a combination of the seat valve and slide valve, 
characterized
in that
 the seat valve is formed by a control edge (65) extending on an external diameter
of the piston (15) and by a sealing ring (19, 119, 219) which is inserted in the bore (9)

and the sealing face (21, 221) of which has a first area, the internal diameter of which is
larger than the external diameter of the piston (15), and a second area, the internal diameter

of which is smaller than the external diameter of the piston (15).
A valve arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sealing face (221)
is part of a sleeve-shaped sealing ring (219) which is inserted in the bore (9) and the interior

of which is connected hydraulically to a first duct (37) opening into the inner wall of
the bore (9).
A valve arrangement according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that

the sealing face (21, 221) is part of a notional conical face which opens out in the direction
towards the piston (15).
A valve arrangement according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that

the sealing ring (219) is formed by an axial extension of a plug (23) which can be
inserted into the interior (bore 9) receiving the piston (15).
A valve arrangement according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that

the valve arrangement comprises a flow-control valve (3), and the piston (15) is part of
the said flow-control valve (3).
