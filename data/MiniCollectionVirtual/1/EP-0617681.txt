<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid
transfer system for accommodating the withdrawal of
liquid from a bulk supply for use in medical procedures.
The present invention is particularly well-suited for
use with bulk reconstituted, toxic drugs, such as
chemotherapeutic drugs.Various medical procedures require the
transfer of fluid from one fluid-containment system or
fluid-conducting system to another fluid-containment
system or fluid-conducting system. Typically, one of
the two systems includes a container for a bulk supply
of liquid, such as a bulk supply of a reconstituted,
liquid, chemotherapeutic drug. The other system, which
can be as simple as a syringe, may be connected to the
first system for only a short period of time, or
intermittently, to facilitate the withdrawal of a
desired amount or dose of the liquid for administration
or transmission to a patient.In those medical applications where the first
system includes a container for a bulk supply of a toxic
liquid, it is desirable, if not necessary, to prevent
inadvertent exposure of personnel to the toxic liquid.
For example, a hospital pharmacy may prepare highly
toxic, chemotherapeutic drugs for use in treating cancer
patients. Typically, a vial of a highly concentrated,
toxic drug is received from the pharmaceutical supplier
by the hospital pharmacy, and the hospital personnel
then admix the concentrated drug with a suitable diluent 
to provide a bulk reconstituted supply having a reduced
concentration or effective dose per unit volume that
permits the administration of a prescribed amount or
volume directly to the patient.The preparation of the bulk reconstituted,
liquid drug is typically carried out in a protective
environment, such as in a laminar flow hood which is
specially designed to maintain a negative pressure
within the hood so as to prevent the escape of toxic
vapors.The bulk reconstituted, liquid drug is usually
stored in a suitable container which may be a flexible,
thermoplastic, sealed bag. A suitable discharge
structure, dispensing structure, or fitment is typically
provided on the bulk container to accommodate withdrawal
of a desired amount of the liquid from the container.
It is, of course, desirable to ensure that the means for
withdrawing a prescribed amount of the toxic liquid drug
will not result in spills or leaks from the bulk
container.EP-A- 225 861 describes a transfer device comprising
two sealable plastic bags, one of which is intended to
enclose a vessel from which a substance is to be transferred
and an end of
