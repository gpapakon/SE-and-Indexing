<ABSTRACT>
Actuating device for seat-supports for chairs, particularly for swivel chairs, in which the clamping and releasing of a part which is pivotable with respect to a fixed part is effected by means of lamellae which are subjected to force and which are rotatably anchored on one part without play and on the other part with play, the locking force pressing the lamellae ends anchored with play against a lateral inner wall of one of the parts, and the releasing of the lamellae being effected by means of at least one actuating lever counteracting the locking force. The lamellae ends anchored with play are further hung via bores on a bolt which is displaceable counter to a spring force bringing about the locking force horizontally and transversely with respect to the lamellae in the part receiving the clamping and, on the side facing away from the side wall at which the clamping is effected, is slidingly received in a pressure sleeve, the diameter of which is larger than the bores of the lamellae, the bolt furthermore being equipped behind the pressure sleeve with a stop which bears against the pressure sleeve during active clamping and on its other side is passed through the wall at which the clamping is effected and is equipped externally, at a distance from this wall, with a bearing for a compression spring which acts between the bolt and the wall, presses the bolt outwards and directs the locking force onto the lamellae via the pressure sleeve connected to the bolt by virtue of the fact that the associated actuating lever is pivotably mounted externally on the side wall through which the bolt emerges in a support capable of being firmly anchored to the wall, the actuating lever finally bearing against the bolt end by way of a pressure nose and, in the event of a movement about its pivot axis, moving the bolt counter to the force of the compression spring transversely and horizontally with respect to the lamellae.
