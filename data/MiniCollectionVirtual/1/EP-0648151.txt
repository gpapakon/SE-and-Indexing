<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and an associated device for grading hard-gelatin or soft-gelatin capsules, made from starch or another material, into sound (2) and defective (3) capsules. The capsules are fed by feed devices (90) from a feed hopper (80) to capsule holders (70) in a testing station (5). The capsules (2, 3) are conveyed in the capsule holders (70) through individual testing points (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) in the testing station (5), where they are examined on all sides by cameras (21, 31, 32, 33). The images recorded by the cameras are processed using computer programmes designed to determine manufacturing defects in the capsules. The defective capsules (3) are then ejected from the testing station (5) separately from the sound capsules (2).
