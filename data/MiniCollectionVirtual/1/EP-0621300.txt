<ABSTRACT>
Polyanhydroaspartic acid whose hydrolysates exhibit a biodegradability in natural environment of at least 90% +/- 5%, characterised in that it contains not more than 3% of NH groups of its imide units relative to all the CH groups of its succinimide units. Its hydrolysates are characterised in that they contain not more than 3% of primary amide groups relative to the secondary amide groups included in the aspartic units. Polyanhydroaspartic acid and its hydrolysates can be obtained by thermal polymerisation of aspartic acid followed by optional hydrolysis, the said polymerisation operation being carried out in the presence of a boron derivative containing at least one B-OH bond or of a precursor of the said boron derivative. The latter can be employed as a "builder" or "cobuilder" in detergent compositions.
