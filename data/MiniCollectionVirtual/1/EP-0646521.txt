<ABSTRACT>
An improved curved-plate, double-hull tanker 
construction is provided, having reduced or eliminated 

transverse reinforcing structure in its midbody (224), 
except for bulkheads (210). The hull, though double, can 

compare in weight to conventional single hulls, despite 
being entirely made of mild steel plate. It is made of 

significantly fewer pieces, with a reduction in welding 
footage. More of the steel is used in the form of plate 

(24, 54), rather than more expensive shapes. Improved 
productivity is possible, resulting from standardization of 

parts, less scrap, greater use of jigs and fixtures, 
automated welding, blast-cleaning and painting, so that not 

so much staging is needed, the work environment can be 
safer, and the product can be produced at a lower unit 

labor cost. Preferably, cathodic epoxy painting (124, 126) 
is used for durability and reduction in problems due to 

blast cleaning, solvent evaporation and generation of 
refuse. Extending the double hull structure (236) from the 

bottom and sides of the hull to the main deck can provide 
space for fuel oil to be located safely away from the skin 

of the ship, rather than in possibly vulnerable deep tanks 
at the stern. The constructional technique is believed to 

be applicable to vessel hulls (236) in the 70,000 DWT to 
300,000 DWT range. The vessel hull midbody module 

subassemblies (182) may be assembled into modules (212), 
hull midbodies (224) and vessels (236).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification contains some 
subject matter in common with the specification of 
EP91311834.5 (EP-A-0,507,034). The present invention relates to a module 
structure for a vessel. In the Applicant's copending 
application No. 91304788 (EP-A-0,460,851) there is 
disclosed apparatus and a method for constructing a 
novel double-hulled product, which as panels, modules 
and midbodies, are useful in the construction of 
vessels, in particular, bulk carriers for crude oil 
and other products. The present invention relates to 
improvements in the products disclosed in 
the above-identified, earlier application, the 
contents of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. In general, the invention relates to 
providing a double-hulled vessel which, compared 
with conventional constructions, is made with a 
reduced number of different pieces, a reduced 
complexity, which can be fabricated using a higher 
degree of automation, which, in many applications is 
more durable and/or needs less maintenance, and need 
not cost the 20 percent additional that a conventional 
double hull costs compared with a conventional single 
hull. In fact, in some instances, a double hull 
produced in accordance with the invention can 
successfully compete in price with a conventional 
single hull for the same duty and carrying capacity. As a result of a 1970's convention entered  
 
into by the major maritime shipping nations (the 
"MARPOL Convention"), bulk petroleum carrier ships 
must have separate tanks for ballast and cargo oil. 
Ships thereupon necessarily become larger in overall 
size for carrying the same amount of cargo. Fewer 
bulk petroleum carrier ships were built to this 
requirement than had been built to serve the same 
market within a comparable prior period. Also, new 
and aggressively expanding factors in the bulk cargo 
vessel field sought to capture market share by cutting 
out what they deemed excess weight in the construction 
of hulls for such vessels. Part of the reduction was 
accomplished by using high tensile strength steel, but 
some was accomplished by reducing the safety margin in 
the thickness, spacing and redundancy of 
constructional elements conventionally provided to 
accommodate loss of strength due to corrosion 
occurring during the expected life of the vessel. At 
the same time, carrying only ballast in certain tanks 
of the vessel, due to requirements of the MARPOL 
Convention, caused accelerated corrosion. The need 
for better coatings was not recognized soon enough; 
therefore,
