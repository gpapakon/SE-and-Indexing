<ABSTRACT>
In the case of internal combustion engines which draw in air via the crankcase, the con-rod bearings (5, 3) and the surface (29) over which the piston slides are generally lubricated by adding the required quantity of oil to the intake air, but this has a very disadvantageous effect on the exhaust emissions and the oil consumption of such engines. In order to improve the exhaust emissions and reduce the oil consumption while maintaining high operational reliability, the proposal is that recirculated-oil lubrication is provided at least to lubricate the crankshaft bearings (7), and that at least one crankshaft bearing (7) is connected to the big-end bearing (5) by an oil passage (8) within the crankshaft (6) and the said bearing in turn is connected to the gudgeon-pin bearing (3) by an oil passage (10) within the connecting rod (4), and that means for oil-sealing the crankshaft bearings (7), the big-end bearings (5) and the gudgeon-pin bearings (3) relative to the crank space are provided.
