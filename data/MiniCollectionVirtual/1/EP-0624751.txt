<ABSTRACT>
A thermally-actuated steam trap, which performs the opening 
and closing operations of a valve according to a change in 

the volume of an expansible medium (15), comprises at least 
two diaphragms (14,18) and a valve member (16) fitted to 

the lower diaphragm (18). The lower diaphragm (18) is 
shaped so that it comes to be more sensitive to a change in 

pressure than the upper diaphragm (14), to provide a steam 
trap which permits a discharge passage to be opened also 

when the fluid pressure at the inlet side is relatively 
week, and which is stable in operation from the initial 

stage as the opening and closing operations of the valve 
are performed intermittently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steam trap for 
automatically discharging condensate generated in various 
kinds of steam using equipment and steam pipe lines, and, 
more particularly, to a thermally-actuated steam trap 
adapted to discharge the condensate below a desired 
temperature out of a system by using a temperature control 
element including a medium which is heated and expanded by 
steam and cooled and contracted by condensate. Such a thermally-actuated steam trap is provided with a 
body having therein a valve chest in which steam or 
condensate is introduced and a temperature control element 
disposed in the valve chest. The temperature control 
element used for such a steam trap comprises two disk-like 
wall members, an upper one and a lower one, and at least 
one diaphragm provided between the two wall members, the 
diaphragm being secured at its outer peripheral edge to 
both the wall members, and the inner space formed between 
the upper wall member and diaphragm accomodating an 
expansible medium which changes in volume corresponding to  
 
the temperature. Further, on the diaphragm at the side opposite 
the expansible medium side is carried a valve member. In such a steam trap, since the diaphragm member and the 
valve member are displaced to perform the opening and closing 
operations of the valve part, the diaphragm member composed 
of a particularly thin member is often damaged and the steam 
trap comes not to fulfill its function; so, it has hitherto 
been widely performed to constitute the diaphragm member 
with a plurality of diaphragm sheets for its reinforcement, 
as shown in DE 26 30 038 B1. U.S. Pat. No. 4,955,536 also 
shows a plurality of diaphragms in its drawings without depending 
upon their relation to the technical contents proposed 
therein. Further, there are also known steam traps provided 
with a plurality of diaphragms in such a state as shown in 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,220 and EP-A-0012267. US-A-4,013,220 
discloses a thermally-actuated steam trap having a temperature 
control element comprising two membranes as diaphragms. The 
pliability of each of the membranes is not constant over its 
diameter, in order to ensure a reliable check valve function. 
However, with this kind of radial variation in the pliability 
of the membranes it is not possible for the discharge passage 
to be opened when the fluid pressure at the inlet side is 
relatively weak or for the operation to be stable from the 
initial stage. Moreover, the inventor of the present application filed a

<CLAIMS>
A thermally-actuated steam trap comprising: 

a valve casing having an inlet (4), a valve chest (3) 
and an outlet (5); 
a valve seat member (7) disposed between said valve 
chest (3) and said outlet (5) and having a discharge 

passage (8); 
a temperature control element (9) disposed within said 
valve c
hest (3), 
said temperature control element (9) including 
two disk-like wall members, an upper one (11) and a 
lower one (19), 
at least two diaphragms, an upper one (14) and a lower 
one (18), secured at their circumferential edges between 

said wall members (11,19), and 
an expansible medium (15) sealed between said upper wall 
member (11) and said upper diaphragm (14), 
a valve member (16) being fitted to said lower diaphragm 
characterized in that
 
at least said lower diaphragm (18) is shaped with 

ripples so that the contact between said two diaphragms 
(14,18) comes to be lines of contact or points of 

contact due to the difference in shape of said upper and 
lower diaphragms or said lower diaphragm (18) is 

formed to be thinner than said upper diaphragm (14) 
or said lower diaphragm (18) is formed by a material 

more elastic than said upper diaphragm (14), so that 
said lower diaphragm (18) becomes more sensitive to a 

change in pressure than said upper diaphragm (14).  
 
A thermally-actuated steam trap as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said upper diaphragm (14) is further curved 

convexly toward said expansible medium side to provide it 
with the function of a leaf spring which resists a change 

in the volume of said expansible medium (15).
