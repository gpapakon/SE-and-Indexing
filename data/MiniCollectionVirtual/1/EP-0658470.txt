<ABSTRACT>
The support structure (10) comprises a relatively flat front panel (11) based on a synthetic resin with two approximately vertical opposite lateral sides (101) and two approximately horizontal opposite edges, a top one (1021) and a bottom one (1022), and with a front face (1031) and a rear face (1032) and a metal framework (12) with a beam particularly of U-shaped configuration which has two lateral branches (121) close to the opposite sides (101) and a transverse bar (122) joining these branches (121) together and close to this bottom edge (1022), and with bases (123) able to be fastened to the longerons of a structural shell. Application for land-based motor vehicles.

A support structure for the front of a motor vehicle intended for 
mounting on the vehicle shell structure provided with end side 

members, and adapted to receive in particular bodywork 
members such as the wings, bumper, radiator grille and bonnet 

lock and providable in particular with equipment such as the 
headlamp assemblies, an air blower, an air filter and a horn, the 

said support structure (10) comprising a relatively flat, synthetic-resin-based 
front panel (11) having two substantially vertical 

opposing lateral sides (101) and two substantially horizontal upper 
(1021) and lower (1022) opposing edges (102) and having front 

and rear surfaces (103), characterised in that it also comprises a 
metal frame (12) comprising a U-shaped girder having two lateral 

arms (121) in proximity to the opposing sides (101), and a transverse 
bar (122) connecting the arms (121) in proximity to the lower edge 

(1022), and comprising mounting plates (123) fixable to the side 
members of the shell structure. 
A support structure according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
lateral arms (121) are asymmetrical. 
A support structure according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the metal frame (12) comprises a central leg (124) substantially  

 
perpendicular to the transverse bar (122) and extending towards 

the upper edge (1021) between the lateral arms (121). 
A support structure according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
central leg (124) is longer than the lateral arms (121). 
A support structure according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the mounting plates (123) are carried by the 

lateral arms (121). 
A support structure according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the front panel (11) has a casing (111) 

arranged in proximity to each of its lateral sides (101) and the 
upper edge (1021) and intended to receive a headlamp 

assembly, and in that at least one of the lateral arms (121) is bent 
so as to surround at least part of the casing (111). 
A support structure according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the metal frame (12) comprises at least one 

plate (125) for receiving a bonnet lock. 
A support structure according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
plate (125) is carried by one of the lateral arms (121). 
A support structure according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that 
the plate (125) is carried by the central leg (124). 
A support structure according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that it has base plates for receiving a bumper.  

 
A support structure according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the base plates and mounting plates (123) are a continuation of 

one another. 
A support structure according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the central panel (11) has a centre region 

(113) for receiving an air blower and pierced by at least one 
opening (114). 
A support structure according to claim 12, characterised in that 
the opening (114) is provided with at least one arm (115) for 

receiving a motor-driven fan unit. 
A support structure according to claim 12 or 13, characterised in 
that the centre region (113) is provided with a trough for receiving 

an air filter.
