<ABSTRACT>
A high efficiency microwave amplifier includes a 
variable-impedance impedance matching circuit (43) for the 

amplifier. The variable impedance is controlled from the 
outside to provide a maximum power efficiency at a 

transmission frequency to be used in the amplifier. The 
microwave amplifier is used in a portable telephone system 

to provide a maximum power efficiency at any transmission 
frequency allocated by a base station within a predetermined 

frequency band. The deviation in power efficiency is 
controlled within 1 dB over the frequency band to be used in 

the telephone system, resulting in a continuous long-period 
operation of the portable telephone system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microwave amplifier 
having a variable-impedance impedance matching circuit and, 
more particularly, to a microwave amplifier capable of 
amplifying a microwave signal with a high efficiency by 
varying a load impedance of the microwave amplifier in 
accordance with the frequency of the input thereof. A high efficiency microwave amplifier for amplifying 
microwave signal with a high efficiency is widely used in a 
developing portable telephone system. A conventional high 
efficiency microwave amplifier used in a portable telephone 
system generally comprises an impedance matching circuit or 
load matching circuit having an optimal fixed impedance, 
regardless of the frequency of a transmission signal, to 
obtain a desired characteristic over the frequency band to 
be used in the telephone system. In a high efficiency microwave amplifier used in a 
portable telephone system, the efficiency of each component  
 
thereof is made as close as its maximum. As a result, the 
conventional microwave amplifiers have only narrow band 
characteristics, hence, they have a problem that their 
output characteristics are not flat over the frequency band 
to be used, even when the input and output impedances 
thereof are set at a fixed value. Accordingly, the 
conventional high efficiency microwave amplifier produces 
some extent of deviation in output characteristic within the 
frequency band to be used, resulting in a significant excess 
power consumption. In view of the foregoing, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a microwave amplifier having an 
improved power efficiency. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
portable telephone system comprising a high efficiency 
microwave amplifier having a variable load impedance, 
thereby realizing a reduction of the power consumption in 
the portable telephone system over a predetermined band of 
the telephone system. The present invention provides, in a first aspect 
thereof, a microwave amplifier comprising an amplifying 
means for amplifying a microwave signal, an impedance 
matching circuit having a variable impedance operatively 
connected to the output of the amplifying means, a control  
 
means for providing to the impedance matching circuit a 
control signal for varying said variable impedance in 
accordance with the frequency of the microwave signal. The present invention also provides, in a second aspect 
thereof, a potable telephone system comprising: a signal 
generating section for generating a
