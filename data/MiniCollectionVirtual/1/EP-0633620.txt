<ABSTRACT>
In an alkaline zinc cell, provision is made, in order to prevent accumulation of hydrogen gas which is produced by corrosion of the anode zinc, to apply a viscous adhesive with which a catalytically active metal (for example Raney Ni) is admixed, only point-wise to one of the cathode rings. The catalyst, which is at a high positive potential because of its electrically conducting contact with the cathode, absorbs hydrogen and recombines it with high conversion rate to form water. Application of the catalyst-containing adhesive, preferably an active glue, onto the cathode body or onto a cell component (separator, housing can) which is in surface contact with this body can be carried out by means of brushes, drop-application from a syringe or by pad-application.

<CLAIMS>
Process for making a galvanic cell having an MnO
2
 cathode,
a zinc anode which is isolated therefrom by a separator, and

an electrolyte which comprises an aqueous alkali metal
solution, with the galvanic cell containing means for

preventing the accumulation of hydrogen gas, characterised in
that by dropping or stamping at a plurality of points there is

applied to the surface of the cathode body or a cell component
surface which is in contact with the cathode a mixture of a

catalyst material which is enabled to recombine hydrogen and
an active adhesive.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that Raney
nickel is used as the catalyst material.
Process according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterised in
that the mixture is applied before cell assembly to that face

of the separator which bears on the surface of the cathode.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that from 0.06 g to 0.25 g, preferably from

0.09 g to 0.23 g, of Raney nickel are utilised per 1.3 g of
anode zinc in the cell.
