<ABSTRACT>
An extrusion blow molding process for a heat-treated, 
liquid crystalline polymer is provided. By the 

process, molten polymer having improved melt strength, is 
vertically extruded downward into space through a parison-forming, 

annular gap. Sag resistant parisons are formed. 
Beneficially, the parisons may be formed periodically. 

Advantageously, large-sized parts or structures may be 
produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an extrusion blow 
moldable, liquid crystalline polymer. Extrusion blow molding is useful for making 
hollow parts or structures having a variety of uses. 
Containers such as tanks, pressure vessels, cylinders and 
bottles, which may be used for pressurized or compressed 
gases and cryogenic gases, may be conveniently formed by 
extrusion blow molding. Liquid crystal or crystalline polymers (LCPs) 
are beneficially characterized by gas barrier properties, 
chemical resistance or inertness, high creep resistance, 
excellent retention of properties over a broad temperature 
range including lack of embrittlement at cryogenic 
temperatures, and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. 
However, liquid crystalline polymers are difficult to 
process by extrusion blow molding. According to Plastics World, p. 11, July 1988 
and Adv. Mater., 10 (10), p. 2, June 27, 1988, a moldable 
LCP is known. The LCP may be crystalline and moldable in 
30% and 50% glass-reinforced formulations, or may be 
amorphous and extrudable, blow moldable and injection 
moldable in neat, glass-reinforced and glass/mineral 
formulations. In continuous extrusion blow molding, parisons 
are continually formed and molds move into place to accept 
tubes of molten polymer. Continuous extrusion blow molding 
to impart biaxial orientation to a part made from a 
copolyester LCP (hydroxybenzoic acid and 6-hydroxy-2-naphthoic 
acid), has been attempted. In this regard, 
Blizard and Baird, Intern. Polymer Processing, 4: 172-178  
 
(1989), report forming a small part having no observed 
biaxial orientation, and rapid solidification to be a 
processing limitation. However, they report success and 
the benefit of relatively slow crystallization for a 
copolyester made from hydroxybenzoic acid and polyethylene 
terephthalate. Processing difficulties are accentuated when a 
large-sized part is desired, and also when uniformity of 
wall thickness is important. Therefore, there is a need 
for an improved process for forming a liquid crystalline 
polymer into a hollow part or structure by extrusion blow 
molding. In accordance with the present invention, a 
broadly applicable method for forming a hollow part or 
structure from an extrusion blow moldable, liquid crystal 
or crystalline polymer, is provided. In accordance with 
the invention, a melt strength-enhanced, liquid crystalline 
polymer is heated to a molten state, and in particular to a 
temperature suitable for extruding the polymer in the form 
of a sag resistant,
