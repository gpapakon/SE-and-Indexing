<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer analytical element has been 
prepared for accurate and rapid colorimetric 

determination of ethanol in aqueous specimens using 
alcohol dehydogenase and an oxidized nicotinamide 

coenzyme. The element includes two reagent layers 
beneath a porous spreading layer. The element also 

contains niacinamide in one or more layers to reduce 
the interference from alcohols other than ethanol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clinical chemistry.
In particular, it relates to a multilayer analytical
element and method for the quantitative determination
of ethanol.Ethanol testing can be accomplished using
both enzymatic and nonenzymatic assays. The
nonenzymatic assays have a number of disadvantages and
are being widely replaced by enzymatic assays which are
more accurate, highly specific, more sensitive and
require less expensive procedures. Enzymatic assays
are generally based on the use of alcohol dehydrogenase
to catalyze the reaction of ethanol to acetaldehyde.
This reaction can be used alone, or in combination with
other reactions to produce a spectrophotometric signal
which can be related to the amount of ethanol in the
tested specimen.One enzymatic assay is based on the direct
measurement of the reduced coenzyme (NADH), such as
that described in US-A-3,926,736. This assay is
carried out entirely in solution.Another enzymatic assay is described in EP-A-0
464 942, which uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) as a coenzyme with alcohol dehydrogenase to
produce the reduced form of the coenzyme. The
coenzyme, in turn, reacts with a tetrazolium salt to
produce a detectable dye. The described assay is
carried out in a multilayer analytical element
containing tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer and
both crosslinked and uncrosslinked gelatin layers.One problem that has been encountered in
developing a dry analytical element for the assay of
ethanol is the strong interference by fluoride ion
present in human serum. Fluoride ion is commonly used
as a preservative in serum, and interferes in assays 
possibly by altering the equilibrium between ethanol
and acetaldehyde, and causes the assay results to be
biased positively compared to the true value of ethanol
in the specimen. This problem has been effectively
solved using a multilayer analytical element containing
a high amount of buffer which is arranged in certain
layers. Moreover, this element typically contains
crosslinked gelatin as a binder for one or more of the
reagent layers.While the element just described can be used
effectively to detect ethanol, it is understood that
alcohol dehydrogenase is not 100% specific for ethanol.
Thus, it also acts on some other alcohols, such as
isopropanol and ethylene glycol, as substrates as well.
Because of this reduced specificity for ethanol, other
alcohols can act as interferents in an assay for
ethanol. It would be highly desirable to reduce or
eliminate those interferences.A highly effective
