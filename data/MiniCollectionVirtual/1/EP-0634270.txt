<ABSTRACT>
A multilayered film composed of the outer layer 
comprising a linear ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having a 

density of 0.920-0.950 g/cm³, the intermediate layer comprising 
a linear ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having a density 

of 0.920/cm³ or less, and the inner layer comprising a 
resin composed of a linear ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having 

a density of 0.940 g/cm³ or less and containing 20-40 
wt.% of polypropylene, wherein a high-density polyethylene 

having a density of 0.960 g/cm³ or above is incorporated in 
all of the outer, intermediate and inner layers in amounts 

of, respectively, 15-55 wt.%, 15-55 wt.% and 5-50 wt.%; 
and a container made by molding the above film, which is 

free from the fear of sealing strength lowering, deformation, 
transparency lowering, and the like even when sterilized at 

a temperature as high as 120 °C or above and can provide 
a double-compartment container having a stabilized, easy-to-peel 

sealing part, thus being suitable for use as a transfusion bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-layer film
and a container molded using the same. More particularly, it
relates to a multi-layer film used for a container having a
plurality of chambers which is suitably used for containing a
liquid medicine, etc., in the medical field, said container
capable of separately containing two or more kinds of
medicines and mixing them on use, and a container using the
same.Heretofore, in medical plastic containers, various
containers having a plurality of chambers have been studied so
as to enable them to contain separately two or more kinds of
medicines, e.g. amino acid solution and sugar electrolyte
solution, antibiotic and liquid for dissolving the same, etc.,
to mix them aseptically on use. Example thereof include a
container wherein an easy peelable seal part is formed between
two chambers using a resin mixture of polyethylene and
polypropylene (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2-4671).However, since heat resistance is not sufficiently
taken into consideration in the above container, a sealing
strength and drop-shock resistance are deteriorated by 
sterilization under high-temperature condition such as high-pressure
steam sterilization, hot-water sterilization, etc
and, further, deformation is arisen and transparency and
flexibility are deteriorated. Particularly, when the
temperature condition of the sterilization is set at a severe
condition, i.e. not less than 120 °C, not only a strength is
drastically reduced but also serious failure such as
deterioration of the easy peelable seal part is arisen.On the other hand, there have been proposed a
medical bag having a three-layer structure wherein a resin
composition composed of a radical-polymerized low-density
polyethylene having a density of not more than 0.930 g/cm3 and
a high-density polyethylene having a density of not less than
0.945 g/cm3 is used for inner and outer layers, and a resin
composition composed of a linear low-density polyethylene
having a density of not more than 0.920 g/cm3 and a high-density
polyethylene having a density of not less than 0.945
g/cm3 are used as an intermediate layer (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 4-266759) in order to improve heat
resistance.However, the above container has not satisfactory
heat resistance yet and it is not taken into consideration at
all to provide an easy peelable seal part and, therefore, it
can not be used for a container having a plurality of
chambers, as a matter of course. It is a main object of the present invention to
provide a
