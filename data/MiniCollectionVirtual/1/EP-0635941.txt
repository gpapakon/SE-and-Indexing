<ABSTRACT>
The system (1) comprises an internal clock (7), supplying a signal of imprecise period T1, and clock resynchronisation means configured to determine (8) the number N of periods T1 of the signal of the internal clock (7) during which the signal of the internal clock (7) has experienced a drift of a period To with respect to the reference signal with period To of an external clock (3), and in order to supply (12) a signal, of period NT1, of pulses intended to delay the signal of the internal clock (7) by a duration PTo, P being a whole number equal to or greater than 1. The invention is well suited to a portable radiotelephony terminal.

Electronic system (1) comprising an internal clock (7), 
supplying a signal of an imprecise period T1 to a time base 

(6), and means (8-14) for resetting the clock, arranged in 
order, in combination with an external reference clock (3) 

supplying a signal of a period To, to compensate for the 
impreciseness of the period T1 of the signal of the 

internal clock (7), characterised in that the clock 
resetting means are arranged to determine the number N of 

periods T1 of the signal of the internal clock (7) during 
which the signal of the internal clock (7) has undergone a 

drift of a period To with respect to the reference signal 
and in order to supply to the time base (6) a signal, of a 

period NT1, of pulses intended to retard, for a duration 
PTo, the clock signal supplied by the time base (6), P 

being an integer equal to or greater than 1. 
System according to claim 1, wherein the clock 
resetting means comprise means (8) for determining the 

number N of periods T1 at the end of which the signal of 
the internal clock (7) has drifted by a period To with 

respect to the reference signal and means (9-11) for 
determining the direction of the drift. 
System according to claim 2, wherein the means for 
determining the direction of the drift of the resetting 

means comprise an auxiliary clock (10) of a period 3T1 
three times that of the internal clock (7), means (9) for 

creating a triple time window of a width 3To with a central 
window and two lateral windows each of a width To, and a 

rising leading edge of the signal of the auxiliary clock 
(10) in the central window at the beginning of the 

determination period, and means (9) for detecting the 
rising leading edge in question of the signal of the  

 
auxiliary clock (10) in one or other of the two lateral 

windows of the triple window. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
resetting means are arranged in order, from the retardation 

signal, to compensate for the drift and to reset, all the N 
periods T1, the signal of the internal clock (7) with the 

drift of amplitude To. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
resetting means are arranged in order, from the 

retardation signal, to compensate, for all the PN periods 
T1, the signal of the internal clock (7) a drift of 

amplitude PTo, P being a constant integer. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
resetting means are arranged in order, from the 

retardation signal, to compensate for the drift in an 
asynchronous manner and to reset, all the PN periods T1, the 

signal of the internal clock (7) with a drift of amplitude 
PTo, P being a variable integer.
