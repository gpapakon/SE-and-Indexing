Particularly preferred compounds are N-phenyl-N-methyl-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-car boxamide or a salt thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Th e u se o f qu i n o l i ne - 3 -c a rb o x ami de c omp o u n d s f o r t r e a tm ent o f d i ab e t es .General backgroundDiabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by physiologic and anatomic abnormalities in many organs, due to vascular abnormalities. However, the most prominent feature of the disease is disturbed glucose metabolism, resulting in hyperglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is usually divided into two major categories: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type I diabetes), which usually develops in childhood or adolescence and these patients are prone to ketosis and acidosis. The second category of patients (Type II diabetes) are not insulin dependent and usually manage with diet and oral hypoglycemic therapy. The annual incidence of Type I diabetes ranges from 10 cases/100.000 persons for non- white males to 16 cases/100.000 persons for white males in the United States, with equal incidence between males and females. The prevalence of Type I diabetes for all ages in the United States population is 160 cases/100.000 persons, with a slightly earlier onset for females with peak age of onset at 10-12 years than for males with peak age of onset at 18 years. Genetic background plays a major role in the development of the disease, with 40 % concordance for Type I diabetes exhibited by identical twins and increased incidence among family members. Genes associated with increased susceptability to Type I diabetes reside near the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6, with more than 90 % of persons with Type I diabetes featuring DR3 or DR4 haplotypes or both. Likewise, siblings sharing DR3 or.DR4 haplotypes from both parents more often than random develop Type I diabetes (1).The onset of symptoms in Type I diabetes is usually acute and frequently follows an antecedant viral infection which might be the trigger to a process leading to destruction of the beta cells secondary to autoimmune insulitis. When beta cell destruction reaches the critical point, the patient's reduced insulin levels lead to hyperglycemia with the typical symptomatology of Type I diabetes. At diagnosis approximately 70 % of patients with Type I diabetes have antibodies to islet cell cytoplasm i.e. antigens or to components of the islet cell 

surface. Approximately 15 % of patients with Type I diabetes may also show other autoimmune features, such as hypothyroidism, Graves' disease, Addison's disease, myasthenia gravis and pernicious anemia (2). Autopsies of cases with Type I diabetes show a typical lymphocytic
