<ABSTRACT>
In an exchange system which performs a 
communication based on personal identification 

information for identifying respective subscribers, the 
invention has an object of providing a system which can 

flexibly accommodate a change of the communication 
terminal of actual use by a movement, for instance, of a 

calling-side subscriber or a call-receiving-side 
subscriber. A camp-on communication managing apparatus 

of the invention has a personal position registration 
table in which terminal identification information for 

identifying a communication terminal registered to a 
subscriber for each personal identification information 

for identifying the subscriber is registered, and 
manages communication terminals used by respective 

subscribers. Thus, a camp-on communication can be 
established even where a camp-on-registered subscriber 

changes his communication terminal of actual use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for managing a camp-on operation between
subscribers in an exchange system in which a
communication is performed based on personal
identification information for identifying individual
subscribers.Recent exchange systems have various functions for
improving the efficiency of information exchange
processing - see also GB-A-2 263 845. Camp-on is an example of such functions.The camp-on is a function in which when a
communication terminal A calls a communication terminal
B but the latter is busy, the call from the
communication terminal A is temporarily disconnected and
the communication terminals A and B are called after the
communication terminal B becomes free.More specifically, when the communication terminal
A calls the communication terminal B but the latter is
busy, an exchange system registers terminal numbers of
the communication terminals A and B. Then, the exchange
system temporarily disconnects the call from the
communication terminal A, and monitors the communication 
status of the communication terminal B. Upon detection
of the communication terminal B becoming free, the
communication system calls the communication terminals A
and B based on their terminal numbers.The function of camp-on makes it unnecessary for
the communication terminal A to perform a cumbersome
work of calling plural times the communication terminal
B until the end of its communication, and allows a
communication to be established between the
communication terminals A and B immediately after the
communication terminal B becomes free.In the above function of camp-on, which is based on
the terminal numbers of the respective communication
terminals, at a time point when, for instance, a
subscriber on a call-receiving side changes his
communication terminal of actual use by transfer, call
park, etc. with his communication maintained while camp-on
registration is effective, it is detected that a
camp-on-registered communication terminal has become
free and, therefore, that terminal not being accompanied
by the subscriber is called as a camp-on operation.
Also, when a subscriber on a calling side leaves his
communication terminal of actual use while camp-on
registration is effective, he needs to cancel the camp-on
setting, which is a cumbersome work. If he fails to
cancel the setting, that communication terminal is
called as a camp-on operation as soon as a communication 
terminal on a call-receiving side becomes free, which is
inefficient.An object of the present invention
