<CLAIMS>
A thermo-weld union to join at least two elements made of 
identical or compatible plastic material including a body 

(1, 11) composed at least in part of a thermo-fusible 
material compatible with the said materials of the said 

elements and which has an inner wall (2, 12) or bonding 
surface directly opposite the outer wall of at least one of 

the said elements and which contains an electrical 
conductor element in the form of a net of knitted wires (3, 

13) characterized by the fact that the net is obtained by 
knitting together an electrically conducting wire and an 

electrically non-conducting wire. 
Union under claim 1, characterized by the fact that the 
conductor wire is coated with a varnish which is an insulator 

and is resistant to welding temperatures. 
Union under claim 1, characterized by the fact that the 
non-conducting wire is made of a plastic material 
Union under claim 2, characterized by the fact that the 
electrically conducting element is composed of two layers 

(13a and 13b) which are obtained from a single knitting 
operation in the form of two widely open cones (13a and 

13b) with facing summits that are then pressed against 
each other to obtain a disk. 
Union under claim 4, characterized by the fact that an insulating 
element is inserted between the two cones. 
Union under claim 5, characterized by the fact that the insulating 
element has an opening (17) of about the same 

diameter at the small opening in the cones. 
The process for producing a union under claims 1 through 
6, characterized by the fact that the said electrically 

conducting element (3, 13) is applied against the inner 
wall (2, 12) of the union, that it is held there by pressure 

and that the said elements are heated to let it penetrate 
into the said wall.
