<ABSTRACT>
In order, for the leak testing of containers (3) whose cross-sectional area tapers in one direction, by means of application of a pressure difference between a test chamber and the interior of the containers (3), to define an intermediate volume (Vz) which is as small as possible, the test chamber has a casing (39) which also tapers, in a manner similar to the container (3) to be tested, a closure lid in the opening region (41) as well as, on a bottom part, an ejection piston (47). Furthermore, an outlet line (49) for cleaning agent is closed in a leaktight manner or opened, respectively, by means of the piston (47).

A test chamber for the non-destructive leak 
testing of a vessel with an external cross-sectional 

surface which decreases in one axial direction of the 
vessel, the test chamber having a closable cavity for 

receiving the vessel, which cavity is connected to an 
evacuation means for producing a pressure difference, 

as initial condition, between the interior of the 
vessel and the outer space of the vessel formed between 

the walls of the cavity and the vessel, and also to a 
pressure measurement means for measuring a pressure 

variable which is dependent on the pressure difference 
and the tightness of the vessel, characterised in that 

a discharge line for a rinsing agent which can be 
sealed closed opens into the cavity. 
A test chamber according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the line can be opened and sealed closed by 

means of a piston, which preferably also acts as a 
vessel-ejecting piston. 
A test chamber according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the base of the cavity comprises a plate of the 

piston and the line is opened or sealed closed by the 
side of the piston plate remote from the cavity. 
A test chamber according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the chamber comprises a bush 

closed on one side, the open cross-sectional surface 
area of which decreases towards the base of the bush, 

and that a closing cover for sealing the bush closed is 
provided. 
A test chamber according to one of Claims 1 to 4 
for vessels substantially in t
he shape of a truncated  
 

cone, characterised in that the bush is substantially 
in the shape of a truncated cone. 
A test chamber according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it is spatially arranged such 

that the opening thereof lies at the top. 
An arrangement with a plurality of test chambers 
according to one of Claims 1 to 6 for the in-line 

testing of the vessels in production once they have 
been sealed. 
An arrangement according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the test chambers are arranged on a carousel. 
The use of the test chambers according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6 or of the arrangement according to one of 

Claims 7 or 8 for the testing of filled, closed 
plastics beakers, such as yoghurt beakers.
