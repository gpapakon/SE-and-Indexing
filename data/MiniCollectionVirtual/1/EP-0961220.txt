<ABSTRACT>
A high speed image data interface between a print server containing a page
description language decomposer and an interface card, and a printer containing a

rendering card and a print engine, where the interface card is physically located in the
printer case and is plugged into the backplane of the printer. The interface is synchronous

and carries clock, page request, line request and reset signals from the renderer, and line
valid, error and data signals from the interface card. Other communications between the

printer and server are carried by a telephone line or local area network. The advantage of
this arrangement is that the printer manufacturer can design the printer without having to

design the interface card to match the server manufacturer's requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
An image data interface between a printer and its server, or digital front
end (DFE), which specifies the data to be transferred between an interface card in the
printer which is electrically connected to the digital front end and the rendering,
halftoning, card in the printer which halftones the image, the interface data including
contone image data, printing hints and page and line start signals.How to optimally connect various computer peripherals to a computer has
been a continuing problem. A computer usually has a backplane which provides a
standard interface between cards, and a peripheral such as a disk drive may be sold with an
interface card that communicates between the drive and the backplane. In this case, the
backplane is the interface.A different configuration is used in a modem networked printer. The
generation of a page containing text and image data frequently starts at a terminal where
the user generates a computer generated graphic or receives a contone image from a
scanner, generates text, combines image and text in a highly compressed form using a
page description language (PDL), and sends the result to a printer server, a DFE, which is
usually located somewhere near the printer. Here, a decomposer expands the PDL into
separations of bit maps and sends the resultant video over wire or fiber cables or a
network to the printer. Finally, the printer has an interface card which reformats the data
into rasters, halftones them in a rendering card, and applies them to the raster output
scanner (ROS), In this case, the interface is the connection between the server and the
printer. The problem with this system is that different server manufacturers build
their servers to output over different systems, like wire or fiber, cable or networks, using
different data protocols, and this puts a large burden on the printer manufacturer to design
the printer to accept the interface restrictions of the server or servers being used.This invention provides for the interface to be between an interface card
and the rendering card. Both are within the printer, but the interface is now separate from
the backplane. Also, the server manufacturer, who designed the transmitter for the means
of communication between the server and printer, also designs the receiver. This is a
much more efficient method of designing a networked printing system since the server
manufacturer who already has the expertise in designing, for example, a fiber optic
network transmitter can conveniently design the receiver as well,
