<ABSTRACT>
A Contact Smart Card (3) is inserted in a contact card reader and its capacitance is 
measured by applying a square wave generated by an oscillator (1) to it via a resistor 

(4). The capacitance effect of the smart card (3) affects the amplitude of the output 
from the resistor (1) and the output is monitored in an amplitude detector (2) 

connected to receive the signal output from the resistor (4) and to compare it against 
a threshold level for the signal previously established and stored for an acceptable 

card.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for verifying the integrity of 
a Smart Card. "Smart Cards" are cards normally of a plastics material having embedded in 
them circuitry and active or passive components which carry information in coded 
form. These cards are used as enabling devices and can have the information in 
them altered or changed at will and information can be read out from the card to 
check an identity or authority when the card is used as a key or pass card. Although some Smart Cards may include their own power source such as a 
built in battery or may be activated externally by an induction or capacitative 
connection many rely on actual physical connections to host device. The present 
invention is particularly concerned with such cards which are hereinafter referred to 
as 'Contact Smart Cards'. Since the cards may be used as a money substitute or for 
enabling a privileged access it is important that only truly authenticated cards are able 
to be used and that false cards or simulations of card effects are detected and are 
unable to be used. The cards may, for example, be used in such areas as to permit 
travel on a transit system or to operate decoders for pay television or in public 
telecommunication networks or for the access to personal and confidential information.  With the increasing reliance on Smart Cards in such areas, it is important that 
the host system cannot be deceived by anything which is not a genuine Smart Card, 
issued by the controlling authority. The possibility of simulating the behaviour of certain types of Smart Cards has 
been demonstrated, using only a basic circuit consisting of easily available electronic 
components. This opens the way for a person with a basic knowledge of electronics 
to by-pass payment or compromise security. Knowing that it is possible for an unscrupulous person to build such a circuit, 
which can be functionally indistinguishable from a genuine card, some means is 
required to detect whether the Smart Card presented is in fact genuine, or is a 
simulated card. An effective way of distinguishing between genuine Smart Cards and Smart 
Card simulating circuits would be to detect the presence of the wires which would be 
required to connect such a circuit to the Smart Card reader contacts. Traditional methods of detecting the connecting wires have involved coils 
mounted around the card reader entry slot. This involves the difficulty and expense 
of mechanically mounting these coils. These methods can also be overcome by

<CLAIMS>
A method for verifying a Contact Smart Card of the kind hereinbefore defined, 
characterised in that the method includes the step of detecting the capacitance of any 

wires connecting the Contact Smart Card to the host apparatus, applying a signal to 
the Contact Smart Card and comparing the effect of the signal on a detector with the 

results previously obtained from a genuine and authorised card to establish whether 
a proper card or a false or simulated card is being used. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the signal is produced 
by a square wave oscillator (1) in square wave form and fed through a resistor (4) to 

a Smart Card (3) to give with the capacitance effect of the wire an RC time constant. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in that the method 
includes the step of monitoring the rise and fall times of the signal. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that the rise and fall times of 
the signal is monitored by an amplitude detector (2) connected between the resistor 

(4) and the card (3) to be verified. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim characterised by calibrating the 
host apparatus by presenting it with a known genuine card measuring, the capacitance 

thereof and storing the measured capacitance to provide a standard against which the 
capacitance of any later inserted card is assessed. 
A method as claimed in Claim 5, characterised by setting in the memory 
threshold levels for the difference in reading between the contact Smart Card being 

present or absent. 
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that the card is accepted as 
genuine if the capacitance of a card is measured as being below the net threshold 

level. 
Apparatus for verifying the integrity of a contact smart card according to the 
method as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised by comparing in association 

with a contact Smart Card reader an oscillator (1) arranged to produce in use a square 
wave and a resistor (4) converter to the output of the oscillator (1) the resistor (4) 

having its output connected to an amplitude detector (2) and to a reader containing 
the Smart Card (3) to be verified.
