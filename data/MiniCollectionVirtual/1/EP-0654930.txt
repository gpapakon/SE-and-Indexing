<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a telephone caller with ready access, 
regardless of 

his or her location, to an array of calling features and services 
through an automated 

interface. The invention provides a caller with these features and 
services by accessing 

a central database (112) via a regional processing node (110). In this 
manner, a caller may access the 

same personalized telephone services from anywhere in the world without having to be 
aware of, or conform to, particular protocols or access procedures 

required within any 
given local telephone network. The invention also serves to prompt the caller in the 

caller's language-of-choice, and accepts commands via standard dual-tone 
multi-frequency 

("DTMF") signals and/or verbally in the caller's language-of-choice.

<DESCRIPTION>
Within modern telephone networks, various automated caller-accessible 
services have long been available. These have included services facilitating the automated 
placing of credit and collect calls, services allowing a caller to place a three-party 
conference call, as well as caller-specific speed dialing services. Such automated services 
are heavily relied upon by business travelers who often find it essential to quickly place 
calls from locations outside of their home or office. As almost all businesses have become 
increasingly globalized, easy access to such automated services from within more than one 
country or region has become a necessity for more and more business travelers. While automated caller-accessible services have been offered by various 
telephone service providers worldwide, many of these services fail to address non-native 
users in a language which they can readily understand, fail to accept instructions from such 
users in a language which they speak, fail to provide a consistent means by which the 
services can be accessed from one country to another, and/or fail to provide access to the 
same array of services from one country to another. This has left the international 
business traveler without a simple, consistent and reliable means of accessing needed 
telecommunication services regardless of the particular country which that traveler happens 
to be telephoning to or from. A method embodying the principles of the invention provides a telephone 
caller ready access, regardless of his or her location, to an array of calling features and 
services through an automated interface. The invention provides a caller with these 
features and services by accessing a central database via a regional processing node. In 
this manner, a caller may access the same personalized telephone services from anywhere 
in the world without having to be aware of, or conform to, particular protocols or access 
procedures required within any given local telephone network. The invention also serves 
to prompt the caller in the caller's language-of-choice, and accepts commands via standard 
dual-tone multi-frequency ("DTMF") signals and/or verbally in the caller's language-of-choice. In the drawing:

<CLAIMS>
A method for providing a consistent means of accessing an array of 
telephone services, within a communication system comprising: 

   a plurality of independent switched telephone networks; and 
   a central processing node, including a database, said central 

processing node being linked to each of said plurality of switched telephone networks, and 
adapted to respond to signals received from a caller via any one of said plurality of 

switched telephone networks; 
   said method comprising the steps of: 

   receiving, at said central processing node, a signal originating from 
said caller requesting the provision of one or more specific telephone services; 

   retrieving from said database a listing indicative of telephone services 
available to the caller, and transmitting a representation of said listing to the caller; and 

   receiving, at said central processing node, a signal from the caller 
specifying a particular listed telephone service, and in response, effecting the specified 

service within one or more of said plurality of switched telephone networks. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said signal requesting the provision 
of one or more telephone services is representative of a verbal request made by the caller. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said representation of said listing 
transmitted to the caller is a verbal listing in the caller's language-of-choice. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said signal originating from said 
caller requesting the provision of one or more telephone services is accepted at said central 

processing node via a language specific telephone number associated with said central 
processing node. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said plurality of switched telephone 
networks includes at least one public telephone network. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said plurality of switched telephone 
networks includes at least one private telephone network. 
A method for providing a consistent means of accessing an array of 
telephone services, within a communication system comprising: 

   a plurality of independent switched telephone networks; 
   a plurality of regional processing nodes, each of which is linked to 

 
at least one of said plurality of switched telephone networks, and adapted to respond to 

signals received from a caller via said linked switched telephone network; 
and 

   a central processing node, including a database, said central 
processing node being responsively linked to each of said plurality of regional processing 

nodes; 
   said method comprising the steps of: 

   receiving, at said regional processing node, a signal originating from 
a caller requesting the provision of one or more telephone services; 

   retrieving from said database a listing indicative of telephone services 
available to the caller; 

   transmitting from said regional processing node a representation of 
said listing to the caller; and 

   receiving, at said regional processing node, a signal from the caller 
specifying a particular listed telephone service, and in response, effecting the specified 

service within one or more of said plurality of switched telephone networks. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said signal requesting the provision 
of one or more telephone services is representative of a verbal request made by the caller. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said representation of said listing 
transmitted to the caller is a verbal listing in the caller's language-of-choice. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said signal originating from said 
caller requesting the provision of one or more telephone services is accepted at said 

regional processing node via a language specific telephone number associated with said 
regional processing node. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said plurality of switched telephone 
networks includes at least one public telephone network. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said plurality of switched telephone 
networks includes at least one private telephone network.
