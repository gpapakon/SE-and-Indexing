<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing a pantothenic acid derivative and starting
materials for producing the pantothenic acid derivative,
more particularly to a method of producing a pantothenic
acid derivative which is known as having excellent
inhibition activity exerting on Acyl CoA-Cholesterol-Acyltransferase
(hereinafter referred to as "ACAT"), and
the effect of reducing the amount of lipids in the blood. Conventionally, a pantothenic acid derivative of the
following formula (I) is produced by allowing a
carboxylic acid derivative to react with an alcohol
derivative in the presence of e.g. carbodiimide derivative
which serves as a condensation agent to form
an ester bond as disclosed in
JP-A-3-218340:

wherein each of R1 and R2 is different, and is a branched
aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 5 carbon atoms,
a phenyl group or a straight chain aliphatic hydrocarbon
group having 5 to 10 carbon atoms. EP-A-421 441 describes a method of producing a pantothenic
acid derivative wherein a pantothenic acid acetonide
is reacted with an urea derivative in the presence of a carbodiimide. The above-mentioned conventional method using a
carbodiimide derivative, however, has the shortcomings
that the yield of the pantothenic acid derivative is
because of the formation of side products, and a large
amount of a urea derivative which must be eliminated by a
very complicated process is formed in the course of the 
reaction. Therefore, this is not a suitable industrial
method for producing the pantothenic acid derivative.A pantothenic acid acetonide with the following
formula (II), which serves as a starting material for
producing the above-mentioned pantothenic acid
derivative, is conventionally produced, for instance, by
a method comprising the steps of performing benzylation
of the carboxylic group of calcium pantothenate to
produce benzyl pantothenate, allowing benzyl pantothenate
to react acetone under an acidic condition to produce
pantothenic acid acetonide benzyl ester, and subjecting
the benzyl group thereof to hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis
as disclosed in JP-A-218366:
The above-mentioned method, however, has the
shortcomings that complicated steps such as protection
and deprotection of carboxylic group are included, the 
yield of the pantothenic acid acetonide is low, and a
large amount of side products have to be removed from the
reaction mixture.Therefore, this conventional method is not a
satisfactory industrial method for producing the
pantothenic acid acetonide.A urea derivative
