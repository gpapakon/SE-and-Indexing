   For the meaning of Q, R8, R9, R10, R11, X, Y, Z, m and n, refer to Claim 1. These pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrroles are distinguished by an unusual solid fluorescence in the UV and by the facility with which they can themselves be converted to pyrrolopyrrole pigments in the substrate in which they are incorporated.
