<ABSTRACT>
A powdery or particulate absorbent composition 
suitable for disposable diapers which has a specific narrow 

particle size distribution and is suitable for using with a 
fibrous material in a high concentration amount, comprising a 

mixture of:
 

   a water absorbing resin particles (A) comprising 
an acrylic acid salt and/or acrylic acid as a main monomer of the 

resulting polymer, said water absorbing resin particles having a 
structure which is crosslinked with a first crosslinking agent 

(a) having at least two double bonds capable of copolymerizing 
with the monomer and a second crosslinking agent (b) having at 

least two functional groups capable of covalently binding to a 
carboxylic group; and

 
   a specific hydrophilic silicon dioxide powder (B) 

having a water affinity of at least 70 %. 
By using the absorbent composition of the present 
invention, a disposable diaper having good dry feeling and no 

leakage even after use for a long time can be obtained. 
Particularly, it is useful for a thin-type disposable diaper 

wherein a ratio of the absorbent to the fibrous material is 
large.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powdery or
particulate absorbent composition which is suitably used for
disposable diapers. More particularly, it relates to an
absorbent composition having an excellent absorbing capacity as
well as an excellent elasticity modulus after shearing of the gel
and a moderate absorption rate, whereby excellent performance
can be maintained for a long time. The invention also relates to
the use of the absorbent composition in a disposable diaper and
to disposable diapers comprising the said absorbent composition
and a fibrous material.Heretofore, powdery or particulate water
swellable crosslinked polymers referred to as water absorbing
resins have been used as absorbents for disposable diapers.
Examples of the water absorbing resin include crosslinked
copolymers of starch-acrylic acid salts, crosslinked polyacrylic
acid salts, saponified products of crosslinked acrylic estervinyl
acetate copolymers, crosslinked copolymers of maleic
anhydride, and denaturated cellulose derivatives. Among them,
crosslinked copolymers of starch-acrylic acid salts or
crosslinked polyacrylic salts have been used for disposable
diapers, heretofore. However, the amount of the water absorbing
resin used in a conventional disposable diaper is small (e.g.
about 15 to 25 % by weight) based on the total weight of fibrous 
material such as pulp and water absorbing resin.As the disposable diaper became thin (increase in
amount of the water absorbing resin, decrease in amount of pulp)
recently, the ratio of the water absorbing resin to the fibrous
material became large, and it became impossible to obtain
satisfactory performance of the disposable diaper by employing a
conventional water absorbing resin.Namely, the absorbing capacity of the disposable
diaper can be satisfied to some extent in a conventional
disposable diaper, however, there is a problem that it is
inferior in repeated absorbing capacity of urine because of low
elasticity modulus after shearing of the absorbing gel, and
diffusion property of urine is inferior and leakage is occuring
because of unsuitable absorption rate. Furthermore, since the
conventional disposable diaper is not designed for a thin type
disposable diaper having a large ratio of the water absorbing
resin to the fibrous material, balance between absorbency under
load and elasticity modulus of the gel, shear-stability of the
absorbing gel and diffusion property of urine are not actually
taken into consideration. Particularly, performance of the
disposable diaper depends
