<ABSTRACT>
The novel Pb- and Cd-free glass frit composition, having a property profile which can be adjusted in a targeted manner, is distinguished by the fact that it contains, in addition to boron oxide, from 1 to 24 mol % of lanthanum oxide and from 0 to 10 mol % of silicic acid as network-forming oxides, and the molar ratio between boron oxide (B2O3) and lanthanum oxide (La2O3) is in the range from 3:1 to 99:1. A preferred composition essentially comprises no silicic acid. The properties of the compositions, including the softening point and the coefficient of expansion, can easily be adjusted by varying the amount of the principal constituents.
