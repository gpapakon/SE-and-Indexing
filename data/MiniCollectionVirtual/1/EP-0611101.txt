<ABSTRACT>
A valve for regulating air flow delivered to an 
internal combustion engine from a compressor has a 

body (2) defining a bore (3) through which an air flow 
is established. A vane (6) is pivotally connected to 

the body and moveable between a deployed position 
within the bore in which the vane presents a 

resistance to air flow and a retracted position in 
which the resistance is reduced. The vane is biassed 

by a spring (24) into the deployed position. A 
pressure responsive diaphragm (17) is connected to the 

vane and urges the vane into the retracted position in 
response to excess pressure within the bore. The 

valve provides improved mixture of re-circulated 
exhaust gases with air delivered to the engine's 

intake manifold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air regulating 
valve for regulating the air flow delivered to an 
internal combustion engine from a compressor in 
situations where the air flow is mixed with 
re-circulated exhaust gases before being input to the 
engine's air intake manifold. The need for such a valve arises because, when 
operating under idling or low load conditions, it is 
desirable to enhance the proportion of exhaust gas 
delivered to the intake manifold so as to minimise 
noxious exhaust emissions from the engine. It has 
hitherto been proposed that a valve be provided 
upstream of an exhaust gas re-circulation mixer to 
restrict the flow of air in response to command 
signals from an engine management system which 
actuates the valve to restrict flow under such idling 
or low load conditions. According to the present invention there is 
disclosed a valve for regulating air flow delivered to 
an internal combustion engine from a compressor, the 
valve comprising a body defining a bore through which 
an air flow is established in use, a vane pivotally 
connected to the body and movable between a deployed 
position within the bore in which the vane presents a 
resistance to the air flow and a retracted position in 
which the vane presents a reduced resistance to air 
flow, biassing means urging the vane into the deployed 
position and a pressure responsive diaphragm connected 
to the vane and operable to urge the vane into the 
retracted position in response to excess pressure 
within the bore. An advantage of such a valve is that it operates 
in a self-contained manner without the need for 
control from external sources such as an engine  
 
management system. The engine layout is thereby 
simplified by removing the need for connection between 
the valve and an external controlling device. Preferably the biassing means exerts a biassing 
force which varies as a function of vane position so 
as to increase progressively from the deployed 
position to the retracted position. A smooth transition between the deployed and 
retracted positions can thereby be effected and 
intermediate operating conditions of the engine can be 
accommodated by intermediate vane positions of the 
valve. Preferably the biassing force in the deployed 
position has a value greater than zero and the 
biassing force increases substantially linearly with 
excess pressure between the deployed position and the 
retracted position. Conveniently the body defines a chamber 
communicating with the bore, the diaphragm being 
disposed

<CLAIMS>
A valve (1) for regulating air flow 
delivered to an internal combustion engine (33) from a 

compressor (34), the valve comprising a body (2) 
defining a bore (3) through which an air flow is 

established in use, a vane (6) pivotally connected to 
the body and movable between a deployed position 

within the bore in which the vane presents a 
resistance to the air flow and a retracted position in 

which the vane presents a reduced resistance to air 
flow, biassing means (24) urging the vane into the 

deployed position and a pressure responsive diaphragm 
(17) connected to the vane and operable to urge the 

vane into the retracted position in response to excess 
pressure within the bore. 
A valve as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
biassing means exerts a biassing force which varies as 

a function of vane position so as to increase 
progressively from the deployed position to the 

retracted position. 
A valve as claimed in claim 2 wherein the 
biassing force in the deployed position has a value 

greater than zero and wherein the biassing force 
increases substantially linearly with excess pressure 

between the deployed position and the retracted 
position. 
A valve as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the body defines a chamber (16) communicating 

with the bore, the diaphragm being disposed within the 
chamber so as to partition the chamber into an inner 

portion (18) communicating with the bore and an outer 
portion (19) isolated therefrom, the housing further 

 
comprising an aperture (28) communicating between the 

outer portion and ambient air. 
A valve as claimed in claim 4 wherein the 
biassing means comprises a spring (24) located within 

the outer portion of the chamber. 
A valve as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the diaphragm is connected to the vane by 

means of a push rod (13) having a first end (12) 
connected to the diaphragm for movement therewith and 

a second end (14) connected to a crank portion (9) of 
the vane such that linear movement of the push rod is 

transmitted as rotational movement to the vane. 
A valve as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the position of the vane in the retracted 

position is such that it is substantially retracted 
from the bore as viewed axially with respect to the 

bore. 
An internal combustion engine having a 
valve as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 

bore communicates air flow between an air compressor 
(34) and the air intake of an exhaust gas 

re-circulation mixer (36). 
A method of regulating the proportion of 
air and exhaust gas input to an internal combustion 

engine as claimed in claim 8 in which the flow of air 
through the bore is attenuated by deployment of the 

vane in response to the air pressure in the bore being 
less than a predetermined lower value. 
A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein the 
vane is deployed to a varying extent so as to variably 

 
attenuate the air flow in a linear manner with respect 

to air pressure in the bore between the lower value 
and a predetermined upper value of air pressure, the 

vane being held in its retracted position when the air 
pressure is greater than the upper value.
