<ABSTRACT>
A drive assembly having a drive motor whose motor shaft (2) is mounted, with its end (15) on the output-drive side, together with a transmission (11, 20) in a transmission housing (9) which is attached to the motor plate (8) on the output-drive side, and with its end (26) on the brush side in the motor plate (7) on the brush side, each motor plate (7, 8) having a hole which merges into a centring hole which is located axially in the direction of the brush side of the motor, is smaller than the hole opening and, in the assembled state, provides the bearing for that part of the motor shaft (2) which is on the output-drive side or brush side and in each case has a centring collar, the centring hole having a slip cone in each motor plate (7, 8), and/or the centring collar having a slip cone on that part of the motor shaft (2) which is on the output-drive side or brush side. In the case of such a drive assembly, simple extension of the motor or of the transmission is possible without having to provide a large amount of free space for this purpose in the bogie (pivot mounting).

<CLAIMS>
Drive assembly having a driving motor whose 
motor shaft (2) is supported at the end (15) on the 

drive side together with gearing (11, 20) in a gearbox 
(9) secu
red to the motor end cover (8) on the drive 
side, wherein the motor end cover (8) on the drive side 

has a bore hole (14) that changes into a centre hole 
(24) which is smaller in relation to the aperture of 

the bore hole and is located axially further inwards 
and which, in the installation state, with the motor 

shaft (2) displaced axially in the direction of a motor 
end cover (7) on the brush side, ensures the seating of 

the part of the motor shaft (2) on the drive side which 
has a centring band (25), wherein the centre hole (24) 

in the motor end cover (8) on the drive side and/or the 
centring band (25) on the part of the motor shaft (2) 

on the drive side have a slip taper, and wherein the 
motor shaft (2) is supported at the end (26) on the 

brush side in the motor end cover (7) on the brush 
side, and the part of the motor shaft (2) on the brush 

side has a sliding surface (28) which, in the 
installation state, ensures the seating of the part of 

the motor shaft (2) on the brush side. 
Drive assembly according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 a bearing head (17), in which 
there is arranged the seating (16) of the end (15) of 

the motor shaft (2) on the drive side, is preformed on 
the gearbox (9). 
Drive assembly according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the bore hole (14) has a 
circumferential centring collar (23), wherein the 

aperture of the bore hole (14) is opened out in 
relation to the centre hole (24) located axially 

further inwards. 
Drive assembly according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the sliding surface on the part  
 

of the motor shaft (2) on the brush side is formed by a 
slip ring (28) surrounding the motor shaft (2). 
Drive assembly according to one of claims 1 to 
4, 
characterised in that
 the gearbox (9) is covered by 
a gearbox cover (21) in the region of the pinion (20).
