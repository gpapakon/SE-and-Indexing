A copolymer of particularly low solution viscosity,
which can be prepared by a polymerization in bulk, in

which one component (A) is initially charged at the start
of the polymerization and, in the further course of the

polymerization, at least two olefinically unsaturated
copolymerizable monomers (B) are added, component (A)

being employed in a proportion of from 5 to 50 % by
weight and component (B) being employed in a proportion

of from 95 to 50 % by weight, component (A) being one or
more glycidyl esters of aliphatic, saturated monocarboxylic

acids containing a tertiary or quaternary a
carbon atom, and the olefinically unsaturated monomers in

accordance with (B) containing

B1) one or more olefinically unsaturated monomers having
at least one -COOH group,
B2) one or more esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid
with cyclic aliphatic alcohols of 5 to 30 carbon

atoms,

and if desired one or more of components B3 to B5, namely

B3) one or more hydroxyalkyl esters of α,β-unsaturated
carboxylic acids,
B4) one or more esters of an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic
acid with a monohydric aliphatic alcohol of 1 to

20 carbon atoms, and
B5) one or more olefinically unsaturated compounds which
are not included in B1, B2, B3 or B4,

wherein the copolymer possesses a number-average molar
mass M
n
 of below 5000 g/mol and a glass transistion
temperature which is above room temperature (20°C) at a 

heat-up rate of 10 K/min.
A copolymer as claimed in claim 1, which possesses
an OH number of from 40 to 250 mg of KOH/g, a number-average

molar mass M
n
 of less than 4000 g/mol and a
solution viscosity of from 10 to 2000 mPa·s (measured in

50 % strength solution at 23°C).
A copolymer as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
alcohol of component B2) is selected from cyclohexanol,

and citronellol.
A copolymer as claimed in claim 1, wherein component
(A) is selected from the glycidyl esters of 2,2-dimethylolpropionic

acid, neononanoic, neodecanoic and
neoundecanoic acid.
A process for the preparation of a copolymer as
claimed in claim 1, which comprises, in the reaction,

initially charging component (A), then adding components
(B) and one or more free-radical initiators, together or

each individually in bulk, and subjecting the batch to
conjoint polymerization.

production of coatings.
The use of a copolymer as claimed in claim 1 for the
production of intermediate coats or of pigmented or

unpigmented topcoats.

binder for coating materials, especially for high-solids

coating materials.
A coating material which comprises at least one
copolymer as claimed in claim 1 as binder component(s),

and which cures by crosslinking with polyisocyanates at
moderate temperatures or at room temperature.
The use of a copolymer as claimed in claim 1 for the
production of powder coatings.
