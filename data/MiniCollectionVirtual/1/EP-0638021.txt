<DESCRIPTION>
Wrist supportThis invention relates to a wrist support and especially to such a wrist support which is used to support a person's hand, arm or wrist when typing with a typewriting machine and especially with a keyboard of a computer or when using the mouse of a computer.Recently it has been noticed that writing with a computer and using of a mouse of a computer is, despite of its apparent easiness, work that causes high stress to certain parts of one's arm. Inflammations of the tendon and other complaints which are caused by static stress are often very painful and invalidating.To help the work with a computer there have been developed wrist supports of which a model which has the widest use includes a plate like member which lies under the keyboard and on the front part of which there is attached a pillow of foam plastics, on which the wrist can rest continuously or when needed. This solution is good and it has relieved the situation in respect of getting complaints but the same has couple of disadvantages. Namely, the hand is by no means on its place during typing but tends to move forward and backward, normally however, only quite little. Moving along the support surface causes, of course, galls on the part of the skin which is against the support surface and on the other hand the stresses of the shoulder area maintain nearly as severe as before because the muscles of the upper arm work to move the arm and the friction along the support surface resists the movement.US Patent specification 5,050,826 tries to solve this problem with a horizontal shaft having rotatable cylindrical support pads which can be moved along the shaft. Even though the apparatus has some advantages it, however, has also disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that the apparatus is quite expensive to manufacture. Another disadvantage is that the same is inevitably quite heavy as it is aimed to rest on a desk or table as it is. The support pads are also short and so the user of the pads must always relocate the pads to be in right position is respect of the wrists.It is the aim of this invention to achieve such a solution in the wrist support 

which is steady enough in the desired directions, but however, gives space to move the arms resting on it, whereby all extra stresses which would be directed to the hands of the person typing or using the mouse are minimized. The present invention gives a support that is also inexpensive to manufacture and always ready for use without any excessive steps to relocate any pads. The

Claims
1 . Wrist support intented to be as a support fot the hand, arm or wrist for a person working with computer terminal like typing with a keyboard or using a mouse or in corresponding situations where the wrist needs support, comprising a plate like base (1 ) and a support pillow (2) or the like fixed to the same, characterized of resilient parts (4, 9) with the assistance of which the upper part of the support pillow (2) has been connected to its lower part or directly to the base (1 ) so that the forward and/or backward movement of the upper part of the pillow with the hand is possible.
2. Support according to claim 1 , characterized in that the pillow (2) is formed of an upper part (6) and a Tower part (7) which are connected by a quite narrow, springy neck (4), which makes the movement of the part (6) in respect of the part (7) possible.
3. Support according to claim 1 , characterized in that the pillow (2) has a hollow (8) so that necks (4) are formed on both sides of the hollow, which necks make the movement of the upper part (6) in respect of the lower part possible.
4- Support according to claim 1 , characterized in that the pillow (2) has been connected to its base ( 1 ) with the assistance of a spring (9) which makes the movement of the pillow in respect of the base possible.
5. Support according to claim 1 , characterized in that it comprises two kinds of material, one kind of material being for the upper part (6) of the pillow and being comfortable against the skin and other kind of material being for the lower part of the pillow and having good springy or toughness properties.
