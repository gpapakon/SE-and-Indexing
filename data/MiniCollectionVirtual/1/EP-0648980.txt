<ABSTRACT>
The plate element includes a housing (2) having broad walls (4, 6) which are connected by narrow walls and are closed at the upper side by a cover (10). A collecting trough (12) is present at the underside. A main layer (14) is arranged in the housing. Present on at least one side of the plate element, between the main layer (14) and the broad wall (4), is a pipe system (16) which is connectable via a supply (18) and a discharge (20) to a fixed flow pipe and a return pipe. A heatable or coolable plate element which is of simple construction and is very mobile in use, which can be manufactured cost-effectively and is versatile, is thus created.
