<ABSTRACT>
A tool component comprises an abrasive compact layer (10, 30) bonded to 
a cemented carbide substrate (12, 32) along an interface (14, 34). The 

abrasive compact layer (10, 34) has a working surface (16, 36) on a side 
opposite to the interface (14, 34) which is flat and which presents a cutting 

edge or point on its periphery (18, 38). A recess (20, 40) is provided, that 
recess (20, 40) extending into the substrate (12, 32) from the interface (14, 

34). The recess (20, 40) has a shape, in plan, of at least two strips which 
intersect. Examples of suitable shapes are V-shape and cross-shape. 

Abrasive compact fills the recess (20, 40) and is bonded to the substrate (12, 
32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tool components comprising a composite abrasive
compact.Composite abrasive compacts consist of an abrasive compact layer bonded
to a substrate which is generally a cemented carbide substrate. The abrasive
compact layer comprises a mass of abrasive particles, typically diamond or
cubic boron nitride, bonded into a hard conglomerate. Such layers are
polycrystalline in nature and contain a high abrasive particle content.
Diamond compacts are also known as polycrystalline diamond or PCD.
Cubic boron nitride compacts are also known as polycrystalline cubic boron
nitride or PCBN.Composite abrasive compacts are manufactured under elevated temperature
and pressure conditions, e.g. diamond or cubic boron nitride synthesis
conditions.Composite abrasive compacts are used in a variety of cutting, drilling,
milling and other such operations. It is an edge or point formed on the
abrasive compact layer of such composite compacts which performs the
cutting, drilling, milling or other such operation. Composite diamond abrasive compacts are used extensively in drilling.
While they generally perform admirably in drilling, the diamond compact
layer does tend to spall or break under some of the stressful conditions
which can be encountered during drilling.United States Patent No. 4,861,350 describes a tool component in the form
of a composite abrasive compact wherein the abrasive compact has two
zones which are joined by an interlocking, common boundary. The one zone
provides the cutting edge or point for the tool component, while the other
zone is bonded to a cemented carbide substrate. In one embodiment, the
cemented carbide substrate has a central portion extending into the abrasive
compact defining a peripheral abrasive compact stepped region surrounding
the central portion.United States Patent No. 5,007,207 discloses a tool insert comprising an
abrasive compact bonded to a cemented carbide support. The cutting edge
of the tool is provided by the periphery of the compact. A plurality of
circular concentric recesses, each filled with abrasive compact material,
extend into the cemented carbide support from the compact/carbide interface.
The compact-filled grooves are designed to provide, in use, groove-type
cutting regions. US-A-4 784 023,
upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based,
discloses a cutting element comprising a stud and a composite bonded
thereto. In turn, the composite comprises a substrate formed of cemented carbide, and a
PCD layer bonded to the carbide substrate. The interface
