<ABSTRACT>
An end of stroke cushion for a linear hydraulic motor. A 
piston-cylinder unit includes a cylinder body (42) reciprocally 

slidable on a piston rod (40) having a piston head (64) which 
defines working chambers (82, 84) within the cylinder body 

(42). The piston rod (62) is tubular and includes a plurality 
of sidewall ports (P1-P7). A radially-expandable annular valve 

ring (106) normally snugly surrounds the piston rod (62) and 
during axial movement of the cylinder body (42) relative to the 

piston rod (62), the valve ring (106) will move axially 
relative to the sidewall ports (P1-P7) in the piston rod (62). 

Pressure introduction to the working chamber (84) through the 
sidewall ports (P1-P7) of the piston rod (62) and against the 

valve ring (106) radially expands the valve ring (106). This 
allows oil flow to move into the working chamber (84) such that 

when the chamber (84) expands, the cylinder body (42) and valve 
ring (106) will move axially relative to the sidewall ports 

(P1-P7), successively uncovering the ports (P1-P7) during 
movement. Removal of fluid from the working chamber (84) will 

cause oil movement out from the chamber (84), through the 
sidewall ports (P1-P7) into the tubular piston rod (62) such 

that when the linear motor (10) approaches the end of its 
stroke, the valve ring will close the sidewall ports (P1-P7) 

in the piston rod (62) which allows oil flow out from the 
working chamber (84) in succession.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to linear hydraulic motors. 
More particularly, it relates to the provision of a linear 
hydraulic motor which includes a valve mechanism which slows 
down movement as the drive unit approaches the end of stroke 
and provides an oil cushion at the end of the stroke so that 
there is no metal-to-metal contact of the cylinder body 
component with the piston component which together make up the 
drive unit. A linear hydraulic motor can be damaged if there is contact 
between the cylinder body and the piston component at the end 
of a stroke. Even if there is no damage, the metal-to-metal 
contact can produce a noise which is disturbing to anyone in 
the vicinity who would hear it. To avoid damage, load 
alleviation devices are often built into the motors. Examples 
of these devices, which have been termed buffers, snubbers and 
dashpots, are disclosed in the text "Hydraulic System 
Analysis", by George R. Keller, and published by the editors 
of Hydraulics & Pneumatics Magazine, Library of Congress 
Catalog Card No: 78-52991, on pages 130-133. Of particular 
interest is the snubbing technique shown by Fig. 9.20 on page 
132. From US-A-5 193 661 a linear motor as described in the 
preamble of claim 1 and elucidated in fig. 1 of this 
application is known. According to the invention there is provided a linear 
hydraulic motor as defined in claim 1. The present invention provides a novel end of stroke 
cushion for a linear hydraulic motor. The invention includes 
a piston-cylinder unit having a cylinder body reciprocally 
slidable on a piston rod. The piston rod includes a piston 
head defining a working fluid chamber within the cylinder body. 
The piston rod is tubular and includes a plurality of sidewall 
ports. A radially-expandable annular valve ring normally 
snugly surrounds the piston rod. During axial movement of the 
cylinder body relative to the piston rod, the valve ring will  
 
move axially relative to the sidewall ports in the piston rod. 
Pressure introduction to the working chamber through the 
tubular piston rod causes oil to flow through the sidewall 
ports of the piston rod and against the valve ring. This 
radially expands the valve ring and allows the oil flow to move 
into the working chamber such that when the chamber expands, 
the cylinder body and valve ring will move axially relative to 
the sidewall ports. This successively uncovers the ports 
during movement. Removal of fluid from the working chamber 
will cause oil movement out from the chamber,

A linear hydraulic motor (10), comprising: 

a cylinder body (38) having a cylindrical sidewall (42), 
an at least substantially closed end (44), and an open end 

(46); 
a cylinder head (48) in the open end (46), said cylinder 
head (48) including a central passageway and an annular valve 

ring chamber (94) surrounding said passageway; 
a piston component (40) having a piston rod (62) which 
extends through said passageway and a piston head (64) that is 

positioned axially between the cylinder head (48) and the 
closed end (44) of the cylinder body (38), with a first working 

chamber (82) being defined axially between the piston head (64) 
and the closed end (44) of the cylinder body (38), and a second 

working chamber (84) being formed axially between the piston 
head (64) and the cylinder head (48); 
characterized in that
said piston rod (62) being tubular and forming a first 
fluid passageway (80), and said piston rod (62) having a 

plurality of sidewall ports (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) 
communicating with said first fluid passageway (80); 
a second fluid passageway which communicates with the first 
working chamber (82); 
a valve ring (106) in the valve ring chamber (94), said 
valve ring (106) being annular and radially expandable, said 

valve ring (106) normally snugly surrounding the piston rod 
(62), and said valve ring chamber (94) having a radial 

dimension permitting radial expansion of the valve ring (106); 
and 
wherein during axial movement of the cylinder body (38) 
relative to the piston component (40), the valve ring (106) 

will move axially relative to the sidewall ports (P1, P2, P3, 
P4, P5, P6, P7) in the piston rod (62); 
wherein pressure introduction into the first fluid 
passageway (80) while the second fluid passageway is connected 

to return will cause oil to flow out from the first working 
chamber (82) through the second fluid passageway and oil to 

flow through the sidewall ports (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7)  
 

of the piston rod (62) and against the valve ring (106), to 
expand the valve ring (106), and allow the oil flow to move 

into the second working chamber (84), causing expansion of the 
second working chamber (84) a
nd contraction of the first 
working chamber (82); and 
wherein pressure introduction into the second fluid 
passageway while the first fluid passageway (80) is connected 

to return will cause oil movement out from the second working 
chamber (84), through the sidewall ports (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, 

P6, P7) into the first fluid passageway (80), and oil 
introduction into the first working chamber (82), attended by 

an increase in volume in the first working chamber (82) and a 
decrease in volume of the second working chamber (84) ; and

its stroke the valve ring (106) will close in succession the

(62) which allow oil flow out from the second working chamber 

(84); and 
wherein the last sidewall port (P1) is positioned such that 
it is closed and further oil flow out from the second working 

chamber (84) is prohibited before there is contact between the
