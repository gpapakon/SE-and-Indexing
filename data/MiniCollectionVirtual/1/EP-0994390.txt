<ABSTRACT>
A control tool and method for calibrating a photographic printer
and a photographic processor. The tool comprises an exposed unprocessed

photographic filmstrip having a first image section for use in calibrating a
photographic printer and a second image section for use in calibrating a

photographic processor with respect to a predetermined aim. The first image
section comprises a plurality of exposures of the same image, each image having a

different exposure level, and the second image section comprising a plurality of
density patches, each having a different exposure level. The exposed tool is

developed so to determine the exposure levels. The exposure levels are compared
with predetermined aims. The tool is printed if the measured data is within

prescribed limits, or the film processor is adjusted in accordance with corrective
measures if the measured data is outside said prescribed limits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a tool for monitoring and
controlling a photographic processor and photographic printer in a typical
processing facility or laboratory.A typical wholesale photofinishing lab or facility currently use
monitoring systems which are fragmented, costly, technically cumbersome and not
representative of the specific operation parameters or customers/markets served by
the photofinishing laboratory or facility.Current monitoring systems for monitoring film processors and
printers in a typical photofinishing facility are done daily, but in separate non-linked
steps. A film processor is typically monitored through the use of a film
process tool, which comprises an exposed strip of film which contains a plurality
of patches of varying densities. Once the exposures have been developed, the
density of the patches are measured and compared to aims. Deviations from the
aim indicate if the chemicals are performing as required. If measured densities
vary beyond predetermined parameters, corrective action is typically taken.
Though the standards established may well represent technically well derived
aims, they usually bear little similarity to the equipment, chemistry, or the
configuration that exists in the particular lab environment.Currently there exists an array of printer setup and printer balancing
kits available from various film manufacturers and other quality tool suppliers,
most, if not all, embody a set of processed negatives and various common film
types in a standard or referenced print for setup comparison. A typical printer
setup tool comprises calibrated negatives that when printed or matched to aims to
determine correct output. Particularly, each negative has an area for measuring the
print density, which is compared to aim. Printer setups are changed to make prints
at the aimed density by making adjustments to exposure to compensate for the
deviation from aim. Printer setup tools may be processed by the manufacturer or 
by the photofinishing lab depending upon the type of tool being used. Since tools
are being provided by the manufacturer, the setup obtained by the tool may not be
representative of current film coatings processed through the processing lab, or
may be printed on paper stock which is different from the one currently used in the
photofinishing lab and prepared on a printer and processor, not some other system
being set up for control.In addition to the foregoing problems, in a typical photofinishing
lab the film process condition is not monitored at the

<CLAIMS>
A control tool (10) for use in calibrating a photographic printer
and a photographic processor, comprising:


an exposed unprocessed photographic filmstrip having a first image
section for use in calibrating a photographic printer and a second image section for

use in calibrating a photographic processor with respect to a predetermined aim,
said first image section comprising a plurality of exposures (20-26) of the same image,

each image having a different predetermined exposure level, said second image section
comprising a plurality of density patches, each having a different predetermined exposure level.
The control tool according to claim 1 wherein said plurality
of exposures of the same image comprises four exposures.
The control tool according to claim 2 wherein said four
exposures comprise:


a first normal exposure of the image, a two stop underexposed
exposure of the image, a two and a half stop overexposed exposure of the image

and a five stop overexposed exposure of the image.
A control tool according to claim 1 wherein said plurality of
density patches comprises five.
A control tool according to claim 4 wherein said five
density patches comprise a D-min density patch, a low density patch, a high

density patch, a D-max density patch and a yellow patch.
A control tool according to claim 1 adapted to
calibrate a film processor. 
A method of calibrating a photographic processor and a
photographic printer which uses the photographic material from said photographic

processor, the method comprising steps of:

a) providing an exposed unprocessed photographic filmstrip (10)
having a first image section for use in calibrating a photographic printer and a

second image section for use in calibrating a photographic processor with respect
to a predetermined aim, said first image section comprising a plurality of exposure (20-26)

of the same image, each having a different predetermined exposure level, said second image
section comprising a plurality of density patches (12-16), each having a different predetermined exposure

level;
b) processing said exposed unprocessed photographic filmstrip in
said processor;
c) measuring said developed photographic film so to
determine the exposure level;
d) comparing the measured exposure levels with respect to
predetermined aims; and
e) printing said processed photographic film if said measured
data is within prescribed limits, and adjusting said film processor in accordance

with corrective measures provided for said measured data if said measured data is
outside said prescribed limits.
The method according to claim 7 further comprising the
step of determining the printer adjustment parameters based on said photographic

measured data in said image section if said measured data of said second image
section is within said prescribed limits.
The method according to claim 8 wherein the printer
adjustment comprises adjusting the color balance and/or slope of the printer.
