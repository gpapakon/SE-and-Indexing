<ABSTRACT>
A switching device, in particular a circuit breaker, such as a line protection circuit breaker, at least one of whose switching contacts (2, 3) is connected, as a moving contact (3) via a kinematic system (4) which may be part of a latching mechanism (5), to a manual operating device (6), and whose contact erosion can be compensated for by means of an adjustable excess movement. It is provided, that, in the kinematic system (4), one element interacts as a clamping lever (9) with the moving contact (3), in that the clamping lever (9) or moving contact (3) has, in a stiff basic structure (33, cf. FIG 9), a web which can bend out as an adjusting web (10) which rests, by means of an engagement body (11), on an associated bearing edge (12) when the contacts (2, 3) are in the open position.

<CLAIMS>
A switching device, more particularly a protective 
switch, such as a protective circuit breaker, at 

least one switching contact (2, 3) of which is 
constructed as a movable contact (3), which is 

movable via kinematics (4), can form part of a 
locking cam (5), is connected to a manual actuating 

member (6) and whose contact wear can be compensated 
by means of an adjustable excess stroke,
 
characterised in that in the kinematic system (4) a 

member cooperates as a tensioning lever (9) with the 
movable contact (3), in that the tensioning lever 

(9) or movable contact (3) comprises a deflectable 
web acting as an adjusting web (10) in a rigid base 

structure (33), the adjusting web resting by means 
of an engagement element (11) against an associated 

bearing edge (12) when the contacts (2, 3) are in 
the open position. 
A switching device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the engagement element (11) is 

constructed as a moulded part of the movable contact 
(3). 
A switching device according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the tensioning lever (9) 

guides the movable contact (3) about a pivot axis 
(24), the movable contact (3) extending on either 

side of its pivot axis (24) with two limbs, one of 
which comprises the contact point of the contact 

element (14) and the other limb forming the 
engagement element (11) for engaging with the 

adjusting web (10) of the tensioning lever (9). 
A switching device according to claim 2 constructed 
as a protective switch, characterised in that the  

 
movable contact (3) forms a region of action (17) 

for an armature (18). 
A switching device according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the movable contact (3) forms 

a driving region as an area of action (17) for a 
plunger-type armature. 
A switching device according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the movable contact (3) 

comprises a structure having two planes at least in 
the region of the tensioning lever (9), which planes 

are connected by at least one bridge (21), a first 
structural part (19) extending in one plane and the 

other, second structural part (20) in the other 
plane forming the engagement element as a moulded 

part for resting against the adjusting web (10) of 
the tensioning lever (9). 
A switching device according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that the bridge (21) is U-shaped. 
A switching device according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that the engagement element (11) of 

the movable contact (3) for resting against the 
adjusting web (10) of the tensioning lever (9) is 

constructed as a recessed lug in the second 
structural part (20), against which lug the 

tensioning lever (9) is pressed under spring force. 
A switching device according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that the tensioning lever comprises 

a structure in two planes, the two structural parts 
(25, 26) being connected by a bridge (27), and the 

tensioning lever (9) guiding the movable contact (3) 
about a pivot axis (24), which is held between these 

structural parts, the compression spring (22) acting  
 

upon the pivot axis (24) bringing the recessed lug 
in the structural part of the movable contact (3) 

into abutment with the adjusting web (10) of the 
tensioning lever. 
A switching device according to claim 9,
 
characterised in that the compression spring (22) is 

simultaneously constructed as a torsion spring, 
which braces the tensioning lever (9) and movable 

contact (3) and generates the contact force. 
A switching device according to claim 10,
 
characterised in that a second torsion spring (23) 

is arranged on the pivot axis (24), which braces the 
tensioning lever (9) and the movable contact (3) and 

which, together with the first rotary spring (22) 
simultaneously acting as a compression spring, 

generates the contact force. 
A switching device according to claim 6 or one of 
claims 7 to 11, characterised in that the first 

structural part (19) of the movable contact (3) 
forms an abutment (30) for a locking rod (28), which 

is articulatedly connected to the manual actuating 
member (6) and effects a locking position for the 

movable contact (3) on its path of engagement with 

the fixed contact, which locking position is 
released by the locking rod (28) prior to the end of 

the engagement movement. 
A switching device according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that, on one of its structural 

parts (19, 20) in the vicinity of its pivot axis 
(24), the movable contact (3) forms a lug (32), to 

which conductors can be welded.
