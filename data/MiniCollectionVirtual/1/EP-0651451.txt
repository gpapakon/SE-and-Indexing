<ABSTRACT>
The electrode comprises a metal substrate and a coated 
layer of an active material provided on one or both faces of the 

substrate. The metal substrate is a metal sheet having a 
plurality of punched holes. The punched holes have burrs along 

their peripheries so that the apparent thickness including the 
burrs is at least twice the original thickness of the metal 

sheet. The burrs improve the engagement between the metal 
substrate and the coated layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage battery and, more
particularly, to an electrode used for an alkaline storage battery and a method
for producing the same.A typical positive electrode of an alkaline storage battery is a nickel
electrode. This electrode may be a sintered type electrode or a non-sintered
type electrode. In producing the former type of electrode, a microporous
sintered plaque obtained by sintering nickel powder is impregnated with an
aqueous solution of nickel nitrate or the like thereby to add nickel salt, and.
after drying, the sintered plaque is immersed in caustic alkali aqueous solution
to convert the nickel salt to nickel hydroxide. This method has the
disadvantage that the process is complicated and the filling density of nickel
hydroxide as an active material is reduced in comparison with the non-sintered
electrode described later. In spite of this disadvantage, this electrode has a
highly efficient discharge characteristic and a long cycle life, and finds wide
application in a variety of fields.A non-sintered electrode has previously been of a pocket type.
According to a method recently put into practice, on the other hand. nickel
hydroxide powder as a powder of active material directly fills a foamed-nickel
porous material. This method is a simple method of electrode production.
Further, the availability of a foamed-nickel porous material of high porosity
makes it possible to fill it with nickel hydroxide to a high density and
therefore a high-capacity battery can be produced. The foamed-nickel porous
material, however, needs to be produced 
by electroplating and therefore has the disadvantage of high
material cost.In view of this, a non-sintered electrode is under
development using a low-cost punched metal or expanded metal in
place of the foamed-nickel porous material as an electrode
support. These electrode supports have no three-dimensional
structure unlike the sintered plaque or the foamed-nickel porous
material. As a result, an electrode made of these electrode
supports has a low ability to hold an active material and the
active material is liable to fall off during electrode
fabrication or repeated charging and discharging. Further, due
to the low electronic conductivity in the electrode thickness
direction and a poor electrode characteristic, these electrode
supports find no practical applications except for special types
of electrodes.The above-mentioned method of electrode production using a
punched metal or expanded metal as an electrode support has the
advanta
