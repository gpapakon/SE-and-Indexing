<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides liquid, 
destructible fluorinated nonionic surfactants that are 

water-soluble or dispersible, that are useful as 
stabilizers for emulsions, and that on curing as a 

layer on a substrate can provide the substrate with an 
oil- and water-repellent coating that is free of 

surfactant, the destructible surfactant comprising a 
fluorocarbylalkoxysilane having at least one 

polyfluorinated aliphatic group that is both 
hydrophobic and oleophobic and at least one, preferably 

two, polyoxyalkylene or other hydrophilic groups which 
can be cleaved from the hydrophobe by hydrolysis. More 

particularly, a fluorocarbylalkoxysilane comprises at 
least one polyfluorinated aliphatic group and at least 

one polyoxyalkylene group or other hydrophilic group, 
said fluorocarbylalkoxysilane being destructible by 

hydrolysis. 
The invention further provides an aqueous 
composition for providing a substrate with an oil and 

water repellent coating comprising the 
fluorocarbylalkoxysilane of the invention as well as a 

process for providing a substrate with an oil and water 
repellent coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reactive nonionic 
surfactants and to compositions containing the reactive 
nonionic surfactants. The compositions when coated on 
a substrate and cured can provide both water and oil 
repellency to the substrate. Surfactants are well known compounds that are used 
in many fields for providing low surface tension 
resulting in increased wettability, spreadability, 
emulsifiability, dispersibility, penetrability, and 
improved adhesion. All surfactants are comprised of a hydrophobic 
segment, a hydrophilic segment, and a connecting 
linkage of intermediate polarity joining the two 
segments together. Surfactants are classified as 
cationic, anionic, amphoteric, or nonionic depending on 
whether the hydrophilic segment contains, respectively, 
a cationic group, an anionic group, both a cationic and 
an anionic group, or a nonionic hydrophilic group. The 
nonionic hydrophilic segment, generally, is a 
polyoxyalkylene group, such as the product of 
oligomerization of ethylene oxide, but may also be a 
polyhydroxylated group such as sorbitol or glycerol, 
their alkyl ether derivatives, or their polyoxyalkylene 
derivatives. Amine oxide surfactants are also 
classified as nonionic, having only formal charges in 
the N-O hydrophile. The hydrophobic segment has  
 
generally been a long chain hydrocarbyl group, a 
polyfluorinated aliphatic group, or a polysiloxane 
group. Examples of nonionic surfactants having, for 
instance, a linear or branched, alkyl or alkylaryl, 
hydrocarbyl hydrophobic segment and a polyethylene 
oxide hydrophilic segment where the two segments are 
joined by an ether connecting linkage are known as 
Tergitol 15-S-X™ and Triton CF™ (Union Carbide, 
Danbury, CT). The general structural formula for these 
surfactants is as below: 
R-O-(CH₂-CH₂O)n-Hwherein R is a C₈ to C₂₀ hydrocarbyl group and n is a 
number having a value from about 3 to 40 or more. 
Coatings made from compositions containing such a 
surfactant would be more hydrophilic than a coating 
made in its absence since the surfactant would remain 
in the coated film upon drying and not be removed 
except possibly by copious washing with water. Such 
surfactants would also be categorized as chemically 
stable, resisting all but the most severe acid, base or 
enzymatically catalyzed destructive processes. Loss of 
such surfactants in the waste streams from treatment 
baths constitutes a serious environmental problem, 
particularly when the hydrophobe is polyfluorinated. Destructible nonionic surfactants
