<ABSTRACT>
An associative memory is capable of performing at 
high speed a registration of unregistered data. Retrieval 

data is stored at the same time when a retrieval is carried 
out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a content addressable 
memory or an associative memory comprising a number of word 
memories each for storing data, and having such a function 
that match or mismatch between data stored in word memories 
and retrieval data inputted to the word memories are 
retrieved. Recently, there has been proposed an associative 
memory provided with the retrieval function as mentioned 
above. First, there will be described arrangements and 
functions of the associative memory, and then examples of the 
field of application of the associative memory. Fig. 9 is a circuit block diagram of the conventional 
associative memory by way of example. Referring to Fig. 9, an associative memory 10 is 
provided with a number of word memories 11a, 11b, ··· , 11n 
each consisting of a 5-bit of serial memory cell by way of 
example. Further, the associative memory 10 comprises a  
 
retrieval register 12 which is arranged to receive and latch 
a word of retrieval data. A bit pattern of the retrieval 
data latched in the retrieval register 12 in its entirety or 
in a part specified is compared with a bit pattern of the 
portion corresponding to the bit pattern of the latched 
retrieval data with respect to data stored in each of the 
word memories 11a, 11b, ··· , 11n. As a result of the 
comparison, if there are found any of the word memories 
11a,11b,··· , 11n of which the bit pattern matches with that 
of the retrieval data, a match signal given by a logic "1" 
will appear on the associated ones of match lines 14a, 14b, ··· 
, 14n which are provided in conjunction with the word 
memories 11a, 11b, ··· , 11n, respectively. On the other 
hand, a mismatch signal given by a logic "0" will appear on 
the remaining ones of the match lines 14a, 14b, ... , 14n. Assuming that the signals "0", "1", "0", "0", "1" ··· , 
"0" appear on the flag lines 14a, 14b, ··· , 14n, respectively, 
these signals are applied to a priority encoder 15. The 
priority encoder 15 is so arranged to output an address 
signal AD corresponding to the match line given with a 
highest priority among the match lines (here, two match lines 
14b and 14e) on which the match signal given by a logic "1" 
appears. Supposing that the priority is higher as alphabet 
of a suffix of the reference character becomes younger, in  
 
this case, the match line 14b is selected as the highest 
priority match line. Thus, the priority encoder 15 outputs 
an address signal AD corresponding to the highest priority 
match line 14b, which address signal AD

<CLAIMS>
An associative memory comprising at least one 
word memory for storing data, and at least one match detection 

circuit associated with said word memory for detecting a 
match or mismatch between a whole or a predetermined partial 

bit pattern of an entered retrieval data and a whole or a 
part of bit pattern corresponding to said bit pattern of the 

retrieval data among data stored in said word memory, further 
comprising: 

   a data additional writing circuit for providing such 
a control that when none of said match detection circuits 

does not output a match signal indicative of detection of a 
match, the retrieval data is stored in one of the word 

memories, which do not store effective data as a retrieval 
object and thus reside in an empty state permitting an 

overwriting, among said word memories. 
An associative memory according to claim 1, 
wherein said data additional writing circuit comprises: 

   at least one flag register associated with said word 
memory for storing a flag indicative of whether the 

associated word memory is one residing in a storage state 
 

such that said effective data is stored therein or another 
one residing in said empty state; 

   a retrieval data writing circuit for selecting one 
word memory from among the word memories residing in said 

empty state to write said retrieval data in the selected word 
memory; and 

   a flag alteration circuit for causing said flag 
register associated with said one word memory to store a flag 

indicative of said storage state, when none of said match 
detection circuits does not output the match signal. 
An associative memory having a plurality of word 
memory groups each comprising a plurality of word memories 

for storing a plurality of data constituting a single data 
group consisting of a plurality of storage data, wherein 

whenever retrieval data is entered, there is conducted a 
match retrieval between a whole or a predetermined partial 

bit pattern of an entered retrieval data and a whole or a 
part of bit pattern corresponding to said bit pattern of the 

retrieval data among data stored in said word memory, and in 
a predetermined number of times of match retrieval, including 

one time or a plurality of continuous number of times, the 
presence of the data group associated with the retrieval data 

entered said predetermined number of times is detected 
 

through detection of a match between a whole or a respective 
predetermined partial bit pattern of the entered retrieval 

data and a whole or a part of bit pattern corresponding to 
said bit pattern of the retrieval data among data stored in a 

same said word memory group throughout said predetermined 
number of times of match retrieval, said associative memory 

comprising: 
   a data writing circuit for writing the entered data, 

every retrieval during said predetermined number of times of 
match retrieval, in any one of the word memories within one 

word memory group selected from among the word memory groups 
which do not store effective data group as retrieval object 

and thus reside in an empty state permitting an overwriting. 
An associative memory according to claim 3, 
further comprising: 

   a plurality of flag registers each corresponding to 
an associated one of said plurality of word memory groups, 

for storing a flag indicative of whether the associated word 
memory group is one residing in a storage state such that 

said effective data group is stored therein or another one 
residing in said empty state; and 

   a flag alteration circuit for causing said flag 
register associated with said one word memory group to store

said effective data group is stored therein or another one 
residing in said empty state; and

predetermined instruction signal entered from an exterior for 

causing said flag register associated with said one word 
memory group to store a flag indicative of said storage state.
