<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED COMPUTERIZED AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE SYSTEMBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONComputerized automotive service and diagnostic equipment systems for measuring or testing various parameters and for providing maintenance or repair procedure instructions to an operator are generally known. Such systems utilize a central control processor and various data input and storage means including, for example, vehicle-mounted instrument sensors, manual data input consoles, and electronically-stored databases.Systems that utilize vehicle-mounted instruments enable sensors or measuring devices in the instruments to provide measurement signals to a central processor for comparison with data or computation of vehicle conditions. In addition to providing input or measured data, vehicle-mounted sensors enable live or real-time monitoring ofvarious conditions.Measured data and operator-input data provided through, for example, a keyboard or similar means, can be compared to pre-stored data or parameters calculated from one or more of pre-stored data, measured data, or user-input data. Data and computed or measured results can be compared to known, pre-stored data for specific makes and models of vehicles or parts to identify conditions or to diagnose problems. Possible problems and conditions are pre-stored in the memory of the computer and are displayed or presented to the operator via a display screen or printer. 

 In addition, such systems can include step-by-step adjustment or repair procedure instructions displayed in response to measured or input data in order to guide an operator or technician through an adjustment or repair procedure.The present invention relates to computerized vehicle servicing and diagnostic systems and, more particularly, to such systems that communicate with or access remotely located computers |via the Internet that have pre-stored data or that utilize pre- stored data and parameters. A further aspect of the invention relates to utilizing the same to access remotely located computers that are interfaced with other equipment or human operators for real-time or frequently updated information.The present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for the exchange and sharing of information on the Internet. The popularity of the Internet has promoted development of improved standards in communication technology. One such standard is "HTTP" or Hypertext Transmission Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol that allows information to flow through the World Wide Web of the Internet.

save and view the Wizard files. The operator can select from all available vehicle service equipment processes and insert them into a desired sequence. An end user or service provider can customize the Wizard's step properties for specific conditions.
While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been herein disclosed and described, it is realized that various modifications can be made to the presently disclosed embodiments without departing from the essence of the presently claimed invention.
WE CLAIM:
1) A vehicle service system for measuring vehicle characteristics and for providing output relating to said characteristics comprising control means for providing operating instructions and for receiving data; vehicle characteristic measuring means adapted to communicate with said control means; access means for accessing remotely located computers enabling transfer of information and executable signals between said control means and at least one said remotely located computers.
2) The system of claim 1 , wherein said access means comprise hypertext transmission protocol. 


3) The system of claim 1, wherein said system is directed to a vehicle wheel alignment system.
4) A vehicle service system for measuring vehicle characteristics and for providing output relating to said characteristics comprising control means for providing operating instructions and for receiving data; vehicle characteristic measuring means adapted to communicate with said control means; whereby said control means operate on a 32-Bit operating system.
