<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid state laser gain media, 
more particularly to solid state laser gain media composed of 
segments having different doping levels. Pumping - especially longitudinal pumping with a single 
wavelength pump source - of uniformly doped laser hosts tends 
to cause non-uniform heating, leading to internal 
stress/strain within the host where the outer surfaces are 
cooled except for the end faces. Because of the exponential 
decay of the transmission function, the intensity I of a beam 
transversing a crystal is 
I = Ioe(-αl)  
where Io is the initial input, α is the absorption 
coefficient at a given pump wavelength and l is the distance 
along the crystal. Absorbed energy translates into heat. 
Thus, much more energy (heat) is deposited at the entrance 
end of the host than further into the crystal. For example, 
in tests with 6.35 and 5 mm diameter uniformly doped 
Cr+3:LiSrAlF6 ("Cr:LiSAF") rods of approximately 6 cm length, 
the input end of the rods shattered at 15-18 Watts input 
levels when almost all of the pump energy was absorbed. 
Stress/strain calculations and thermal deposition profiles 
indicated large areas of stress/strain due to high thermal 
gradients due to exterior surface cooling except for the 
endfaces, and poor thermo-mechanical material properties. 
This can lead to catastrophic failure of the crystal without 
prior warning as the input power is increased. Longitudinal 
pumping of a uniformly doped host can also cause localized 
thermal augmentation due to Excited State Absorption (ESA)  
 
and upconversion processes, both of which are exacerbated by 
uneven pump energy absorption in accordance with the above-stated 
absorption formula. Further, the fluorescence lifetime 
in these crystals is strongly temperature dependent near room 
temperature, resulting in reduced stored energy in higher 
temperature areas and lower quantum efficiency, producing 
more localized heat. We have found that the problems of unequal heat build-up 
in laser gain media can be ameliorated by providing a gradient 
doping level in the pumping direction within the laser gain 
medium, with the lower dopant concentration at the entrance 
end of the gain medium, followed by sections of increasing 
dopant concentration along the length of the gain medium, 
such that the input beam is gradually absorbed as it 
propagates toward the opposite exit end having the higher 
dopant concentration. In accordance with the present 
invention, this is accomplished by providing a laser gain 
medium,
