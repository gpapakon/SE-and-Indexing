<ABSTRACT>
This method of manufacture of a steering wheel, of the type including a wheel frame (1) provided with an open cavity (dish) (2) for holding at least one folded air bag (3) and a plastic fitment (5), is characterised in that it includes the following steps:     - a steering wheel (1) with the holder cavity (2) is produced;   - at least the folded air bag (3) is arranged in the cavity (2); - the opening of the cavity (2) is closed off using a sealing material (4) which can be torn away when inflating the bag; - the frame with its cavity (2) provided with the bag (3) and with the sealing material (4) is arranged in a mould for manufacturing the fitment by plastic injection; and - plastic is injected into the mould in order to form the fitment around the frame (5).

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a steering wheel, in particular 
for a motor vehicle, of the type comprising a steering wheel 

frame (1) provided with an open cup (2) for receiving at least 
an inflatable bag (3) in its folded state and a padding (5) made 

of a plastic material, characterized in that it comprises the 
following steps: 


the steering wheel frame (1) is made together with the 
receiving cup (2); 
at least the inflatable bag (3) is disposed in its folded 
state in the cup; 
the opening of the cup (2) is obturated by means of a sealing 
material (4), tearable during the inflation of the bag; 
the steering wheel frame together with its cup (2) provided 
with the bag (3) and the sealing material (4) are placed 

into a mould for producing the padding by the injection 
moulding of a plastic material; and 
plastic material is injected into the mould for forming the 
padding (5) round the frame. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
opening of the cup is obturated by means of a film (4) of a 

sealing material. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the steering wheel frame together with its cup are obtained by 

the injection moulding of an alloy in a mould.
