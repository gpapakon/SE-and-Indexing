<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal
head apparatus used in a thermal printer and, more
particularly, to a compact, low-cost thermal head
apparatus.A thermal printer has a simple mechanism, and
a thermal printer having a large number of heat
generation elements serving as recording elements can be
easily manufactured. For this reason, the thermal
printer is popularly used. In the thermal printer, a
thermal head apparatus constituted by heat generation
elements and a driving circuit therefor is arranged.Fig. 5 shows a conventional thermal head
apparatus. This thermal head apparatus is constituted
by 64 heat generation elements R1 to R64 and a heat
generation driving integrated circuit 80, and the heat
generation elements R1 to R64 and the heat generation
driving integrated circuit 80 are formed on a single
thermal head base 81. The heat generation driving
integrated circuit 80 is constituted by a shift register
unit 801, a latch unit 802, an output gate unit 803, and
64 output transistors Q1 to Q64, and each of the shift
register unit 801, the latch unit 802, and the output 
gate unit 803 has output terminals corresponding to
64 bits. The heat generation driving integrated circuit
80 is arranged as described above to reduce the number
of wiring lines between the thermal head apparatus and
an external control circuit. In addition, the thermal
head base 81 is constituted by, e.g., an alumina ceramic
board or the like.Print data is input as 1-line serial data
(Serial-in) but not as 64-bit parallel data to the shift
register unit 801 synchronized with a clock signal
Clock. The print data is transmitted to the latch unit
802 at the timing of a latch signal (Latch). Only while
a strobe signal (Strobe) is set at L level, the output
gate unit 803 turns on each output transistor, of the
output transistors Q1 to Q64, corresponding to each heat
generation element, of the heat generation elements R1
to R64, which receives an H-level output from the latch
unit 802. For this reason, the heat generation elements
R1 to R64 are driven in correspondence with H-level
print data. In this manner, a thermal head apparatus
having several hundreds to several thousands heat
generation elements is arranged such that the number of
wiring lines between the thermal head apparatus and an
external circuit is considerably small.However, in this conventional thermal head
apparatus, a problem on print quality is posed. That
is, low-density printing is performed immediately after 
printing is started, and, as the printing
