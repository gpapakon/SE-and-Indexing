<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal reproducing
apparatus and, particularly, to a signal reproducing
apparatus suitable to reproduce a plurality of signals of
various kinds simultaneously from a recording medium on
which the plurality of the signals obtained by dividing a
video signal are recorded.Fig. 1 shows a conventional tape pattern and Fig. 2 is
a block diagram showing a conventional video signal reproducing
apparatus. Conventional techniques will be described
with reference to these figures.In a conventional video signal reproducing apparatus
(referred to as "VTR", hereinafter), one track is formed per
one video field as shown in Fig. 1 by using a pair of
magnetic heads H1 and H2 arranged on a rotary drum with a
space of 180 degrees therebetween.An auto-tracking has been known, in which, in reproducing
signals on a magnetic tape T, a tracking is performed on
the basis of an amplitude level of a reproduced signal. A
VTR which performs such tracking will be described with
reference to Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, signals reproduced from the
magnetic tape T by means of the magnetic heads H1 and H2 are 
supplied to a selecting circuit 3 through preamplifiers 1
and 2. Since the recorded signal is reproduced by the
magnetic heads H1 and H2 arranged on the rotary drum with a
space of 180Â° therebetween, when one of the preamplifiers 1
and 2 outputs a signal, the other preamplifier does not.
The selecting circuit 3 selects these output signals of the
preamplifiers by using drum pulse which is synchronous with
rotation of the rotary drum to form a continuous signal
which is supplied to a reproduced signal processing circuit
4 and a rectifier circuit 5. The reproduced signal
processing circuit 4 sends a reproduced video signal 4a
obtained by demodulating an FM modulated video signal to a
transmission line which is not shown.On the other hand, the output signal of the selecting
circuit 3, which is supplied to the rectifier circuit 5, is
half-wave or full-wave rectified thereby and then filtered
by an integration circuit 6 to remove its high frequency
component, resulting in an amplitude level detection signal
6a corresponding to an amplitude level of the reproduced
signal. The amplitude level detection signal 6a is supplied
to an operation circuit 7 composed of such as CPU to produce
a control signal 7a such that the amplitude level detection
signal 6a becomes maximum and the control signal 7a is
supplied to a capstan servo control system which is not
shown and which controls a running speed of the magnetic
tape
