<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITUTED PHENYLETHENYL COMPOUNDS HAVINGRETINOID-LIKE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention is directed to novel compounds which have retinoic acid-like biological activity. More specifically, the present invention relates to 1,2 diphenylalkene (stilbene) derivatives having a 1,3 (meta) or 1,2 (ortho) substituted phenyl ethenyl portion, and a second substituted phenyl portion. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to methods of using the compounds and compositions.2. Related ArtUnited States Patent No. 4,326,055 discloses ethene derivatives which have a substituted phenyl ring and a substituted indane or tetrahydronaphtalene group. The compounds are described as tumor inhibiting agents, and useful for treating dermatological conditions and rheumatic illnesses.United States Patent No. 4,723,028 discloses certain, (primarily alkyl substituted) 1,2-diphenyle- thene (stilbene) derivatives which have retinoic acid¬ like activity.United States Patent No. 4,740,519 discloses certain aromatic heterocycle derivatives which have retinoic acid like activity.Published European Patent Application 0 130795 discloses ethene derivatives, where the ethene moiety is substituted by a substituted phenyl group and by a substitituted chro an, thiochroman or guinoline group. The compounds are useful for inhibiting the degradation of cartilage in mammals. 

 European Patent Application 176034A (published April 2, 1986) discloses tetrahydronaphtalene compounds hav_ g an ethynylbenzoic group. United States Patent No. 4,739,098 discloses compounds wherein three olefinic units from the acid-containing moiety of retinoic acid are replaced by an ethynylphenyl functionality. These compound have retinoic acid-like biological activity.United States Patent No. 4,810,804 (issued on March 7, 1989) based on an application of the same inventor and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, discloses such disubstituted acetylene compounds wherein one of the substituents of the acetylene (ethyne) group is a substituted phenyl group, and the second substituent is a substituted or unsubstituted 6-chromanyl, 6-thiochromanyl or 6-tet- rahydroguinolinyl group. The compounds disclosed and claimed in United States Patent No. 4,810,804 have retinoic acid-like biological activity.Several co-pending applications and recently issued patents of the present inventor, which are assigned to the assignee of the present
