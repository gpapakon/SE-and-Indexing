<ABSTRACT>
A surface illuminating apparatus which may be 
lightweight, thin-walled and reduced in manufacturing 

expense with improved brightness thereof relative to 
that of a light source, and comprising a light source 

(1) formed of a long lamp and having a light-emitting 
portion (2) on one side thereof, an optically conductive 

case (6) extending in a light-emitting direction from 
said light-emitting portion (2), opened in an upper 

surface thereof, and provided with a diffusing 
reflective layer (6a) on a bottom surface thereof and an 

air layer (5) leading diffusedly reflected light towards 
said upper surface and a light diffusing plate (7) 

provided on the upper surface of said optically 
conductive case (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface 
illuminating apparatus, primarily for use as a back 
light of a liquid crystal display device. Surface illuminating apparatus, which has been 
conventionally used as back light of a liquid crystal 
display device, comprises: an optically conductive 
plate formed of transparent resins, such as acrylic 
resin, and provided with a diffusing reflective layer 
consisting of dot-shaped projections on one side 
thereof; a reflective and light diffusing plate mounted 
upon said optically conductive plate; and a light 
source arranged on an edge portion of the optically 
conductive plate. A light emitted from said light 
source is led to the optically conductive plate from its 
side surface to be diffusedly reflected by said 
diffusing reflective layer and said liquid crystal 
display device being illuminated through said light 
diffusing plate. However, recently liquid crystal display devices 
have been growing in size, but have been becoming 
lighter and thinner on the other hand, and thus it has 
been required that also said surface illuminating 
apparatus is reduced in weight, thickness, consumption 
of electric power and manufacturing expense.  However, the conventional surface illuminating 
apparatus comprises the optically conductive plate and 
the reflective plate and the light diffusing plate 
mounted upon the optically conductive plate, so that 
there is a limit to the weight and thickness reduction 
of the optically conductive plate due to its necessary 
thickness. In addition, also one, in which the optically 
conductive plate is devised in shape, as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 3-111819, 
has been required but the limitation in weight and 
thickness reduction cannot be avoided so far as the 
optically conductive plate is used. It is an object of the present invention to 
provides a surface illuminating apparatus which may be 
lightweight, thin-walled and reduced in manufacturing 
expense with improved brightness thereof relative to 
that of a light source. In order to achieve the above described object, a 
surface illuminating apparatus according to the present 
invention comprises: a light source formed of a long 
lamp and having a light-emitting portion on one side 
thereof; an optically conductive case extending in a 
light-emitting direction from said light-emitting 
portion, opened in an upper surface thereof, and 
provided with a diffusing reflective layer on a bottom  
 
surface thereof and an air layer for leading
