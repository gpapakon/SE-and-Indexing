<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a test module employing a microprocessor (13) capable of managing tests to be carried out periodically on the self-contained emergency lighting unit with which it is associated. According to the invention, this microprocessor (13) being coupled to a time base (18) specific to the self-contained emergency lighting unit in question and including cyclic counting means (16) capable of delivering a counter measurement on expiry of the time constant of the time base (18), arrangements are taken, by design, so that the result of this counting measurement is random. Application to testing self-contained emergency lighting units.

A checking module for an autonomous emergency lighting unit of the
type using a microprocessor (13) for conducting tests to be periodically

effected on the autonomous emergency lighting unit, characterised in that,
the microprocessor (13) being coupled to a time base (18) specific to the

autonomous emergency lighting unit in question and comprising cyclic
counting means (16) for delivering a counting measurement at the expiry of

the time constant of said time base (18), arrangements are made by virtue
of design for the result of said counting measurement to be random.
A checking module according to claim 1 characterised in that the
time constant of the time base (18) is more than two hundred times greater

than the duration of a cycle of the cyclic counting means (16).
A checking module according to claim 2 characterised in that the
time constant of the time base (18) is at least five hundred times greater

than the duration of a cycle of the cyclic counting means (16).
A checking module according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that, before delivering a counting measurement, the

cyclic counting means (16) are restarted at least once.
A checking module according to any one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the time base comprises an RC circuit.
A checking module according to claim 5 characterised in that the
capacitor (21) that the time base (18) comprises comes from a production

involving a relatively wide degree of dispersion.
A checking module according to claim 6 characterised in that the
capacitor (21) that the time base (18) comprises comes from a production

involving a degree of dispersion ranging at least from -5% to +5%. 
A checking module according to claim 7 characterised in that the
capacitor that the time base (18) comprises comes from a production

involving a degree of dispersion ranging from -20% to +80%.
A checking module according to any one of claims 5 to 7
characterised in that the resistor (20) that the time base (18) comprises

comes from a production involving a relatively wide degree of dispersion.
A checking module according to any one of claims 5 to 9
characterised in that the capacitor (21) that the time base (18) comprises

has a relatively poor temperature characteristic.
A checking module according to any one of claims 1 to 10
characterised in that the time base (18) is connected to an input-output

port (14) of the microprocessor (13).
