<ABSTRACT>
A modified polyolefin prepared from an aqueous 
suspension containing (a) a crystalline polyolefin, (b) 1 

to 500 parts by weight of a vinyl monomer per 100 parts by 
weight of the crystalline polyolefin, and (c) 0.01 to 10 

parts by weight of a radical polymerization initiator per 
100 parts by weight of the vinyl monomer by impregnating 

the crystalline polyolefin (a) with the vinyl monomer (b) 
and heating the aqueous suspension to polymerize the vinyl 

monomer (b) at a temperature equal to or higher than a 
temperature at which the crystal region of the polyolefin 

(a) begins to substantially melt, which has an excellent 
effect of improving processability of other polyolefins 

and provides a polyolefin composition having excellent 
properties such as processability, impact resistance, 

rigidity and surface properties when the modified 
polyolefin is incorporated into polyolefins optionally

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modified
polyolefin resin, and more particularly to a modified
polyolefin resin which comprises a crystalline polyolefin,
and a vinyl polymer prepared by a polymerization in the
presence of the crystalline polyolefin in a specific
manner so as to be dispersed in the fine particle form in
the crystalline polyolefin as a matrix and to be at least
partially grafted to the polyolefin, and which can improve
the melting property of various other polyolefins, thus
having an excellent effect of improving processability of
other polyolefins. The present invention also relates to
a polyolefin composition containing a polyolefin and the
modified polyolefin resin, and more particularly to a
polyolefin composition having excellent properties such as
processability, impact resistance, rigidity and surface
properties and being suitably applicable to the production
of various molded articles.Polyolefins have been widely utilized in various
molded articles, since they are inexpensive and are
superior in physical properties. However, they have
problems.For example, polypropylene has drawbacks that it
is poor in processability such as thermoformability of the
sheet (hereinafter referred to as "thermoformability),
calendering, blow moldability and expansion moldability
since the melt viscosity and the melt tension are small,
and that it is poor in rigidity as compared with
polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, ABS resin and the like,
and that it is also poor in low temperature impact
resistance, surface properties such as gloss and hardness,
and coatability.In order to improve the processability of
polypropylene, polyethylene has been generally
incorporated into polypropylene by mechanical mixing. 
However, since the processability improving effect of
polyethylene is insufficient, a large amount of
polyethylene is required for this purpose, thus resulting
in lowering of rigidity.It is attempted to raise the melt viscosity and
melt tension of polyolefins by increasing the molecular
weight. However, use of polyolefins having a high
molecular weight encounters a serious problem that they
are difficult to be processed by extrusion which is one of
important processing methods therefor.It is proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4,156,703
to improve the processability of polyethylene by adding a
non-crosslinked acrylic polymer thereto. However, since
compatibility between them is not sufficient and since the
acrylic polymer added is non-crosslinked, the acrylic
polymer separates from polyethylene when
