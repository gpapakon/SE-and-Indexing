<ABSTRACT>
A process for recycling an asphaltic surface. The process comprises: (a) providing an asphaltic surface having an upper surface for recycling; (b) rupturing the upper surface to a depth of at least about 1.5 inches to provide a ruptured upper surface; (c) heating and mixing the ruptured upper surface on the asphalt surface to a temperature in the range of from about 100 DEG  to about 350 DEG  F to produce a heated, ruptured upper surface which is substantially free of moisture; and (d) pressing the heated, ruptured upper surface to provide a recycled pavement surface. An apparatus adapted for carrying out the process is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for recycling an
asphalt surface and to apparatus therefor.As used herein, the term asphalt also comprises macadam and
tarmac. Asphalt paved road surfaces typically comprise a mixture of asphalt
cement (typically a black, sticky, petrochemical binder) and an aggregate
comprising appropriately sized stones and/or gravel. The asphalt concrete
mixture is usually laid, compressed and smoothed to provide an asphalt paved
road surface.Over time, an asphalt paved road surface can deteriorate as a
result of a number of factors. For example, seasonal temperature fluctuations
can cause the road surface to become brittle and/or cracked. Erosion or
compaction of the road bed beneath the road surface may also result in
cracking. Moreover, certain of the chemical constituents incorporated in fresh
asphalt are gradually lost over time or their properties changed with time,
further contributing to brittleness and/or cracking of the road surface. Where
concentrated cracking occurs, pieces of pavement may become dislodged.
This dislodgement can create traffic hazards, and accelerates the deterioration
of adjacent pavement and highway substructure. Even if cracking and the loss
of pavement pieces do not occur, the passage of traffic can polish the upper
highway surface, and such a surface can be slippery and dangerous. In
addition, traffic-caused wear can groove, trough, rut and crack a highway
surface. Under wet highway conditions, water can collect in these
imperfections and set up dangerous vehicle hydro-planing phenomena.
Collected water also contributes to the further deterioration of the pavement.Prior to about the 1970's, available methods for repairing old
asphalt-paved road surfaces included: spot treatments such as patching or
sealing, paving with new materials over top of the original surface, and 
removal of some of the original surface and replacement with new materials.
Each of these methods had inherent drawbacks and limitations.Since about the early 1970's, with increasing raw material, oil
and energy costs, there has been a growing interest in trying to recycle the
original asphalt. The world's highways have come to be recognized as a very
significant renewable resource.Early recycling techniques involved removing some of the
original surface and transporting it to a centralized, stationary recycling plant
where it would be mixed with new asphalt and/or rejuvenating chemicals.
The rejuvenated paving material would then be trucked back to the work site
and laid.

A process for recycling an asphalt surface comprising the steps of:

(a) rupturing the upper surface of said asphalt surface to a desired depth, the ruptured
surface overlying the remaining unruptured portion of said asphalt surface;
(b) applying heat to said ruptured surface;
(c) mixing at least some of the ruptured surface on the unruptured asphalt surface;
(d) repeating steps (b) and (c) until said ruptured surface is at a temperature suitable
for pressing; and
(e) pressing said ruptured surface to form a recycled asphalt surface;

   characterized in that no rupturing of the asphalt surface occurs during Steps (b) and (c).
The process defined in claim 1, wherein the temperature is in the range of from 38° to
177°C.
The process defined in any one of claims 1-2, wherein prior to Step (e), the ruptured
surface is fed to and further mixed in a supplementary mixer and thereafter applied to the

unruptured asphalt surface.

disposed above the asphaltic surface and between adjacent elongate heaters, (30) the mixing element (40)

comprising a blade member capable of being at least partially immersed in the substrate.
The machine defined in claim 9, wherein the mixing element comprises a plurality of
spaced, staggered mixing blades, each mixing blade having a width less than the width of the

ruptured asphaltic surface.
