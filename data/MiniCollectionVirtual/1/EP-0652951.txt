<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to DNA
segments encoding proteins of the transforming growth factor
beta superfamily. In particular, the present invention
relates to a mammalian GDF-1 protein and to a DNA segment
encoding GDF-1, and unique fragments thereof. The invention
further relates to a mammalian UOG-1 protein and to a DNA
segment encoding same and fragments thereof.A growing number of polypeptide factors playing critical
roles in regulating differentiation processes during
embryogenesis have been found to be structurally homologous
to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Among these are
Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) [Cate et al, Cell 45:685-698
(1986)], which causes regression of the Mullerian duct
during male sex differentiation; the bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMP's) [Wozney et al, Science 242:1528-1534 (1988)],
which can induce de novo cartilage and bone formation; the
inhibins and activins [Mason et al, Nature 318:659-663 (1985);
Forage et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 83:3091-3095 (1986);
Eto et al, Biochem Biophys Res Comm 142:1095-1103 (1987); and
Murata et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2434-2438 (1988)],
which regulate secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone by
pituitary cells and which, in the case of the activins, can
affect erythroid differentiation; the Drosophila
decapentaplegic (DPP) gene product [Padgett et al, Nature
325:81-84 (1987)], which influences dorsal-ventral
specification as well as morphogenesis of the imaginal disks;
the Xenopus Vg-1 gene product [Weeks et al, Cell 51:861-867
(1987)], which localizes to the vegetal pole of eggs; and Vgr-1
[Lyons et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 86:4554-4558
(1989)], a gene identified on the basis of its homology to Vg-1
and shown to be expressed during mouse embryogenesis. In
addition, one of the most potent mesoderm-inducing factors,
XTC-MIF, also appears to be structurally related to TGF-β
[Rosa et al, Science 239:783-785 (1988); and Smith et al, 
Development 103:591-600 (1988)]. The TGF-β's themselves are
capable of influencing a wide variety of differentiation
processes, including adipogenesis, myogenesis, chondrogenesis,
hematopoiesis, and epithelial cell differentiation [Massague,
J., Cell 49:437-438 (1987)], and at least one TGF-β, namely
TGF-β2, is capable of inducing mesoderm formation in frog
embryos [Rosa et al, Science 239:783-785 (1988)].The present invention relates to new members of the TGF-β
superfamily, and to the nucleotide sequence encoding same.
These new gene sequences and the encoded
