A process for the production of oil-in-water emulsions 
of polar oil components (A), characterized in that 


(A) 10 to 90% by weight of a polar oil component 
are emulsified with 
(B) 0.5 to 30% by weight of a nonionic emulsifier having 
an HLB value of 10 to 18 and 
(C) 0 to 30% by weight of a co-emulsifier from the group 
of fatty alcohols containing 12 to 22 carbon atoms 

or partial esters of polyols containing 3 to 6 
carbon atoms with fatty acids containing 12 to 22 

carbon atoms and 
(D) 0.01 to 50% by weight of an interfacial moderator 
selected from the group of tocopherols, Guerbet 

alcohols containing 16 to 20 carbon atoms or a 
steroid containing 1 to 3 OH groups 
 
in the presence of 8 to 85% by weight of water at a 

temperature above the melting point of the mixture of 
components (A) to (D) and the emulsion is heated to a 

temperature within or above the phase inversion temperature 
range - or the emulsion is prepared at that temperature 

- and is then cooled to a temperature below the 
phase inversion temperature range and optionally further 

diluted with water. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the interfacial moderator (D) is used in a quantity 

corresponding to 0.1 to 30% by weight. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the interfacial moderator (D) is used in a 

quantity corresponding to between 0.5 and 15% by weight. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that Î±-tocopherol is used as the interfacial 

moderator (D).  
 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that 2-octyl dodecanol is used as the 

interfacial moderator (D). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a polar oil component (A) with a 

dipole moment above 1.96 D is used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a polar oil component (A) with a 

dipole moment of 2.0 to 3.6 D is used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the ratio by weight of the oil 

component (A) to the interfacial moderator (D) is in the 
range from 1:0.1 to 1:1.
