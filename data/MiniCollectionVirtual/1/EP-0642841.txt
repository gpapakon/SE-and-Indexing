<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a fluid applicator system (26), 
which can be used to apply or remove fluids from the press 

belts (19) associated with a continuous belt press. The present 
invention provides for applying a uniformly thick layer of 

fluid to a press belt with one or more rollers (111,115), and the use of 
those or other rollers to remove liquid from a press belt. 

The applicator system of the present invention can be self-cleaning, 
and the rollers temperature regulated to facilitate 

the application and removal of liquids. The present invention 
also provides a ventilation system for removing any dangerous 

vapors.

<DESCRIPTION>
Belt-type presses for making particleboard, fiberboard, 
copper clad boards for printed circuit boards and the like are 
known in the prior art related to the invention. The 
materials being pressed (known as press materials or press 
products) can include laminates, rubber products, 
particleboard, plastics and any other products formed by 
pressing multiple layers together. Generally, belt presses 
comprise an endless upper press belt, often a steel press 
belt, circulated over spaced-apart guide belt rollers, and a 
corresponding endless lower press belt, also often a steel 
press belt, circulated over spaced-apart guide belt rollers as 
well. Between them, these press belts form a pressing gap or 
pressing region of the belt-type press, between the press 
framework having upper and lower platens. The upper and lower 
belts each have their own drive mechanisms. In a known press 
of this type, two chains are associated with each of the press 
platens and press belts, or a total of four chains per belt 
press system. The upper and lower platens form an entrance 
region along a complete horizontal plane. Into the pressing region between the platens and their 
corresponding press belts, the spaced apart rollers are fed 
and guided along a circulation path with the aid of upper and 
lower roller circulation mechanisms. The roller circulation 
mechanisms comprise upper and lower chain sets, where each set  
 
is driven by a chain drive sprocket. The chain sets, in turn, 
circulate or drive the rollers so that the rollers move along 
with the press belts, situated between their respective belts 
and the platens. Guide rails are used to channel the movement 
of the chain sets and rollers in the intended direction. 
Thus, the upper press mechanism has two chains with rollers 
disposed across the width of the press between both chains, 
and the lower press mechanism has two corresponding chains 
with rollers disposed between them as well. In many cases, the upper and lower platens are heated. 
The rollers are situated between the steel press belts and the 
heated platens. The rollers are equally spaced apart and roll 
more or less along with the belt. As press material is 
inserted into the entrance of the pressing region (or press 
gap entrance), the steel press belts are contacted by the 
press products on one side and the rollers on the other. In 
turn, the rollers contact the press belts and the heated 
platens, thus acting to transfer heat from the platens to the 
steel belts. The heat is ultimately
