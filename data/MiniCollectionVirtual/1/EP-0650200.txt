<ABSTRACT>
An electro-luminescent material and solid state electro-luminescent 
device comprising a mixed material layer (3) 

formed of a mixture of silicon and silicon oxide doped 
with rare earth ions so as to show intense room-temperature 

photo- and electro-luminescence. The luminescence 
is due to internal transitions of the rare earth ions. 

The mixed material layer has an oxygen content ranging 
from 1 to 65 atomic % and is produced by vapor deposition 

and rare earth ions implant. A separated implant 
with elements of the V or III column of the periodic 

table of elements gives rise to a PN junction (3,4). The 
so obtained structure is then subjected to thermal 

treatment in the range 400-1100°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a solid state electro-luminescent
device and to the process for fabrication thereof.As known, the use of silicon for manufacturing
opto-electronic devices is limited since the indirect
band gap of silicon does not allow efficient photon
emission. The doping of silicon with erbium ions can
result in intense luminescence only at low temperatures,
near the liquid nitrogen boiling point (77°K). Moreover,
it is known that the doping of silicon dioxide with erbium
allows room temperature photo-luminescence. However,
with erbium-doped silicon dioxide, it is not possible
to observe luminescence produced by carrier transport
(electro-luminescence) because of the insulating
nature of silicon oxide.Finally, a detailed analysis of the luminescence
effects in erbium doped single crystal silicon indicates
that opto-electronic application of this material is severely
limited by the small solid solubility of erbium
in silicon grown either by Czochralski or by float zone
techniques.Nowadays, photon emitting devices are usually 
fabricated using compound semiconductors, such as GaAs
or similar. However, technological processing of these
materials is severely limited by the outdiffusion of one
of the constituents, which determines the loss of stoichiometry
for thermal processes at intermediate temperatures.
These materials, moreover, are not well suited
for typical planar technology processes which are
based on the properties of silicon dioxide. Diffusion
barriers, insulating layers and all the other functions
of silicon dioxide are replaced by deposited layers,
characterized by physical-chemical performances which
are worse than those of thermal silicon oxide.Furthermore, the cost of compound semiconductor
substrates is much higher than the cost of silicon wafers
and the present production is unable to supply wafers
whose size reaches the diameter of silicon wafers,
currently of 200 mm. Such a limitation implies a smaller
number of devices being fabricated in a single set of
processes and thus still higher costs for each device.A composite material having photo-luminescent properties
is disclosed in the article "Room-temperature luminescent
from Er-implanted semi-insulating polycrystalline silicon"
S. Lombardo et al, Applied Physics Letters, vol. 63, no.
14 (4.10.93). According to this article, an SIPOS film
doped with erbium shows luminescence when illuminated with
a laser pump. The potentiality of the use of such a
material for electrically activated light emission is
mentioned.The aim
