<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of identification of the base in a target position in a DNA sequence wherein sample DNA is subjected to amplification; the amplified DNA is immobilised and then subjected to strand separation, the non-immobilised strand being removed and an extension primer, which hybridises to the immobilised DNA immediately adjacent to the target position, is provided; each of four aliquots of the immobilised single stranded DNA is then subjected to a polymerase reaction in the presence of a dideoxynucleotide, each aliquot using a different dideoxynucleotide whereby only the dideoxynucleotide complementary to the base in the target position becomes incorpored; the four aliquots are then subjected to extension in the presence of all four deoxynucleotides, whereby in each aliquot the DNA which has not reacted with the dideoxynucleotide is extended to form double stranded DNA while the dideoxy-blocked DNA remains as non-extended DNA; followed by identification of the double stranded and/or non-extended DNA to indicate which dideoxynucleotide was incorporated and hence which base was present in the target position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method for identifying
a base in a target position in a DNA sequence.In the diagnostic or forensic use of DNA analysis,
full sequencing of target DNA may be unnecessary
where the detection of a single base variation or mismatch
is sufficient to provide the required information.
Such a single base variation or mismatch may for example
arise from a point mutation or, in fact, any deletion
or insertion of genetic material where the detection of
the first irregular base in the sequence will give the required
diagnostic information. Thus, Allelic Specific
PCR has been developed whereby PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) is carried out on a sample using a pair
of primers for the target DNA one of which is relatively
short and will hybridise to one allelic locus of the DNA
but not to the other allelic sequence. Failure to amplify
is thus indicative that the non-hybridising allele of the
DNA was present but unfortunately the conditions required
to obtain reliable hybridisation to the normal DNA
are difficult to achieve in practice.It has been proposed to carry out PCR using probes
hybridising to positions away from the target mutation
or area of allelic variation, followed by use of a labelled
probe which will not hybridise to the mutated region or
area of allelic variation. However, this also commonly
gives false negatives.A method of detecting allele-specific DNA called the
Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) has recently been developed
and has been reviewed by F. Barang (PCR Methods
and Applications Vol.1, 5-16). Two different oligonucleotides,
which hybridise adjacent to each other on
complementary DNA, are required and the products of
LCR need to be separated on a polyacrylamide gel before
a result can be determined.Full length sequencing, particularly solid phase sequencing,
as described in WO 89/09282 gives accurate
results but is more demanding and may thus not be appropriate
for diagnostic screening in some instances.The present invention is based on the concept of
using a polymerase reaction on four aliquots of amplified
and immobilised DNA of interest in single stranded form.
Each aliquot uses the same specific extension primer
and a different dideoxynucleotide but no deoxynucleotides
so that only the dideoxynucleotide complementary
to the base in the target position is incorporated;
the target position being directly adjacent to the 3' end
of the specific extension primer hybridising to the DNA.
Put another way, the target position on the immobilised
strand is immediately 5'

<CLAIMS>
A method of identification of the base in a target
position in a DNA sequence wherein sample DNA is

subjected to amplification; the amplified DNA is
immobilised and then subjected to strand separation, the

non-immobilised strand being removed and an extension
primer, which hybridises to the immobilised DNA

immediately adjacent to the target position, is
provided; each of four aliquots of the immobilised

single stranded DNA is then subjected to a polymerase
reaction in the presence of a dideoxynucleotide, each

aliquot using a different dideoxynucleotide whereby only
the dideoxynucleotide complementary to the base in the

target position becomes incorporated; the four aliquots
are then subjected to extension in the presence of all

four deoxynucleotides, whereby in each aliquot the DNA
which has not reacted with the dideoxynucleotide is

extended to form double stranded DNA while the dideoxy-blocked
DNA remains as non-extended DNA; followed by

identification of the double stranded and/or non-extended
DNA to indicate which dideoxynucleotide was

incorporated and hence which base was present in the
target position.
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the sample
DNA is amplified by 
in vitro
 amplification reaction
using a first primer which is immobilised or is provided

with means for immobilisation.
A method as claimed in claim 2 in which said first

primer includes a region which, in double stranded form,
contains a recognition site for a DNA binding protein

carrying a label and formation of double stranded DNA by
chain extension is identified by binding to said 

labelled protein.
A method as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 in which
the said first primer carries biotin as means for

immobilisation.
A method as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4 in
which the 
in vitro
 amplification uses a second primer
hybridising to a region A at the 3' terminus of the

target DNA and/or to a region B extending 3' from region
A, said second primer having a 3' terminal sequence

which hybridises to at least a portion of regions A
and/or B of the target sequence while having at its 5'-end

a sequence substantially identical to A, said
amplification producing double-stranded target DNA

having at the 3'-end of the target sequence, in the
following order, the region A, a region capable of

forming a loop and a sequence A' complementary to
sequence A, whereafter the amplified double-stranded DNA

is subjected in immobilised form to strand separation
whereby the non-immobilised target strand is liberated

and region A' is permitted or caused to hybridise to
region A, thereby forming said loop.
A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims
in which identification of the formation of double

stranded DNA is effected by detection or estimation of
pyrophosphate liberated in the chain extension reaction.
A method as claimed in claim 6 in which
pyrophosphate is detected or estimated by the

luciferase/luciferin reaction wherein emission of light
is an indicator or measure of pyrophosphate.
