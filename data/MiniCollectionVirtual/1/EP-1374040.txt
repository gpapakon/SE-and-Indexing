<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided for providing a seamless link between a mobile terminal and application software stored on a server. An icon corresponding to the application software is displayed on a display of the mobile terminal. In response to a user selecting the icon, the mobile terminal downloads the application software from the server and automatically runs the application software. The mobile terminal may also be configured to remove one more applications from the mobile terminal to free up enough memory for the application software.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DOWNLOADING APPLICATION SOFTWARE TO A MOBILE TERMINALBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the management of software installed on a mobile terminal. More particularly, the invention provides a method and system for storing software on a server and transmitting the software to a mobile terminal when the software is needed by the mobile terminal.Description Of Related ArtConsumers are increasingly using mobile terminals, such as cellular telephones and handheld computing devices. In addition to the traditional function of transmitting telephone calls, mobile terminals have been used for additional functions, such as accessing the Internet, storing scheduling information, storing telephone numbers and running a variety of software applications. Mobile terminals are integrating more and more capability typically associated with conventional computing devices. As a result of technical developments, the mobile terminal processing circuitry is generally capable of running, i.e., executing, content, also referred to as an application program.Content, executable or otherwise usable by the processing circuitry, is typically stored at a memory device which is accessible by the processing circuitry.Content can be downloaded to a mobile terminal from the WWW, sometimes directly, and sometimes indirectly. If the mobile terminal has the capability to connect directly to the WWW, the application can be downloaded directly. In contrast, if an 

intermediate device such as a PC is used, the content is said to be downloaded to a mobile terminal indirectly. Downloading content to a Nokia 9000 Series â„¢ is possible, for example, by way of a cable or infrared connection from a source such as a personal computer. Increased amounts of, and types of, content shall likely become available for downloading to a mobile terminal in the future.Because of the limited memory capacity of mobile terminals, when installing a new application, a user or the mobile terminal itself may have to eliminate an old application in memory to make room for a new application in memory. When the maximum capacity of the memory is reached on a mobile terminal, the operating system cannot normally provide memory management of the problem without user intervention. When downloading a new application, if the problem of memory limitation occurs, the user is typically prompted to free, in a manual way, memory before continuing. Alternatively, the user is required to add memory modules to the mobile

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for downloading an application chosen by a user to a mobile terminal from an application storage, the method comprising the steps of:
if the size of a memory currently available at the mobile terminal is not sufficient to store the chosen application, selecting one or more applications which occupy such memory at the mobile terminal having a size which, when aggregated with the size of the memory currently available, is sufficient to store the chosen
application; deleting the selected one or more applications from the mobile terminal
memory; receiving the chosen application from the application storage; and storing the received application into the aggregate of the memory currently
available at the mobile terminal and the memory occupied by the selected one or
more applications.
2. The method according to claim 1 , further comprising the steps of:
if the size of the memory currently available at the mobile terminal is
sufficient to store the chosen application, receiving the chosen application from
the application storage; and
storing the application received into the memory currently available at the
mobile terminal. 

3. The method according to claim 2, wherein all the steps, other than
the step of receiving a request from the user, occur automatically, without
intervention by the user.
4. The method according to claim 3, further comprising the step of
determining a movability metric for each application currently stored in the mobile
terminal; and wherein each of the selected applications has a movability metric larger
than the movability metric of any of the applications not selected.
5. The method according to claim 2, further comprising the step of
determining a movability metric for each application currently stored in the mobile
terminal; and wherein each of the selected applications has a movability metric larger
than the movability metric of any of the applications not selected.
6. A method of providing a seamless link between a mobile station and a software application stored in a server, the method comprising the steps of:
(1) providing an icon representing a software application on a display of
the mobile terminal;
(2) storing the software application in the server; and 


 (3) in response to a user selecting the icon, transmitting the software application from the server to the mobile station and automatically running the software application.
7. The method of claim 6, further including the steps of:
determining the size of the software application; and
deleting one or more software applications previously stored in the mobile terminal.
8. A computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions for performing the steps of:
(1) providing an icon representing a software application on the display of the mobile terminal;
(2) in response to a user selecting the icon, causing the mobile station to
automatically retrieve the software application from a server; and
(3) deleting one or more software applications previously stored in the
mobile terminal;
(4) running the retrieved software application.
9. A system having a mobile terminal in communication with a server,
the system comprising: 


 a mobile terminal display that includes an icon representing a software
application;
a server memory that stores the software application;
a mobile terminal processor that includes computer executable instructions
for performing the steps of:
(1) in response to a user selecting the icon, causing the mobile
terminal to retrieve the software application from the server; and
(2) running the software application.
10. A mobile terminal comprising:
a graphical user interface that includes an icon representing a first software application;
a memory that stores a second software application; and
a mobile terminal processor that includes computer executable instructions
for performing the steps of:
(1) in response to a user selecting the icon, deleting the second software
application and causing the mobile terminal to retrieve the first software
application from a server; and
(2) running the first software application.
