<ABSTRACT>
The lamp employs a fluorescent tube (9) which is protected by a partly transparent cover (19). The fluorescent tube is supported by a two part box (5,7) which has ventilating holes (8) and also contains an electronic device of tube ignition (6). The lamp is designed to fit directly into wall sockets and has a pins and plug (1,2) connected to the fluorescent tube (9) through a microswitch (12) and an articulated arm (4). This allows the orientation of the lamp and the linked switching to be adjusted to the needs of the individual location.
