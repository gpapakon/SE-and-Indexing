<ABSTRACT>
A surgical suturing needle is formed to have a needle 
shaft (12) with a rectangular cross-section and a needle 

head (14) with a triangular needle point (18). A transitional 
portion (21) between the needle shaft (12) and the needle head (14) is 

formed to have a maximum width (W1) greater than the width (W2) 
of the needle shaft (12). A plurality of cutting edges (24) 

extend from the needle point (18) to at least the maximum 
width section of the transitional portion (21). After 

forming and grinding the suturing needle, it is 
immersed in an acid bath and exposed to an electrical 

field. Finally, the surgical needle is heat-treated to 
increase its strength and resistance to bending or 

breaking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a design and method of
manufacturing a surgical suturing needle that can be
used generally for adjoining or closing adjacent
portions of skin or tissue. More particularly, the
suturing needle design and manufacturing process of the
present invention are directed to a new class of
suturing needle particularly suitable in plastic and
reconstructive suturing applications.Suturing needles for applying sutures, or stitches, by
hand in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues are well
known in the art. The sutures are typically used to
close wounds or adjoin adjacent tissue, often at the
conclusion of a surgical procedure. Conventional
suturing needles are usually made from a cut blank of
material such as stainless steel. The cut blank is
metal-worked using well known machining techniques to
form a surgical suturing needle. The needle generally
includes a shaft, a rear end portion with means to grip
or secure a suturing thread and a needle head at a
front end portion for puncturing skin and tissue
through which the needle travels. The needle head
typically includes a sharpened needle tip at its distal
end and cutting edges.Needle sharpness is an important consideration in
designing and manufacturing surgical suturing needles. Sharper needles require less force to penetrate the
tissue and thus cause less tissue trauma. In addition,
sharper needles reduce fatigue on the needle itself,
making it less likely to bend or break during suturing.
Needle sharpness is typically defined in terms of a so-called
penetration force -- the force necessary for a
needle point to puncture, or penetrate, the tissue.
The penetration force is primarily determined by the
design and sharpness of the needle point. However,
needle sharpness is also affected by a drag force of
the needle as it travels through the tissue. The
ability of the needle to pass smoothly through the
tissue is a desirable characteristic. The drag force
of the needle depends upon the design and sharpness of
the needle, especially the needle head. The quality of
a lubricating coating on the needle also affects the
drag force. For example, if the lubricating coating on
the needle wears off, the drag force on the needle
increases with each pass of the needle through the
tissue. This effect could give the surgeon-user the
false impression that the needle is failing to retain
its sharpness.Another important consideration in designing and
manufacturing surgical suturing needles is their
resistance to bending or breaking during use. The
