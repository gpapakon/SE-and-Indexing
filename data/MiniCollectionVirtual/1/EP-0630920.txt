<CLAIMS>
A polymer powder whose polymer, in polymerized 
form, is composed of 


from 60 to 85% by weight of methyl methacrylate 
(monomer a), 
from 15 to 25% by weight of at least one a,β-mono-ethylenically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid of 3 to 6 

carbon atoms (monomer b) and 
from 0 to 15% by weight of other copolymerizable monomers 
(monomer c), 
with the proviso that 
the composition of the monomers a, b and c is chosen so 
that, according to the Fox relationship for a polymer 

composed of these monomers, a glass transition temperature 
of from 70 to 150°C results and 
the K value of the polymer, determined for the fully 
acidic form of the polymer in dimethylformamide at 23°C 

and at a polymer content of 0.1% by weight, is from 45 to 
100. 
A polymer powder as claimed in claim 1, the 
polymer of which contains monomers b and/or c having 

acidic functions, in neutralized form. 
A process for the preparation of a polymer powder 
as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the monomers constituting 

the polymer are polymerized by the free radical 
aqueous emulsion polymerization method and the resulting 

aqueous polymer dispersion is dried. 
A mineral building material having binding 
properties and based on a cement-containing mineral 

binder, containing a polymer powder as claimed in claim 
1 or 2.  

 
Use of a polymer powder as claimed in claim 1 or 
2 as an additive for mineral building materials having 

binding properties and based on cement-containing mineral 
binders. 
Use of an aqueous polymer dispersion containing 
a polymer composed of 


from 60 to 85% by weight of methyl methacrylate 
(monomer a), 
from 15 to 25% by weight of at least one α,β-mono-ethylenically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid of 3 to 6 

carbon atoms (monomer b) and 
from 0 to 15% by weight of other copolymerizable monomers 
(monomer c), 
with the proviso that 
the composition of the monomers a, b and c is chosen so 
that, according to the Fox relationship for a polymer 

composed of these monomers, a glass transition temperature 
of from 70 to 150°C results and 
the K value of the polymer, determined for the fully 
acidic form of the polymer in dimethylformamide at 23°C 

and at a polymer content of 0.1% by weight, is from 45 to 
100, 
as an additive for mineral building materials having 
binding properties and based on cement-containing mineral 

binders.
