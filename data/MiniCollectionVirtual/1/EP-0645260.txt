<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a support for a planographic 
printing plate which comprises roughening a surface of an 

aluminum plate (9) electrochemically, etching the surface by 
0.01 to 20 g/m² with alkali, and roughening the surface 

electrochemically in an electrolytic solution (5) containing 
hydrochloric acid or nitric acid as the principal component 

is disclosed. The support thus produced has base pits 
having a diameter of 1 to 30 µm and fine pits having a 

diameter of 0.05 to 0.5 µm formed on the base pits, and is 
improved in printing durability without increasing the 

scumming and fill-in characteristics of planographic 
printing plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing a
support for a planographic printing plate, particularly
comprising an aluminum plate, of which the surface is
roughened, suitable for offset printing plate.In general, aluminum plates are widely used as supports
for a lithographic printing plate. The surface of the
aluminum plate is usually roughened for the purpose of the
improvement in adhesiveness of a photosensitive layer
provided thereon and the improvement in the water retention
of nonimage area (the area which receives damping water
used during printing and repels oily ink, and is carried by
the area wherein the surface of the support is exposed) of
the lithographic printing plate produced using the same.The roughening is called graining, and there are
mechanical methods, such as ball graining, wire graining
and blush graining, chemical methods and electrochemical
methods.Heretofore, aluminum plate was treated with a
combination of a mechanical roughening method and an
electrochemical method to form a roughened surface suitable
as a support for a planographic printing plate, as disclosed
in Japanese Patent KOKAI Nos. 54-63902, 63-104890, 3-132395, 
etc.However, in the printing plate using the support for a
planographic printing plate formed by the above conventional
roughening method, scumming reduction (the ability of not
adhering ink onto nonimage area) and fill-in reduction
(the ability of nonimage area for retaining water) cannot
co-exist, and either characteristic was sacrificed, usually
the fill-in reduction is insufficient.Moreover, printing durability (the ability of not
separating a photosensitive layer from a support upon
printing) is also insufficient.US-A-4,721,552 teaches a method for producing lithographic printing plates.
According to this prior art document, a second electrochemical roughening is carried out in
0.5-10%, preferable 1-2% of nitric acid. The electric current used is AC. It is known from
GB-A-2 118 575 to use AC for the second roughening and an acid concentration of 0.1-4wt.%
for producing a support for lithographic printing plates. A method for producing an
aluminum support for a planographic printing plate is known from EP-A-268 058.An object of the invention is to provide a method of
producing a support for a planographic printing plate which
has resolved the above problems and which can produce the
support excellent in reduced scumming and reduced fill-in
and also excellent in printing durability.The inventors have investigated in order to achieve the
above object,
