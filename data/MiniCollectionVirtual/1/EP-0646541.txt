<ABSTRACT>
A tank for a pump is disclosed, which can accommodate a 
fluid for pumping, such as a chemical liquid. To a lower 

portion (1b) of a tank body (1) which has a pump accommodation 
recess (4) formed on one side, a weight member (2) is removably 

secured. Prior to the securing, at the tank installation site 
the inner space (6) of the weight member is filled with a 

weight material, such as water or sand, through an opening (20) 
formed in the upper portion (2a) of the weight member. By so 

doing, when the residual quantity of the fluid for pumping in 
the tank body of the tank after the installation is reduced to 

be small, the tank is held in stable state by the weight of the 
weight member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tank for a pump, which 
accommodates a fluid for pumping, such as a chemical, and used 
with a small size pump. This type of tank is used with a pump in a system for 
quantitatively pumping a fluid such as a chemical. In the site 
of installation of the tank, the pump is installed on the tank 
top, for instance, for saving the installation space. Further, 
the tank is secured in position by an anchor bolt in the 
installation site. As this type of tank, a synthetic resin molding is used, 
which is comparatively light in weight. Therefore, when the 
residual quantity of fluid for pumping in the tank becomes 
small, the balance of the tank is deteriorated, and the tank 
may be displaced or turned down when it is touched from the 
outside or by strong winds in case where it is installed 
outdoors. Particularly, where the pump is installed on top of 
the tank as in the prior art use, the centroid of the tank is 
at a high position, and the possibility of the displacement or 
turning-down of the tank is increased. Where the fluid for 
pumping in the tank is a chemical or a chemical compound, the 
turning-down of the tank may bring about a grave accident. The installation of the tank, therefore, requires an 
operation of securing the tank with anchor bolts or the like. 
When the tank is installed on a roof or an existing equipment,  
 
it is necessary to newly mount anchor bolts or the like, thus 
leading to cost increase. Actually, in many cases the tank is 
left without being secured. Further, when the tank is 
installed on the ground surface, it can not be sufficiently 
secured with anchor bolts. An object of the invention is to provide a tank for a pump, 
which can be installed in a stabler state, can be positively 
prevented from its occasional displacement or turning-down and 
can be readily installed. To attain the above object, according to the invention 
there is provided a tank for a pump, which comprises a tank 
body having a pump accommodation recess formed on one side and 
accommodating a pump, the tank body accommodating a fluid for 
pumping, a weight member provided under the tank body, and a 
mounting means for removably securing an upper portion of the 
weight member and a lower portion of the tank body. According to the invention, there is also provided a tank 
for a pump, in which the weight member has an inner space 
capable of being filled with a weight material such as water or 
sand and an opening formed in the top of it and communicating 
with the inner
