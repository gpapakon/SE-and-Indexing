<ABSTRACT>
Fungicidal mixture containing in a synergistically active quantity: a) a carbamate of the formula (I) in which T is CH or N, n is 0, 1 or 2 and R is halogen, C1-C4alkyl or C1-C4 alkylhalide, where the radicals R may be different if n is 2; and/or b) an oxime ether of the formula (II) in which X is oxygen or amino (NH), Y is CH or N, Z is oxygen, sulphur, amino (NH) or C1-C4 alkylamino (N-C1-C4-alkyl), R' is C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkylhalide, C3-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 halogen alkenyl, C3-C6 alkinyl, C3-C6 halogen alkinyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl methyl or benzyl which may be partially of fully halogenated and/or may contain one to three of the radicals cyano, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkylhalide, C1-C4 alkoxy, C1-C4 alkoxyhalide and C1-C4 alkylthio; and c) a dinitroaniline of the formula (III).
