<CLAIMS>
A cleaning apparatus for contaminated soil, comprising a suction 
intake element (3) which can be installed in or on the soil, and at least 

one liquid-ring pump (2), downstream of which is connected a liquid 
separator (11), characterised in that connected downstream of the liquid 

separator (11) is a further liquid separator (12) which is provided with 
a filling body packing, in particular of polypropylene, and that 

connected downstream thereof is an air activated carbon filter (8 to 10) 
for receiving the harmful substances. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the liquid-ring 
pump (2) is connected to one or more gauges, wherein each individual 

gauge can be disposed independently of the other gauges in the water 
table or above the water table level. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that connected downstream of the liquid separator (11) are a liquid 

container (26) and in particular a liquid activated carbon filter. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that provided before the air activated carbon filter (8 to 10) for 

receiving the harmful substances is a throttle valve (31) and a fan (30) 
for the supply of fresh air. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that there are provided temperature, pressure and moisture measuring 

devices, as well as harmful substance measuring devices, in particular by 
means of little tubes of Dr√§ger type. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the apparatus (1) is in the form of a mobile installation.  

 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the separator (11 or 12) has an activated carbon fixed bed (56). 
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that arranged 
below the activated carbon fixed bed (56) is a tangentially disposed air 

intake (13) and provided above the activated carbon fixed bed (56) is a 
mixing chamber.
