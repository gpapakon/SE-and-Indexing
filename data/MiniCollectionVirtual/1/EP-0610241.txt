<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a surgical instrument for use in intravascular 
catheterization procedures, and more particularly to a device for positioning a 
hemostatic agent against a puncture entry wound in a blood vessel to stem the flow of 
blood therefrom following removal of the catheter and catheter introducer at the 
conclusion of the procedure. When performing angiography or angioplasty procedures, following the 
Seldinger technique, the angiography catheter or angioplasty catheter is generally 
introduced into the vascular system by first employing a sharpened hollow needle to 
penetrate the skin, the underlying muscle tissue, and to enter the selected blood vessel. 
Next, a guidewire is commonly inserted through the lumen of the hollow needle and 
made to enter the selected blood vessel. Following that, the needle is stripped off the 
guidewire and a combination of a dilator and a introducer (or an introducer alone) are 
fed over the guidewire and pushed through the skin until first the dilator and next the 
introducer enter the selected blood vessel. The guidewire may next be removed, and 
the selected catheter for carrying out the procedure is fed through the lumen of the 
introducer and advanced through the vascular system until the working end of the 
catheter is appropriately positioned. Depending upon the procedure, a dye may be 
injected through the catheter or a balloon expanded. Following the conclusion of the 
catheterization procedure, the working catheter will be withdrawn and, subsequently, 
the combination dilator and introducer will also be stripped out of the wound. Because it is common practice to administer a blood thinning agent to the 
patient prior to may of the procedures, a problem exists in stemming the flow of blood 
through the puncture wound made in the vein or artery. Typically, it is necessary to 
maintain pressure over the region for at least 30 minutes. Even more time is required 
if the patient is hypertensive or anticoagulated. When human hand pressure is utilized, 
it is somewhat wasteful of professional time. Devices, such as pressure bandages, 
sand bags or clamps may be employed, but for these devices to work, the patient must 
be compliant and motionless for this prolonged period. Also, with obese patients, 
because of the significant amount of tissue between the skin and the penetrated vessel, 
good hemostatic pressure oftentimes cannot be obtained above the penetrated artery 
or vein. Thus, a need exists for a means for accelerating hemostasis.
