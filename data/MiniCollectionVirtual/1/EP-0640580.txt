<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of 3-pentenoic acid by the reaction of 3-pentenoylchloride, 
water and butadiene. 3-chloro-1-butene and 1-chloro-2-butene 

are also formed. Preferably the 3-pentenoylchloride is formed by the 
reaction of chlorobutene with carbon monoxide using a palladium catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 3-pentenoic acid by
the reaction of a 3-pentenoylchloride, water, and butadiene in the presence
of hydrochloric acid. The resulting mixture contains 3-pentenoic acid and 3-chloro-1-butene
and 1-chloro-2-butene. The 3-pentenoylchloride is
preferably formed by the reaction of a chlorobutene selected from
3-chloro-1-butene and 1-chloro-2-butene with carbon monoxide
using a palladium catalyst. One suitable catalyst has the formula
C20H22O4PdCl, and the structural formula:
The preparation of 1-chloro-2-butene by the reaction of
butadiene and hydrogen chloride is taught in U.S. Patent 3,055,954 to
Montagna et al.The reaction of acyl halides with water to form acids is taught
in standard organic chemistry textbooks.The preparation of unsaturated carboxylic acid halides by the
reaction of 1-chloro-2-butene (crotyl chloride) and carbon monoxide and a
palladium catalyst is taught in U.S. Patent 3,338,961 to Closson et al. See
example 8 in particular. In example 5 the patent shows evaporation under
vacuum prior to distillation of the product. Journal of the Chemical Society,
1964, pages 1588-1594, describes the use of palladium chloride complexes to
react 3-chloro-1-butene with carbon monoxide to form 3-pentenoyl chloride.
See table 2, page 1589.GB-A-987274 discloses the preparation of halides of
unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids by contracting a halogenated
olefin with CO in the presence of Pd, a complex or salt thereof at a
temperature of no more than 250Â°C and a pressure of no more
than 3000 atmospheres GB-1080867 discloses the preparation of a
halide, anhydride or ester by reacting an olefin in a non-aqueous
medium with CO in the presence of a halide or a Ti-complex
of palladium, rhodium or ruthenium, derived from the metal halide
and the olefinic reactant.3-pentenoic acid is an intermediate in the preparation of adipic
acid from butadiene. See Burke U.S Patent 4,788,333. Adipic acid is a
monomer used in the preparation of 6,6 nylon.It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for
the production of 3-pentenoic acid and 3-chloro-1-butene and 1-chloro-2-butene
by a process in which less yield loss due to the formation of
chlorovaleric acid than is obtained when these desired products are formed
in separate reactions.The present invention is a process for the simultaneous
preparation of 3-pentenoic acid, 3-chloro-1-butene and 1-chloro-2-butene
which comprises:
a) combining 3-pentenoylchloride with water, butadiene, and
hydrochloric acid to form a
