<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method for preparing hybridomas, 
which comprises the steps of: quickly and deeply freezing 

hair-bulb of follicle isolated from a human or an animal 
of species A; immunizing an animal of species B by subcutaneously 

administering thawed hair-bulb to 
said animal; re-immunizing said animal by intravenously and 

intraperitoneally administering liquid and solid components 
of the hair-bulb which are obtained with centrifugation of 

the thawed hair-bulb to said animal; fusing spleen cells or 
lymphoid cells isolated from the immunized animal with 

myeloma cells derived from an animal of species B or C, and 
cloning fusion cells which produce antibodies capable of 

specifically binding to the hair follicle of human or animal 
of species A. 
The hybridomas prepared by the above method can produce 
monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing hair follicle 

tissues, and these antibodies enable functional analysis of 
hair follicle in addition to development of new diagnostic 

and therapeutic means for abnormal hair development, alopecia, 
etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing
hybridomas which produces monoclonal antibodies against
hair follicle tissues.The monoclonal antibodies obtainable by this
invention are very effective markers of hair follicle
tissues which are deeply involved in the differentiation
and growth of hairs. They also enable analysis of the
function of each hair follicle tissue and/or
specification of the hair cycle, and are useful for
research and development of new diagnostic methods,
therapeutic methods and therapeutic drugs, etc., for
treatment of abnormal hair development and/or alopecia.Abstract No. 1373 of the Journal of Cell Biology
115 No. 3 Part 2, 1991, p236a discloses the development
of monoclonal antibodies against mouse vibrissa
follicles. JP-A-5219981 discloses the preparation of
monoclonal antibodies against mouse hair matrix cells.The part of the hair base embedded in the skin is
called hair follicle and consists of plural different
tissues, forming a characteristic structure as shown in
Fig. 1. Recently, it has become clear that these
tissues are deeply involved in the differentiation and
growth of hairs. However, there are still many unknown
points with respect to the 
function of each tissue, and elucidation of differentiation
factors and growth factors responsible for exchange of
information between the tissues is an important issue to be
solved in the future.In general, the hair has a rhythm of growth, and, as
depicted in Fig. 2, the hair cycle proceeds from the growing
stage (anagen) to the degeneration or transition stage
(catagen), resting stage (telogen) and the growing stage
again. In the growing stage, the whole hair follicle extends
to reach the deep region of the skin, and the hair
matrix, which causes extension of the hair, is formed, and
the dermal papilla, which is believed to be necessary for
the formation of the hair matrix, develops. In the degeneration
or transition stage, the activity of the hair matrix
ceases, and the dermal papilla shrinks. Accompanying these
changes, the hair follicle shrinks and enters the resting
stage. When the hair enters the growing stage again, the
dermal papilla is reorganized, followed by extension of the
hair follicle and formation of new hair matrix. The ratio
of hairs at each stage of the hair cycle differs depending
on age of individuals and the site of the hair, and these
data can be used as a rough index of the health condition of
his/her hairs.The ratio of hairs at each stage of the hair cycle has
been determined mainly based on
