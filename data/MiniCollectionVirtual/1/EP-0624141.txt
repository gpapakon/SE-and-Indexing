<ABSTRACT>
A package tray serves to store liquid-containing food products, such as meat. The tray is made of e.g. sheeting and has a storage space which - seen in the normal position of rest of the tray - is downwardly defined by a base (11) and by upright side walls (10) along the sides. The base is formed with a plurality of ridges (17) having upwardly converging walls. In a zone of the base (11) between the side walls (10) and a predetermined central area (2) the height of the ridges (17) increases successively with the distance from the side walls (10), and the base (11) in this zone slopes downwards and inwards toward the central area (2). Exuding liquid, e.g. blood and tissue fluids from meat, runs to this central area (2) where it will be concealed to the buying public. The collected liquid in the central area (2) is kept spaced from the packaged food products by means of the ridges (17) in the area. Therefore, a packaged food product exuding liquid can be kept dry in the package tray even when stored for an extended period of time in e.g. a refrigerated display case, while the food product generally makes an aesthetic and hygenic impression on the customers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a package tray for liquid-containing 
food products, such as meat, said package tray being 
made of e.g. sheeting and having a storage space which - 
seen in the normal position of rest of the tray - is defined 
downwardly by a bottom and by upright side walls 
along the sides, said bottom being provided with a plurality 
of projections having upwardly converging walls. Today such trays are used in very large numbers for the 
distribution of ready-for-sale food products, which are 
placed in the trays, which are generally then coated with 
a thin, transparent plastics sheet permitting the customers 
to inspect the respective article. The food products 
can hereby be displayed freely accessibly in refrigerated 
display cases in retail outlets, from which the customers, 
according to the self-service principle, can then select 
and pick up the article which appeals most to them. It goes without saying that the appearance plays a decisive 
role. However, during the stay in these refrigerated 
display cases e.g. fresh meat tends to release blood and 
other tissue fluids in which the meat is then partly immersed 
in conventional trays. The customers find this unsightly 
and unhygienic, and this is later a major nuisance 
to the consumer when the consumer unpacks the soaked meat, 
because the consumer and the surroundings can easily get 
soiled by the dripping blood. To this should be added that 
the part of the meat which has been immersed in blood and 
tissue fluids for an extended period of time can undergo 
changes which impair the quality and freshness of the 
meat. For example, it has been found that the affected 
areas of the meat may be a hotbed of a rapidly growing  
 
bacteria flora. It has been attempted to solve the above-mentioned problems 
by means of a tray which is described in GB patent 
specification 813 415. The bottom of this tray is provided 
with narrow grooves for conveying the juice to some collection 
pockets, but between the grooves there are some 
relatively large, plane faces on which the blood and the 
tissue fluid remain owing to the capillary effect. This 
construction cannot therefore effectively drain off the 
exuding juices from the meat. The tray is moreover made of 
moulded pulp which tends to absorb meat juice and is not 
attractive as a package owing to its structure and colour. GB patent specification 974 180 discloses a thin walled 
tray of thermoplastics having longitudinal and transverse 
ribs in the bottom. The distance of the ribs from the

A package tray for liquid-containing food products, 
such as meat, made of e.g. sheeting and having a storage 

space which - seen in the normal position of rest of the 
tray - is defined downwardly by a base (11; 30; 50) and by 

upright side walls (10) along the sides, said base being 
provided with a plurality of projections (17; 20; 31; 41; 

52) having upwardly converging walls, 
characterized
 
in that the walls of each of said projections 

converge to form an apex (19), and in that between the 
side walls (10) and the central area the base (11; 30; 50) 

has a zone where the height of the projections (17; 20; 
31; 41; 52) increases successively with the distance from 

the side walls (10), and that the base (11; 30; 50) in 
this zone slopes downwards and inwards toward the central 

area. 
A package tray according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the projections in the central area 

have substantially the same heigth. 
A package tray according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized
 
in that it comprises a skirt (14) 

which extends downwardly on the outer side of the side 
walls (10) from the upper rim (12) of these. 
A package tray according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the height of the skirt is greater 

than that of the side walls. 
A package tray according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
 
in that the height of the skirt (14) 

is selected such that together with the central area (4) 
it rests on a plane, horizontal support when the storage  

 
space of the tray is filled with the desired product and 

the tray is in, the position of rest. 
A package tray according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the skirt - seen in a vertical section 

in the position of rest of the tray - extends slightly, 
e.g. 1-2 mm, downwardly beyond the base when this is 

unloaded. 
A package tray according to any of claims 1-6, 
characterized
 
in that the projections (20; 41) have 

the shape of cones or truncated cones with rounded tops. 
A package tray according to claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that the area of each top is determined 

by the surface pressure between the top and the food product 
part which rests on the top in use being slightly 

smaller than the pressure which the surface of the food 
product can resist without being perforated. 
A package tray according to any of claims 1-8, 
characterized
 
in that the projections (17; 20; 31; 

41; 52) are distributed across the base with a mutual distance 
which does not exceed the transverse dimensions of 

the respective projections at the foot. 
A package tray according to any of claims 1-9, 
characterized
 
in that the projections have the same 

transverse dimensions at the foot.
