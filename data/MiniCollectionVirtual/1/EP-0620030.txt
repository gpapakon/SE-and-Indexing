<ABSTRACT>
The automatic ski-binding has the heel-holder for the ski-boot (4) joined off-centre to the binding unit (3). Thus the lengthwise axis (1) of the holder diverges to the side (5) from that (2) of the binding unit. This divergence can be adjustable and lockable. It can be determined by the wall thickness of the holder, or the latter can be inclined to the axis (2).

<CLAIMS>
Ski binding unit (3) with heel automat - with heel restraint (4), marked by means of
heel restraint (4) being tied decentralized with the binding unit (3) for the ski boot,

resulting in an angular deviation (5) to the side by the heel restraint longitudinal
axis (1) in the longitudinal diredtion of the ski in relation to the binding unit

longitudinal axis (2), and therefore the heel of the ski boot is being transposed to
the side of the binding unit longitude axis.
Ski binding unit (3) with heel automat - as per claim 1 marked by means of the
decentralization of the heel restraint (4) being set variably in relation to the side and

can be fixed at will.
Ski binding unit (3) with heel automat - as per claim 1 marked by means of the fact
that the decentralization of the heel restraint (4) to the side is being accomplished by

the corresponding strength of the wallmaterial of the heel restraint.
Ski binding unit (3) with heel automat - as per claim 1 marked by means of the fact
that the decentralization of the heel restraint (4) to the side is being done to the

binding unit.
