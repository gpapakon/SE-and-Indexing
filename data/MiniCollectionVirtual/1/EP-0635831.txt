<ABSTRACT>
A cassette holding means for magnetic tape cassettes which can be introduced lengthwise is proposed, in which means the arresting devices (14) provided for tape arresting are attached on a transversely displaceable sliding element (3). Formed on the sliding element (3) on both sides are control wedges (9) which, when a magnetic tape cassette (23) is pushed in, come into contact with a bead (24, 25) formed on the flat sides of the magnetic tape cassette (23) and are pushed away laterally by the said bead. As a result, the sliding element (3) with the arresting devices (14) is aligned exactly with the position of the reel hubs (26).

<CLAIMS>
A cassette holder for magnetic tape cassettes insertable in the
longitudinal direction, which has locking means that engage in the reel

hubs of the magnetic tape cassettes and are aligned in the insertion
direction, and a base plate on which there is mounted a lockable slider

that is arranged to be extended by means of a spring, thus taking the
magnetic tape cassettes into a removal position, a sliding element having

lateral control wedges and displaceable by the magnetic tape cassette
transversely to the insertion direction being mounted in the base plate,

and which cassette holder has pivoting elements with which the locking
means can be pivoted into the reel hubs, characterized in that for each

reel hub (26, 27) a locking means (14, 15) is mounted on the transversely
displaceable sliding element (3), and on the longitudinally displaceable

slider (2) there are arranged control edges (18, 19; 20, 21) which, with the
sliding element (3) displaced to one side and on longitudinal displacement

of the slider (2), act on a pivoting member (12, 13) projecting from an
actuating element of the locking means (14, 15) and thereby pivot the

locking means (14, 15).
A cassette holder according to claim 1, characterized in that the
actuating element of each locking means (14, 15) is a respective shaft (16,

17) which projects from both sides of the associated locking means (14,
15) and has at its two free ends radially projecting pivoting members (12,

13).
A cassette holder according to claim 2, characterized in that the
transversely displaceable sliding element (3) is arranged in a recess of the

base plate (1) below a supporting tongue (11) projecting from the 
longitudinally displaceable slider (2), and the control edges (18, 19; 20,

21) are arranged on the underside of the supporting tongue (11).
A cassette holder according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that centring elements (7, 8) in the form of inclined faces

are arranged on the longitudinally displaceable slider (2), which elements
in the end position of the extended slider (2) meet the control wedges (9,

10) of the sliding element (3) and displace the latter into a central position.
A cassette holder according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that in the central position of the sliding element (3) the

control edges (18, 19; 20, 21) are ineffective.
A cassette holder according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the cassette holder is an insert, which on its base

plate (1) has means with which it is arranged to be inserted in a container
housing and be connected thereto.
