<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve arrangement for a hydraulic delivery device, in particular a steering booster pump, with a pressure-relief valve arranged in a control piston of a flow-regulating valve. In this valve arrangement, a control line connecting a working connection to the pressure-relief side of the flow-regulating valve can be provided in a simple manner. To this end, provision is made for the control line connecting the working connection to the pressure-relief side of the flow-regulating valve (32) to be run through the control piston (30) of the flow-regulating valve and a closing body (72) of the pressure-relief valve (74).

A valve arrangement for an hydraulic conveying device, in particular for a power 
steering pump, having a pressure relief valve arranged in a control piston of a flow 

regulating valve, characterised in that a control line connecting an operating connection 
(18) to a pressure relieving side of the flow regulating valve (32) is passed through the 

control piston (30) of the flow regulating valve (32) and through a closing body (72) of 
the pressure relief valve (74). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the control piston 
(30) has a blind bore (60) in which the closing body (72) is arranged, and the closing 

body (72) has a through opening (90) which is in alignment with a through opening (bore 
52) of the control piston (30) opening out at the operating connection (18). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the blind bore (60) is closed by a stopper (64, 110) having a through opening to a 

region (94) of an interior space (14) of a valve housing (12). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the stopper (64) is in the form of a sleeve (66) which reaches through an interior 

space of the control piston (30) and within which the closing body (72) is axially 
displaceable against the force of a spring member (78). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that an annular element (76) is forced into the sleeve (66), the spring member (78) 

which acts upon the closing body (72) with spring force being supported on the end face 
of this annular element (76). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the closing body (72) has an axial extension (88) which guides the closing body 

(72) within the annular element (76). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the control piston (30) and the sleeve (66) have at least one aligned, radial,  

 
through bore (98) which opens out in an annular chamber (100) connected to a channel 

(102) going to a lower pressure level. 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that a central sleeve (116) reaches through the stopper (110) and extends over the blind 

bore (60). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any nne of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the closing body (120) is mounted on the sleeve (116) so as to be axially 

displaceable against the force of a spring member (122). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the stopper (64, 1 10) has an edge (84, 132) forming a seat valve together with a 

surface (82, 130) of the closing body (72, 120). 
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the sleeve (116) has at least one through opening (134) connected to a recess (126) 

of the stopper (110), this recess (126) being closable by the seat valve.
