<ABSTRACT>
The method described provides for the footwear to 
be struck by light beams from two sides thereof, for a 

plurality of points on the edge of the shadow projected 
by the footwear to be detected on respective opposite 

sides, and for the profile of the footwear in the plane 
of the sole to be derived from the positions of the 

points detected and from the geometrical 
characteristics of the light beams. Equipment for 

obtaining the profile of footwear automatically during 
manufacture with the use of this method is described, 

and comprises means for causing the footwear to pass 
through a detection plane, and two photoelectric 

devices (16, 19) disposed in the detection plane and 
constituted by light emitters (16a, 16b, 19a, 19b) and 

light receivers (16c, 19c) which are switched on and 
scanned in succession. These devices define pairs of 

straight lines (t1, t2) which are tangential to the 
footwear and each of which passes through an emitter 

which is switched on and through a receiver. The 
intersections of the pairs of straight lines, in 

association with the position of the footwear along its 
line of advance, define the profile of the footwear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to equipment for the 
automated mass-production of footwear and, more 
particularly, to a method and equipment for detecting 
the profile of an item of footwear in the plane of the 
sole during manufacture. An industrial footwear-production cycle provides 
for various steps which are carried out in succession 
and which require the tools of the respective machines 
to move along the same path. For example, two steps of 
this type are the roughing of the edge of the upper 
which has been folded and glued to an internal support 
sole known as an insole board, and the deposition of 
adhesive on the roughened surface for the subsequent 
application of a sole thereto. As is known, in the 
footwear industry, a step, the object of which is to 
roughen the surface of the leather of the upper in 
order to prepare it for gluing, is called roughing. In order to carry out the roughing, the 
semi-finished product, fitted on a suitable last fixed 
to a movable support, is brought beneath a roughing 
machine and is processed by the roughing tool which is 
guided along the profile of the footwear in the plane 
of the sole, that is, along the "false edge" which 
divides the surface of the upper which, upon completion  
 
of the processing, will remain in view, from its folded 
edge which is glued to the insole board and to which 
the sole will be applied. During the next step of the process, the 
semi-finished product is brought, on its last, under an 
adhesive-dispensing machine which applies a layer of 
adhesive to the roughed edge of the upper, that is, to 
the surface to which the sole is to be glued, by means 
of a movable dispenser which follows a path 
substantially identical to that of the roughing tool. Other steps which may be carried out by a tool 
which is guided along the same path are pre-roughing in 
order to remove residues of the process in which the 
upper is glued to the insole board, and brushing, which 
may be carried out after each step, such as roughing, 
which is accompanied by the formation of particles and 
dust. The use of machines which can be programmed so 
that the tool follows the desired path in order to 
carry out these processes along the profile of the 
footwear automatically is known (e.g. from EP-A-0 512 773). 
The programming may be 
of the analog type, when the path is determined by 
means of a template having the shape and dimensions of 
the footwear to be manufactured, or of the digital 
type, when the path is determined by an electronic  
 
control

A method of detecting the profile of an item of 
footwear (10, 11) in the plane of the sole during manufacture, 

characterized in that it provides for the following 
steps: 


striking the footwear with first and second sets 
of light beams from first and second sides of the 

footwear, respectively, 
detecting a plurality of points on the edge of the 
shadow projected by the footwear on respective sides 

opposite the first and second sides, and 
deriving points on the profile of the footwear in 
the plane of the sole from the positions of the points 

detected and from the geometrical characteristics of 
the light beams. 
Equipment for detecting the profile of an item of 
footwear (10, 11) in the plane of the sole during 

manufacture, characterized in that it comprises: 

translation means (15) for moving the footwear in the 
direction of its longitudinal axis, transverse to 

a detection plane, 
position transducer means for detecting the 
position of the footwear relative to a predetermined 

reference point,

the right-hand and left-hand half-profiles, 
respectively, point by point, each of the devices
