<ABSTRACT>
A unidirectional sprocket (10) includes a hub 
(12) and a series of radially arrayed sprocket teeth 

(14). Each of the sprocket teeth (14) include a root (16) 
at the point of connection with the hub (12), a radially 

extending split body (31) and twin outwardly projecting 
points at the distal or outermost end. Forward and 

rearward flanks (20,22) extend from the root (16) radially 
outwardly, while forward and rearward faces (24,26) 

extend radially inwardly from the pitch circle (P). 
Each of the sprocket teeth (14) is asymmetrical with a 

forward offset. Each of the teeth (14) also includes a 
forward landing area (28) formed above the forward 

flank (20) and a rearward landing area (30) formed above the 
rearward flank (22). Together, the forward and rearward 

faces (24,26) and landing areas (28,30) of adjacent teeth (14) define a 
split chain link seat (S) for engaging the chain (C) 

being driven. The rearward landing area (30) is longer than 
the forward landing area (28) due to the forward offset, and 

the forward landing area (28) is raised with respect to the 
rearward landing area (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
chain drive systems and, more particularly, to a 
sprocket for utilization on heavy equipment, such as 
armored face conveyors and beam stage loaders. It has long been known in the art to drive a 
conveyor chain, such as utilized on armored face 
conveyors, by means of a specially designed sprocket 
including spaced teeth for engaging the sequential 
horizontal links of the chain. While such a drive 
system is efficient and effective for this and other 
purposes, rapid wear of the teeth can be a serious 
problem. Specifically, the harsh operating environment 
of mining equipment is the primary cause of tooth wear. 
As a result of heavy loading, relatively high operating 
speeds and the presence of particulate material, 
including coal fines, sand, and small rock particles, 
trapped at the driving interface between the sprocket 
tooth and chain, wear is accelerated. Accordingly, the 
service life of the sprocket is drastically reduced. As a result, productivity is lost through the  
 
need to relatively frequently take the conveyor out-of-service 
for repair. To a lesser degree, conveyor drive 
chains are vulnerable to this wear and must be 
periodically repaired or replaced. More specifically, 
as the driving face of the sprocket teeth wear, the 
conveyor flights, each including a crossbar and clamp, 
that pass through selected, spaced horizontal links for 
pushing the coal or other aggregate material, 
eventually come into contact with the teeth. This 
results in interference and jamming of the conveyor. 
The interference engagement occurs between the trailing 
face of each flight and the leading flank of the next 
tooth. When this occurs, it usually necessitates 
replacement of the entire sprocket, which is not only 
time consuming, but very costly. In the prior art, sprockets have typically 
incorporated teeth with a symmetrical profile, that is 
the point of each tooth is centered with respect to its 
root and body. In this way, substantially equal 
clearance is provided between the flights at the point 
where they extend through the horizontal chain links, 
and both flanks of the teeth. This approach does allow 
for maximum clearance between the flights and the teeth 
in both directions for efficient bidirectional 
operation of the conveyor. However, the one drawback of this design is 
that most of the wear on the teeth of a sprocket in 
mining conveyors, and in other similar applications, 
occurs in the predominately utilized, forward driving 
direction.

<CLAIMS>
A unidirectional sprocket (10) for engaging a 
chain (C) during driving rotation and providing an extended 

service life, comprising: 

a hub (12); 
an array of sprocket teeth (14) substantially 
radially extending from said hub (12) and defining a pitch 

circle (P); each sprocket tooth including a root (16) at a 
point of connection with said hub, an outwardly projecting 

point (18) forming a distal end from the pitch circle 
outwardly, a forward drive face (24) and rearward face (26) 

extending inwardly from the pitch circle, forward and rearward 
flanks (20, 22) extending outwardly from said root (16), and 

forward and rearward landing areas (28, 30) extending between 
said faces (24, 26) and said flanks (20, 22); 
said sprocket (10) being characterized by said 
sprocket teeth (14) each being asymmetrical and positioned 

with a forward offset toward the forward flank (20) in the 
direction of driving rotation, and with respect to said root 

(16); 
whereby extended wear capability is provided in the 
forward direction to increase the life of the sprocket. 
The sprocket set forth in Claim 1,
 
wherein the forward and rearward landing areas of 

adjacent teeth define a chain seat for engaging the  
 

horizontal links of the chain.

wherein said rearward landing area (30) is longer than 

said forward landing area (28).

and forward landing areas (28, 30) as measured at said 
pitch circle (P) is between substantially 1.5:1 and

millimeters thick between said forward and rearward 
faces (24, 26) at said pitch circle (P).

wherein the distance (1) between said root (16) and 

said forward landing area (28) is between substantially

is between substantially 57 - 64 millimeters at the 

trailing edge (34).
