<ABSTRACT>
In a device for connecting at least one implement having a drawbar (54) to a traction vehicle having a hauling device, the drawbar (54) being connectable at its front end to the hauling device and the traction vehicle being provided with at least two conduit connections which are connected or connectable to a pressure source located on the vehicle and to a reservoir located on the vehicle and which can be connected to a double-acting piston cylinder (60) engaging at one end on the drawbar (54) and possessing a control valve (72), the drawbar (54) is articulated vertically pivotably at its rear end, via a pivoting connection, on a drawbar part (28) connected to the implement, the double-acting cylinder (60) engaging at its other end on the drawbar part (28) and in a manner offset relative to the pivoting connection, and the cylinder (60) being connected to the conduit connections in such a way that, in the event of an extension of the piston rod, a force directed downwards is exerted on the hauling device.

A device with a drawbar (54), a drawbar part (28) and a double-acting piston-cylinder 
(60) for connecting at least one implement (10, 12) to a towing vehicle 

having a towing device, wherein the drawbar (54) can be connected to the towing 
device at its front end and the towing vehicle is provided with at least two line 

connectors which are connected to or can be connected to a pressure source on the 
vehicle side and a reservoir on the vehicle side and which can be connected to the 

double-acting piston-cylinder (60) engaging at one end on the drawbar (54), wherein 
the drawbar (54) is vertically pivotally hinged at its rear end by means of a swivel 

connection on the drawbar part (28) which can be connected to the implement (10, 12), 
the double-acting cylinder (60) engages at its other end on the drawbar part (28), offset 

from the swivel connection, the cylinder (60) is so connected to the line connectors 
that a downwardly directed force is exerted on the towing device when the piston rod 

is extended, and the cylinder chamber at the closed end of the cylinder (60) can be 
connected to the line connector leading to the pressure source on the vehicle side 

through a connection, characterized in that the device further comprises a control valve 
(72) provided in this connection and designed to interrupt this connection, which closes 

on reaching a predetermined pressure which is lower than the system pressure on the 
vehicle side or the operating pressure of the pressure source on the vehicle side. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the predetermined pressure 
can be selectively adjusted. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the control valve (72) 
can be connected through an inlet line (74) to the line connector leading to the vehicle 

side pressure source and through a return flow line (78) to the line connector leading 
to the vehicle side reservoir and has an outlet line (82) which is connected to the 

cylinder chamber at the closed end of the cylinder (60). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the control valve (72) can 
assume a first position in which the input line (74) is connected to the outlet line (82),  

 
a second position in which the outlet line (82) is blocked and a third position in which 

the outlet line (82) is connected to the return flow line (78), wherein an adjustable 
spring (90) is provided and acts against the pilot pressure in the outlet line (82) and is 

biased to urge the control valve (72) into its first position. 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the pressure chamber opposite the cylinder chamber at the closed end of the 

cylinder (60) is connected through a line (84) to the return flow line (78), while this 
line (84) is connected to the outlet line (82) and a check valve (88) is so arranged in 

this connection (86) that a fluid connection is only permitted from the line (84) to the 
outlet line (82). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that the piston rod of the cylinder (60) engages vertically above the swivel connection 
on the drawbar part (28). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that a second implement (10) can be latched to the drawbar part (28) and runs beside 

the first implement (12) in the working position and behind the first implement (12) in 
the transport position, both implements being provided with ground wheels (18, 22).
