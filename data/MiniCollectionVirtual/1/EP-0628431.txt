<ABSTRACT>
For the multi-coloured marking of identification cards and the like, the multilayer identification card receives an outer coloured layer (3) of a first colour and an inner coloured layer (2) of a second colour. While the outer coloured layer absorbs practically no laser-beam light used for marking, the second inner coloured layer absorbs the laser light. By this means, in the marking process, the material of the second coloured layer is degraded thermally, that is to say evaporated, sublimated or subjected to a chemical or physical reaction, with the consequence that the first layer is blasted away in particles by means of the formation of pressure. By this means, the second coloured layer becomes visible. Instead of the second coloured layer, provision can also be made of a transparent lacquer layer having corresponding properties, in order, as an example, to expose a multi-coloured security printed image under this transparent lacquer layer.

A data carrier, in particular identity card, having 
an outer layer or coating which visibly changes its color or 

contrast with the surroundings under the action of a laser 
beam, characterized in that at least this layer has a relief 

structure, preferably in the form of semicylindrical elements, 
hemispherical elements, corrugated structures or the 

like, and information is recorded at an acute angle to the 
data carrier plane in the area of said relief structure by 

means of a laser beam, the slopes of the relief structure 
facing the recording direction being inscribed differently to 

the slopes facing away therefrom so that the information thus 
recorded appears in different forms depending on the particular 

viewing angle. 
A method for inscribing a data carrier, in particular 
identity card, having an outer layer or coating which visibly 

changes its color or contrast with the surroundings under the 
action of a laser beam, characterized in that a relief structure, 

preferably in the form of semicylindrical elements, 
hemispherical elements, corrugated st
ructures and the like, 
is incorporated at least in this layer, and information is 

recorded at an acute angle to the data carrier plane in the 
area of said relief structure by means of a laser beam, the 

slopes of the relief structure facing the recording direction 
being inscribed differently to the slopes facing away therefrom 

so that the information thus recorded appears in different 
forms depending on the particular viewing angle.
