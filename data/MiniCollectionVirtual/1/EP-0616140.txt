<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical element (e.g. a gear (G)) made of synthetic resin has an 
integrally formed axially extending elastic lock member (21) with at its 

tip a claw (22) for engaging a groove (3) in a shaft (S) to mount the 
mechanical element on the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure for mounting 
mechanical element to shaft, more particularly to a structure 
for mounting mechanical element to shaft which may prevent the 
mechanical element mounted to the shaft such as a gear, a cam, 
a roller or the like from falling off from the shaft. Conventionally, a C-shaped metal snap ring is used for 
preventing the mechanical element mounted to the shaft from 
falling off from the shaft. Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a 
known example using the snap ring. A gear 20 being the 
mechanical element is fit to a shaft 10, and is prevented from 
falling off from the shaft 10 by a snap ring 30 fit to a 
peripheral groove 10a in the shaft 10. Said metal snap ring 30 has, however, a high rigidity so 
that in order to fit this with the peripheral groove 10a of 
the shaft 10, it is necessary to expand the snap ring 30 using 
a special tool. Therefore, an operation for fitting the snap 
ring 30 into the peripheral groove 10a in the shaft 10 
requires much labor. This lowers operation efficiency in 
mounting the gear to the shaft, thus increasing the 
manufacturing cost.  In addition, movement of the gear 20 in only one 
direction can be prevented by one snap ring 30. Whereas if 
the gear 20 needs to be secured in a predetermined position, 
it becomes necessary to mount two snap rings 30 to the shaft 
10 so as to sandwich the gear 20 between these two snap rings 
30. This calls for much more labor for fitting the snap rings 
30 into the peripheral groove 10a in the shaft 10, thus 
increasing further manufacturing cost. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
structure for mounting the mechanical element to the shaft 
which realizes an easy and less costly operation for mounting 
the mechanical element such as a gear and others to the shaft. Another object of the invention is to provide a structure 
for mounting the mechanical element to the shaft which can 
secure the mechanical element mounted to the shaft in a 
predetermined position easily and less costly. The above objects may be achieved by the following 
structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft comprising:
 
   a mechanical element made of synthetic resin fit to the 
shaft; and
 
   a lock member for preventing the mechanical element from 
falling off from the shaft, the lock member including:
 
   an elastic piece integrally formed with the mechanical 
element, extending axially from an end surface of the  
 
mechanical element, and elastically being deformable

<CLAIMS>
A structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft 
comprising: 

   a mechanical element made of synthetic resin which is fit 
to a shaft; and 

   a lock member for preventing said mechanical element from 
falling off from the shaft, said lock member including: 

   an elastic piece integrally formed with said 
mechanical element, extending axially from an end surface of 

said mechanical element, and elastically being deformable away 
from the shaft in the direction of the diameter of the shaft; 

and 
   a claw formed at a tip of said elastic piece and being 

engaged with a groove formed in the shaft. 
A structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft as 
set forth in claim 1, wherein said claw of the lock member has 

a guide surface adapted to contact with an end portion of the 
shaft when fitting said mechanical element to the shaft so as 

to elastically deform said elastic piece away from the shaft, 
thereby guiding a tip of said claw to the outer periphery of 

the shaft. 
A structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft as 
 

set forth in claim 1, wherein a finger hook for hooking a 
finger when elastically deforming said elastic piece is 

provided at a tip portion of said elastic piece. 
A structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft as 
set forth in claim 1, wherein said claw of the lock member has 

a first engagement surface coming in contact with the groove 
in the shaft to prevent the mechanical element from falling 

off from the shaft, and a second engagement surface coming in 
contact with the groove in the shaft to prevent said 

mechanical element from moving in the opposite direction of 
said mechanical element falling off from the shaft. 
A structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft as 
set forth in claim 1, wherein said structure has a plurality 

of the lock members. 
A structure for mounting mechanical element to shaft as 
set forth in claim 1, wherein said claw is integrally formed 

with the mechanical element and the elastic piece.
