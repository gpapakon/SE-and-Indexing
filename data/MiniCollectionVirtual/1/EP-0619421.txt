<ABSTRACT>
An engine control system is disclosed for 
reducing the hydrocarbon content in the exhaust gas of 

a crankcase scavenged, two-stroke engine (10) in the 
operating range near idle, with light operator induced 

engine loading. As operator demand for engine output 
power is increased, the control system increases the 

fuel per cylinder supplied to the engine while 
restricting the supplied mass of air per cylinder to a 

value less than that flowing at unloaded engine idle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to control system for 
a crankcase scavenged, two-stroke engine, and more 
particularly to a control system for reducing the 
exhaust gas hydrocarbons emitted from such an engine. In conventional four-stroke engines, as 
operator demand for engine power is increased from 
idle, the amount of air per cylinder supplied to the 
engine is typically increased. Concurrently, the 
quantity of fuel delivered per cylinder is also 
increased, thereby maintaining the desired air-fuel 
ratio to achieve the desired engine performance and 
emission objectives. The structure and operation of crankcase 
scavenged, two-stroke engines differ in many respects 
from that of conventional four-stroke engines. One 
difference concerns the manner in which fresh air is 
inducted, and burned fuel is exhausted by the engines. 
Conventional four-stroke engines have intake and 
exhaust valves within the cylinders to accomplish 
these tasks. Crankcase scavenged, two-stroke engines 
do not employ intake and exhaust valves but rather, 
intake and exhaust ports which open directly through 
the walls of the engine cylinders. As combustion is 
initiated, the piston moves in its down stroke within 
a cylinder, uncovering the exhaust port for release of 
the burned fuel, and shortly thereafter, uncovering 
the intake port to enable the entry of a fresh air 
charge, and assist in expulsion of the combustion 
components of the burned fuel. A problem associated with crankcase 
scavenged, two-stroke engines has been the high level 
of hydrocarbons present in the exhaust gas. At speeds 
near engine idle, with light operator induced loading, 
the level of exhaust gas hydrocarbons is highly  
 
dependent upon the amount of air per cylinder 
delivered to the engine. This relationship is thought 
to result from the absence of valves in the two-stroke 
engine, and the near simultaneous opening of the 
exhaust and intake ports during the engine operating 
cycle. Presumably, an excessive quantity of air 
flowing through the intake port forces an amount of 
unburned fuel out of the exhaust port thereby 
increasing the hydrocarbon content of the exhaust gas. If the conventional practice of increasing 
the mass air per cylinder flowing to the engine is 
followed in controlling the near idle operation of a 
crankcase scavenged, two-stroke engine upon operator 
demand for output power, the level of hydrocarbons in 
the engine exhaust may be unreasonably high. 
Consequently, a need exists for an alternative engine 
control for such

<CLAIMS>
A control system for a crankcase 
scavenged, two-stroke engine (10), comprising an air 

intake manifold (20) for induction of air to the 
engine, the air intake manifold having a throttle body 

(48) with a bore through which air flows and a 
throttle plate (44) positioned in the bore and 

rotatable therein to regulate the flow of air 
therethrough, the throttle plate being rotatable from 

a positive position of maximum air flow and minimum 
bore obstruction through a centre position of minimum 

air flow and maximum bore obstruction to a negative 
position corresponding to an air flow and bore 

obstruction representing a steady state condition of 
unloaded engine idle and operable to reduce air flow 

to the engine as the throttle plate is rotated from 
the negative, steady state position to the centre 

position and to increase air flow to the engine as the 
throttle plate is rotated from the centre position to 

the positive position, the air intake manifold further 
comprising means (52) for increasing fuel supplied to 

the engine as the throttle plate rotates from the 
negative position to the positive position, the 

control system being operable to reduce air flow and 
increase fuel flow to the engine as the throttle plate 

rotates from the negative, idle position through the 
centre position and to increase air flow and fuel flow 

as the throttle plate rotates from the centre position 
to the positive position. 
A control system as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the fuel increasing means comprises a throttle 

plate position sensing means (52). 
A method of controlling a crankcase 
scavenged two-stroke engine (10) using a control 

system as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2.
