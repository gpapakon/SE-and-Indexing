<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a communication system using a 
bi-directional bus, which includes a plurality of devices 

(e.g., TV image receiver or video tape recorder, etc.) 
connected to each other. Each device comprises a transmit 

signal formation unit adapted to form a transmit signal 
having a frame structure consisting of an address field for 

specifying addresses of devices between which communication 
is carried out, a control field for specifying a data 

communication command indicating communication of data or a 
control command communication command indicating 

communication of control command, whereby, in transmitting 
data, the device specifies the content of the control field 

of the leading frame as the data communication command to 
form the transmit signal; a bus output unit for outputting 

the transmit signal formed by the transmit signal formation 
unit to the bi-directional bus; a bus input unit adapted to 

receive the bi-directional bus; and a control unit for 
detecting on the basis of the content of the control field 

of the leading frame of the transmit signal received by the 
bus input unit whether current communication is 

communication of data or communication of control command, 
whereby when communication of data is detected, the control 

unit recognizes that the content of the data field of this 
frame is specified as data to carry out a control to receive 

data. In addition, there are also disclosed a transmitting 
method, a receiving method and a communication method which 

can be applied to such a bi-directional bus system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bi-directional bus system
and to transmitting and receiving
methods therefor which may be used in a system in which
devices, e.g., a television image receiver or a video tape
recorder, etc. are connected to each other by using a
bi-directional bus to control, from other devices,
sub-devices, e.g., a monitor image receiver, a TV tuner, or
a video deck, etc. included in the devices, or to display
the operating states, etc. of other devices on the
television image receiver.In recent years, there have been popularly used
systems in which a plurality of items of audio or visual
equipment (hereinafter referred to as AV equipment) are
connected by means of video signal lines or audio signal
lines (hereinafter referred to as AV signal lines).In such AV systems, items of equipment are
connected by means of a system control bus (hereinafter
simply referred to as a bi-directional bus) in addition to
the above-described AV signal lines to control respective
items. In practice a number of standardised systems have
been developed: Audio, Video and audiovisual systems
Domestic Digital Bus (hereinafter referred to as D2B)
defined by the so-called publication 1030 of the IEC, the
Home Bus System (hereinafter referred to as HBS) defined by
the ET-2101 of the EIAJ, and the like. Through the
bi-directional bus, other devices are controlled from
equipments (devices), e.g., a television image receiver, a
video tape recorder, and a video deck player (hereinafter
respectively referred to as TV, VTR, VDP), etc., or
sub-devices, e.g., a monitor image receiver (TV monitor), a
TV tuner, a video deck, or an amplifier, etc. included in 
other devices are controlled from devices. Further, data
for displaying, on a TV monitor, e.g., the operating state
(status) of device or sub-device is transmitted through the
bi- directional bus. In addition, as an access system of
the bi-directional bus, so called CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is employed in,
e.g., D2B.Inter alia, the following may be carried out using
the bi-directional bus: communication from a sub-device
included in a device to a sub-device included in any other
device (hereinafter referred to as communication from
sub-device to sub-device), communication from a sub-device
included in a device to any other device (hereinafter
referred to communication from sub-device to device),
communication from a device to a sub-device included in any
other device (hereinafter communication from device to
sub-device), and
