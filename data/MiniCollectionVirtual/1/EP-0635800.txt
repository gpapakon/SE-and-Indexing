<ABSTRACT>
System for the transfer of data relating to vehicles (4, 4'), comprising 
vehicle units (1, 1') disposed in vehicles (4, 4'), a central unit (3), and at least 

one intermediate unit (2), which intermediate unit is equipped for at least the 
temporary storage of data, the system being equipped for the transfer of data 

between the vehicle units (1, 1') and the intermediate unit (2), on the one 
hand, and between the central unit (3) and the intermediate unit (2), on the 

other hand, the system further being equipped for the remote transfer of data 
by means of infrared light between the vehicle units (1, 1') and the intermediate 

unit (2). The vehicle unit (1) of a vehicle (4) is advantageously 
situated inside the vehicle (4) behind a window of said vehicle, which window 

is preferably the windscreen (5). The intermediate unit is preferably 
equipped for the storage of data from several vehicles (4, 4').

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for the transfer of data relating to 
vehicles, comprising vehicle units disposed in vehicles, a central unit, and at 
least one intermediate unit, which intermediate unit is equipped for at least 
the temporary storage of data, the system being equipped for the transfer of 
data between the vehicle units and the intermediate unit, on the one hand, 
and between the central unit and the intermediate unit, on the other hand, 
and the system further being equipped for the transfer of data by means of 
infrared light between the vehicle units and the intermediate unit. The 
invention also relates to an intermediate unit for use in such a system. A system of the type mentioned in the preamble, and also an 
intermediate unit for use therein, is known from German Patent Application 
DE-A-4,118,486 [1]. In the known system the vehicle unit accommodated in a vehicle is a 
board computer which stores data relating to the respective vehicle. These 
data are transferred by means of an intermediate unit to a central unit such as 
a personal computer, where the data can be processed. For this purpose, the 
known intermediate unit is shaped like a diskette. For the exchange of data 
with this diskette-shaped intermediate unit, both the central unit and the 
vehicle unit are provided with a reading unit, into which said diskette-shaped 
intermediate unit can be inserted. When inserted, the intermediate unit can 
communicate with the respective reading unit, for example by means of 
infrared light. Such a diskette-shaped intermediate unit, which for the transfer of 
data must be inserted into the reader of the central unit or vehicle unit, has  
 
the disadvantage that data can be exchanged with a vehicle unit only if the 
intermediate unit is in the vehicle. The vehicle data can thus be checked only 
by someone who has access to the vehicle concerned, or who can open the 
vehicle. The known system also has the disadvantage that the transfer of 
vehicle data by always inserting and removing the intermediate unit is 
relatively time-consuming. If data have to be read out from a fairly large 
number of vehicles or have to be put into a fairly large number of vehicles, 
the transfer time required is considerable. French Patent Application FR-A-2.667.554 [2] discloses an anti-theft 
system for vehicles. Vehicle identification data are transmitted from a vehicle 
unit to an apparatus in which the vehicle data are compared with stored data 
of missing vehicles. The apparatus receiving the

System for the transfer of data relating to vehicles (4,4'), 
comprising vehicle units (1, 1') disposed in vehicles (4,4'), a central unit (3), 

and at least one intermediate unit (2), which intermediate unit (2) is equipped 
for at least temporarily storing data, the system being equipped for the 

transfer of data between the vehicle units (1,1') and the intermediate unit (2), 
on the one hand, and between the central unit (3) and the intermediate unit 

(2), on the other hand, and the system further being equipped for the transfer 
of data by means of infrared light between the vehicle units (1,1') and the 

intermediate unit (2), characterized in that the system is equipped for the 
remote bidirectional transfer of data between the vehicle units (1,1') and the 

at least one intermediate unit (2), the intermediate unit (2) being equipped 
for the storage of data from several vehicles (4,4'). 
System according to claim 1, the system being equipped for the 
remote bidirectional transfer of data between the central unit (3) and the at 

least one intermediate unit (2). 
System according to claim 1 or 2, in which a vehicle unit (1) is 
situated inside a vehicle (4) behind a window of said vehicle, which window is 

preferably the windscreen (5). 
System according to any of the preceding claims, in which the 
vehicle units (1,1') are arranged to prevent the manual input of data. 
System according to any of the preceding claims, in which the 
transfer of data between a vehicle unit (1) and an intermediate unit (2) is 

possible only if said transfer includes a password which is unique for the 
particular vehicle unit (1). 
System according to claim 5, in which the vehicle units (1, 1') are 
arranged for replacing the password by a new password, the vehicle data 

 
stored in the vehicle unit being erased if the new password is transferred 

without the existing password. 
System according to any of the preceding claims, equipped for 
data transfer in data blocks and for recording the number of data blocks transmitted, 

in order to ensure that after an interruption in the data transfer retransmission 
of data blocks already transmitted does not occur. 
System according to any of the preceding claims, in which the 
vehicle units (1, 1') are equipped for the storage of data relating to the 

opening of the doors and tailboard, the running of the engine, the mileage, 
the speed and the level in the fuel tank of the respective vehicle (4; 4'). 
System according to any of the preceding claims, in which the 
vehicle units (1, 1') are equipped for the storage of data relating to the 

current geographic position of the respective vehicle (4; 4'), the central unit 
(3) preferably being linked to a data processing unit (6) which is capable of 

graphically presenting, inter alia, the journeys covered by the vehicles (4, 4'). 
Intermediate unit (2) for use in a system according to any of the 
preceding claims, comprising a control unit (21), a memory (22) for the 

storage of vehicle data, a user interface (23) comprising a keyboard for 
entering instructions, and means (24, 25) for the remote transfer of vehicle 

information, said means (24, 25) comprising a transmitter for the transfer of 
the vehicle data to a vehicle unit (1) and/or to a central unit (3) and a receiver 

for receiving data.

according to any of claims 1 through 9, comprising a transmitter (101), a 
receiver (102), a time-delay circuit (105, 106, 107, 108) for delaying the 

receiving signal, and a combination circuit (110) for combining the 
transmitting signal and the receiving signal in such a way that the receiving 

signal is suppressed during the transmission and for a short time thereafter.
