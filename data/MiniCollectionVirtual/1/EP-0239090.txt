<ABSTRACT>
A process and a composition for preparing chlorinated 
poly(vinyl chloride) alloys containing aromatic 

polycarbonates, ethylene-based functional polymers, and 

impact modifiers is described. The alloys have good 
thermo-mechanical properties such as good dimensional 

stability under heat, good impact resistance, good ductility, 
and the like. Although the percent of chlorine of the 

chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) is 57% or greater by 
weight, the alloys can be melt-processed at relatively low 

temperatures, that is approximately at 230°C or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing thermoplastic alloys 
containing chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) having a chlorine 
content of at least 57% by weight. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to a process for preparing chlorinated PVC containing 
alloys which have low temperature processing properties. It is well known that a chlorinated vinyl polymer 
referred to as chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, hereinafter 
CPVC, has excellent high temperature performance 
characteristics, among other desirable physical properties. 
Typically, commercial CPVC has in excess of about 57 percent 
by weight (% by weight) bound chlorine, and is most 
conveniently prepared by the chlorination of polyvinyl 
chloride as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,996,489; 
3,100,762; 3,334,077; 3,334,078; 3,506,637; 3,534,013; 
3,591,571; 4,049,517; 4,350,798; 4,377,459; 4,412,898; and 
4,459,387 inter alia. The term CPVC is used herein to define a chlorinated 
vinyl chloride polymer having in excess of about 57% by 
weight bound chlorine. Chlorinated PVC (CPVC) has become an important specialty 
polymer due to its relatively low cost, high glass transition 
temperature, high heat distortion temperature, outstanding 
flame and smoke properties, chemical inertness and low 
sensitivity to hydrocarbon feed stock costs. The glass 
transition temperature of CPVC generally increases as the 
percentage of chlorine increases. However, a well known  
 
undesirable characteristic of CPVC resin is that it 
inherently has low impact properties, a characteristic which 
is also common to vinyl chloride homopolymers. Also, as the 
chlorine content increases, the CPVC resin becomes more 
difficult to melt process, and also becomes more brittle. The poor melt processability of CPVC resins is 
exemplified by milling CPVC on a roll mill which results in 
high torque and high temperatures as well as decomposition of 
the CPVC. Softening additives or plasticizers have been 
added to CPVC in order to improve its processability. 
Although its processability is somewhat improved, these 
additives produce undesirable effects. Some of the more 
significant detrimental effects produced by inclusion of 
these softening or plasticizer additives are lower heat 
distortion temperatures, softness and weakness in terms of 
lower tensile strength, and less desirable chemical 
properties than that exhibited by CPVC alone. These negative 
attributes of the additives on CPVC limit usefulness of the 
modified CPVC in the manufacture of
