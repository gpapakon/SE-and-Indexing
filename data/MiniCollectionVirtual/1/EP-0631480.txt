<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a work station and 
more particularly to a work station which provides an 
operator with a comfortable work environment while 
providing viewing access to a video monitor or the like. As the use of computers and computer monitors 
increases, it becomes increasingly necessary to provide 
the operators with private or semi-private work stations 
in which the operator is provided with a desk and a 
monitor used alone or in conjunction with a computer. These types of work stations often involve 
modular units in order to locate as many operators as 
possible in a given office space to maximize space usage. 
However with operators spending more and more time at work 
stations of the above type, their comfort is compromised 
due to inadequate ergonomics. For example, when a 
computer monitor is involved in the work station, most 
modular work station designs position the operator in 
direct alignment with the monitor. However, when the 
operator wishes to engage in activities other than monitor 
viewing such as paper work or reading, the space 
available for these activities is often inadequate. Other problems with conventional modular work 
stations is that they often cannot accommodate additional 
personnel, are not flexible enough to adopt to different 
environments and do not present a finished, professional 
appearance. Further, these conventional work stations are 
not designed to cover or house the clutter caused by the 
wiring and cables required for the computer, the monitor 
and other associated electronic equipment.  
 The United States Patent US-A-4,852,500 discloses an 
integrated computer work area having a rail located in a 
wall panel for supporting an articulating arm which carries 
a video terminal. Another rail is provided for supporting 
one or more work surfaces, which can be moved laterally 
along the rail and rotate about a vertical axis with 
respect thereto. Concealed wiring cases contain 
communication wiring between a central processing unit 
mounted in the wall panel and the video terminal through 
the articulating arm. Similar cases are provided for the 
wiring of keyboards, printers, disc drives and other 
related equipment. The United States Patent US-A-5,092,253 discloses modular 
furniture adapted to create work stations in open office 
spaces. Each modular furniture includes a work surface, 
privacy screens and means for mounting overhead cabinets. 
The individually styled furniture units can be arranged 
with respect to one another to form
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A work station comprising: 

wall means (10, 12) defining a work area and at least 
one work surface module (14) disposed adjacent said 

wall means (10, 12); 
support means (32) within said wall means (10, 12) for 
pivotal movement of a video monitor (30a) about a 

vertical axis to adjust the angular position of the 
monitor (30a) relative to said work surface module 

(14);
 
characterized in that 
said wall means includes at least two walls (10, 12) 
extending in a perpendicular relationship; 
a plurality of work surface modules (14) extend along 
one (10) of said walls to form a continuous work 

surface; 
at least one additional work surface module (16) is provided to 
extend along the other (12) of said perpendicular 

walls (10, 12) with a corner module (18) extending 
between the additional module (16) and an end module 

of the work surface modules (14) making up the 
continuous work surface; 
an opening (10a) is formed through at least said one 
(10) of said walls in a predetermined relationship 

with said work surface modules (14);  
 
housing means (50) are provided for receiving said 
video monitor (30a) within said opening (10a) in said 

at least one wall (10), said housing means (50) 
pivotally mounted to said support means (32) to allow 

said pivotal movement of said monitor (30a). 
The work station of Claim 1, further comprising means 
(24, 26) for raising and lowering said work surface 

module (16) to adjust its height relative to said wall 
(12). 
The work station of Claim 2, wherein said raising and 
lowering means comprises a pedestal (22) extending 

from the floor of said work area, a piston (26) 
mounted for telescoping movement within said pedestal 

(22) and engaging the lower surface of said work 
surface module (16), and means for axially moving said 

piston (26) relative to said pedestal (22). 
The work station of Claim 1, wherein the outer 
dimensions of said monitor (30a) are less than the 

dimensions of said opening (10a) and further 
comprising covering means (54) extending around at 

least a portion of said monitor (30a) for covering 
said opening (10a) when said monitor is centered 

therein. 
The work station of Claim 4, wherein said covering 
means (54) defines a handle engageable by an operator 

to pivot said housing (50) about said vertical axis. 
The work station of any one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
further comprising means (38) for adjusting the height 

of said housing means (50) relative to said work 
surface module (14).  

 
The work station of any one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
wherein said work surface module comprises an upper 

surface defining a work surface, one straight side 
porti
on (14a) for facing said wall means (10), two 
spaced straight end portions (14b, 14c) each extending 

at an angle to said straight side portion (14a) and a 
curved side portion opposite said straight side 

portion (14a) and extending between said end portions 
(14b, 14c), said curved side portion including a 

relatively gradual curved portion (14d) extending from 
one end portion, and a relatively abrupt curved 

portion (14e) extending from said gradual portion to 
said other end portion. 
The work station of Claim 7, further comprising means 
(22) extending from the lower surface of said module 

(14) for supporting said module in an elevated 
position, said supporting means extending between said 

end portions (14b, 14c) and between said straight side 
portion (14a) and said gradual curved portion (14c). 
The work station of Claim 7, wherein said abrupt 
curved portion (14e) is in a plane passing through 

said vertical axis and extending perpendicular to said 
wall (10). 
The work station of any one of the Claims 1 to 9, 
further comprising receiving means (56a) in said wall 

means (10) for receiving wires and cables from said 
video monitor (30a) and from any electronic components 

on said work surface module (14). 
The work station of Claim 10, wherein said receiving 
means comprises a raceway (56a) and a cover for said  

 
raceway, said cover having openings for said wires and 

cables.
