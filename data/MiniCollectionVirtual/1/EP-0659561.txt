<ABSTRACT>
A thermal ink-jet head of the present invention is so
designed as to improve operating frequency by surely trapping

foreign substances and reducing the influence of a cross
stroke. In the thermal ink-jet head of the present invention,

a channel wafer (11) is provided with a nozzle channel (5), a coupling
flow channel (6), and an ink reservoir (7). A protective layer (10) and a

polyamide layer (9) are formed on a heater wafer (8). The polyamide
layer (9) is provided with pits (2) extending from a heating element (1) up

to the coupling flow channel (6) and a bypass pit (4) for coupling the
ink reservoir (7) and the coupling flow channel (6). Foreign

substances (11) are trapped at the entry port of the bypass pit (4) and
the entry port of the coupling flow channel (6). The pit (2) controls

the growth of the bubble by eating away the front end of the
heating element (1) and reducing its rear end. Moreover, the

polyamide wall (3) at the end of the pit (2) is made semicircular to
suppress the propagation of the pressure toward the coupling

flow channel (6) and to reduce the cross stroke by means of the
coupling flow channel (6). The channel pressure wall (12) at the end of

the nozzle channel (5) is used to reduce the flow channel
resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal ink-jet head
which produces air bubbles in ink by using of heat generated by
a resistive element for producing bubbles and jets the ink from
nozzles by means of the air bubbles thus produced so as to
execute recordings, and more specifically, relates to an ink
flow channel structure in the thermal ink-jet head.For example, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No.
Sho. 61-230954 discloses the flow channel structure of a known
thermal ink-jet head which includes a first Si-substrate
(heater substrate) and a second Si-substrate (channel
substrate) in which a heating element is formed in the first
Si-substrate, whereas nozzles and an ink reservoir are formed
in the second Si-substrate by using ODE (anisotropic etching).In the case of a thermal ink-jet head as disclosed in
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei. 1-148560, the
method of forming nozzles includes the steps of preparing a
nozzle unit and an ink reservoir in the form of independent
grooves to ensure that the length of each nozzle is made
controllable, and coupling them via a recess (a bypass)
provided in the polyamide layer of the first Si-substrate. The
ink flow channel of the thermal ink-jet head thus formed tends
to allow the impurities contained in ink to gather in the 
bypass because the bypass is narrow and curved. The problem in
this case is that the nozzles are easily prevented from being
supplied with ink. The foreign substances gathered in the
bypass impair the supply of ink to the nozzles and deteriorates
the repeat jet characteristics of the nozzles, thus making a
jet drop smaller or otherwise rendering ink jet completely
impossible. These malfunctions results in lowering image
quality. On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to
prevent such foreign substances from mixing with ink or
slipping into the head during the process of manufacture; in
other words, some foreign substances are unavoidably mixed
therewith.In order to prevent image quality from deteriorating
because of foreign substance, for example, Unexamined Japanese
Patent Publication No. Hei. 5-124206 has proposed to narrow an
entry port of each individual ink flow channel so as to trap
such foreign substances and provide a common ink flow channel
to supply ink flow channel instead of relying on the ink flow
channels clogged with foreign substances. Further, Unexamined
Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei. 4-351842 has proposed to
provide a common slit in a polyamide layer so as to supply ink
from the common slit when
