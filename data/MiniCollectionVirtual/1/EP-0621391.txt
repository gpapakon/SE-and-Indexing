<ABSTRACT>
The venetian blind (3) having a plurality of shutter-forming slats (7) and an end rail (63) is guided in lateral vertical guides (5) in a window opening. In each vertical guide (5), a sliding body (35) is guided, suspended on a pulling-up strip (11), with a pivot lever (37). When the shutter is lowered and pulled up, the pivot lever (37) bears on the driver (41) at the end of the pulling-up strip (11). If the end rail (63) meets with an obstacle or if the end rail (63) is raised in unauthorised fashion, then the end rail (63) is lifted in the sliding body (35) and, at the same time, the driver (41) is released from the pulling-up strip (11), and the pivot lever (37) is pivoted by the end-rail carrier (61) such that it catches in the vertical guide (5).

A Venetian blind with several slats forming a
hanging whose ends are guided in vertical guides

at the sides and whose bottom slat or end rail is
carried in two sliding bodies mounted displaceably

in the vertical guides in such a way that they are
suspended on lifting strips running in the

vertical guides at the sides, and with clamping
elements attached to the displaceable sliding

bodies in the vertical guides so they can swivel
and arranged so they can be swivelled by raising

the bottom slat or end rail and so they can be
clamped in the vertical guide, characterized in

that

each clamping element (37) is designed as a two-armed
swiveling lever (37) mounted so it can

rotate about a pin (39), with its first arm (67)
designed and suitable for coming in frictionally

engaged contact with the vertical guide (5) by
rotation, and its second arm (65) designed and

suitable for being entrained by the end rail
carrier (61) in the sliding body (35) and pivoted

about the pin (39) when the end rail (63) is
lifted and pressing the first arm (67) against the

vertical guide (5), and
an entraining element (41) is arranged at the
lower end of each lifting strip (11), and its

hook-shaped part (47) engages in a recess (34) in
the sliding body (35) and carries the sliding body

(35) in raising and lowering the Venetian blind
(3).
A Venetian blind according to claim 1, characterized
in that the ends of the end rail carrier (61)

are held and guided in indentations (59) that run
vertically in the sliding bodies (35) and are open 

at the top.
A Venetian blind according to one of claims 1 or
2, characterized in that the first arm (67) of the

swiveling lever (37) intended for pivoting into
contact with the vertical guide (5) is longer than

the second arm (65), and/or the first arm (67) is
heavier than the second arm (65).
A Venetian blind according to claim 3, characterized
in that means are provided on the sliding

body (35) for limiting the swiveling movement of
the swiveling lever (37).
A Venetian blind according to claim 4, characterized
in that the end (69) of the swiveling lever

(37) is cropped as a means of limiting the
swiveling movement, and it is intended for coming

to rest against a shoulder (70) on the sliding
body (35).
A Venetian blind according to one of claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the end of the second arm

(65) of the swiveling lever (37) comes to lie over
the indentation (59).
