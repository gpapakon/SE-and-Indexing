<ABSTRACT>
The moth-repelling composition of the invention utilizes a clove-tree 
leaf essential oil coming from Madagascar in association with citronella 

oil from Java, Patchouly 35501, lavender extract from Marseille, 
lavender extract from Apt, and lavender extract from Vaucluse, as well 

as fixolide and benzyl salicylate as preservative agents and various 
other components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid composition having a
moth-repelling effect, wherein the composition is based
on natural components having no harmful influence on
human body and whose moth-repelling effect is more
extended in time.In particular, the composition according to the
invention makes use of the following substances as its
active components:
essential oil of Clove-tree leaf from Madagascar,citronella oil from Java,Patchouly 35501,lavender extract from Marseille,lavender extract from Aptlavender extract from Vaucluse; as well as benzyl
salicylate and fixolide, these latter acting as
preservatives for the product to keep effectiveness of
the product over a longer period of time.The composition according to the invention falls within
the class of products having a repelling effect on
moths, that is products capable of giving off vapours
over a certain period of time which are moth-repellent
due to their being highly irritant to these insects.These products can act, as the case may be, by 
evaporation or sublimation of the substances composing
the moth-repelling preparation, which in turn, can be
from either a natural or synthetic source. In the case of
synthetic products, the vapours they give off are
usually toxic to moths which generally die when in a
space full of the vapours, for example,
inside a wardrobe.However, this toxicity also affects, though to a very
lower extent, human beings who inhale said vapours, for
example, when staying in a room where the wardrobe is
placed.Natural compositions with low or no toxicity are also
known.Examples of products of this type presently in use are
citronella, lavender, or clove oil used either
individually or in combination.These compositions have, however, not found widespread
acceptance hitherto in that these natural products have
in general relatively poor and/or very short
effectiveness, so that it is necessary to use the
product in more concentrated form and/or to replace it
frequently which is not cost effective.In view of the above, a need has been felt in this
connection for a product which has good moth-repelling
property while maintaining its effectiveness over 
longer periods of time , and which is non-toxic to the
human body.These objectives are attained with the composition
according to this invention which is the result of many
thorough experiments by the applicant and whose
features are as defined in the characterizing parts of
the annexed claims.The moth-repelling composition of the invention utilizes
a clove-tree leaf essential oil
