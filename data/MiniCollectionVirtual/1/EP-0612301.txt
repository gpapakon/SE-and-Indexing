Apparatus for transporting and/or storing piece goods, 
comprising a web of foil or fabric material, which can be folded together 

and which is folded together to form at least one substantially U-shaped 
pocket (1) in which the piece goods can be accommodated, and a suspension 

means at the upper end of the pockets, which suspension means can be 
suspended on at least one suspension arrangement fixed to a main 

structure (6), wherein the suspension means is a support bar (4) which 
can be connected to the upper end of the pocket preferably by way of a 

loop and which extends in the transverse direction over the width of the 
pocket (1) and whose ends can be suspended at oppositely disposed 

suspension points, characterised in that the apparatus has a loading 
frame which is pivotably and selectively releasably mounted either to the 

lower end or to the upper end of the main structure (6) and which has 
devices (35, 36) for receiving the support bars (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that there is 
provided at least one loop (3) at the upper end of the limbs of the U-shape 

of the pocket (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in that the loops 
are formed by the connection of the limbs of the U-shapes of adjacent 

pockets (1). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that in the transverse direction of the pocket (1) a plurality of loops 

(3) are provided in mutually displaced relationship at oppositely 
disposed limbs of the U-shape of a pocket (1). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the support bar (4) which extends in the transverse direction over 

the width of the pockets (1) can be passed through the upper end of the 
loop.  

 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that the suspension points are arranged at two parallel rails (5) which 

can be secured to the main structure (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 6 characterised in that the rails 
(5) have retaining locations as suspension points. 
Apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in that 
the rails are C-shaped in profile with C-limbs which converge towards 

each other. 
Apparatus according to claim 8 characterised in that the rails 
(5), at least in the vicinity of their ends, have a locking means which 

at least partially closes the C-shaped cross-section. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or one of the claims appendant 
to claim 5 characterised in that the support bars (4) have a thickened 

end or a constriction at a short spacing from their end or rollers (7) 
arranged at the ends with axes parallel to the support bar (4). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in 
that the main structure is a truck body structure. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in 
that the main structure (6) is a frame which substantially defines a 

cuboid with two rails (6) extending in the vicinity of the top side of 
the frame parallel on opposite sides. 
Apparatus according to claim 12 characterised in that the frame 
is open at at least one end. 
Apparatus according to claim 12 or claim 13 characterised in 
that the frame is open at its top side.  

 
Apparatus according to one of claims 12 to 14 characterised in 
that the frame (6) is collapsible. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in 
that the successive pockets are folded together in a substantially zigzag 

configuration. 
Apparatus according to claim 16 characterised in that at the 
end of the first or last pocket (1) the web has a projecting free end 

whose length is such that after being folded back it covers the top side 
of the row of pockets. 
Apparatus according to claim 16 or claim 17 characterised in 
that there are provided clips (8) which embrace the loops (3) with the 

inserted support bar (4). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 18 characterised in 
that the lateral openings of the pockets (1) are closed by preferably 

removable folding sheets (9). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 19 characterised in 
that smaller additional pockets (1') are arranged at the walls of the 

pockets (1). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that the suspension means is in the form of a coathanger whose lower bar 

is in the form of the support bar which extends through the loops (3). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or one of the claims appendant 
to claim 5 characterised in that the substantially rectangular loading 

frame (30) is hingedly mounted at the lower end of the end part of the 
main structure (6) and at its upper end has devices (35, 36) for 

receiving the support bars (4).  
 
Apparatus according to claim 22 characterised in that the 
loading frame (30) has profile rails (35) which extend substantial
ly in a 
vertical direction and which correspond to the profile rails (5) of the 

main structure (6), wherein provided on the main structure (6) is a 
locking device which can be released by pivoting the loading frame (30) 

towards the main structure and which in the locked condition prevents the 
support bars (4) from being moved out at the end. 
A method of loading and unloading an apparatus with a main 
structure with two parallel rails (5) on which are held the ends of 

support bars (4) which carry substantially U-shaped pockets, according to 
claim 5 or one of the claims appended to claim 5, characterised in that: 


a) for unloading
 
a loading frame (30) is pivotably mounted to the upper end of 

the main structure (6) and the support bars with the pockets 
(1) hanging thereon are successively transferred into profile 

rails of the upwardly pivoted loading frame, which profile 
rails align with the rails of the main frame, and the support 

bars are emptied, and 
b) for loading
 
the pockets (1) which are suspended on the support bars and 

which lie on the profile rails of the loading frame are filled 
with articles and transferred into the main structure from the 

upwardly pivoted loading frame which is mounted to the upper 
end of the main structure (6).
