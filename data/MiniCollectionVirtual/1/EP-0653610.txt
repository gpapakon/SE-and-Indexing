<ABSTRACT>
A water meter housing (3) has two mutually telescoped 
parts (4, 5) which fit an aperture in a wall, the parts 

being adjusted to the thickness. On the outside there is a 
cover (8) and on the inside a cowl and cover assembly (11, 

12) housing an upstream stop valve (22) and a downstream 
valve system (27, 30, 32) which allows through flow or 

selective drainage. Between these there is coupled a water 
meter (16,51) which is within the housing (3) or the cowl 

and cover assembly (11, 12) and readable from the exterior. 
The stop valve (22) is operable either by a consumer within 

the building, or by an authorised person through the housing 
(3). The drain valve system has similar dual operation, the 

drain (33) to within the housing being for test purposes. 
The housing (3) may contain insulation (9, 34, 47) and one 

block (34) of this may be lockable in place and thereby deny 
access to the stop valve (22) and the drain valve system 

(27, 30, 32) through the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water meter housings. We already manufacture and sell a self-contained 
boundary box combining a stop cock and a water meter which 
is designed to be sunk into the ground at the boundary of a 
property to allow metering of the water supply into the 
property and also to allow isolation of the supply. Whilst 
this design has been extremely successful there are drawbacks 
associated with this system as the meter is not 
readily accessible to the occupier of the property to allow 
him to read the meter. In this specification, the terms 
"interior" and "exterior" are used to differentiate between 
the different sides of a boundary wall in a house, flat, 
commercial or industrial premises or other dwelling or 
industrial commercial unit, and do not limit the invention 
to use on an exterior wall. According to the present invention there is provided a 
housing assembly for a water meter, the assembly having a 
housing adapted to be installed in the wall of a building 
and having at its interior end a mounting for a meter 
readable through the housing from the exterior, the supply 
to and the delivery from the meter being on the interior of 
the wall. Preferably, the mounting includes a manifold which 
provides a coupling for a meter to the supply and the 
delivery. Meters may be supplied separately, by the local 
Water Undertaking for example, but the housing assembly can 
be put in place and used before metering is required or  
 
wanted. There will therefore be available blanking means 
which can be substituted for a meter and attached to the 
manifold to permit full unmetered flow, restricted flow, or 
no flow at all. Generally there will be a stop valve in the supply and 
it may be operable both from within the housing and from the 
inside of the building. There will also preferably be drain 
valve means in the delivery, and those may be operable from 
within the housing to drain therein and from the inside of 
the building to drain on that side. When operated from 
within the housing, these valve means may isolate the 
delivery and direct all supply water to the drain within the 
housing. The housing drain facility is provided primarily to 
enable tests to be made by the Water Undertaking, for 
example on meter accuracy, water quality and pressure. 
Suitable test apparatus is connected to the housing drain 
and water diverted to it. Further advisable components will be a check valve 
downstream of the meter position to prevent reverse flow 
from the delivery, and a filter

<CLAIMS>
A housing assembly for a water meter, the assembly 
having a housing (4, 5) adapted to be installed in the wall 

(1, 2) of a building and having at its interior end a 
mounting (1, 52) for a meter (16, 51) readable through the 

housing from the exterior, the supply (24) to and the 
delivery (29) from the meter being on the interior of the 

wall. 
A housing assembly as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the mounting includes a manifold (17) 

which provides a coupling for a meter (16) to the supply and 
the delivery. 
A housing assembly as claimed in Claim 2, and 
including blanking means which can be substituted for a 

meter and attached to the manifold (17) to permit full 
unmetered flow, restricted flow or no flow at all. 
A housing assembly as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised by a stop valve (22) in the supply operable 

both from within the housing and from the inside of the 
building. 
A housing assembly as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised by drain valve means (30, 32) in the 

delivery, operable from within the housing (4, 5)to drain 
therein and from the inside of the building to drain on that 

side. 
A housing assembly as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterised in that the drain valve means (32) is adapted, 

 
when operated from within the housing, to isolate the 

delivery and to direct all supply water to the drain (33) 
within the housing. 
A housing assembly as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the housing has two mutually 

telescoped parts (4, 5) whose overlap is sealed (6) according 
to the wall thickness, and in that at the exterior end 

of the housing there is a closable cover (8). 
A housing assembly as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the interior end of the housing 

is spanned by a cowl (11, 52) to the interior side of which 
is fitted a cover (12, 57) forming a chamber in which 

connections to the supply and delivery are concealed. 
A housing assembly as claimed in Claim 8, as 
appendant to Claims 4 and 5, characterised in that the cowl 

(11, 52) and cover (12, 57) provide access to operating 
members (25, 26) of the stop valve (22) and drain valve 

means (30, 32) within said chamber, and openings for the 
associated drain outlets (31, 33). 
A housing assembly as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the housing (4, 5) is substantially 

filled, apart from any meter therein, with insulating 
material(9, 34, 47) including a block (34) which can be 

locked in place, thereby denying access to the stop valve 
(22) and the drain valve means (32) from within the housing, 

the (34) block having a passage through which a meter can 
be read from the exterior on removal of an insulating plug 

(47) which may be provided for this passage.
