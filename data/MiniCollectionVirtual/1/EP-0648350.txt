<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing top anti-reflective coating compositions for 
photoresists, which coating compositions have a very low 
level of metal ions, especially sodium and iron, and for 
using such top anti-reflective coating composition with 
light-sensitive photoresist compositions to produce 
semiconductor devices. Further, the present invention 
relates to a process for coating substrates already coated 
with a photoresist composition with these top 
anti-reflective coating compositions, as well as the 
process of coating, imaging and developing light-sensitive 
photoresist compositions coated with such anti-reflective 
coatings on such substrates. Thin film interference plays a central role in the 
process control of optical microlithography. Small 
variations in the thickness of resist or of thin films 
underneath the resist cause large exposure variations, 
which in turn cause two classes of undesirable line width 
variations. 
1. As thin film thickness may vary from run to run, 
wafer to wafer, or across a wafer, line widths 
will vary from run to run, wafer to wafer or 
across a wafer. 2. As patterning takes place over wafer topography, 
the resist thickness unavoidably changes at the 
topography edge causing the line width to vary as 
it crosses the edge.  
Avoiding such thin film interference effects is one of the 
key advantages of advanced processes such as X-Ray 
lithography or multi-layer resist systems. However, Single 
Layer Resist (SLR) processes dominate semiconductor 
manufacturing lines because of the their simplicity and  
 
cost-effectiveness, and also because of the relative 
cleanliness of wet developed processes compared with dry 
processes. Thin film interference results in periodic undulations 
in a plot of the exposure dose required to clear positive 
photoresist (termed dose-to-clear) versus the photoresist 
thickness. Optically, on a resist-coated substrate, light 
reflected from the bottom mirror (due to the effect of the 
substrate + thin films) interferes with the refection of 
the top mirror (the resist/air interface). As optical lithography pushes towards shorter 
wavelengths, thin film interference effects become 
increasingly important. More severe swings in intensity 
are seen as wavelength decreases. One strategy for reducing thin film interference is to 
reduce the substrate reflectivity through the use of 
absorptive Anti-Reflective Coats. One way of doing this is 
to apply a Top Anti-Reflective coating on top of the 
photoresist
