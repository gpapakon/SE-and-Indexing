<ABSTRACT>
Gas turbine system (50) incorporates an improved combustion system 
(52) having no control linkage, but instead, a pneumatically actuatable 

valve (58) that is mounted within a housing (56). Housing (56) does not 
have a plurality of holes formed therein for admitting a mechanical 

linkage, as does the housing in a conventional gas turbine system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a system and
a method for controlling the combustion process in a continuous-type
fuel combustion system. More specifically,
this invention relates an improved system for regulating
the air/fuel ratio in a gas combustion-type turbine system.Gas combustion-type turbine systems like those
manufactured by the assignee of this invention, Westing-house
Electric Company, are in common use for power generation
purposes throughout the world.A conventional gas turbine combustion system 10 is
depicted in Figure 1. In such a conventional system 10, a
compressor fan 14 forces intake air into a chamber 16.
System 10 further includes a plurality of combustion baskets
18, each of which have a combustion chamber 20 that is
separated into primary and secondary combustion chambers.
Each basket 18 is communicated, by known structure and
controls, with a fuel supply 22 for supplying fuel to
combustion chamber 20, as well as a number of fixed nozzles
24 for admitting pressurized fuel into combustion chamber
20.To optimize the efficiency of system 10, and to
keep the combustion process as clean and pollutant-free as
possible, turbine system 10 includes a system 28 for
regulating the air/fuel mixture that is provided to combustion
chamber 20. As will be seen in Figure 1, each
basket 18 includes a transition piece 46 that defines a
transition passage 44 between the combustion chamber 20 and 
a turbine intake area 48. The turbine intake area 48 is
characterized by the stationary vane 11 that is shown in
Figure 1. As is also shown in Figure 1, a butterfly valve
42 is provided for admitting pressurized air from chamber
16 to the transition piece 46, well downstream of the
combustion chamber 20. When butterfly valve 42 is open,
pressurized air bypasses chamber 16, thereby reducing the
amount of air that is forced into the inlets 24 of combustion
chamber 20. Accordingly, by opening butterfly valve
42, the air/fuel ratio in combustion chamber 20 is reduced.
By closing butterfly valve 42, conversely, the air/fuel
ratio in combustion chamber 20 can be increased.A mechanical control linkage 40 is provided in
conventional system 10 for opening and closing butterfly
valve 42. As may be seen in Figure 1, an external rotating
ring 30 is provided outside housing 12 for movement on
bearings 32. Each butterfly valve 42 is coupled to a
control rod 31 that passes through a hole in housing 12.
One tie rod 34 is secured to external sliding ring 30. A
second tie rod 38 is secured to a top end of control rod
31.

<CLAIMS>
A combustion system that is constructed and arranged to
be used with a power-generating turbine or the like, comprising

:

at least one combustion chamber (20);
fuel supply means (22) for supplying fuel to said at
least one combustion chamber;
air supply means (26) for supplying air from a pressurized
air source to said at least one combustion chamber

characterized by means for biasing said piston in one of

said first or second positions.
The system according to claim 4, wherein said
piston includes a passageway which interconnects said inlet

and said outlet when said piston is positioned in said
first position.
A system according to claim 4, wherein said
biasing means (78) biases said piston toward said first

valve position.
A system according to claim 4, wherein said
biasing means comprises a spring (78).
A system according to claim 7, wherein said
spring comprises a compression spring (78).
A system according to claim 7, wherein said
spring comprises a tension spring (102).
