<ABSTRACT>
For generating sound from a percussion instrument, a linear extended body which is clamped on both sides, is tensioned and is held so as to be capable of oscillation and has the form of a cord, cable, wire or Bowden cable (12) or the like is struck with a baton (16) or drum stick to generate an oscillation pulse and the mechanical vibration which is generated is picked up by means of a movement sensor (13), for example a trigger microphone known per se, which is arranged on the clamp or on the linear extended body, and is converted into an electrical decaying oscillation which is fed to a computer (14) which is connected downstream and determines the actual sound behaviour by adjustment, and is amplified for reproduction via earphones or loudspeakers (17).
