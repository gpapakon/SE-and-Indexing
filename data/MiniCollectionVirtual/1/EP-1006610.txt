<ABSTRACT>
A radio wave absorbent which comprises, as a main
component, a manganese-nickel-copper-zinc system ferrite

comprising 2.0 to 14.5 mol% of nickel oxide, 3.5 to 17.0
mol% of copper oxide, 30.0 to 33.0 mol% of zinc oxide, 0.5

to 10.0 mol% of manganese oxide, and 40.0 to 50.5 mol% of
iron oxide. By virtue of the above-mentioned composition,

the radio wave absorbent of the present invention is
advantageous not only in that the reflectivity in a wide

frequency band of from a low frequency is -20 dB or less,
but also in that the matching thickness is small, thus

enabling lowering of the production cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio wave
absorbent for use in an anechoic chamber, a radio wave
absorptive wall and the like, which is composed of a
nickel-zinc system ferrite.Recently, with the progress of information
communication technique or the prevalence of various
electric apparatus, the influence of unnecessary
electromagnetic noises exerted onto precision apparatus
associated devices has posed problems. For the measurement
of electromagnetic noises, an anechoic chamber where there
is no reflection of electromagnetic waves is used, and a
radio wave absorbent is used in the inner wall of the
anechoic chamber. Moreover, in order to prevent a
reception trouble caused by the reflection of television
waves by high-rise buildings and the like, the radio wave
absorbent is used in the outer wall of a building and the
like. In addition, a large amount of such a radio wave
absorbent is used in the inner wall of an anechoic chamber,
the outer wall of a building and the like. Therefore,
there has been a demand for the reduction of the production
cost for the radio wave absorbent.As a conventional radio wave absorbent, for
example, use is made of a radio wave absorbent having
characteristics such that a reflectivity in a frequency 
band of 40 MHz to 450 MHz is -20 dB or less. As such a
radio wave absorbent, for example, a radio wave absorbent
obtained by sintering a magnesium-zinc system ferrite
material (Japanese Patent Publication Nos.
01072925 and 01301524 and the
like), and a radio wave absorbent obtained by sintering a
nickel-zinc system ferrite material (Japanese Patent Publication No.
2794293, Japanese Patent Publication Nos.
05129123, 03200303 and 06084622
and the like) are exemplified.The cost for a raw material used for producing a
magnesium-zinc system ferrite material is relatively low.However, this ferrite material needs to be sintered at a
temperature as high as 1,250Â°C or more, and hence, there
has been a problem in that a high-temperature sintering
furnace especial for this magnesium-zinc system ferrite
material is required. Further, the matching thickness of
the radio wave absorbent obtained by sintering the
magnesium-zinc system ferrite material is as large as about
8 mm. Therefore, when such a radio wave absorbent is used
in the inner wall of an anechoic chamber, the outer wall of
a building and the like, the reduction of the total weight
of the radio wave absorbent used is inevitably limited.On the other hand, each of Japanese Patent Publication No.
