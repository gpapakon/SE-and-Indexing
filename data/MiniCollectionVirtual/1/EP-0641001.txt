<ABSTRACT>
The switch has a vacuum switching tube (1) and a switch housing (3) which holds the vacuum switching tube (1) between two electrical connections (5, 6). The vacuum switching tube (1) contains an evacuated housing (7) which is constructed in the form of a tube and has a stationary switching element and a moving switching element. A contact support (8) (which can be moved by a drive) of the moving switching element is guided out of the housing (7), held in a vacuum-tight manner by means of a bellows (19) and held on the tube axis (2) by means of a sliding guide. The sliding guide has a bush (12) which is detachably mounted on a flange (16) of the housing (7). The bush (12) has an axially aligned guide groove (22) located on its inner surface. A guide element (14), which is held on the sliding body of the moving contact support (8), is guided in this guide groove (22). The switch is distinguished by the fact that undesirable forces acting axially, radially or in a twisting manner are kept remote from the bellows during assembly (installation) and during operation. In consequence, vacuum sealing of the vacuum switching tube (1) and thus good operational realiability (safety) of the switch are ensured even over long operating time periods and during assembly (installation) and maintenance (servicing) tasks.
