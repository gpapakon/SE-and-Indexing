<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet printing apparatus is constructed to 
have one or more kinds of sloth printing modes and 

to select the cloth printing mode. In the cloth 
printing mode, at least one of printing condition is 

differentiated from the printing condition for other 
media. Also, by permitting various setting for the 

ink ejection amount and ejection method in the cloth 
printing mode, fine and precise textile printing can 

be performed by normal ink-jet printer in personal 
use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printer and a printing
system which is capable of printing on a common paper and on
cloth.EP 0 558 236 A2 discloses an ink jet textile printing apparatus
for performing the recording by reading an original image
created by a designer, converting the original image into
original data represented by an electric signal, retrieving
the original data for the processing to be output as image
data and recording data on the cloths based on the image
data. The ink jet textile printing apparatus has a first ink
jet recording head provided upstream of the recording area,
and a second ink jet recording head provided downstream
thereof, and is provided with a drying unit between both recording
heads, whereby high-quality recorded image with less
bleeding can be obtained by recording on said recording area
again with the second ink jet recording head after drying a
recording area on the cloths recorded by the first ink jet
recording head with the drying unit.EP 0 317 140 discloses an ink jet recording method characterized
by thinning print dots and printing them when recording
a printing mode or a character having many print dots. Associating with spreading of information
processing apparatus, such as copy machines,
wordprocessors, computers and so forth and
communication apparatus, an ink-jet type printing
apparatus are spread as one of apparatus for
outputting images processed by the systems set forth
above. This type of printing apparatus employs an
ink-jet head for forming ink dot on a printing
medium to perform digital printing. Many of such
apparatus has a printing mode for performing
printing employing a transparent sheet with an ink
receptacle layer, i.e. so-called OHP sheet as the
printing medium. In this mode, in comparison with 
printing on the common paper, with respect to a
black ink, for example, twice greater amount is
ejected toward the OHP sheet.On the other hand, a dedicated ink-jet textile
printing apparatus have been put into practical use.
In such textile printing apparatus, it becomes
possible to produce high precision and high density
printing clothes employing dedicated ink-jet
recording heads specifically adapted for the textile
printing. However, this kind of ink-jet textile
printing apparatus are all adapted for industrial
application and not for the personal use to permit
the user for easily printing. For instance,
Japanese Patent Application Laying-open No.
55277/1986 discloses an ink-jet textile printing
apparatus dedicated for industrial textile

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printing system employing an ink-jet head and
performing printing by ejecting an ink to a printing medium

from said ink-jet head while the ink-jet head and the printing
medium are relatively moved, characterized by comprising


setting means for setting a printing mode by selecting
one printing mode from a plurality of printing modes including

a cloth printing mode for performing printing on a cloth
and a plurality of printing modes for performing printing on

a plurality of kinds of printing medium other than the cloth,
respectively,
printing control means for performing printing operation
for the printing medium corresponding to the printing mode

set by said setting means, wherein in said cloth printing
mode, an amount of ink to be ejected to a unit area of said

cloth is greater than the amount of ink to be ejected to the
unit area of the printing medium other than the cloth in any

of said plurality of printing modes, and
means for automatically increasing the distance between
said ink-jet head and said printing medium, when a printing

mode for performing printing on a cloth is set.
An ink-jet printing system as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that said printing control means operates said

ink-jet head to reciprocally scan on the printing medium so
that the ink is ejected in both of forward and reverse scanning

in said cloth printing mode and so that ink is ejected
at either of forward and reverse scanning cycle.
An ink-jet printing system as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that said printing control means performs printing
