<ABSTRACT>
A device for trimming the edge of a lawn device 
comprises a rotary cutter which, in use, rotates about an 

axis which is substantially horizontal with respect to the 
ground. The device further comprises a guide (14) which is 

mounted to extend, in use, in a substantially vertical 
downward direction to a depth greater than or substantially 

equal to the depth to which the rotary cutter extends. 
The guide (14) is preferably mounted to extend, in use, in a 
substantially vertical downward direction to a depth greater 

than or substantially equal to the depth to which the rotary 
cutter extends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for trimming 
the edge of a lawn, which device comprises a rotary cutter 
which, in use, rotates about an axis which is substantially 
horizontal with respect to the ground. It has particular 
relevance to devices which trim by means of a filament or 
strip that is rotated rapidly about a substantially 
horizontal axis; such devices may be adjustable between two 
alternative modes of cutting, in one of which the filament 
is rotated about a substantially horizontal axis, which mode 
is particularly adapted for edging, and a second mode in 
which the filament is rotated about a substantially vertical 
axis, which mode is particularly adapted for general 
vegetation cutting. It is a disadvantage of known devices for trimming the 
edge of a lawn that it is difficult for the user to line up 
the trimmer with the lawn edge, and to maintain this 
alignment during trimming. Various proposals have been 
made to provide guide means to overcome this difficulty, but 
none of these have proved completely satisfactory. It is a 
further disadvantage of edge trimmers of the rotating line 
type, that excessive line wear and breakage may result from 
the impact of the line against the base of shallow edges. In devices of the type which are adjustable between the 
two alternative modes of cutting, as discussed above, there 
is a further problem in that the edging guide must not 
interfere with efficient cutting performance in the general 
cutting mode, when the line is rotating about a vertical 
axis, especially when the device is being used for trimming 
close to an obstacle such as a tree or a wall.  It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
device for trimming the edge of a lawn in which the above 
disadvantages are reduced or substantially obviated. The present invention provides a device for trimming 
the edge of a lawn, which device comprises a rotary cutter 
which, in use, rotates about an axis which is substantially 
horizontal with respect to the ground, characterised in that 
the device further comprises a guide which is mounted to 
extend, in use, in a substantially vertical downward 
direction to a depth greater than or substantially equal to 
the depth to which the rotary cutter extends. The present invention further provides a device for 
trimming the edge of a lawn, which device comprises a 
cutting line which, in use, rotates about an axis which is 
substantially horizontal with respect to the ground, 
characterised in that the device further
