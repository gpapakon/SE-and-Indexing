<ABSTRACT>
A fluid dampened support for a bearing such as a tilt pad bearing or a rolling element (13) bearing such as a ball bearing, needle bearing, roller bearing and the like. The fluid dampened support (20) includes a network of closely spaced beams (24, 26, 28), which act as structural springs which support the outer race of the roller bearing for movement in any direction. The spring rate or constant of these structural springs can be caused to change after a selected amount of deflection. The amount of deflection needed to cause the change in spring rate can be adjusted to suit the particular application. A liquid is provided in the spaces between the beams (24, 26, 28) to dampen movement of the pads. The damping rate can be made to change with movement of the pads (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bearings and, 
more particularly, fluid dampened rolling element bearings 
and tilt pad bearings. Rolling element bearings such as ball, roller 
and needle bearings are used in almost every kind of 
machine and device with rotating parts. They are currently 
the most widely used bearing. Rolling element bearings typically include four 
parts: an inner ring, an outer ring, the balls or rollers 
and a cage or separator for separating the balls from one 
another. The balls in ball bearings are normally made of 
high carbon chromium steel. The balls are heat treated to 
high strength and hardness and the surfaces are ground 
and polished. Cylindrical roller bearings are usually 
made of case hardened steel. Rolling element bearings are made in a wide 
variety of types and sizes. Regardless of their size or 
shape, rolling element bearings operate on the same basic 
principle of allowing low friction rotation of one member 
relative to the other while maintaining solid metal-to-metal 
contact between the two elements. For a rotating shaft, relative rotation between 
shaft and bearing is usually prevented by mounting the 
inner ring with a press fit and securing it with a nut 
threaded on the shaft. Excessive interference of metal 
must be avoided in press-fits, or the stretching of the 
inner ring may decrease the small but necessary internal 
looseness of the bearing. Conventionally, rolling element bearings are 
mounted to a fixed housing so that because there is little 
radial play. Although the outer ring, when the shaft 
rotates, is mounted more loosely than the inner ring,  
 
rotational creep between the ring and the housing should 
be prevented. Compared to other bearings such as conventional 
journal bearings, rolling element bearings offer a number 
of advantages. These include low starting friction; the 
ability to support loads inclined at any angle in the 
transverse plane; the ability to support thrust components 
of loads; and low maintenance cost. In addition 
the bearings are easily replaced when worn out and 
require less axial space than for journal bearings. There are, however, certain disadvantages associated 
with conventional rolling element bearing assemblies. 
The cost is typically higher, more radial space 
is generally required than with journal bearings and more 
noise is generated by ball bearings, especially after 
wear. In addition, rolling element bearings are more 
subject to fatigue failure and are more easily damaged by 
foreign matter. All
