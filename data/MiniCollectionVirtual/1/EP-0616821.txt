<ABSTRACT>
A process for extracting fragrant, flavoursome or 
pharmacologically active components from natural 

materials using non-chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents. 
The process enables the more volatile components of 

plant derived materials, which are frequently lost in 
conventional methods of extraction, to be extracted. 

This results in the extracted components bearing a 
greater similarity to, and possessing a larger number 

of the characteristics of the original material than 
conventionally obtained extracts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
method for the extraction, concentration and
preservation of fragrances and flavours from natural
materials. Natural materials with which the present
invention is concerned include: flowers, seeds, bark,
buds, roots, leaves, fungal mycelia, moulds, algae and
lichens.For many generations man has sought to obtain and
preserve the essential ingredients of natural products
(buds, roots and leaves, but other flavoursome and
fragrant natural materials may be successfully
extracted) which are responsible for their
characteristic aroma, fragrance, flavour and
pharmacological properties. The motivation for
obtaining those essential fragrances arose for many
different reasons; for example, ancient civilisations
used special fragrances for religious ceremonies.
Later, fragrances found application in personal and
domestic hygiene.Many plants have been used as sources of
pharmacologically active preparations for example
antibiotics and there is considerable and growing
demand for an even more diverse range of plant extracts
of high quality and integrity. The widespread use of
flavouring to improve taste and smell of foods has been
long appreciated, whilst being somewhat limited by the
confines of available technology.One reason for the deterioration of concentrated
fragrances over time is their volatility. The
transmission of volatile fragrant molecules through the
air from their source to the recipient's nose allows
the recipient to perceive a scent. Similarly, their
capture by the palate is perceived as a flavour.
Hence, loss of volatile fragrant components from an
aromatic oil greatly reduces its quality. Drying was probably the earliest attempt to
preserve aromas and flavours so that they were
available all the year round. Some fragrances and
flavours can be preserved well by drying. Many seeds
for example dry naturally whilst preserving much of
their fragrance and flavour. However, some of the most
precious aromatic materials in plants are actually
gases at room temperature and pressure, for example the
compounds responsible for the lachrymatory components
of horse radish and onion and the aroma of freshly
ground roasted coffee beans. Most of the other
delicate components of a natural flavour or fragrance
are highly volatile liquids, and many of these
materials are more volatile (having a higher vapour
pressure) than water hence they evaporate faster than
water. Consequently, whilst drying might be a valuable
way of conserving the aroma in some plant products (for

A process for extracting one or more components from
material of natural origin, but not including a process for

removing oil from ready-to-eat potato-based and cereal-based
products which have accumulated oil in a cooking process

thereof, the process comprising the steps of:

a) contacting the material with a non-chlorinated
tetrafluoroethane solvent so as to charge the solvent with

the component;
b) collecting the charged solvent; and
c) removing the solvent to isolate the component.
A process for extracting one or more fragrant or flavour
or pharmacologically active components from material of

natural origin, the process comprising the steps of:

a) contacting the material with a non-chlorinated
tetrafluoroethane solvent so as to charge the solvent with

the component;
b) collecting the charged solvent; and
c) removing the solvent to isolate the component.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
process comprises extraction of a flavour or fragrance from a

natural material, the process comprising the steps of:

a) contacting a natural material with said non-chlorinated
tetrafluoroethane solvent so as to charge the solvent with a

flavour or fragrance;
b) collecting the charged solvent; and
c) removing the solvent to isolate the flavour or fragrance.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein a
flavour is isolated in step c).
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein a

fragrance is isolated in step c). 
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein said
solvent has a boiling point of -26Â°C at atmospheric pressure.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
material is contacted with the solvent in an extraction

vessel after the vessel has been sealed and air has been
removed, and wherein the mixture of the solvent and the

material is maintained under pressure so that the material
and the solvent are in intimate contact and the solvent is

charged with the component.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
solvent is at ambient temperature when in contact with the

material.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
solvent is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
material of natural origin is selected from plants, flowers,

herbage, bulbs, seeds and vegetables.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
material of natural origin is selected from flowers, bulbs,

corms, moulds, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, herbs, seeds,
bark and buds.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the
material of natural origin is plant material.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 9 or 12,
wherein the material of natural origin comprises flowers.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 9 or 12,
wherein the material of natural origin comprises herbs. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
pressure in the extraction vessel is not more than 40 mbar

after the air has been removed and before the solvent has
been introduced.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
material is contacted with the solvent in an extractor, and

wherein the extractor communicates with a source of the
solvent to supply solvent to the extractor and with an

evaporator to remove the solvent from the charged solvent in
order to isolate the component.
A process as claimed in claim 16, wherein the evaporator
communicates with a compressor which supplies liquefied

solvent to the solvent source and/or the extractor.
A process as claimed in claim 16 or 17, wherein the
evaporator includes a source of heat for controlling the

temperature of the evaporator.
A process as claimed in claim 18, wherein the source of
heat is thermostatically controlled to maintain the

temperature of the evaporator.
