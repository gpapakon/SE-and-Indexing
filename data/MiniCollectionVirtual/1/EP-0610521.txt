<ABSTRACT>
Hazardous wastes in a liquid, paste-like or solid state, which may contain heavy metals, are disposed of by being subjected, in a first stage in a pyrolysis furnace, to pyrolysis, after which the pyrolysis gases are introduced directly into a cement kiln during the primary firing. This achieves the destruction, at the temperatures of far above 1300@C in the cement kiln, of all organic compounds which can be hazardous to the environment or to health. In a particular embodiment, products such as plastics which contain heavy metal compounds are disposed of, with the pyrolysis taking place in the presence of a compound such as sulphur, selenium or tellurium. The heavy metal here remains very largely in the pyrolysis furnace as residue.
