<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a material 
removal process and system, and more particularly, to a 
material removal process and system controlled by 
spectral emissions obtained by irradiating the material 
with a pulsed light. Material coatings play an important role in 
our manufactured products based society. Coatings 
provide immunity to corrosion, thermal insulation, 
shielding, as well as appearance enhancement, and an aid 
in identification. During the life of many manufactured products, 
such as bridges, aircraft, automobiles, and ships, 
painted coatings require removal and replacement for a 
variety of reasons. For example, refurbishment of the 
paint on aircraft is a regular maintenance item. 
Commercial airlines repaint their aircraft about every 4-5 
years of service. The United States military typically 
repaints its aircraft after three years of service, or 
less. Coatings on the exterior surfaces of large ships 
or bridges require periodic refurbishment in order to 
prevent or inhibit corrosion. The removal of paint from the surfaces of 
aircraft presents special problems. Such surfaces are 
large, irregularly shaped, and relatively delicate. 
Because the surfaces of aircraft are typically 
lightweight aluminum or organically based composite 
materials, such surfaces and the underlying substrates 
are particularly susceptible to damage while undergoing 
paint removal that could degrade their structural 
integrity.  
 Many different methods have been used to remove 
painted coatings. One type, the "particle medium blast" 
(PMB) method involves impinging the surface to be 
stripped with particles such as BB's, plastic media, 
steel shot, wheat starch, and/or sand. However, PMB 
methods energetic enough by themselves to remove hardened 
coatings such as paint may damage delicate surfaces such 
as found on aircraft and automobiles if they are not 
carefully managed. For example, if the impinging 
particles dwell too long at one location, the impinged 
surface may become pitted or stress hardened. This is 
especially important with regard to the surfaces of 
aircraft since pitting or stress hardening may change the 
loading on that portion of the aircraft. PMB may also 
damage putty joints often found on aircraft between 
surface plates. It is also known in the art to apply chemical 
compounds to painted surfaces in order to chemically 
breakdown the layers of paint, thereby stripping the 
paint away from the surface to be exposed. However, such 
compounds may pose a risk to human health,

A system for removing material from a

a structure (14) at a target area, said light beam 
having an intensity sufficient to ablate said surface 

material;
 
   a laser source (10) generating a pulsed, 

coherent laser beam (12') at a time inbetween pulses of 
said incoherent light beam (549

irradiating said target area of said structure (14), 

said laser beam (12') having an intensity sufficient to
