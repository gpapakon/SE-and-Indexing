<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for cleaning stainless steel or aluminum 
shutter members (2) in a blanked and generally U-shaped form as 

they are fed continuously comprises a guide rail (3) for 
guiding the shutter members (2) so that they are transferred in 

a specified direction and a plurality of cleaning nozzles (23) 
through which a cleaning solution (5) is sprayed onto the 

shutter members (2). A plurality of vessels (6A, 6B, 6C) for 
supplying the cleaning solution (5) to the cleaning nozzles 

(23) are provided along the guide rail (3) and the cleaning 
solution (5) overflowing a supply vessel (6) downstream of the 

guide rail (3) is allowed to flow into sequentially upstream 
supply vessels (6) via flow lines. The cleaning solution (5) 

is recovered from the most upstream supply vessel (6C) and, 
after the cleaning debris is separated out, the cleaning 

solution (5) is supplied into the most downstream supply vessel 
(6A). The apparatus enables efficient cleaning of the shutter 

members (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
cleaning members of interest and, more specifically, to a 
method and apparatus that are suitable for cleaning 
stainless steel, aluminum or other metallic shutter members 
in a blanked and generally U-shaped form as they are fed 
continuously. Hard case housings such as containers of recording 
media are usually fitted with shutter members for opening 
and closing the slot through which the recording head is to 
be pushed in. Such shutter members are typically made of 
stainless steel or aluminum and they are bent in a 
generally U-shape that is slidably mounted over opposite 
sides of the container. The shutter member also has a 
window which, when in registry with the slot for head 
insertion, permits the head on the recording apparatus to 
be pushed in. To fabricate such shutter members from 
stainless steel, the metal sheet is blanked in a 
predetermined shape which is then bent in a generally U-shape.  A working oil is used in the blanking step of the 
process for fabricating shutter members and unless it is 
removed almost completely before the shutter member is 
mounted on the container, various troubles may occur. 
Hence, it is common practice to remove the working oil from 
the shutter member by either cleaning it with a detergent 
or rinsing it. In the conventional methods of cleaning shutter 
members, the rinsing liquid, detergent and other cleaning 
media must be used in such large volumes that the treatment 
of effluents that contain the working oil can cause serious 
environmental problems. At the same time, recycling of the 
working oil and other valuables is desirable. Further, to 
conveyorize their cleaning operation, shutter members may 
be transferred as they are held by suitable supports and 
other tools while they are cleaned with a spray of cleaning 
solution. A problem with this approach is that if holding 
members or the like are used as the support for 
transferring shutter members, the holding part will prevent 
thorough cleaning of the latter. In addition, if slender 
guide rails or the like are simply used to hold the shutter 
members in the process of their transfer, the inner 
surfaces of the shutter members cannot be fully cleaned 
and, what is more, erratic transfer of the shutter members 
will prevent their positive and consistent cleaning.  An object, therefore, of the present invention is to 
provide a method that is capable of cleaning members of 
interest in a positive and effective manner and which gives 
due

<CLAIMS>
A method of supplying a cleaning solution to an 
apparatus in which a plurality of members are transferred 

continuously in a specified direction as the plurality of 
members are cleaned with the cleaning solution that is 

supplied through a plurality of cleaning nozzles provided 
side by side in said specified direction, said plurality of 

nozzles being divided into at least two groups, a first 
group of said at least two group of nozzles being arranged
