<ABSTRACT>
In a position measuring device (1) according to Figure 1, a number of division tracks (3a, 3b) are provided on a material measure (3). The division track (3b) which, because the material measure (3) is attached to the support body (2) in the area B is only accessible at its surface, is scanned by a scanning device (4) by reflected light. The freely accessible area A of the material measure (3), in contrast, is scanned by transmitted light by the scanning device (4).

<CLAIMS>
Position measuring device (1) having at least one
material measure (3) which is secured with a

portion of its flat surface area lying on a
carrying body (2) and has on its flat surface area

a plurality of division tracks (3a, 3b), with
which scanning devices (4) are associated,


characterised in that
 at least the division tracks
(3b) which are disposed on the freely accessible

side of the material measure (3), opposite the
area (B) lying flat on the carrying body (2), are

scanned by the associated scanning device (4), all
the elements of the scanning device (4) which are

necessary for scanning being disposed on the one
freely accessible side of the material measure

(3), and in that the division tracks (3a) which
are disposed in the free area (A), not lying on

the carrying body, of the material measure (3) are

scanned by the associated scanning device (4), the
elements of the scanning device (4) which are

necessary for scanning being disposed on both
sides of the material measure (3).
Position measuring device according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the material measure (3)
consists of transparent material, especially

glass.
Position measuring device according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the division tracks (3b)
opposite the area (B) lying on the carrying body

(2) have optically readable marks which are
scanned by means of the reflected light method.
Position measuring device according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the division tracks (3a) in 
the free area (A) of the material measure (3) have

optically readable marks which are scanned by
means of the transmitted light method.
Position measuring device according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the carrying body (2) is a
hollow profile in which the interior space is

shielded from environmental influences by sealing
elements (7, 8).
Position measuring device according to claim 5,

characterised in that
 that there is disposed in
the hollow profile (2) an additional material

measure (31) which has at least one division track
(31c) which is scanned by the scanning device (4),

all the elements of this scanning device (4) which
are necessary for scanning being disposed on the

side of the additional material measure (31) which
bears the division track (31c).
Position measuring device according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
position measuring device (1) is an incremental

measuring device, and one of the division tracks
is a reference mark track.
Position measuring device according to one of
claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the position
measuring device (1) is a coded measuring device.
Position measuring device according to one of
claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 at least one
material measure is configured as a metal strip.
