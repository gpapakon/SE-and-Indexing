<ABSTRACT>
A method, oven, and device for heating a strip-shaped carrier in an oven, 
which carrier is passed through the oven by a transport device, while the oven is 

displaced in a direction opposed to the transport direction when a malfunction is 
detected in the supply or removal of the strip-shaped carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of heating a strip-shaped carrier in an
oven, which carrier is passed through the oven in a transport direction.The invention further relates to a device for fastening at least one
component on a strip-shaped carrier.Such a method and device are known from the brochure "Surface Mount
Assembly Equipment" from Philips Electronics N.V., of February 1993. A printed
circuit board (the strip-shaped carrier) which is provided with solder and with
components placed on the solder is passed through an oven, so that the solder melts in
the oven and a mechanical connection between the components and the printed circuit
board is formed.If the oven is used for heating a comparatively long strip-shaped carrier,
only a portion of the strip-shaped carrier being present in the oven at any time,
malfunctions such as interruptions or decelerations in the supply or removal of the
remainder of the strip-shaped carrier may take place, whereby the strip-shaped carrier is
not or too slowly transported in the transport direction. As a result, the portion of the
strip-shaped carrier present in the oven remains in the oven too long and is overheated
and damaged. Switching-off of the oven in the case of malfunctions offers no solution
because the oven cools down only slowly.The invention has for its object to provide a method whereby the above
disadvantages are avoided.The method according to the invention is for this purpose characterized in
that the oven is displaced in the transport direction or in a direction opposed to the transport direction when a
malfunction in the supply or delivery of the strip-shaped carrier is detected.In the case of a malfunction, which is detected, for example, by sensors,
the strip-shaped carrier is no longer transported in the transport direction. To prevent
overheating, the oven is displaced in a direction opposed to the transport direction, so
that the portions of the carrier already heated can cool down. In addition, a relative
movement of the strip-shaped carrier against the oven is maintained, so that portions of 
the strip-shaped carrier not yet heated are heated by the oven.An embodiment of the method according to the invention is characterized
in that the oven is displaced in the transport direction after the malfunction.Thus it is possible at a subsequent malfunction for the oven to be
displaced in a direction opposed to the transport direction again, while the distance over
which the oven is displaceable may be comparatively small.Another embodiment of the

<CLAIMS>
A method of heating a strip-shaped carrier (3) in an oven (11), which carrier is
passed through the oven in a transport direction, characterized in that the oven is either

displaced in the transport direction or in a direction opposed to the transport direction (X) when a malfunction in the
supply or delivery of the strip-shaped carrier is detected.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the oven is
displaced in the transport direction after the malfunction.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the strip-shaped
carrier, which is flexible, is guided so as to form a buffer loop situated in front

of or beyond the oven, the oven being displaced in a direction opposed to the transport
direction whenever a malfunction in a buffer loop is detected.
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the oven is
displaced in a direction opposed to the transport direction when it is detected that the

buffer present in front of the oven is full.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that the buffer situated
in front of the oven is filled before the oven is displaced in the transport direction.
A method as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the oven is
displaced in a direction opposed to the transport direction when it is detected that the

buffer situated beyond the oven is full.
A device (1) for fastening at least one component on a strip-shaped carrier (3)
which is passed through said device in a transport direction (X), characterized in that the

device is provided with a component placement mechanism (9) for placing the component
on the strip-shaped carrier, while the device is further provided with an oven and means (27) for

displacing the oven in the transport direction and in a direction opposed thereto, while the
component placement mechanism is situated before the oven seen in the transport

direction.
A device as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that the device is
provided with a test unit for testing an electric circuit on the carrier comprising

components placed on the carrier by the component placement mechanism, which test 
unit is situated beyond the oven seen in the transport direction.
