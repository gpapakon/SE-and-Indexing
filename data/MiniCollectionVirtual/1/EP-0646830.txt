<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal device includes a TFT or active 
element substrate on which TFTs (4) and pixel electrodes 

(3) are arranged in the form of a matrix, a counter 
substrate (2) having a counter electrode (13) formed 

thereon and arranged to oppose the active element 
substrate (1), a polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer 

(20) arranged between the active element substrate (1) 
and the counter substrate (2) and having a polymer resin 

and a liquid crystal which are dispersed, and a 
fluorescent film (12) arranged on the pixel electrode 

(3). The device displays an image by controlling 
scattering, absorption, and transmission of light 

passing through the polymer dispersed liquid crystal 
layer (20). The fluorescent film (12) converts part of 

supplied light into fluorescent light having a 
predetermined wavelength and outputs colored light. 

Light used for a display is increased in intensity by 
the fluorescent light emitted from the fluorescent film 

(12), thereby displaying a bright image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active matrix
liquid crystal display device and, more particularly, to
an active matrix liquid crystal display device which can
provide a bright display.A TN type active matrix liquid crystal display
device comprises: a first substrate on which a plurality
of pixel electrodes and active elements respectively
connected thereto are arranged in the form of a matrix;
a second substrate having a counter electrode opposing
the pixel electrodes; a frame-like seal member for
joining the first and second substrates; a nematic
liquid crystal sealed in a space defined by the first
and second substrates and the seal member; and
polarizing plates arranged to sandwich the first and
second substrates.Aligning films for restricting the aligning direction
of liquid crystal molecules are formed on the surfaces
of the first and second substrates on which the
electrodes are formed. The liquid crystal molecules are
twisted/aligned between the first and second substrates
at a twist angle of almost 90Â°. The pair of polarizing
plates are arranged such that their transmission axes
are almost parallel to each other.In the TN type active matrix liquid crystal display
device, external incident light is linearly polarized by
one of the polarizing plates and incident on the liquid 
crystal layer. Of the light passing through the liquid
crystal layer, only light components parallel to the
transmission axis of the other polarizing plate emerge
therefrom. For this reason, the light amount loss owing
to light absorption in the polarizing plates is large,
resulting in a dark screen.This problem is especially conspicuous in a reflection
liquid crystal display device having a reflecting
plate arranged on the rear side of the device. More
specifically, the reflection liquid crystal display
device performs a display operation by using natural
light or indoor illumination light. That is, the device
is designed to use weak light. In addition, light incident
on the upper surface side of the liquid crystal
display device passes through each of the pair of
polarizing plates twice until the light is reflected by
the reflecting plate and emerges from the upper surface
side. For this reason, the loss of light is large. As
a result, the screen becomes extremely dark.In a transmission liquid crystal display device
used with a backlight arranged on the lower surface
side, light incident on the lower surface side passes
through each of a pair of polarizing plates once until
the light emerges from the upper surface
