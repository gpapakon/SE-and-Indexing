<ABSTRACT>
The RF meter reading system includes a transmitter having an 
encoder. Meter data is encoded and modulated using a bi-phase 

modulating scheme. In order to uniquely identify the start of a 
data transmission, a super start field, which is an "illegal" 

bi-phase signal is used. The super start field is selected such 
that it cannot be recognized if transmissions from more than one 

transmitter are being received by the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an automatic 
meter reading system. In particular, the invention relates to a 
system which uses radio frequency (RF) transmitters to send 
encoded meter readings to a receiver which is able to collect 
data from a plurality of such devices. In an automatic meter reading system, of the type used to 
read utility meters, it is desirable to have a system in which a 
meter reader can periodically pass througn an area containing a 
number of meters and collect their data. In the past, systems 
have existed in which the meters included transponder-like 
systems. In a typical system known in the prior art, a mobile 
collector unit, such as a van, would traverse an area collecting 
data from encoder/receiver/transmitter ("ERT") unit. The ERT 
units contained an encoder, a receiver, and a transmitter. The 
radio mounted in the van would transmit a "wake-up" signal which 
served to cause the ERT units in its proximity to send out their 
encoded data. Such a system, due to its inclusion of both a 
transmitter and a receiver, is called a "two-way" system. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a 
simpler, and, thus, less expensive system, in which only the 
encoder and transmitter were located at the site being monitored  
 
would be desireable to minimize costs. However, such a "one-way" 
system would have to include means for conserving battery power, 
means for preventing conflicts in transmissions, and means for a 
receiver/collector unit to identify valid transmissions from 
identifiable locations. The present invention is an RF meter reading system. The 
system comprises an RF transmitter and an encoder means 
associated with the RF transmitter. Data collected by a meter is 
encoded by the encoder. The transmitter also encludes a bi-phase 
modulator which modulates the encoded signal for transmission by 
the RF transmitter. The modulator includes means for generating 
a synch signal, a start signal, a message signal, and a 
verification signal. The start signal is a signal which 
intentionally violates the bi-phase encoding rules, such that it 
may be identified when the receiver portion of the system 
receives the transmitter's signal. The RF meter reading system also includes an RF receiver 
containing means for receiving transmissions from the 
transmitter. The receiver includes means for decoding the 
bi-phase modulated signals and means for identifying the start 
signal. In addition, the receiver includes means for verifying 
receipt of valid data
