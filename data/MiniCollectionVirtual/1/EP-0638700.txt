<ABSTRACT>
The retaining element serves for fastening structural panels, in particular roof or facade panels (11), on load-bearing profiles (12) which consists of sheet steel and are provided with elongate cutouts (15) for receiving the retaining elements. The retaining element comprises a rectangular supporting plate (1) which is provided with a slot (2), consists of spring steel and has two supporting lugs (4) which project on the narrow sides and are supported on the narrow sides of the cutout (15). In order to anchor the retaining element in the load-bearing profile (12), expansion lugs (3) which are pressed resiliently into the cutout (15) are integrally formed on the longitudinal sides of the supporting plate (1), approximately at right angles to the plane of the plate. On the expansion lugs (3) there are located, at a distance from the supporting plate (1), clamping lugs (5) which are bent towards one another on the expansion lugs (3), are directed obliquely with respect to one another and have sharp edges (6) which, when a nail (9) is driven in, are forced apart from one another and thereby press the expansion lugs (3) even more firmly against the longitudinal edges of the cutout (15).
