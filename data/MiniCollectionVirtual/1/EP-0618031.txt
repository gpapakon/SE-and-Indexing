<ABSTRACT>
In a hand-held drilling machine with a combination tool holder for alternatively clamping round-shank or slotted-shank tools, the insertion, the automatic locking and the holding of slotted-shank tools is to be simplified and incorrect operation is to be impossible. The at least one locking body (23, 23') of the tool receptacle (35') for slotted-shank tools (10') is arranged on a guideway (40) which runs at an angle from the rear towards the location bore (9'). The at least one locking body (23, 23') is held at the rear in its locking position by a sliding sleeve (25').

<CLAIMS>
Hand-held drilling machine, in particular a 
hammer drill, having a rotationally drivable tool holder 

which has a basic body (7', 7'') with location bore (9', 
9'') arranged therein for drilling and/or percussion 

tools and which has a jaw chuck (16) for accommodating 
tools having a round shank and a tool carrier (35', 35'') 

separate therefrom for tools having a grooved shank (10', 
10''), the tool carrier (35', 35'') having at least one 

radially displaceable locking body (23, 23', 23'') which, 
in a locking position of the tool carrier (35', 35''), 

engages in an axially closed locking groove (11', 11'') 
of a grooved-shank tool (10', 10'') inserted therein, 

characterized in that the at least one locking body (23, 
23', 23'') is arranged on a guideway (40) which runs 

obliquely from the rear towards the location bore (9', 
9'') and is designed as a bore of approximately circular 

cross-section. 
Tool holder for a hand-held drilling machine, in 
particular for a hammer drill, having a basic body (7', 

7'') with location bore (9', 9'') arranged therein for 
drilling and/or percussion tools, which has a jaw chuck 

(16) for accommodating tools having a round shank and a 
tool carrier (35', 35'') separate therefrom for tools 

having a grooved shank (10', 10''), the tool carrier 
(35', 35'') having at least one radially displaceable 

locking body (23, 23', 23'') which, in a locking position 
of the tool carrier (35', 35''), engages in an axially 

closed locking groove (11', 11'') of a grooved-shank tool 
(10', 10'') inserted therein, characterized in that the  

 
at least one locking body (23, 23', 23'') is arranged on 

a guideway (40) running obliquely from the rear towards 
the location bore (9', 9''). 
Tool holder according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the guideway (40) in the basic body (7', 7'') is 

designed as a bore of approximately circular cross-section. 
Tool holder according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the guideway (40) runs inclined at an angle 

(Î±) of about 30 degrees to an axis (X) of the location 
bore (9', 9''). 
Tool holder according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the at least one locking body (23, 

23', 23'') interacts with a sliding sleeve (25', 25'') 
which is thrust axially forwards in the direction of at 

least one locking body (23, 23', 23'') by a compression 
spring (33', 33''). 
Tool holder according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the sliding sleeve (25', 25'') radially covers 

the at least one locking body (23, 23', 23'') in its 
locking position. 
Tool holder according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the sliding sleeve (25', 25''), for the 

purpose of unlocking the tool carrier (35', 35''), can be 
displaced against the spring force (33', 33'') by means 

of an actuating sleeve (26', 26''). 
Tool holder according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that at least one cylindrical 

locking body (23'') is provided. 
Tool holder according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the at least one cylindrical locking body (23'') 

is rounded off hemispherically on its end facing the 
location bore (9''). 
Tool holder according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that two spherical locking bodies (23, 

23') are provided which are arranged one behind the other 
on the guideway (40).
