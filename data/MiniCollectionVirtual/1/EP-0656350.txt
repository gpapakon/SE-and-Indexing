<ABSTRACT>
Compounds having the formula 

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein X is a single bond, 
O, CO, S, NH or N(lower alkyl); Y is O, S or NCN; and R¹ to R
5'
 are as 
defined herein. These compounds have potassium channel activating 

activity and are useful, therefore for example, as cardiovascular agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to compounds of the formula 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used in formula I, and 
throughout the specification, the symbols have the following meanings:
 
   X is a single bond, O, CO, S, NH or N(lower alkyl);
 
   Y is O, S or NCN;
 
   R¹ is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, (aryl)alkyl, heterocyclo or 
(heterocyclo)alkyl;
 
   R² is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, 
arylalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, -CN, -NO₂, -COR, -COOR, -CONHR, 
-CONR⁶, -CF₃, -S-alkyl, -SOalkyl, -SO₂alkyl, 
halogen, amino, substituted amino, -O-alkyl, -OCF₃, 
-OCH₂CF₃, -OCOalkyl, -OCONRalkyl, -NRCOalkyl, -NRCOOalkyl or 
-NRCONR⁶, where R is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, 
cycloalkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkyl;
 
 
   R³ is hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, -O-alkyl, amino, substituted 
amino, -NHCOR, CN or -NO₂;
 
   R⁴ is aryl, (aryl)alkyl, heterocyclo or (heterocyclo)alkyl;
 
   R⁵ and R5' are hydrogen, alkyl, (alkyl)amino, (alkyl)substituted 
amino or haloalkyl; or
 
   R⁴ and R⁵ taken together with the carbon atoms to which they 
are attached form a 5- to 7-membered ring which can optionally contain a 
O, S or NR⁷;
 
   R⁶ is hydrogen, hydroxy or -OCOR;
 
   R⁷ is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl or 
(cycloalkyl)alkyl; and
 
   n is an integer of 1 to 3; provided that when Y is NCN, R⁴ is 
aryl or (aryl)alkyl and R5' is hydrogen, then R⁵ is other than hydrogen. The compounds of this invention possess antiischemic activity and 
are useful, for example as cardiovascular agents. The present invention provides for compounds of formula I, 
pharmaceutical compositions employing such compounds and for methods 
of using such compounds. Listed below are definitions of various terms 
used to describe the compounds of the instant invention. These definitions 
apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless 
they are otherwise limited in specific instances either individually or as 
part of a larger group. The term "alkyl" refers to both straight and branched chain groups 
having 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the normal chain, preferably 1 to 5 carbons, 
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, the 
various branched chain isomers thereof, such as isopropyl, t-butyl, 
isobutyl, isohexyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, 2,2,4-trimethylpentyl and the like 
as well as such groups including a halo substituent such as CCl₃ or CF₃, 
an alkoxy substituent, an aryl substituent, an alkylaryl substituent, a 
haloaryl substituent, a
