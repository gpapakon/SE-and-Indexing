<DESCRIPTION>
 ARTHROPODICIDAL AND NEMATICIDAL SULFONATESThe compounds of this invention are characterized by having a substituted (R1) (R2)N-C(=X) - or R1-N=c(YR)- moiety located in a 1,3 relationship to an OS02R3 substituent in a heteroaromatic system. U.S. Patent 3,818,102 discloses a certain insecticidal phenyl sulfonate carboxamide. The disclosed carboxamide moiety is unsubstituted and its position is variable relative to the sulfonate moiety.This invention pertains to compounds of Formulae I and II, including all geometric and stereoisomers, agriculturally suitable salts thereof, agricultural compositions containing them and their use for the control of arthropods and nematodes in both agronomic and nonagronomic uses. The compounds areR1 \. N — C — Q R1 — N = C — QR2 'IIwherein :Q is selected from the groupQ-l Q-2
