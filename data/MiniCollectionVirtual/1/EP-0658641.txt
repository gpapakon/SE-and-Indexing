<ABSTRACT>
In a feed-comb arrangement for a combing machine, comprising an intermittently driven pair of feed rollers, preceding the feed-chamber arrangement in the direction of transport of the fibre web to be combed, and a draw-off arrangement, especially in the form of draw-off rollers, following the feed-chamber arrangement, in order to increase the quiet running, avoid accumulations of impurities and achieve efficient transport there is provision for the feed-comb arrangement to be formed by a plurality of needle bars (13) which are intermittently driven synchronously with the comb cycle and are equipped with needles or sawtooth-shaped stampings (14) and which run at their two outer ends in guide tracks (12) in such a way that, over part of the rotational travel, the needles or sawtooth tips (14) engage into the fibre web (2), and, on the other hand, the needles or sawtooth tips (14), after executing a transport movement, emerge upwards out of the fibre web (2).

<CLAIMS>
A feed comb arrangement for a combing machine comprising an intermittently 
driven pair of feed rollers (4) preceding the feed comb arrrangement 

in the transport direction of the fiber web to be combed, and a take-down 
arrangement (7), in particular in the form of take-down rollers, following 

the feed comb arrangement, 
characterized in that
 the feed comb 
arrangement is formed by a plurality of fallers (13), which are intermittently 

driven in sychronization with the combing operation and provided with 
needles or saw-toothed stamped elements (14), respectively, and which at 

their two outer ends, run in closed guideways (12) in such a manner that 
during part of the route of rotation, the needles or saw-toothed tips (14), respectively, 

engage with the fiber web (2) and that on the other hand, after a 
transport motion being covered, the needles or saw-toothed tips (14), respectively, 

leave the fiber web (2) upwardly. 
A feed comb arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
fallers (13) comprise crank projections guided in separate guideways. 
A feed comb arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a 
cleaning means (18) is arranged in the upper region of the guideway (12) of 

the fallers (13). 
A feed comb arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a 
suction means (19) is provided above the cleaning means (18). 
A feed comb arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
drive of the fallers (13) is derived from the drive of the feed rollers (4).
