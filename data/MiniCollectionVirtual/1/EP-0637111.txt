<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor mesa structure (55) including active, 
absorbing, or passive guide layer (54) is surrounded laterally 

by insulating mask (52), and is buried by a cladding layer 
(56) which extends over the insulating mask, and injected 

current flows through the cladding layer into the mesa 
structure without leakage from the cladding layer into a 

substrate so that the semiconductor optical device is 
improved in performance. 

In order to obtain a cladding layer having a flat top surface the 
mesa structure which is selectively grown on a (100)-substrate surface 

obliquely extends at least 5 degrees with respect to [011] direction C 

of the crystal structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor optical 
device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor optical 
device which is fabricated by selective MOVPE technique and 
its fabrication process. In the selective MOVPE, two stripe masks with a 
center spacing is first patterned on a surface of a 
semiconductor substrate. The center spacing is by way of 
example, 2 microns. On the exposed center spacing 
between the stripe is epitaxially grown a semiconductor 
mesa structure including an active layer, a waveguide 
layer or an optical absorbing layer. This selective 
MOVPE technique has better reproducibility in forming mesa 
structure than conventional fabrication technique which 
employs semiconductor etching. The composition of the epitaxially grown 
semiconductor material varies depending on the stripe mask 
width, and this phenomenon is available for changing the  
 
energy band gap in the mesa structure. This technology is 
called as "band-gap controlling technology". The following papers report semiconductor optical 
devices fabricated through the selectively growing 
technique.

Waveguide" reported by Tatsuya SASAKI et al, C-134, 
Proceedings of 1991 Autumn Meeting of Electronic 
Information Communication Society. (2) Japanese Patent Publication of Unexamined 
Application No. 5-37092. (3) "Novel MQW-DFB-LD/ Modulator Integrated Light 
Source" reported by Tomoaki KATO et al, C-133, Proceedings 
of 1991 Autumn Meeting of Electronic Information 
Communication Society. Sasaki et al discloses three-terminal variable 
wavelength DBR laser diodes, and the band-gap controlling 
technology is available for simultaneously growing an 
active layer and a passive waveguide of the three-terminal 
variable wavelength DBR laser diode. The entire surface of 
the structure is covered with a cladding layer. Sasaki et 
al achieved the light output power 15 mill-watt around 1.55 
micron wavelength with the three-terminal variable  
 
wavelength DBR laser diode, and the wavelength was varied 
over 2.2 nano-meter band-width. Kitamura discloses a semiconductor optical amplifier 
or an LD amplifier in Japanese Patent Publication of 
Unexamined Application No. 5-37092, and the selectively 
growing technology is applied to patterning stage of the 
active layer. The active layer is as narrow in width as 
400 nm (4000 angstroms), and is reproducible. Such a narrow active 
layer is hardly patterned through the conventional etching 
process. According to the Japanese Patent
