<ABSTRACT>
An inspection apparatus which automatically 
inspects a bottom border portion of a transparent glass 

vessel for a foreign article accurately is disclosed. 
Light is projected and received by way of first and 

second polarization filters (15, 18) through a rotating 
glass vessel (1) to image the vessel (1) obliquely from 

below by a camera (16) including a plurality of solid 
state image pickup elements. Brightness values of 

outputs of the elements of the camera (16) are compared 
with respective threshold values and are determined as 

abnormality values when they are higher. The threshold 
values are varied and the abnormality values are 

corrected in accordance with the positions of the 
elements of the camera (16), and then presence or 

absence of a foreign article is determined from the 
corrected abnormality values or the sum of them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
inspecting a bottom border portion (a circumferential
corner portion of the bottom and a portion around the
circumferential corner portion) of a transparent glass
vessel to check whether or not a foreign article is
present in the glass material of the bottom border
portion. It is to be noted that, in the present
specification, the terminology "transparent glass
vessel" is intended to include not only literal
transparent glass vessels but also translucent glass
vessels and may be colorless or colored.Apparatus for inspecting a glass vessel for a
foreign article which are used popularly are roughly
divided into two types including an inspection apparatus
which is used to principally inspect a body portion of a
vessel and includes a diffusion light source and a solid 
state image pickup element camera arranged in a
horizontally opposing relationship to each other with a
vessel as an object for inspection interposed between
them and another inspection apparatus which is used to
principally inspect a bottom portion of a vessel and
includes a diffusion light source and a solid state
image pickup element camera arranged in a vertically
opposing relationship to each other with a vessel as an
object for inspection interposed between them (DE-A-3919110).However, it is actually difficult to inspect a
bottom border portion of a glass vessel using an
inspection apparatus of the horizontal arrangement type
since, at a bottom portion of a vessel, the light path
along which light from a light source passes through the
glass material is comparatively long and attenuation of
the light there is so great that, if the bottom portion
is curved, then the light cannot pass through it due to
refraction there.Meanwhile, with an inspection apparatus of the
vertical arrangement type, a bottom portion of a vessel
is imaged by a camera through a mouth portion of the
vessel. However, it is difficult to inspect a bottom
border portion (a bottom circumferential corner portion
and around such portion) due to reflection of light at 
an inner wall face of the vessel or refraction of light
caused by a variation in shape, and particularly for a
vessel having a small mouth, since the field of view of
the camera to the bottom portion of the vessel is
narrowed by the small mouth, a bottom circumferential
corner portion cannot be inspected with the inspection
apparatus of the vertical arrangement type.By the way, cullet (fragments of glass)
collected from the city is recycled as a raw material
for

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for inspecting a bottom border
portion of a transparent glass vessel for a foreign

article, comprising:

rotation means (4) for rotating a transparent
glass vessel (1) around a vertical axis at an inspection

position;
a diffusion light source (10);
a first polarization filter (15) arranged in
front of said diffusion light source (10) and having a

vertical polarization axis for polarizing light from said
diffusion light source (10) and projecting the polarized

light upon the transparent glass vessel (1);
a solid state image pickup element camera (16)
disposed with an angle of depression with respect to the

axis of the transparent glass vessel (1) for imaging a
bottom border portion of the transparent glass vessel

(1) obliquely from below on the opposite side to said
first polarization filter (15) with respect to the

transparent glass vessel (1);
a second polarization filter (18) having a
polarization axis perpendicular to that of said first

polarization filter (15) and arranged for introducing
the light polarized by and transmitted through the 

transparent glass vessel (1) into said solid state image
pickup element camera (16);
image fetching means (19) for fetching outputs
of solid state image pickup elements of said solid state

image pickup element camera (16) at a period conforming
to a speed of rotation of the transparent glass vessel

(1) by said rotation means (4);
storage means (19) for storing the outputs thus
fetched as digital values for at least one rotation of

the transparent glass vessel (1);
abnormal value detection means (19) for
comparing the magnitude of the digital values

with threshold values set for the individual solid state
image pickup elements in accordance with their positions

and determining the numbers of times by which the
threshold values are exceeded as abnormality values;
correction means (19) for multiplying the
abnormality values by correction coefficients determined

in accordance with the positions of the solid state
image pickup elements; and
foreign article presence/absence determination
means (19) for determining presence or absence of a foreign

article in the transparent glass vessel (1) from the
corrected abnormality values.
An apparatus for inspecting a bottom border
portion of a transparent glass vessel for a foreign

article as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that
the angle (Óúç) of depression of said solid state image

pickup element camera (16) is 50 to 60 degrees,
preferably about 55 degrees.
An apparatus for inspecting a bottom border
portion of a transparent glass vessel for a foreign

article as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that
said foreign article presence/absence determination

means (19) sums up the corrected abnormality values
only for a preset inspection area and compares

the sum value with a prescribed value to determine
presence or absence of a foreign article.
