<ABSTRACT>
A disposable undergarment comprises a fibrous 
nonwoven fabric stretchable in length and width, having a 

stretching stress higher than 30 g in width, is used as a 
basic cloth (1). An absorbent pad (10), smaller than the 

basic cloth, is bonded to the inner surface thereof. The 
absorbent pad (10) has a middle zone (S₁) with a higher 

rigidity than opposite side zones (S₂).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable 
undergarment of the pants type formed by bonding front 
and rear bodies along respective opposite side edges at 
waist level, such as incontinence diapers, baby diapers, 
baby training pants and sanitary pants. Such an undergarment of the prior art usually 
employs nonelastic nonwoven fabric as a base cloth, and 
elastic members each comprising a plurality of thread-like 
elastic elements or a single tape-like elastic 
member bonded, after being stretched by a predetermined 
elongation percentage, to respective leg-openings along 
peripheral edges thereof by means of hot melt type 
adhesive in order to keep the leg openings fitting around 
the wearer's legs and thereby to avoid excretion leakage 
possibly occurring around the legs. However, use of said elastic members sometimes 
causes pressure marks around the wearer's legs or even 
causes pain to the wearer. While it may be contemplated, as one measure to 
produce the undergarment at a low cost, to arrange the 
undergarment using none of said elastic members so that  
 
excretion leakage occurring around the wearer's legs may 
be avoided, such an arrangement has not been realized. It is an object of the invention to eliminate the 
abovementioned problems by a novel arrangement of a basic 
cloth and an absorbent element as will be described in 
detail. The object set forth above is achieved, according to 
the invention, by a disposable undergarment comprising a 
basic cloth made of fibrous nonwoven fabric elastically 
stretchable at least in length and width and provided 
with a waist-opening and a pair of leg-openings, wherein 
fibrous nonwoven fabric having a stretching stress of at 
least 30 g, at least in width, is used as said basic 
cloth and an absorbent pad has a smaller size than that 
of said basic cloth so that outer peripheral edges of 
said basic cloth may extend outward from those of said 
absorbent pad and is bonded, preferably intermittently, 
to the inner surface of said basic cloth, and wherein 
said absorbent pad has a rigidity lower than 7 g/cm and 
this rigidity gradually decreases from a longitudinally 
middle zone to longitudinally opposite end zones of said 
absorbent pad. Inspite of the fact that the leg-openings are  
 
not provided with elastic members, peripheral edges of 
the respective leg-openings fit well around the wearer's 
legs. The invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

has a longitudinally middle zone and longitudinally opposite 

side zones and said middle zone has a rigidity higher than 
that in said opposite side zones. 
A disposable undergarment accoring to Claim 1, 
wherein the rigidity of said opposite side zones is 

lower than 7 g/cm. 
A disposable undergarment according to Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said absorbent pad is shaped to have a thickness 

gradually decreasing from a region adjacent its opposite side 
edges to its opposite side edges.
