<ABSTRACT>
The invention is to ensure that in injection molding a
molten resin having carbon dioxide dissolved therein as a

plasticizer, a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide to
achieve satisfactory improvement in flowability is

dissolved in the molten resin so that the flowability of
the molten resin is significantly improved while enabling

the production of a non-foamed molded article.
Specifically, in the invention, a molten resin having
dissolved therein a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide to

improve its flowability is filled into a mold cavity while
allowing to foam at the flow front of the molten resin, and

the resin in the mold cavity is then pressurized to at
least a pressure at which it does not foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of injection
molding of a thermoplastic resin, and more specifically, to
a method of injection molding that provides ease in filling
a mold cavity with a molten resin and which enables
sections of a smaller wall thickness and a longer flow
distance to be filled with a molten resin at a lower
temperature or pressure.The demand for smaller thickness and lighter weight is
not limited to the housings of mobile electronic devices
such as portable computers and cell phones and it has
recently become intensive in the field of general
electronic devices. In particular, the chassis and the
internal mechanistic parts of a copying machine and the
like are required to have not only high dimensional
precision and various kinds of strength associated with
handling but also reduction in thickness and weight. As a
result, injection moldings are needed that desirably have
unequal section thickness, i.e., the portions that do not 
require strength are made thin and lightweight whereas the
portions that require strength are made thick, and which
still have good dimensional precision. In other words, it
is required to meet both requirements for strength and
lightweight by providing a design in which the portions
that require strength are reinforced with thick ribs
whereas the portions that do not require strength are made
as thin as possible. Under these circumstances, a molding
method is needed by which even the sections that are thin-walled
and have long flow distances can be adequately
filled with a resin during molding.In order to ensure that even the sections that are
thin-walled and have long flow distances can be adequately
filled with a resin, one may enhance the flowability of a
molten resin. In injection molding of a thermoplastic
resin, the flowability of a molten resin determines not
only the ease in filling the mold cavity but also the
probability that after filling the cavity, sufficient
pressure is transmitted to its interior, particularly to
the resin which forms the thin-walled portions at the end
of resin flowing; hence, the flowability of a molten resin
also affects the dimensional precision of moldings and is
an important factor that determines the processability of
resins. One index of flowability is the viscosity of a molten
resin. Thermoplastic resins have high melt viscosity and
are poor in flowability as molding materials. Hence, in
the case of thin-walled parts, incomplete resin filling
often occurs.In order to lower the viscosity of a molten resin and
thereby
