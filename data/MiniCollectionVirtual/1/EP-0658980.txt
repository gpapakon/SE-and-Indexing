<ABSTRACT>
A signal-processing circuit for an inductive sensor, which can scan movable parts, is specified in which the coil of the inductive sensor is located in a current mirror circuit and itself is a component of the circuit. The current generated in the coil when the parts to be scanned are passing is directly amplified in the current mirror circuit, the amplified current is evaluated by means of a sensing resistor and an evaluating device, for example for determining the rotational speed of a scanned body.

Signal-conditioning circuit arrangement for a
sensor comprising an inductance, for sensing a movable

part, in particular a rotational speed sensor, the
circuit arrangement comprising the inductance of the

sensor, a first transistor (T1), whose collector is
connected to the base, and a second transistor (T2), the

collectors of the transistors being connected via a
respective resistor (R1, R2) to one another and to a

supply voltage terminal, and the emitters likewise being
connected to one another, and the sensor being connected

between the bases of the transistors, and the second
transistor (T2) effecting current amplification of the

sensor measurement current, characterized in that the
emitters of the transistors (T1, T2) are connected to a

terminal of a resistor (RM) at which a measurement signal
can be picked off.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that two reverse-connected parallel diodes

(D1, D2) are connected in parallel with the inductance of
the sensor.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the inductance

(L1) is a coil, and the coil and the transistor circuit
form a unit.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized
in that a further resistor (R4) is connected

between the base of the second transistor (T2) and the
coil (11), and a resistor (R3) is connected between the

emitter of the first transistor (T1) and the terminal of 
the measuring resistor (RM).
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the inductance

(L1) of the sensor can be influenced by parts (16, 16a,
16b) that are moved past and have a characteristic

surface, with the result that the measurement signal
changes as a function of the surface of the parts moved

past and the speed thereof.
System comprising a circuit arrangement according
to one of the preceding claims, the moveable part (15)

according to Claim 1 and a control device (12), in
particular a control unit of a motor vehicle, the

amplified signal being fed to the control device (12) and
then being evaluated in the control device, the

rotational speed of the sensed part being determined and
the sensed part (15) being a wheel or a rotating shaft.
System according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the control device (12) carries out monitoring of

the level of the signal fed thereto and, in the event of
implausibilities detected in the signal level, detects an

error and initiates a corresponding display.
