<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an apparatus for determination 
of a trace amount of an analyte substance or organism by 

bringing a substrate solution into contact with a small 
diameter tube which has captured, at least on its inner 

surface, a trace amount of an analyte substance or organism 
having an ability to change pH of the substrate solution and 

measuring a pH change following a reaction of a substrate in 
the substrate solution in the small diameter tube, which 

comprises:
 

   a cuvette having an inlet and outlet for the 
substrate solution,

 
   a pH electrode accommodated in the cuvette,

 
   a pumping means for supplying the substrate solution 

in the cuvette,
 

   a positioning means for positioning, in the cuvette, 
the small diameter tube which has captured, at least on its 

inner surface, the analyte substance or organism, to be 
determined, having an ability to change pH of the substrate 

solution so as to confront the inner surface of the small 
diameter tube with the pH sensitive plane of the pH electrode 

and space the surface and the plane at 1 mm or below from each 
other, and

 
   a sealing means for maintaining a space formed by  

 
the outer surface of the small diameter tube accommodated in 

the cuvette and the inner surface of the cuvette at liquid 
tight condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
determination of a trace amount of an analyte substance or
organism. More particularly, the present invention relates
to an apparatus for quantitative determination of a particular
substance or organism contained in a very small amount in the
multicomponent system such as a living body sample, by
utilizing a pH change of a substrate solution resulted from
the physiological activity of an analyte substance or organism
to be determined. The apparatus of the present invention can
be applied to a wide range of fields such as fundamental
medicine, veterinary medicine, biochemistry, pharmacology and
the like in addition to determination of a trace amount of
living body substances in the clinical test.Substances responsible for the physiological
activity of the living body are generally present in a very
small amount and many of them play an important role on the
living body. Since it is therefore important in the organism-related
fields such as medicine, biochemistry and the like to
quantitatively determine a trace amount of physiologically
active substances, a variety of methods have been proposed and 
put to practical use. For example, for determining an enzyme
which is one of the physiologically active substances, there
is generally employed a method of determination by reacting
an enzyme with a corresponding substrate contained in a
substrate solution and measuring a change in the optical
properties of the substrate solution.In addition, since the organism such as cell,
microorganism and the like has also the physiological
activity, it is important in the above organism-related fields
to quantitatively determine the organism such as cell,
microorganism and the like as in the case of the above
physiologically active substances. As examples of the method
for determining a cell among such the organism, there are
frequently employed a method by culturing cells and observing
the cultured cells using an electron microscope, a flow
cytometry method and a rosette method [see "Saibo Meneki Kino
Kensa no Subete (All About Cellular Immunofunction Assay)",
edited by monthly Medical Technology, Ishiyaku Press (1985)].
Recently, a detecting method using a gene has been employed
actively [see, for example, "PCR Jikken Manual (PCR Experimental
Manual)", translated under the supervision of Takashi
Saito, HBJ Press (1991)]. On the other hand, for determining
the microorganism, a detecting method using a gene has
recently been spread in addition to a conventional method by
