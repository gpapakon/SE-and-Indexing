<ABSTRACT>
A helical coil and a top-helical type antenna
using the same, wherein the helical coil has a plurality

of either substantially U-shaped or nearly V-shaped
branch portions made of a thin metallic sheet material.

The branch portions are connected continuously in a
manner to place their open ends alternately inversely,

and the branch portions alternatively curve toward an
obverse side and a reverse side of the metallic sheet to

form each turn of the coil. A method for producing the
helical coil includes continuously die cutting a member

on a belt-shaped strip of electrically conductive
metallic sheet, and alternately placing a plurality of

either substantially U-shaped or substantially V-shaped
branch portions with their open ends inversely. These

substantially U or V-shaped branch portions are then
connected with each other in the shape of a letter, with

connection to the metallic sheet being held only by
linkage portions at opposite sides. The helical coil is

formed by alternately curving the branch portions of each
of the members in a shape of substantially circular arc

toward an obverse side and a reverse side of the metallic
sheet. A bobbin is formed connecting each turn of the

helical coil by either insert-injection molding or
outsert-injection molding of electrically nonconductive

material on the individual helical coil formed on
metallic sheet and subsequently the linkage portions are

sheared off of the metallic sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helical antenna, a
method of producing the same, and a top-helical type
antenna containing a helical antenna for use primarily in
wireless transmission equipment for mobile communication
such as portable telephones and transmitters.Recently, the popularity of mobile communication
devices which utilize wireless transmission equipment,
such as portable telephones, has become widespread. The
wireless transmission equipment for such mobile
communication devices is provided with antennas of various
types for transmitting and receiving radio waves. Some
commonly-used types of antennas include a top-helical type
antenna consisting of a combination of a helical antenna
and a whip antenna. The helical antenna functions when
the whip antenna is retracted within an enclosure of the
transmission equipment, and the whip antenna functions
when the helical antenna is in an extended position,
allowing ease of portability.A retractable antenna comprising a helical antenna at its upper end is described in
JP-A-07-235820. The helical antenna is made of a plurality of metallic coil windings
around in a cylindrical configuration enclosed by a cover. A conductive feeding part
in form of a wire is connected to the lower end of the helical antenna. A top-helical type antenna of a further prior art is
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.Fig. 1 depicts a cross sectional view of a prior art
top-helical type antenna, wherein a helical antenna
element 1 of an electrically conductive metal wire such as
copper and a copper alloy is wound in coil form, a bobbin
2 is made of insulating polymeric resin and a feeding
fixture 3 is made of electrically conductive metal. The
helical antenna element 1 is wound on the bobbin 2 and is 
electrically connected at its lower end to the feeding
fixture 3. A cover of insulating resin encloses helical
antenna 5.Further, a conductor 6 made of electrically
conductive metal is disposed within a resin-insulated tube
7 that forms a sleeve on an outer surface of the conductor
6.Conductor 6 is also electrically connected at a lower
end to stopper 8, also made of electrically conductive
metal, to comprise a whip antenna 9. Helical antenna 5 is
joined at its lower end to the upper end of whip antenna 9
by insulator 10.An antenna holder 11 made of electrically conductive
material is provided with a through hole 11A at its
center, and an outer periphery having threads 11B. The
whip antenna 9 is inserted into the through hole 11A, and
an outer surface of the stopper 8 contacts with an
