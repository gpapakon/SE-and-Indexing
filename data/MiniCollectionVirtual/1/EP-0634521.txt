<ABSTRACT>
In an improved method for bleaching recycled fibres by 
means of hydrogen peroxide, bleaching is performed in the 

presence of ozone or a peracid or salts thereof. While using 
existing apparatus and control equipment, the inventive method 

enables more efficient utilisation of the bleaching capacity 
of hydrogen peroxide than known methods. Recycled fibres can 

thus be bleached to a much higher degree of brightness without 
increasing the amount of hydrogen peroxide, or be bleached to 

the same degree of brightness with a reduced amount of 
hydrogen peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for 
bleaching recycled fibres by means of hydrogen peroxide, 
bleaching being performed in the presence of ozone or a per-acid 
or salts thereof. While using existing apparatus and 
control equipment, the inventive method enables more efficient 
utilisation of the bleaching capacity of hydrogen peroxide 
than prior art methods. With the inventive method, recycled 
fibres can thus be bleached to a much higher degree of 
brightness without increasing the amount of hydrogen peroxide, 
or be bleached to the same degree of brightness with a reduced 
amount of hydrogen peroxide. Before, paper, board and cardboard used to be made from 
virgin fibres, i.e. fibres not previously used in any paper, 
board or cardboard product. As the demand for recycling 
increases, the proportion of recycled fibres in such products 
will gradually be augmented. Since recycled fibres have a 
lower brightness than virgin fibres produced by chemical as 
well as mechanical treatment, this lower brightness will 
determine the maximum brightness obtainable. As a result, 
steps enhancing the brightness of recycled fibres will become 
increasingly important. The deinking and the bleaching of recycled fibres are 
often performed by means of peroxide-containing compounds, 
usually hydrogen peroxide. In defibration, hydrogen peroxide 
is thus used for counteracting the brightness-reducing effect 
of the alkaline aqueous solution and for facilitating the 
separation of printing ink. In addition, hydrogen peroxide is 
often used in one or more plain bleaching stages further on in 
the process for increasing the brightness of the fibres. The prior art encompasses separate use of hydrogen 
peroxide, ozone and per-acids in the processing of waste 
paper. Thus, GB-A-1,564,783 relates to a process for disinfecting 
waste paper in an aqueous hydrogen-peroxide solution 
without any addition of alkali. Further, DE-A-30 01 862 
concerns a process of dry disinfection of waste paper by means 
of ozone, the waste paper being then mixed with water and 
defibrated. US-A-4,548,674 relates to a process for the  
 
regeneration of waste paper containing polymer impurities, in 
particular glue and binders. This process makes it possible to 
avoid such a thing as the formation of glue spots on sheets of 
paper by treating the waste paper with a peracid at an acid 
pH. The invention relates to a method for treating stocks 
containing recycled fibres, according to the appended claims, 
whereby bleaching by
