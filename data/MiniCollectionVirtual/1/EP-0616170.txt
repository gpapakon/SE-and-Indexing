<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for mixing gaseous fuel and air for 
combustion, particularly premixing-type combustion in a 

gas turbine, has a conduit providing a passage for flow 
of the air with a reverse bend (5) defined by opposed 

first and second wall portions (7,10) of bounding 
respectively the outside and the inside of said reverse 

bend as seen in a longitudinal section. The reverse 
bend establishes a flow region of air having a velocity 

gradient extending transversely across the conduit from 
a high velocity zone adjacent the first side wall 

portion (7) at the outside of the reverse bend to a low 

velocity zone. Injection means (8) for the gaseous 
fuel injects the fuel from the first side wall portion 

(7) into the high velocity zone with a velocity 
component transverse to the air flow and in a direction 

towards the low velocity zone. Rapid and uniform 
mixing is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and a
method for mixing gaseous fuel and air for combustion,
and particularly for the mixing of gaseous fuel and air
in a premixing combustion air passage of a combustor of
a gas turbine. While the apparatus and method of the
invention can be applied to mixing of fuel and air for
various purposes, explanation will primarily be made
below in relation to gas turbine combustors or burners.Gas turbine burners which can operate in two
combustion modes have become generally adopted. JP-A-61-22127
(corresponding to US-A-4898001) discloses a
gas turbine burner which employs diffusion combustion
using multiple nozzles and premixing combustion also
using multiple nozzles. Low temperature combustion
using excess air is generally performed, in order to
reduce NOx production. However, an extremely wide
range of fuel supply rate is required from ignition up
to rated load, in gas turbine combustion, making it
impossible to cover this broad range wholly by
premixing combustion. Therefore it is necessary to
employ diffusion combustion over a range of combustion
rate from ignition up to a certain speed of rotation of
the gas turbine or to a certain load level. In 
diffusion combustion, there is a tendency for high
temperature areas to occur locally, leading to a higher
emission level of NOx. Therefore it is desirable to
switch to premixing combustion, giving a uniform and
low temperature combustion with excess air, as soon as
possible in order to reduce NOx. Accordingly, start up
of the gas turbine is effected with diffusion
combustion at the time of ignition, and then the burner
is gradually switched to premixing combustion, with
support from the diffusion combustion flame, when the
ratio of air and fuel reaches the limit for premixing
combustion.Particularly at low fuel supply rates, even in
premixing combustion, low NOx production may not be
achieved at all times. What is required is to achieve
a uniform mixing of the fuel into the premixing
combustion air.JP-A-61-22127 mentioned above describes the
supply of fuel locally into the premixing combustion
air flow through a plurality of nozzles, but it has
been found that concentration distribution of the fuel
in the air is inconsistent, when changes occur in the
volume of air flow or velocity of fuel injection. In
particular, the locus of the injected fuel, after
injection into the air may change considerably, with
change of load. Uneven fuel distribution leads to 
higher NOx production.JP-A-62-294815 shows injection of fuel from a
