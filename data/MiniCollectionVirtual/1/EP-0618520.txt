<ABSTRACT>
In a hobbing machine comprising a bed (1), a first 
movable upright (2) supporting the tool (21) and a 

second upright (3) supporting the blank (31), the 
distance between tool and blank can be adjusted by 

traversing the first upright (2) toward and away 
from the second utilizing a drive (5) interlocked 

to a processing unit (10) in receipt of signals 
from position sensors (6, 8) which are installed at 

different levels (Q, Z) above the bed, in such a 
way as to allow a comparison of linear variations 

in the distance separating the uprights, resulting 
especially from thermal expansion, and thus monitor 

distortion in the machine more accurately.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gear cutting 
machine, and specifically to a gear cutting machine 
incorporating a system for the automatic correction 
of errors caused by dimensional variations deriving 
in particular from thermal expansion. Whilst reference is made in the specification to 
hobbing machines (to be discussed more fully in due 
course), the invention is applicable nonetheless to 
other types of machine using circular or linear 
tools. In a broadly typical embodiment, a hobbing machine 
comprises a substantially parallelepiped bed, and, 
supported in longitudinal alignment by the bed, a 
movable block or first upright, also substantially 
parallelepiped, and a revolving table flanked and 
surmounted by a fixed structure which in practice 
functions as a second upright serving to carry a 
chuck by which the work is clamped. The first upright is mounted slidably to the bed in 
most instances, and will carry a slide or carriage  
 
positioned facing the revolving table and capable 
of movement in a vertical direction. The function 
of the slide is to support the spindle about which 
the tool, in this case a hob, is set in rotation 
and offered to a blank clamped onto the revolving 
table and rotated about a vertical axis. In other embodiments of such machines, it is the 
second upright (carrying the revolving table and 
the work) which slides longitudinally on the base, 
while the first upright remains fixed. Machines of the type in question incorporate one or 
more nozzles, positioned above the area of contact 
between the tool and the blank, from which a stream 
of cutting fluid is directed continuously onto the 
work in such a way as to cool the parts in movement 
and carry away the chips removed from the blank. In the more modern hobbing machines, the combined 
effect of particularly high operating speeds and 
practically non-stop machining (blanks are loaded 
automatically) is that both the parts in movement 
and the slurry of cutting fluid and chips become 
progressively overheated, the heat thus generated 
then being transferred to the area of the machine 
bed between the tool and the work. In the course of 
events, these periods of continuous operation may  
 
be followed by periods of inactivity (for example, 
when changing from one production run to another), 
during which the more exposed upper parts of the 
machine directly involved in the machining process 
(in effect, the uprights) tend to cool, while heat 
accumulated in the bed and the tank is dissipated 
more slowly due

a first axis (A) about which a cutting tool (21) is
