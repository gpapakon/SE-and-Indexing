<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to delivery of biologically active cargo molecules, such as polypeptides and nucleic acids, into the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells (in vitro) and (in vivo) by the use of novel transport polypeptides which comprise one or more portions of HIV tat protein and which are covalently attached to cargo molecules. The transport polypeptides of this invention are characterized by the presence of the tat basic region (amino acids 49-57), the absence of the tat cysteine-rich region (amino acids 22-36) and the absence of the tat exon 2-encoded carboxy-terminal domain (amino acids 73-86) of the naturally-occurring tat protein. The absence of the cysteine-rich region found in conventional tat proteins solves the problems of spurious trans-activation and disulfide aggregation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
copending application Serial No. 07/934,375, filed
August 21, 1992.This invention relates to delivery of
biologically active cargo molecules, such as
polypeptides and nucleic acids, into the cytoplasm and
nuclei of cells in vitro and in vivo. Intracellular
delivery of cargo molecules according to this invention
is accomplished by the use of novel transport
polypeptides which comprise one or more portions of HIV
tat protein and which are covalently attached to cargo
molecules. The transport polypeptides of this
invention are characterized by the presence of the tat
basic region (amino acids 49-57), the absence of the
tat cysteine-rich region (amino acids 22-36) and the
absence of the tat exon 2-encoded carboxy-terminal
domain (amino acids 73-86) of the naturally-occurring
tat protein. By virtue of the absence of the cysteine-rich
region found in conventional tat proteins, the
transport polypeptides of this invention solve the
problems of spurious trans-activation and disulfide
aggregation. The reduced size of the transport
polypeptides of this invention also minimizes 
interference with the biological activity of the cargo
molecule.Biological cells are generally impermeable to
macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids.
Some small molecules enter living cells at very low
rates. The lack of means for delivering macromolecules
into cells in vivo has been an obstacle to the
therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic use of a
potentially large number of proteins and nucleic acids
having intracellular sites of action. Accordingly,
most therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic
candidates produced to date using recombinant DNA
technology are polypeptides that act in the
extracellular environment or on the target cell
surface.Various methods have been developed for
delivering macromolecules into cells in vitro. A list
of such methods includes electroporation, membrane
fusion with liposomes, high velocity bombardment with
DNA-coated microprojectiles, incubation with calcium-phosphate-DNA
precipitate, DEAE-dextran mediated
transfection, infection with modified viral nucleic
acids, and direct micro-injection into single cells.
These in vitro methods typically deliver the nucleic
acid molecules into only a fraction of the total cell
population, and they tend to damage large numbers of
cells. Experimental delivery of macromolecules into
cells in vivo has been accomplished with scrape
loading, calcium phosphate precipitates and liposomes.
However, these techniques
