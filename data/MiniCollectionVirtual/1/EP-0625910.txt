<ABSTRACT>
A dual carrier immunogenic construct comprised of at least one primary carrier comprising large molecular weight molecule of greater than a 70 KD molecular weight and at least one secondary carrier comprising a T-dependent antigen conjugated to a primary carrier. The dual carrier immunogenic construct may further comprise moieties such as haptens and antigens. Such immunogenic constructs are suitable for use in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dual carrier immunogenic
construct that enhances the effectiveness of active
immunization for animals and humans and for development of
antibodies to be used for passive immunoprophylaxis or
therapy and as scientific or diagnostic reagents.In the process of vaccination, medical science uses the
body's innate ability to protect itself against invading
agents by immunizing the body with antigens that will not
cause the disease but will stimulate the formation of
antibodies that will protect against the disease. For
example, dead organisms are injected to protect against
bacterial diseases such as typhoid fever and whooping cough,
toxins are injected to protect against tetanus and botulism,
and attenuated organisms are injected to protect against
viral diseases such as poliomyelitis and measles.It is not always possible, however, to stimulate
antibody formation merely by injecting the foreign agent.
The vaccine preparation must be immunogenic, that is, it must
be able to induce an immune response. Certain agents such as
tetanus toxoid are innately immunogenic, and may be
administered in vaccines without modification. Other
important agents are not immunogenic, however, and must be
converted into immunogenic molecules before they can induce
an immune response.The immune response is a complex series of reactions
that can generally be described as follows:
1. the antigen enters the body and encounters
antigen-presenting cells which process the antigen and retain
fragments of the antigen on their surfaces; 2. the antigen fragment retained on the antigen
presenting cells are recognized by T cells that provide help
to B cells; and3. the B cells are stimulated to proliferate and
divide into antibody forming cells that secrete antibody
against the antigen.Most antigens only elicit antibodies with assistance
from the T cells and, hence, are known as T-dependent (TD).
These antigens, such as proteins, can be processed by antigen
presenting cells and thus activate T cells in the process
described above. Examples of such T-dependent antigens are
tetanus and diphtheria toxoids.Some antigens, such as polysaccharides, cannot be
properly processed by antigen presenting cells and are not
recognized by T cells. These antigens do not require T cell
assistance to elicit antibody formation but can activate B
cells directly and, hence, are known as T-independent
antigens (TI). Such T-independent antigens include H.
influenzae type b polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate and
pneumococcal capsular
