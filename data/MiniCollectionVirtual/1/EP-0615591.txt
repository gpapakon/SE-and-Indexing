<ABSTRACT>
A mixing valve (10) has a limiting mechanism (26) for controlling the maximum flow rate and maximum temperature mix for the mixed water. The limiting mechanism (26) includes a rotatable plate member (70) retained on a cap assembly (56) by a positioning ring member (82). The plate member (70) has a slot (74) that receives a control stem (22) of valve element (20). A handle (92) has a leg section (96) that fits onto control stem (22) and has a cross-sectional shape that prevents the handle from rotating about the control stem axis. The positioning ring (82) limits the rotation of the plate member (70) to define a maximum temperature mix of the discharged water through outlet port (30) of the mixing valve (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention relates to a
faucet mixing valve according to the preamble portions of claims 1 and 16, respectively, and more particularly to a volume
and temperature limit device for a mixing valve.Single handle faucets, commonly referred to as
mixer valves, that control the flow of both hot and cold
water have seen vast consumer acceptance. The faucets
are commonly constructed such that a handle or knob is
movable in two distinct direction to adjust the mix of
hot and cold water and to adjust the volume or flow
rate.The two basic types of mixer valves that have
seen widest commercial acceptance are plate valves and
ball valves. Ball valves are renowned for reliable and
durable one piece valve construction that is easily
assembled. Plate valves on the other hand offer a drive
mechanism that allows motion of the handle in two
distinct directions that has found widest commercial
acceptance. This desirable handle motion allows for an
orbiting motion of the handle about a fixed axis of the
valve body and a rocking, i.e. pivoting motion about a
axis that moves with respect to the valve housing as the
handle orbits about the fixed axis. The moving axis is
perpendicular to the fixed axis of the valve housing.
A characteristic of this type of handle motion is that
when the handle is pivoted to an off position, the mix
ratio of hot and cold water can be remembered by the 
location of the handle so that when the faucet is turned
back on, one has the option of obtaining the same mix of
hot and cold water flows through the faucet.Recently, ball valves have been devised that
allow the handle to be operated in the same fashion as
the above described plate type mixer valves. The system
is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,449,551
issued to Lorch on May 22, 1984. Another stem is
disclosed in PCT application PCT/US91/07816 (WO 92/22765) filed on
October 22, 1991 by the present applicant.Most plate type and ball type mixing valves
have a control stem extending out from the valve housing
and being connectable to a handle to control the position of
the valve. The extent of motion for controlling the
maximum amount of flow and the maximum temperature of
the water is commonly defined by the shape of the
opening or by structures placed under an adjustment ring
screwed into the cap member to tighten the valve assembly
against leakage. The internal position of the volume
and temperature limiters renders them difficult to
change. Repair or replacement of the limit structures
requires that the main water line
