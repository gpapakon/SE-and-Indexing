<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine airfoil (22) has an external surface (38) and an internal passage (34) therethrough. The internal passage (34) is selectively coated by providing a source of a flowable precursor coating material in contact with the internal passage (34) of the airfoil (22), and providing a coating prevention structure (78) overlying at least a portion of the external surface (38). The flowable precursor coating material is flowed from the source of the flowable precursor coating material and through the internal passage (34) of the airfoil (22). The coating prevention structure (78) prevents contact of the flowable precursor coating material with the external surface (38) of the airfoil (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas turbine airfoil having an internal cooling
passage, and, more particularly, to the selective protection of the surface of
the internal passage of such a gas turbine airfoil.In an aircraft gas turbine (jet) engine, air is drawn into the front of the
engine, compressed by a shaft-mounted compressor, and mixed with fuel.
The mixture is burned, and the hot exhaust gases are passed through a
turbine mounted on the same shaft. The flow of combustion gas turns the
turbine by impingement against an airfoil section of the turbine blades and
vanes, which turns the shaft and provides power to the compressor and fan.
The hot exhaust gases flow from the back of the engine, driving it and the
aircraft forwardly.The hotter the combustion and exhaust gases, the more efficient is the
operation of the jet engine. There is thus an incentive to raise the
combustion and exhaust gas temperatures. The maximum temperature of
the combustion gases is normally limited by the materials used to fabricate
the turbine vanes and turbine blades of the turbine, upon which the hot
combustion gases impinge. In current engines, the turbine vanes and
blades are made of nickel-based superalloys, and can operate at
temperatures of up to about 1900-2100Â°F.Many approaches have been used to increase the operating temperature
limit of the turbine blades and vanes to their current levels. For example,
the composition and processing of the base materials themselves have
been improved. Physical cooling techniques may also be used. In one technique, internal
cooling passages through the interior of the turbine airfoil are present. Air is
forced through the cooling passages and out openings at the external
surface of the airfoil, removing heat from the interior of the airfoil and, in
some cases, providing a boundary layer of cooler air at the surface of the
airfoil. To attain maximum cooling efficiency, the cooling passages are
placed as closely to the external surface of the airfoil as is consistent with
maintaining the required mechanical properties of the airfoil, to as little as
about 0.020 inch in some cases.In another approach, a protective layer or a ceramic/metal thermal barrier
coating (TBC) system is applied to the airfoil, which acts as a substrate. The
protective layer with no overlying ceramic layer (in which case the protective
layer is termed an "environmental coating") is useful in intermediate-temperature
applications. The currently known protective layers include
diffusion aluminides and MCrAIX
