<ABSTRACT>
An entry step for rail vehicles has at least one step which can be moved outwards in the region of the entry. In order to be able to adapt the entry to different heights of platforms or passenger waiting areas and/or to different distances from the platform or from the passenger waiting area, at least three steps (1, 2, 3) are provided, at least the lowest step (1) of which is constructed so as to be capable of moving out and the top step (3) of which is constructed so as to be capable of moving out and of being retracted.

<CLAIMS>
An entrance for railway vehicles having at least three 
steps in the entrance region, of which at least the 

lowest step is constructed so that it can be separately 
moved outwards in relation to the vehicle shell,
characterised in that
 at least the uppermost step (3) of 
the upper steps is constructed so that it can move out 

and in separately in relation to the vehicle shell,
and in that
 the final position of the extension movement 
of the steps (1, 3) is determined by means for limiting 

the movement. 
An entrance according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the middle step (2) or the middle 
steps (2, 2') has or have a fixed arrangement. 
An entrance according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the middle steps (2, 2') are 
constructed so that they can be moved outwardly and/or 

inwardly. 
An entrance according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the lowest step (1) or lower steps 
(1, 2) is disposed concealed behind the railway vehicle 

shell (6) or beneath the vehicle base in the non-operative 
state. 
An entrance according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the steps (1, 2, 2', 3) with their 
guide mechanisms and drives are installed in a box (10) 

consisting of a steel sheet or frame construction, which 
is integrated in the coach body construction of the 

railway vehicle.  
 
An entrance according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the box (10) is fixed to the 
frame stretcher or to reinforcing sheets of the 

substructure of the coach body. 
An entrance according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 the movable steps with guide 
mechanisms and drives are in each case separate 

units mounted separately on the coach body 
construction of the railway vehicle. 
An entrance according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 the middle step (2) or the 
middle steps (2, 2') are constructed as fixed 

components of the coach body of the railway vehicle. 
An entrance according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 the lowest step (1) is 
extensibly mounted and guided in a guide bar bracket 

(20) or a telescopic extension. 
An entrance according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 to push out the step (1) a 
motor-driven (32), hydraulically driven or 

pneumatically driven toothed wheel/rack-and-pinion 
drive (30) or birotatory spindle drive (34) with a 

shearing mechanism or direct spindle drive (38) is 
provided. 
An entrance according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 the lowest step (1) is mounted 
so that it can swivel out on a strut arm (46) which 

can be actuated by a driving cylinder (44).  
 
An entrance according to one of Claims to 7,
characterised in that
 the lowest step (1) is 
disposed so that it can swing out around an axis of 

rotation (4/). 
An entrance according to Claim 12,
characterised in that
 to swing out the step (1) a 
motor-driven (48) worm 
or gear drive (50) is 
provided. 
An entrance according to Claim 12 or 13,
characterised in that
 in the non-operative state the 
lowest step (1) forms a part of the shell of the 

railway vehicle or can be retracted behind the 
shell. 
An entrance according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 in the non-operative or 
initial position the uppermost step (3) forms a part 

of the floor of the passenger compartment (5) in the 
door region and ends flush with the outer edge of 

the vehicle and is also constructed extensibly and 
retractably beneath the floor of the passenger 

compartment in such a manner that in the retracted 
position the middle step (2) or the middle steps 

(2'), which in the non-operative position of the 
upper step (3) is or are covered by this step, are 

freed. 
An entrance according to Claim 15,
characterised in that
 to extend and retract the 
uppermost step (3) a displaceable mounting and guide 

mechanism is provided in lateral guide bar brackets 
or in a telescopic extension and a motorised drive  

 
is provided via a toothed wheel/spindle drive (56) 

or a toothed wheel/rack-and-pinion drive (58). 
An entrance according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the means for limiting the 
movement are locking devices and/or stops. 
An entrance according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 in the direction of movement 
the upper step (3) consists of three parts (70, 72, 

74), of which the two outer parts (70, 74) are 
pivoted in the step frame at their front ends and at 

their rear ends are constructed so that they can be 
lifted by a lifting device (80).
