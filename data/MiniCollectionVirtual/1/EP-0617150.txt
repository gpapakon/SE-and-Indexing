<ABSTRACT>
The absorbency of regenerated viscose filaments (3) is 
improved by overfeeding a continuous tow (4) of partially 

regenerated filaments onto a moving foraminous support (8) so 
that regeneration occurs prior to and after the filament tow 

is overfed onto the moving support.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fibre webs and has particular
reference to the production of continuous filament cellulosic
fibre tow webs. In GB-A-1387566 there is described a process
for improving the properties of a continuous filament tow web
by suspending a running tow in a flowing liquid in the form
of a spread band, overfeeding the spread tow onto a moving
foraminous support separated from the liquid and to form a
coherent web, drying the web and then stretching the web to
pull it back into tow form.It has now been discovered that by adopting a
modification to the process described in GB-A-1387566
an improved tow web structure can be produced.The present invention is concerned with the production
of a continuous tow web of viscose cellulosic fibres. As is
well known, viscose cellulosic fibres are produced by spinning
viscose dope in the form of a solution of sodium cellulose
xanthate having a cellulose content in the range 5 to 12% by
weight and a caustic soda content of 4 to 10% preferably 5 to
7% by weight into an acidic regeneration bath, typically
containing 7 to 10% sulphuric acid, 10 to 28% sodium sulphate,
and 0 to 4%, more specifically 0.5 to 1.5%, zinc sulphate in
a bath at 30 to 70°C, more specifically 45 to 60°C, so as to
neutralise the alkali and to coagulate and regenerate the
cellulose to form cellulosic fibres. The viscose dope may
have a full range of salt figures, although 4 to 12 are
preferred. Regeneration occurs from the surface of the fibres,
where a skin of cellulose is initially formed, through into
the interior of the fibres. By the present invention, there is provided a process for
producing
a continuous filament tow of regenerated viscose cellulose
filaments, in which process a running tow in a flowing liquid
in the form of a spread band is overfed onto a moving
foraminous support to separate it from the liquid, so as to
form a coherent web, which web is dried, wherein the
improvement comprises having the continuous filament tow of
cellulosic viscose filaments in the partially regenerated
state when it is overfed onto the moving foraminous support
so that the regeneration of the partially regenerated viscose
occurs prior to and after the filament tow is overfed onto
the moving foraminous support.Preferably, the dried web is then stretched back into tow
form. Further preferably, the web is kept in its overfed
state during drying. Further preferably the process is
carried out by passing the tow through a spreader box and
impacting the spread band upon the foraminous support

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a
continuous filament tow (4) of regenerated viscose cellulose

filaments (3) in which process a running tow in a flowing
liquid in the form of a spread band is overfed onto a moving

foraminous support (8) to separate it from the liquid, so as
to form a coherent web, which web is dried, characterised in

that the continuous filament tow (4) of cellulosic viscose
filaments is in the partially regenerated state when it is

overfed onto the moving foraminous support (8) so that the
regeneration of the partially regenerated viscose occurs prior

to and after the filament tow (4) is overfed onto the moving
foraminous support (8).
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 further
characterised in that the dried web is stretched back into tow

form.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 further
characterised in that the process is carried out by passing

the tow (4) through a spreader box (7) and impacting the
spread tow upon the foraminous support (8) through a wedge-shaped

channel (36).
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3
further c
haracterised in that the foraminous support (8) is
moved at a speed in the range 5 to 30 times slower that the

rate of feed of the spread band onto the foraminous support.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4
further characterised in that the web on the foraminous

support is washed by means of a spray wash liquor.
A process as claimed in claim 1 further
characterised in that the regeneration occurs additionally

during the overfeeding process. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6
further characterised in that the web (4) is kept in the

overfed state during drying in a dryer (26).
A process as claimed in claim 6 further
characterised in that the flowing liquid is acidic at the

point of contact of the tow (4) with the support (8).
A process as claimed in any preceding claim further
characterised in that the filaments (3) have a decitex in the

range 0.5 to 5.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim further
characterised in that the web has a basis weight of 500 to

1500 gm/sq metre after drying and before any extension of the
web.
A process as claimed in claim 10 further
characterised in that the basis weight of the web after drying

is in the range 650 to 850 gm/sq. metre.
