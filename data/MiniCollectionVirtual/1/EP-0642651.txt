<CLAIMS>
A process for dewatering fine-particle solids suspensions, 
in which dialkyl carbonates corresponding to formula 


(I):
 
in which 


R¹ and R²
independently of one another represent alkyl 
and/or alkenyl groups containing 1 to 22 carbon atoms 

and 
m and n
independently of one another stand for 0 or 
numbers of 1 to 10, 
 
are used as auxiliaries. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
dialkyl carbonates corresponding to formula 
(I)
, in which 
R¹ represents C₈₋₁₈ alkyl groups, R² represents C₂ or C₈₋₁₈ 

alkyl groups and n and m stand for 0 or numbers of 2 to 7, 
are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
suspensions of iron ore concentrates, quartz sand, coal or 

coke are dewatered. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the dialkyl carbonates are used in quantities of 10 to 500 

g per tonne of solids. 
The use of dialkyl carbonates corresponding to formula 

(I)
 as auxiliaries in the dewatering of fine-particle 
solids suspensions, particularly in the recycling of 

wastepaper.
