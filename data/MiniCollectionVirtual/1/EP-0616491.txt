<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tilting device for components which are located in housings and can be withdrawn via telescopic rails, such as electronic printers, for example. Access to these components by the operator is difficult when they are installed. In order to improve the accessibility, the invention provides for a supporting frame (2) to be fitted on the telescopic rails (1) and for a stationary latching disc (3), which is constructed in a semicircular shape and has at least two latching grooves (4, 8), to be mounted on the said supporting frame (2) and on the telescopic rails (1). A latching bolt (6) is located on a bolt lever (5) which is firmly coupled to the component (9), which latching bolt (6) moves along the periphery (7) of the latching disc (9) while the bolt lever (5) is pivoting, until it engages in one of the latching grooves (4, 8). This overcomes the disadvantage of difficult accessibility of the apparatus, in a simple manner.
