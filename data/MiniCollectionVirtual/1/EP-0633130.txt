<ABSTRACT>
A tread ring transfer apparatus for use in a green 
tyre building system, comprises a ring-shaped holder 

frame (6) and a plurality of holding segments (20) 
carried by the holder frame. The holding segments 

(20) each have contact members (7) for directly 
supporting the tread ring being transferred. The 

contact members are arranged circumferentially of 
the ring-shaped holder frame at different intervals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
transferring a tread ring which is used in a green
tyre building system.In green tyre building systems, a tread ring is
built on a tread ring forming drum, and then
transferred by a transfer ring apparatus from the
tread ring forming drum to be positioned around
carcass plies place on tyre building drum.Figure 8 shows the principal portion of a typical
conventional transfer ring apparatus known from JP-A-2512834.
The conventional transfer ring apparatus
comprises a holder frame 100 in the form of a ring
and a number of holding segments 101 provided inside
the ring-shaped holder frame 100. The holder frame
100 is reciprocally movable from the tread ring
forming drum to the tyre building drum, and vice
versa. Each holding segment 101 has a rectangular
supporting member 102 on an inner end thereof. The
supporting members 102 are arranged in a
circumferential direction equally spaced. The
supporting members 102 can be moved in radially of 
the ring-shaped holder frame 100. The supporting
members 102 are simultaneously moved inwards to hold
a tread ring T and moved outwards to release the
holding of the tread ring T.In tyres produced using the conventional transfer
ring apparatus provided with equally spaced
supporting members 102, however, there have been
noticeable Radial Force Variations (referred to as
"RFV" hereinafter) in the high variation modes.It will be seen that vibrations caused by RFVs in
the high variation modes are liable to resonate with
vibrations of particular parts of an automotive
vehicle running at high speeds, and thus generate
undesirable noises. Accordingly, there have been
demands for making the RFV in the high variation
modes as low as possible.It is an object of the invention to provide an
apparatus for transferring a tread ring to overcome
the aforementioned problems in the prior art.It is another object of the invention to provide a
tread ring transfer apparatus which can assure 
production of tyres having less RFVs in high
variation modes.According to the present invention, a tread ring
transfer apparatus for use in a green tyre building
system, comprising a holder frame in the form of a
ring, a plurality of holding segments carried by the
holder frame and a plurality of supporting members
operable between a tread ring holding state and a
tread ring releasing state, each holding segment
characterised by the supporting members each
projecting from an inner surface of the holder frame
and being movable in the radial direction of the
holder
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tread ring transfer apparatus (1) for use in
a green tyre building system, comprising a holder

frame (6) in the form of a ring, a plurality of
holding segments (20) carried by the holder frame

(6) and a plurality of supporting members (8)
operable between a tread ring holding state and a

tread ring releasing state, each holding segment
(20) characterised by the supporting members (8)

each projecting from an inner surface of the holder
frame (6) and being movable in the radial direction

of the holder frame (6), the supporting member (8)
having contact portions (7), the supporting member

(8) being operable to bring the contract portions
(7) into contact with an outer surface of a tread

ring being transferred, and the contact portions (7)
being arranged in a circumferential direction at

different intervals.
A tread ring transfer apparatus according to
claim 1 characterised in that the contact portions

(7) are arranged in such a manner that any adjacent
two of an arbitrary number of contact portions (7)

have no interval equal to an angle which is obtained
by dividing 360Â° by the arbitrary number. 
A tread ring transfer apparatus according to
claim 1 or 2 characterised by an arm member (9)

extending and being movable radially of the holder
frame (6), the supporting member (8) attached on an

inner end of the arm member (9), the supporting
member (8) extending in a circumferential direction,

and the contact portion (7) being attached on an
inner surface of the supporting member (8).
A tread ring transfer apparatus according to
claim 3 characterised in that the contact portion

(7) is attachable on a selective position of the
inner surface of the supporting member (8) to change

the circumferential arrangement of contact portions
(7).
A tread ring transfer apparatus according to
claim 3 characterised in that the tread ring has a

centre flat portion and shoulder portions positioned
axially outside the centre flat portion, and each

contact portion (7) is in the form of a rectangle
whose axial width is equal to or smaller than the

axial width of the centre flat portion of the tread
ring.
