<ABSTRACT>
A cellular radio network, and methods for updating location and setting up a call in a cellular radio network. The network comprises at least one mobile subsystem (10), which serves conventional mobile stations (MS). The network knows the location of the subsystem (10) and the mobile stations (MS) with an accuracy of a location area. The location data of a mobile station registered in the subsystem is the identification data of the subsystem, which is not updated again until the radio station leaves the subsystem. In the call set-up, a two-stage interrogation is conducted: first, the identifier of the subsystem is obtained as the location data of the mobile station; second, the current location of the subsystem where the call will be routed to is obtained by means of said identifier of the subsystem.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cellular radio network
comprising mobile stations capable of roaming
within the cellular radio network in such a manner that
location data of the mobile stations is stared in the
cellular radio network with an accuracy at a location
area, consisting of one or more cells, and at least one
mobile subsystem capable of roaming within the cellular
radio network and serving said mobile stations.In a cellular radio network, base stations
continuously broadcast information about themselves and
their environment. Such information may include, for
example, a location area identifier, base station
identifier, base station type, and so-called neighbouring
cell information. When a mobile station is
registered in the base station of a certain cell, it
monitors the quality of the transmission of the neighbouring
base stations and changes to one of these neighbouring
base stations if the quality of the transmission
of the present base station becomes low enough. A
cellular radio network must usually have information on
the roaming of a mobile station within the network radio
coverage area with an accuracy of a so-called location
area, which comprises a suitable number of predetermined
cells and their base stations. In connection with the
updating of the location of a mobile station, the
identifier of this location area will be stored in the
subscriber data bases in the network. The location data
of the subscriber indicates thus a physical and geographical
area within the radio coverage area of the 
cellular radio network. The location area information
broadcasted by a base station informs a mobile station
of the location area to which the base station belongs.
When the mobile station moves to another cell within the
same location area, location updating to the cellular
radio network is not needed, i.e. the location data does
not change. However, when the mobile station, on the
basis of location area information, observes that the
location area changes with the new base station, it
starts location updating by sending a location updating
request to the cellular radio network. As a result of
this location updating request, the cellular radio network
updates the location data of the subscriber with
the identifier of the new location area.The system described above operates well in a
conventional network. In the future, however, a fixed
cellular radio network area may comprise mobile radio
exchanges or systems disposed e.g. on trains, ships or
possibly even aeroplanes to serve mobile stations

A cellular radio network comprising:

mobile stations capable of roaming within the
cellular radio network in such a manner, that location

data of the mobile stations, which data indicates the
location of the mobile stations, is stored in the

cellular radio network with an accuracy of a location
area, consisting of one or more cells, and
at least one mobile subsystem capable of roaming
within the cellular radio network and serving said

mobile stations, the cellular radio network being
characterized by:
means for storing location data of said at least
one mobile subsystem, which data indicates the location

of the at least one mobile subsystem, in the cellular
radio network with an accuracy of a location area, and
means for storing identification data of said
mobile subsystem, which data identifies the mobile

subsystem, in the cellular radio network as the location
data of a mobile station registered in said mobile

subsystem.
A cellular radio network according to claim 1,
characterized in that said at least one mobile subsystem

comprises a local radio system which is disposed in a
mobile vehicle, such as a train, ship or car, and which

comprises means for communicating with base stations of
the cellular radio network over a radio path, and means

for communicating with mobile stations over a radio
path.
A cellular radio network according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that said mobile subsystem comprises a

mobile radio exchange. 
A method for updating location in a cellular radio
network comprising mobile stations capable of roaming

within the cellular radio network in such a manner that
the location of the mobile stations is known with an

accuracy of a location area, consisting of one or more

cells, and further comprising at least one mobile
subsystem capable of roaming within the cellular radio

network and serving said mobile stations, in which
method the updating of the location data of a mobile

station not registered in said subsystem, which data
indicates the location of the mobile station, is started

whenever the mobile station enters a new location area
within the cellular radio network, characterized in that


the location data of a mobile station entering said
at least one mobile subsystem is updated, whereby the

cellular network stores the identification data of said
mobile subsystem, which data identifies the mobile

subsystem, as the location data of said mobile station,
and
when said at least one mobile subsystem and the
mobile stations registered in it enter a new location

area within the cellular radio network, only the
location data of said mobile subsystem, which data

indicates the location of the at least one mobile
subsystem, is updated.
A method according to claim 4, characterized in
that the location data of a mobile station stored in the

cellular radio network is not updated again until said
mobile station leaves said mobile subsystem.
A method for setting up a call in a cellular radio
network comprising mobile stations capable of roaming

within the cellular radio network in such a manner that
the location of the mobile stations is known with an

accuracy of a location area, consisting of one or more
cells, and further comprising at least one mobile 

subsystem capable of roaming within the cellular radio
network and serving said mobile stations, in which

method a call to a mobile station is routed by means of
the location data stored in the cellular radio network,

characterized in that a call to a mobile station
registered in the mobile subsystem is routed as follows:


the location data of the mobile station, which data
indicates the location of the mobile stations, stored in

the cellular radio network is interrogated, said
location data being the identifier of the mobile

subsystem,
the location data which corresponds to said
subsystem identifier and which is stored in the cellular

radio network is interrogated,
the call is routed to the subsystem and further to
the mobile station by means of the location data of the

subsystem, which data indicates the location of the at
least one mobile subsystem.
