<ABSTRACT>
When an electric appliance 28 is connected, the output 
P
e
 of an engine 22 is maintained by reducing the output of a 
generator 
28 by the equivalent of the power A - B consumed 
by the electric appliance 28 while maintaining the revolution 

speed N
e
 of the engine 22. The revolution speed N
e
 of 
the engine 22 is then gradually increased by adjusting the 

field current I
f
 of the generator 18 while monitoring the 
output P
G
 of the generator 18. When the output P
e
 of the 
engine 22 is increased by this control, the engine 22 is 

operated at a constant revolution speed and a constant 
output at the operation point P. Thus, the engine 22 is 

prevented from stopping due to a rapid increase in the load. 
Owing to a gentle change in the output, the emission is 

favorable. Since the output of the engine does not deviate 
from the output line of the engine with WOT, the fuel 

consumption is also good.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hybrid vehicle in 
which the engine drives a generator so as to generate the 
electric power for a driving motor and the output of the 
engine drives an electrical appliance such as an air conditioning 
system. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a control method for an electrical appliance such 
as an air conditioning system especially at the time of 
starting and stopping the air conditioning system. An electric vehicle provided with an engine as well as 
a driving motor, namely, a hybrid vehicle is well known. 
For example (see WO-A-93 07018), 
in a series hybrid vehicle, a generator is 
driven by the engine, and the motor is driven by the output 
of the generator. The motor is also driven by the discharge 
output of a battery mounted on the vehicle. The battery is 
charged by the output of the generator as well as by external 
power and regenerated power. This type of a vehicle is 
therefore advantageous in that a reduction in the size of 
the battery mounted thereon, as well as the frequency 
charging the battery by external power, is possible.  
 It is favorable from the point of view of comfortable 
driving conditions to mount an air conditioning system on a 
vehicle, such as an electric vehicle. In order to mount an 
air conditioning system on a vehicle, it is necessary to 
somehow produce power for driving the system on the vehicle. 
In the case of an electric vehicle, it is possible to 
utilize the output of the generator and the discharge power 
of the battery as the driving power for the air conditioning 
system. This method, however, is disadvantageous from the 
point of view of cost, because since the air conditioning 
system is driven by electric power, a motor or the like for 
driving a compressor of the air conditioning system is 
necessary. In contrast, as a method which is advantageous 
from the point of view of cost, there is a method of diverting 
an air conditioning system of a vehicle driven only by 
an engine, i.e., connecting the output shaft of the engine 
to the compressor of the air conditioning system so as to 
drive the compressor by the mechanical output of the engine. In such a method of driving the compressor by the 
output of the engine, however, the load of the engine 
rapidly increases at the time of turning on the air conditioning 
system. This rapidly reduces the revolution speed 
of the engine and, in a worst case, stops the engine. In 
order to prevent the engine from stopping in this way, it is 
possible to
