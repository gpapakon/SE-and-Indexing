<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises impregnating a 
solution while controlling the concentration in response to a 

quantity of transmitted light from a laser beam through a soot-like 
deposit of core forming 

glass (26), by which the desired doping concentration is ensured 
independently of the density of the soot-like core forming glass. 
A modification to the process comprises 
repeatedly depositing 

a soot-like core forming glass (26) at different temperatures, by 
which a distribution of a doping concentration in the radial 

direction of the core can be set as desired. 
A further modification to the process comprises forming two 
constricted portions (28) at opposite ends of a 

quartz reaction tube (4), 
charging a solution of a compound of a rare earth element as a 

solution into the section of the tube 
between the constricted portions (28) 

for doping. By this method, the doping concentration becomes uniform 
along the length of the optical fiber preform (30) with defects 

being rarely produced and without any 
complicated operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is divided from European patent 
application 90 916 042.6. This invention relates to a process for fabricating an 
optical fiber preform and more particularly, to a process 
for fabricating an optical fiber preform which is suitable 
for production of an optical fiber whose core is doped with 
a rare earth element (or ion). Light amplifiers in which light signals are directly 
amplified without conversion into electric signals have been 
extensively studied in various research and investigation 
facilities and expected as a key device of future light 
transmission systems. This is because the light amplifier 
is, in fact, free of any bit rate with ease in great 
capacitance and information from a multichannel can be 
amplified as a whole. One of such a light amplifier is a 
light amplifier which makes use of an optical fiber whose 
cores is doped with a rare earth element (or ion) such as Er, 
Nd, Yb or the like (which may be hereinafter referred to 
simply as "doped fiber") and wherein signal light and 
pumping light are introduced into the doped fiber in the 
same or opposite directions. The optical fiber amplifier  
 
using the doped fiber has the advantages that the gain is 
not of the polarization dependence with low noises and that 
the combination loss with a transmission path is small. 
This type of optical fiber amplifier may be particularly 
applied in the following manner. 
(a) At the transmission side, the optical fiber 
amplifier is employed as an optical power booster to 
compensate for a possible loss or to increase the 
transmission power. (b) At the receiving side, the optical fiber amplifier 
is used as an optical pre-amplifier to improve the receiving 
sensitivity. (c) The optical fiber amplifier is used as a repeater 
to make a small-sized and reliable repeater.   With light whose wavelength is in the range of 0.8 - 
1.6 Âµm, production and application techniques of optical 
fibers using quartz glass adapted for long-range 
transmission have been established. The optical fiber is 
obtained by drawing an optical fiber preform in the form of 
a thick rod. The optical fiber preform should have a 
compositional gradient along the section thereof which is 
properly formulated as designed. A typical and known method 
of producing an optical fiber preform is one wherein a glass 
composition formed by chemical conversion of reactant gases 
is deposited on a quartz reaction tube such as by MCVD  
 
(modified chemical vapour deposition). In the MCVD process, 
reactant

A process for producing an optical fiber preform, which 
comprises: 


a first step of forming a soot-like core glass by 
heating fine powder of an oxide glass deposited by vapour 

phase reaction in a quartz reaction tube; 
a second step of transmitting a laser beam through 
the quartz reaction tube and through said soot-like core 

glass formed therein, and measuring a quantity of the light 
transmitted through the reaction tube and soot-like core 

glass (26); 
a third step of charging a solution of a compound of 
a rare earth element used as a solute into the quartz 

reaction tube in a controlled amount depending on the 
quantity of the transmitted light, thereby permitting the 

solution to impregnate said soot-like core glass; 
a fourth step of heating the solute-containing soot-like 
core glass until the glass is vitrified; and 
a fifth step of heating said quartz reaction tube for 
collapsing. 
A process for producing an optical fiber preform 
according to claim 1, wherein the concentration of the 

solution in the third step is so controlled that the 
concentration is decreased with an increase in the quantity 

of transmitted light.
