<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a synthetic resin powder 
having an improved blocking resistance suitable as a 

modifier for vinyl chloride resins, which comprises 
coagulating an aqueous latex of a graft copolymer suitable 

as a modifier for vinyl chloride resins, mixing the 

resulting slurry with a latex of a specific polymer of 
methyl methacrylate, an aromatic vinyl compound, a 

crosslinking monomer and optionally other copolymerizable 
monomers or a slurry formed from the specific polymer 

latex by coagulation, and recovering a powder from the 
resulting mixture containing the coagulated graft 

copolymer and the coagulated specific polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing a synthetic resin powder having an improved
blocking resistance, and more particularly to a process
for improving blocking resistance of graft copolymers
containing a rubber as a trunk polymer which are intended
to incorporate into vinyl chloride resins in order to
improve the properties of the vinyl chloride resins.Improvement in powder properties of synthetic
resins, particularly bulk density and blocking resistance
of the powders, has hitherto been made in various manners.
For instance, in Japanese Patent Publication Kokai No.
57-5992 it is proposed to coagulate a latex of a graft
copolymer in a gaseous phase. This method improves the
blocking resistance of the graft copolymer powder to a
great degree.Various graft copolymers wherein monomers are
graft-polymerized onto an elastomer trunk, have been
proposed and used as modifiers for vinyl chloride resins,
particularly as impact modifiers, e.g. ABS resin, MBS
resin and MABS resin. These graft copolymers used as
modifiers for vinyl chloride resins are not satisfactory
in blocking resistance.In recent years, improvement in powder properties
of synthetic resins such as blocking resistance has been
increasingly demanded with application of automatic gaging
to powders and change of transportation lines to large
scale. Accordingly, further improvement of powder
properties has been investigated.For instance, Japanese Patent Publication Kokoku
No. 58-48584 proposes to improve the powder properties of
a conventional graft copolymer containing a large quantity
of a rubber, such as impact modifier for vinyl chloride
resins, by mixing it with a graft copolymer having a low
content of a rubber in the form of a slurry. However, the 
effect of improving the powder properties of this method
is small, since the graft copolymer added for the
improvement of powder properties contains a rubber though
the content is low. This Japanese publication also
discloses in Comparative Example 3 to incorporate a
polymer containing no rubber component, namely a copolymer
of 55 % by weight of methyl methacrylate and 45 % by
weight of styrene, into a conventional graft copolymer
known as a modifier. In that case, powder properties of
the conventional graft copolymer are improved, but the
effect of the improvement is small like in the case of
using a graft copolymer having a low rubber content as an
improving agent. Moreover, it is disclosed that a large
number of fish eyes generate in molded articles prepared
from a vinyl

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a powder of a
synthetic resin having an improved blocking resistance

which comprises the steps of coagulating an aqueous latex
of a graft copolymer containing at least 40 % by weight of

a rubber as a trunk polymer to give a first aqueous
slurry, said graft copolymer being a copolymer intended to

incorporate into a vinyl chloride resin as a modifier
therefor, mixing said first aqueous slurry with 0.1 to 10

parts by weight of a polymer of (a) 30 to 60 % by weight of
methyl methacrylate, (b) 65 to 35 % by weight of an aromatic

vinyl monomer, (c) 0.1 to 25 % by weight of a crosslinking
monomer and (d) 0 to 30 % by weight of other copolymerizable

monomers per 100 parts by weight of said graft copolymer
in the form of an aqueous latex or a slurry as a second

aqueous slurry, coagulating said polymer before mixing
with said first aqueous slurry to give said second aqueous

slurry or after mixing with said first aqueous slurry, and
recovering a powder from the resulting mixture,

the sum of the components (a) to (d) being 100% by weight,
wherein


said other copolymerizable monomers (d) are
selected from the group consisting of a vinyl cyano compound,

acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, an alkyl acrylate, an alkyl
methacrylate other than methyl methacrylate, and a

graftlinking monomer and
said polymer in said aqueous latex to be mixed with said
first aqueous slurry of said graft copolymer has an average

particle size of 1200 to 2500 Å.
The process of Claim 1, wherein
the difference in index of refraction

between
a vinyl chloride and said polymer in said aqueous latex to be mixed with said first aqueous slurry of said graft copolymer resin
 is at most 0.1. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein said
recovering is carried out by heat-treating, dehydrating

and drying said mixture. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein said first
slurry containing the graft copolymer has a solid

concentration of 5 to 40 % by weight.
The process of Claim 1, wherein said aromatic
vinyl monomer is styrene, α-methylstyrene or a mixture

thereof.
The process of Claim 1, wherein said
crosslinking monomer is a member selected from the group

consisting of a divinyl compound, a diacrylate compound
and a dimethacrylate compound.
