<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display apparatus for
displaying clinical test results obtained by a sample analyzer,
and more particularly to a clinical test result display apparatus
for displaying test results such as information that can be used
for diagnosis (for example, information on hematosis or abnormal
conditions).Conventional sample analyzers include, for example, a blood
cell analyzer which counts the number of cells in blood such as
white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and platelets (PLT)
by detecting differences between such cells in electric or optical
properties.Such sample analyzer converts a variety of measured data
into numerical data or particle distribution charts (one or two dimensional
distribution) to which some additional information
(flags or messages) is added and displayed on a screen of the analyzer
in order to help clinical diagnosis.A method for analyzing blood data is proposed which involves
judging numerical data such as the number of white blood cells and
red blood cells and data on particle distribution by quantitatively
comparing actually measured data (object) and preliminarily set
criteria (thresholds) for each message (for example, RBC Intf.,
Blasts and so on) with a processor having a CPU thereby displaying
a message that may contain abnormal conditions based on the result 
of judgment (see Japanese Published Unexamined Patent
Application No. HEI 2-304362).A method using a bar graph is available as one of general
methods for displaying measured data in such a manner that an operator
can easily understand what such data actually means. For
example, an automatic analyzer is known, which calculates a residual
amount of a sample or reagent and process it as a bar graph,
while a color is added to the bar graph and displayed when the
residual amount is found to be lower than a supply limit.
(see Japanese Published Unexamined Utility Model Application No.
HEI-5-26533).However, in accordance with the method described in
Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. HEI 2-304362,
a judgment is passed on each message by quantitatively
comparing measured data with a preset threshold. Such judgment
based on the quantitative comparison involves irrationalities such
that the test result is reversed because of a fine variation in the
measured data thereby failing to provide messages.That is to say, when measured data obtained by analyzing the
sample is compared with the threshold to express the measured
data in a binary value to display test result
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for displaying clinical test result information
on blood or urine, comprising :


input means (21) for inputting a set of measured data
obtained by analyzing a sample of a blood or urine, and a convertible threshold

level for judgment of the clinical test result information ;
calculating means (22) for selecting data out of the set of
measured data, and normalizing the selected data with respect to a

predetermined level;
display means (4) for displaying at least one normalized
value obtained by the calculating means (22) as a box-like graph, and said

convertible threshold for judging the clinical test result information as a partition
line on said box-like graph,
data processing means (24) for processing the data input
by the inputting means (21) in connection with the calculating means (22),
output means (25) for outputting the processed data to the
display means (4).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said calculating
means (22) includes a fuzzy reasoning means or a neural network.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said calculating
means (22) normalizes said selected data with respect to the predetermined level

to a value ranging from 0 to 1 in using said fuzzy reasoning means or neural
network.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said display
means (4) further displays said normalized value as a character.
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said display
means (4) displays said character and said box-like graph by changing the color

of the character and of the graph when the normalized value exceeds the
convertible threshold.
