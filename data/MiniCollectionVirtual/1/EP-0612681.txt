<ABSTRACT>
A sheet overlapping detecting method for use with sheets of 
unstable density includes the following steps. Light is 

radiated through a sheet of paper by N light emitting means 
and detected by N light detecting means, respectively, which 

generate a corresponding signal. The maximum light intensity 
signal is then selected and compared with each remaining N-1 

signals to generate corresponding difference values 
associated with each N-1 signal respectively. The difference 

values are then compared with a predetermined value 

d and 
the corresponding light intensity signals of all difference 

values which exceed this value are rejected. The average 
value Dr of the remaining light intensity values is then 

calculated and compared with a prestored overlapping 
determination value to determing whether overlapping of 

sheets has occurred.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet 
overlapping detecting method for use in particularly a 
sheet-fed press. Conventionally, when sheets (sheets of paper) are 
to be fed to a sheet-fed press, overlapping of the sheets 
of paper to be fed is detected. That is, when a sheet of paper is to be fed from 
a feeding apparatus to a sheet-fed press (to be referred to 
as simply a press hereinafter), the leading edge of the 
sheet of paper is brought into contact with a stopper 
called a front guide provided at the press-side distal end 
portion of a feeding table, and then the sheet of paper is 
fed to the press. In this case, in order to prevent two or 
more overlapped sheets of paper from being simultaneously 
fed, a light-emitting device is arranged at the rear 
surface side of the feeding table in a position close to 
the front guide, and a through hole is formed in a 
predetermined portion of the feeding table corresponding to 
a light-emitting portion of the light-emitting device. In 
addition, a light-receiving device is arranged at the upper 
surface side of the feeding table corresponding to the 
through hole. That is, light emitted from the  
 
light-emitting device is radiated in the direction of 
thickness of a sheet of paper to be fed, and transmission 
light transmitted through the sheet of paper is received by 
the light-receiving device and converted into an electrical 
signal to obtain a received light amount. An output level 
corresponding to the received light amount is compared with 
a predetermined determination level, and overlapping of 
sheets of paper is detected on the basis of the comparison 
result. In this case, a light emission amount of light 
emitted from the light-emitting device and the 
determination level are preferably set to be optimum values 
for a corresponding sheet of paper. That is, the 
relationship between the light emission amount and the 
output level obtained when the number of sheets or paper is 
one is different from that obtained when the the number of 
sheets of paper is two. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, a 
characteristic curve I is obtained for one sheet of paper, 
and a characteristic curve II is obtained for two sheets of 
paper. In this case, the optimum value of the light 
emission amount is a light emission amount value at which a 
difference between output levels based on the 
characteristic curves I and II becomes maximum. The 
optimum value of the determination level is 1/2 a sum of 
the output levels based on the characteristic curves I and 
I

determining the maximum output level of said plurality of light 
receiving means (22-1,22-2) corresponding to received light intensities;
