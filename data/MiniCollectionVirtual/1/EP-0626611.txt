<ABSTRACT>
A photographing box is arranged to reduce a time taken 
from photographing an object to printing the image of the 

object. The photographing box is intended to be manufactured 
at low cost and more easily maintained. The photographing 

box includes a photographing mechanism house for 
housing a photographing mechanism and a photographing space 

section. If paid, the photographing device is operated to 
illuminate an object, photograph the object, and do some 

image processing like image magnification or reduction or 
image layout. Plural images sized to some ways of use are 

output on one cut sheet by a sublimation transfer printer. 
The photographing box operates to print out the image at 

high speed, and print it out, and is manufactured at low 
cost and is more easily maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographing box
which includes a photographing mechanism for taking the
steps of photographing an object such as a figure, perform
the necessary processing of the video signal, and print out
the picture according to the charges given by a user, and
a thermal transfer recording apparatus which is intended
to be used as one of several possible ways to the automatic
photographing boxes.It has been conventionally known an instant photographing
system such as a silver photo system or a diffusing
transfer type silver photo system as means for
outputing a printed picture for about a few minutes.
The silver photo system needs a few minutes consumed from
the end of the photographing to the output of the printed
photo and to provide a developing solution and a fixing
solution for doing wet process. The system therefore has
to do a troublesome operation of exchanging the solutions
and maintaining the relevant equipment. Further, since the
atmospheric temperature is greatly effected on the image
quality, the temperatures of the solutions are required to
be minutely controlled. The diffusing transfer type silver
photographing system needs to do a very costly running
process.FR-A-2 665 812 discloses an automatic photograph booth for the taking and
development of photographs, comprising an adjustable seat, electronic video
camera, payment means provided with keyboard, and a TV monitor, wherein the
signals representing the colour portrait produced by the electronic video camera
are momentarily stored in a memory, and wherein the keyboard permits the user
through the pressing of command buttons to view one or more images on the
screen of the TV monitor and select his most preferred image for printing by a
thermal printer.US-A-4 864 410 also discloses an apparatus for making photographs from a video
image similar in principle to the one disclosed in FR-A-2 665 812, which includes
in one embodiment a controlled lighting system.JP-A-01 166 969 discloses a thermal printer system including a control unit 1,
which on one hand stores in a memory data relating to the values of resistance per
heating element and on the other hand judges whether an abnormal value exists
in the values of resistance per heating element stored in the memory.EP-A-0 506 144 discloses a sublimation transfer printer comprising a colour
corrector, a gradation corrector, a storage unit, a parallel-to-serial convertor and a
printing unit with which a high precision and high quality colour hard copy very
similar to the
