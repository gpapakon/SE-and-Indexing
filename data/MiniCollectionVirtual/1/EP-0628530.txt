<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acetylene
derivatives useful as an ingredient of ferroelectric
liquid crystal compositions, a process for producing
the same,
liquid crystal compositions containing said acetylene derivatives as
active ingredient, and liquid crystal elements using
said liquid crystal compositions.At the present time, TN (twisted nematic) type
displaying methods are most widely employed in the field
of liquid crystal elements. TN liquid crystal elements
have many merits such as lowness in driving voltage,
smallness in consumption of electric power, etc. In the
point of response speed, however, the TN liquid crystal
elements are inferior to luminescence type display
elements such as cathode tube, electroluminescence, 
plasma display and the like. Although a new TN type
display element in which the angle of twist is altered
to 180° to 270° has been developed, it is still
insufficient in response speed. In spite of such
endeavors for improvement as the above, a TN type
display element having a high response speed is not yet
realized. However, there is a possibility of marked
improvement in response speed in the new displaying
method using a ferroelectric liquid crystal which is
energetically being studied in the recent time (Clark et
al.; Applied Phys. Lett., 36, 899 (1980)). This method
uses a chiral smectic phase exhibiting a
ferroelectricity such as chiral smectic C phase
(hereinafter, abbreviated to Sc*), etc. It is known
that the phase exhibiting a ferroelectricity is not
limited to Sc* phase, but chiral smectic F, G, H and I
phases and the like also exhibit a ferroelectricity.Ferroelectric liquid crystal materials used in
practical ferroelectric liquid crystal elements are
required to have many characteristic properties. At the
present stage, such requirements cannot fully be
satisfied by a single compound, but a ferroelectric
liquid crystal composition obtained by mixing together a
number of liquid crystal compounds or (non-liquid
crystal) compounds must be used for satisfying such
requirements.A ferroelectric liquid crystal composition can
be obtained not only by using a composition composed of 
ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds alone. Thus, it
has been reported in JP-A-61-195187 that a ferroelectric
liquid crystal composition, as a whole, can be obtained
by using a compound and composition showing non-chiral
smectic C, F, G, H, I phases, etc. (hereinafter,
abbreviated to Sc phase, etc.) as a fundamental
substance and mixing thereinto one or more compounds
showing ferroelectric liquid
