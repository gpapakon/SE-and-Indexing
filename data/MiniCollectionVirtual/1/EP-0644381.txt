<ABSTRACT>
Ventilation apparatus 1 installed in a ceiling structure 3 has a horizontal deflector plate 
13 located below the outlet 6 of a duct 4. The plate 13 has vanes 14 inclined from the vertical 

at an angle of about 45° and spaced from one another by channels 15 through which air can 
flow. The deflector plate 13 is rotatably mounted by bearings 11 around its edge and is driven 

by an electric motor 20 or turbine 30 to rotate the deflector plate slowly about a vertical axis 
so that air is swept about the vertical axis 7.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ventilation apparatus of the kind including a deflector mounted 
in a ceiling structure at the outlet of an air duct. Ventilation in many buildings is carried out through ducts extending above the ceiling 
panels within the building. Air is expelled from the duct through grills mounted in the ceiling. 
This can result in poor overall ventilation because of the localised nature of the outlet grills. In 
particular, regions immediately below the grill may be draughty whereas regions remote from 
the grill may be inadequately ventilated. Although the grills can be provided with angled 
louvers to deflect airflow, this does not entirely overcome the problem. It is an object of the present invention to provide improved ventilation apparatus. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided ventilation apparatus 
of the above-specified kind characterised in that the deflector is mounted for rotation about a 
vertical axis such that air flowing through the deflector is deflected away from the vertical axis, 
and that the apparatus includes a drive for rotating the deflector about the vertical axis so that 
air emerging from the deflector is swept about the axis as it is rotated. The drive may include an electrical motor, which may be mounted axially of the 
apparatus. Alternatively, the drive for rotating the deflector may include a turbine driven by air 
emerging from the duct. The apparatus preferably includes a plurality of bearings at the outer 
edge of the deflector. The deflector is preferably a plate with a plurality of vanes inclined from 
the vertical and separated from one another by channels through which air can flow. The vanes 
may be inclined at an angle of about 45° to the vertical and the deflector may be rotated at a 
rate of approximately 10 rpm. The apparatus may include a fan mounted between the deflector 
and the outlet of the duct and a heater arranged to heat air emerging from the apparatus.  Ventilation apparatus according to the present invention, will now be described, by way 
of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1is a simplified sectional side elevation of the apparatus; Figure 2is a plan view of the apparatus from above; Figure 3is a simplified sectional side elevation of alternative 
apparatus; and Figure 4is a simplified sectional side elevation of a further modified form of the 
apparatus. The ventilation apparatus 1 is mounted in a circular opening 2 in a horizontal ceiling 
panel 3. A duct 4
