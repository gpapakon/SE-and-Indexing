<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to rechargeable 
batteries which include cell casing components (11, 12) 

enclosing positive and negative plates, separator 
ma
terial and acid electrolyte. The battery includes a 
plurality of support members (65) extending from one or 

the other of the casing components, or from both casing 
components, the support members passing through the 

plates to permit uniform compression of the internal 
components. In its preferred embodiment, the battery 

includes one or more intermediate cell partitions (40) 
which permit stacking of individual cells to increase 

voltage. The partition (40) continues the utilization of 
the support members. In another disclosed embodiment, 

the electrode plates contained within any particular cell 
are punched to permit the support members (65) to pass 

therethrough, with hole sizing selected so that a small 
hole (105) will remain at each support location, while 

also insuring that for each support member, only one of 
the positive and negative plates will touch it, but not 

both. Shorting along the support member is thereby 
prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field 
of lead-acid batteries and more particularly to 
relatively flat, rechargeable batteries of the 
recombinant variety. Still more specifically, the 
present invention relates to structures for building 
higher voltage batteries from individual battery cells 
without interwall redundancies and for preventing 
shorting within the individual cells along support 
members contained therein. Small rechargeable batteries are becoming 
increasingly important with the continuing development of 
portable electronic appliances, such as uninterruptible 
power systems (UPS). The batteries which are used with 
such devices are frequently referred to as flat pack 
batteries. It is highly desirable that such batteries be 
compact and light in weight yet have a high storage 
capacity. Advances have been made in this technology in recent 
years, even using conventional lead-acid battery 
technology. Lead-acid batteries suffer from  
 
disadvantages relating to the weight of the plate 
materials (lead plates and lead-containing active 
materials) and the weight of the containers which are 
required to hold the plates and electrolyte. Lead-acid 
batteries, however, have very good power delivery 
characteristics and may be repeatedly recharged and even 
overcharged, with only minimal damage to the cells. 
Moreover, the power curve of lead-acid batteries is 
relatively predictable. Such features are not readily 
achievable with other batteries, such as nickel cadmium 
batteries. One type of lead-acid battery is the recombinant 
battery which differs from conventional lead-acid 
batteries (for example, automobile batteries) in that 
there is no flowing electrolyte in the system. 
Substantially all of the electrolyte is maintained in 
separator material, typically made of a glass fiber mat, 
located between the plates. The gasses evolved during 
the electrochemical reactions which take place in lead-acid 
batteries are absorbed and recombined within the 
battery rather than being vented in the normal case. 
With such systems, the battery can be sealed and made 
maintenance free. Other recombinant systems still use 
valves to relieve any undesirable build-up of pressure 
within the cells of the battery. One particularly important development in the field 
of recombinant lead-acid batteries is described in United 
States Patent No. 4,996,128 issued December 26, 1991 to 
Aldecoa and Miller entitled "Rechargeable Battery" 
(hereafter, the "'128 patent"). The battery described in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rechargeable battery (10) of the type 
including: 

   a first end casing (11), a second end casing (12), 
and characterized by at least one partition 

(40) located between the end casings, the 
abutment of two adjacent partitions or a 

partition and a casing resulting in the 
creation of a cell; 

   battery electrode elements, separators and 
electrolyte located within each cell; 

   the casings and partitions being sealed along each 
abutment; and 

   a plurality of support members (65) for maintaining 
a constant spacing between the electrode elements within 

each cell, the support members being attached to at least 
one of a partition or a casing and passing through the 

electrode elements. 
The battery of claim 1 further characterized in 
that each partition (40) includes a flat plate (42) and a 

wall (44) surrounding the plate and extending from both 
side of the plate. 
The battery of claim 1 further characterized in 
that a plurality of spaced-apart, elongate support 

members (65) extend from one side of the plate (40) and a 
plurality of spaced-apart receivers (72) are located on 

the other side of the plate (40), the receivers being 
constructed and ar
ranged to receive the ends of support 
members from another partition. 
The battery of claim 3 further characterized in 
that a plurality of spaced-apart receivers are located on 

one of the casings (11, 12) and are constructed and 
arranged to receive the ends of support members (65) from 

a partition (40). 
The battery of claim 1 further characterized in 
that the electrode elements include positive (80) and 

negative electrode (75) plates and separators (83) 
therebetween, the electrode plates comprising conductive 

foil substrates pasted respectively with positive and 
negative active material. 
The battery of claim 5 further characterized in 
that the plates are punched to create openings to receive 

the support members (65) and wherein the size of the 
openings (105, 107) is selected so that each support 

member (65) will contact one polarity of plate, but not 
both. 
The battery of claim 6 further characterized in 
that the openings for each polarity of plate include 

smaller openings (105) and larger openings (107), the 
openings being arranged such that when plates of opposite 

polarity are placed adjacent one another but separated by 
separator material (83), a small hole (105) of one 

polarity plate will be aligned with a larger opening hole 
(107) on the plate of opposite polarity. 
A battery cell of the type including a casing

will be aligned with a larger opening hole (107) on a 

plate of opposite polarity.
