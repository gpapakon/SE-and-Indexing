<ABSTRACT>
A drive circuit for a strain sensor includes a Wheatstone 
bridge (5) having semiconductor strain gauges (1-4). A 

temperature-dependent voltage generator (10) generates a 
voltage having a predetermined ambient temperature dependency 

characteristic, a constant voltage generator (11) 
generates a predetermined constant voltage, and a proportional 

voltage generator (12) generates a voltage proportional 
to an externally supplied power source voltage 

(V
CC
). A voltage processor (13) receives and arithmetically 
processes output voltages of the temperature-dependent 

voltage generator (10), the constant voltage generator (11) 
and the proportional voltage generator (12) to generate a 

bridge drive voltage (V₁₃) which changes from a mid value 
to a predetermined voltage depending on a temperature 

proportional to the power source voltage. In an amplifier 
circuit for amplifying a strain output signal from the 

Wheatstone bridge, both the potentials across an AC coupling 
capacitor are kept to be equal at a steady-state 

operation. Detection sensitivity variations due to the 
temperature dependency characteristic of the strain gauges 

can be effectively compensated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a strain sensor using semiconductor
strain gauges for converting a mechanical strain
into an electric signal as well as a drive circuit and an
amplifier circuit for the same strain sensor, and more
particularly to a strain sensor, which includes compensation
means for compensating for the temperature dependency
of the output voltage in the absence of signal and also
compensation means for compensating for the temperature
dependency of the detection sensitivity, as well as a drive
circuit and an amplifier circuit for the same strain sensor.Strain sensors are finding various industrial applications
for converting various physical quantities such as
forces, displacements, vibrations, shocks, pressures, etc.
into electric quantities. Particularly, strain sensors
using semiconductor strain gauges are finding rapidly
increasing applications in pressure measurement, acceleration
measurement, etc. because they are capable of making
mass production, price reduction and size reduction since 
the circuit formation, shape processing and batch processing
involved can be carried out all by semiconductor processing.
Further, since it is possible today to carry out
signal analysis inexpensively by using microcomputers, the
applications have expanded to such fields as various control
processes, in which a microcomputer reads out the
strain sensor output signal as a digital signal through an
analog-to-digital (AD) converter and executes analysis of
the signal.A strain sensor, in which semiconductor strain gauges
utilizing the piezoelectric resistance effect of semiconductor
are used as strain sensor elements, has high detection
sensitivity and enables to make size reduction and
mass production by using semiconductor processing. On the
demerit side, however, the detection sensitivity varies
greatly with temperature. In addition, the output voltage
in the absence of signal is subject to great variations
with temperature. Hitherto, there have been proposed
various methods of compensation for such characteristic
variations with temperature.A known method of converting strain into electric
quantity with a Wheatstone bridge having semiconductor
strain gauges, will now be described with reference to Fig.
1. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a Wheatstone bridge
5 having semiconductor strain gauges 1 to 4. In this 
Wheatstone bridge circuit, the semiconductor strain gauges 1
to 4 are arranged such that with a strain given to each of
them the resistances of the strain gauges 2 and 3 are
changed
