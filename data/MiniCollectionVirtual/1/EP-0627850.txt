<ABSTRACT>
In order to facilitate pupil distance adjustment, diopter adjustment and 
convergence adjustment, in a spectacle type display arrangement which utilizes a 

pair of image generating units (25) for projecting images on left and right eyes 
respectively, a pair of shafts (5) are installed in a housing (10) by way of a frame, 

and a pair of lens and mirror units (21) are reciprocally mounted on the shafts (5) 
so as to movable toward and away from each other. A slide plate (32) which forms 

part of a backlight (30) is disposed on the frame so as to be slidable in the 
fore-and-aft direction. A pair of shafts (36) are disposed one above the other at the 

upper and lower portions of the backlight. A pair of LCD holders (24) which form 
a part of the pair of image source means are supported on the shafts so as to be 

laterally movable toward and away from each other. A pupil distance adjustment 
of the pair of image generating means is implemented by a rotation of a knob (8) 

through cam (40) and link (50) mechanisms, while a diopter adjustment and a 
convergence adjustment are simultaneously implemented by a rotation of a knob 

(9) through a separate cam mechanism (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
spectacle or goggle type display device. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a
spectacle or goggle type display device which enables a
wearer to observe an electronically produced image, such
as that produced in response to a video or television
signal, in addition to his or her surroundings (viz., the
outside view), and which includes an improved adjustment
arrangement whereby both pupil distance and diopter
adjustment can be easily implemented.The applicant has previously proposed spectacle or
goggle type display devices which enables the monitoring
of a video image and the like and which use LCD. An
example of such a display device is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application No. 3-251667 (JP-A-05-091582). One of
these arrangements will be briefly discussed with
reference to Figs. 27 and 28. In the illustrated
arrangement, 100 denotes a spectacle type display device,
which includes goggle-type housing or body 101, and a
pair of bows or temples 102, 102 foldably mounted on
either sides of the housing 101. An inverse V-shaped
reflector 103 is mounted on an inverse V-shaped nose pad
portion 101a at a lower center portion of the housing
101. A fluorescent tube 104 is arranged above the
reflector 103, while a pair of vertically arranged
transparent type color liquid crystal panels (image
display means) 105, 105 are disposed on either side of
the reflector 103. A convex converging lens is arranged
in intimate contact with each of the color liquid crystal
panels 105 via a deflection plate 107. A pair of convex ocular lenses 108, 108 are arranged
in the housing 101 in front of the left and right eyes A,
A, respectively. A pair of rectangular reflection
mirrors 109, 109 is arranged in the housing 101 between a
pair of converging lenses 106, 106 and a pair of ocular
lenses 108, 108.In Fig. 28, 102a denotes earphones which are
attached to each bow 102. The front side of the housing
101 is opaque. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 27, a pair
of rectangular ocular window portions 101b, 101b open at
the rear face side of the housing 101. The pair of
ocular window portions 101b, 101b are covered with a
transparent window plates, respectively, for protecting
the ocular lens 108, 108 and the other elements which are
arranged in the housing 101, from dust or the like type
of contamination.As shown in Fig. 28, when the above described
spectacle type display device 100 is worn by a user, an
image which is produced by the pair of color liquid
crystal panels 105, 105
