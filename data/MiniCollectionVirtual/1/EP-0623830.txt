<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
waveplate for use in an optical communication system, a
method of manufacturing the optical waveplate, and a
waveguide device using the optical waveplate.Recently, various methods have been proposed
for transmission of a large quantity of information
stably and inexpensively. An optical communication
system is one of these methods. A representative
example of this optical communication system is a method
(wavelength division multiplexing system) in which light
components having a plurality of wavelengths and
carrying their respective signals are multiplexed into
single light by a multiplexer and transmitted to a
remote place through an optical fiber. The light is
demultiplexed into the light components with their
original wavelengths by a demultiplexer upon reception,
thereby detecting the individual signals. This method
can increase the communication capacity in proportion to
the multiplexing number of wavelengths and is therefore
a very effective method of increasing the capacity.
This method also can reduce the load on hardware in an 
optical communication network connecting a number of
points and makes a more advanced network arrangement
possible by using a combination of a plurality of light
wavelengths, multiplexers, and demultiplexers in
addition to spatial wiring.A system of the above sort requires a light
source which oscillates at a plurality of wavelengths,
and a multi/demultiplexer for
multiplexing/demultiplexing light. As the
multi/demultiplexer, a device using PLCs (Planar
Lightwave Circuits) consisting of optical waveguides
formed on a substrate has been developed as the most
realistic device from the point of view of a small size,
a light weight, and a high reliability. Of these PLCs,
a silica-based PLC fabricated by depositing a silica
glass film on a silicon substrate is expected as a
practical optical component, since it has a small
optical loss and consequently a high stability against
disturbance such as heat or vibrations.The most serious problem in putting the
silica-based PLC into practical use is its polarization
dependence. That is, as mentioned above, this
silica-based PLC is manufactured by depositing a glass
film on a silicon substrate. Therefore, the difference
in thermal expansion coefficient between the glass film
and the silicon substrate makes a stress applied on an
optical waveguide in a direction parallel to the surface 
of the substrate differ from that in a direction
perpendicular to the substrate surface. Consequently,
the
