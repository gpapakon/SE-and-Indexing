<CLAIMS>
Anti-theft device for eye glasses, comprising a 
flexible link (7) arranged to form a closed loop over a 

bridge (21) of a mounting of eyeglasses, containing reinforcement 
means (8,46,50) against cutting, and a plate (1) 

having means for hanging on a display support and having 
means which are only releasable with a specific locking tool, 

for fastening one of the ends of the link if the otherend 
is permanently fixed to the plate and the two ends together 

in the contrary case. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
link (7) is of flexible material and contains a reinforcement 

cable or wire. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said fastening means comprise a pin (22) fast with a magnetizable 

part, movable between a locking position in which the 
pin engages the link and prevents removal of the link, toward 

which it is biased by a spring (23) and an unlocking position 
in which it permits removal of the link 7), towards which it 

is moved when said part is subjected to a magnetic field 
generated by said specific tool. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said fastening means comprise a pin (30) fast with a button, 

movable between a locking position, into which it can be 
moved by a pressure on the button and in which it engages the 

link and prevents removal thereof, and an unlocking position 
in which it permits removal of the link, toward which it is 

biased by a spring and said fastening means comprise a 
magnetizable locking means movable between a locking position 

in which it maintains the pin in engaged position and an 
unlocking position where it is brought when it is subjected 

to the action of a magnetic field. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
link is U-shaped and comprises an inner element of plastic 

material for contact with the bridge and outer metal clamp  
 

(45,50) for reinforcement and in that the plate comprises a 
slot for receiving the two end portions of the link, one of 

which is formed with holes or with a rack cooperating with 
said fastening means. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
said clamp (50) is longer than the inner element and formed 

with the holes or with the rack. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
said inner element (42) is longer than the clamp (45) and is 

formed with the holes or the rack, the length of the clamp 
being such that the portion of the inner element that remains 

uncovered out of the slot is substantially zero.
