<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection pump is proposed, which has an injected fuel quantity adjusting element (4), which is actuated by a speed lever (5, 16), which is adjustable against the force of a control spring (19) as a function of a force generated according to the engine speed, the control spring (19) being arranged between the speed lever (5, 16) and an adjusting lever (20), which can be adjusted by a swivelling control lever (22) and is supported fixed to the housing and with an idling spring (8), which in addition to the control spring (19) is coupled to the speed lever (5, 16) and is clamped between the latter and an idling spring adjusting lever (9), fixed to the housing and supported on a shaft (10), which idling spring adjusting lever can be shifted by a setting lever (11) connected to the shaft (10), which setting lever is capable of swivelling between two adjustable stops (23, 24, 33, 36) and can be set by an actuating device as a function of operating parameters of the internal combustion engine. The setting of the idling spring is adjustable by way of a coupling arrangement, according to a shifting of the control lever (22) between a minimum idle setting and a maximum idle setting. The actuating device comprises a return spring (26) acting on the setting lever (11) and the coupling arrangement, by means of which the setting lever (11) is coupled non-positively to the control lever (22) in such a way that the setting lever (11) follows the adjustment of the control lever (22) in the swivelling range between the two stops (23, 24, 33, 36).

Fuel injection pump for internal combustion 
engines, with a fuel injection quantity adjusting member 

(4) actuated by a governor lever (5, 16) which is adjustable 
counter to the force of a regulating spring (19) in 

dependence of a force formed in dependence on the engine 
speed, the regulating spring (19) being arranged between 

the governor lever (5, 16) and an operating lever (20) 
which is adjustable by means of a pivotable adjusting 

lever (22) and which is mounted fixedly relative to the 
housing, and with an idling spring (8) which, in addition 

to the regulating spring (19), is coupled to the governor 
lever (5, 16) and which is clamped between the latter and 

an idling spring operating lever (9) which is mounted 
fixedly relative to the housing on a shaft (10) and which 

is adjustable by means of a setting lever (11, 111) which 
is connected to the shaft (10) and is pivotable between 

two adjustable stops (23, 24, 33, 36) and which can be 
set in dependence on operating parameters of the internal 

combustion engine by means of an actuating device, 
characterized in that the actuating device consists of a 

return spring (26, 126) engaging on the setting lever 
(11, 111) and of a coupling arrangement, by means of 

which the setting lever (11, 111) is coupled non-positively 
to the adjusting lever (22), in such a way 

that, in the pivoting range between the two stops (23, 
24, 33, 36), the setting lever (11, 111) follows the 

adjustment of the adjusting lever (22). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the coupling arrangement consists of a  

 
drag lever (30, 130) which is pivotable about a fixed 

axis (31, 131) and which is coupled to the setting lever 
(11, 111) via a take-up part (28, 40) provided eccentrically 

to the pivot axis of the setting lever (11, 111) 
formed by the axis of the shaft (10) and can be brought 

to bear against the adjusting lever (22) under the effect 
of a return force. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the take-up part (28, 40) is fixedly 

connected to one of the parts, namely the drag lever (30, 
130) or setting lever (11, 111), and is guided on a cam 

(29, 39) on the other of the parts, namely the setting 
lever (11, 111) or drag lever (30, 130). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the cam (29) has two mutually parallel 

guide tracks, between which the take-up part (28) is 
guided. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the take-up part (28, 40) is held under 

the effect of a return spring (26, 126) in bearing 
contact against the cam consisting of a cam track (29, 

39). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the cam has a rectilinear path. 
Fuel injection pump according to one of Claims 3 
to 6, characterized in that the distance between the 

take-up parts (28, 40) and the pivot axis of the setting 
lever (11, 111) can be changed in order to change the 

transmission ratio between the adjustment of the adjusting 
lever and the adjustment of the setting lever. 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 4, characterized 

in that the guide tracks are formed by a long 
hole (29) which is arranged in the drag lever (30) in the 

region between the pivot axis of the setting lever (11) 
and the axis (31) of the one-armed drag lever (30). 
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the drag lever (131) is a two-armed lever 

and by a return spring (43) can be brought with one arm 
into bearing contact against the adjusting lever (22),
