<ABSTRACT>
A digital television system (10) is provided. System (10) may receive a 
video signal at composite video interface and separation circuit (16). The 

video signal is separated into component form by composite video interface 
and separation circuit (16). The component video signals are converted to 

digital component video signals in analog to digital converter circuit (18). 
Line slicer (14) divides each line of digital component video signal into a 

plurality of channels such that each channel may be processed in parallel by 
channel signal processors (22a) through (22d). Each channel signal processor 

(22a) through (22d) may provide two lines of output for each line of video 
input. The processed digital component video signals may be formatted for 

displays (26a) through (26c) in formatters (24a) through (24c). Each 
formatter (24a) through (24c) may comprise a plurality of first in-first out 

buffer memories (34a) through (34j). One of each channel signal processors 
(22a) through (22d) may be coupled to two of first in-first out buffer memories 

(34a) through (34j). Additionally, each formatter (24a) through (24c) may 
comprise channel data format units (38a) through (38d), each associated with 

a channel of, for example, display (24a). Channel data format units (38a) 
through (38d) are coupled to appropriate of first in-first out buffer memories 

(34a) through (34j) via multiplexers (36a) through (36d). Each formatter 
(24a) through (24c) may remove overlap between channels of system (10) and 

may format the processed video signal into appropriate channels for displays 
(26a) through (26c).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of electronic devices.
More particularly, this invention relates to video data formatter for a digital
television system.A digital television system is described in European Patent Application
No. 94116984, published as EP-A-0 651 577 and assigned to Texas Instruments Incorporated.In designing the digital television system
a heretofore unrecognized problem was
discovered. The digital television system may comprise a plurality of
processing channels each containing a predetermined number of pixels. Each
channel may overlap by, for example, one to five pixels with an adjacent
channel for processing purposes. Additionally, the display of the digital
television system may have a number of channels having a different pixel
width from the processing channels such that the channels of the display are
incompatible with the processing channels. The teachings of the present
invention relate to a system and method for formatting video data for a
digital display of a digital television system.More specifically, the present invention provides a video data
formatter having a plurality of input channels, comprising
the features of claim 1.
The invention further provides a method of formatting
video data comprising the steps of claim 13. It is a technical advantage of the present invention to provide a video
data formatter for a digital television system that removes overlap between
adjacent channels before a processed video signal is displayed. The digital
television system processes a video signal in a plurality of parallel channels.
The channels of the system may correspond to vertical strips of a video frame.
Each channel may contain an overlap of, for example, one to five pixels with
an adjacent channel. The overlap between channels may allow horizontal
processing of pixels on the end of a channel. The overlapping pixels may be
removed before the processed video signal is displayed such that redundant
pixels are not displayed.It is another technical advantage of the present invention to reformat
the processed video data for a display. The display may have a plurality of
associated channels that differ in pixel width from the processing channels.
The processing channels may be altered to match the pixel without the
channels of the display.It is another technical advantage of the present invention to provide
one bit plane of data for each bit of video data associated with a pixel to a
display of a digital television system. The display may provide 2x intensity
levels
