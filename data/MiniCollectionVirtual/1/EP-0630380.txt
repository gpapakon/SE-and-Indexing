<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods of reducing the E-(trans) isomer amount in the Z/E (cis/trans)
7-amino-3-(1-propen-1-yl)-3-cephem- -4-carboxylic acid of formula I
The Z-isomer, 7-amino-3-[(Z)-1-propen-1-yl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid of formula Ia

is a central intermediate for the production of highly effective broad-band antibiotics, for
example cefprozil and BAY v 3522 of formulae
It is known that the Z-(or cis-)configuration represents the characteristic which determines the
advantageous antibacterial properties of cephalosporin end products in the Gram negative 
range. Consequently, an active substance with the smallest possible proportion of E-(or trans-)
isomer is desired for optimum efficiency. For example the undesired E-isomer in cefprozil
should not exceed 11% according to the US Pharmocopeia.Synthetic processes for the production of these antibiotics generally yield Z-isomers in
admixture with E-isomers.During the synthesis of the double bond from the corresponding cephalosporin nucleus by
means of a Wittig reaction with acetaldehyde, the ratio of Z- to E-isomers may only be guided
in the desired direction to an unsatisfactory extent: UK Patent Application 2 135 305
describes the production of cefprozil, starting with 7 -[D-2-(t-butoxycarbonylamino)-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid benzhydrylester. In Procedure 8
of this UK Application, the trans-isomer is separated by high performance liquid chromatography.In USP 4 727 070, a Z/E mixture of 7-[D-2-amino-2-(Z-and E)-1-propen-1-yl)ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic
acid (cefprozil) is freed from undesired E isomer by means of a reaction with
acetone and subsequent re-cleavage to the active substance. Purification of a most advanced
intermediate by chromatography is expensive, and purification by chemical derivation of the
end product is of course the most expensive variant.Less expensive is the production of the relatively isomer-free intermediate product, namely
7-amino-3-[(Z)-1-propen-1-yl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. However, the necessary
olefinization reaction may not progress sufficiently selectively to the desired Z-compound. For
example, in UK Patent Application 2 173 798, 7-amino-3-(1-propen-1-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid benzhydryl ester.hydrochloride is obtained for example as a
maximum 90/10 Z/E mixture in a Wittig reaction as an intermediate stage to the antibiotic
cefprozil. From this, ester cleavage takes place to produce
7-amino-3-[(Z)-1-propen-1-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with a proportion of Z-isomer of
9.7
