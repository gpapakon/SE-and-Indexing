<ABSTRACT>
The conveying device is used for the further transport of flat products (4), fed one by one, such as envelopes, printed products or workpieces, and has a drawing element (6) which circulates and is driven, to which are fastened at intervals pick-up devices (5,40) which may be filled and emptied. The pick-up devices (5,40) each have two side walls spaced apart in the conveying direction, which form a pick-up space (9) having an opening (11,49) for the products (4). The opening (11,49) can be expanded for loading. For dropping (the objects), the pick-up devices (5,40) can be moved in each case into a suspended position which exhibits a predetermined inclination, in which position the openings (11,49) point downwards and the products (4) can be dropped through the latter.

Conveying device for the further conveyance of flat 
products (4) fed one by one, such as pocket envelopes, 

printed products or workpieces, comprising a continuously 
driven traction member (6) to which receiving devices (5; 

40) which can be loaded and unloaded are secured at 
intervals, the receiving devices (5; 40) each having two 

side walls (7; 8; 41, 43) arranged at a distance from one 
another in the conveying direction and forming a receiving 

chamber (9) with an opening (11; 49) for loading and 
discharge of the products (4), characterised in that the 

openings (11; 49) can be expanded for loading and for 
discharge the receiving devices (5; 40) can each be moved 

into a suspended position with a predetermined inclination, 
in which the said openings (11; 49) point downwards and the 

product (4) can be discharged through this opening (11; 
49). 
Conveying device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one side wall (8; 43) is movable and 

preferably pivotable about an axis (10; 42) extending 
transversely to the conveying direction in order to expand 

the said opening (11; 49). 
Conveying device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the receiving devices (40) each 

have a closure element (44) by means of which the opening 
(49) can be closed after loading. 
Conveying device according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the closure element has a movable flap (45). 
Conveying device according to claim 4, characterised in  
 

that the flap (45) can be moved away from the opening (49) 
for loading. 
Conveying device according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the closure element (44) can be controlled for release 

of the opening (49) and discharge of the product (4). 
Conveying device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that respective locking devices (50) are 

applied laterally to the side walls (41; 43), by means of 
which the opening (45) can be controllably held in an 

expanded and in a narrow position. 
Conveying device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the receiving devices (5; 40) are 

constantly inclined relative to the conveying direction 
compared to the traction member (6). 
Conveying device according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the traction member (6) is a link 

chain and that the receiving devices (5; 40) are each 
secured to one link (75) of the chain. 
Conveying device according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the chain links (75) each have four rollers (71 to 74) 

which are rigidly mounted relative to one another in a 
substantially non-offset manner as viewed in the running 

direction.
