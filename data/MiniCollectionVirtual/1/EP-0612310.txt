<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the manufacture of 
cinnamic acid derivatives which, owing to their UV-B absorbing 
properties, are suitable as UV-B filters for cosmetic agents, e.g. 
sunscreen agents. R.F. Heck in Org. Reactions, vol. 27, chapter 2, pages 345-389 
(1982) describes, inter alia, the preparation of cinnamic acid 
derivatives by reacting haloaromatics with acrylic acid derivatives in 
the presence of palladium compounds as homogeneous catalysts and of 
bases, e.g. secondary or tertiary amines. Disadvantages of this 
reaction are, that the for the most part expensive homogeneous 
palladium catalysts can not be recovered in a simple manner after the 
reaction and that the reaction time is relatively long. For example, a 
68 percent yield of methyl pmethoxycinnamate is achieved after 5 hours 
when p-iodoanisole is vinylated with methyl acrylate in the presence of 
palladium acetate and tri(n-butyl)amine [see also R.F. Heck and J.P. 
Nolley, Jr., J. Org. Chem. 37, 2310 (1972)]. US Patent No. 4 970 332 also describes the reaction of piodoanisole 
(and other palkoxyiodobenzenes) with alkyl acrylates in order to 
prepare corresponding cinnamic acid derivatives. In this case, the 
reaction is carried out in the presence of a heterogeneous palladium 
catalyst (palladium on a carrier material) and a trialkylamine and the 
palladium catalyst can be recovered by filtration. However, as in the 
above Heck process, the reaction time is relatively long, for example 2 to 
4 hours in the preparation of 2ethylhexyl pmethoxycinnamate. A 
further disadvantage is that the process is limited to the use of 
trialkylamines as the bases. The object of the present invention is to carry out such 
alkenylations more rapidly, with higher yields and with a wider choice  
 
of amines. This object has surprisingly been achieved by carrying out 
the reaction of the haloaromatic with the acrylic acid derivative inter 
alia in the presence of an alkanoic acid ammonium salt formed from 
an alkanoic acid and a primary, secondary or tertiary amine as defined 
in more detail hereinafter. The process in accordance with the invention for the manufacture 
of a cinnamic acid derivative of the general formula
