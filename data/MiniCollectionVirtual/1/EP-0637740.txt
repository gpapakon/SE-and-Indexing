<ABSTRACT>
Device for filling a container (R) by lowering it on to a needle (5) which pierces it. The parts of the installation adjacent to the bottom of the container (R), which might be contaminated by premature ejection of liquid from the needle, are washed and dried by nozzles (27, 28, 29) for washing the regions potentially effected by such ejection, as well as the needle (5) itself; then drying is undertaken using suction orifices (38). Application to transporting radioactive liquids for the purposes of analysis.

<CLAIMS>
Device for filling a receptacle (R) including: a filling liquid elevator
(4) ended by a needle (5) for piercing a bottom (F) of the receptacle; a

sheath (12) having a bottom (14) constituted by a wall (15) pierced in front
of the needle (5) and mobile towards the needle and being connected to a network

of pipes (9, 10) for carrying the receptacle by pneumatic means; and a
boat (23) situated in the sheath and disposed so as to suspend the receptacle

(R) slightly above the bottom (14) of the sheath, characterized in that the
sheath (12) is equipped with nozzles (27, 28) for sprinkling washing liquid

towards the bottom (F) of the receptacle suspended in the boat and towards
the internal face (31) of the wall of the bottom of the sheath.
Filling device according to claim 1, characterized in that some of the
nozzles (27) are oriented in such a way so as to sprinkle the bottom of the

receptacle obliquely and produce a rebounding of the washing liquid from the
bottom of the receptacle towards the internal face of the bottom of the

sheath.
Filling device according to claim 2, characterized in that some of the
nozzles (28) are oriented tangentially to the bottom of the receptacle, the

height of the bottom (F) of the receptacle and an adjacent portion of the
receptacle.
Filling device according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that some of the nozzles (27, 28) are oriented in such a way so as to

sprinkle the internal face (31) of the bottom of the sheath obliquely and
produce there a vortex of the washing liquid.
Filling device according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the sheath is equipped with at least one nozzle (29) for sprinkling

liquid towards the needle.
Filling device according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the sheath is equipped with means (35 to 38) for drying the bottom

(F) of the receptacle (R) and internal face (31) of the wall of the bottom 
(14) of the sheath (12).
Filling device according to claim 6, characterized in that the drying
means consists of suction means driven by a compressed air circuit (20)

provided with a static partial depression creation device (35).
