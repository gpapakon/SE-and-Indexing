<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition which comprises a 
novel phosphatized alicyclic compound and a process for the preparation 
thereof. The composition of the present invention can be preferably used 
as an antigassing agent for a water-based coating composition containing 
metallic, for example, aluminum powder or flake, pigments for coating 
automobile bodies, etc., a flame retardant for various resins and a water-based 
ink, and the like. It has been well known to incorporate metallic pigments in coating 
compositions, in particular it is an established practice to use aluminum 
flake pigments in compositions intended for the production of so-called 
"glamour" finishes on automobile bodies, whereby a differential light 
reflection is effected, depending on the angle at which the coated surface 
is viewed. Generally speaking, such coating compositions have been 
solvent-based, in common with the other coating compositions employed in 
the automobile industry. The tend is growing, however, toward the use of 
water-based coating compositions due to the need to improve work 
environments and reduce pollution. For example, British Patent Specification No. 2073609 teaches a 
coating process in which a specified type of water-based base coat 
composition containing pigments, especially aluminum flake pigment is  
 
applied to a base surface, after which a transparent top coat composition 
is applied to the base coat. However, difficulties arise in incorporating metallic pigments, 
particularly aluminum or aluminum alloys, into water-borne coating 
compositions, because the pigment tends to react with water to produce 
hydrogen. This leads to problems, especially if compositions are stored in 
closed containers. Ways have been proposed to minimize or prevent this "gassing effect" 
, most involving some form of chemical treatment of the metallic pigment to 
render it less reactive toward the aqueous medium of the coating 
composition. It is known that ortho-phosphoric acid is effective for this 
purpose, but its presence in coating compositions leads to unacceptably 
poor humidity resistance in films derived from them. Alkyl esters of phosphoric acid can overcome the problem to a limited 
extent, but their use involves an unsatisfactory compromise between the 
inhibition of gassing and a tendency toward deteriorating mechanical 
properties in the derived coatings, in particular poor adhesion between the 
base coat containing the agent and the transparent top coat. The same is true of
