<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing at least one unwanted organic compound from a natural extract. This process consists in subjecting the extract (at 1) to an irradiation by means of a laser beam (4), the wavelength of which corresponds to an absorption band of the unwanted compound (compounds) for transforming the latter into a compound (compounds) which is (are) acceptable and/or easily separable from the extract. By means of this process, it is possible to remove the thujones from a sage extract, to treat a mixture of phycobiliproteins in order to destroy the phycoerythrin or the phycocyanin, or to treat an extract of bergamot in order to remove the bergapten (bergaptene).

<CLAIMS>
Process for the elimination of at least one unwanted, organic compound
from a natural extract, characterized in that it consists of

subjecting the extract to an irradiation by means of a laser beam,
whose wavelength corresponds to an absorption band of said unwanted

compound or compounds in order to transfer the said compound or compounds
into non-unwanted and/or easily extract-separable compound or

compounds.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the unwanted
compound is a ketone.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the unwanted
compound is thujone.
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that the extract is
a sage extract.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the unwanted
compound is a phycobiliprotein.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that the unwanted
compound is phycocyanine or phycoerythricine.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the extract is
a bergamot extract.
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the unwanted
compound is bergaptene.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in
that the extract is dissolved or diluted in a solvent before being subject

to laser beam irradiation.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that irradiation is performed at a temperature below ambient
 
temperature, but above the solidification temperature of the extract

subject to irradiation.
Process according to any one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that it comprises a complimentary stage of separating the compound

or compounds obtained by irradiating the unwanted compound or compounds.
Process according to claim 11, characterized in that said separation
takes place by evaporation.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the extract is
irradiated by circulating it in an irradiation container traversed by

the laser beam and in that the elimination of the unwanted compound or
compounds is controlled by measuring the energy of the laser beam which

has traversed the irradiation container.
Process according to any one of the claims 1, 5 and 6, characterized
in that irradiation takes place at a wavelength corresponding to

the flank of the absorption peak of the unwanted element in order to
obtain the best destruction selectivity.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 14, characterized
in that the extract is an extract of aromas and that the irradiation

treatment makes it possible to modify the olfactory rating of the
extract.
