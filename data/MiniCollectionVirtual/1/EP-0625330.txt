<ABSTRACT>
A suction cleaner for sawdust has a dust container (13), in which a dust-collecting bag (24) can be accommodated, and a filter housing (28) which is arranged thereon such that it can be pivoted away and contains a cartridge filter (40) with an associated cleaning device. The filter housing (28) comprises the uncleaned-air inlet connecting piece (31) and a clean-air outlet connecting piece (37). On the clean-air side a fan (20) is connected. A pivot bearing arrangement (17) acting on one side with a relieving device (80) ensures easy and motionally damped opening of the container.

<CLAIMS>
Sawdust suction device with a blower (20) located on the clean air side 
and a cartridge filter (40), which is located in a filter housing (28), which 

is provided on a dust container (13) receiving a dust collecting bag (24), the 
filter housing (28) containing an integrated cartridge filter cleaning device 

(47), characterized in that the filter housing (28) is mounted so as to be 
outwardly pivotable. 
Suction device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cartridge 
filter cleaning device (47) contains optionally radially adjustable rapping 

elements (49), which are provided on the cartridge filter inside exposed to the 
untreated air and preferably the rapping elements (49) are fitted to a shaft 

(48) rotatable preferably in both rotation directions central with respect to 
the cartridge filter (40) optionally by means of a crank provided on the lid 

(35) of the filter housing (28) and/or have at least one brush (51), which acts 
on the folds (42) of the cartridge filter (40) constructed as a bellows filter 

for the vibrating movement thereof and/or act on the cartridge filter (40) in 
two different circumferential action directions and for which purpose they are 

positioned preferably substantially radially to the cartridge filter (40), in 
particular the at least one brush (51) is resiliently connected to the shaft 

(48) and optionally held in a brush holder (53), which is resiliently fitted to 
a brush carrier (50) and preferab
ly the brush carrier (50) is a rod fitted to 
the shaft (48) and to whose end is applied one end of a helical spring (55), 

whose other end is applied to a connecting piece (54) on the brush carrier (50). 
Suction device according to claim 2, characterized in that several, preferably 
three brushes (51) staggered in the axial direction of the cartridge 

filter (40) are provided in such a way that they simultaneously act on the same 
fold (42). 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that a protective screen (75) is provided on the clean air suction opening 

leading out of the filter housing (28). 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the filter housing (28) with the untreated air inlet opening (31) provided 

thereon can be tilted by means of a ball and socket joint (17) into an open  
 

position, in which it is located over a blower section (14) of the device (11) 
containing the blower (20) and its drive motor (62). 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized by 
a weight relief device (80) acting during the pivoting out of the filter 

housing (28) and which preferably operates with at least one spring element 
(81) and in particular has a backlash in the vicinity of the pivoted out position 

of the filter housing (28). 
Suction device according to claim 6, characterized in that the relief 
device (80) has a lever (83) fitted to the suction device (11) and preferably 

two levers (83) on each side of the dust container (13), from whose end the 
spring element (81) optionally constructed as a tension spring, extends to a 

fixing point (82) on the filter housing (28) and in particular the lever (83) 
is pivotably mounted on the suction device (11) for creating the backlash. 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that a ball and socket joint (17) of the filter housing (28) has two lateral 

joints, whose position with respect to the filter housing (28) is adjustable, 
preferably vertically and horizontally and preferably braced links (59) between 

the filter housing (28) and joint (17) are length-adjustable, the ball and 
socket joint (17a) more particularly on pivoting the filter housing out of the 

vertical into its pivoted position moves its effective pivoting axis in the 
direction of the centre of the dust container (13) and/or in each case has two 

rocking levers (70), which are in each case articulated by one side to a fixed 
part (71) relative to the dust container (13) and with the other side to the 

filter housing (28) and preferably the articulation points of both rocking 
levers (70) in the unpivoted state of the filter housing (28) are displaced 

horizontally against one another. 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the filter housing (28) comprises an intermediate ring (26) containing the 

untreated air inlet (31) and mountable in sealed manner on the dust container 
(13) and a cup-shaped housing part fittable in sealed manner to its other side 

and containing the filter cartridge (40), the cleaning device (47) and the 
clean air outlet (76).  

 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that to the lower portion of the dust container (13) is connected a suction 

line (19) connected to the suction side of the blower (20). 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the dust container (13) has an upper sealing edge (23), which sealingly 

cooperates with the filter housing (28) and the intermediate position of an 
opening rim of the dust collecting bag (24) drawn over the sealing edge (23). 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that within a clean air line (37, 38) leading from the filter housing (28) to 

the blower (20) there is a measuring line (67) passing from the clean air zone 
(46) of the filter housing (28) to a vacuum measuring device (66). 
Suction device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the blower (20) is a radial fan with a vertical shaft, into which substantially 

vertically and centrally issues the clean air line (38) and/or the 
blower (20) and its drive motor (62) is surrounded by a casing (64) internally 

lined in sound absorbing manner and into which issues the blower outlet (63).
