<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the preparation 
of mono-olefins by catalytic dehydrogenation of 
paraffinic hydrocarbons. In particular, the invention 
concerns certain improvements of industrial dehydrogenation 
processes for the preparation of mono-alkenes from corresponding 
alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms. The general reaction scheme in those processes can 
be expressed by the equilibrium reaction 
 
   which is thermodynamic unfavourable towards formation 
of alkenes. Because of the high energy required to 
cleave a C-H bond, the reaction takes place at high temperature 
with extensive thermocracking and combustion of 
hydrocarbon feed. To minimize formation of by-products at 
desired production rates, industrial dehydrogenation processes 
employ catalysts, which allow the above equilibrium 
reaction to proceed at lower temperatures. Catalysts, 
conventionally used in the processes, are supported platinum 
catalysts, or catalysts comprising chromic oxide 
impregnated on activated alumina and platinum-tin-zinc 
aluminate in form of cylindrical or spherical pellets. An essential process variable in the catalytic 
dehydrogenation process is pressure. Since the process is 
thermodynamically limited, reduced pressure results in 
increased equilibrium conversion. Thus, a higher alkene 
concentration can be obtained when removing gaseous hydrogen 
from the process gas leaving reaction (1). Oxidative hydrogen removal from dehydrogenated or 
oxygenated hydrocarbon feed in presence of a catalyst or a 
hydrogen retention agent is known in the art. Removal of hydrogen by contact with a dehydrogenation 
catalyst being capable of adsorbing hydrogen is 
mentioned in EP 543,535. At the disclosed process, the feed 
is contacted with the catalyst above 500°C and  
 
hydrogen being formed during dehydrogenation is adsorbed on 
the catalyst. Catalysts, being able to adsorb hydrogen, are 
reducible metal oxides selected from Group IB, IIB and VIII 
of the Periodic Table. The hydrogen adsorbed on the catalyst 
is, subsequently, removed by applying heat, vacuum or 
by contact with an oxygen containing gas. Dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in separate beds of 
a dehydrogenation catalyst or in intermediate beds with a 
hydrogen selective oxidation catalyst is mentioned in US 
4,599,471 and US 4,739,124. During the above processes, a 
dehydrogenated effluent stream from a bed of dehydrogenated 
catalyst is reheated and hydrogen is removed by passage 
through a subsequent bed of the hydrogen selective 
oxi
