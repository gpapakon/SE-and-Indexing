<ABSTRACT>
A 3D projection display comprises an autostereoscopic image producing 
means (22-27) which directs light beams corresponding to respective 2D 

views in different directions towards a projection lens (28). The 
projection lens (28) co-operates with the image producing 
means (22-27) 
to image the light beams at respective different regions (30) in the 

aperture of the projection lens (28). A light-transmissive screen co-operates 
with the image producing means (22-27) and the projection lens 

(28) to image the views at the screen. The screen may comprise a 
Fresnel lens (29) or where a magnified image of increased angular spread 

is required, a double lenticular screen angular amplifier (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a three-dimensional (3D) projection
display apparatus.Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a known large screen 3D
display comprising a plurality of projectors 1, each of which projects an
image representing a two-dimensional (2D) view. The output light
beams of the projectors 1 are directed to an auto-collimating lenticular
array 3. The 2D views are imaged at the array 3 and the light beams
from the projectors are directed in different directions by the array 3 such
that each eye of an observer 4 sees a different 2D view across the whole
of the array 3, thus creating an autostereoscopic 3D image. Similar
displays are disclosed in: "Survey of three dimensional television", James
F. Butterfield, page 40 Proc. SPIE vol. 212 Optics and Photonics Applied
to Three Dimensional Imagery (1979); and "Electronic Registration for an
Autostereoscopic Lenticular 3D TV on a CRT: An equivalent of a
Varifocal lens for an electronic 3D display", M. Okada, J. Hamasaki, S.
Utsunomiya, O. Takeuchi, First International Symposium on 3D Images
(Paris 26-28 September, 1991).A display of this type can provide a large 3D image, for instance of
about 1 metre diagonal size, but requires a relatively large number of
projectors in order to provide an acceptable number of 2D views. Such
a display is therefore prohibitively bulky and expensive. Further, without
the use of expensive anamorphic correcting optics in the projectors 1, 
such a display suffers from keystone distortions between the projected
images. Alternatively, real time electronic correction for keystone
distortions may be necessary.Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings shows another known type of
projection 3D display using a single projector comprising a light source
(not shown), a spatial light modulator (SLM) 5, and a projection lens 6.
A plurality of spatially multiplexed 2D views is formed by the SLM and
projected via the projection lens 6 on to a lenticular screen 7. However,
in order to provide a large display with an adequate number of 2D
views, the SLM 5 is required to provide a spatially multiplexed image
having a resolution which is greater than can be provided by currently
available devices. Further, very accurate control of registration of the
images with respect to the lenticular screen is required which, in turn,
requires a very well corrected projection lens 6. A similar type of system
is disclosed in "50 inch autostereoscopic full colour 3D TV display
system", Isono, Yasuda, Takemori, Kanayama, Yamada & Chiba,
