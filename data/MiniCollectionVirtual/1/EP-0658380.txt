<ABSTRACT>
The device for separating dust particles from exhaust gases has a surface (edge) filter (2) arranged in a filter housing (1). A precharger (4) installed in the exhaust line (3) upstream of the filter housing (1) serves to charge the dust particles before they reach the surface filter (2). The precharger (4) is designed as a self-contained constructional unit. The precharger (4) comprises at least two lattice-shaped electrodes (8, 9) which extend approximately plane-parallel to one another and are aligned transversely to the exhaust gas stream. The electrodes are connected to a high-voltage source (12) connected on one side to earth. By means of these measures, the dust particles are precharged in an optimum manner and, by virtue of their charge, are deposited in the form of a loose, porous and hence gas-permeable layer on the surface filter without the need to have additional electric fields there. Locating the precharger in the exhaust line upstream of the filter makes it unnecessary to provide a knocking and cleaning device in the precharger owing to the high flow velocities prevailing at that point.
