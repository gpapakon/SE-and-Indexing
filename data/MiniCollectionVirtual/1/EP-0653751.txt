<ABSTRACT>
A disk transport mechanism for moving disks into a disk-player 
transports disks between an eject position and a playback or storage 

position inside the disk-player. The tray passes through an opening in the 
disk-player when it moves from the eject position to the playback or 

storage position. The disk transport mechanism carries the disk on a tray 
with a circular recess which locates the disk precisely in the tray. A disk 

improperly placed in the tray, so that it rests on a ridge around the 
circular recess, could cause damage when the tray passes through the 

opening. To prevent this, the transport mechanism abruptly accelerates the 
tray during movement into the disk-player by momentarily halting or 

reversing a drive motor of the disk transport mechanism. The acceleration 
of the tray causes any improperly mounted disk to fall into the circular 

recess before the disk can jam in the opening, thereby preventing injury 
to the disk or the disk-player.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disk players for playing disk-shaped
media (for example, compact disks). More particularly, the present
invention relates to disk players that carry the recorded media on a carrier
with a recess and that convey the carrier between a playback or store
position, where the disk is played back, and an eject position, where the
carrier is presented for the user to exchange disks.Disk playback devices are known that carry disks on a carrier
having a recess for locating the disk with respect to the carrier. Such
carriers are transported by an automatic transport mechanism from an
internal position to an eject position. In the eject position, a disk can be
placed in the carrier. The disk and carrier can then be conveyed from the
eject position to a storage location in the disk player for storage, or to a
playback position for playback. The disk carrier has a recess which
correctly locates the disk when the disk is placed in the recess while the
carrier is in the eject position. If a disk is not properly placed in the
carrier and the transport mechanism activated to transport the disk into the
playback device, the disk can become caught between the edges of an
opening in the playback device and a carriage holder of the transport
mechanism. Damage to the disk or the player could result.To prevent damage to a incorrectly loaded disk, a mechanism
could be provided to forcibly shift the disk to its correct position before
the disk and carriage are transported into the player. However, such an
additional mechanism would increase the cost of production of the disk
player. An object of the present invention is to provide a disk playback
device that overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.Another object of the present invention is to provide a disk
playback device that protects disk media from damage during transport in
the disk playback device.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a disk
playback device that is low in manufacturing cost.Briefly, a disk transport mechanism for moving disks into a disk-player
transports disks between an eject position and a playback or storage
position inside the disk-player. The tray passes through an opening in the
disk-player when it moves from the eject position to the playback or
storage position. The disk transport mechanism carries the disk on a tray
with a circular recess which locates the disk precisely in the tray. A disk
improperly placed in the tray, so that it rests on a ridge around the
circular recess, could cause
