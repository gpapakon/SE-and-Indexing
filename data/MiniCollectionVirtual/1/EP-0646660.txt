<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a carrier for surface 
plasmon resonance analysis (SPR) in which a metallic 

film comprising a layer of silver is deposited on a 
surface characterised in that after the silver layer 

has been deposited the film is subjected to an 
annealing step in which it is heated to a temperature 

sufficient to anneal it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of carriers for surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR). Surface plasmon resonance or (SPR) is a technique 
which can be used in the analysis of antibodies which 
are deposited on surfaces which have been coated with 
thin films of silver. SPR based sensors are discussed 
in a paper by I Faulkner, W R Flavell, J Davies, R F 
Sunderland and C S Nunnerly : "SPR-based sensors 
studied by electron energy loss spectroscopy and 
attenuated total reflection" - to be published in J 
Electron Spectroscopy, 1993. The manner in which a 
coating is applied to a surface has important 
consequences for the subsequent properties of that 
surface in terms of SPR and control of the coating 
process is important. At present coating is generally 
performed by spattering but control is not good. It 
is important that the films are formed from uniform 
layers of metal in order to get reproducible SPR. On 
account of this improved methods for the production of 
films for SPR are desirable. According to the present invention we provide a 
process for the production of a carrier for SPR 
analysis in which a metallic film (preferably thin) 
comprising a layer of silver is deposited on a surface 
characterised in that after the silver layer has been 
deposited the film is subjected to an annealing step 
in which it is heated to a temperature sufficient to 
anneal it. In the annealing step the film is annealed 
effectively in order to bake it and thereby to orient 
the film and enhance its physical properties.  
 In operation of the process of the invention the 
surface, which is suitably a glass surface, is 
preferably subjected to an appropriate pre-treatment 
before the silver layer is laid down upon it. A 
suitable pre-treatment comprises the steps of 
cleaning, treatment by reactive glow discharge and 
thereafter deposition of a preparatory metallic layer. 
The preparatory metallic layer is preferably thin. 
The silver layer is then deposited on the preparatory 
layer. After the silver layer has been deposited it 
is annealed. The annealing step is carried out effectively to 
bake the metallic film. It has the effect of 
orienting the film and enhancing its physical 
properties. Suitably annealing is effected by infra 
red heating in a chamber. The preferred period is in 
the range 1.5 to 4 hours. The preferred temperature 
is in the range 125° to 175°C. A temperature of 150° 
is especially preferred The annealing temperature is 
important when SPR is to be used to analyse the
