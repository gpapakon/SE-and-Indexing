<ABSTRACT>
The prism spectrometer of the "Littrow" type with a double beam path has an essentially W-shaped beam path, so that the entry gap and the image plane can have a larger spacing from each other and components which are arranged there do not impair the beam path or the aperture ratio. Two halves of a concave mirror are designed as a collimator or as focusing optics, between the prism arrangement and the concave mirror there is provided a lens arrangement for correcting spherical aberrations and/or coma. The prism device can be a prism achromat formed from prism wedges.

<CLAIMS>
An imaging prism spectrometer consisting of:

an entrance slit (1),
a collimator which is formed by the first half of a concave mirror (2, 22.1),
a prism device (4, 24),
a plane mirror (5, 25) disposed obliquely to the beam path,
an optical focusing element which is formed by a second half of the concave mirror
(2, 22.2), and
a focal plane (7, 27);

having a passage of the beam which is doubled by the prism device, wherein a beam
which is incident through the entrance slit is subjected to parallel alignment by

means of the collimator formed by the first half of the concave mirror, subsequently
passes through the prism device for the first time, is reflected behind the prism

device by a plane mirror which is aligned obliquely to the beam path in such a way
that the beam passes through the prism device a second time in a direction which

differs from its first passage and is subsequently focused on to the focal plane via
the optical focusing element formed by the second half of the concave mirror,

wherein a W-shaped beam course is produced as a whole, 
characterised in that
the prism device (4, 24) is fixed,
that a single lens system (3, 23) for the coma-free correction of spherical aberration is
disposed between the prism device (4, 24) and the concave mirror or concave mirrors

(2; 22.1, 22.2) in the middle region of the W-shaped beam which travels forwards and
backwards, in such a way that the optical axis of the lens system (3, 23) runs

symmetrically to the different directions of the beam which travels forwards and
backwards, and
that a detector array is disposed in the focal plane (7; 27).
A prism spectrometer according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the two halves (22.1;
22.2) of the concave mirror are separated and are disposed inclined in relation to each

other. 
A prism spectrometer according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a tilted mirror
(6, 26) of convex curvature is disposed between the entrance slit (1, 21) and the part of

the concave mirror (2; 22.1) which serves as the collimator.
A prism spectrometer according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the
prism device (4) is an achromatic prismatic lens formed from two prismatic wedges.
