<ABSTRACT>
A display apparatus for a bicycle has a display panel (3). The display panel 
(3) includes a plurality of rear speed stage display sections (21-28) for displaying 

a speed stage of a rear derailleur. The rear speed stage display sections are 
formed of a plurality of sets of display elements. The display panel further 

includes a plurality of front speed stage display sections (29a-29c) for displaying 
a speed stage of a front derailleur. Each of the front speed stage display 

sections includes one set of display elements. An indicating device is provided 
for controlling one of the display elements in one set, thereby to indicate the 

speed stages of the front derailleur and rear derailleur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display apparatus for a bicycle for
displaying speed stages of a front derailleur and a rear derailleur.A conventional display apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
Kokai No. 63-90490, for example. This apparatus includes one liquid crystal
display having an analog display window for displaying a speed stage of a front
derailleur and an analog display window for displaying a speed stage of a rear
derailleur. Each display window displays a speed stage by blacking display
elements forming the display window. That is, a speed stage of the front
derailleur is displayed by the display elements acting exclusively as means for
displaying the speed stage of the front derailleur, and an indicating device
exclusively for blacking these display elements. A speed stage of the rear
derailleur is displayed by the display elements acting exclusively as means for
displaying the speed stage of the rear derailleur, and an indicating device
exclusively for blacking these display elements. A similar display apparatus is disclosed in DE-A-3 732 815.In conventional practice, therefore, the display of a speed stage of the front
derailleur is indicated by its own indicating device, while the display of a speed
stage of the rear derailleur is indicated by its own indicating device. The
display of speed stages of the front and rear derailleurs requires two indicating
devices. Many or complicated devices are required to control the two indicating
devices, resulting in the disadvantage of high manufacturing cost. An object of the present invention is to provide a display apparatus for a
bicycle which allows the rider to perceive speed stages of both a front derailleur
and a rear derailleur by looking at one display plane, and which may be
manufactured with advantages in terms of construction and cost.The above object is fulfilled, according to the present invention, by a display
apparatus for a bicycle comprising a display device (or display panel) including
a plurality of rear speed stage display sections for displaying a speed stage of a
rear derailleur, a plurality of front speed stage display sections for displaying a
speed stage of a front derailleur, and an indicating device. The rear speed stage
display sections are formed of a plurality of sets of display elements. Each of
the front speed stage display sections includes one set of display elements. The
indicating device controls one of the display elements in one set, thereby to
indicate the speed stages of the front
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A display apparatus for a bicycle comprising display means including:

rear speed stage display sections for displaying a speed stage of a rear
derailleur, said rear speed stage display sections being formed of a set of

plurality of rear speed stage display elements (21-28);
a plurality of front speed stage display sections (29a-29c) for displaying a
speed stage of a front derailleur;
indicating means;
characterized in that
each of said front speed stage display sections includes one set of said rear
speed stage display elements (21-28); and said indicating means operates

one of said display elements in one set, thereby to indicate the speed stages
of said front derailleur and said rear derailleur, whereby
each of said front speed stage display sections is formed as a display array, a
plurality of display arrays being staggered relative to one another, and
said display arrays are arranged such that, where the display elements in
one display array substantially and vertically align to those in another

display array, these display elements display substantially the same wheel
driving gear ratios.
A display apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
display elements in one set are arranged in order of wheel driving gear

ratios.
A display apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
display elements in one set are formed of liquid crystal elements in a

colorless state, said indicating means indicating speed stages of said front
derailleur and said rear derailleur by coloring one of said display elements. 
A display apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
display elements in one set are formed of liquid crystal elements in a colored

state, said indicating means indicating speed stages of said front derailleur
and said rear derailleur by changing one of said display elements to a

colorless state.
