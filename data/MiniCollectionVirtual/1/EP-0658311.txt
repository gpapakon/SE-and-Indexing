<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a device for removing the skin from the bodies or body parts of slaughtered poultry. The device comprises a skin-entraining roller (2) with a sharp surface area (13) and a press-on shoe (4) with a cutter which is arranged such that a gap is left between it and the surface area (13). Situated above the cutter (3) is an auxiliary conveyor (5) comprising at least one rotational body (19, 20) which is driven in the opposite direction to the skin-entraining roller (2) and has a ridge (21, 22) which rises up over its periphery and is coiled.

Device for the removal of skin from the carcasses of slaughtered 
poultry or from parts of such carcasses, with a rotationally driven 

skin entraining roller (2) with gripper circumferential surface (13), 
a planar knife (3) which lies opposite the circumferential surface 

(13) by its cutting edge (18) while leaving a gap, a presser shoe 
(4), which is arranged behind the cutting edge (18) in rotational 

direction of the skin entraining roller (2), with a presser surface 
(16) forming a gap (17) relative to the circumferential surface (13), 

and with an auxiliary conveyor (15) which comprises at least one 
rotationally driven body of rotation (19, 20), the axis of rotation 

of which extends substantially parallel to the axis of the skin 
entraining roller (2) and which has a web (21, 22) wound in screw-shape 

at its circumference, characterised thereby that the auxiliary 
conveyor (5) is arranged above the knife (3) and is displaceable away 

from this against spring or gravitational force. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
shell body of the body of rotation (19, 20) is a cylinder. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the 
shell body of the body of rotation (19, 20) is a conical frustrum. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characaterised thereby 
that the inclination and/or height of the screw-shaped web (21, 22) 

of the body of rotation (19, 20) is smaller than the largest width 
dimension and/or height dimension of the carcass or carcass part to 

be processed. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby 
that the auxiliary conveyor (5) comprises two bodies of rotation (19, 

20), wherein each is arranged to be displaceable on its own and 
wherein each body of rotation (19, 20) has a web (21, 22), which is 

wound in screw-shape, with a direction of winding oriented oppositely 
to the respective other body of rotation (19, 20).  

 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby 
that the crest surface of the webs (21, 22) is interrupted by grooves 

(28). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby 
that the screw-shaped web (21, 22) of each body of rotation (19, 20) 

ends in the region of its outflow end by a web part (23) which 
extends parallel and projects substantially radially relative to the 

axis of the body of rotation (19, 20). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised thereby that the feed 
equipment (1) comprises at least one driven belt conveyor (26) which 

is deflected in the immediate proximity of the circumferential 
surface (13) of the skin entraining roller (2) and the conveying 

surface of which is associated with guide rails (27) which are 
adjustable in pairs with respect to their spacing from one another 

and each form a guide channel which is oriented each time to guide in 
the outer region of each body of rotation (19, 20). 
Device according to claim 8, characterised thereby that the 
guide rails (27) are designed to additionally be adjustable in 

longitudinal direction.
