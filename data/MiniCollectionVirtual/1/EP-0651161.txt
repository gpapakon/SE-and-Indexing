<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a device for cooling an 
electric motor for a turbo-fan unit. The motor has a shaft 

(16) which extends through the motor (10) and which supports 
a turbo-fan impeller (20) which is placed outside a shell 

(11) belonging to the motor. The turbo-fan impeller rotates 
with a speed above 50.000 rpm thereby creating a primary air 

flow which via an outlet (35) escapes from the turbo-fan 
unit. The turbo-fan unit (20) comprises means by means of 

which a secondary air flow is created which at least partly 
cools t
he electric motor and which from one or several 
cooling air inlets (28,30) separated from the primary air 

flow

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for cooling an
electric motor for a turbo-fan unit the motor having a shaft
supporting a turbo-fan impeller which is placed outside a
shell of the motor and which rotates with a speed which is
above 50.000 rpm thereby creating a primary air flow which
escapes from the turbo-fan unit via an outlet.Units of the type described above are shown in WO
94/15518 and WO 94/15519 resp. and are because of its small
dimensions suggested to be used as a vacuum source for vacuum
cleaners in particular for hand held appliances. Cooling of
the motor is in this case effected by directing the air flow
from the turbo-fan unit outside the electric motor before the
air escapes to atmosphere.It has however proved that this type of cooling -
because of the concentrated heat emittance in the internal
parts of the electric motor i.e. in bearings, rotor and
stator - is not sufficient to get an acceptable lifetime of
the electric motor.In order to improve the cooling effect it is of course
possible to let the complete air flow or a part of the air
flow created by the turbo-fan impeller pass the internal
parts of the motor but this is not desirable because the air
flow in certain applications is moisty and contaminated with
particles and thus could damage the motor. It is also a risk 
that a blocking of the air flow which could occur for
instance if the unit is used as a vacuum source in a vacuum
cleaner,means that cooling does not occur and this could
after a short period cause a motor breakdown.It is also previously known, see DE-A-3543833, to cool
electric motors for ventilators by providing the motor with
a seperate cooling air fan and surrounding the motor with a
chamber which is connected to atmosphere so that air can be
drawn outside the motor shell.The purpose of this invention is to achieve an
effective cooling of the electric motor at said type of
device the cooling being independent of the air flow through
the turbo-fan unit. This is achieved by means of a device
which has the caracteristics mentioned in the claims.Two embodiments of the invention will now be described
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1
and 2 show a vertical section through a turbo-fan unit
according to the two embodiments.With reference to Fig. 1 the turbo-fan unit comprises
an electric motor 10 which is surrounded by a motor shell 11
with a first and a second end wall 12 and 13 resp. each
having a hub part 14, 15 in which a shaft 16 is supported by
means of bearings 17. The electric motor is

<CLAIMS>
Device for cooling an electric motor (10) for a turbo-fan
unit the motor having bearings supporting a shaft (16)

which is provided with a turbo-fan impeller (20) placed
outside a first end wall (12) of a motor shell (11) and which

rotates with a speed above 50.000 rpm thereby creating a
primary air flow which escapes from the turbo-fan unit via an

outlet (35), 
characterized in
 that the device comprises a
cooling air fan (32) arranged at the same side of the motor

shell as the turbo-fan impeller (20) and by means of which a

secondary air flow is created which via one or several
cooling air inlets (28,30), separated from the primary air

flow, flows through the electric motor inside the motor shell
(11) thereby passing the bearings, the rotor the stator and

said end wall before leaving the shell via outlet openings
(31) through said end wall.
Device according claim 1 
characterized in
 that the
cooling air fan (33) is a radial fan.
Device according to claim 
characterized in
 that the
cooling air fan is a mainly flat plate.
Device according to any of claims 1-3 
characterized in
 that the turbo-fan impeller (20) and the cooling air fan (33)
are integrated to one unit the turbo-fan impeller being one

side of the unit whereas the other side facing the electric
motor is the cooling air fan.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,

characterized in
 that the secondary air flow by means of a
deflector plate is directed in mainly the same direction as

the primary air flow before the flows merge.
