<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging for medicaments, in particular to 
packaging for pre-pierced capsules of inhalation medicaments. The administration of inhalation medicaments in both liquid and dry powder 
forms are well known. Powdered inhalation medicament is often supplied in capsules 
which may be dispensed using e.g. the device known as the SPINHALERâ„¢. This 
device comprises a housing which retains an individual capsule of medicament, the 
capsule is pierced in situ thus releasing the medicament for inhalation. Such devices 
have the disadvantage that small fragments of the capsule may be produced during 
the piercing process which could be inhaled by the patient. Pre-pierced medicament capsules, i.e. capsules the walls of which are 
provided with one or more apertures during manufacture, are known. However, 
during storage such capsules may leak medicament through the apertures and 
hygroscopic medicaments may take up water due to ingress of moisture into the 
capsules. US-A-3,809,221 describes a conventional blister-pack according to the 
preamble of claim 1 which has a 
childproof polymeric backing sheet, such a pack would be totally unsuitable for pre-pierced 
capsules since it does not have sealing means for the capsule apertures. European Patent Application 0385156 (Phidea Srl) discloses a method of 
avoiding the problems associated with packaging pre-pierced capsules by providing a 
disposable inhaler containing a single pre-pierced capsule. However, this device 
suffers from the drawback that it may be necessary to carry several separate devices 
in order to provide a day's supply of medicament It is also wasteful, since the device 
cannot be refilled and is thus discarded after only one use. We have now devised an improved form of packaging for pre-pierced 
medicament capsules which is both effective and economical and which overcomes or 
substantially mitigates the problems described above. According to the present invention, there is provided a medicament pack 
comprising a base member having a plurality of blisters formed therein, each blister 
accommodating a medicament containing capsule, each capsule being provided with 
at least one aperture to permit medicament to be dispensed therefrom, characterised 
in that the base member comprises sealing means sealing the apertures.  
 The medicament pack according to the invention may be adapted to 
accommodate any practicable number of capsules, for example, enough to provide a 
day's, e.g. 4 doses, or a week's, e.g. 28 doses, supply of
