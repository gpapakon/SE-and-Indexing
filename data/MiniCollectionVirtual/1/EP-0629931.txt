<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatographic printer is described for forming an 
image onto a moving web (6) or sheet. The printer comprises a 

number of toner image-producing electrostatographic stations 
(A, B, C, D, E) having rotatable endless surface means in the 

form of a drum (21) onto which a toner image can be formed. A 
development station (4) forms a toner image on the drum (21). 

Drive rollers (22) convey the web (6) past the image-producing 
stations. Corona discharge devices (5) transfer the toner 

image on the drum surface onto the moving web (6). The printer 
includes an air-conditioning device comprising filters (30, 33) 

for removing dust and ozone from air leaving the environment of 
the image-producing station, a heat exchanger (34) and a 

humidifier (35) for adjusting the temperature and humidity of 
air leaving the environment of the image-producing station, 

thereby to produce conditioned clean air, and an inlet manifold 
(36) for introducing a stream of the conditioned clean air into 

the environment of the image-producing stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatographic printer for 
forming an image onto a moving receptor element, in particular 
to such a printer for forming multi-colour images on a paper 
web. An electrostatographic printing apparatus is intended for 
making a large number of prints and finds use, e.g., in the 
field wherein classical offset printing machines are applied 
for making thousands of prints in a single run. Electrostatographic printing operates according to the 
principles and embodiments of non-impact printing as described, 
e.g., in "Principles of Non-Impact Printing" by Jerome L 
Johnson (1986) - Palatino Press - Irvine CA, 92715 USA). Electrostatographic printing includes electrographic printing 
in which an electrostatic charge is deposited image-wise on a 
dielectric recording member as well as electrophotographic 
printing in which an overall electrostatically charged 
photoconductive dielectric recording member is image-wise 
exposed to conductivity increasing radiation producing thereby 
a "direct" or "reversal" toner-developable charge pattern on 
said recording member. "Direct" development is a 
positive-positive development. "Reversal" development is of 
interest in or when from a negative original a positive 
reproduction has to be made or vice-versa, or when the exposure 
derives from an image in digital electrical signal form,  
 
wherein the electrical signals modulate a laser beam or the 
light output of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). It is 
advantageous with respect to a reduced load of the electric 
signal modulated light source (laser or LEDs) to record graphic 
information (eg printed text) in such a way that the light 
information corresponds with the graphic characters so that by 
"reversal" development in the exposed area of a photoconductive 
recording layer, toner can be deposited to produce a positive 
reproduction of the electronically stored original. In high 
speed electrostatographic printing the exposure derives 
practically always from electronically stored, i.e. computer 
stored, information. A review of different toner development systems is given by 
Thomas L Thomson in I.E.E.E. Transactions on Electronic 
Devices, Vol ED 19, pp 495 to 511. The toner image obtained on a repeatedly used 
electrostatographic dielectric recording member is transferred 
onto a printing stock material, usually paper in the form of a 
web whereon the toner image is fixed, whereupon the web is cut 
into sheets containing the desired print frame. As can be learned from the book
