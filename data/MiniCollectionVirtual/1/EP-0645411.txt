<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a curing agent 
comprising a polyisocyanate compound obtained from 

hexamethylene diisocyanate and containing not more than 
0.5 % by weight of hexamethylene diisocyanate monomer, 

21 to 60 % weight of uretidine dione dimer and 11 to 40 
% by weight of isocyanurate cyclic trimer, the 

uretidine dione dimer and the isocyanurate cyclic 
trimer being prepared from a product obtained by 

urethane modification of 0.5 to 15 mole % by mole of 
total isocyanate groups of the hexamethylene 

diisocyanate by a dihydric alcohol having at least two 
hydroxyl groups and a branched hydrocarbon group having 

4 to 35 carbon atoms in the molecule, which the side 
chain hydrocarbon groups in the branched hydrocarbon 

group have 2 to 33 carbon atoms in total. The curing 
agent has a low viscosity and a good compatibility with 

a solvent, and can provides a polyurethane paint or 
adhesive composition having good curing property, 

drying property, adhesion strength and weathering 
resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curing agent 
comprising a polyisocyanate compound as the main 
component, the polyisocyanate compound containing a 
uretidine dione dimer and an isocyanurate cyclic trimer 
which are prepared from a product obtained by partial 
urethane modification of hexamethylene diisocyanate, 
which will be hereinafter referred to as "HDI", and 
paint and adhesive compositions containing the curing 
agent. In the fields of paints, coating and adhesive, 
larger resource saving, lower public nuisance and 
higher safety have been considerably required, and 
paints and adhesives of high solid type, powdery or 
aqueous system or hot melt type have been regarded as 
promising paints and adhesives with no public nuisance. 
Particularly in USA, paints and adhesives of high solid 
type are more and more used as measures to reduce VOC 
(volatile organic compounds). In Japan, conversion to 
the high solid type is not so remarkable as in USA, but 
use of the high solid type has been taken into 
consideration owing to recent activities of local  
 
self-governing bodies toward environmental protection, 
level-up of paints now in use by conversion to the high 
solid type, and furthermore trends to a guarantee of 
quality of, for example, USA-made cars and Japan-made 
cars in the automobile industry. Polyurethane paints and adhesives of one-package 
type and two-package type comprising an HDI-based 
polyisocyanate as a curing agent and acrylic 
polyol or polyester polyol as the main component have 
distinguished weathering resistance, chemical 
resistance, abrasion resistance, etc. and have been 
used in the fields of automobile and architecture outer 
coating and bonding. From the foregoing viewpoints 
even in such a polyurethane field a system of high 
solid type, in other words, low viscosity type, has 
been also required for reducing the necessary amounts 
of solvents for diluting the actual coating viscosity. 
Thus, an isocyanurate type has been recently more and 
more used owing to the good weathering resistance and 
the low viscosity as an HDI-based polyisocyanate curing 
agent rather than the urethane oligomer type based on 
polyfunctional alcohols. However, the isocyanurate type is in a 
structure of three molecules of HDI with a tendency to 
form a higher molecular weight compound and thus has a 
limit to formation of a lower molecular weight 
compound. To obtain a lower molecular weight compound,  
 
the structure must be a uretidine dione structure based 
on two molecules of HDI, and
