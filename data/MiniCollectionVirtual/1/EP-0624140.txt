<ABSTRACT>
When dispensing carbonated beverages, particularly beers and especially draught stout, it is desirable to obtain a close-knit creamy head. This contributes to a creamy taste and adds considerably to the customer appeal. To provide such a head a container (1) containing a carbonated beverage (13), includes a pod (6) located within the head space (14) above the level of the beverage (13) and containg a gas, the pod (6) including a hole (11) in its lower part above the level of the beverage (13) and means (12, 16) to ensure that only gas is discharged from the pod (6). The arrangement is such that when the container (1) is closed the pressures of the gas in the pod (6) and in the head space (14) are in equilibrium, but, as soon as the container (1) is opened to reduce the pressure inside the head space (14) of the container (1) the gas at super atmospheric inside the pod (6) is jetted out of the hole (11) and into the beverage (13) in the container (1) to cause shear of the beverage (13) and the liberation of small bubbles which accumulate in a surface layer on the beverage (13). When the beverage (13) is dispensed the small bubbles in its surface layer act to seed the generation of small bubbles throughout the remainder.

<DESCRIPTION>
When dispensing carbonated beverages, particularly 
beers and especially draught stout, it is desirable to 
obtain a close-knit creamy head. This contributes to a 
creamy taste and adds considerably to the customer appeal. 
Traditionally, such heads are only obtained when dispensing 
such beverages from draught. Another factor that 
considerably enhances the customer appeal is the way in 
which, when dispensing beverages, especially beers from 
draught, small bubbles are intimately mixed with the body 
of the beverage as it is dispensed and then, after dispensing 
is completed, the bubbles gradually separate out to 
form a close-knit creamy head. The formation of such small bubbles liberated throughout 
the body of the beverage during dispensing can be 
encouraged by causing shear of the liquid with resulting 
local pressure changes which causes release of small 
bubbles of controlled and uniform size. Over the years 
many proposals have been made to increase and control the 
liberation of such small bubbles and the generation of 
heads on beverages. Our own earlier specification GB-A-1,378,692 
describes the use of an ultrasonic transducer to 
subject the beer to shear immediately before it is 
dispensed into a drinking vessel and describes the way that 
by subjecting the initially dispensed portion of beverage 
to ultrasonic vibrations, the small bubbles released from 
this initial portion affect the remainder of the beverage 
by forming nucleation sites and triggering the generation 
of further small bubbles of controlled size. GB-A-1,266,351 describes a system for producing a 
draught type head when dispensing beer, or other carbonated 
beverage, from a container such as a can or a bottle. In 
the arrangement described in this specification the 
container includes a simple secondary chamber which is  
 
charged with gas under pressure either as part of the 
filling process in which the container is filled with 
beverage or by pre-charging the inner secondary chamber 
with gas under pressure. The secondary chamber includes a 
small orifice which is located beneath the surface level of 
the beverage in the container and the overall arrangement 
is such that, upon opening the container and so reducing 
the pressure in it, gas from the secondary chamber is 
jetted via the orifice into the beverage in the main body 
of the container so causing shear. This liberates the 
required small bubbles in the beverage which in turn act as 
nucleation sites during release of similar bubbles throughout 
the entire

<CLAIMS>
A container (1) containing a carbonated beverage (13), 
including a pod (6) located within the head space (14) 

above the level of the beverage (13) and containing a gas 
at a super atmospheric pressure, 

the pod (6) including a hole (11) in its lower part, 
characterised in that said hole (11) is located 

above the level of the beverage (13) and in that 
the pod comprises means (12, 16) to ensure 

that only gas is discharged from the pod (6), the arrangement 
being such that when the container (1) is closed the 

pressures of the gas in the pod (6) and in the head space 
(14) are in equilibrium, but, as soon as the container (1) 

is opened and the pressure inside the head space (14) 
of the container (1) is rapidly reduced to atmospheric 

pressure the gas at super atmospheric pressure inside 
the pod (6) is jetted out of the hole (11) and into the 

beverage (13) in the container (1) to cause shear of the 
beverage (13) and the liberation of small bubbles which 

accumulate in a surface layer on the beverage (13), so that when 
the beverage (13) is dispensed the small bubbles in its 

surface layer act to seed the generation of small bubbles 
throughout the remainder.  

 
A container according to claim 1, in which the means 
to ensure only gas is discharged comprises a tube (12) 

surrounding the hole (11) in the lower wall of the pod (6) 
and extending upwards towards the top of the container. 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, in which the 
hole (11) in the lower part of the pod has a diameter 

between 0.1 and 2.0 mm. 
A container according to claim 3, in which the hole 
(11) has a diameter of substantially 0.9 mm. 
A container according to any preceding claim, in which 
the pod (6) is formed from two parts which are snap-fitted 

together, or welded together. 
A container according to claim 5, in which the parts 
are fitted together in an atmosphere containing a inert 

gas.  
 
A container according to claim 6, in which the parts 
are fitted together after being dosed with a precursor of 

an inert gas such as dry ice or liquid nitrogen (30). 
A container according to any preceding claim, in which 
the pod (6) is attached to, or, at least held in place by 

a top closure (2) of the container. 
A container according to any preceding claims having 
the form of a glass bottle and the pod (6) substantially 

filling the head space in the neck (20) of the container 
(1) and being attached to a closure (22) of the bottle so 

that, upon opening the container the pod (6) is removed 
from the neck (20) of the bottle with the closure (22). 
A container according to any preceding claim having 
the form of a metal can (1), the pod (6) being either fixed 

to the lid (2) of the can (1) by adhesive or being held in 
place by being trapped in the seam formed between the lid 

(2) and the side wall of the can (1). 
A container according to claim 10, including a easy-open 
feature (3) such as a ring-pull or a stay-on tab (4) 

in which the pod (6) does not cover the entire under 
surface of the lid (2) and is arranged to be absent from a 

portion of the lid (2) immediately beneath the easy-open 
feature (4). 
A container according to claim 10, including an easy-open 
feature, in which the pod (6) is temporarily attached 

to the inside of the lid (2) by an adhesive which breaks 
down on contact with a beverage (13) or on the applicati
on 
of heat, for example, during a pasteurisation step, and in 

which the pod (6) is also connected to the container by a 
protruding lip (15) which is caught in the seam between the 

lid (2) and the side wall of the can (1) so that, upon 
opening the container the pod (6) can hinge about its 

protruding lip (15) to allow the pod (6) to be displaced 
from beneath the easy open feature (4) and thereby allow a 

beverage (13) to be dispensed from the inside of the can.
