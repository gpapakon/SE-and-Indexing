<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a
method of blocking cell adhesion molecules. In
particular, the present invention relates to a method of
blocking cell adhesion molecules with monoclonal
antibodies or synthesized substances.Cell adhesion molecules are surface proteins
that mediate cell binding, and the expression of these
molecules can promote the migration of leukocytes to areas
of inflammation. One of these cell adhesion molecules,
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),can be
expressed on the human cornea and retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE)(Elner, V.M. et al., Am. J. Path. (1991)
138:525-536; Kaminska, G.M. et al., Invest. Ophthalmol.
Vis. Sci. (1991) 32 (Supp):677; Forrester, J.V. et al.,
Curr. Eye Res. (1990) 9 (Supp):183-191). Lymphocyte
function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), a member of the
integrin family of cell adhesion molecules, is the counter
receptor for ICAM-1. In contrast to ICAM-1 which can be
expressed on several ocular tissues, LFA-1 is
predominantly expressed in leukocytes (Albelda, S.M. et
al., FASEB J. (1990) 4:2868-2880; Springer, T.A., Nature
(1990) 346:425-434). The interaction of ICAM-1 and LFA-1
is felt to be important in regulating and guiding the
migration of lymphocytes to sites of inflammation.
Another adhesion molecule, endothelial leukocyte adhesion
molecule-1 (ELAM-1), is expressed on the corneal
endothelium in endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) in the
Lewis rat (Whitcup, S.M. et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.
Sci. (1991) 32 (Supp):677). EP-A-0346078 discloses the therapeutic use of anti-CD18
antibodies for the treatment of ocular inflammatory
conditions, including uveitis.EP-A-0314863 discloses that ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction
can be blocked by antagonists, e.g. MoAbs. Anti-ICAM-1
MoAbs are used for in vitro treatment of inflammation
resulting from a response of the non-specific defence
system in mammals.Expression of cell adhesion molecules has been
demonstrated in tissues other than ocular tissue, during
inflammation, and blockage of these cell adhesion
molecules has resulted in inhibition of inflammation.
Several cell adhesion molecules have been demonstrated on
ocular tissues in vitro and in vivo, by Elner et al,
(1991) Am J Path 138:525-536; Kaminska et al. (1991)
Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 32(Supp) 677; and Forrester et
al, (1990) Curr Eye Res 9(Supp) 183-191.According to the present invention, an antibody
having binding affinity for a cell adhesion molecule
selected from LFA-1, ICAM-1, ELAM-1 and MAC-1, is used for
the manufacture of a medicament for
