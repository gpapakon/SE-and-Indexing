<ABSTRACT>
A computerized system for customizing purchase incentives and discount coupons on a plurality of retail stores (10) based on whether a customer buys a promoted item or a competitive item and on the price of the promoted item relative to the competitive item. Each store has plurality of terminals (12.1-12.N) has optical scanners (14.1-14.N) and printers (16.1-16.N) and is connected to a store controller (10) which has access to various databases, including an item record file (20) and an incentive control computer (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING PURCHASE INCENTIVES BASED ON PRICE DIFFERENTIALSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to point-of-sale computer systems of the type used in retail stores to record sales transactions. More particularly, the invention relates to point-of-sale systems capable of generating discount coupons and similar purchase incentives. Discount coupons have long been used in the packaged goods industry to promote the sale of specific items to consumers. Many discount coupons are distributed by mail, or as inserts (known as free standing inserts) in newspapers and magazines. This method of distribution has the major drawback that it is not "targeted" to consumers most likely to use the discount coupons. Consequently, mass distribution of discount coupons results in a very low rate of redemption of the coupons. Most consumers simply ignore them or, if they use coupons at all, discard them because of lack of interest in the specifically promoted products.A revolutionary change in techniques of discount coupon distribution began with the system described in U.S. Patent No. 4,723,212 issued to Thomas L. Mindrum et al., entitled "Method and Apparatus for Dispensing Discount Coupons. " In this system, coupons were generated and distributed in the retail store, based on the products purchased by the consumers. If a consumer purchased a "triggering" product that had been previously selected as part of a promotion, the consumer would receive a discount coupon upon paying for purchased items at a checkout stand. The coupon handed to the consumer typically provides for a discount on a competitive or comple- mentary product when the customer returned to the store on a subsequent visit. Thus, in the system described in the Mindrum et al. patent, discount coupons generated in the store were distributed only to consumers who had been "targeted" because of their purchase of competitive or related products. U.S. Patent No. 4,910,672 issued to George W. Off et al., having the same title, disclosed additional features of the system described in the Mindrum et al. patent. 

 Although the system described in the Mindrum et al. and Off et al. patents constituted a significant improvement in techniques for the generation and distribution of discount coupons, there were nevertheless a number of aspects of coupon distribution that these two prior patents did not address. Basically, the prior system uses only one condition for generation of a coupon: whether the consumer had presented a

CLAIMS
We claim:
1. Targeted incentive generation apparatus, for use with a sales transaction recording system having at least one checkout terminal and a store controller with access to an item price file, the apparatus comprising: storage means for holding data defining separate sets of incentive terms pertaining to at least one item of which sales are to be promoted; means for identifying a purchased triggering item presented at a checkout terminal; means for identifying an additional item associated with the purchased triggering item in an incentive deal, wherein one of the two items is a promoted item and the other is a competitive item; means for obtaining sales prices for the promoted item and the competitive item; means for selecting a set of incentive terms from the storage means, based on whether the purchased triggering item is the promoted item or the competitive item, and further based on the prices of the promoted item and the competitive item, wherein the incentive terms are tailored to a consumer's purchasing behavior and the price of the promoted item relative to the competitive item; and means for generating an incentive for the consumer, consistent with the selected set of incentive terms.
2. Targeted incentive generation apparatus as defined in claim 1 , wherein: each set of incentive terms takes the form of an entry in a table of incentive terms accessed by a first parameter defining whether the purchased item is the promoted item or the competitive item, and a second parameter defining the relative price relationship between the promoted item and the competitive item. 

3. Targeted incentive generation apparatus as defined in claim 2, wherein: the second parameter provides for access to different table entries based on whether the competitive item price is more, less, or the same as the promoted item price.
4. Targeted incentive generation apparatus as defined in claim 3, wherein: the second parameter defining the price relationship has at least three values, including a first value when the purchased item has the lower price, a second value when the purchased item and the competitive items have the same price, and a third value when the purchased item has the higher price.
5. Targeted incentive generation apparatus as defined in claim 1 , wherein: the apparatus further comprises means for identifying at least one other additional item associated with the purchased triggering item; one of the triggering and additional items is a promoted item and the others are competitive items; the means for obtaining sales prices obtains the prices of all the additional items; and the storage means contains additional sets of incentive terms, for use in selecting a set of incentive terms for each possible pairing of promoted and competitive items.
6. A method for generation of purchase incentives, for use with a sales transaction recording system having at least one checkout terminal and a store controller with access to an item price file, the method comprising the steps of: storing in a storage means data defining multiple separate sets of incentive terms pertaining toe at least one item of which sales are to be promoted; identifying a purchased triggering item presented at a checkout terminal; identifying an additional item associated with the purchased triggering item in an incentive deal, wherein one of the two items is a promoted item and the other is 


a competitive item; obtaining sales prices for the promoted item and the competitive item; selecting a set of incentive terms from the storage means, based on whether the purchased triggering item is the promoted item or the competitive item, and farther based on the prices of the promoted item and the competitive item, wherein the incentive is tailored to a consumer's purchasing behavior and to the price of the promoted item relative to the competitive item; and generating an incentive for the consumer, consistent with the selected set of incentive terms.
7. A method as defined in claim 6, wherein the step of selecting a set of incentive terms includes: retrieving a set of incentive terms from an incentive matrix accessed by first and second parameters, wherein the first parameter is whether or not the purchased item is the promoted item and the second parameter is the price of the promoted item relative to the price of the competitive item.
8. A method as defined in claim 7, wherein: the second parameter defining the price relationship has at least three values, including a first value when the purchased item has the lower price, a second value when the purchased item and the competitive items have the same price, and a third value when the purchased item has the higher price.
9. A method as defined in claim 6, wherein: the method further comprises the step of identifying at least one other additional item associated with the purchased triggering item, one of the purchased and additional items being a promoted item and the others being competitive items; the step of obtaining sales prices includes obtaining sales prices of all of the additional items; and the step of selecting a set of incentive terms includes selecting multiple 


sets of incentive terms, each applicable to a different possible pairing of promoted and competitive items.
