<ABSTRACT>
A cushioning element for use in a shoe is disclosed. The cushioning element includes 
four fluid-filled support chambers which are compressible but not collapsible, and which are 

disposed at different locations throughout the midsole of the shoe. The element also includes 
four variable volume fluid reservoir chambers which are collapsible to reduce the volume 

thereof. The reservoir chambers are controllably linked in fluid communication with the support 
chambers so as to be selectively in full communication with or isolated from the support 

chambers. By selectively isolating one or more of the reservoir chambers from one or more of 
the support chambers, and collapsing the isolated chamber, fluid may be moved from one 

support chamber to another at a different location, thereby increasing the stiffness of the midsole 
at a selected location.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is directed to a cushioning system for a shoe, and in particular, a fluid-filled
bladder cushioning system containing separate reservoir chambers.Bladders have long been used in shoes as a cushion to increase shoe comfort, enhance
foot support, reduce the risk of injury and other deleterious effects, and decrease fatigue. In
general, the bladders are comprised of elastomeric materials which are shad to define at least
one pressurized pocket or chamber. Typically, a bladder will actually define many chambers
arranged in a pattern designed to achieve one or more of the above-stated objectives. The
chambers may be pressurized with a number of different mediums, such as air, various gases,
water, or other liquids.Many different chamber configurations have been developed in an effort to achieve the
desired result. For instance, bladders have been constructed with a single chamber that extends
over the entire area of the sole. One example of this type of bladder is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 2,080,469 to Gilbert, entitled "Pneumatic Foot Support. " Alternatively, bladders have
included a number of chambers fluidly interconnected with one another. Examples of these
types of bladders are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,183,156 to Rudy, entitled "Insole 
Construction For Articles of Footwear," hereby, incorporated by reference, and U.S. Patent No.
900,867 to Miller, entitled "Cushion for Footwear." However, these type of bladder
constructions have been known to flatten and "bottom out" when they receive high impact
pressures, such as experienced in athletic activities. Such failures negate the intended benefits
of providing the bladder.In an effort to overcome this problem, bladders have been developed wherein the
chambers are fluidly connected by restricted openings. Examples of these bladders are
illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,217,705 to Donzis, entitled "Self-contained Fluid Pressure Foot
Support Device," U.S. Patent No. 4,129,951 to Petrosky, entitled "Air Cushion Shoe Base," and
U.S. Patent No. 1,304,915 to Spinney, entitled "Pneumatic Insole." These bladders, however,
have tended to either be ineffective in overcoming the deficiencies of the non-restricted bladders
or have been too expensive to manufacture.Additionally, artisans have developed shoe bladders which include a number of separate
chambers that are independent of one another. In other words, the chambers are not fluidly
connected. Hence, the fluid contained in any one chamber is precluded from passing into
another chamber.
