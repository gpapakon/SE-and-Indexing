<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device in air-suspended trucks to adjust the level of the truck loading plane. The device consists of a valve (8) which is fixedly secured to the loading plane and is in communication with a pair of lifting bellows (4, 5) incorporated in the air-suspension mechanism. The valve is mechanically connected to one of the wheel axles (2) of the vehicle by way of an articulated arm (9) which is adapted to sense a change of level between the loading plane and the wheel axle (2). In response to changes of the loading plane level, the articulated arm (9) opens the valve (8), said valve conducting pressurized air to or from the lifting bellows (4, 5) respectively for the purpose of adjusting the level of the loading plane. The device comprises a pivotal arm (10) which is arranged to control the opening/closing mechanism of the valve (8). At one of its ends the pivotal arm (10) is hingedly connected to the articulated arm (9) and at its opposite end it is connected to a control mechanism (11). With the aid of said mechanism (11) the pivotal arm (10) may be shifted between two end positions in which the valve (8) is in a maximum open condition for respectively supply of pressurized air and venting of pressurized air from the lifting bellows (4, 5) via an intermediate position in which the valve (8) is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a device in air-suspended 
trucks to adjust the level of the truck loading 
plane above the vehicle wheel axles. The device consists 
of a valve which is fixedly secured to the loading plane 
and is in communication with a pair of lifting bellows 
incorporated in the air-suspension means, said valves also 
being mechanically connected to one of the wheel axles by 
way of an articulated arm. The articulated arm is adapted 
to sense a change of level of the loading plane in 
relation to the wheel axle and in response to such changes 
to open the valve to bring the latter to supply air to the 
lifting bellows or to vent air therefrom in order to 
adjust the loading plane level. A device of this nature is already known for instance 
from the French Utility Model No. 2,650,552. The device 
described therein provides automatic level adjustment of 
the loading plane above the wheel axles. In case the 
loading plane is heavily loaded with the result that the 
loading plane sinks somewhat towards the wheel axles, a 
relative movement valve/articulated arm will occur and the 
valve will open and in turn supply pressurized air to the 
lifting bellows, in consequence of which the loading plane 
will again rise to the original level, and when this level 
is reached the articulated arm shuts off the valve. This prior-art system usually also comprises an 
operating means which is coupled to the device in order to 
allow manual adjustment of the loading plane level. The 
operating means used by the vehicle driver is an electric 
box with control buttons, and the box is connected to 
magnetic valves. With the aid of the valve the operator 
can control the flow of pressurized medium in order to 
manually adjust the level of the loading plane while at 
the same time the valve providing the automatic function 
is shunted, thus preventing the latter from counter-acting 
the intended movement of the loading plane.  
 This prior-art system suffers from several drawbacks. 
The system has a comparatively complicated structure, in 
addition to which it is sensitive to failure, electrical 
ones such as contact failures, and mechanical ones, such a 
valve failures. Furthermore, magnetic valves require 
extensive additional wiring. In case of malfunctioning 
while on the road the driver has but limited chances to 
repair the fault on account of the complexity of the 
system. Also, the large number of components required for 
the manual operation of the loading plane level makes the 
system expensive.

<CLAIMS>
A device in air-suspended trucks to adjust the level 
of the truck loading plane above the vehicle wheel axles, 

said device consisting of a valve (8) which is fixedly 
secured to the loading plane and is in communication with 

a pair of lifting bellows (4, 5) incorporated in the air-suspension 
means, said valve also being mechanically 

connected to one of the wheel axles (2) by way of an 
articulated arm (9), said arm being adapted to sense a 

change of level of the loading plane in relation to the 
wheel axles (2) and, in response to such changes, to open 

the valve (8) to bring the latter to supply air to the 
lifting bellows (4, 5) or to vent air therefrom in order 

to adjust the loading plane level, 
characterized
 
in that the device comprises a pivotal arm 

(10), the centre portion of which is connected to said 
valve (8) such that a change in the angular position of 

said pivotal arm with respect to the loading plane 
controls the opening/closing mechanism of the valve, one 

side of said pivotal arm (10) being pivotally connected to 
said articulated arm (9) while its opposite side is 

connected to the control member (14) of a manually 
operated control mechanism (11), by means of which the 

pivotal arm (10) may be rotated from one end position in 
which the valve (8) is in a maximum open condition for 

supply of air to the lifting bellows (4, 5), via a 
intermediate position in which the valve (8) is closed, to 

an opposite end position, in which the valve (8) is in a 
maximum open condition for venting of air from the lifting 

bellows (4, 5) and vice versa.
