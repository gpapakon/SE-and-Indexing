<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a nonporous composite material formed by 
combination of a liquid crystal polymer with a porous support membrane to 

provide a thin, multiaxially oriented liquid crystal polymer film on the porous 
support membrane; or a thin, multiaxially oriented liquid crystal polymer layer 

within the porous support membrane. Lyotropic or thermotropic liquid crystal 
polymers may be used. A process for making the composite material and 

orienting the liquid crystal polymer is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to liquid crystal polymer films and, more
specifically, to thin oriented liquid crystal polymer films and to a method for
producing them.Liquid crystal polymers are a family of materials that exhibit a highly
ordered structure in the melt, solution, and solid states. They can be broadly
classified into two types; lyotropic, having liquid crystal properties in the
solution state, and thermotropic, having liquid crystal properities in the melted
state.Most liquid crystal polymers exhibit excellent physical properties such as
high strength, good heat resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion,
good electrical insulation characteristics, low moisture absorption, and are
good barriers to gas flow. Such properties make them useful in a broad range
of applications in the form of fibers, injection molded articles, and, in sheet
form, as electronic materials for printed circuit boards, packaging, and the like.However, many of the physical properties of liquid crystal polymers are
very sensitive to the direction of orientation of the liquid crystal regions in the
polymer. The ordered structure of the liquid crystal polymer is easily oriented
by shear forces occurring during processing and highly aligned liquid crystal
chains can be developed that are retained in the solid state, and result in
highly anisotropic properties. This can be highly desirable for certain products,
for example, in filaments, fibers, yarns, and the like. Anisotropic properties are
often not desirable, however, in products having planar forms, such as tape,
films, sheet, and the like.A number of methods are used to produce liquid crystal polymer
materials in planar forms that have more balanced, less anisotropic properties.
These include the use of multilayer flat dies which are oriented such that they 
extrude overlapping layers at intersecting angles, use of
static mixer-agitators at the die inlets, and the like.
More recently, dies having rotating or counter-rotating
surfaces have become known in the art and successfully
used. These extrusion techniques, used separately or in
combination with other methods known in the art, such as
film blowing, can produce liquid crystal polymer film and
sheet that are multiaxially oriented, that is, oriented in
more than one direction, and have more balanced physical
properties.A characteristic of these methods is that locally, for
example, at the surfaces of the sheet or film, the
molecules are oriented in the planar x - y directions by
shear imparted at the extrusion
