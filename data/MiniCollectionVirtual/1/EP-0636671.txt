<ABSTRACT>
Described is a polishing material, particularly a polishing 
slurry, for particularly hard materials such as silicon 

carbide. The material comprises diamond particles with a 
median particle size of around one micrometer and alpha 

alumina particles with a median size of from about 20 to 
about 200 nanometers, and the diamond to alumina weight ratio 

in the material is from 1:30 to 1:90.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polishing materials.Certain very hard ceramic materials are extremely difficult
to polish to a fine finish unless a diamond polishing slurry
is employed. Such materials include for example silicon
carbide, aluminum/titanium carbide, tungsten carbide,
aluminum nitride and alpha alumina monolith bodies. Diamond
is very expensive and thus the polishing process itself is
very costly.Typical diamond slurries for this application contain diamond
particles less than 2 µm in diameter and contain from about
10 to about 20 carats per liter of the diamond. The diamond
particles need to be kept in suspension and this is typically
done using suspending agents. USP 5,149,338 however teaches
the use of a colloidal boehmite to maintain a diamond
abrasive powder in suspension. This is said to yield a
finish below 2 nm (20 angstroms) RMS when used on silicon
carbide at a pH of 4. The boehmite has no significant
abrasive qualities and is merely a means of presenting the
diamond particles to the surface in a more efficient way.
Moreover the pH used is severely corrosive of all but the
best quality stainless steel, (or other resistant material),
for the equipment contacted by the slurry. Other materials
are available for polishing such hard ceramics including
colloidal silica but while these are undoubtedly cheaper than
diamond they are generally less effective and take much
longer to achieve an acceptable finish.There is therefore a need for a cheaper alternative to
diamond for polishing hard materials that does not have a
deleterious effect on the equipment used. It is therefore
the object of the present invention to provide a polishing
which avoids the above mentioned drawbacks. This object is
solved by the polishing material according to independent 
claim 1. Further advantageous features, aspects and details
of the invention are evident from the dependent claims, the
description and the examples.The material according to the present invention is more
effective than diamond used alone and yet is quicker to
achieve a desired surface finish. While not so cheap as
colloidal silica it is substantially less expensive than a
pure diamond polishing slurry.The invention particularly relates to polishing materials
based on diamond that are used to produce fine finishes on
hard materials.The present invention provides an aqueous polishing slurry
comprising diamond particles having a median particle size of
less than 5 µm and alpha alumina particles with an average
particle size of from 20 to 200
