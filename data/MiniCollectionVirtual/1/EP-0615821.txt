<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for slicing foodstuffs, especially bread, having a front chamber 7 which is situated in front of the cutting knife(-ves) 11, into which chamber 7 the foodstuffs can be inserted via an insertion aperture 3 and out of which chamber 7 the foodstuffs can be moved towards the knife(-ves) 11, especially by means of a slide 14, and having a rear chamber 12 in which the sliced foodstuffs remain until they are removed through a front removal aperture 4, the rear chamber being arranged on the front of the apparatus and the front chamber 7 being situated behind the rear chamber 12 looking from the front of the apparatus, the insertion aperture 3 being situated on the front and/or top of the apparatus above the removal aperture 4 and/or the rear chamber 12.

An apparatus for the cutting of individual loaves into 
slices, the device having an upstream space (7) which is disposed 

upstream of the cutting blade or blades (11) and into which the 
loaves can be introduced individually via a feed opening (3) and 

out of which the loaf can be moved more particularly by a pusher 
(14) against the blade or blades (11), the apparatus also having 

a downstream space (12) in which the cut loaf lies until it is 
removed via a front removal opening (4), the downstream space 

being disposed on the front side of the apparatus and the 
upstream space (7) being disposed behind the downstream space 

(12), viewed from the front side of the apparatus, and wherein 
the feed opening (3) leading to the cutting grid (11) is disposed 

on the front side of the apparatus above the removal opening (4) 
and/or the downstream space (12), characterized in that the loaf 

is guided via a deflecting plate (8) from the feed opening (3) to 
the upstream space (7), the deflecting plate (8) sloping in the 

rear zone downwardly towards the upstream space (7) and forming 
in the front zone adjacent the feed opening (3) a bottom (9) on 

which the loaf can be laid, and wherein the bottom (9) adjacent 
the feed opening (3) on the front side merges into a front 

downwardly bent wall (5) whose lower end forms the upper boundary 
of the removal opening (4). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that an 
introduction shaft (6) for the loaves is determined by the 

deflecting plate (9) sloping in the rear zone downwardly towards 
the upstream space (7).  

 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bottom (10) of the upstream space (7) 

slopes downwardly towards the downstream space (12). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bottom (10) of the upstream space (7) 

can be pulled out rearwardly. 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bottom (14) of the downstream space 

(12) slopes downwards forwardly. 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bottom (14) of the downstream space 

(12) can be pulled out forwardly. 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the upstream space (7) is covered by an 

upper protective wall (15) which extends from the top side to the 
rear side of the apparatus and is attached releasably or 

hingeably. 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the feed opening (3) and the removal 

opening (4) disposed therebelow are disposed in the front (2) of 
the apparatus. 
An apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
front (2) containing the feed opening (3) and the removal  

 
opening (4) is disposed at an angle such that the lower zone of 

the front is disposed further forwardly and the upper zone of the 
front is disposed further rearwardly. 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bottom (9) is disposed horizontally. 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the blades (11) form a cutting grid which 

separates the upstream space (7) from the downstream space (12). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a photoelectric cell (17) is disposed in 

the zone of the feed opening (3). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 
12, characterized in that a photoelectric cell (17) is disposed 

in the zone of the introduction shaft (6). 
An apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a photoelectric cell (13) is disposed in 

the zone of the upstream space (7).
