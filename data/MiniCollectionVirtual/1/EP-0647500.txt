<ABSTRACT>
An aligning and supplying apparatus (1) comprises a 
container (2) to store screws, a chute which gets in the 

container (2) and is formed on the top surface thereof with 
a groove (3) having a smaller width than the diameter of the 

screw head so as to receive the screw shank, means for 
relatively moving the container and the chute between a 

first position where the bottom surface of the container and 
the top surface of the chute meet and second position where 

the top surface of the chute rises to a predetermined height 
from the bottom surface of the container, and a first air 

nozzle (14) which is positioned so as to face towards the 
top surface of the chute and blows off a screw (23) fallen 

without getting into the groove of the chute. The screw 
shank is received into the chute groove when the apparatus 

is in the first position and the screw (23) which lies 
fallen on the top surface of the chute is blown off, leaving 

screws aligned in a row in the groove (3). Thus, the screws 
stand in a row in the chute.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is known a headed rod member aligning and
supplying apparatus which is constructed to align headed rod
members, such as screws, in a manner that their heads are
positioned in the same orientation for supplying the aligned
headed rod members one by one. This apparatus is used for
automatically feeding screws or the like to an air driver or
some other power tool. In the headed rod member aligning
and supplying apparatus as presently used, a large number of
headed rod members such as screws scattered in pieces are
put in a bowl-like container. The container is constructed
to be vibrated in a predetermined amount to let the headed
rod members ascend in a helical track formed therein. An
attachment member mounted on the middle of the track aligns
headed rod members in the track by steadying the unstably
positioned headed rod members passing through it and
removing ones which are positioned more unstably.As the above-described aligning and supply apparatus of
headed ROD members aligns scattered headed rod members,
automatic supply of screws or the like to an air driver or
some other power tools is possible. Nevertheless, in this
apparatus, the form of the attachment member and its
position and posture in attaching it to the container
heavily depend on experience and skill and a skilled
technician is needed to align a large quantity of headed rod
members stably.GB-A-2 179 643 describes a headed rod member aligning and
supplying apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. In
this apparatus, a brush member is oscillatingly arranged so as
to remove screws in an abnormal position on the upper surface of
said chute.Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide a
headed rod member aligning and supplying apparatus for
aligning a large quantity of headed rod members stably
without relying on a skilled technician. According to the present invention, there is provided a
headed rod member aligning and supplying apparatus adapted
to align headed rod members, such as screws, in a manner
such that their heads are positioned in a line and with the
same orientation for supplying the headed rod members one by
one from the line,
comprising a
container to receive a large number of headed rod members;
an elongated chute having a portion inserted into the
container and a top surface which is formed with a groove of
a width being larger than a shank diameter of one of the
headed rod members, but smaller than a head diameter and of
a sufficient depth to receive a shank therein; moving means
for effecting relative

<CLAIMS>
A headed rod member aligning and supply apparatus
adapted to align headed rod members such as screws in a

manner such that their heads are positioned in a line with
the same orientation for supplying the headed rod members

one by one from the line,
comprising a

container (2) to receive a large number of headed rod
members (23), an elongated chute (4) having a portion

inserted into the container and a top surface which is
formed with a groove (3) of a width being larger than a

shank diameter of a headed rod member (23) but smaller than
a head diameter and of a sufficient depth to receive a shank

therein, moving means for effecting relative movement
between the container (2) and the chute (4) to move both the

container and the chute between a first position in which
the bottom surface of the container and the top surface of

the chute meet and a second position in which the top
surface of the chute rises to a predetermined height from

the bottom surface of the container,
whereby in the first

position the shanks of a plurality of headed rod members are
received in the chute groove from the container in which a

large number of headed rod members are contained and whereby
the shanks of the plurality of headed rod members are

contained in the chute groove, and the container or the chute is
moved by the moving means to take the second position in

which the top surface of the chute is raised from the bottom
surface of the container,

characterised in that the apparatus further comprises
an air nozzle (14)

positioned to be directed toward the top surface of the
chute to blow off headed rod members lying fallen without

getting into the groove of the chute, whereby in the second position, the
air nozzle 

(14)
blows off the headed rod members lying fallen on

the top surface of the chute to retain only the aligned
headed rod members in a row being left in the groove.
The aligning and supplying apparatus according to Claim
1, characterised in that the chute is connected to a

feed member (18) which extends to escapement means (19)
which separates and feeds the aligned headed rod

members one by one, and a second air nozzle (15) is
provided for blowing off air onto the top surface of

the chute so as to send the headed rod members aligned
in a row in the groove to the feed member.
