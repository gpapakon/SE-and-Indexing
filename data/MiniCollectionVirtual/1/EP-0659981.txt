<ABSTRACT>
Such comprises providing every oven (1) used in the 
plant, over the exhaust passage (2) as such, with an 

operative unit (3) that works with an input exchanger (4) 
and a filter (5) that allows most of the waste products 

carried by the fumes to be recovered and sent back to the 
oven (1) and hence recycled. The operative units (3) of 

the various ovens (1) are associated in parallel to a 
joint water circuit (8) wherein a single output exchanger 

(9) is provided, that is in turn associated to a 
turbogenerator (10), in which the secondary circuit (11) 

of the exchanger (9) uses a high molecular mass organic 
fluid to drive a turbine (12) that in turn drives the 

alternator (13) that generates electric power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new heat recovery
and gases filtering system at the output of industrial
fusion ovens with which a high yield is achieved in the
production of electric power, and the fumes are perfectly
scrubbed and the waste products obtained are recyclable.The process subject hereof stems from a special
application in the glass-ceramics and chemical industry
but is equally applicable in a different field where a
similarly high level of performance is required.Combustion fumes in industrial fusion ovens are
currently either let off directly into the atmosphere,
with the problems this entails from the standpoint of
both environmental pollution and waste of energy, or go
through a filtering stage to be scrubbed, in which event
they must first pass through a heat exchanger in which
the heat energy of the fumes is extracted in order to
cool the same down and enable their mechanical filtering
using conventional cap filters.The heat absorbed by the exchanger can be used
directly or indirectly, whereas the waste products
extracted from fumes can be disposed of or recycled.In certain industrial fields, however, for instance 
when obtaining an enamelling frit, within the aforesaid'
ceramic field, various ovens need to be used, each of
which produces a particular kind of enamel. This means
that with current filtering systems for combustion gases,
the waste products are mixed and, being different per se,
since originating in ovens using likewise different raw
materials, there is no way that they can be reused,
wherefore the said waste products must be thrown out.Bearing in mind that a normal ceramic enamelling
plant uses twelve ovens and each oven generates some 70
kg/day of waste products carried by the exhaust gases,
clearly the amount of raw material wasted is significant
and it is extremely important for the same to be
recyclable.The heat recovery and combustion gases filtering
system subject of the invention has been devised in order
to fully solve the foregoing problems, on the one hand
making the most of the energy and on the other enabling
full recycling of the waste products obtained from
filtering.More specifically and in order to achieve the above,
the system subject hereof is based upon the provision of
an operative filtering unit for each oven used in the
plant, obviously working with the respective heat
exchanger allowing such filtering to be carried out under
the best possible conditions, such operative unit being
located over the oven exhaust passage as such to obtain
hot water
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fusion heat recovery and combustion gases
filtering system with electric power production,

especially applicable to ceramic enamelling plants and the
like where several ovens (1) are used with various kinds

of enamel,

said system comprising:

a plurality of operative filtering units (3), one for
each oven (1), each of said filtering unit comprising an

input heat exchanger (4) for cooling the fumes coming from
said oven (1) to an ideal temperature for filtering the

same,

a textile bag or cap filter (5) for recovering particles
contained in said cooled fumes, and means for sending the

particles recovered in said filter (5) back to the oven
(1);
a water circuit connecting the input heat exchangers (4)
to an output heat exchanger (9), wherein said input heat

exchangers (4) are connected in parallel to said water
circuit (8); and

an organic cycle turbogenerator (10) to which the heat
absorbed by the input heat exchangers (4) is transmitted

by said output heat exchanger (9).
A fusion heat recovery and combustion gases
filtering system with electric power production, as in

claim 1, wherein the operative units (3) are arrangeable
in the exhaust passages (2) of said ovens (1), and are

connected by means of passages of small diameter to the
water circuit (8) and through the latter to the output

exchanger (9).
A fusion heat recovery and combustion gases
filtering system with electric power production, as in the

above claims, wherein the turbogenerator (10) is provided
with a secondary circuit (11) for the output heat 

exchanger (9) through which a high molecular mass organic

fluid flows, which circuit (11) is provided with a turbine
(12) driving an alternator (13) that generates electric

power into which the heat energy extracted by the input
heat exchangers (4) from the fumes as they leave the ovens

(1) is transformed.
