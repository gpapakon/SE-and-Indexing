<ABSTRACT>
A careful choice of materials and of their coupling allows to obtain 
an electrochemical sensor capable of precisely and reliably 

determining the sulfur content of molten iron-based metal baths. 
Said sensor can also work continuously for periods of time comparable 

to the processing ones for pig-iron or steel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrochemical sensor for 
sulfur determination in molten iron-based baths and, more 
particularly, to a Ca-concentration cell capable to work for tens of 
minutes at temperatures ranging from 1250 to 1700 °C, for sulfur 
determination in molten pig-iron or steel baths. In the production of pig-iron and steel, owing to the high 
investment costs and to the low market value of the products, a 
continuous effort is being made to improve the quality of the end-products 
and to enhance the productivity of the plants. Thus, great 
care is used for expanding the utilization of continuous production 
processes and their automation as well as for accurately controlling 
said processes and the quality of relevant products. Clearly, the chemical composition of the products is a quality 
essential factor. A number of quality control techniques have been 
developped, all based on the laboratory analysis of samples coming 
from the steel plant or from the blast-furnace cast house. Only in 
some cases said analysis techniques did evolve in such a way to be 
carried out in real time, and even not in the laboratory but at the 
very metal working place. However, we are still far from being able to control in real time  
 
the majority of the chemical elements; in particular, for the 
sulfur, which is a very important element for the brittleness of 
steel and pig-iron, its analysis still requires, from the sampling 
until the analysis result is obtained, an execution time 
confrontable with the processing time of the metal. This obviously permits the quality check of the obtained product, 
but in the majority of cases prevents an intervention during the 
production process to optimize the product composition. Though for the sulfur analysis several methods and devices capable 
to work up to 700-800 °C have been introduced in the chemical and in 
the petrochemical fields, as well as in the field of non-ferrous metals, 
in the field of pig-iron and steel production the very high 
temperatures reached by the baths, from 1250-1300 °C up to 1600-1700 
°C, did prevent up to now the development of suitable sensors, which 
are also able to work continuously immersed in the molten bath for 
several minutes. The object of present invention is to provide an electrochemical 
sensor for quickly determining the sulfur content of iron-based 
molten metal baths. Another object of the present invention is to provide a calcium 
concentration cell, for the quick continuous determination of the 
sulfur
