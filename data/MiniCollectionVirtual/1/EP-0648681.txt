<ABSTRACT>
The inventions relate to the mounting and fixing of a measuring and removal spoon 10,11,12,13,14, at the upper end of a metal container to prevent the removal spoon from being submersed in the dry contents of the container 1 during transportation. The container is provided, at its upper end, with a hermetic closure 20,21 which is to be opened once and a reclosable plastic lid 30,31. The measuring spoon 10 can be stuck to the hermetic closure 20 by means of an adhesive point 4. The measuring spoon can also be fixed at the upper end by means of retentions 22a,22b,22c,22d which are fixed to the container, for the purpose of which it is designed at both ends to be either wedge-shaped or notch-shaped, the lid-side fastening having the respective counter-contour. The measuring spoon can also be held by a lowered annular section 22e of a lid ring 22, resting on the latter, a hermetically sealing film being sealed onto the further annular horizontal section, spaced axially away from the annular support 22e. Finally, it is proposed to use the top peripheral bead 1a in the container body 1 as a support for a measuring spoon 14 which corresponds in its dimensions approximately to the diameter and to achieve the other axial bearing of the measuring spoon by means of a lid ring 22 or by means of a film which is sealed onto a container border 3a.
