<ABSTRACT>
Provided in a shower cubicle having a shower tray (2) is a pump (14) for pumping away any water collecting in the shower tray (2). Such a shower cubicle is intended to be further developed to the effect that, with a low degree of outlay and high functional reliability, the pumping-away of the water is ensured. It is proposed that there be arranged, on the underside of the shower tray (2), a contactless sensor (20) by means of which the pump (14) can be activated.
