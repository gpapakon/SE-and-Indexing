<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile cellular communication system, a base station 
is wired to a Local Area Network (LAN), and has wireless 

communication with a plurality of mobile stations. 
Multipath fading is substantially reduced in the system 

by utilizing antenna diversity techniques at the base 
station and each of the plurality of mobile stations. 

The combination of the independent operation of antenna 
selection diversity at both a base station and a mobile 

station results in the selection of the best propagation 
path between the two stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data communications
via radio, and in particular to the problem of multipath
fading. Specifically, a combination of antenna diversity
techniques is utilized at both a base station and a
mobile station in a dynamic way to mitigate the effects
of multipath fading in the data transmission process.In a mobile/indoor cellular radio communication system,
a base station usually communicates with multiple mobile
stations and functions as a bridge between mobiles and
landline networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs). One
of the major impairments in this radio communication
environment is the multipath fading phenomenon. Antenna
diversity techniques have been used to mitigate this
multipath fading phenomenon. However, either transmitting
or receiving antenna diversity techniques have been
utilized in the past. These techniques have been
utilized in a number of patents, each having certain
advantages and disadvantages.U.S. Patent 4,761,822 to Maile discloses a burst-mode
two-way communication system in which a plurality of
transceivers at a base station share a common antenna
arrangement. The common antenna arrangement consists of
a plurality of antenna branches and antenna branch
selection is made by an operative base station
transceiver with regard to the received signal strength
from a portable transceiver. U.S. Patent 4,953,197 to Kalwell, Jr. et al discloses a
spatial diversity system in which a post-detection selection
diversity scheme is used. The selection criteria are link
quality, AGC level, and parity check errors. The main emphasis
is on radio telephone communication applications.U.S. Patent 5,065,499 to Gordon et al discloses a switching
antenna diversity scheme in which each antenna is coupled with
circuitry to measure the instantaneous and average received
signal strength. Antennas are switched if the current signal
strength of selected antenna falls below a threshold
calculated from the average value. Antennas are also switched
if no switching occurs during a predetermined elapsed time.
After the switch, a measured signal strength value is compared
with the previous value and the system switches back to the
previous antenna if the previous signal strength is higher.U.S. Patent 5,123,029 to Bantz et al which is assigned to the
assignee of this invention, discloses a hybrid controlled
access and random access schemes using frequency hopping
spread spectrum communications technqiues, and which is
implemented in an indoor digital data radio communication
system
