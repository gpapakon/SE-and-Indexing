<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve arrangement having a flow-control valve which exhibits a valve piston which is guided displaceably in an axial inner space counter to the force of a spring, and having a main-flow throttle which influences a volume flow to a hydraulic consumer, in the case of which valve arrangement the avoidance of leakages and the adjustment of any control characteristics is possible. For this purpose, it is provided that the valve piston (16) exhibits an end region (24) which, on the one hand, engages over a duct (40) extending from the end space (14) and leading to an intake region of a hydraulic delivery device and, on the other hand, forms a seat valve (47) for sealing the duct (40).
