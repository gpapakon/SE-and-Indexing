Side channel compressor with an annular running wheel
housing (1) with air intake and air outlet connection

pieces (3, 4),

with sound absorber (I), filter (II) or safety valve
(III, IV) attachments which can respectively be joined to

the connection pieces or pipe bends (30, 31; 35, 36; 37,
38) connected to them ;
where pipe bends are present, the outlet axes thereof
being directed parallel to the annular plane of the

side channel compressor in the assembled state;
the attachments, as elements (I, II, III, IV)
interchangeable in their sequence, forming a module and

having respectively tubular basic housings (11, 12)
constructed to connect successively and in alignment,
and the module having basic housings with a uniform
system length (L) or mixed with basic housings of

double the system length,
and the attachments being constructed in such a way
that in their axial direction they can be connected by

clamping according to choice directly to one another
and to a connection piece (3, 4) of the side channel

compressor adapted to the basic housing (11, 12) of the
attachments or to a pipe bend (30, 31; 37, 38) inserted

between the connection piece (3, 4) and an attachment
(I, II, III, IV) and adapted to the basic housing.
Side channel compressor according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the connection pieces and the
attachments joined to them extend vertically to the

annular plane of the side channel compressor. 
Side channel compressor according to Claim 1,

characterized in that where pipe bends (30, 31; 35, 36;
37, 38) are inserted the joined attachments extend along

next to one of the end faces of the side channel
compressor.
Side channel compressor according to Claims 2 or 3,

characterized in that the attachment elements (I, II,
III, IV), strung together, can respectively be clamped

together with an upper locking cap (6) by means of
clamping screws (7), penetrating them and engaging in

thread bores (9) of the intake or outlet connection piece
(3, 4) or the pipe bends (30, 31; 35 to 38) and the

clamping screws (7) have a length for clamping together
either two or more attachment elements.
Side channel compressor according to Claim 4,

characterized in that the attachment elements (II, III,
IV) for filter and safety valves have respectively a

housing connection piece (13), protruding laterally from
the basic housing (12), to accommodate the filter

elements (19) and valve device (22, 26).
Side channel compressor according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the housings of the attachment
elements (II, III, IV) for filter and safety valves are

constructed identically and a closed end cap (14) is
allocated respectively to the filter attachment element

(II) and a screw-on end cap (24), provided with an
orifice (25), is respectively allocated to the safety

valve attachment elements (III, IV).
Side channel compressor according to Claim 6,

characterized in that the basic housings (12) have a 
dividing wall (15) which is step-shaped in axial section,

a through orifice (17), coaxial to the housing connection
piece (13), is provided in the stepped wall parallel to

the axis of the basic housing and a holder (18), open
towards the housing connection piece (13), for a

cylindrical filter element (19) which can be inserted
into the housing connection piece (13) is mounted on the

stepped wall (16), the filter element (19) being located
with approximately a third or more of its length in the

basic housing (12).
Side channel compressor according to Claims 5 and 6,

characterized in that the valve devices (22, 26) are
carried in each case by a plate (23, 27), which can be

clamped in between the front end of the housing
connection piece (13) and the associated end cap (24).
Side channel compressor according to Claims 2 or 3,

characterized in that the module comprises attachment
elements of double the system length (L), in which a

common tubular basic housing is provided in each case for
two elements with different functions.
