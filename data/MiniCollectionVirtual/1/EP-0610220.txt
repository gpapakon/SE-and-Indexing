<ABSTRACT>
A "Brayton" type engine has its operating efficiency improved, by obviating cooling apparatus, lining the expansion chamber and piston head with insulating material (56-47) and positioning the piston/cylinder gas seal (46) at that end remote from the gas inlet. The piston is maintained concentric with the cylinder, by, in one mode, supporting it from fixed structure (38) externally of the cylinder. Any lubrication is applied to parts which are in areas which are cool relative to known devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN ENGINES INCLUDING GAS EXPANSION ACTUATED PISTON AND CYLINDER DEVICES The present invention relates to an engine including a device comprising a piston within a cylinder, which piston is caused to move axially within the cylinder by the expansion of hot pressurised gases against an end face thereof. The resulting movement enables work to be done by the piston.The present invention has particular efficacy in that system known as the "Brayton Cycle" engine, wherein air is compressed in one piston and cylinder combination, passed to an external combustor source where it is mixed with fuel and burned and the resulting hot gases passed to a further piston and cylinder combination and expanded against the further piston to achieve the desired result.A drawback common to such engine cycles as those described hereinbefore lies in their need for cooling and lubrication. Such needs generate complex structures including cooling medium channels and supplies and lubrication conduits and supplies in the region of maximum heat, and means for pumping those fluids in a recirculatory manner.A more serious drawback is generated however, by the satisfying of the needs as described above, in that cooling of the cylinder walls removes heat from the gases from within the cylinder, which heat should have been usefully employed by providing the gases with more energy.The present invention seeks to provide an improved engine which includes a gas expansion actuated piston and cylinder device.According to the present invention an engine including a gas expansion actuated piston and cylinder device comprises a cylinder having hot pressurised gas inlet means at one end, exhaust porting spaced from said one end, a piston which for operation rests coaxially within said cylinder in radially spaced relationship therewith, an annular seal fixed to the cylinder downstream of the exhaust 

 porting and engaging the piston in gas sealing, sliding relationship, and means engaging the piston skirt for maintaining the piston and cylinder in said coaxial, radially spaced relationship. The invention will now be described, by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Figure 1 is a diagrammatic example of a "Brayton Cycle" engine incorporating an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 2 is a view in the direction of arrow 2 in Figure 1.Figure 3 is an enlarged, cross-sectional part view of the engine of Figure 1.Figure 4 is a cross-sectional part view of an alternative embodiment of the present

Claims:-
1. An engine including gas expansion means comprising a cylinder having hot gas inlet means at one end, exhaust porting spaced from said one end, a piston (28) which for operation rests coaxially within .said cylinder in radially spaced relationship therewith, characterised by an annular seal (46) fixed to the cylinder (26) downstream of the exhaust porting (36) and engaging the piston (28) in gas sealing, sliding relationship, and means engaging the piston skirt for maintaining the piston (28) and cylinder (26) in said coaxial, radially spaced relationship.
2. An engine as claimed in claim 1 wherein the means for maintaining the piston and cylinder in their coaxial relationship is characterised by earthed guide means (38) positioned externally of the cylinder (26) and to which the cylinder (26) is fixed, said guide means (38) being in parallel with the cylinder axis, and piston connection means (42) fixed to the skirt of the piston (28) which projects from the cylinder (26), said piston connection means (42) being engaged with said guide means (38). 3. An engine as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that the guide means (38) comprises a plurality of rods supported in egui-angularly spaced relationship about the exterior of the cylinder (26) by spiders (42).
4. An engine as claimed in claim 3 wherein said piston connection means comprises one of said spiders (42).
5. An engine as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the means for maintaining the piston (28) and cylinder (26) in their coaxial relationship comprises portions of the cylinder and skirt which are extended beyond said annular seal ( 6), and a piston ring seal (62) is provided and retained in the wall of the bore of the cylinder (26) adjacent its end extremity and in sliding engagement with the extended skirt portion of the piston (28). 6.* An engine as claimed in any previous claim characterised in that the cylinder (26) has a plurality of 


axially spaced annular grooves (44) in its external surface, so as to form thin wall portions which reduce heat transfer in a direction towards the annular seal (46) .
7. An engine as claimed in claim 6 characterised in that the pressure surface (56) of the piston (28) comprises a refractory layer.
8. An engine as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that the piston (28) has the stem of an inlet valve (50) coaxially passing through it and said inlet valve stem (50) comprises metal portions spaced by a heat insulating spacer (60) .
9. An engine as claimed in any previous claim and characterised by a heat insulating cover (47) surrounding the cylinder (26).
