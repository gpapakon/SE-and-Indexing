<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an underground, U-shaped cable duct element which can be walked upon, specially one made of plastic and installed on railway platforms, having support members (6) on the upper ends of the side walls formed in the limbs of the U-shape and protruding horizontally outwards, in addition to reinforcement means which are connected to said support members (6), extending vertically and externally reinforcing the side walls. The aim of the invention is to provide an extremely rigid cable duct element which is easy to handle and which can be produced using a small amount of material. To achieve this, the reinforcement means consists of interspaced, ribbed tubes (8) which are formed inside the side walls. A collapsible lid (2) is locked in a closed position in such a way that it is protected against unauthorized removal.
