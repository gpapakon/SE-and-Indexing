<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to antisense oligonucleotides. More particularly, the invention
relates to oligonucleotides having modified internucleotide linkages that render the
oligonucleotides more resistant to nucleolytic degradation.Synthetic oligonucleotides have become important tools in basic scientific research.
Recently, synthetic oligonucleotides have been successfully used in the area of regulation
of gene expression, which has laid the foundation for a novel therapeutic approach, known
as antisense oligonucleotide therapy, for the treatment of various virus infections and
disorders of gene expression. Several investigators have demonstrated the ability of
oligonucleotides to inhibit virus propagation and to modulate gene expression invitro.Zamecnik and Stephenson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 285-288 (1978) discloses
specific inhibition of Rous Sarcoma Virus replication in infected chicken fibroblasts by
a 13-mer synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide that is complementary to part of the viral genome.Zamecnik et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 4143-4146 (1986) discloses inhibition
of replication and expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, then called HTLV-III)
in cultured cells by synthetic oligonucleotide phosphodiesters complementary to viral
RNA.Recent studies have shown that oligonucleotides act with greater efficacy in the
antisense approach when the oligonucleotides are modified to contain artificial
internucleotide linkages that render the oligonucleotides resistant to nucleolytic
degradation. These studies have involved the use of a variety of artificial internucleotide 
linkages. The most well studied artificial internucleotide linkages have been
methylphosphonate, phosphorothioate and various phosphoramidate internucleotide
linkages.Sarin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 7448-7451 (1988) teaches that
oligodeoxynucleoside methylphosphonates are more active as inhibitors of HIV-1 than
conventional oligodeoxynucleotides.Agrawal et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 7079-7083 (1988) teaches that
oligonucleotide phosphorothioate and various oligonucleotide phosphoramidates are more
effective at inhibiting HIV-I than conventional oligodeoxynucleotides.Agrawal et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 7790-7794 (1989) discloses the
advantage oligonucleotide phosphorothioates in inhibiting HIV-1 in early and chronically
infected cells.Gao et al., Antimicrob. Agents and Chem. 34: 808 (1990) discloses inhibition of HSV
by oligonucleotide phosphorothioates.Storey et al., Nucleic Acids
