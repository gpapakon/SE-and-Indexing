<ABSTRACT>
A supermarket trolley monitoring system is provided for 
detecting shopping items on a lower shelf of the trolley 

35 as the trolley moves through a check-out station. 
Three transmitter/receivers 30, 31, 32 are provided. 

The first 30 and third 32 at level A respond to light 
reflected by a panel 36 on the side of the trolley. The 

system is turned on when the panel 36 passes the first 
transmitter/receiver 30 and off when the panel 36 passes 

the third transmitter/receiver 32. The second 
transmitter/receiver 31 is mounted above A and if any 

object is detected while the system is ON, by reflection 
of the beam from the object, a warning is provided to 

alert a check-out assistant and/or a shopper that an 
item is present on the lower trolley shelf which may not 

have been entered in a till.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to monitoring devices.The invention relates more particularly although not
exclusively to monitoring devices in which the device has
transmitter/receiver which transmit radiation signals
towards an object to be detected and detect any signals
reflected from the object. The devices may be used for
detecting any objects or only particular objects or
persons passing in front of the device. Devices of the
present invention have particular application for use in
supermarkets at check out or exit points and monitor
trolleys passing nearby the devices. Examples of such
devices are described in European Patent application
0175885, UK Patent specification 2028647 and USA Patent
specifications 3725894 and 4338594.According to the invention there is provided a monitoring
device for monitoring passage of objects comprising three
radiation transmitter/receivers arranged to transmit and
receive respective beams of radiation in the same general
direction but laterally spaced apart so as to detect
objects passing the device in the lateral direction and
which interrupt the radiation in use, in which the device
is arranged in use to be activated for detecting the
objects by interruption of the beam of the first
transmitter/receiver, to detect thereafter any object
which interrupts the beam of the second
transmitter/receiver while the device is activated, and be 
deactivated by interruption of the beam of the third
transmitter/receiver.The transmitter/receivers may transmit and receive light
radiation.The transmitted signals may be pulsed and the receiver
arranged to respond only to like pulsed reflected signals.
The pulses may be of short duration and/or have spiked
waveforms.The receivers may be arranged to respond only to reflected
signals which are phase shifted from the transmitted
signals within a predetermined range.According to another aspect of the invention there is
provided a system for monitoring a part of a supermarket
trolley during its passage through a monitoring station
including a monitoring device with transmitter/receivers
as outlined above, each supermarket trolley having a
radiation reflective patch positioned to interrupt the
beams of the first and third transmitter/receivers when
the trolley moves through the monitoring station in the
lateral direction.A patch may be mounted on each opposite corner of the
trolley so that the monitoring system is activated and deactivated
in the same manner whether the trolley moves 
forwards or backwards through the monitoring station.A voice

<CLAIMS>
A monitoring device for monitoring passage of objects
comprising three radiation transmitter/receivers (30, 31,

32) arranged to transmit and receive respective beams of
radiation in the same general direction but laterally

spaced apart so as to detect objects passing the device in
the lateral direction and which interrupt the radiation in

use, characterised in that the device is arranged in use
to be activated for detecting the objects by interruption

of the beam of the first transmitter/receiver (30), to
detect thereafter any object which interrupts the beam of

the second transmitter/receiver (31) while the device is
activated, and be deactivated by interruption of the beam

of the third transmitter/receiver (32).
A monitoring device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the second transmitter/receiver (31)

comprises two or more separate transmitter/receivers (61,
62) arranged adjacent and laterally side by side, the

monitoring device being arranged to detect any object
which interrupts both or all the respective beams of the

second transmitter/receiver simultaneously.
A monitoring device according to claim 2,
characterised in that the monitoring device is arranged to

detect only objects which simultaneous interrupt the beams
for more than at least a short time period. 
A monitoring device according to any one of claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the transmitter/receivers (30,

31, 32) transmit and receive light radiation.
A monitoring device according to any one of claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the transmitted signals are

pulsed and the receivers are arranged to respond only to
like pulsed signals.
A monitoring device according to claim 5,
characterized in that the pulses are of short duration

and/or have spiked waveforms.
A monitoring device according to claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the receivers are arranged to

respond only to signals which are phase shifted from the
transmitted signals within a predetermined range.
A system for monitoring objects supported on a
supermarket trolley (50) during its passage through a

monitoring station characterized by a monitoring device
according to any one of claims 1 to 7.
A system according to claim 8 characterised in that
the supermarket trolleys (50) each have a radiation

reflective patch (51) positioned to interrupt beams of the
first and third transmitter/receivers (31, 32) when the

trolleys move through the monitoring station in the 
lateral direction.
A system according to claim 9, characterized in that
a patch (51) is mounted on each opposite side or corner of

the trolley so that the monitoring device is activated and
deactivated in the same manner whether the trolley moves

forwards or backwards through the monitoring station.
A system according to any one of claims 8 to 10,
characterised by a voice message store arranged to

broadcast a voice message whenever an object interrupts
the beam of the second transmitter/receiver.
A system according to any one of claims 8 to 11,
characterized in that another voice message is generated

whenever the monitoring device is deactivated.
