A silicone rubber composition mainly 
comprising an organopolysiloxane of the average 

compositional formula: R 1 / nSiO

 wherein R¹ is a 
substituted or unsubstituted monovalent 

hydrocarbon group and n = 1.98 to 2.02 can be 
rendered antibacterial and antifungal by 

blending a zeolite containing 0.1 to 15% by 
weight of a silver ion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antibacterial and/or
antifungal silicone rubber compositions, and to ways of
imparting antibacterial and antifungal properties to
silicone rubber products e.g. to improve the living
environment, prolong lifetime and improve food hygiene.In the recent years, silicone rubber is
used in a wide variety of applications covering
electronic, automotive, building, medical and
food industries because of its excellent
properties including weatherability, electrical
properties, low compression set, heat
resistance, and low-temperature resistance.
Typical uses include packings or gaskets in
refrigerators, electric rice cookers, and
electric pots as exemplary home appliances, 
packings in food-keeping containers, and
medical tubes like catheters. The demand for
silicone rubber is increasing and there is a
need for developing a silicone rubber having
more versatile properties.It was recently proposed to add antifungal
agents to render silicone rubber antifungal.
Most antifungal agents used heretofore are
organic agents such as benzimidazole, and
methylsulfonyl. Since these organic agents are
susceptible to a temperature change, light like
ultraviolet radiation, a humidity change, or
trace components in the environment and can be
deteriorated thereby, their effect does not last
long.Attempts have been made for sustaining the
antifungal effect by coating or capsulating such
organic antifungal agents or by adding active
substances to the silicone polymer. These
attempts, however, suffer from several problems,
for example, (1) an increased cost, (2) failure
to exert effect because organic antifungal
agents can be buried in silicone rubber, (3)
difficulty of storage because products treated
with antifungal agents gradually deteriorate in 
effect even if they are not in use, and (4)
degradation by heat vulcanization, which degrades
organic antifungal agents with drastic reduction
in their effectiveness and discolouration of
silicone rubber moldings.More recently, inorganic antifungal and
antibacterial agents were developed. For
example, Japanese Patent Application Kokai
(JP-A) No. 1226/1993 discloses water-soluble
glass containing a silver ion, zinc ion, copper
ion or a mixture thereof. JP-A 20559/1990
discloses blending of protein silver. JP-A
93360/1992 discloses blending of ZnO, MgO,
propionates or a mixture thereof. These
proposals, however, suffer from several
problems. For example, it is difficult to carry
sufficient ions. Some agents cause silicone
rubber to be discolored. Some agents lose
