<ABSTRACT>
Adjustable sieve means (31) are provided for an agricultural 
harvesting machine (1) comprising louvres (41) positioned behind 

one another and being movable through a range of positions 
between a fully closed and a fully opened position; consecutive 

louvres defining an opening (d) inbetween when in an opened 
position; adjustment means (47) for changing said opening (d); 

and opening indicator means (48), including a movable part (65), 
which is unitarily moved with one of said louvres (41), when said 

opening (d) is adjusted. 
These indicator means (48) permit the verification of the 
sieve opening (d), even when the louvres are not accessible for 

measurement with gauges, and a direct link between the louvres 
(41) and the movable part (65) avoids the inaccuracies which are 

conceivable when the indicator means (48) is sensing the movement 
of further, intermediate components of the adjustment means (47).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to agricultural harvesting
machines such as combine harvesters, and more particularly to the
adjustable grain sieves thereof. The invention is particularly
advantageous when on the one hand access to one of this sieves is
limited in such way that direct verification of the actual sieve
opening is hindered and on the other hand when a precise sieve
setting is required for obtaining an efficient grain cleaning.Combine harvesters have been developed for efficient
harvesting of a wide range of crops. To this end a variety of
machine settings can be changed and adjusted. These include the
setting of the louvres of the upper and lower sieves. The opening
inbetween these louvres has to be adapted to the grain type in
order to obtain an efficient separation of grain on the one hand
and chaff and straw on the other hand. Especially the opening of
the lower sieve has to be adjusted to a precise sieve setting in
order to meet optimum grain cleaning requirements. Sieves
enabling such adjustments have already been described in US-A-2.253.296.Usually the opening of the upper sieve is verified by the
insertion of calibrated means such as gauges inbetween the
louvres at the rear of the sieve. The surface of the upper sieve
mostly is readily accessible for such measurement. The lower
sieve however is not as easily accessible because of its hidden
position under said upper sieve. Access to the louvres of the
lower sieve can further be hindered by extensions connected to
the rear of the upper sieve, such as a rake or a sensor plate for
a grain loss indicator. The use of calibrated means for the
verification of this opening thus is rendered unpractical.Several methods have been thought of to by-pass this
problem. On sieves with an adjustment handle which is locked into
a toothed segment, it is a common practice to count the number of
teeth that lay between a leftmost position, in which the louvres
are closed, and the actual position of the handle. But this is
not an accurate measurement of the sieve opening, because the 
leftmost position is not corresponding to the same tooth on every
sieve and the opening determined by one tooth is not necessarily
corresponding to a step of e.g. exactly one millimetre. Further
inaccuracies occur because of the tolerances on the dimensions of
the intermediate adjustment links and handles, because of the
play of these components relative to each other and because of
the possible deformation thereof during operation.The German Utility Model DE-U-69.05.754 is
