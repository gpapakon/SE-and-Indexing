<ABSTRACT>
[Object] It is to provide a thermal transfer receiving paper 

used in copier, printers and facsimiles by utilizing the thermal 
transfer method of thermal melting ink type, particularly a 

thermal transfer receiving paper useful for the cards or labels 
requiring high speed printing and high speed reading, such as 

passenger tickets, passes, airway tickets, POS labels, prepaid 
cards and the like. 
[Constitution] In the thermal transfer receiving paper, a 

coating composition mainly comprising a synthetic polymer resin 
and a porous pigment is coated on one surface of a base paper to 

provide an image-receiving layer receiving a thermal melting ink. 
The synthetic polymer resin has a glass transition point of -60 
to -5 °C and a surface tension of 38 to 58 mN/m, and the porous 

pigment has an apparent specific gravity of 0.1 to 0.5 g/cm³ in 
accordance with JIS K-6220.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer receiving paper for use in 
copiers, printers and facsimiles by utilizing the thermal transfer method of 
thermal melting ink type. More particularly, it relates to a thermal transfer 
receiving paper useful for cards or labels requiring high speed printing and 
high speed reading, such as passenger tickets, passes, airway tickets, POS 
labels, prepaid cards and the like. Abbreviations used herein have the following meanings. 
POS: Point of sale KP: Kraft pulp SP: Sulphite pulp AP: Alkaline pulp SGP: Stone groundwood pulp RGP: Refiner groundwood pulp CTMP: Chemithermomechanical pulp BCTMP: Bleached chemithermomechanical pulp LBKP: Laubholz bleached kraft pulp NBKP: Nadelholz bleached kraft pulp freeness= CSF: Canadian Standard freeness Recently, accompanied with rapid developments in office automation and 
factory automation, copiers, printers and facsimiles utilizing various recording 
methods such as the electrography method and the thermal transfer method 
have been used and have, for example, been widely used in CAD/CAM. 
Colour materials are used for printing images in such a thermal transfer  
 
method and usually the colour material is melted, vaporized or sublimed and 
transferred onto a recording medium such as image-receiving paper, e.g., 
paper or film and thus an image is recorded on it by adhesion, adsorption or 
dyeing. Among these recording methods, a thermal melting transfer method in which 
an ink film having a thermal melting ink layer constituted by colour materials 
and waxes or resins is melted by the heat of a thermal head and the colour 
material is  
 
transfered on a thermal transfer receiving paper to prepare a 
recorded image is noticed to be utilized in card papers such as 
passenger tickets, passes and airway tickets, labels such as POS 
labels and cards such as prepaid cards requiring reliability and 
security as it has advantages such that it requires only simple 
and compact equipments and is maintenance free. The thermal 
melting transfer method also has a feature that it can use plain 
papers as the recording medium. However, even such thermal transfer method cannot give a 
satisfactory result when a plain paper is used as demands for 
full-color printing, high speed printing, clear image printing 
and higher resolution have been increased together with the 
improvement in the performance of the printing equipment in the 
same manner as in the other printing methods. For example, when 
the bar code on a label printed
