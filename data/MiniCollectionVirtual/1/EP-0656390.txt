<ABSTRACT>
An example of composition of this material includes, expressed in parts per hundred parts of all of the polymers mentioned below:   - 50 to 70 parts of a first ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer containing 40 to 50 % of acetate; - 20 to 40 parts of a second ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer containing 30 to 50 % of acetate, a silane being grafted onto this second copolymer; - 10 to 20 parts of an ethylene-propylene copolymer containing between 60 and 75 % of ethylene; - a flame-retardant agent in a quantity chosen depending on the desired degree of fire resistance.   Application to the internal coating of electrical cables.

<CLAIMS>
Highly flame-proofed, halogen-free material, easy to
tear and having very good flexibility at low temperature, for

cable coating in particular; containing the following
composition expressed in parts per 100 parts of all the

polymers listed below:

- a first ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer containing 40 to 50% acetate
50 to 70 parts
- a second ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer containing 30 to 50% acetate; a silane being grafted onto this second copolymer
20 to 40 parts
- an ethylene-propylene copolymer containing between 60 and 75% ethylene;
10 to 20 parts
- a flame-proofing agent
quantity chosen as per desired degree of fire-resistance
Material as in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
graft ratio of the silane is such that the melt flow index of

the material obtained lies between 1 and 10 grams per 10
minutes at 190°C under a weight of 5 kg, and under the

conditions laid down by ISO standard 1133.
Material as in either of claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the silane is trimethoxy-vinyl- silane. 
Material as in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
flame-proofing agent is alumina trihydrate; and 
in that
 this
alumina trihydrate has a specific surface area of between 3

and 8 m
2
/g.
Material as in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
second ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer is grafted with

trimethoxy-vinyl-silane in a quantity such that the melt flow
index of the material obtained lies between 1 and 10 grams for

10 minutes at 190°C under a weight of 5 kg and under the
conditions provided by ISO 1133 standard.
