<ABSTRACT>
A photographic element including a support and first 
and second green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers 

of different sensitivity, wherein the layer of higher 
sensitivity includes a two-equivalent magenta dye-forming 

coupler selected from the group consisting of a 
pyrazolone coupler having a structure according to 

formula I and a pyrazoloazole coupler having a structure 
according to formula II as set forth in the disclosure, 

and the layer of lower sensitivity includes a two-equivalent 
magenta dye-forming coupler selected from the 

group consisting of couplers defined by formulas I and 
II. The activity of the magenta dye-forming coupler 

present in the layer of lower sensitivity is less than 
the activity of the coupler present in the layer of 

higher sensitivity. The layers of higher and lower 
sensitivity do not comprise magenta couplers which are 

defined by the same formula.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silver halide photographic 
materials having improved granularity and color 
saturation. In particular, the invention relates to a 
photographic element containing at least two separate 
layers of different sensitivity to green light, including 
a more active magenta coupler in the more sensitive layer 
and a less active magenta coupler in the less sensitive 
layer or layers, wherein one of said magenta couplers is 
a pyrazolone coupler and the other of said magenta 
couplers is a pyrazoloazole coupler. There is a continuing need in the photographic art 
to improve and optimize the attributes of the film, such 
as the image structure of the film. In particular, there 
is a desire to reduce the amount of "noise," or 
nonuniformity, in the developed film. The visual 
sensation produced by such nonuniformity is termed 
"graininess," while the objective measure of the 
nonuniformity is termed "granularity." See T.H. James, 
"The Theory of the Photographic Process," (4th ed. 1977), 
pp. 618-33). Preferably, reduction in the granularity of 
the developed film should be achieved without adversely 
affecting other photographic parameters, such as 
sensitivity to light (speed), latitude, sharpness, 
interimage effects, curve shape, D-max, and density. Various approaches to optimizing granularity are 
known in the art. Such approaches include: coating high 
concentrations of silver; reducing the size of grains in 
the film; and decreasing the full development of grains 
by the use of development inhibitors. The foregoing  
 
methods are not always desirable, however, since they 
require the coating of additional silver in order to 
obtain the desired curve shape and density. The use of 
more silver is additionally disadvantageous since it 
often results in increased light scattering, which 
degrades the performance of the underlying layers. 
Moreover, use of excess silver can result in difficulties 
in the removal (bleaching) of the silver from the 
developed film. Smearing couplers have also been used to reduce 
granularity. This method, however, often undesirably 
reduces the film sharpness. Another approach, use of couplers that generate low 
extinction dyes, involves the use of more silver, with 
the accompanying disadvantages discussed above. Another method, involving coating reduced amounts of 
couplers in the layers of the photographic element in 
order to "starve" the coupler, generally has a negative 
impact on D-max, curve shape, color saturation, and 
silver efficiency.
