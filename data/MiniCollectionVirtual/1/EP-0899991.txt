<ABSTRACT>
The high frequency discharge lamp is supplied by resonant coupling. A high frequency generator (G) provides the supply, and this alternating supply is adapted to the load formed by the discharge lamp (L) via a resonant circuit (A,C). A region of the lamp, situated between the points where the alternating potential is applied, is referenced to a set potential, which lies between the extremes of the applied alternating voltage. The reference potential is applied through a coupling element (Ec) placed in proximity to this zone. The alternating potential is adjustable to control the spectral response of the discharge lamp. The coupling element (Ec) is a metal plate or mesh placed inside the wall of the discharge lamp and excited from outside the lamp.
