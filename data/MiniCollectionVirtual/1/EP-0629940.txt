<ABSTRACT>
Device for detecting intrusion and suspicious users, for data-processing unit (1), and security system including such a device which utilises the surveillance data relating to the operation of the unit. The device includes means (01) for modelling the data-processing unit, its users and their respective behaviours with the aid of a semantic network (06); means (02) for comparing the modelled behaviour of the system and of the users with the modelled normal behaviour; means (03) for interpreting the anomalies noted in terms of intrusions and intrusion hypotheses; means (04) for interpreting the intrusion hypotheses and the intrusions noted so as to indicate them and enable contention actions to be prepared. Means (05) are provided for evaluating the degree of suspectness of the users. Together, the means cooperate with an informatory purpose.

A facility for detecting intrusions and possibly suspect users, in a computer

actions of the users of said installation, which streams are generated in the

installation, the facility being 
characterized in that
 it comprises:

first means (01) for modelling the target as constituted by said
computer installation (1) and its users and also their respective behaviors by

making use of previously acquired knowledge and rules and by means of a
symbolic representation using a semantic network (06);
second means (02) for comparing the modelled behavior of the
installation and its users with normal behavior expected for the same

conditions as modelled by the behavior rules and security rules contained in a
knowledge base belong to said second means, and for inferring therefrom

either an anomaly object in the event of at least one of the behavior rules
being violated, or an intrusion object or an intrusion hypothesis object in the

event of at least one of the security rules being violated;
third means (03) for interpreting the anomalies observed by
implementing the previously acquired rules and knowledge so as to generate,

reinforce, or confirm corresponding intrusion hypotheses;
fourth means (04) for correlating and interpreting intrusion hypotheses
and intrusions observed by implementing the previously acquired rules and

knowledge in order to link together various intrusion hypotheses and/or
intrusions, and to infer new intrusion hypotheses and/or intrusions therefrom;

and
communication means (00) co-operating with the various other means
(01 to 04) mentioned above for indicating the various data items that said

various means produce relating to behavior, anomalies, intrusion hypotheses,
and intrusions.
A facility for detecting intrusions according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

it includes fifth means (05) for using the previously acquired knowledge to
identify users who are actually responsible for anomalies, intrusion

hypotheses, and intrusions as established by the second, third, and/or fourth
means, to evaluate a corresponding degree of suspicion, and to indicate

which users are responsible in co-operation with the other means and via the
communication means (00). 
A facility for detecting intrusions according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in

the various means (01 to 04 or 05) implemented thereby are constituted by
expert systems that share a common inference engine, operating with forward

chaining, said engine being used in association with as many knowledge
bases as there are expert systems.
A facility for detecting intrusions according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 it further comprises:

an abstractor-investigator (11) provided with means (110 to 112) for
constructing an image of the behavior of the target, constituted by the

computer installation (1) and by its users, and for carrying out investigations in
the data bases (14 to 16) and the fact base (17) and also in the computer

installation (1);
an analyzer-checker (12) provided with means (120 to 129) for
interpreting the behavior of the computer installation and of its users with

reference to the target model which represents the knowledge contained in
the data and fact bases (14, 19 to 24, 17) in order to detect anomalies; and
a suspicion and reaction manager (13) provided with means (130 to
135) for interpreting the detected anomalies and intrusions, for identifying the

users actually responsible for anomalies and intrusions, for attributing a
degree of suspicion to at least one of said users so as to trigger

corresponding messages for transmission via a human-machine interface (4),
and optionally for triggering restraint measures applicable to the computer

installation (1) under human supervision via said human-machine interface.
A facility for detecting intrusions according to claim 4, 
characterized in that

it includes an abstractor-investigator (11) associating an audit abstractor (110)
responsible for creating a time and space image of the state and of the

behavior of the target constituted by the computer installation and its users,
and for interpreting on demand the data that results from investigation

requests, an audit investigator (111) responsible for searching data in a
central audit data base (15) of the facility and for acquiring surveillance data

on demand about the computer installation, and a behavior investigator (112)
responsible for looking for data for the analyzer-checker (12) and for the

suspicion and reaction manager (13) in the data and fact bases (14 to 16, 17)
