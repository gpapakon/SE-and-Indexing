<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus according to the present invention includes: a 
case (100) having at least six planes among which two (120,130) or more 

placement planes are usable as a bottom when placing the apparatus; a 
photosensitive body (1); an exposing device (400) for irradiating the 

photosensitive body with a light to form a latent image on the photosensitive 
body; a developing device (2) for developing the latent image formed on the 

photosensitive body to form a developer image; a transfer roller (500) for 
transferring the developer image on a recording paper; and a fixing device 

(600) for thermally fixing a transferred image on the recording paper after 
image transference. The fixing device is always above the photosensitive 

body, the developing device, and the exposing device, whichever plane is 

selected from the two or more placement planes as a bottom when placing the 
apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic 
image forming apparatus for use in a 
copying machine, a laser beam printer, or the like. In recent years, this type of device is 
popular among personal users, and a smaller device 
produced at lower cost is required for satisfying 
personal user's needs. In using such a small-sized apparatus, generally 
designed as a desk-top type, the user prefers to 
change its position or direction freely on the desk. 
The user wishes to make effective use of a limited desk 
space and to use the space in his or her own style. 
Therefore, it is desirable that the apparatus can be 
set in various attitudes by using the side or top 
planes of the body alternatively as a bottom supporting 
the apparatus body. However, a conventional image forming apparatus 
is generally large-sized, and when placing the 
apparatus on a desk or the like, the plane to be the 
bottom is predetermined. Accordingly, the apparatus 
has to be placed in one specific attitude. Therefore, 
in designing the structure of the developing device or 
positional arrangement of various elements in the body, 
the possibility of the apparatus being used in various 
attitudes is not taken into consideration.  If placing the apparatus using different 
planes as a bottom, the apparatus body is turned in 
various directions. The positional relationship among 
elements provided in the body and the direction of 
gravity influence vary in accordance with the change of 
placement direction, whereby the stream of the moving 
developer and air flow change in the apparatus body. 
As a result, the following problems occur. First, as for positional relationship among 
the elements, the elements located above a fixing 
device are heated by the air rising from the fixing 
device, which is a large heat source. This causes heat 
deformity and a change of characteristics in the elements. Secondly, in the case of using a laser scanner 
as an exposure means, due to the change of placement 
attitude of the body, the shaft of the motor for 
revolving the mirror used in the laser scanner may be 
slightly shifted from its proper position by the influence 
of gravity. As a result, the accuracy of scanning 
by laser light is reduced, and then the quality of the 
developed image is degraded. Further, in the developing device, the state 
of supplying developer changes depending on the gravity 
effect varying due to the change of the direction of 
supplying the developer to a photosensitive body. In 
such a state, an excessive
