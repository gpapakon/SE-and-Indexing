<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a terminal block for the electrical connection of electric power supply cables, comprising at least one electrical conductor having a high mechanical strength, especially for the supply of consumer (user) devices. This terminal block is of the type in which a connection device (2) is mounted between the two pre-stripped ends of the conductors (a, b). It is characterised in that each connection device (2) comprises at least two connection terminals (4, 5), each of which is connected to one of the conductor ends (a, b) and which are electrically connected together by a means (15) permitting relative displacement of one terminal with respect to the other. The invention can be used for public lighting lamp posts.
