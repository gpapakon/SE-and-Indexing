<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to synthetic fused 
silica especially for use in semiconductor applications. 
Particularly, this invention relates to synthetic fused 
silica for preparation of elongated fused quartz members. 
More particularly, this invention relates to synthetic 
silica for use in tubing and rods for semiconductors. Throughout the specification, numerous references 
will be made to the use of fused silica in semiconductor 
applications; however, it should be realized that the 
invention could be applied to many industries requiring 
synthetic fused silica having a higher than normal 
viscosity. Fused silica has been used in metal-halide, 
halogen and mercury lamps because of its excellent 
mechanical strengths and its ability to handle high 
operating temperatures. In addition, fused silica is 
becoming an important constituent of the ever-expanding 
semiconductor and fiber optics industries. Its high purity 
and resistance to high temperatures are particularly 
desirable characteristics. One difficulty in the use of fused quartz in the 
semiconductor industry is the level of impurities (30-50 
ppm by weight). Accordingly, synthetic silica has been 
experimented with as a replacement to natural silica for  
 
some applications. However, a difficulty often 
encountered in utilizing the synthetic material is its 
low viscosity. Although a low viscosity may benefit 
fabricators who rework fused silica products, many 
fabricators require a fused silica having a higher 
viscosity. The semiconductor industry is an example of 
an industry which requires a high viscosity, low impurity 
fused silica. US Patent No. 4047966 discloses a method of 
enhancing the refractoriness of high purity fused silica 
which is produced from a liquid flowable form of silica 
slurry or sol and the refractoriness of the fused silica 
is enhanced by homogeneously doping the silica with 
aluminum and/or titanium oxide, preferably in conjunction 
with elemental silicon. Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 116, Ref. No. 240607K 
(& JP-A-4046020) discloses glass prepared from fine SiO2 
powder, which is obtained by thermal hydrolysis of 
halogen-containing silicon compounds and is doped with 
5-40 ppm A1. The doping may be carried out during or 
after the hydrolysis. Preferably, the glass has slow-cooling 
point ≥ 1220° and contains ≤ 300 ppm OH and ≤ 1 
ppm heavy and alkali metals. JP-A-3193637 discloses a high purity quartz 
glass doped with 1-1,000 ppm aluminum. An object of this invention is to 
provide a new and improved process for
