<ABSTRACT>
A member having metal is placed in a gas-impermeable 
container in a hermetically sealed condition together with a 

rust-proof agent packet, and is bonded to another metal by 
using a filler material and without using a flux. 
It is desirable that a member having metal is placed and 
preserved in a gas-impermeable container in a hermetically 

sealed condition together with a rust-proof agent packet and 
an organic compound having carboxyl groups or aldehyde groups 

and having 4 to 10 carbons, and that the member having metal 
is bonded to another metal by using a filler material. 
The method of the present invention prevents, in an 
extremely simple way and at a low cost, the oxidation of the 

metal surface by retaining the member including metal under a 
reductive atmosphere in which no oxygen, moisture or corrosive 

substances actually exist, and in which reductive gas coexists 
with the member having metal. Moreover, the method of 

the present invention enables easy and good bonding of the 
member having metal to another metal by using a filler 

material. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to give a flux 
cleaning treatment using organic halogen-based solvents after 

the solder bonding, the cleaning steps may be simplified, and 
cost reduction may be promoted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for bonding a
member having metal with another member having metal or
another metal material by using a filler material, without
using a flux.More specifically, this invention relates to a method for
preventing the metal from being oxidized during the
preservation of the member having metal, and making the
bonding of the member having metal to the other member by
using a filler material possible, without using a flux.In more detail, this invention relates to a method for
bonding electronic parts, which is appropriate for the bonding
of electronic parts by using a filler material, and which is
to be applied when mounting an electronic part on a substrate.When a member including metal, such as various kinds of
electronic parts, is exposed to air during preservation or
transportation, the metal portion is easily oxidized, and the
metal surface will be covered with an oxide layer. Once the
oxide layer is formed in this way, it becomes difficult to
bond the metal portion of this member to the other metal
material or other member having metal by soldering or brazing.Accordingly, a postflux has been used to remove the oxide
layer on the metal surface. This postflux is a compound
containing a halogen activator, and is an agent which is
capable of removing the oxide layer on the metal surface when
it is applied to the member to be bonded by a filler material. However, there are some defects in the application of a
postflux to electronic parts, such as the corrosion of the
metal portion due to halogen compounds which remain on the
metal portion of the electronic parts, and the deterioration
of electrical insulation of the electronic parts.Therefore, it has been necessary to clean the electronic
parts with a solution containing an organic halogen based
solvent, such as freon, or a surface active agent.However, the technology of cleaning electronic parts also
has the following defects:First, halogen based solvents such as freon compounds
including trichlorofluoromethane, trihaloethane and
trihalomethan have a problem that they may destroy an ozone
layer of the earth. The manufacture and use of these halogen
based solvents is limited or is going to be limited by
international treaties.Secondly, when cleaning electronic parts with a solution
containing a surface active agent, the waste water containing
heavy metals and organic substances must be treated. It is
also necessary to dry the electronic parts, thereby increasing
costs.Based on the above-described background, a flux
