<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compounds useful as
inhibitors of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), to
their preparation and to pharmaceutical and veterinary
compositions containing them.Plasminogen activators (PAs) are serine proteases
which control the activation of the zymogen, plasminogen,
to the active enzyme plasmin. Plasmin is important in a
number of physiological and pathological processes
including fibrinolysis, tissue remodelling, tumour growth
and metastasis. The glycoprotein plasminogen activator
inhibitor (PAI) is an endogenous fast-acting inhibitor of
PA activity. PAI is a member of the serpin family and is
synthesised by a variety of cells including endothelial
cells. An imbalance between PAs and PAI contributes to a
number of pathological conditions including haemostasis,
inflammation, tumour growth and metastasis.The present invention provides the use of a
diketopiperazine of formula (A):

wherein each of R1 to R10, which may be the same or
different, is independently selected from hydrogen, C1-C6
alkyl unsubstituted or substituted by one or more halogen
atoms, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio, halogen, hydroxy,
nitro, optionally substituted phenyl, cyano, -CH2OH,
-CH2COOH, -CO2R11, -NHCOR11, -NHSO2R13, -SO2R13, -CON(R1'R12),
-SOR13, -SO2N(R11R12), -N(R11R12), -O(CH2)nN(R11R12),
-O(CH2)nCO2R11, -OCOR11, -CH2OCOR11, -CH2NHCOR11, -CH2NHCOOR13,
-CH2SR11,-CH2SCOR11, -CH2S(O)mR13 wherein m is 1 or 2,
-CH2NHCO(CH2)nCO2R11, -N(R11)COR12, -NHCOCF3, -NHCO(CH2)nCO2R11, 
-NHCO(CH2)nOCOR11 and -NHCO(CH2)nOR11 wherein n is 0 or is an
integer of from 1 to 6, each of R11 and R12 is independently
H or C1-C6 alkyl and R13 is C1-C6 alkyl; or any of R1 and R2,
R2 and R3, R3 and R4 and R4 and R5, or R6 and R7, R7 and R8, R8
and R9 and R9 and R10, form together with the carbon atoms
to which they are attached a benzene ring which is
optionally substituted; or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt or ester thereof; in the manufacture of a medicament
for use as an inhibitor of plasminogen activator inhibitor.The numerals 1 to 10 denote ring positions on the
phenyl groups in formula A. The letters a and b refer to
the two phenyl rings themselves.When any two adjacent groups of R1 to R10 form,
together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached,
a benzene ring, that ring is either unsubstituted or it may
be substituted by any of the options specified above for R1
to R10. The benzene ring forms, together with ring a or b
respectively, an optionally substituted naphthalene ring
structure.When ring a or b
