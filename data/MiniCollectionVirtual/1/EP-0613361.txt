Disposable absorbent article of hygiene such as 
a nappy, exhibiting a substantially rectangular general 

shape with opposed lengthwise edges (8) and opposed 
transverse edges (7) and comprising, from the outside 

inwards, a liquid-impervious support sheet (4), an 
absorbent pad (6) arranged and fastened to the inner face 

of the support sheet, the dimensions of the pad being 
smaller than those of the support sheet, a liquid-permeable 

cover sheet (5) at least partially covering the 
inner face of the absorbent pad and fastened at least 

partially to the support sheet on the periphery of the 
absorbent pad, lengthwise elastic members (13) fastened 

in the stretched state to the support sheet, outside the 
lengthwise edges (11) of the absorbent pad, two transversely 

spaced side flaps (16) arranged on the inner face 
of the cover sheet, along the lengthwise edges (8) of the 

article of hygiene, each of the said flaps (16) having a 
proximal edge (18) connected to the cover sheet (5) and 

a distal edge (21) comprising stretched lengthwise 
elastic members (22), each of the said flaps (16) being 

fastened to the cover sheet (5) along its proximal edge 
(18), over the whole length of the article of hygiene, in 

the vicinity of one of the transverse edges of the 
article of hygiene, for closing the latter around a 

user's waist so that the article of hygiene defines a 
front part (2) and a rear part (1) corresponding 

respectively to the two end regions near the said opposed 
transverse edges (7) of the article of hygiene, and a 

crotch part (3) corresponding to the intermediate region 
situated between the two said end regions, characterized 

in that: 

the said proximal edge (18) is above the absorbent pad 
(6), over the whole length of the article of hygiene, 

including in the crotch part, and fastening means (14); 
each flap (16) is folded back onto itself, over its 
whole length, along a fold line (20) situated between the 

proximal edge (18) and the distal edge (21); 
each flap (16) is fastened flat in this folded-back  
 

position to the cover sheet (5): 
 
laterally at the ends (1,2) of the article by transverse 

lines or strips (23,24),
 
lengthwise only by its proximal edge (18), so that its 

elasticized distal edge (21) is situated substantially 
above its proximal edge (18), over the whole length of 

the flap, by virtue of which the free edge of each of the 
flaps (16) opens to form an elasticized pouch (25). 
Article of hygiene according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each flap (16) is folded back onto 

itself outwards. 
Article of hygiene according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each flap (16) is folded back onto 

itself inwards. 
Article of hygiene according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the two flaps 

(16) consist of two tapes (17) separated by an interval. 
Article of hygiene according to any one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the two flaps (16) consist 

of a single tape (26) whose two side edges (21), defining 
the distal edges of the flaps, are elasticized and which 

is fastened to the cover sheet (5) by two lengthwise 
lines (19) set back inwards in relation to said side 

edges and defining the proximal edges of the flaps, at 
least a middle part (27) of the tape (26), which are 

situated between the said fastening lines (19) being 
permeable to liquids. 
Article of hygiene according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that said tape (26) consists of a 

liquid-permeable tissue, for example a nonwoven, which is 
hydrophilic in said middle part (27) and hydrophobic or 

impervious to liquids in said side parts (28). 
Article of hygiene according to any one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the cover sheet consists of 

a liquid-permeable tape (29) of a width slightly greater 
than the width of the pad (6) in the crotch part (3) 

covering the absorbent pad (6), and in that each of the 
two flaps (16) consists of a single piece with a side 

tape (30) which, on each side of the nappy, covers the  
 

parts of the support sheet (4) and of the pad (6) which 
are not covered by the middle tape (29), is fastened to 

the middle tape (29) by a lengthwise line (19) situated 
above the pad (6) defining the said proximal edge of the 

flap and is extended beyond said line (19) in the form of 
a flap (16) folded back onto itself. 
Article of hygiene according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that each side tape (30) consists of a 

hydrophobic or liquid-impervious tissue.
