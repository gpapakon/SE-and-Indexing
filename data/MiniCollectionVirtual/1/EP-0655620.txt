<ABSTRACT>
A sensor (100) for measuring semiconductor wafer 
(10) temperature in semiconductor processing equipment 

(30), comprising a first laser (104) to provide a first 
laser beam at a first wavelength and a second laser (106) 

to provide a second laser beam at a second wavelength. 
The sensor also includes laser driver (108) and 

oscillator (110) to modulate the wavelength of the first 
and second laser beams as the laser beams are directed to 

and reflected from the wafer (10), and detector module 
(130) to measure the change in specular reflectance of 

the wafer (10) resulting from the modulation of the 
wavelength of the first and second laser beams. The 

sensor system also includes signal processing circuitry 
(138) to determine rms surface roughness of wafer (10) at 

a known reference temperature from the change in 
reflectance of wafer (10) resulting from modulation of 

the wavelengths of the first and second laser beams, and 
to determine the temperature of wafer (10) from the 

change in specular reflectance of wafer (10) resulting 
from modulation of the wavelengths of the first and 

second laser beams while wafer (10) is at an unknown 
temperature and the surface roughness of the wafer at the 

known temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to real-time
temperature measurement of a workpiece
and more particularly to a method and
apparatus for semiconductor wafer
temperature measurements based on surface roughness
induced scattering of laser beams. Integrated circuit chip manufacturers fabricate
semiconductor devices by different combinations of
fabrication processes. Wafer temperature is an important
parameter for many of these processes. More
specifically, precise measurement and control of wafer
temperature and its uniformity are required in order to
minimize deviations from the target process parameters
and increase device fabrication yield. Thermal
fabrication processes, such as thermal anneals,
oxidation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are
examples of processes where wafer temperature is an
important process parameter. Currently, thermocouples
are used to measure wafer temperature during plasma etch
operations such as reactive ion etch (RIE).
Additionally, some chemical vapor deposition processes,
such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)
employ thermocouples for temperature measurement.Thermocouples for measuring temperature in
semiconductor fabrication equipment have substantial
disadvantages. For instance, thermocouples can be
disturbed by the RF and electromagnetic fields (e.g.,
13.56 MHz RF and 2.45 GHz microwave) used to generate
plasma during plasma etch processing. Thermocouples are
also invasive in that they must be placed very near the
location where the temperature is being measured. In
some applications the thermocouples may require actual
contact with the wafer surface for accurate temperature
sensing, thereby causing disturbance of the wafer
temperature and also possible wafer contamination.
Furthermore, most thermocouples suffer from measurement
error and slow response time problems.Pyrometry providing for non-contact operation can
also be used to measure wafer temperature in some thermal 
processing applications such as rapid thermal processing
(RTP). Computational pyrometry sensors, however, have
several disadvantages. For example, for accurate
pyrometry-based temperature measurements, an accurate
knowledge of the spectral emissivity of the wafer at the
pyrometry measurement wavelength band is required. It is
known that spectral emissivity can vary with various
parameters, such as wafer temperature, wafer resistivity,
material layers, and their thickness, and process chamber
geometry and materials, making pyrometry sensors
relatively inaccurate due to
