<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for girding an article with a strip of adhesive tape, whereof ends can adhere to one another, which device comprises: a housing with a cavity for accomodating a supply roll of adhesive tape; a cutting knife (18); a star wheel (10) rotatable with light friction having a number of recesses; a channel (8) wherethrough an article for girding has to be moved from the open side, wherein the star wheel is formed and positioned in relation to the channel such that an article for girding engages onto the star wheel in a recess thereof adheringly carrying with it the first tape, the opening of which recess is situated in the region of the slits, whereby the star wheel is set into rotation so that in the recess the article is girded with adhesive tape with the progressive rotation of the star wheel, and a movable positioning arm (25) coupled to the knife which, in the position wherein the knife severs the tape, engages with its free end into a recess in the star wheel, whereby this star wheel is positioned such that another recess is situated in the region of the channel and is ready to receive an article for girding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for girding an 
article with a strip of adhesive tape, whereof ends can 
adhere to one another, which device comprises: 
a housing with a cavity for accommodating a supply 
roll of adhesive tape with: 
means for guiding the tape; means for carrying an article at least along and 
against the adhesive side of the adhesive tape; and cutting means actuable by a through-fed article for 
severing the tape after the article has passed over 
the said means, a star wheel rotatable with light friction having a 
number of spokes bounding identical, substantially radial 
recesses disposed at mutually equal angular distances, two mutually registered slits open on one side which 
are present in the front wall and the rear wall respectively 
of the housing and which together bound a channel 
wherethrough an article for girding has to be moved from the 
open side, wherein the adhesive tape is guided over the top part 
of the star wheel with the sticking side facing outward, wherein the star wheel is formed and positioned 
relative to the slits such that an article for girding 
engages onto the star wheel in a recess thereof adheringly 
carrying with it the adhesive tape, the opening of which 
recess is situated in the region of the slits, whereby the 
star wheel is set into rotation so that in the recess the 
article is girded with adhesive tape with the progressive 
rotation of the star wheel, and wherein the cutting means are placed downstream in 
relation to the star wheel and comprise a tilt piece with an 
actuating part movable pivotally about a pivot axis toward 
and away from the channel, which tilt piece is urged by 
spring means to a rest position wherein the cutting knife is 
located at a distance from the channel and the actuating part  
 
is located in the region of the channel for actuating of the 
tilt piece by an article carried through the channel while 
severing the tape wherewith an article is girded. The invention has for its object to provide a device, the 
operation of which is substantially independent of the 
dimensions of a through-fed article. A derived object of the 
invention in this respect is to provide a device which is for 
instance suitable for sealing plastic waste bags and binding 
bunches of flowers. A problem with such a device known from WO-A-91/02682 is 
that the positioning of the star wheel can be greatly dependent 
on the thickness of a through-fed article. During 
girding of an article the star wheel has to be positioned 
such that a following

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for girding an article (15) with a strip of 
adhesive tape (6), whereof ends can adhere to one another, 

which device (1) comprises: 

a housing (4) with a cavity (3) for accommodating a 
supply roll (5) of adhesive tape (6) with: 


means for guiding the tape; 
means for carrying an article at least along and 
against the adhesive side of the adhesive tape (6); 

and 
cutting means (17, 18) actuable by a through-fed 
article (15) for severing the tape (6) after the 

article has passed over the said means, 
a star wheel (10) rotatable with light friction having 
a number of spokes (9) bounding identical, substantially 

radial recesses (11) disposed at mutually equal angular 
distances, 
two mutually registered slits open on one side which 
are present in the front wall and the rear wall respectively 

of the housing and which together bound a channel (8) 
wherethrough an article (15) for girding has to be moved from 

the open side (7) , 
wherein the adhesive tape (15) is guided over the top 
part of the star wheel with the sticking side facing outward, 
wherein the star wheel (10) is formed and positioned 
relative to the slits such that an article (15) for girding 

engages onto the star wheel (10) in a recess (11) thereof 
adheringly carrying with it the adhesive tape (6), the 

opening of which recess (11) is situated in the region of the 
slits, whereby the star wheel (10) is set into rotation so 

that in the recess (11) the article (15) is girded with 
adhesive tape ( 15) with the progressive rotation of the star 

wheel (10), and 
wherein the cutting means (17, 18) are placed 
downstream in relation to the star wheel (10) and comprise a 

tilt piece (17) with an actuating part (16) movable pivotally
