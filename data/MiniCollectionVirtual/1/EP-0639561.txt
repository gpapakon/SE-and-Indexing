<ABSTRACT>
Alkyl 3-chlorophenyl sulphones are particularly advantageously obtained by chlorination by alkyl phenyl sulphones if alkyl phenyl sulphones are chlorinated in molten form with elemental chlorine and in the presence of iron(III) chloride and optionally iodine and/or sulphur.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing alkyl-(3-chlorophenyl)-sulphones 
by chlorination of alkylphenylsulphones, 

characterized in that alkylphenylsulphones are 
chlorinated in molten form with elemental chlorine 

in the presence of iron(III) chloride. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
alkyl-(3-chlorophenyl)-sulphones of the formula (I) 


 
in which 


R
1
 and R
2
are identical or different and represent 
a straight-chain or branched C
1
- to 
C
4
-alkyl group, 
 
are prepared from alkylphenylsulphones of the 

formula (II) 

 
in which 


R
1
 and R
2
have the meanings specified for formula 
(I). 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that p-methyl-(3-chlorophenyl)-methylsulphone is 

prepared from p-methylphenyl-methylsulphone. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that it is carried out at from 80 to 180Â°C. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that chlorine is passed in until at least 90% by 

weight of the alkylphenylsulphone used have been 
converted. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that it is carried out in the additional presence of 

iodine and/or sulphur. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
iron(III) chloride alone or iron(III) chloride plus 

iodine and/or sulphur are each used in amounts of 
from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on alkylphenylsulphone 

used. 
Process according to Claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that the weight ratio of iron(III) chloride to 

iodine and/or sulphur is from 0.1:1 to 10:1. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that after carrying out the process of the invention 

residual chlorine is blown out of the reaction 
vessel. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the product obtained is purified by washing 

with water, distillation, fractionation and/or 
recrystallization.
