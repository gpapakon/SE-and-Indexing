<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to complex compounds of 
tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane and to mixtures 
containing the borane complexes and an organometallic 
complex that are useful as catalysts for 
polymerization 
and copolymerization of olefins and to polymeric 
products prepared using these catalysts. Use of soluble Ziegler-Natta type catalyst 
systems in the polymerization of olefins, in 
particular polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene 
is known in the art. In general, traditional Ziegler-Natta 
type systems comprise a transition metal halide 
activated to form a catalyst species by reaction with 
a metal alkyl cocatalyst, particularly aluminum alkyl 
cocatalysts. However, aluminum alkyl cocatalysts are 
often used in large excess, see U.S. Patent No. 
4,404,344. This is disadvantageous because the 
aluminum compounds must be removed from the resultant 
polymers. These traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
often contain a variety of different active sites, 
each of which has its own rate of initiation, 
propagation, and termination. As a consequence of 
this non-uniformity of active sites, the linear 
polyethylene has a broad molecular weight 
distribution. See for example, Comprehensive 
Organometallic Chemistry; Wilkinson, G., Ed.; Pergamon 
Press: Oxford, 1982; Vol. 3, Chapter 22.5, p 475; 
Transition Metals and Organometallics as Catalysts for 
Olefin Polymerization; Kaminsky, W. and Sinn, H., 
Eds.; Springer-Verlag: New York, 1988, and Transition 
Metal Catalyzed Polymerizations: Alkenes and Dienes;  
 
Quirk, R.P., Ed.; Harwood: New York 1983. Recently, catalysts have been reported that rely 
on boron rather than on aluminum-containing compounds. 
Boron-based catalysts, in contrast to the aluminum-based 
catalysts, are often stoichiometric in boron. 
That is, they contain one mole of boron-containing 
component per mole of transition metal. Furthermore, 
it is usually unnecessary to remove the small amount 
of boron from the polymer, unlike the aluminum-based 
catalysts, mentioned above. Tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (C6F5)3B forms 1:1 
complexes with Lewis bases such as ether, amines, and 
phosphines. The compound is hygroscopic and, 
presumably forms a monohydrate but neither the 
composition, that is stoichiometry of this hydrate nor 
its properties have been disclosed. No uses for these 
donor-acceptor complexes have been taught, see Massey 
et al. J. Organomet. Chem. 1964, 2, 245. Hygroscopic 
(C6F3)3B-Et2O was reported by Pohlman et al. Z Nat. 
1965, 20b, 5.Hlatky et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc.
