<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for drawing metal blanks (1) for the manufacture of so-called deep-drawn components. The process consists in clamping the peripheral part of the metal blank (1) between a die (2) and a blank holder (4), in applying a drawing force to the die (2) and simultaneously in applying a retaining force to the blank holder (4), this retaining force being opposed to and less than the drawing force in order to obtain the final depth of the pressing, in applying a reduced retaining force to the blank holder (4), this reduced retaining force being between a fifth and a half of the said retaining force in order to obtain a first pressing of a depth lying between a fifth and a third of the final depth. The subject of the invention is also a device for drawing metal blanks for the implementation of the process.

A process for drawing metal blanks (1) for making parts called deep drawn parts, according to
which process:


the metal blank (1) is placed between a die (2) and a peripheral blank clamp (4) slidably
mounted round a punch (5),

- the peripheral part of the metal blank (1) is clamped between the die (2) and the blank clamp
(4),
a drawing force is applied to the die (2) and a holding force opposed to but smaller than the
drawing force is simultaneously applied to the blank clamp (4), so as to obtain the final depth P

of the drawn part,

characterized in that:
a reduced holding force is applied to the blank clamp (4), lying between a fifth and half the said
holding force so as obtain a first drawn part of depth P1 lying between a fifth and a third of the

final depth P,
then the said holding force is applied to the blank clamp (4) to obtain the said final depth P of
the drawn part.
A device for drawing a metal blank (1) for implementing the process according to claim 1, of the
type comprising:


a punch (5) fixed on a base (6),
a die (2) and a peripheral blank clamp (4) adapted to cooperate to clamp the peripheral part of
the metal blank (1) and mounted slidably about the punch (5),
a first press ram (3) for applying a drawing force to the die (2) to obtain the final depth P of the
drawn part,
and means (10) for transmitting a holding force opposed to the drawing force to the blank clamp
(4), the said transmitting means being formed by a second press ram (11) and by 
a plurality of
regularly distributed vertical columns (12) passing through the base (6), one end (12a) referred to

as the lower end of the columns (12) being adapted to cooperate with the said second press ram
(11) located below the said base (6) and an upper end (12b) of the columns (12) being adapted to

cooperate with the peripheral blank clamp (4), characterized in that it comprises means (15) for
transmitting a reduced holding force to the blank clamp (4), lying between a fifth and half the

holding force, to obtain a first drawn part of depth P1 lying between a fifth and a third of the
final depth P of the drawn part, the said blank clamp (4) cooperating firstly with the said 

transmitting means (15) during the application of the said reduced holding force and secondly
with the second press ram (11) through the columns (12) during the application of the said

holding force.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the means (15) transmitting the reduced
holding force to the blank clamp (4) are formed by elastic members (16).
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that one of the said elastic members (16) is
interposed between the end (12b) referred to as the upper end of each column (12) and the blank

clamp (4), one end of each elastic member (16) being fixed under the blank clamp (4) and the
other end of the said elastic member (16) being fixed on a shoulder (17) formed on the said

column (12).
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the said elastic members (16) are interposed
between the two elements (20a, 20b) of a supporting table (20) located between the base (6) and

the second press ram (11), the upper element (20a) of the supporting table (20) being integral
with the ends (12a) referred to as the lower ends of the columns (12) and the lower element (20a)

of the said supporting table (20) being integral with the said second press ram (11).
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the second press ram (11) is provided with at
least one substantially vertical element (11a) which abuts the base (6) when the elastic members

(16) are compressed.
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that the said substantially vertical element (11a)
is formed by an annular wall formed on the peripheral edge of the second press ram (11).
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the peripheral blank clamp (4) is formed
from two parts (40 and 41), an upper part (40) being in contact with the metal blank (1) and a

lower part (41) being integral with the ends (12a) referred to as the upper ends of the columns
(12), and in that the elastic members (16) are interposed between the two parts (40, 41) forming

the peripheral blank clamp (4).
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the two parts (40, 41) forming the peripheral
blank clamp (4) are interconnected by at least one spacer element (42). 
A device according to claim 9, characterized in that each spacer element (42) is formed by a
