<ABSTRACT>
In a VAD method for making optical fiber preforms, the yield is 
increased by terminating or significantly reducing the supply of glass raw material to 

the torch (24) just after glass jacket soot (23, FIG. 4) has been deposited at the 
bottom end of the glass rod (20). The fuel supply to the torch is maintained, 

however, and the flame continues to be projected from the torch toward the deposited 
soot boule (23). The rate of vertical movement of the glass rod is increased until the 

flame is directed at the bottom end (27') of the soot boule. The flame is then allowed 
to dwell for a sufficient period to increase significantly the temperature of the bottom 

end of the soot boule and to consolidate partially the bottom end of the soot boule. 
This has the effect of containing the soot and countering the effects of gravity on the 

delicate soot boule that might otherwise cause it to crack.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for making optical fiber and, more 
particularly, to methods for depositing jacket soot on a glass rod by the VAD 
process. Optical waveguides are disclosed in general, e.g., in U.S. Patent 
3,157,726 issued to Hicks, et al. Also, see publications "Cylindrical Dielectric 
Waveguide Modes" by E. Snitzer, Journal of the Optical Society of America, Vol. 
51, No. 5, pp. 491-498, May 1961 and "Fiber Optics - Principles and Applications" 
by N.S. Kapany, Academic Press, 1967. Methods of forming optical waveguides are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
3,711,262, U.S. Patent 3,737,292, U.S. Patent 4,062,665 and the publication 
"Continuous Fabrication of High Silica Fiber Preform" by T. Izawa, et al., 1977 
International Conference on Integrated Optics and Optical Fiber Communication, 
July 18-20, 1977, Tokyo Japan, Technical Digest, pp. 375-377. Also, EP-A-0 018 
704 discloses a method of forming a substantially continuous optical fiber preform 
material. Similarly, JP-A-63206324 discloses improvements in the production of 
optical fiber preforms. One of the steps in making glass optical fiber by the vapor axial 
deposition (VAD) method is the step of depositing glass particles or "jacket soot" on 
a glass core rod. This is done by supplying to a torch glass raw material and fuel 
such that the torch projects the vaporised glass raw material within a flame toward 
the glass rod. The flame causes the raw material to react such as to deposit glass 
particles or glass soot on the core rod. The core rod typically extends vertically with 
the initial deposition at its upper end. It is then moved vertically and rotated so that 
glass soot is deposited along its entire length and circumference. After deposition, 
the soot surrounding the core rod or the "soot boule" is consolidated or sintered in a 
furnace to form a glass preform. The preform is typically elongated and thereafter is 
used as a source from which optical fiber is drawn. Optical fiber is very widely used and, as a consequence, significant 
efforts have been made to reduce production costs. The step of making the jacket 
layer as described above can result in cracking of the soot boule, which may render 
the entire structure useless. There is therefore a continuing need for increasing the 
yield of methods for making optical fiber preforms without significantly increasing 
the cost or the time required for making such preforms.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a method as defined 
in claim 1. In a VAD

<CLAIMS>
A vapor axial deposition method for making optical fiber preforms comprising 
the steps of: 


supplying to a torch (24) glass-forming raw material (26) and a fuel (25), and 
projecting glass-forming raw material within a flame from said torch; 
directing the flame at a vertically extending glass rod (20) having top and bottom 
ends, the flame temperature and glass-forming raw material projected being appropriate 

to cause glass particles (23) to collect on the glass rod to form a glass soot boule; 
the torch initially being near a top end of the glass rod; 
moving the glass rod with respect to the torch in an axial vertically upward 

direction
 
to allow substantially the entire length thereof to be covered with deposited glass 

particles; characterized by: 
when the bottom end of the glass rod reaches a position near the torch, 
significantly reducing or terminating the supply of the glass-forming raw material to the 

torch while maintaining the fuel supply to the torch and the flame projected from the 
torch, thereby to increase the temperature of the soot boule near the bottom end of the 

glass rod and to make the density of the soot boule near the bottom end thereof greater 
than the average soot density of the soot boule. 
The method of claim 1 wherein
 
the glass rod comprises a core rod portion and a dummy rod portion extending axially 

downwardly from the core rod portion. 
The method of claim 1 wherein
 
   the raw material and flame are projected from a tip end of the torch;
 
   the glass particles are deposited both vertically above and below the tip end of the 

torch on the glass rod;
 
   and the step of reducing or terminating the supply of the glass-forming raw 

material occurs when the tip of the torch is above the bottom end of the glass rod.  
 
The method of claim 1 wherein
 
   after the glass rod has been raised to a vertical location at which the bottom end 

thereof is at about the same height as the tip of the torch, and after the significant 
reduction or termination in the supply of glass-forming raw material, the vertical 

movement of the glass rod is terminated, and the flame is allowed to dwell at a position 
corresponding to the bottom end of the glass rod, thereby to increase further the 

temperature of the bottom end of the soot boule. 
The method of claim 1 wherein
 
   after the termination of the glass-forming raw material supplied to the torch, the 

vertical movement of the glass rod is increased until the bottom of the soot boule is 
approximately the same height as the torch, whereafter the flame is allowed to dwell on 

the bottom end of the soot boule, thereby to raise the temperature of the soot boule.  
 
The method of claim 5 wherein
 
   the flame is allowed to dwell for a sufficient length of time to increase the 

temperature of the bottom end of the soot boule by more than 148.89°C (300°F) from its 
temperature at the time the glass-forming raw material is terminated. 
The method of claim 6 wherein
 
   the glass particles at the bottom end of the glass rod are heated by the flame to a 

temperature of 754.44°C (1390°F) to 954.44°C (1750°F). 
The method of claim 1 wherein
 
   as the glass rod is moved upwardly, it is rotated.
