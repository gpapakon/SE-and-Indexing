<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a complex formed between a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and an ion-exchange resin, for the treatment of gastric disorders, which compositions enhance the residence time of the drug within the stomach and promote local absorption by releasing the drug from the complex in a controlled manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
COMPOSITIONS BASED ON HISTAMINE H2-RECEPT0R ANTAGONISTS AND CATIONIC EXCHAN¬ GERS COMPLEXESThis invention relates to the treatment of gastric disorders and pharmaceutical compositions for use therein. More particularly the invention relates to the local 5 treatment of gastric disorders, especially acute gastric disorders such as acid indigestion, heartburn and gastritis, and gastric and peptic ulcer, using orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions comprising a histamine H2-receptor antagonist contained within a drug delivery system. Compositions for use in the invention are specifically adapted to provide local delivery across the stomach wall to 0 the H2-receptor on the parietal cell.Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, for example cimetidine, ranitidine, nizetidine and famotidine, reduce acid secretion by acting directly on the acid-secreting parietal cell located within the gastric gland of the stomach wall. Histamine H2-receptor 5 antagonists are widely used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity.Oral dosing is the preferred route for administration of histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as cimetidine and ranitidine. However, these substances have a 0 pronounced bitter taste which is disadvantageous in promoting patient compliance. Various methods have been described for masking the bitter taste associated with drug substances, including histamine H2-receptor antagonists. These methods include the use of ion-exchange resins.5 GB 2 218 333-A and EP-A-0 431 759 (Glaxo) describe compositions in which the bitter taste of ranitidine is masked by forming an adsorbate with a synthetic cation exchange resin.JP 1 242 522-A (Fujisawa) describes the preparation of a taste-masking suspension 30 containing cimetidine adsorbed onto a cation exchange resin.Current treatments using histamine H2-receptor antagonists act systemically, i.e. the histamine H2-receptor antagonist is delivered to the parietal cell receptor from the blood. It has recently been shown that histamine H2-receptor antagonist compositions 35 can be formulated to promote local delivery of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist directly through the stomach wall. 

International Patent Application Publication No. WO 92/00102 (Beecham Group) describes oral treatment of gastric disorders using a histamine H2-receptor antagonist in combination with an antacid to promote local delivery of the histamine H2- receptor antagonist to the receptor of the parietal cell wall. It has been demonstrated that

 C AIMS
1. The use of an orally administrable pharmaceutical composition comprising a drug/ion-exchange complex formed between a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and a cationic ion-exchange resin, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of gastric disorders, characterised in that the histamine H2-receptor antagonist is released from the stomach in a controlled manner whereby residence time of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist in the stomach is prolonged and local absorption of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist through the stomach wall is enhanced.
2. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a drug/ion-exchange complex formed between a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and a cationic ion-exchange resin, further comprising a material which prolongs the residence time of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist within the stomach.
3. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a drug/ion-exchange complex formed between a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and a cationic ion-exchange resin, further comprising a buffering component
4. A composition as claimed in claim 2 or 3 wherein the histamine H2- receptor antagonist is cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.
5. A composition as claimed in claim 4 wherein the histamine H2-receptor antagonist is cimetidine.
6. A composition as claimed in claim 5 wherein the dose level of cimetidine is from 1 to 800mg per dosage form.
7. A composition as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 6 wherein the histamine H2-receptor antagonist content of the drug-resin complex is up to 50% by weight.
8. A composition as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 7 wherein the ion- exchange resin has a polystyrene polymer matrix with suphonic acid groups and vinyl group cross-linking.
9. A composition as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 8 wherein the drug/ion- exchange resin complex has a particle size no greater than 120μm. 


10. A composition as claimed in claim 2 or any one of claims 4 to 9 when dependent on claim 2 wherein the material which prolongs the residence time of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist within the stomach is a bulking agent or a bioadhesive material.
11. A composition as claimed in claim 10 wherein the material which prolongs the residence time of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist within the stomach is sucralfate.
12. A composition as claimed in claim 3 or in any one of claims 4 to 11 when dependent on claim 3 wherein the buffering component is present in an amount which confers a gastric pH of no less than 3.5, or a gastric pH no less than 4 pH units below the pKa of the histamine H2-receptor antagonist.
13. A composition as claimed in claim 3 or in any one of claims 4 to 12 when dependent on claim 3 wherein the buffering component is an antacid.
14. A composition as claimed in claim 13 wherein the composition is buffered with aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide-magnesium carbonate co-dried gel, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, bismuth carbonate, magnesium aluminium silicate, alkali metal salts of citric, tartaric, benzoic, sorbic or phosphoric acid, or combinations of any of the aforementioned antacids.
