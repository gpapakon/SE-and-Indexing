<ABSTRACT>
Polyester-carbonate resins blended with a 
fibrous reinforcing agent, an impact-modifier and 

optionally a flame-retarding agent are used to mold 
articles such as structural panels. The articles 

exhibit improved impact-resistance without 
significant loss of elastic modulus and fire-retardancy. 
Preferred are polyester-carbonates based on a bisphenol and 
dodecanedioic acid blended with glass fibres, an oligocarbonate of 

bisphenol-A and tetrabromobisphenol-A as a flame retardant and an 
impact-modifier selected from the group of MBS, LLDPE, 

ethylene-ethylacrylate copolymer and a polysiloxane-polycarbonate block 
copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic molding
compositions and more particularly to molding
compositions which are formulated from polyester-carbonate
resins.Polyester-carbonates [also known as "copoly(ester-carbonates)"
or "polyester-polycarbonates"]
are a well known class of thermoplastic resin as is
their preparation; see for example the descriptions
given in U.S. Patents 3,169,121 and 4,487,896.Polyester-carbonate (PEC) resins have been
useful thermoplastic molding resins, to mold
particular articles of certain physical properties.
In general, the polyester-carbonate resins have had
limited use for molding some articles, being
characterized as yielding molded articles having
little resistance to impact when subjected to
testing for notched Izod impact strengths.In the U.S. Patent 4,393,161 to Van Abeelen et
al (July 12, 1983) there is a suggestion that by
incorporating fibrous reinforcement materials (such
as glass fibers) into polycarbonate resins,
including polyester-carbonate resins, one can
improve certain physical properties of articles
molded therefrom. For example, elastic modulus is
dramatically improved. However, it is said, that
"this always results in a serious deterioration in
overall ductility, manifested in poor notched and
unnotched impact strength". It is then related
that if one adds a conventional impact modifier to 
the blend, "there is a detrimental effect on
stiffness (modulus) strength". To improve impact
strength with a polystyrene resin impact-modifier
and "almost full retention of the elastic modulus"
Van Abeelen et al teaches the use of unsized glass
fibers as the reinforcement, and the addition of
minor proportions of poly C1-C10 alkyl (or phenyl)
hydrogen siloxanes "having a substantial content of
Si-H bonds". We have confirmed the teachings of
Van Abeelen et al., in respect to polycarbonate
homopolymers. However, we have now found that
particular polyester-carbonate resin based molding
blends containing fibrous reinforcement and a so-called
"conventional" impact modifier (not
necessarily a polystyrene resin), can be used to
thermally mold articles exhibiting acceptable
elastic modulus and high impact strength (with
other desired properties), without addition of the
above-described polysiloxane ingredient. The
improvement is particularly advantageous in respect
to aromatic polyester-carbonate resins having
aliphatic diester chain units. This improvement is
unexpected, in view of the prior art teachings and
further does not detract from flame retardance when
flame
