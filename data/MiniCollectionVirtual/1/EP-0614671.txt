<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of an absorbent material 
containing a superabsorbent polymer is disclosed herein. The 

processing steps include: providing a matrix material in a 
suitable solvent; mixing particles of a superabsorbent polymer 

into said solutioned matrix material to form a suspension; 
homogenizing the suspension; and removing the solvent from the 

suspension.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a method for making a material 
comprised of a superabsorbent polymer immobilized in a matrix 
material. This method utilizies a homogenizer. In U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/805,538 filed 
December 11, 1991 and which is incorporated herein by reference, 
there is described a new material comprising a combination of a 
superabsorbent polymer (SAP) and a matrix material. The material 
has good absorbent and retention properties and immobilizies the 
SAP. The described process requires that a suspension of SAP and 
matrix material be cooled prior to formation of the final 
product. The process, however, involves the use of an energy 
intensive step, the cooling step. Accordingly, further work has 
been done on the manufacturing process for this material. That 
work has been directed to the elimination of this costly cooling 
step.  A method for the manufacture of an absorbent material 
containing a superabsorbent polymer is disclosed herein. The 
processing steps include: providing a matrix material in a 
suitable solvent; mixing particles of a superabsorbent polymer 
into said solutioned matrix material to form a suspension; 
homogenizing the suspension; and removing the solvent from the 
suspension. The terms "superabsorbent polymer" or "SAP", as used herein, 
refer to any conventional superabsorbent polymer, as that term is 
commonly applied in the art. Examples of such SAPs are polymers 
of water soluble acrylic or vinyl monomers that are cross-linked 
with a polyfunctional reactant. Also included are starch 
modified polyacrylic acids and hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile and 
their alkali metal salts. A more through recitation of SAPs is 
presented in U.S. Patent No. 4,990,541, which is incorporated 
herein by reference. A number of such SAPs are commercially available and these 
are also suitable for use in the present invention. A preferred 
superabsorbent polymer is commercially available under the 
tradename SANWET®, a starched modified superabsorbent polymer,  
 
from Hoechst Celanese Corporation, Charlotte, NC. Sanwet® is a 
starched grafted polyacrylate sodium salt that has the capacity 
to absorb as much as 800 times its own weight in liquid. Other 
commercially available SAPs include: DRYTECH® 520 SUPERABSORBENT 
POLYMER available from Dow Chemical Company, Midland MI (Drytech® 
is a superabsorbent derived from polypropenoic acid); AQUA KEEP 
manufactured by Seitetsu Kagaku Co., Ltd.; ARASORB manufactured 
by Arakawa Chemical (U.S.A.) Inc.; ARIDALL 1125
