<ABSTRACT>
A method for use by a switching system in controlling the downloading 
of parameters to customer stations. The notification of stations due to a change in a 

configuration group is performed at a controlled rate and accordingly any reduction 
in call processing due to the parameter downloading of customer stations is limited. 

The controlled rate notification is performed in accordance with two lists that are 
maintained by the switching system and used to track the active/inactive status of 

customer stations and to order the notification of active stations and the status 
checking of inactive stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telecommunications.As stored program-controlled switching systems have evolved, a wide
variety of useful features have been developed to extend the communication
capabilities such systems provide. This development is expanded with the
deployment of integrated service digital network (ISDN) switching systems which
provide a separate, out-of-band signaling channel (the D-channel) between the
switching system and ISDN customer stations.When a customer orders ISDN service, the customer conveys to a
telephone company representative the specific services desired, including bearer
capabilities, supplementary services, etc. A significant part of this information is
related to the assignment of the services, directory numbers, and call appearances to
specific locations, e.g., buttons and lamps, on the ISDN stations. The customer may
make these determinations by consulting a template and then verbally
communicating which button is to activate each service and which lamp should be
associated with each service. All of this information is then stored in the switching
system database. In the past, it has been necessary to also manually enter into each
customer station some of the information verbally provided to the representative.
For the service to work properly, the station related information in the switching
system must exactly match the information entered into the station.To improve this process, a procedure known as ISDN parameter
downloading has been proposed where the D-channel is used for downloading such
station related information. With parameter downloading in place, the customer
would communicate the desired service information to the telephone company
representative as before. However, the customer stations would automatically
request parameter downloading as part of their initialization procedure so that no
additional manual steps would be required at the stations. When service profile
changes occur in the switching system that require parameters to be downloaded
again, the switching system notifies the customer stations to request a parameter
download. Parameter downloading eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone
manual steps at the customer stations. A configuration group is a group of customer stations that are all
identically configured, i.e., the buttons and lights are used in the same way for the
same feature set. Corporate customers may each have one or more configuration
groups that comprise hundreds or thousands of customer stations. The parameters
