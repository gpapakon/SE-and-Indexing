<ABSTRACT>
A self-limiting dispersion of a conductive material in a binder is disclosed wherein the conductive material consists essentially of a carbon material having a structure selected to undergo percolation when dispersed in the binder at a concentration of from about 10 weight percent to about 45 weight percent. The binder comprises a thermoplastic material selected to go through a first order phase transition or a second order transition at a temperature from about 200  DEG F to about 480  DEG F and the dispersion is formulated near the conductance percolation threshold so that its electrical conductivity drops precipitously ((e.g., at least about 1.5 to about 2 orders of magnitude) above the binder transition temperature. The dispersion of the conductive material in the binder is especially suitable for use as a self-limiting microwave heater material which is either a molding composition, surface coating composition, and especially a composition that can be applied to a substrate by printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is subject to a wide range of 
applications, but is especially suited for use in connection with 
self-limiting microwave heaters. The present application 
describes compositions and processes for manufacturing such 
heaters. The present invention will be particularly described in 
that connections The cooking of food and heating of substances with microwave 
radiation has become increasingly popular and important in recent 
years because of its speed, economy, and low power consomption. 
With food products, however, microwave heating has drawbacks. 
One of the major drawbacks is the inability to brown or sear the 
food product to make it similar in taste and appearance to 
conventionally cooked food. Several methods have been attempted in the prior art to 
overcome the browning problem. One such method for browning food 
and other materials involves the use of a metallized coating on 
paperboard. The prior art process for manufacturing this coated 
paperboard required several steps. 
First, metal particles are vacuum deposited onto a film, 
preferably an oriented polyester film. The film is then 
laminated onto the paper. The metallized film/paper laminate, 
typically, must be positioned onto a particular part of the food 
package, requiring a relatively complicated windowing operation. 
The windowing operation requires that the metallized laminate be 
slit before entering the process. The windowing process also can 
only create rectangular shaped laminates. 
Besides the complexity of the prior art process, there are 
several other disadvantages. With vacuum deposition, it is 
difficult, if not impractical, to develop a specific pattern or 
shape to the coating applied which would be useful for  
 
controlling the heating of the food product. It is also 
difficult to vary the coating formulation or coating thickness in 
localized areas of the film to meet different heating 
requirements. This is particularly important when heating 
different foods together in a microwave oven. In many microwave applications, an additional heating 
response is needed to crisp the surface of the food, e.a., pizza 
crust, waffles, french fries and the like, or a faster heat-up 
rate and higher temperature are needed for acceptable product 
quality, such as for popcorn. While the additional heat input is 
essentiel for these applications, at the same time it is 
desirable that this microwave interactive material or "susceptor" 
should possess the ability to Illimit" its upper temperature 
range to
