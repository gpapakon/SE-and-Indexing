<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for heat exchange between a coolant fluid (1) undergoing vaporisation and a fluid (2) to be cooled which is undergoing freezing. According to the invention, the device comprises a duct (3) for the fluid to be cooled, a casing (7) which forms, around the duct (3), an enclosure (8) for passage of the coolant fluid, and a mechanical means (11) for separating the wall (6) of the duct (3) from any solid phase in the fluid to be cooled, which mechanical means (11) consists of a rotor (12) provided with flexible radial filaments (14). The invention applies in particular to obtaining homogeneous mixtures of water and of ice.

Device for heat exchange between, on the one 
hand, a refrigerant (1), for example in the course of 

vaporization, and, on the other hand, a fluid (2) to be 
cooled, in the course of partial freezing, the said 

device comprising: 

at least one conduit (3) for pressurized circulation 
of the fluid (2) to be cooled, from an inlet (4, 22) 

to an opposed outlet (5) for the said fluid, 
comprising a heat exchange wall (6), one of the 

faces of which, called the warm face (6a), is in 
contact with the fluid (2) to be cooled; 
a means (8) for passing the refrigerant, in contact 
with the other face, called the cold face (6b), of 

the heat exchange wall (6), 
a mechanical means (11) resisting deposition, on the 
warm face (6a) of the
 heat exchange wall (6), of any 
solid layer of the fluid to be cooled, which 

includes a rotor (12) mounted within the conduit 
(3), elements resisting the said deposition, each in 

contact with or in the vicinity of the warm face 
(6a) of the heat exchange wall (6), these being 

distributed along the axis of and around the rotor 
(12), as well as a means (40) for driving the 

latter, 
 
characterized in that the said resisting elements (13) 

comprise a multiplicity of flexible filaments (14), one 
end of which is fastened to the rotor (12), the other, 

free end of which is adjacent to the warm face (6a) of 
the heat exchange wall (6), and arranged in connection 

with the rotation of the rotor, essentially in order to 
agitate, in liquid phase, the boundary layer of the 

stream of the fluid (2) to be cooled, in contact with the 
warm face (6a) of the heat exchange wall (6). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the circulation conduit (3) constitutes the heat 

exchange wall (6), a shell (7) makes, with and around the 
conduit (3), a chamber (8) for passage of the refrigerant, 

especially with counterflow of the fluid to be  
 

cooled, and the flexible filaments (14) exhibit individually 
at least one radial extension. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the filaments (14) are separated from each other, 

forming a plurality of filamentary members (15). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, from one end of the circulation conduit (3) to the 

other, the filamentary members (15) are superimposed in 
groups of two, being angularly offset with respect to the 

axis of the rotor, from one group to the other. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that, for each group, the two filamentary members (15) 

are arranged in the same diametral plane. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that a group of filamentary members (15) is angularly 

offset by 90° or 60° with respect to the next one. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the filaments (14) together constitute a continuous 

or discontinuous helix (16) about the axis of the rotor 
(12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it includes means (18) for driving the rotor (12), 

acting under the motory effect of the fluid (2) to be 
cooled passing through the circulation conduit (3). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that it comprises a plurality of conduits (3) for 

circulation of the fluid to be cooled, these being 
arranged in parallel, and a common shell (7) making, with 

the said conduits, one and the same chamber (8) for 
passage of the refrigerant, a distributor (29) for 

distributing the fluid to be cooled into the various 
circulation conduits (3), and a manifold (30) for the 

cooled fluid discharged from the various circulation 
conduits. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, firstly, a plurality of volumes (41) for passage of 

the refrigerant are arranged in parallel, coaxial with 
the axis of the rotor (12) and in a staged manner in the 

conduit (3) for circulation of the fluid to be cooled,

partition (42, 43) forming an element of the heat 

exchange wall (6), secondly, a distributor (44) for the 
refrigerant, in connection with the inlet (9) for the 

said fluid, and a manifold (45) for the said refrigerant, 
in connection with the outlet (10) for the said fluid, 

these being arranged especially on the outside of the 
circulation conduit (3), communicate with the plurality
