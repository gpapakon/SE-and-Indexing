said pressure means (5) are fixed at their other
end directly to a first member (6) of said rail or road

vehicle,
said holding means (7) are fixed to said frame
(2) and cooperate with a second member (8) of the rail or

road vehicle, and
said frame (2) is fastened to said rail or road
vehicle by the combined action of said holding means (7)

and said pressure means (5), to the exclusion of any
other means, the combined action of the pressure means

(5) and the holding means (7) creating sufficient
adhesion between said drive means and the ground.
A system according to claim 1 wherein the drive
means (1) fixed to the frame (2) consist of at least one

driving wheel keyed to the end of an axle (9) and are
held so that they are free to rotate by a first set of

bearings (10) fastened to the frame (2) rotatably holding

the axle (9), and a first toothed wheel (11) is fastened
to the axle (9) and is associated with a second toothed

wheel (12) driven in rotation by said rotation drive
means (4).
A system according to either claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the rotation drive means (4) consist of a

pneumatic motor fixed to the frame (2) and equipped with
a brake which is active when there is no pressure, said

rotation drive means (4) drive rotation of said second
toothed wheel (12) via a toothed clutch system (13)

operated pneumatically and a gearbox (14) with
cylindrical gears, said second toothed wheel (12) is

rotatably held by a second set of bearings (10) fastened
to the frame (2) and said gearbox (14) with cylindrical

gears is coupled to the pneumatic motor by a flexible
coupling (15).
A system according to any of claims 1 to 3
wherein the pressure means (5) consist of a pneumatic

actuator pivotably fixed at one end to the frame (2) and
at the other end to the first member (6) of the rail or

road vehicle and said actuator co-operates with the first
member (6) of the rail or road vehicle so as to apply to

it a force directed so that the resultant force applied
to the ground by the driving wheels is at best

perpendicular to the plane defined by the ground.
A system according to any of claims 1 to 4
wherein the end of the actuator fixed to the frame is

fastened to said frame at different longitudinal
positions by means of a multiposition support (20)

disposed longitudinally so that it is able to adapt to
the different positions of the first member (6) of the

rail or road vehicle to define a satisfactory resultant
force applied to the ground by the driving wheels.
A system according to any of claims 1 to 5
wherein the holding means (7) fixed to the frame (2) and

cooperating with a second member (8) of the rail or road
vehicle consists of at least one holding hook fixed to

the end of the frame.
A system according to any of claims 1 to 6
wherein the guide means (16) consist of two retractable 

wheels.
A method of using a system according to any of
claims 1 to 7, characterised by:


manually placing the propulsion and manoeuvring
system by means of a telescopic rod (18) and a pivoting

wheel (19) fastened to the frame, with the propulsion and
manoeuvring system in a disengaged configuration, in

order to place it near the vehicle to be moved;
attaching the propulsion and manoeuvring system
to said vehicle by tilting said system towards the front
