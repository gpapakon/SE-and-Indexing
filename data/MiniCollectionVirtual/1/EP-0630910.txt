<ABSTRACT>
Lewis Bases are used to control the activity of an olefin 
polymerization reaction and, if need be, to substantially terminate 

the entire reaction completely. Such activity reduction or 
termination of the reaction by the one or more Lewis Bases can be 

completely reversed by the simple introduction of additional co-catalyst. 
The use of such Lewis Bases to control static is also 

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally pertains to the field of olefin 
polymerization reactions, including gas or liquid phase reactions. 
More particularly, the present invention is directed to the use of 
Lewis Bases to terminate the reaction, especially in an emergency 
situation. Significantly, such activity termination by the one or more 
Lewis Bases can be reversed by the simple introduction of additional 
co-catalyst. The use of such Lewis Bases to control electrostatic 
charge is also disclosed. In olefin polymerization processes which are exothermic, there 
is a need to be able to terminate the reaction rapidly and effectively 
in an emergency situation, while providing the ability to effectively 
and economically restart the reaction without difficulty. It is known that the polymerization of monoolefins, 
particularly alpha-olefins, such as propylene, in slurry or bulk 
polymerizations using the well known Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems 
can be terminated by the addition of substances such as alcohols, 
ketones, ethers, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, phenols, water, oxygen 
and carbon oxides. It is also known that the polymerization of 
olefins, such as ethylene or propylene in gas phase processes also 
using such Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems, can be terminated by the 
addition of carbon oxides. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,326,048. It is also known that the polymerization of olefins, such as 
ethylene or propylene in gas phase processes also using such Ziegler-Natta 
catalyst systems can be controlled by the addition of activity 
retarders. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,066,736. In U.S. Patent No. 4,326,048, carbon oxides are used to 
terminate a gas phase alpha-olefin polymerization reaction that 
utilizes a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system comprised of a titanium  
 
halide and an aluminum alkyl. While such termination of the 
reaction is reversible, it is not efficient or economical. The 
termination cannot be reversed by the simple addition of more 
aluminum alkyl. In order to restart the reaction, the carbon oxides 
must be removed by venting and flushing the entire reactor system. 
It is expensive and difficult to remove the carbon oxides from the non-polymerized 
monomer because the volatility of the carbon oxide is 
similar to the volatility of the typical monomer used. Undesirably, 
therefore, the unreacted monomer is typically removed with the 
carbon oxides. This results in a loss of valuable product by the loss of 
such precursor monomer and, still further, results in considerable 
d
