<ABSTRACT>
A circuit designing system improves precision 
of fan out checking and further improves reasonableness 

of construction and consistency of derivation of a 
wiring capacity. Therefore, wiring lengths of 

respective wiring connected to respective output 
terminals of the circuit element of an objective 

circuit to be designed is predicted on the basis of a 
circuit design information and the wiring capacity is 

derived on the basis of the predicted wiring length. 
In the alternative, the wiring capacity is derived on 

the basis of the wiring length of respective wiring 
determined as a result of layout designing. The wiring 

capacity thus derived is used only for fan out 
checking, but also for logic synthesizing and logic 

simulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit
designing system for performing circuit designing, such
as for LSI and so forth, on a computer system. More
specifically, the invention relates to a circuit
designing system which has a design rule checking
function for checking whether a result of circuit
designing of a semiconductor integrated circuit
conforms a design rule or not.Conventionally, in a circuit designing system
of the type set forth above, in order to check whether
the contents of a circuit diagram data or circuit
connection information prepared at a predetermined step
(circuit designing step) (hereinafter, these
information, i.e. circuit diagram data or circuit
connection information, will be referred to as "circuit
design information: NETLIST") is prepared according to
a preliminarily established design rule or not, a
design rule checking device is normally provided.A design rule checking is performed at a step
immediately after preparation of the circuit design
information by a circuit diagram editor or logic
synthesizing tool and so forth. By performing design 
rule checking at early stage of designing, a quality of
circuit design can be remarkably improved. Also, error
or defect of the circuit which tends to be found in the
later stage of designing operation (e.g. logic
simulation or layout designing and so forth) can be
found at earlier timing so as to contribute for
shortening of LSI development period.A process of LSI designing by the
conventional design system will be discussed briefly.At first, the circuit design information
including circuit construction information and circuit
connection information is prepared by a circuit diagram
editor and a logic synthesizing tool and so forth.
The content of the prepared circuit design information
is checked against a predetermined design rule. If the
result of checking shows that no error is found, then,
a logic simulation is performed according to the
circuit design information. Subsequently, check is
performed whether a simulation error is present or not.
When layout error, design rule error or simulation and
error is caused, the process is returned to a step for
information generating the circuit design information.
Accordingly, occurrence of error at later stage (for
example, layout design than circuit design information
preparation) should cause wasting of done steps to
cause longer design period.Amongst, the design ruler checking is 
particularly important for development of ASIC
(Application Specific IC), for which general user is
direct
