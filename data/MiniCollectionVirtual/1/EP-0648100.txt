<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disposable absorbent
articles such as female sanitary napkins, adult
incontinence devices, and the like. Still more particularly,
the present invention concerns such disposable
absorbent articles having side flaps.All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured
for the absorption of body fluids such as menses,
urine, and feces are, of course, well known. Absorbent
articles, particularly sanitary napkins, having wings or
flaps are disclosed in the literature and are available in
the marketplace.Generally, the flaps extend laterally from a central
absorbent means and are intended to be folded around
the edges of the wearer's panties in the crotch region.
Thus, the flaps are disposed between the edges of the
wearer's panties in the crotch region and the wearer's
thighs. Commonly, the flaps are provided with an attachment
means for affixing the flaps to the underside of the
wearer's panties.The flaps serve at least two purposes. First, the
flaps prevent exudates which otherwise would soil the
edges of the wearer's panties from doing such. Second,
the flaps help stabilize the napkin from shifting out of
place, especially when the flaps are affixed to the
underside of the panties.
Sanitary napkins having flaps of the various types are
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,687,478, entitled "Shaped
Sanitary Napkin With Flaps", which issued to Van
Tilburg on August 18,1987, U.S. Patent 4,608,047, entitled
"Sanitary Napkin Attachment Means", which issued
to Mattingly on August 26, 1986, U.S. Patent 4,589,876,
entitled "Sanitary Napkin", which issued to Van Tilburg
on May 20,1986, U.S. Patent 4,285,343, entitled "Sanitary
Napkin", which issued to McNair on August 25,
1981, U.S. Patent 3,397,697, entitled "Disposable Sanitary
Shield For Undergarments", which issued to Rickard
on August 20, 1968, and U.S. Patent 2,787,271,
entitled "Sanitary Napkin", which issued to Clark on
April 2, 1957.While flaps greatly improve the effectiveness of a
sanitary napkin, the flaps of a sanitary napkin may
hinder or impede application of the sanitary napkin to
the crotch of the wearer's panty. Currently, each of the
flaps of a sanitary napkin have an end, the distal end,
which may move freely relative to the sanitary napkin.
Once the release paper of the central pad adhesive is
removed by the wearer, the distal ends of the flaps may
fall between the crotch portion of the wearer's panty and
the sanitary napkin and may become adhered to the
central pad adhesive. Therefore, there is a need for a
sanitary
