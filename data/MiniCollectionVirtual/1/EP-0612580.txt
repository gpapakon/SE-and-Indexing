<ABSTRACT>
A process for welding stainless steel tubing in 
the presence of an inert gas comprising a silicon base 

gas, in particular silane SiH₄. During the welding operation, 

a suitable quantity of silicon is deposited by 
chemical vapor deposition at the weld joint to significantly 

improve the corrosion resistance of the weld.

<DESCRIPTION>
Although surface treated stainless steel is quite 
corrosion resistant, areas in which stainless steel have 
been joined by welding are comparatively highly corrosion 
sensitive due to the destruction of surface passivation 
layers and possible metallurgical phase transformations in 
the heat affected zones. The present invention is 
intended to significantly improve corrosion resistance. It is reasonably well known that welding significantly 
reduces the corrosion resistance of stainless 
steels. For example, in the text entitled "Corrosion and 
Corrosion Control - an Introduction to Corrosion Science 
and Engineering" Third Ed., H.H. Uhlig, et al., it is 
taught that when austenitic stainless steels have been 
welded and then subjected to corrosive environments, 
failure of the austenitic stainless steel weld (called 
weld decay) occurs in a zone slightly away from the weld 
rather than at the weld itself. It is taught that, under 
certain conditions, rapid quenching from high temperatures 
can aid in improving corrosion resistance. The use of silicon as a protective coating is 
fairly well known. For example, in an article appearing 
in the Journal of Material Science, Vol. 26, at pp. 9445-52 
(1991) entitled "Chemical Vapor Deposition of Silicon 
Onto Iron: Influence of Silicon Vapor Phase Source on the 
Composition and Nature of the Coating", it was taught that 
Armco iron could be treated with a gas mixture of argon, 
silane and hydrogen. It was taught that this gas mixture, 
when applied at a range of 750° to 1100°C., provided a 
non-porous and adherent solid solution with a maximum 
silicon content of 6% (by weight). It was hypothesized 
that such a mixture lead to the nucleation of Fe3Si, the 
growth of which occurred from and around the open porosity 
of the coating.  
 It is known that stainless steel, and particularly 
316 L stainless steel, is exceedingly corrosion resistant. 
In fact, tubing made of 316 L stainless is the conduit of 
choice in microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing 
facilities where such tubing is required for the delivery 
of corrosive gases. The stainless steel tubing is made 
even more corrosion resistant by conducting various well 
known surface treating operations such as 
electropolishing, oxygen passivating and bright annealing. 
Electropolished tubing is currently the preferred conduit 
in terms of impurity absorption and corrosion resistance. It is also known from EP-A-512782 a method of 
surface passivating stainless steel by flushing the 
surface of
