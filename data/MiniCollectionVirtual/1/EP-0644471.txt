<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical control
method and a numerical control system used for the control
of various types of PTP (point to point) operations such as
robot control, temperature control, camera focus control,
slide control of a CD player, video disk, and the like, and
DC point control of electrical circuits. More particularly,
it relates to a numerical control method and numerical
control system which enable free setting of a pattern of
acceleration and deceleration free from the amount of
movement or the time of movement.In general, in a servo control circuit, there is known
a method for converting information on the phase and speed
of a controlled object to a pattern, storing the same in
advance in a memory, and later reading out the information
in accordance with a target point to control the object at
different points of time. In this case, the acceleration
curve and deceleration curve are tinkered with so that the
controlled object will be operated smoothly and within the
desired time.For example, the most general pattern of acceleration
and deceleration is the triangular pattern shown in Fig.
1A, but since the acceleration jumps at three locations:
the starting point of movement, the peak point, and the
target point, it suffers from the disadvantage that a shock
is easily given to the mechanical system. Further, this
cannot be said to be optimal as the input to a servo
control circuit.Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1B, proposal has been made
of a pattern of acceleration and deceleration which
provides a constant speed portion F as a stopping measure
immediately before the target point, but even with this 
pattern of acceleration and deceleration, the jumps in acceleration at the starting point of
movement and the peak point in the transition from acceleration to deceleration are not
eliminated, so it also suffers from the disadvantage of the shock to the mechanical system
cannot be completely resolved. Further, the disadvantage that the input is not the
optimal one for a servo control system similarly remains.On the other hand, to achieve a smooth operation at the time of acceleration and
deceleration, the method has been proposed of storing in advance in a read-only-memory
(ROM) the smooth pattern of acceleration and deceleration as shown in Fig.
2A. By this technique, problems in overshooting and precision of stopping are
remarkably eliminated. However, the acceleration and deceleration times are made
constant, so if the amount of movement is increased, the acceleration and
