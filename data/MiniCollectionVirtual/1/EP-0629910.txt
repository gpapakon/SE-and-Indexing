<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material and a super high contrast
negative image-forming process using the material, specifically
to a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material used
for a photomechanical process.In a field of a graphic art, a forming system for an
image having a super high contrast photographic characteristic
(particularly, gamma is 10 or more) is needed in order to
improve reproducibility of an image with a continuous gradation
by a halftone dot image and reproducibility of a line image.There is known as a method in which a stable developing
solution is used to obtain a high contrast photographic
characteristic, the methods using hydrazine derivatives
described in U.S. Patents 4,224,401, 4,168,977, 4,166,742,
4,311,781, 4,272,606, 4,211,857, 4,912,016, and 4,998,604, and
JP-A-3-259240 (corresponding to U.S. Patent 5,221,593) (the
term "JP-A" as used herein means an unexamined Japanese patent
application) and JP-A-5-45761 (corresponding to U.S. Patent
5,279,919). A super high contrast and high sensitive
photographic characteristic can be obtained according to these
methods, and furthermore, since it is allowed to add sulfite in 
a high concentration to a developing solution, stability of the
developing solution to air oxidation is remarkably improved as
compared with that of a lithographic developing solution.However, it has found that conventional hydrazine
compounds have several defects. That is, it was tried to
provide the structures of the conventional hydrazine compounds
with an anti-diffusible property for the purpose of decreasing
an adverse influence to the other photographic materials by
flowing into a development processing solution. Since these
anti-diffusible hydrazine compounds are necessary to be used in
a large amount for a sensitization and to increase contrast, a
physical strength of a light-sensitive layer obtained is
deteriorated and the hydrazine compounds are deposited in a
coating solution of the light-sensitive layer. Furthermore,
there has been found a problem that processing in a fatigued
developing solution in which a lot of the light-sensitive
materials are processed can not provide a sufficiently high
contrast.In general, a contact work light-sensitive material
handled in a daylight occupies a large area as one of the
light-sensitive materials for a photomechanical processing, and
in this field, a high superimposed letter image quality by
which even a fine Ming letter is reproduced. That has required
