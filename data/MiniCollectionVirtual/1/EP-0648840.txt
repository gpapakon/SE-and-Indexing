<ABSTRACT>
DNA regulatory elements that control cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression are 
disclosed, including bile acid responsive elements. A gene construct comprising at 

least one CYP7 regulatory element and a reporter gene is used to transfect HepG2 
cells. Confluent transfected HepG2 cells are employed in an assay to detect a 

compound that modulates cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme regulation. A method 
for screening compounds that inhibit or stimulate expression of the enzyme is 

provided, as well as a method for detecting and isolating transcription factors of 
the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene. A transcription factor of 57 KDa is identified 

which is useful in an assay for determining regulation of CYP7 expression.

<DESCRIPTION>
High serum cholesterol is commonly associated with an increased risk of heart 
attack, atherosclerosis and circulatory disorders. In addition, a variety of diseases 
are caused by disorder of cholesterol catabolism, such as gallstone disease, 
atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia and some lipid storage diseases. The major pathway for disposal of cholesterol in the body is by secretion of 
cholesterol and bile acids into the gut. Bile contains free cholesterol and bile acids. 
The enzyme, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7) commits cholesterol to bile acid 
synthesis and catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis in the 
liver. Thus, by increasing synthesis of bile acids, this enzyme plays a key role in 
the liver by depleting hepatic cholesterol pools, resulting in increased LDL uptake 
and a lowering of serum cholesterol levels. Bile acids are physiological agents which are important in the solubilization of lipid-soluble 
vitamin, sterol and xenobiotics. Bile acids are synthesized exclusively in the 
liver and are secreted to the intestines where they are modified to secondary bile 
acids. Most bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and recirculated to the 
hepatocytes via the portal vein. The feedback of bile into the liver is known to inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 
and thus inhibit the overall rate of bile acid synthesis. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 
therefore has been a subject of intense studies to elucidate the regulatory 
mechanisms of bile acid synthesis in the liver.  It is known that an interruption of bile acid reabsorption, such as caused by the 
bile sequestrant, cholestyramine, or by a bile fistula, stimulates the rate of bile acid 
synthesis and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver. It is believed that 
cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver is regulated primarily at the gene 
transcriptional level by bile acids, cholesterol, hormones, diurnal rhythm and other 
factors. Generally, the regulation of eukaryotic genes is thought to occur at several 
locations, including the promoter sequences, located upstream of the transcription 
start site; enhancer or repressor sequences, located upstream of the promoter; 
within intron sequences, non-coding sequences located between exons or coding 
sequence; and in 3' sequences, located downstream from the coding region. The 
promoter sequence is unique to each gene and is required for the accurate and 
efficient initiation of gene transcription. Enhancers and/or repressors regulate 
promoter activity and
