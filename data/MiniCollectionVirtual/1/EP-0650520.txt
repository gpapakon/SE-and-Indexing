<ABSTRACT>
Nucleotide sugars, especially UDP, ADP, CDP or TDP saccharoses can be enzymatically obtained by the reaction of nucleoside diphosphates with di or trisaccharides with a saccharose synthase in which the virtual absence of nucleoside phosphatases (0.1 % or less) can be ensured by special purification methods and sensitive detection. The purification of the raw extract, obtained preferably from rice grains, comprises especially the application of the ultra-filtered extract containing 50 mM KCl with a pH 8 on a sepharose Q column and a gradient elution out of the column at a pH 8 with 50 to 500 mM KCl.

Process for production of saccharose synthase

characterised in that
 a saccharose synthase-containing
crude extract is subjected to a sequence of purification

steps which includes the application of an ultrafiltered
extract of pH 8 containing 50 mM KCl onto a sepharose Q

column and a gradient elution from the column at pH 8 with
50-500 mM KCl.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

a crude extract from swelled and mechanically disintegrated
rice grains is subjected to the following purification

steps:

precipitation of accompanying proteins with PEG or
aqueous 2-phase separation;
application of the supernatant adjusted to pH 8 or of the
correspondingly adjusted phase containing the enzyme

activity onto a sepharose Q column;
gradient elution at pH 8 with 50-500 mM KCl; and
gel filtration column chromatography.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the saccharose synthase thus obtained is used for the
reaction of nucleoside diphosphates with di, tri or oligosaccharides

or derivatives thereof with the formation of
nucleotide-sugars or -sugar derivatives.
Process according to Claim 3, wherein UDP, ADP, TDP
or CDP are provided as nucleoside diphosphate and

saccharose as disaccharide.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

saccharose synthase together with epimerases (a) and/or
transferases (b) is used for the formation of an activated

sugar or sugar derivative and

(a) modification of its sugar portion; or
(b) transfer of the sugar portion onto other acceptor
molecules.
Process according to Claim 5(b), 
characterised in
that
 a sugar is provided as acceptor.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the saccharose synthase thus obtained is used for the
reaction of activated glucose or derivatives thereof with a

hydroxyl group-containing acceptor in particular a sugar
for the formation of glucosides or derivatives.
