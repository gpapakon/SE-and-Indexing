<ABSTRACT>
A flexible walled container having a body portion (1) with wall 
portions (2), a bottom portion (3) which is substantially flat, enabling 

the container to stand upright, a top portion (4) with a neck to which 
sealable closure means such as a closure cap may be attached, and a 

single fold line (8) consisting of an indentation of a surface of a wall 
portion which transversely crosses the container, enabling the base of 

the container to be folded upwards and the body portion generally 
flattened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic bottles, in particular 
to a way of making plastic bottles more easily disposable 
and environmentally-friendly. It is already known to incorporate into plastics bottles 
fold lines, to make them more readily collapsible and 
therefore easier to dispose of. For example, in Canadian 
patent 2,021,398 (Duering), there are described 
collapsible bottles which are essentially square or 
rectangular in cross section, and contain a plurality of 
fold lines to aid the collapsibility of the bottle. In addition, there is commercially available from 
Supermatic Kunststoff AG a collapsible bottle, which again 
is essentially rectangular in cross section, and has fold 
lines on it positioned so as to aid its collapsibility, 
such that it may be collapsed to as little as 8% of its 
original volume. This is of use both for ease of 
transportation of the empty bottle prior to filling and 
use, and also for ease of disposal after use. The fold 
lines on the Supermatic bottle design which aid 
collapsibility include two vertical fold lines in the 
middle of the sides of the bottle, and two sets of fold  
 
lines on all sides of the bottle (i.e. on the back, front 
and sides of the bottle), both at the top and the bottom, 
to allow the essentially rectangular top and bottom faces 
of the bottle to collapse on to either the front or the 
back panels of the bottle. EP-A-521417 (JOH.A. BENCKISER GmbH) discloses a flexible container 
according to the preamble of claim 1. A problem associated with these known bottle designs is 
the number of fold lines that are to be found in the 
bottle design to enable it to adequately collapse. The 
bottle design of the Duering patent requires that the 
bottle should have at least two long, vertical fold lines 
of the sides of the bottle, whilst the Supermatic bottle 
design has two long vertical fold lines along the sides of 
the bottle, and two horizontal fold lines which run around 
the whole of the bottle body. This leads to problems in 
that the bottle design may be undesirably weakened by the 
number of fold lines required, and hence requires the 
bottle to be made of a more rigid plastic than would 
otherwise be necessary. We have surprisingly discovered that it is possible to 
produce a collapsible but sturdy bottle design with only 
one horizontal fold line on the bottle, and yet provide a 
bottle with good collapsibility properties and which is 
convenient to manufacture, and has good performance in 
use. Because it has only one fold line, the

<CLAIMS>
A flexible container having: 

a body portion (1) with a front wall portion and a 
back wall portion (2); 
a bottom portion (3) which is substantially flat, 
enabling the container to stand upright; 
a top portion (4) with a neck (6) to which sealable 
closure means may be attached and a fold line (8) on the front wall 

portion or the back wall portion which transversely crosses the container substantially parallel 
to said bottom portion for collapsing the container characterised in that the 

container has a substantially oval cross-section and a single fold line (8) consisting 
of an indentation of a surface of said wall portion, 

enabling the base 
of the container to be folded upwards and the body 

portion flattened. 
A container according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the single fold line (8) is located between 

recess fold lines (9). 
A container according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the fold line (8) is positioned 

on the container at a distance from the bottom portion 
(3) of half of the maximum width of the bottom portion 

(3). 
A container according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the single fold line (8) is 

located within 2cm of the bottom portion.  
 
A container according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it is manufactured from blow-moulded 

plastics materials.
