Pneumatic brake-booster for a vehicle comprising 
an engine compartment and a passenger space which are 

separated by an apron (76), the booster comprising a 
casing (10) formed of a front shell (10a) and of a back 

shell (10b) and inside which is located a piston (20) 
formed of a back tubular part (22) supporting a skirt 

(14) which, with the aid of an unrolling membrane (12), 
defines a first chamber (16), or front chamber, connected 

permanently to a source of partial vacuum and a second 
chamber (18), or back chamber, connected selectively to 

the front chamber (16) or to the atmosphere by a valve 
means (40) actuated by a control rod (34), the casing 

(10) of the booster comprising means (74) for securing 
the booster to the apron (76) of the vehicle, 

characterized in that, it comprises a third chamber (65, 
204) connected permanently to the atmosphere through a 

filter element (68, 212) and selectively to the second 
chamber (18) by the valve means (40), this third chamber 

(65, 204) having a volume at least equal to the minimal 
volume of the second chamber (18). 
Booster according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the volume of the third chamber (65, 204) is 

partially delimited by a bellows (60, 160) secured in 

leaktight manner to the control rod (34). 
Booster according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the third chamber (65) is formed between the back 

shell (10b) of the booster and the apron (76) of the 
vehicle. 
Booster according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the volume of the third chamber (65) is also 

delimited by the back face of the back shell (10b) of the 
booster and by the front face of a housing (50) secured 

in leaktight manner to the casing (10) of the booster and 
onto which the bellows (60) is secured in leaktight 

manner.  
 
Booster according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the housing (50) comprises a cylindrical peripheral 

part (54) whose diameter is virtually equal to that of 
the casing (10) of the booster, and which is secured in 

leaktight manner to the casing (10) of the booster. 
Booster according to claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that the housing (50) comprises on its 

cylindrical peripheral part (54) an aperture (66) 
associated with the filter element (68). 
Booster according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the aperture (66) is directed, when the booster is 

secured to the apron (76) of the vehicle, downward. 
Booster according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the filter element (68) is disposed in the third 

chamber (65) in the immediate vicinity of the aperture 
(66). 
Booster according to claim 4, characterized in 
that an aperture (66, 66') is formed inside a tubular 

cylindrical extension (80, 80') of the housing (50), one 
end of a pipe (82, 82', 202) being connected to this 

tubular cylindrical extension (80, 80'), the other end of 
the pipe (82, 82', 202) being associated with the filter 

element (68, 212). 
Booster according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the aperture (66) is formed in the cylindrical 

peripheral part (54) of the housing (50). 
Booster according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the tubular cylindrical extension (80') passes in 

leaktight manner through an aperture (76') in the apron 
(76). 
Booster according to any of claims 2 through 11, 
characterized in that the bellows possess an end part 

(62) secured in leaktight manner onto the control rod 
(34) via an intermediate part (64) having, in the third 

chamber (65), a concave shape. 
Booster according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the means (74) for securing the 

booster to the apron of the vehicle pass in leaktight  
 

manner through the third chamber (65). 
Booster according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the bellows (160) are also secured in leaktight 

manner onto a cylindrical extension (26) directed towards 
the back of the back shell (10b) of the booster and is 

formed with a tubular extension (200) connected by piping 
(202) to the third chamber (65, 204). 
Booster according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the third chamber (65) is formed 

with two apertures (66, 66'), and in that a forced 
circulation of air is established between these two 

apertures (66, 66').
