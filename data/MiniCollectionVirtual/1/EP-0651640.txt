<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF 7-FLU0R0-1 -METHYL-3-METHYLSULPHINYL-4-QUIN0L0NE IN THE TREATMENT OF ANGINA PECTORISThe present invention relates to a method for the treatment of angina pectoris in humans .Angina pectoris arises from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Typically the condition results -from narrowing of the coronary arteries through atherosclerosis. This reduces blood flow, and thus oxygen supply, to the heart muscles, resulting in a severe cardiac oxygen deficiency which can cause severe pain to the sufferer. The condition can, in extreme form, be life-threatening. Attacks of angina pectoris are commonly brought on by exercise or by stress which increase oxygen demand in the cardiac muscles to a point where it cannot be met by the reduced supply of blood thereto.European Patent Publication No. 0149519A (The Boots Company PLC) discloses the use, in the treatment of heart failure, of quinolones of the following general formula (I) :wherein m is 0 or 1; n is 0, 1 or 2; and R is hydrogen, halo, methyl or trifluoromethyl.Preferred compounds for such use are stated to be inter alia 7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphiny1-4- quinolone and l-methyl-3-methylsulphonyl-methyl-4- guinolone. 

 British Patent Application No. 8400905, one of two priority documents submitted during prosecution of the above European Patent Application, and thereby laid open to public inspection, discloses quinolones of general formula IIwherein n is 0, 1 or 2; R-j_ is lower alkyl optionally substituted by hydroxy, -j__ alkoxycarbonyl or -]__^ alkoxy; allyl; propynyl or phenyl-lower alkyl in which the phenyl ring is optionally substituted by 1 or 2 C-j__4 alkoxy groups or 1 or 2 Cτ__4 alkyl groups; R2 is Cτ__4 alkyl, ~2 -*i alkenyl or ^ ^^ alkynyl with the proviso that, when n is 0, R2 is methyl; and R3, R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkanoyl, halo, trifluoro ethyl or lower alkylthio.It is stated in the specification that compounds of formula II are "useful in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease and/or heart failure" . It is also stated, later in the specification, that:"It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in some cases, the patient may have ischaemic heart disease or heart failure but that, in many cases, the patient has both disorders. It will also be appreciated that ischaemic heart disease includes angina and myocardial infarction."Members of the class of quinolones defined in general formula II are thus disclosed to be of use in the
