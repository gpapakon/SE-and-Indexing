<ABSTRACT>
A sleeve connection for a continuous cable is described, having a branch cable and a connecting element which is seated on a stripped section of the continuous cable and whose conductor is made contact with and to which the branch cable is connected. One or two clamps (1) which are arranged at the side of the connecting element on a sheathed section of the continuous cable fix the continuous cable and the branch cable in their mutually dependent positions. The continuous cable, connecting element, branch cable and clamp (1, 16) form a preassembled unit which is sheathed by sheathing (31) after construction and forms a shell for potting compound which is poured into the cavity in the sheathing. This results in the cable connection being capable of being fixed centrally and securely without sheathing and cured potting compound and, in addition, installation is simplified.
