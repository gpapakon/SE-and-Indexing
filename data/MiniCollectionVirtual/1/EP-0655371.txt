<ABSTRACT>
A pre-loader device that quickly tighten a seat belt 
after a sudden deceleration of a vehicle is detected is disclosed 

herein. The pre-loader device includes a mass body (2) and a 
casing (1) housing the mass body (2) with the mass body (2) being 

movable in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle within the 
casing (1). A holder (3) is positioned by a weak coil spring 

(9), and a strong coil spring (6) is disposed between a flange 
part (21) of the mass body (2
) and a flange part of the holder 
(31). A retainer and the holder (3) hold therebetween stoppers 

(5A,5B) disposed at the tip of plate springs (4A,4B) that extend 
from the rear end of the mass body (2) so as to position the mass 

body (2) and maintaining the coil spring (6) in a compressed 
state. A wire (10) connects the rear end of the mass body (2) 

to a seat belt buckle (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a belt 
tightener for a seat belt for use with passengers in moving 
vehicles, such as cars, trucks, roller coasters, etc. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a belt tightener 
for tightening a seat belt when the vehicle is subject to sudden 
deceleration. A pre-loader device 
according to the preamble of claim 1 
is designed to quickly tighten a 
seat belt to eliminate any slack therein and protect the 
passenger in conjunction with the locking of the retractor. To 
enable the seat belt to be tightened in a short time, 
conventional devices have been proposed that cause the seat belt  
 
buckle to move using spring force of a torsion bar or a coil 
spring. Such a tightening device is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 4-63746 
(corresponding to EP-A-0525837) 
and 61-241234. 
Another proposal for tightening a seat belt has been to reel a 
seat belt using the explosive power of powder, for example. Such 
a device is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent No. 
63-22752. Each of the above conventional seat belt buckles is 
provided with a locking mechanism for locking the tongue plate 
of the seat belt and a release button for releasing the locking 
operation of the locking mechanism in order to make the seat belt 
detachable. However, these systems have the problem that, after 
the seat belt buckle is pulled in by the pre-loader during a 
sudden stop of the vehicle, for example, as the seat buckle has 
been displaced, the release button can not be quickly operated 
when the passenger attempts to leave the vehicle. Such a problem 
poses problems in the event of motor vehicle accidents. It is desirable that the pre-loader device should be 
actuated to protect the passenger not only when the vehicle 
collides but also when the vehicle is running on a rough road, 
for example. However, conventional devices have been designed 
taking only collisions into consideration, and therefore, the 
whole device has to be replaced after the device is actuated a 
single time. It is desirable that a pre-loader device complete the 
tightening of the seat belt in a short time from when sudden 
deceleration of the vehicle is detected to when the body load of  
 
the passenger is applied to the seat belt. However, conventional 
pre-loader devices are not yet actuated in a sufficiently short 
enough time. It is thus an object of the present invention to solve 
the problem noted above by providing a seat belt buckle with 
which a

<CLAIMS>
A belt tightener for a seat belt, wherein said belt 
tightener pulls in a seat belt when deceleration of a 

moving vehicle exceeds a predetermined value, comprising: 

a casing (1) disposed in the vehicle; 
a compression spring (6) having a first end and a 
second end and disposed in said casing; 
a connecting member (22) having a first end and a 
second end, with a buckle (14) of the seat belt connected 

to said first end of said connecting member; 
a supporting member (3) supporting said first end of 
said compression spring; 
a pull-in member (2) contacting said second end of said 
compression spring (6), connected to said second end of 

said connecting member (22) and adapted to move in an 
expansion direction of said compression spring (6) 

following expansion of said compression spring (6);
 
   characterized in that 
said pull-in member (2) includes a locking part (4A, 
4B, 5A, 5B) engageable with and disengageable from said 

supporting member (3) to maintain said compression spring 
(6) by causing said locking part (4A, 4B, 5A, 5B) to be 

engaged with said supporting member (3); and 
a restricting member (7) contacting said locking part 
(4A, 4B, 5A, 5B) for restricting movement thereof in the 

direction in which the engagement of said locking part (4A, 
4B, 5A, 5B) is released;
 
   wherein said seat belt is tightened by the expansion of 

said spring (6) caused by the release of contact between 
said locking part (4A, 4B, 5A, 5B) and said restricting 

member (7) and engagement of said locking part (4A, 4B, 5A, 
5B) with said supporting member (3) when deceleration of 

the vehicle exceeds the predetermined value. 
The belt tightener for a seat belt according to 
claim 1, wherein said pull-in member (2) includes a means  

 
for re-engagement movable in the direction of pull-out 

movement of said seat belt after said compression spring 
expands. 
The belt tightener for a seat belt according to 
claim 2, wherein said supporting member (3) includes means 

for moving in a direction in which a space formed between 
said supporting member (3) and said restricting member (7), 

and smaller than said locking part (4A, 4B, 5A, 5B), widens 
when deceleration of the vehicle exceeds the predetermined 

value. 
The belt tightener for a seat belt according to 
claims 1 or 3, wherein said restricting member (7) includes 

means for moving in a direction of movement of said locking 
part (4A, 4B, 5A, 5B) when said pull-in member (2) moves in 

the direction of pull-out movement of said seat belt for 
re-engagement after said compression spring (6) expands, 

thus forming said space larger than said locking part (4A, 
4B, 5A, 5B) and said locking part (4A, 4B, 5A, 5B) 

re-engages with said supporting member (3) to maintain said 
restricting member (7) in the compressed state.

claims 1 or 4, wherein said locking part comprises: 


a plate member (4A, 4B) connecting with said connecting 
member, which gradually expands in a radial direction of 

said compression spring (6), and 
a stopper (5A, 5B) provided at a tip end part of said 
plate member (4A, 4B) and contacting said supporting member 

(3) and said restricting member (7) facing said supporting 

member (3). 
The belt tightener for a seat belt according to 
claims 1 or 5, wherein said compression spring (6) and said 

pull-in member (2) jointly form a mass body movable 
according to deceleration of the vehicle.
