<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the catalytic vapor
phase ammoxidation of C3 to C5 olefins to a,b-unsaturated
mononitriles and HCN. In a more particular aspect the
invention relates to a method for the catalytic vapor phase
ammoxidation (1) of propylene to produce acrylonitrile and HCN
and (2) isobutylene to produce methacrylonitrile and HCN. In
the term "a,b-unsaturated mononitriles", "unsaturated" means
ethylenic unsaturation, and the term does not include
acetylenic unsaturation.The present method employs an oxidic catalyst containing
V, Sb and one or more of Sn, Ti, Fe and Ga promoters which
increase the activity.U.S. Patent 4,162,992 discloses the ammoxidation of
olefins, especially propylene, using a catalyst having the
formula
SbaVTicOx
where a is at least 6 and c is a number such that the ratio
c/a is at least 0.5. As will be seen, however, the amount of
Sb is far outside the range of the catalysts used in the
presently claimed process.In U.S. patent 3,681,421 to Barclay etal. there is
disclosed the vapor phase catalytic ammoxidation of propylene
over an oxide composition comprising antimony, vanadium and
one or more additional polyvalent metals selected from tin,
iron, cobalt and titanium in proportion 1 gm atom of antimony,
0.12 to 0.5 gm. atoms of vanadium and 0.25 to 0.5 gm atoms of
each such additional polyvalent metal. This catalyst thus
contains at least 2 atoms of Sb per atom of V, plus a minimum
of 1/2 atom each of the foregoing polyvalent metals which is
present, thus overlapping the empirical formulas of the
compositions of the catalysts used in the method of the
present invention. The empirical formula of Example 1 of 
Barclay etal. is VSb2Sn, and of Example 3 is VSb2Ti0.79 and thus overlap the
empirical formula of the catalysts of the present invention. The catalysts used in the
present method, however, are made in a different manner from the catalysts of the
Barclay etal. patent that overlap the empirical formula of compositions of the
catalysts of the present invention.EP-A-31693 discloses using catalysts comprising a tin antimonate oxide
complex of the formula:
AaDbTedSneSbfOxwhereinA represents one or more of the following elements: Cu, V, W and
Mo;
D represents one or more of the following elements: Bi, Ti, Ge, Ce,
La, Cr, Mn, Mg, Ca, Co, Ni, Nb, Ta, Ag, Zn, Cd, K, Cs, U, B, P
and Eu;
andwhereina is 0.001 to 10;
b is 0 to 10;
d is 0.001 to 10;
e is 0.1 to 10;
f is 1 to 20;f > a + b + d + e; and
x is a number sufficient to satisfy the valence requirements of the
other

and where the preparation of the catalyst includes firstly contacting in
an aqueous dispersion only a vanadium compound and an antimony

compound while said vanadium compound is in solution, heating the
resulting slurry until the color of the slurry changes from yellow to

green to black, adding components M and optionally N and calcining 
the catalyst at a temperature greater than 750°C.

and isobutylene is ammoxidized to acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile,

respectively.

A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein m is at most 1.
