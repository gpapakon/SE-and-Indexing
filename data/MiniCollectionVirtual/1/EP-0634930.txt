<ABSTRACT>
Novel cyclohexane-ylidene derivatives of formula (I) are described. These compounds inhibit the production of Tumor Necrosis Factor and are useful in the treatment of disease states mediated or exacerbated by TNF production. These compounds are also useful in the mediation or inhibition of enzymatic or catalytic activity of phosphodiesterase IV and are therefore useful in the treatment of disease states in need of mediation or inhibition thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Compounds Useful for Treating Allergic and Inflammatory Diseases*Field of InventionThe present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their use in treating allergic and inflammatory diseases and for inhibiting the production of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).Background of the InventionBronchial asthma is a complex, multifactorial disease characterized by reversible narrowing of the airway and hyperreactivity of the respiratory tract to external stimuli. Identification of novel therapeutic agents for asthma is made difficult by the fact that multiple mediators are responsible for the development of the disease. Thus, it seems unlikely that eliminating the effects of a single mediator will have a substantial effect on all three components of chronic asthma. An alternative to the "mediator approach" is to regulate the activity of the cells responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease. One such way is by elevating levels of cAMP (adenosine cyclic 3',5'- monophosphate). Cyclic AMP has been shown to be a second messenger mediating the biologic responses to a wide range of hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs; [Krebs Endocrinology Proceedings of the 4th International Congress Excerpta Medica, 17-29, 1973]. When the appropriate agonist binds to specific cell surface receptors, adenylate cyclase is activated, which converts Mg+^-ATP to cAMP at an accelerated rate.Cyclic AMP modulates the activity of most, if not all, of the cells that contribute to the pathophysiology of extrinsic (allergic) asthma. As such, an elevation of cAMP would produce beneficial effects including: 1) airway smooth muscle relaxation, 2) inhibition of mast cell mediator release, 3) suppression of neutrophil degranulation, 4) inhibition of basophil degranulation, and 5) inhibition of monocyte and macrophage activation. Hence, compounds that activate adenylate cyclase or inhibit phosphodiesterase should be effective in suppressing the inappropriate activation of airway smooth muscle and a wide variety of inflammatory cells. The principal cellular mechanism for the inactivation of cAMP is hydrolysis of the 3'-phosphodiester bond by one or more of a family of isozymes referred to as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs).It has now been shown that a distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozyme, PDE IV, is responsible for cAMP breakdown in airway smooth muscle and inflammatory cells.
