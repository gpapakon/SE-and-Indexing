<ABSTRACT>
A writing instrument contains, in its own container, a 
color ink agent mixing at least one electron donative coloring 

compound and one electron acceptive developing compound. The 
electron donative coloring compound is selected from a group 

composed of crystal violet lactone; malachite green lactone; 
1.3-dimethyl-6- diethylaminofluoran; 6-diethylamino-benzo[α]
-fluoran; 
3-cyclohexyl methylamino-6-methyl-7-anilinofluoran; 

benzoyl leucomethylene blue; ethyl leucomethylene blue; 
methoxybenzoyl leucomethylene blue; 2-(phenylimino 

ethanedilidene)-3.3-trimethyl-indoline; 
1.3.3-trimethyl-indolino-7'-chloro-β-naphthospiropyran; di-β-naphthospiropyran; 

N-acetylauramine; N-phenylauramine; and 
rhodamine B lactam. The electron acceptive developing compound 

is selected from a group composed of zinc salicylate and 
bisphenol A.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a writing instrument 
capable of instantly discoloring written letters and the like by 
applying water thereto, enabling easy erasure and correction of 
letters as well as restoration of such letters that has been once 
erased. As writing instruments, pencils, fountain pens, ball-point 
pens, water-based and oil-based felt-tipped pens and the 
like are widely known in prior art. Such prints as graphics and 
letters written with the above mentioned instrument must have 
been erased or corrected by using, for example, an eraser with a 
pencil and an ink erasing fluid with a fountain pen for a 
bleaching effect. In the case of a felt-tipped pen or the like, 
although a print can be erased, if it is written on a non-permeable 
surface such as glass and plastic, by wiping it off 
with a sheet of paper or cloth containing a solvent for solving 
the ink, if it is written on such permeable surface as paper and 
cloth, because the ink penetrates into the surface, it is 
difficult to erase the print even by using such solvent. As a 
result, the use of a white correction fluid or white correction 
tape, for example, is accordingly required in such case for 
covering and hiding the written print. As mentioned above, in the conventional writing 
instrument, it is an inconvenience that a special member such as 
an eraser, an ink erasing fluid and a white fluid or tape must  
 
be employed for erasure and correction of a written print. Thus, 
introduction of a writing instrument capable of allowing easier 
erasure and correction has been strongly demanded in these days. Also, an ink with powdery pigments suspended and mixed in 
an alcohol is used in a so-called whiteboard marker for use with 
a whiteboard. Then, after a written print is dried, only the 
powdery pigments are adhered to the whiteboard, and easily wiped 
off with such cloth as a whiteboard eraser. However, such 
erasure is allowed only on a non-permeable surface such as 
whiteboard. And such problems are presented that the powdery 
pigments are dispersed and contaminate the vicinity, when they 
are wiped off. Further, blur in writing may be caused because a 
high-speed writing cannot be followed due to such characteristic 
of the ink that the efficiency of sucking the pigment is 
inferior.  
 The EP-A-0 438 608 discloses a representing utensil for use in making 
an invisibly depicted matter visible again which houses a coloring 
assistant in its own container.  
 Thus, in consideration of such circumstances, the 
inventor
