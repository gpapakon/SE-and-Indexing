<ABSTRACT>
A generally rectangular wire grid (40) of welded construction is utilized to define and maintain the positioning of rebar (132) charged therethrough during the formation of structural column and girder cages. Prepositioned ties (46) guide the rebar through the grid. The prepositioned ties (46) are then tightened such that the rebar is held firmly in place at the close tolerance positions defined by the prefabricated grid. A plurality of such grids are assembled into expandable bundles (100) such that they may be expanded in an accordion-like fashion about rebar (132) charged therethrough, resulting in properly spaced grids for defining and maintaining the position of the rebar. Additional rebar members (132) may then be charged therethrough to complete the construction of a column or girder cage. The modular reinforcement cages of the present invention thus eliminate piecemeal engineering requirements by providing modular building concepts in which a unique rebar bundle pattern facilitates improved containment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to building
construction and more particularly to a ductile reinforced
concrete frame comprising prefabricated welded grids for
defining and maintaining the position of rebar charged
therethrough such that high tolerances are maintained,
metal usage is minimized, and improved structural strength
is obtained. Ductility is improved, thereby reducing the
amount of earthquake resisting material required by
reducing the seismic forces that the structure must resist.
The present invention thus provides a unique rebar bundle
pattern for improved confinement. Modular building
concepts eliminate piecemeal engineering requirements.Frames comprised of reinforced concrete columns and
girders for constructing buildings are well known. Such
contemporary columns and girders are commonly constructed
by first forming a latticework of rebar, i.e., a cage,
which reinforces and contains the concrete. The cage,
generally defining the column or girder, is surrounded by
a form, commonly constructed of steel or fiberglass.
Concrete is then poured into the form such that the cage is
encapsulated thereby. The concrete is then typically
vibrated to remove any voids formed therein. The form may
be constructed in place such that the resulting column or
girder need not be moved after the concrete cures. 
Alternatively, the form may be constructed at a convenient
location, and the column or girder thus fabricated
subsequently moved to its final location.In multi-level commercial buildings, the steel
latticeworks or cages for such columns and girders are
commonly constructed by first disposing a plurality of
elongate members or rebar upon a series of supports or
horses and then positioning a plurality of sections of
smaller diameter rebar or wire formed into generally
rectangular hoops about the larger elongate rebar members
to generally define the desired cage. Further elongate
members may then be charged through these rectangular hoops
and secured in position via wire ties.As can be appreciated, this process is extremely labor
intensive. Additionally, very loose tolerances, typically
approximately 1/2 inch, are maintained due to the difficult
nature of handling and aligning such materials. Thus, the
lateral position of an elongate rebar member at the
intersection of one rectangular hoop may vary by as much as
1/2 inch relative to its position at the intersection of
another rectangular hoop. Such large tolerances are not
desired. They are tolerated by building codes because of
the present-day
