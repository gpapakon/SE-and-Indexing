<ABSTRACT>
The method involves detecting a printed registration mark (1) composed of signs (3a to 3e) and of colour printing flags (4a, 4c), comparing the image of the signs (3a to 3e) of the printed registration mark (1) with the signs of a virtual reference registration mark, then subsequently defining a base area (5a to 5c) for each sign (3a to 3e), calculating the geometrical centres (6a to 6c) of each base area (5a to 5c), detecting a colour printing flag (4a to 4c) in these base areas, calculating and storing their geometrical centre (7a to 7c), measuring the position deviations ( DELTA x to  DELTA x
<

 and  DELTA y to  DELTA y
<

) between the geometrical centres (6a to 6c) of the base areas (5a to 5c) and the geometrical centres (7a to 7c) of the colour printing flags (4a to 4c), and finally using these results in order to control the member for correcting the registration errors of a printing press.

Method for detecting registration marks in a 
multicolour printing press processing webs or sheets 

with an area for printing the image and another area 
for printing the marks allowing to check the print 

accuracy, characterized by its being successively 
capable of: 


comparing a printed registration mark (1) 
with at least two recognition signs (3a to 3e) and a 

colour pilot mark (4a to 4c or 10a to 10c) with a 
virtual referential registration mark (13) of similar 

configuration, though including only the recognition 
signs (15a to 15e); 
determining at least a basic area (5a to 5c) 
for scanning the colour pilot mark (4a to 4c or 10a to 

10c) for each recognition sign (3a to 3e or 9a to 9e); 
calculating and memorizing the geometric 
centre (6a to 6c) of every basic area (5a to 5c) for 

scanning the colour pilot mark (4a to 4c or 10a to 
10c); 
successively detecting the colour pilot marks 
(4a to 4c or 10a to 10c) within every basic area (5a 

to 5c); 
calculating and memorizing the geometric 
centre (7a to 7c or 12a to 12c) of every colour pilot 

mark (4a to 4c or 10a to 10c) detected; 
measuring along both the ordinate and 
abscissa axes the off-line positions (Δx, Δy) 

between the geometric centre (6a to 6c) of the basic 
area (5a to 5c), and the geometric centre (7a to 7c or 

12a to 12c) of the colour pilot mark (4a to 4c or 10a 
to 10c);

off-line positions (Δx, Δy) into control values to  

 
be used for acting on the misregister correction 

appliance.

by the comparison of registration marks (1) printed 

into the print area containing the print accuracy 
control signs to virtual referential registration 

marks (13) previously memorized. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized 
by the comparison of registration marks (1) invisible 

to the naked eye to virtual referential registration 
marks (13) previously memorized. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that after determining a basic area (5a to 

5c) for scanning the colour pilot mark (4a to 4c or 
10a to 10c), the said basic area (5a to 5c) is 

enlarged, though with geometric centre (6a to 6c) of 
the basic area (5a to 5c) kept as centre of the new 

area (11a to 11c) thus determined.
