<ABSTRACT>
A bulb socket has a socket main body and a pair of bulb 
clamping pieces for holding a base of a bulb. The bulb 

clamping pieces have projection pieces formed by cutting out 
and raised up so that not only the base of the bulb is clamped 

by the bulb clamping pieces by resiliency, but also the edges 
of the clamping pieces bite into and catch leads raised and 

bent along the base. Alternatively, a first holding portion 
and a second holding portion are provided in each of clamping 

pieces to hold a base of the bulb by way of two-point support 
by the first and second holding portion of each of the clamping 

pieces. As a result, the bulb holding force is so increased as 
to reliably prevent the bulb from being detached from the bulb 

socket even if the bulb is located at a position susceptible to 
impact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bulb socket that feeds power to 
a wedge base bulb by holding the wedge base bulb, more 
particularly, to an improved bulb socket that can effectively 
keep the bulb from being detached therefrom. A wedge base bulb and a bulb socket to which the wedge base 
bulb is attached are used, e.g., in a lamp of an automobile. 
Generally, the bulb socket has a socket main body, and inside 
the socket main body is a bulb holding chamber that is opened 
upward to allow the bulb to be accommodated therein. A pair of 
bulb clamping pieces having resiliency are attached to the 
inside of the bulb holding chamber so that the base portion of 
the bulb inserted into the bulb holding chamber can be clamped 
with resiliency and come in contact with leads extending on the 
base to electrically connect the bulb socket to the bulb. For, example, a bulb socket for feeding power by holding a 
wedge base bulb such as shown in Figure 1 has heretofore been 
known. That is, a bulb insertion hole 104 that allows a base 
portion 103a of a wedge base bulb 103 to be inserted thereinto 
and a connector insertion hole 105 that allows a connector (not 
shown) to be inserted thereinto are arranged on the upper side 
and on the lower side of the main body 102 of a bulb socket 
101. Holding metals 106, each holding the base portion 103a of 
the wedge base bulb 103 and supplying power thereto, are  
 
attached to both sides of the bulb insertion hole 104 on the 
upper side. Each holding metal 106 has a terminal 106a at a 
lower portion thereof and holding pieces 106b formed by bending 
the bifurcated portions of the terminal 106a inward in the 
middle. A pair of holding portions 106c are formed by further 
bending the upper portions of the holding pieces 106b inward to 
be given resiliency for clamping the base portion 103a. To attach the wedge base bulb 103 to the thus constructed 
socket main body 102, the base portion 103a is inserted into 
the bulb insertion hole 104 and then set between the holding 
portions 106c. As a result, the holding portions 106c come to 
clamp the base portion 103a by way of single-point support at 
both left and right sides to allow the wedge base bulb 103 to 
be attached to the socket main body 102. However, such conventional structure addresses the problem 
that the holding strength is weak, because the base portion 
103a of the wedge base bulb 103 is attached to the socket main 
body 102 while held by way of single-point support, i.e., only 
by the holding portions 106c of the

<CLAIMS>
A bulb socket for holding a wedge base bulb (201) comprising: 

a main body (211) having a bulb holding chamber (215); 
bulb clamping pieces (222) attached inside said bulb 
holding chamber (215), said clamping pieces clamping a base 

(204) of a bulb and being connectable to leads (206, 206a) 
extending on said base and having formed thereon edges 

(230) cooperating with said base for preventing falling off 
of said bulb (201), 
 
   characterized in that said edges have the form of 

biting edges for biting into said leads to prevent falling 
off. 
A bulb socket according to claim 1, wherein the edges 
(230) are distal end edges of projected pieces (229) cut 

out and raised from the bulb clamping pieces (222). 
A bulb socket according to claim 1, wherein the edges 
(230a,b) are end edges folded back (232) on the bulb clamping 

pieces (222a,b). 
A bulb socket according to claim 1, wherein the edges 
(230c) are edges of window openings (234) formed in the 

bulb clamping pieces (222c). 
A bulb socket (110) for holding a wedge base bulb 
(112) comprising: 


a main body (111) having a bulb holding chamber; 
a holding member (120) being electrically connected to 
a terminal (122) including a pair of holding piece members 

(126) for clamping a base portion of the wedge base bulb, 
characterized in that, each holding piece member has a 

first holding portion (128) and a second holding portion  
 

(130) extending in a direction of insertion of the base 
portion; 
wherein each of the first and second holding pieces 
has a center of swing (124a) between said first and second 

holding portions, and the second holding portions disposed 
on a deeper side in direction of insertion of the base portion 

are expandable as the base portion is further inserted.
