<DESCRIPTION>
 FILM-FORMING X-RAY CONTRAST COMPOSITIONS.<This is a continuation-in-part of Appliction Serial Number 07/877,690 filed on May 1, 1992.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1 0Field of the InventionThis invention relates to an x-ray contrast composition for oral or retrograde administration to a mammal comprising a barium salt as the1 5 contrast producing agent and a polymeric film-forming material.Reported DevelopmentsRoentgenographic examination utilizing x-rays and computed20 tomography (hereinafter CT) scans of fractures and other conditions associated with the skeletal system is routinely practiced without the use of contrast agents. X-ray visualization of organs containing soft tissue, such as the gastrointestinal (hereinafter GI) tract, requires the use of contrast agents which attenuate x-ray radiation. D. P. Swanson et al in2 5 "Pharmaceuticals In Medical Imaging", 1990, MacMillan PublishingCompany, provides an excellent background in medical imaging utilizing contrast agents and compositions therewith.The desiderata for an ideal GI contrast agent includes: good3 0 toxicological profile; the ability to fill the entire bowel/lumen and evenly coat the gut mucosa so that the presence of the bowel is detectable when the lumen is not distended; palatability and nonirritation to the intestinal mucosa; and passing through the GI tract without producing artifacts or stimulating vigorous intestinal peristalsis. 3 5 

 The most widely used contrast agents for the visualization of the GI tract is barium sulfate administered as a suspension orally or rectally as an enema. (See for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,659,690; 2,680,089; 3,216,900; 3,235,462; 4,038,379 and 4,120,946) Notwithstanding its relatively good contrast characteristics, negligible absorption from the GI tract following oral or rectal administration and speedy excretion from the body, barium sulfate has certain disadvantages. In the presence of intestinal fluids, it lacks homogeneity which can result in poor x-ray images. In the colon, when administered as an enema, it flocculates and forms irregular clumps with fecal matter. The prior art considers as a serious problem the difficulty in achieving uniform adherence to, and coating of, the mucosa of the GI tract by the water insoluble barium sulfate to provide high quality x- ray photographs. As a result of inadequate adherence to, and non-uniform coating of the mucosa, the x-ray results are often inferior, misleading to the practitioner and the imaging process must be repeated. It has also been observed
