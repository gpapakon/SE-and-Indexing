<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a washing machine for cleaning elongate workpieces, for example hollow profiles, rods, shafts or the like. It consists of a motor-driven washing drum (1) mounted rotatably in a housing and of receiving chambers (2) arranged on the circumference of the washing drum (1) and intended for the articles or workpieces to be cleaned, as well as with a material feed (7) and a material discharge (8) and devices for supplying the washing liquid. The material feed (7) consists of a feed drum (9) extending parallel to the washing drum (1) and having workpiece chambers (10) arranged on its circumference and of an entry orifice (13) formed on the feed drum (9) and of a feed orifice (14). At the same time, the washing drum (1) and the feed drum (9) are driven in opposite directions, and their rotational speed is such that the receiving chambers (2) and the workpiece chambers (10) meet one another synchronously at the feed orifice (14).
