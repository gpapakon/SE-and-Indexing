<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus, such as a copier or a printer for 
reproducing an image on a recording sheet. The apparatus 

includes: a photoreceptor drum (100); a latent image writer for 
forming a latent image of the image on the surface of the 

photoreceptor drum (100); black, yellow (201), magenta (202), and cyan 
(203) developers each for developing the latent image with a 

respective color toner so as to form a respective color 
developed latent image on the surface; a transferor (130) for 

transferring the color developed latent images from the 
surface to the recording sheet; a cleaner (116) for cleaning a 

residual toner on the surface after a transferring operation 
of the transferor; a color developer cartridge (2001;2003) for unitedly 

supporting the yellow, magenta, and cyan developers; a process 
cartridge for unitedly supporting the photoreceptor drum, the 

black developer, and the cleaner; and a coupler for coupling 
the color developer cartridge and the process cartridge to the 

apparatus. The color developer cartridge and the process 
cartridge are detachable from the apparatus and the process 

cartridge is prevented from being detached from the apparatus 
until the color developer cartridge is detached from the 

apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color image forming 
apparatus using a photoreceptor drum or a photoreceptor belt 
on the surface of which a toner image is formed, and 
specifically to a color image forming apparatus by which a 
color image can be recorded other than a black toner image 
when color developing units are optionally equipped to the 
apparatus. Conventionally, the following is known: a plurality of 
developing units are provided around the photoreceptor drum or 
photoreceptor belt in an image recording apparatus having the 
photoreceptor drum or photoreceptor belt. Specifically, an 
apparatus in which the photoreceptor belt is used is suitable 
for color image recording, for which many developing units are 
necessary. Because the developing units can be provided in 
almost the same condition. In this case, a black toner image 
and a color image can be recorded when 4 developing units are  
 
provided in which yellow, magenta, cyan and black toners are 
respectively loaded. In the conventional color image forming 
apparatus described above, in order to easily replace 4 
developing units or in order to easily supply toners to the 
developing units, 4 developing units can be attached to and 
detached from the apparatus together with the photoreceptor 
drum or photoreceptor belt, or 4 developing units can be 
integrally attached to and detached from the apparatus 
independently from the photoreceptor drum or photoreceptor 
belt. However, when only a black toner image is recorded, 
developing units other than that for black toner are surplus. 
In order to replenish the frequently used black toner, other 
developing units should be detached from and attached to the 
apparatus together with the developing unit for black toner, 
which is ineffectual and can cause problems.  
 EP-A-0397465 describes a color image forming apparatus for forming 
a color image comprising: 
an image retainer for carrying a color image, a charging means for charging a surface of the image retainer, a means for forming a latent image on the charged surface of the image 
retainer, a multicolor developing means for developing the latent image, a black developing means for developing the latent image, a means for conveying a transfer sheet and transferring a developed latent 
image on to the transfer sheet, and 
a cleaning means for cleaning a residual developer on the surface of the image 
retainer, In one embodiment the image retainer, black developing means and 
cleaning means are formed as a detachable processing

An image forming apparatus for reproducing an image on a recording 
sheet, comprising: 


an image forming body (100), provided for being rotatable about a 
rotation axis and having a photoreceptor surface: 
a latent image forming means (1131, 1132) for forming a latent image 
of said image on a surface of said image forming body (100); 
a black developer means (204) for developing said latent image with a 
black color toner so as to form a black color toner image on said 

surface; 
a yellow developer means (201) for developing said latent image with 
a yellow color toner so as to form a yellow color toner image on 

said surface; 
a magenta developer means (202) for developing said latent image with 
a magenta color toner so as to form a magenta color toner image 

on said surface; 
a cyan developer means (203) for developing said latent image with a 
cyan color toner so as to form a cyan color toner image on said 

surface; 
a transfer means (130) for transferring at least one of said black color 
toner image, said yellow color toner image, said 

magenta color toner image, and said cyan color toner 
image from said surface to said recording sheet; 
a cleaning means (116) for cleaning residual toner on said surface after 
a transferring operation of said transfer means (130); 
a color developer cartridge (2001) for unitedly supporting said 
yellow developer means (201), said magenta developer means (202), and said 

cyan developer means (203); said color developer cartridge (2001) 
being detachable from said image forming apparatus; and  

 
a process cartridge (2102) for unitedly supporting said image 
forming body (100), said black developer means (204), and said cleaning 

means (116); said process cartridge (2102) being detachable from said 
image forming apparatus; 
 
   characterized in that said color developer cartridge (2001) and 

said process cartridge (2102) are respectively fixed to said image forming apparatus and arranged relatively to each other in 
such a manner that said color developer cartridge (2001) interferes 

with said process cartridge (2102) and said process cartridge 
(2102) is prevented from being detached from said image forming apparatus 

until said color developer cartridge (2001) is detached from said image 
forming apparatus, 


and in that said black developer means (204) includes a replenishing 
port (204S) for receiving a toner independently from the attaching state of 

said color developer cartridge to said image forming apparatus; and a 
toner hopper (204H) for storing a toner connected to said replenishing port for supplying toner, said toner hopper (204H) having an opening and an openable cover (204C) therefor and being 

capable of receiving through said opening new toner regardless of the attaching state of said color 
developer cartridge (2001) to said image forming apparatus; 
said yellow developer means (201) includes a toner hopper (201H) for 
storing a toner wherein said toner hopper (201H) is unitedly formed with said 

yellow developer means (201), 
said magenta developer means (202) includes a toner hopper (202H) for
