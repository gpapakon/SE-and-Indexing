<ABSTRACT>
To determine the density of a stream of fibrous 
material (17) on a cigarette manufacturing machine (1), 

two different measurements are performed, the first (18) 
of which is capacitive and supplies a first signal as a 

function of the density of the dry component and of the 
density of the liquid in the stream of fibrous material, 

and the second (19) of which is optical and supplies a 
second signal indicating the density of the dry 

component; the second signal is combined with the first 
signal to obtain a third signal indicating the density 

of the liquid in the stream of fibrous material; and, 
from the third and second signals, a fourth signal is 

obtained indicating the density of the stream of fibrous 
material as the sum of the density of the dry component 

and of the liquid in the stream of fibrous material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
device for determining the density of a stream of 
fibrous material on a cigarette manufacturing machine. In the following description, reference is made 
purely by way of example to a cigarette manufacturing 
machine and to determination of the tobacco density of a 
continuous cigarette rod. As is known, on cigarette manufacturing machines, 
a suction conveyor belt draws the tobacco from a tank 
and deposits it on to a continuous strip of paper; the 
longitudinal edges of the paper strip are then folded 
one on top of the other about the tobacco; and the 
continuous cigarette rod so formed is fed to a cutting 
station where it is cut into single or double 
cigarettes. The tobacco is normally supplied in such a manner 
as to be distributed unevenly inside the cigarette, and 
more specifically in such a manner as to be denser at  
 
the two ends than in the center, to prevent tobacco 
fallout and detachment of the filter from the cigarette, 
and at the same time ensure correct ventilation of the 
intermediate portion of the cigarette. This is achieved 
by supplying a greater quantity of tobacco at the ends 
of the cigarette as compared with the center, for which 
purpose, a rotary shaving device is provided along the 
path of the tobacco on the conveyor, for shaving it into 
the contour corresponding to the required density. The 
shaving device is both height adjustable for controlling 
the mean quantity of tobacco in each cigarette (mean 
density or weight), and time adjustable for obtaining a 
maximum quantity of tobacco at the point at which the 
continuous cigarette rod is cut (adjacent ends of two 
cigarettes); which adjustment is made according to the 
discrepancy between the desired distribution of the 
tobacco and the actual distribution determined on the 
cigarette rod upstream from the cutting station. Various solutions currently exist for determining 
the actual distribution of the tobacco, most of which 
feature a beta-ray sensor comprising a radioactive 
source and a beta ray detector located on either side of 
the cigarette rod, along the path of the rod between the 
forming and cutting stations. The radioactive source 
typically comprises a strontium (Sr90) pellet, and is 
housed inside a shielded container with a hole facing 
the cigarette rod; and the detector comprises an 
ionization chamber and an electrometer for measuring the  
 
energy of the incoming radiation. On the basis of 
fluctuations in the incoming radiation, an electronic 
syst
