<ABSTRACT>
Covering housings for electrical measuring or metering devices generally require a transparent front for reading a measuring dial or a meter; if such measuring or metering devices are used for costing power consumption or the like, it must be ensured that the transparent insert cannot be removed. In electrical current meters, plates of glass or transparent thermoplastic are used for this purpose, which are locked bonded or not bonded in the covering housing. According to the invention, it is much simpler if such a transparent panel is directly injection moulded in the covering housing of a thermoplastic plastic. Such a housing can be manufactured much more efficiently, is absolutely dustproof and can also be made absolutely intervention proof with a corresponding design of the joint between the thermoplastic plastic and the covering housing which in most cases consists of a duroplastic material.
