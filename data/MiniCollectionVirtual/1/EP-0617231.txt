<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for operating an oil evaporation burner for heating boilers which, for the purpose of reducing pollutants, are operated with waste-gas recirculation from the combustion chamber (K) of the heating boiler into the burner. In the case of such oil evaporation burners, difficulties are caused by the waste-gas recirculation during the start-up phase in so far as the burner often goes out during the start-up phase. In order to overcome these difficulties, the recirculated waste-gas stream is interrupted during the start-up phase, to be precise in a pneumatic manner by forming barrier curtains from air which has been supplied. The oil evaporation burner intended therefor comprises a housing (1) with a funnel (3) for forming a swirling flow, there being arranged, on the funnel (3), at least one injector (5) for introducing the combustion air and taking in waste gases from the combustion chamber (K), and an oil-supply line (2) with nozzle (D) being directed into the funnel (3), and there being further arranged, in front of the injector (5), an air-supply chamber (6) with air-outflow openings (8) directed into the injector (5). Arranged on at least one injector (5) is at least one air-supply duct, such as small tubes (9), with openings (14) directed transversely into the inflow opening (5') of the injector (5), and the air-supply duct is provided with means for the controlled interruption of the air supply at the end of the start-up phase of the burner.

A process of operating an oil evaporating burner, wherein the injected liquid fuel is
further dissolved in a swirl flow diverging in the out-flow direction, while supplying

pressurized combustion air and admixing exhaust gases recirculated into the burner,
characterized in that recirculation and introduction of the exhaust gases into the swirl

flow is effected only after completion of the burner start-up phase thereby preventing the
supply of recirculated exhaust gases during the start-up phase with the aid of

pneumatically generated barrier curtains of air.
An oil evaporating burner for carrying out the process according to claim 1,
comprising a casing (1) having a funnel (3) for forming a swirl flow, with injectors (5)

for introducing combustion air and for sucking off exhaust gases from the combustion
chamber (K) being arranged on funnel (3) and an oil supply conduit (2) with the

atomizing jet (D) being guided into funnel (3), and with an air supply chamber (6) with
air outlet openings (8) guided into injectors (5) being located ahead of injectors (5),

characterized in that arranged on injectors (5) is an air supply channel, e.g. a tubule (9)
with openings (14) extending in the transverse direction into an exhaust gas inlet opening

(5') confined by wall (3) of injector (5) and wall (7) of air supply chamber (6) and with
the air supply channel being provided with means for discontinuing, in a controlled way,

the air supply at the end of the start-up phase of the burner.
An oil evaporating burner according to claim 2, characterized in that two injectors (5)
including respectively at least one tubule (9) are arranged diagonally opposite on funnel

(3), and that associated to each injector (5) is an air supply chamber (6) provided with air 
outlet openings (8), with the said air chambers (6) confining a shaft (4) within casing (1),

open toward two sides.
An oil evaporating burner according to claim 3, characterized in that the injectors (5)
are open at both sides toward the shaft (4) and that respectively one tubule (9) is

arranged on both sides of each exhaust gas inlet opening (5') of the injectors (5).
An oil evaporating burner according to claim 3, characterized in that the injectors (5)

are open on one side toward the shaft (4), and that arranged on the exhaust gas inlet
openings of the injectors (5) is a tubule (9).
An oil evaporating burner according to any one of claims 3 to 5, characterized in that
the tubules (9) are connected to an air supply chamber (6) forming the bottom (10) of

the shaft (4), to which air supply chamber (6) is connected an air supply conduit (13),
with the said air supply chamber (6) being provided with a central passage channel (12)

for the oil supply conduit (2).
An oil evaporating burner according to any one of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that
the air supply conduit (13) for the at least one tubule (9) is provided with a separate

blowpipe (16) the drive (16') of which is in switching communication with a timer (18)
or a thermosensor (19).
An oil evaporating burner according to any one of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that
the air supply conduit (13) for the at least one tubule (9) is in communication with the

burner blowpipe (17) for the supply of combustion air to the burner, and that the air
supply conduit (13) is provided with a valve (20) the servo drive (20') of which is in

switching communication with a timer (18) or a thermosensor (19).
