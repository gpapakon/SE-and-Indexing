<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling the inside temperature of a plurality of air conditioned rooms in a building, which are fitted with self-regulating heat exchangers (7a-c) which are supplied via a distribution system (2) with a heat exchange fluid (liquid), in particular water. Improved control and regulation of room temperatures are achieved when the distribution system (2) has at least 3 lines (3, 4, 5) of which 2 are provided as feed (inflow) lines (3, 5) having mutually differing feed temperatures, and one is provided as a common return line (4), and when means are provided which, depending on the inside temperature desired, can optionally be used to connect the heat exchangers (7a-c) to the one or other feed line (3 or 5, respectively).
