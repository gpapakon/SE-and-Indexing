<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thermoplastic polymer 
composition comprising the following components: 
a. a thermoplastic polyester and b. a polymer comprising vinylaromatic monomer units and 
dicarboxylic acid anhydride monomer units and/or imide 
compounds derived therefrom. Such a polymer composition is known from EP-A-0 042 724, EP-A-0 042 737 and EP-B0,273,897. 
In these documents polymer compositions of polyethylene 
terephthalate and a styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer are 
described. A disadvantage of the known polymer compositions 
is that its impact strength is too low. The object of the invention is to provide a polymer 
composition which does not suffer from the above 
disadvantage. This is achieved in that component b. contains at 
least 1% by weight of spirodilactone monomer units. This is 
surprising since component b. in itself is a relatively 
brittle polymer. Preferably, component b. contains at least 
2% by weight of spirodilactone monomer units and more 
especially component b. contains at least 4% by weight of 
spirodilactone monomer units. A further advantage of the polymer composition 
according to the invention is that in addition to improved 
impact strength it also has a higher deflection temperature 
under load (Vicat). As a result, the polymer composition 
according to the invention can be used in articles which are 
exposed to elevated temperatures. Yet a further advantage of the polymer composition 
according to the invention is that it has an improved 
thermal stability compared with the known polymer 
composition. As a result, mouldings which are produced from 
this polymer composition can be used in articles which are 
exposed for lengthy periods to elevated temperatures, such  
 
as, for example, automotive components which are mounted in 
the vicinity of the engine. Yet a further advantage of the polymer composition 
according to the invention is that a moulding produced from 
a polymer composition according to the present invention 
delaminates less rapidly than a moulding produced from the 
known polymer composition. Suitable thermoplastic polyesters for use as 
component a. can be prepared in a known manner by esterifying 
monomers having two acid-functional groups and diols 
and/or monomers having one acid-functional group and one 
hydroxyl group, an acid-functional group meaning a 
functional group chosen from amongst acid group, acid 
chloride group and anhydride group. In a preferred 
embodiment of the invention the thermoplastic polyester is 
prepared from
