<ABSTRACT>
A nestable container 10 comprises a top flap which is 
arranged to lie over an opening in the container 10 

into which a further identical container can be 
nested. The top flap is in three parts 146, 148, 150 

which are arranged to slide into one another. The top 
flap is hingedly connected to an end wall 16 of the 

container 10 so that it can be hinged around to lie 
adjacent the end wall 16 of the container 10. By 

sliding of the parts 146, 148, 150, the length of the 
top flap is reduced so that it does not interfere with 

the nesting of the container 10 into another identical 
container. The container is of the type which nests 

in one orientation and stacks in another orientation. 
The container 10 includes a hinged access flap 30 in 

one end wall 14 to allow access to the interior of the 
container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a nestable container.Nestable containers are known. It is useful to be able
to nest containers so that they take up less space when
they are empty. Where a container includes a lid, when
such containers are nested, the lids obviously must be
pivoted out and tend to protrude a significant distance
from the side of the container thus reducing the number
of empty containers which can be stored in a given
volume.According to the invention there is provided a nestable
container comprising a top flap which is arranged to lie
over an opening in the container in which a further
identical container can be nested, the top flap being
arranged to lie adjacent a side wall at an end of the
container such that it does not interfere with the
nesting of the container into another identical
container, and an access flap in a side wall of the
container which is openable to allow access to the
interior of the container, an edge of the access flap
defining an edge of the nesting opening of the container
and the access flap being hinged horizontally, the hinge
provided just above the level reached by the top of a
similar container into which the container is nested. Preferably the top flap lies parallel to the side wall
of the container or vertically.The top flap may be such that it can be manipulated to
reduce the length over which it extends down the side
of the container. The top flap may comprise two or more
parts which are arranged to slide over one another to
reduce the length of the top flap. In another
embodiment, the top flap may include at least one hinge
and nay be arranged to fold at least once to reduce its
length. The fold or the first fold preferably folds the
top flap inwards in relation to the wall of the
container. This arrangement is more compact.
Preferably, where the top flap is longer than the height
of the walls of the container, the top flap may be
manipulated to reduce the length to less than the height
of the walls of the container. Where the top flap is
longer than the part of the height of the walls of the
container which is not covered when the container is
nested in another container, the top flap may be
manipulable to reduce its length to less than that
height. The top flap may comprise two or three
manipulable parts in a preferred embodiment.The container may be of the type which can stack on
rather than nest in an identical container when rotated 
through 180° about a vertical axis. The container may
nest to any suitable degree and may nest to half its
height.The top

<CLAIMS>
A nestable container (10) comprising a top flap
(32) which is arranged to lie over an opening in the

container in which a further identical container (10)
can be nested, the top flap (32) being arranged to lie

adjacent a side wall (12) at an end of the container
(10) such that it does not interfere with the nesting of

the container into another identical container (10), and
an access flap (30) in a side wall (12) of the container

(10) which is openable to allow access to the interior
of the container, an edge of the access flap (30)

defining an edge of the nesting opening of the container
and the access flap (30) being hinged horizontally, the hinge

provided just above the level reached by the top of a
similar container (10) into which the container (10) is

nested.
A container as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the container (10) is of the type which nests in

one orientation and stacks in another orientation in
which the container has been rotated through 180° about

a vertical axis.
A container as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the access flap (30) extends over substantially

the whole of one half of the container side wall (12).
A container as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the access flap (30) is provided in a side wall

(12) at one end of the container (10).
A container as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the access flap (30) mounts a bail arm of the

container.
A container as claimed in claim 5 wherein the
bail arm is arranged to be retained on the container.
A container as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the top flap (32) is arranged to be manipulated

to reduce the length over which it extends down the side 
wall (12) of the container (10).
A container as claimed in claim 7 wherein the
top flap (32) is arranged to be manipulated at least

partly by translation to reduce the length of the top
flap (32).
A container as claimed in claim 8 wherein the
top flap (32) comprises two or more parts which are

arranged to slide over one another to reduce the length
of the top flap 32).
A container as claimed in claim 7 wherein the
top flap (32) includes at least one hinge and is

arranged to fold at least once to reduce its length.
A container as claimed in claim 10 wherein the
fold or the first fold folds the top flap inwards in

relation to the wall of the container.

11 wherein where the top flap (32) is longer than the

part of the height of the walls of the container (10)
which is not covered when the container is nested in

another container, the top flap (32) is manipulated to
