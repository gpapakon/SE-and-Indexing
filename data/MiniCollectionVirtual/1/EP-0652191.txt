<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing honeycomb ceramic structural bodies by
extrusion.In general, it is a conventional practice that a
ceramic body is obtained by making a solvent, a shaping
aid such as a binder and a surface active agent if
needed with a ceramic raw material and kneading the
mixture, and ceramic structural bodies are produced by
extruding the ceramic body by using a ceramic structural
body-extruding die. The ceramic honeycomb structural
body-extruding die has a structure provided with
discharge channels in the form of a slot-shaped lattice
and feed passages for dividingly feeding the ceramic
body to intersections of the slots of the lattice.As the shaping aid to be used for the formation of
the ceramic body, an appropriate one has been selected
heretofore, depending upon uses, among organic binders
such as methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and
polyvinyl alcohol, surface active agents and wax, as
disclosed in unexamined Japanese patent application
Laid-open No. 2-255,576.EP-A-115204 also describes the inclusion of an
oxygen-containing wax in a binder in a sinterable
inorganic powder, examples of the waxes being paraffin
wax, microcrystalline wax and low molecular weight
polyethylene. EP-A-134277 describes, for the same
purpose, a binder containing methylcellulose and fats.
GB-A-2081733 describes a binder for use in ceramic
powder molding, containing methylcellulose and wax. The
wax is preferably an emulsion. In the manufacture of a honeycomb structural body,
when the ceramic body is extruded through the
above-mentioned die provided with the discharge channels
in the form of the slot-shaped lattice and the feed
passages for dividingly feeding the ceramic body to
intersections of the slots of the lattice, the following
defects occur. That is, when the above conventional
ceramic body is used, an outer peripheral surface of the
extrudate becomes rough due to frictional resistance
between the ceramic body and the wall surfaces of the
metal die. Consequently, a surface portion of the
extrudate is stripped or cracked. Further, ribs (walls)
constituting the lattice are waved in an extruding
direction. Furthermore, the ribs are extruded, but not
united to form the lattice.It is known that the above phenomenon becomes
more conspicuous, as the hardness of the ceramic body
increases and/or as the fluidity (plastic deformation)
drops. However, if hardness of the ceramic body is
merely lessened to enhance the fluidity, there occurs
the problems in that the extruded ceramic

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a ceramic honeycomb
structural body, comprising the step of extruding a plasticized mixture

in the form of a structural
body and drying the resulting extrudate to obtain a ceramic honeycomb structural body,

characterised in that, the ceramic body is formulated by
incorporating in the ceramic raw material 0.2 to 3 wt% of

emulsified wax and 2 to 7 wt% of methyl cellulose and
plasticizing the resulting mixture for extrusion, said

emulsified wax being at least one selected from
emulsified paraffinic wax, emulsified polyethylene wax,

emulsified oxidized polyethylene wax and emulsified
glycol-modified oxidized polyethylene.
The process set forth in claim 1, wherein 0.2 to
3 wt% of at least one surface active agent is

incorporated in the ceramic raw material.
The process set forth in claim 2, where the or
each surface active agent is selected from a soap-series

surface active agent, an ester-series surface active
agent, and an ether-series surface active agent.
The process set forth in any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the thickness of walls of cells of the honeycomb

structural body is not more than 140 Âµm.
The process set forth in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the ceramic body when extruded has a

pseudo-plastic index of 2.5 to 5, and a pressure loss
index of 0.03 to 0.06.
A ceramic honeycomb structural body formed by a
process according to any one of the preceding claims.
