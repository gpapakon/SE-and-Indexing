<ABSTRACT>
A wood covering, in particular a floor wood covering, has a wood layer (2) and a support layer (3). The wood layer (2) and the support layer (3) are fixedly linked to each other. The support layer (3) is composed of pieces of thermoplastic foils (5) compacted and at least partially agglomerated by pressure and heat application.

Wood covering, in particular wood floor covering with an upper 
layer formed by a wood material layer (2) and with a supporting 

layer (3, 6) which is firmly joined to the upper layer (2) and 
comprises thermoplastic synthetic resin sheet material (5) in pieces 

compressed by the action of pressure and temperature and at least 
partially bonded together. 
Wood covering according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
synthetic resin sheet material in pieces is in the form of pieces (5) 

of polyolefin sheet, in particular polyethylene sheet. 
Wood covering according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 
other non-thermoplastic materials are mixed in with the synthetic 

resin sheet material (4, 5). 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the supporting layer (6) has a varying degree 
of density over its cross-section. 
Wood covering according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
alteration in density is continuous. 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 different regions of the area of the 
supporting layer (3, 6) are compressed to different degrees.  

 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 


characterised in that
 the supporting layer (3, 6) has layers of glass 
fibre or glass fibre mat. 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the supporting layer (3, 6) has air inclusions 
or cavities. 
Wood covering according one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the wood material layer (2) is formed by 
wood strips. 
Wood covering according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the 
wood covering is capable of being rolled up. 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the supporting layer (3, 6) is provided with a 
wood layer on both sides. 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the thickness of the supporting layer (3, 6) 
amounts to 3mm to 10mm. 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the thickness of the wood layer (2) amounts 
to about a minimum of 1mm and a maximum of about 3mm. 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 an under-layer, in particular made of glass  
 

fibre mat, a glass fibre coating or polyester fabric, is provided, 
arranged underneath the supporting layer (3, 6). 
Wood covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the appearance of the upper layer (2) is 
determined by deliberate arrangement of the wood and for example 

in the form of a mosaic. 
Method of manufacturing a wood covering according to one of 
claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that
 pieces of thermoplastic 
synthetic resin material and/or synthetic resin material are 

deposited in a number of layers to form a layer, a layer of wood 
material (2) is deposited on this layer and the two layers are 

bonded together by the action of pressure and temperature, the 
loosely deposited pieces (4) of plastics and/or pieces (5) of plastics 

sheet being compressed and joined together to form a carrier layer. 
Method of manufacturing a wood covering according to one of 
claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that
 pieces of thermoplastic 
synthetic resin sheet material are deposited in a number of layers to 

form a layer and compressed and at least partially joined together 
by the action of pressure and temperature to form a supporting 

layer (3, 6) and that subsequently a layer (2) of wood material is 
deposited on this layer (3, 6) and the two layers are bonded 

together by the action of pressure and temperature, the supporting 
layer (3, 6) being given a final compression. 
Method according to claims 16 to 17, 
characterised in that
 the 
temperature lies in the region of the softening temperature of the 

plastics employed.  
 
Method according to one of claims 16 to 18, 
characterised in that
 
an additional hot-melt adhesive coating is applied to the deposited 

layer (3, 6) of pieces (4, 5) of plastics sheet before joining to the 
wood layer (2). 
Method according to one of claims 16 to 19, 
characterised in that
 
the action of pressure and temperature is applied by a calender roll. 
Method according to one of claims 16 to 18, 
characterised in that
 
the pieces (5) of synthetic resin sheet are formed 

three-dimensionally before compression. 
Method according to one of claims 16 to 21, 
characterised in that
 
the pieces (5) of plastics sheet are of flake-like form before 

compression. 
Method according to one of claims 16 to 22, 
characterised in that
 
other materials, in particular pieces or threads of textile materials, 

are mixed in with the pieces (5) of plastics sheet. 
Method according to one of claims 16 to 23, 
characterised in that
 
the height of the layer of the deposited plastics material (5) differs 

in different regions of the surface and corresponds to the 
requirements for the different degrees of compression of the 

supporting layer (3, 6).
