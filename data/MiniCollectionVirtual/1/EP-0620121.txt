<ABSTRACT>
The incorporation of refined legume starch granules, and particularly pea 
starch granules, into carbonless paper coatings, preferably CB (coated back) coatings, 

provides an unexpected improvement in smudge and scuff resistance when compared 
to the use of other commonly used stilt materials such as wheat starch. The 

incorporation of refined legume starch granules reduces press and copier 
contamination and provides a cleaner printed sheet when printed on offset printing 

presses, electrographic and electrophotographic copier/duplicators, and laser printers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to carbonless papers incorporating refined legume starch 
as a stilting material into the CB (coated back) coatings. Carbonless papers 
incorporating refined legume starch are particularly useful when used in high speed 
electrophotographic copier/duplicators, offset printing presses, and laser printers. 
Carbonless papers incorporating refined legume starch as a stilting material are less 
prone to capsule rupture during printing operations and less prone to feeder induced 
smudging when compared with carbonless papers employing the traditionally used 
wheat starch. Carbonless impact marking papers for the transfer of images, (i.e., carbonless 
copy papers) are papers which are capable of producing an image upon application 
of pressure. Products employing this chemistry generally comprise at least two 
substrates (for example, two sheets of paper) and involve coating one reactant, known 
as a color-former, on one substrate, and the other reactant, known as a developer, on 
another "mating" substrate. One surface, or side, of each substrate is coated with one 
of the two primary reactants. The two substrates are often referred to as a donor 
sheet and a receptor sheet. Means for preventing the reacting of the two until 
intended (i.e., until activating pressure is applied) are also provided. This is typically 
accomplished by encapsulation of one of the reactants. Preferably, a fill solution of 
the color-forming compound(s) in a hydrophobic solvent is encapsulated or contained 
in microcapsules and is coated on the back side of one sheet of paper to form a donor 
sheet. This donor sheet is then mated with a receptor sheet coated with a developer 
or reactant for the color-forming compound. The microcapsules serve the purpose  
 
of isolating the reactants from one another and preventing reaction. Once activating 
pressure is applied to the uncoated surface of the donor sheet, such as from a stylus 
(such as a pencil or pen) or business-machine key (such as a typewriter or impact 
printer), the two substrates come into contact under sufficient pressure so that the 
capsules rupture (i.e., those capsules corresponding to the pattern of applied pressure) 
and the solution of encapsulated color-former is released and transferred from the 
donor sheet to the receptor sheet. On the receptor sheet, a reaction between the 
previously separated reactants occurs. Since the color-former and the developer form 
a deeply colored image when reacted, an image forms on the receptor sheet. In
