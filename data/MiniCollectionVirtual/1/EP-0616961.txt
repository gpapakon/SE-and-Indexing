<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a separating and aligning device (10) which receives differently sized articles (A, B) in any given sequence and position and which uses a multiplicity of webs (11, 12, 13) which are located side by side and each exhibit driven article-transporting rollers (20, 22, 23) having different speeds, the speeds being uniform over the length of the webs (11, 12, 13), but steadily increasing, in each web (11, 12, 13), to one side of the separating device in order to produce a lateral speed increase. The speed increase produces a separation and rotation of the articles (A, B) and this results in the fact that they are arranged in a single row along one side (40) of the surface of the separating device (10) and can thus be discharged onto a conveyor (15) at the end of the separating device (10), which conveyor (15) is remote from that end at which the articles (A, B) are received. One or more webs (11, 12, 13) comprise rollers having a tapering diameter (J, K), in order to render the lateral speed increase uniform.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for separating and aligning articles,
in particular cuboid objects, which are charged by a

charging conveyor (14) in a random arrangement and
alignment and are transferred to a delivery conveyor

(15) in a line one after the other, with an article-transporting
surface (rollers 20, 22, 23) by which the

articles are conveyed from the charging conveyor (14)
in the main direction of conveyance to the delivery

conveyor (15) and are conveyed simultaneously with
increasing speed laterally to the main direction of

conveyance in the direction of a guide element
(alignment belt 40), so that the articles are separated

from any adjacent articles by overtaking in the main
direction of conveyance and the article-transporting

surface (rollers 20, 22, 23) is limited on the side
having the higher lateral speed by the guide element

(alignment belt 40) running in the main direction of
conveyance and the separated articles are aligned,

characterised in that

the article-transporting surface (rollers 20, 22, 23)
is designed such that the articles, at least in

sections, are conveyed laterally to the main direction
of conveyance at a speed which increases linearly.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised
in that the article-transporting surfaces are designed

13) spaced apart from each other and arranged one

behind the other, viewed in the main direction of
conveyance, and the rollers (20, 22, 23) are conical in

order to produce an increase in the conveying speed
which runs laterally to the main direction of

conveyance. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the article-transporting surface

(rollers 20, 22, 23) is divided up into at least two
adjoining conveyor tracks (11, 12, 13) extending

adjacent to each other in the main direction of
conveyance, the conveying speeds of which increase

laterally to the main direction of conveyance.
An apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the conveying speeds of at least part of the

adjacent conveyor tracks (11, 12, 13) directed
laterally to the main direction of conveyance are

matched to one another such that the conveying speed
directed laterally to the main direction of conveyance

increases linearly over these conveyor tracks.
An apparatus according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that the conveyor tracks (11, 12, 13)

run straight.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the guide element (alignment belt

40) is aligned with its guide surface approximately at
right-angles to the article-transporting surface

(rollers 20, 22, 23).
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the guide element (alignment belt

40) can be driven at a speed which is at least as great
as the conveying speed of the adjoining article-transporting

surfaces (rollers 20, 22, 23).
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the guide element (alignment belt

40) opens into the delivery conveyor (15). 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the guide element is designed as

a belt conveyor with an endless revolving alignment
belt (40).
An apparatus according to Claim 9, characterised
in that a plurality of belt conveyors (alignment belt

40) are arranged one behind the other, viewed in the
main direction of conveyance.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 3 to 10,
characterised in that the rollers (20, 22, 23) of each

conveyor track (11, 12, 13) are in each case drivable
to a very great extent at the same speed and the speeds

increase in the direction of the guide element
