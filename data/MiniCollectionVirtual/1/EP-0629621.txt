<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-8-methoxy-7-(3-methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic
acid dihydrate as crystall form type I that is useful as
an antimicrobial agent and which has satisfactory stabilityThe official gazette of Japanese Patent Public
Disclosure (KOKAI) No. Hei 3-95177 discloses 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-8-methoxy-7-(3-methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic
acid (hereunder designated
"Q-35"). The official gazette further teaches that Q-35 is
the product of recrystallization from acetonitrile and that
it has satisfactory antimicrobial property.However, as continued research was undertaken to
commercialize it as a medicine, the Q-35 recrystallized
from acetonitrile turned out to have only low stability
due to the drawback that its weight would increase with
the increasing humidity. Under the circumstances, it was
impossible to administer the Q-35 in well-defined doses
and this, combined with other problems of the Q-35 made it
difficult to develop said compound as a medicine. Hence,
there was the need to develop a technique by which stable
Q-35 could be produced even under humid conditions. The present inventors conducted intensive studies
with a view to eliminating the above-described drawback of
the Q-35 recrystallized from acetonitrile. As a result,
they found that Q-35 had four crystal forms, a crystal with
a variable water content (which is hereunder referred to
as "crystal III" or "type III crystal"), a monohydrate
crystal (which is hereunder referred to as "crystal II" or
"type II crystal"), a dihydrate crystal (which is hereunder
referred to as "crystal I" or "type I crystal"), and an
anhydride crystal, and that the specific type of crystal
to be produced is determined by the type of solvent used
for recrystallization. As a result of the closer studies
conducted on the physical properties of the respective
crystal forms, the inventors found the following: the Q-35
recrystallized from acetonitrile was type III crystal;
type I crystal, namely, the dihydrate of Q-35, was the most
stable under humid conditions and, although it turned to
an anhydride under drying or heating conditions, it reverted
to the dihydrate when left to stand. The present invention
has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. Stated
briefly, the invention relates to a 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-l,4-dihydro-8-methoxy-7-(3-methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic
acid dihydrate as crystall form type I having the
following formula:
