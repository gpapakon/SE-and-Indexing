A drive system (10, 10A) for rotating a disk (22) includes a housing (28, 28A) having a planar element (12, 12A) with a working surface (14) which includes a spindle (18) which facilitates rotational movement of the disk (22) relative to the drive assembly. A plurality of orifices (23) extend through the planar element at an acute angle relative to the working surface (14) and are arranged in a circular array. A conduit assembly (26, 26A) delivers fluid to the housing (28, 28A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive 
system for storage media. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a fluid drive system for 
a disk-like storage medium. Magnetic and optical disks are highly 
popular for storing large quantities of information, 
for example, with personal computers. Magnetic disks 
come in various formats including 8 inch, 5-1/4 inch 
and 3-1/2 inch diameter. Disk drive systems retrieve 
information from and store information on the disks. 
These drive systems take on various forms depending 
upon the format of the disk. Both magnetic and 
optical disk drives use an electrical drive motor 
linked to a power supply via speed control circuitry. 
Also, the drive systems use some mechanical or 
physical device for coupling the storage medium to the 
drive motor to rotate the medium at a controlled 
velocity. The storage medium is rotated relative to a 
read/write head of the disk drive system. The 
read/write head retrieves information from and 
transfers information to the storage medium. Known data storage systems use drives that 
rotate the medium by engagement of the drive with the 
medium. A metal hub is used for engagement with 3-1/2 
inch diskette designs, while a spindle is used to 
engage a central aperture with hubless 5-1/4 inch 
designs. Thinner medium allows head designs to have 
improved head-to-medium contact by increasing the wrap 
around the head. Also, a fixed hub or contact spindle 
stiffens the medium near the inner data tracks and 
results in poorer head-to-medium contact at these 
tracks. This limits the useful area of the medium and  
 
makes it difficult to produce very small diameter 
media. Also, at higher speeds, as is well-known, the 
fixed hub flexible medium generates a concave profile 
as it is pulled toward the drive base. This 
complicates head-to-medium contact. The radial 
tolerances with the large fixed hubs become more 
significant as the data storage products use higher 
track densities. In the optical data storage product area a 
flat substrate is required and a thick caliper base 
must be used. A thinner caliper is preferred if it 
could be kept flat during use. The medium containers 
for magnetic and optical diskettes are relatively 
large and bulky due to housing one medium per 
container. For example, it takes a container that is 
0,3175 cm thick to store one diskette that is 0,00762 cm 
thick. A system is needed that will be able to 
store hundreds of 0,00762 cm thick media in one 
container for enhanced data storage. From
