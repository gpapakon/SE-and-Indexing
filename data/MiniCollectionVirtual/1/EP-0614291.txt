<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed the architecture for an all-optical network which 
employs a three level hierarchy using wavelength division multiplexing. At the 

lowest level of the hierarchy are Level-0 all-optical networks (36, 37, 38, 39). The 
Level-0 networks are "local" broadcast networks each of which supports a plurality 

of access ports and in which each access port can "hear" all the local traffic 
transmitted by all other access ports in the same Level-0 network. Each Level-0 

network shares wavelengths internally, but there is extensive reuse of wavelengths 

among different Level-0 networks. The next higher level (62, 64), which is the 
intermediate level, Level-1, is essentially a wavelength router coupled with one or 

more of the Level-0 networks to provide a wavelength path to one or more directly 
connected Level-0 networks or, in combination with a Level-2 network (80), a light 

path to one or more Level-0 networks outside itself. The Level-2 are second level 
wavelength routing networks which provide light paths, as opposed to wavelength 

paths, between Level-1 networks. The Level-2 networks may be as simple as fiber 
trunks alone or they may employ frequency changing devices in addition to 

wavelength routers and/or spatial switches.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical fiber transmission network and more 
specifically to a multilevel all-optical network architecture. Present day commercial lightwave transmission networks use optical 
fibers to carry large amounts of multiplexed information over long distances from a 
transmit terminal to a receive terminal. Most long-haul transmission lines and a 
substantial portion of short-haul transmission lines such as inter-office and intra-office 
links, local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and 
wide area network (WANs) are optical and, therefore, the information is carried over 
an optical fiber. A major advantage of transmitting information in optical form is the 
very large bandwidth and low losses associated with single mode optical fibers. In practice, at the transmitting end of an optical fiber, electrical signals 
representative of intelligence are transformed into optical signals for transmission 
along the optical fiber and, at the receiving end, are transformed back into electrical 
signals for further processing. Furthermore, in today's networks, the optical signals 
are converted to electrical signals, and back to optical, in order to use electronic 
switches to switch the various channels to their destinations, and/or to perform 
electronic regeneration in very long links. This optical-to-electronic conversion 
within the network restricts the users to pre-specified signaling formats. It also 
makes the continuous upgrading and enhancement of the networks costly and 
cumbersome. It is realized that with an all-optical network where optical signals can 
flow between users across the network without being converted to electronic signals 
within the network, the tens of terahertz of bandwidth available in optical fibers can 
be accessed in a more flexible and economic way. The benefits and advantages of 
being able to optically access the very broad bandwidth of optical fibers will permit a 
high-capacity, high speed network to be established for carrying data or information 
such as blueprints, words, music, medical and scientific images, movies, E-mail and 
the like from one location to another. Some fundamental requirements that an all-optical transmission network 
should satisfy to realize the attaihable benefits are as follows: First, the network 
must be universal in that it will accommodate an enormous diversity of applications, 
services, interfaces, protocols and signal formats. Second, it must be scalable in  
 
terms of the number of users, the
