 NUT RETAINING CLEAT FOR VEHICLE ENDLESS TRACKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field:The field of the invention is endless track assemblies for snow grooming vehicles, and more particularly the cleat assemblies thereof, including structures for fas¬ tening the cleats to the flexible plastic belting of such tracks.2. State of the Art:Snow groomer vehicles use endless tracks made up of flexible plastic belts made continuous by lacing their ends together. Actual lacing thread may be used, although lacing joint assemblies are more commonly employed, being a combin¬ ation of metallic hinge plates and an associated hinge pin. The snow grooming vehicle commonly has an endless track assembly on each of its sides, each comprising a number of fabric reinforced plastic belts. The belts are spaced apart to provide a broad base for the track while utilizing mini¬ mum amounts of belting. Steel cleat assemblies are bolted across the individual belts at intervals, tieing them to¬ gether into a track assembly. Each assemblied track is en¬ gaged by a power-transmitting sprocket wheel, which forces the belts to travel together around a set of guiding wheels called bogies. The powered belt imparts horizontal shear forces to the cleats, which engage the snow to propel the ve¬ hicle. Extensive development has gone into the design of the elongate cleat members, with the objectives of providing max¬ imum forward traction, along with substantial resistance to 

side slipping. Cleat constructions are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,765,731, 4,560,211, 4,281,882 and 4,059,315. Typically, the ground contacting cleat, also called a "grouser", is fastened to the outside of the flexible belting by bolts installed in matching holes in the grouser, the belt, and a metal backing plate on the inside of the belt. A large number of bolt and nut assemblies are required, so that cleat assembly is quite time consuming. Further, at least two assembly workers are required, because bolt heads and nuts, on opposite sides of the belts, cannot be reached simul¬ taneously by a single individual. The large number of bolt assemblies is required to exert the shearing forces against the belt holes, even though dimpled belt grabber plates may be employed between the grouser and the belt. See U.S. Patent No. 5r033r801. Not only is the initial assembly time con¬ suming, but cleat replacement is often necessary because of bolt or grouser failure. This is especially difficult in the field, and generally requires returning the vehicle to a main¬ tenance and

 1. A cleat to be assembled attached to the flexible belting of a vehicle endless track, the track comprising at least one endless flexible belt carrying longitudinally spaced sets of holes for mounting the cleat transversely to the belt, said cleat comprising: an elongate grouser plate having a generally planar belt contacting portion, having mounting holes therethrough matching the holes of one of the sets carried by the belt; an elongate backing plate having holes matching the mounting holes of the grouser; a mounting bolt operable through each of the matching holes to secure the backing plate, the belt, and the grouser together; a multifaced torque nut sized to be engaged by each mounting bolt; and an elongate member grasping a pair of opposed sides of each of the torque nuts, preventing rotation thereof with respect to said member, and holding said nuts spaced apart in matching relationship to the grouser mounting holes, the elongate member being installed along the belt contacting portion of the grouser. 

2_ The cleat of claim 1, wherein the rigid torque nut grasping member comprises: an elongate channel member having a web portion and a pair of spaced apart leg members, said web portion carrying bolt clearing holes therethrough, spaced apart in matching re¬ lationship to the associated set of cleat mounting holes of the backing plate, grouser and belt; a pair of opposed, inwardly projecting, dimples carried by the leg members of the channel at each bolt clearing hole; wherein each torque nut carries at least one pair of opposed parallel faces spaced apart to allow closely clearing insertion of the nut between the channel leg members, each face carrying a dimple-receiving depression, so that the nuts are retained within the channel in bolt-receiving positions.
3. The cleat of claim 1, wherein: the grouser plate is configured to include an open-ended, closed box portion.
