<ABSTRACT>
Handoff between coverage areas is achieved in a radiotelephone system coupled to standard wireline switches. Upon initiation of a radiotelephone call in one radio coverage area, a directory number and radio call identifier (203) are downloaded to the subscriber unit (101) from a fixed control unit (111) associated with the coverage area. When the subscriber unit determines a handoff to a target radio coverage area is desirable, it transmits the directory number and radio call identifier to another fixed control unit (113) associated with the target radio coverage area. This fixed control unit calls the directory number and is coupled to the first fixed control unit via the standard wireline switch (115, 117). The radio call identifier is then sent to the first fixed control unit to enable the proper connection for handoff.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "TRANSFERRING A RADIO TELEPHONE CALL*Background of the Invention:This invention relates to radiotelephone communication systems in general and more particularly to the method and apparatus of transferring a radiotelephone call by a subscriber unit from one radio coverage area to another radio coverage area.In radiotelephone systems having more than one radio coverage area, it is well known to coordinate the service provided in the radio coverage areas by enabling a radiotelephone call established in a first of the radio coverage areas to be maintained as the subscriber unit moves to a second radio coverage area. This transferring of the call service is conventionally known as handoff, handover, or link transfer.Cellular radiotelephone systems are known for their ability to maintain a telephone call over a wide geographic area by handing off a telephone call between radio coverage areas (or "cells"). Handoff techniques used in such cellular systems have been documented in the literature (see "Control Architecture" by Fluhr, et al., the Bell System Technical Journal Vol. 58, No. 1, Jan. 1979, pp. 43-69). Generally in handing off a call from one cell to another, it is necessary for the system to determine which cell has the best communication path to the subscriber unit and then instruct the subscriber unit as to which frequency it should tune in order to maintain the conversation into the new, target cell. More recently, the subscriber unit has been taking a more active role in the handoff decision-making process by providing information to the fixed network regarding which communication channels are suitable for continuing the call in a target cell (see, for example, United States Patent No. 5,127,100). 

 In the more recently developed systems in which the subscriber unit participates in the handoff determination, the fixed system equipment must smoothly and efficiently connect the telephone call from a target cell site to the call in progress. It has been suggested in Electronic Industries Association specificationIS-41 that the wireline telephone switch which initially receives and processes the radiotelephone call act as an anchor point for all future handoff activities. The anchor wireline telephone switch then connects the call to the radio subscriber unit, regardless of the subscriber unit's cell location. This plan, however, requires the wireline telephone switches to be specifically designed to handle wireless telephone services. Such use of wireline telephone switches is inefficient due to the

Claims:
1. A method of transferring a user message conveying radiotelephone call by a subscriber unit from a first radio coverage area, served by a first fixed control unit which is coupled to a wireline telephone switch, to a second radio coverage area served by a second fixed control unit, comprising the steps of: transmitting a directory number, associated with the first fixed control unit and the wireline telephone switch, from the first fixed control unit to the subscriber unit; storing said transmitted directory number at the subscriber unit; transmitting said stored directory number from the subscriber unit to the second fixed control unit when a need for transfer of the radiotelephone call to the second fixed control unit from the first fixed control unit is determined; calling said subscriber unit transmitted directory number from the second fixed control unit; and connecting the second fixed control unit call to the first fixed control unit via the wireline telephone switch whereby the user messages from the second fixed control unit are coupled to the first fixed control unit when the radiotelephone call has been transferred to the second fixed control unit.
2. A method in accordance with the method of claim 1 wherein said step of transmitting a directory number from the first fixed control unit to the subscriber unit further comprises the step of transmitting said directory number in response to an initiation of the radiotelephone call in the first coverage area.
3. A method in accordance with the method of claim 1 wherein said step of transmitting said stored directory number from the subscriber unit further comprises the step of measuring by the subscriber unit a radio signal quality in the second radio coverage 


area whereby said need for transfer of the radiotelephone call is determined.
4. A method in accordance with the method of claim 1 further comprising the step of transmitting radio call control information from the first fixed control unit to the subscriber unit.
5. A method in accordance with the method of claim 4 further comprising the steps of storing said transmitted radio call control information at the subscriber unit and transmitting said stored radio call control information from the subscriber unit to the second fixed control unit when a need for transfer of the radiotelephone call to the second fixed control unit from the first fixed control unit is determined.
6. A method in accordance with the method of claim 5 wherein said step of connecting the second fixed control unit to the first fixed control unit further comprises the step of coupling said subscriber unit transmitted radio call control information to the first fixed control unit.
7. A radiotelephone system having at least two radio coverage areas and employing a wireline telephone switch to couple radiotelephone calls to the wireline telephone network, the radiotelephone system having the capability of handoff of a subscriber unit radiotelephone call from a first radio coverage area to a second radio coverage area, and comprising: a first fixed control unit coupled to the wireline telephone switch and associated with the first radio coverage area, said first fixed control unit having means for providing a directory number associated with the first fixed control unit and the wireline telephone switch to the subscriber unit; a second fixed control unit, associated with the second radio coverage area, said second fixed control unit having: 


 means for accepting a first message, including said directory number, from the subscriber unit for initiation of a handoff, means for placing a call to said directory number, and means for coupling a second message to said first fixed control unit via the wireline telephone switch.
8. A radiotelephone system in accordance with claim 7 further comprising means for initiating a radiotelephone call between the subscriber unit and the first fixed control unit and wherein said means for providing a directory number to the subscriber unit further comprises means for transmitting said directory number to the subscriber unit in response to said radiotelephone call initiation.
9. A radiotelephone system in accordance with claim 7 wherein said first fixed control unit further comprises means for transmitting radio call control information to the subscriber unit.
10. A radiotelephone system in accordance with claim 9 wherein said means for accepting a first message further comprises means for accepting said radio call control information and wherein said second fixed control unit further comprises means for coupling said radio call control information to the first fixed control unit.
