<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus 
that can rapidly and accurately sort genuine from 

counterfeit coins without using a special high-performance 
CPU. 
The invention relates to a method of sorting genuine 
and counterfeit coins that are passing through a 

predetermined pathway, wherein a plurality of type-identifying 
means 14 and 15 is arranged along the 

predetermined pathway along which a plurality of types of 
coins M to be sorted are passing. This method of sorting 

genuine and counterfeit coins comprises the steps of: 
setting a plurality of mutually non-overlapping assumed 

domains 1 to 4, one for each of identification factors of 
the type-identifying means and corresponding to magnitudes 

of values thereof; determining whether an output from any 
of the type-identifying means belongs in any of the 

plurality of assumed domains; and sorting whether or not 
outputs from the identification means belong within a 

closed function domain in coordinates of a plurality of 
dimensions with axes along which the identification factors 

are plotted, in order to sort in accordance with each of 
identification factors of the plurality of types. 
The invention also relates to an apparatus for sorting 
genuine and counterfeit coins that are passing through a 

predetermined pathway, wherein a plurality of type-identifying 
means 14 and 15 is arranged along the 

predetermined pathway along which a plurality of types of 
coins M to be sorted are passing. This apparatus for 

sorting genuine and counterfeit coins comprises: an assumed 
region setting means for setting a plurality of mutually 

non-overlapping assumed domains, one for each of 
identification contents of the type-identifying means and 

corresponding to magnitudes of values thereof; a sorting 
means for determining whether an output from any of the 

type-identifying means belongs in any of the plurality of 
assumed domains; a function domain setting means for  

 
setting a closed function domain in coordinates of a 

plurality of dimensions with axes along which the 
identification factors are plotted, in order to sort in 

accordance with each of identification factors of the 
plurality of types; and a sorting means for sorting whether 

or not outputs from the identification means belong within 
the closed function domains; wherein genuine and 

counterfeit coins are sorted by an output from the sorting 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for electronically sorting genuine and counterfeit coins. Existing patents such as German Patent No. 2,646,025 
and European Patent No. 0,367,921 disclose techniques of 
obtaining the characteristics of a coin as two-dimensional 
and three-dimensional coordinates, then sorting genuine 
from counterfeit coins by determining whether or not they 
belong in a predetermined domain that is defined by these 
coordinates. If the coins to be sorted are of a single type, the 
sorting of genuine from counterfeit coins can be performed 
simply and accurately by such a genuine/counterfeit coin 
sorting apparatus. However, automatic vending machines have recently 
become expected to handle at least two types of coin, in 
order to cope with differing types of product and products 
of higher prices, and thus it is not uncommon in foreign 
countries for such machines to have to handle six to eight 
types of coin. When many different types of coin are handled in such 
a manner, they are sorted by setting a predetermined 
coordinate domain for each type of coin. This makes the 
details of the sorting more complicated, and a fair amount 
of time is required for the sorting. One example of a prior art technique for handling many 
types of coins is disclosed in US Patent No. 5,078,252, in 
which an embodiment thereof can handle four types of coin. 
This apparatus is configured in such a manner that inserted 
coins to be detected are tested in a testing section, 
measured values that represent characteristics of those 
coins are extracted therefrom, genuine and counterfeit 
coins are sorted according to those measured values, and  
 
then the coins are guided into either a money path or a 
return path by mechanical director means, on the basis of 
the sorting results. This apparatus must be able to sort genuine coins from 
counterfeit ones within, for example, 20 milliseconds, in 
order to be able to measure the coins to be detected then 
guide them into the appropriate money or return path. If 
this time is exceeded, coins that have been sorted as 
genuine could be guided into the return path. A high-performance CPU is necessary for shortening the 
sorting time, but there are price limits. EP-A-0 219 574 discloses a method for the identification 
of coins, based on the analysis of the frequency spectrum 
of acoustical signals produced by the vibration of 
a coin due to its collision with a surface. The groups 
of frequencies for the coins having legal tender in a

A method of sorting genuine and counterfeit coins (M) 
that are passing through a predetermined pathway (13), wherein 

a plurality of type-identifying means (14,15) are arranged along 
said predetermined pathway (13) along which a plurality of types 

of coins to be sorted are passing, the method 
comprising the steps of: 


setting a plurality of mutually non-overlapping assumed 
domains (0-a, a-b, b-c, c-d), one for each of identification factors of said 

type-identifying means and corresponding to magnitudes of 
values thereof; 
determining (S13) whether an output (P
y
) from any of said type-identifying 
means belongs in any of said plurality of 

assumed domains in order to distinguish between coin types; and on the basis thereof 
sorting (S14) whether or not outputs (P
x
, P
y
) from said type-identifying 
means belong within a closed function domain in coordinates 

of a plurality of dimensions with axes along which said 
identification factors are plotted, in order to sort in 

accordance with each of identification factors of said 
plurality of types.

symmetrical shape function.
