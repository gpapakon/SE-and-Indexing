<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a microelement assembly and, in 
particular, relates to one such microelement assembly having means, integrally formed in 
each of two substrates, for kinematically interfacing the substrates to each other. As used herein the phrase "microelement" , and all idiomatic variations thereof,is 
taken to include any and all optical or electronic elements having features that are formed 
by other than known industrial machining techniques. Currently, when two or more substrates having microelements thereon are to be 
assembled, the alignment of the substrates prior to final attachment thereof is quite 
tedious and subject to considerable human error. For example, typically when substrates 
containing two microelectronic circuits are to be assembled to each other, alignment 
fiducials are provided on each substrate at some point during the manufacturing 
processing of those circuits. In many cases, the fiducials are aligned using an infrared 
microscope and, once aligned, the circuits are subsequently affixed to each other. One 
particular application of the microelements under discussion is the alignment and 
attachment of a substrate having electronic signal processing circuitry thereon to a 
substrate having a multi-element detector array thereon. Further, when two or more 
substrates having optical microelements thereon are to be aligned, for example, when a 
lenslet array is to be aligned with another substrate having optical microelements, such as 
an array of laser diodes, similar alignment techniques are used. However, in the case of 
substrates having optical microelement alignment, the alignment can nonetheless be 
performed by use of a microscope, however the party performing the alignment usually 
has to actually look through one of the optical microelement substrates to align the 
fiducials. Similar techniques are used when a substrate having optical microelements and 
a substrate having an electronic microelement are to be aligned with each other, such as 
in the case of disposing a lenslet array over a detector array. The alignment schemes described above have a number of drawbacks. 
Specifically, the initial alignment is clearly subject to human error. Further, since the  
 
substrates must usually be retained in position until one or more steps are performed to 
affix the substrates to each other, an operator is required to maintain the alignment over a 
period of time. Such a requirement is also subject to not only the usual visual human 
error but is
