<ABSTRACT>
Automatic interlingual translation system which 
comprises analysis of the sentences of a source-language 

text in order to impart to them the corresponding 
morphological, syntactical and semantic characteristics, 

carrying out a first transfer of the analysed text to an 
intermediate language, integrating, by means of a 

universal motor of conversion of the language, the 
previously transferred sentences in order to express them 

in an interlingua possessing all the morphological, 
syntactical and semantic features of the languages to be 

translated, carrying out a second transfer of the source-language 
sentences to sentences in a second intermediate 

language already possessing all the structural 
characteristics of the target language, converting the 

sentences of the target language in an interlingua into 
sentences in a target language with its specific 

vocabulary and, in order to conclude the translation, 
extracting the structural analyses of the sentences in 

the target language. The invention is applicable to the 
automatic translation of texts, to database management 

and to voice recognition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic
multilingual translation system of advanced design based
on the interlingual approach and which makes it possible
to optimise translation from an original/source text into
various destination languages on the basis of a single
analysis, the characteristics of the interlingual
approach guaranteeing easy integration into the system of
languages which are not related typologically, between
which it would not be possible to guarantee a projection
of linguistic information without an in-depth analysis of
the content or semantic information of the message. As
examples of remotely related languages may be mentioned
Castillian (Spanish) and Basque.In its investigations and in the development of
its products for Natural Language Processing (PLN), this
invention adopts a "multilingual global approach", since
the world around us is multilingual. During its development,
the invention considered the most widely spoken
languages, but gave special attention and took special
care to develop valid systems which permit extensions to
all languages.The production of automatic translations has been
and continues to be the subject of a number of research
and development projects, since considerable economic and
technological importance is given to the possibility of
automatically producing a translation from certain
languages into others with minimum human intervention,
based almost exclusively on handling the relevant
translation equipment and on effecting minor corrections
in order to reflect certain nuances, contained in the
original text, in the translated text which the
translation machine has not been capable of rendering. As
an example of the economic importance of translation,
mention should be made of the large quantity of texts
(leaflets, articles, instruction manuals, etc.) which are
produced throughout the world and the majority of which 
have to be translated into different languages. Another
example is the considerable amount of its budget that the
European Community allocates to translation production.
The automation of translation in these and other cases
which may be mentioned would undoubtedly have great
economic significance, given the ensuing reduction in
costs.Some automatic translation systems which have
already been developed are based on the transfer of a
text in a source language to an intermediate language and
from the latter to the translated text in a target
language, the intermediate language representing a
synthesis of morphological, syntactical and

<CLAIMS>
Automatic interlingual translation system which
permits the translation of a text in a source language

into different target languages, based on a single
analysis of said text, as well as the easy integration of

languages which are not related typologically, between
which it would not be possible to guarantee a projection

of linguistic information without an in-depth analysis of
the content or semantic information of the text to be

translated, in which system use is made of logic tools
for automatic interpretation of natural languages and

artificial languages or for programming, and logic tools
for assisting in translation, said system comprising the stages of :


a) analysing the sentences of the source-language
text, conferring on them the corresponding morphological,

syntactical and semantic characteristics by means of an
arborescent-type clarification;
b) carrying out a first transfer of the analysed
text to a first bridge language in which the abstract

representation of the source-language sentences is
preserved with their characteristics analysed but

translated into the first bridge language
which contains all the typical aspects of the source

language;
c) through a universal conversion motor of the
language, integrating the previously transferred

sentences into an interlingua possessing all the
morphological, syntactical and semantic features of the

languages to be translated, so that said sentences are
surrounded by the universal characteristics of all the

languages involved in the process of the translation;
d) carrying out a second transfer of the source-language
sentences, screened via the first transfer and

the integration into the interlingua, to sentences in a
second bridge language possessing the structural

characteristics of the target language, supplied by the
interlingua, but which are formally represented by the second

bridge language; 
e) converting the sentences in the source
language, screened via the first transfer, the

interlingua and the second transfer into target-language
sentences with their specific vocabulary; and
f) in order to conclude translation of the
sentences into the desired target language, extracting

the structural analyses from the sentences.
System according to Claim 1, characterised in
that:


in stage a), the relationship of the personal and
the situational, the subcategorisation of the conceptual

and referential elements, the relative position of the
determinant element and the determinate element, all the

actors, such as emitter, receiver, agent, patient, etc., and the
circumstances participating in the action are determined,

to which end use is made of the grammar peculiar to the
source language and of a specific dictionary thereof;
in stage b), use is made of a bilingual
dictionary and pre-established rules of transfer are

applied in order to transform the sentences in the source
language into the first bridge language which retains all

the original features of said sentences, which constitute
a small part of the universal characteristics integrated

in the interlingua;
in stage c), an in-depth transformation of the
sentences of the source language in the first bridge

language into sentences of the target language in the
second bridge language is performed, the structure of the

source language used as point of departure for the
translation being maintained in the interlingua and the

sentences being integrated into an area provided with the

universal features of the languages;
in stage d), use is made of a bilingual
dictionary and pre-established rules of transfer are

applied in order to transform the interlingual sentences
into sentences which already possess the features

peculiar to the target language; and
in stage e), use is made of the grammar peculiar 
to the target language and a specific dictionary thereof

in order to translate formally the component elements of
the different sentences.
System according to either of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that stages b), e) and d) described

above run virtually simultaneously.
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the translation process is

reversible so that the text translated into a target
language can be again converted into the starting text in

the source language.
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the universal motor of conversion

of the language consists in a circuit incorporating a
memory.
Use of the system according to any one of Claims
1 to 5, in interactive database management from various

different languages to the original language and in the
multilingual diffusion of databases written originally in

a specific language.
Use of the system according to any one of Claims
1 to 5, in voice-recognition systems in order to assist

the linguistic interpretation of said systems improving
quality in the recognition of the voice and in order to

perform automatic simultaneous translation between one
original language and several selected languages.
Use of the system according to any one of Claims
1 to 5, in instrument and machine interfaces such as

flight simulators, digitally-controlled machines, robots
and home electronics systems.
