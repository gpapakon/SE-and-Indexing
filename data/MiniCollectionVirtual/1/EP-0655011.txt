<ABSTRACT>
A toy vehicle includes a supporting chassis (12) having a plurality of rolling wheels (13, 14, 15, 16) secured thereto. The chassis supports an audio circuit (61), a battery (62) and an audio transducer (60) together with a pair of switch contacts (52, 53) configured to provide a growling sound when the switch contacts touch. The chassis further supports an articulated body (11) having a cab portion (30) and rear portion (31) resembling a standard truck joined in a pivotal attachment. A shaft (40) and cam (51) mechanism is coupled to a movable arm (43) in a cooperative arrangement in which pivotal motion of the movable arm closes the switch contacts activating the audio circuit and raising the cab (30) and rear portion of the truck body to expose sets of hidden teeth (22, 23) at the front of the toy vehicle.

 TOY VEHICLE HAVING GROWLING ACTIONSPECIFICATIONCross Reference to Related ApplicationThis application is related to a copending application filed August 15, 1992 in the name of Keith Hippely, Gary Swisher and Terrance Choy and entitled TOY VEHICLE HAVING ARTICULATED JAWS which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to toy vehicles and particularly to those having sound producing action.Background of the InventionMiniature toy vehicles which replicate actual full- sized vehicles with some level of authenticity have been well known in the art for many years. Another type of toy vehicle emerging more recently provides a fanciful or exaggerated appearance rather than an accurate or closely accurate appearance. Within this type of fanciful toy vehicle have been found vehicles which assume animal-like appearance, robotic or futuristic appearances, as well as vehicles which are formed of a plurality of interconnected components which facilitate the configuration of the toy vehicle into two or more dramatically different appearances.For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,655,727 issued to Swisher et al sets forth a TOY VEHICLE in which a base 

portion, a top portion and a mechanical arrangement linking the base and top portions is provided. The mechanical linkage permits the top portion to move between several different positions with respect to the base portion thereby providing different appearance characteristics for the vehicle.U.S. Patent No. 4,568,307 issued to Gabler et al sets forth a PUSH TOY VEHICLE WITH OPERABLE MOUTH in which a toy vehicle includes a plurality of rolling wheels and an articulated jaw portion supported in a pivotal attachment to the forward portion of the vehicle. Operable means are provided which rotate in response to the rotational motion of the vehicle supporting wheels to provide operation of the pivotally mounted mouth or jaw portion. Thus, as the toy vehicle is rolled across a play surface, the mouth portion is operated.U.S. Patent No. 4,248,006 issued to Jones et al sets forth a RECONFIGURABLE MOVING ANIMAL SIMULATING TOY in which an upper body section and lower body section are operatively attachable in a plurality of configurations. A compressible bellows and a nozzle are operatively connected to a liquid container within the upper body section. The bellows may be depressed to expel liquid from the upper body portion.U.S. Patent No. 4,424,978 issued to Kassai sets forth a VEHICLE FOR CHILDREN in which a chassis and body

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A toy vehicle comprising:
a chassis having a plurality of supporting wheels;
sound producing means;
a body having a cab portion, a rear portion, and a pivotal attachment therebetween;
pivot means coupled to said rear portion and said chassis for pivoting said rear portion relative to said chassis and raising said cab portion; and
switch means actuated by said pivot means for activating said sound producing means when said rear portion is pivoted;
said cab portion undergoing pivotal motion with respect to said rear portion as it is raised due to said pivotal attachment.
2. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 1 wherein said pivot means includes:
a rear arm extending from said rear portion;
a shaft coupled to said rear portion and to said arm rotatable therewith;
a switch having an actuator; and
a cam disposed upon said shaft operating said actuator as said shaft is rotated in a first direction in which said rear portion is raised. 


 3. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 2 wherein said cab portion defines a first plurality of downwardly extending simulated teeth and wherein said chassis includes means for hiding said first plurality of simulated teeth when said cab portion is not raised.
4. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 3 wherein said chassis includes a second plurality of simulated teeth extending upwardly into said cab portion and visible solely when said cab portion is raised.
5. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 4 wherein said pivotal attachment includes a hinge generally centered with respect to said cab portion and said rear portion.
6. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 5 wherein said cab portion and said rear portion define a front to back axis of symmetry and wherein said hinge includes a tab extending forwardly from said rear portion along said axis of symmetry having an aperture therein and a pin coupled to said cab portion and passing through said aperture.
7. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 4 wherein said pivotal attachment includes a hinge positioned proximate one side of said cab portion and said rear portion whereby said cab portion pivots with respect to said rear portion about an offset front-to-back axis.
8. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 7 wherein said hinge includes a pair of axially aligned front-to-back bores defined in said cab portion and said rear portion and a hinge pin received within said bores.
9. A toy vehicle as set forth in claim 8 wherein said pivot means includes: 


 a forward arm coupled to said shaft pivotable therewith and having a coupling opening at the forward end thereof; and
a coupling member attached to said cab portion and cooperating with said opening;
said coupling member being offset to the opposite side of said cab portion from that of said hinge.
