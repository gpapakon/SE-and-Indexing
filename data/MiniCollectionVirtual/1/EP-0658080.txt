<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for placing a component on an elongate, strip-shaped 
support which is provided with indexing holes and with a repetitive pattern, the 

positions of the patterns relative to indexing holes situated near an imaging device and 
positioned by means of pins being determined by means of this imaging device, after 

which the positions of the patterns relative to a component placement device are 
calculated, and subsequently a component is placed on a pattern in a desired position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of placing a component on a strip-shaped
support which is provided with indexing holes and with a pattern which extends
over a region corresponding to a series of indexing holes with a pitch S, the position of
the pattern in relation to the indexing holes being determined by means of a imaging
device, after which the strip-shaped support is transported by means of pins inserted
into the indexing holes to a component placement device where subsequently a
component is placed in a desired position on the pattern.The invention also relates to a device for placing a component on a strip-shaped
support.Such a method and device are known from the brochure "Fast Component
Mounter" from Philips Electronics N.V., June 1993. Here a printed circuit board (the
support) is aligned by means of positioning pins inserted into indexing holes of the
printed circuit board, and the position of a pattern on the board relative to the indexing
holes is determined by means of an imaging device. Then the board is displaced to a
component placement device by means of the positioning pins. In the component
placement device, an electronic component is placed on the pattern of the board in the
desired position. Subsequently the printed circuit board is displaced to a different
position in the component placement device or to a position in which the board is
removed from the component placement device.A number of problems as described below occur especially when the
device is used for placing components on a comparatively long, strip-shaped support, a
portion of the support being situated below the imaging device while another portion of
the support is situated in the component placement device, and the distance between the
imaging device and the component placement device is comparatively great (for
example, 2 m).Although the indexing holes are provided accurately in the strip-shaped
support, a comparatively small tolerance in the pitch between every two adjacent
indexing holes will lead to a comparatively great error given the number of pitch 
distances over the comparatively great distance between the imaging device and the
component placement device. In addition, these tolerances in the pitch will have the
effect that the strip-shaped support will not optimally fit all pins, in spite of the fact that
the pins are usually constructed so as to be self-locating. If the strip-shaped support is
forced onto the pins, this will lead to fracture or creasing of the strip-shaped support, as
a result of

<CLAIMS>
A method of placing components on a strip-shaped flexible support (3) which
is transported intermittently through a component placement device (1), said support being

provided with indexing holes (39) with a pitch (S) and a plurality of circuit pattern, each
pattern lying in a region in which a series of indexing holes are located and which

support comprises at least one mark (87) situated in said region, said mark having a known
relative position with respect to its corresponding pattern, said components being placed

on the circuit pattern by means of a placement head (43),

said method comprising the following steps:

a) positioning a part of the support having a first pattern with respect to an
image device by means of positioning pins (35) which are inserted in indexing

holes,
b) making an image of the mark belonging to the first pattern with the image
device,
c) transporting the support by means of transporting pins (37) inserted into the indexing holes over a defined distance such that, seeing in a
transport direction, a next part of the support having a second pattern is

situated underneath the image device,
d) making an image of the mark belonging to the second pattern with the
image device,
e) withdrawing the positioning pins from the indexing holes,
f) transporting the positioning pins back to said next part of the support,
while leaving the support in situ,
g) positioning said next part of the support having the second pattern with
respect to the image device by inserting the positioning pins in the

indexing holes,
h) making an image of the mark belonging to the second pattern with the
image device,
i) calculating the position of the first pattern with respect to the placement
head and calculating the relative position of the first pattern with respect

to the second pattern from the data of the images.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the position of the first pattern
relative to the second pattern is determined for different positions in relation to the

image device, after which an average relative position is calculated.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the support is tautened in the
transport direction.
A device (1) for placing components on a strip-shaped flexible support (3) which
is provided with indexing holes (39) with a pitch (S) and a plurality of circuit pattern, which

device is provided with an image device (27), a component placement head (43) for placing
components on the support, and a transport device (29) for transporting the strip-shaped

support in a transport direction, which transport device is provided with a transport
beam (33) having positioning pins (35) cooperating with the indexing holes of the support for

positioning the support relative to the image device, said transport beam being further
provided with transport pins (37) cooperating with the indexing holes of the support for

transporting the support in the transport direction, said transport pins being movable in
the transport direction relative to the positioning pins, said transport beam having means (81,83,73)

for moving the transport pins to tauten the support in the transport direction.
A device as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the means for moving the
transport pins to tauten the support comprises a carrier block on which the transport

pins are secured, said carrier block being movable along the transport beam by
pneumatic means.
A device as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the device is provided with
clamping mechanism for tautening the support in a direction transverse to the transport

direction.
