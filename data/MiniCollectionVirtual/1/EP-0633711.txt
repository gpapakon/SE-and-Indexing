<ABSTRACT>
A current supplied to a discharge lamp (100) is an A.C. current having a predetermined frequency from an inverter circuit 
(70), and its power control is carried out by changing the current setting (setting signal) of a chopper circuit (40) constituting a 

constant current circuit. In other words, when a value is set by an output luminance regulator (120), this set current value is inputted 
to a chopper control circuit (130). The chopper control circuit (130) checks the current detected by a current detector (110) and 

outputs a current control signal to a gate terminal (41) of the chopper circuit (40) so that the output current may coincide with the 
set current value. Accordingly, the power supplied from the inverter circuit (70) to the discharge lamp (100) is controlled by the 

chopper circuit (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power regulator for 
regulating a discharge lamp and executing a dimmer control, 
and also to a variable color illuminating apparatus using 
the regulator. Alternating current is required to energize a discharge 
lamp, and a conventional discharge lamp regulator with a 
dimmer circuit for regulating a discharge lamp and executing 
a dimmer control is disclosed, for example, JAPANESE PATENT 
LAID-OPEN GAZETTE No. H-2-197093. The discharge lamp regulator converts an alternating current 
obtained from a commercial ac power source to a direct 
current with a rectifier and transmits the direct current to 
a full-bridge inverter circuit while inputting an ac control 
signal to a gate terminal of the inverter circuit. The 
inverter circuit then converts the direct current to a 
square-wave alternating current, which is supplied to energize 
the discharge lamp. The discharge lamp regulator further includes a dimmer 
control circuit for outputting the ac control signal to the  
 
gate terminal of the inverter circuit. The control circuit 
superposes off-times on the on/of operation of the inverter 
circuit according to luminance reduction of the lamp, thereby 
substantially executing the dimmer control through the frequency 
regulation. Since the dimmer controller executes the frequency regulation, 
luminance reduction often causes a long off-time in which no 
power is supplied to the discharge lamp, and further causes 
undesirable turn-out of the discharge lamp. In other words, the conventional dimmer controller can not 
stably reduce the luminance of the discharge lamp and has a 
very narrow dimmer-operation range. Moreover, since the dimmer control circuit has a circuit 
structure to generate the ac control signal for executing 
the on/off operation and superposing the quiescent time 
during the on-off operation, the control circuit has a 
rather complicated and cost-consuming structure. There is a known technique of controlling the luminance of 
fluorescent lamps or other similar discharge lamps at a 
relatively high frequency with an inverter circuit. This 
technique is, however, not applicable to the control of high 
illuminance discharge lamps such as metal halide lamps at a 
constant high frequency because it causes the resonance of 
the lamps which may result in unintentional turn-out of the 
lamps.  The metal halide lamps can be regulated stably only at 
frequencies of a restricted range, and the dimmer control 
through the frequency regulation is accordingly
