<ABSTRACT>
The electric lamp has a light source (1) which has an envelope (3) of 
doped quartz glass. The quartz glass comprises silicon, cerium, titanium, europium and 

aluminium in oxidic form. Cerium accounts for 0.1-0.2, titanium for 0.01-0.04, 
europium for 0.03-0.2 and aluminium for at most 0.8 at% of the cationogenous 

elements. The aluminium/europium atomic ratio lies in the region from 3 to 8. The 
doped quartz glass is at least substantially transparent to visible radiation and at least 

substantially impervious to UV radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric lamp provided with 
a light-transmitting lamp vessel and 
a light source in said 
light-transmitting lamp vessel which is closed in a vacuumtight manner, wherein the light 
source has an envelope of light-transmitting, UV-absorbing quartz glass which contains 
aluminium in oxidic form and a metal in oxidic form chosen from a group to which 
cerium and titanium belong. A high-pressure discharge lamp of this kind is known from US 3,531,677. The known lamp has a quartz glass lamp vessel which has a layer of 
doped quartz glass at its outer surface. The doping in this case consists of a coloured, 
possibly UV-absorbing oxide or of cerium oxide or titanium oxide as a colourless, UV-absorbing 
substance. A disadvantage of the known lamp is that the lamp is impervious 
to only a portion of the UV spectrum and, dependent on the doping, also transmits only 
a portion of the light generated by the light source. NL 77 14 305 discloses a high-pressure discharge lamp whose quartz 
glass lamp vessel consists of UV-absorbing doped quartz glass in chosen locations, for 
example, quartz glass with 0.02 mole% of each of the element europium, cerium, and 
titanium. The doped quartz glass here is present only in those locations of the lamp 
vessel where the latter, depending on the position which it occupies during operation, 
would have a comparatively low temperature without a dopant. Owing to the doping, 
UV is absorbed and the temperature in situ increases, which benefits the luminous 
efficacy of the lamp. The doped quartz glass, however, has a yellow colour so that it 
does not transmit all the generated light. Moreover, it does not absorb all UV radiation. US 4,361,779 discloses an electric lamp, a halogen incandescent lamp and 
a high-pressure discharge lamp, whose quartz glass lamp vessel has a doping of alkali 
oxide, alkaline earth oxide, rare earth oxide such as praseodymium oxide, possibly with 
aluminium oxide or europium oxide. The lamp vessel is strongly yellow-coloured and as  
 
a result is suitable for use in lamps, for example halogen lamps, which are to emit 
yellow light. The glass is closed to only a portion of the UV spectrum. An electric incandescent lamp and a high-pressure discharge lamp with a 
doped quartz glass lamp vessel or with an outer envelope of such a glass are known 
from US 5,196,759. The doping here consists of titanium oxide and cerium oxide and 
has the object of absorbing a portion of the UV radiation. Among the wavelengths
