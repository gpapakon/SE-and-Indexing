<ABSTRACT>
A method for alkylation of aromatic compounds while optimizing the life of the catalyst used comprises controlling the amount of alkylation agent in the reaction mixture such that the aromatic compound is always in an excess, preferably at least 99:1 excess of aromatic, more preferably at least 999:1 excess of aromatic. The alkylation agent may be introduced intermittently, or in stages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of 
alkylating aromatic compounds which maximizes the life 
of the alkylation catalyst. In conventional alkylation processes, the aromatic 
hydrocarbons and the alkylating agent are usually added 
in a single stage with a slight excess of aromatic to 
alkylating agent, e.g., in a range between about 2:1 to 
20:1, to reduce the formation of the undesirable heavy 
products. However, lower excesses of aromatic have 
been favored because too much excess aromatic was 
believed to result in less monoalkylation product, 
e.g., as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,400,570 to 
Butler, et al. However, it has also been proposed, 
e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 4,761,513 to STEACY, to 
proportionally add the alkylating agent to the aromatic 
hydrocarbon at the intermediate inlets of reaction 
zones to result in a molar ratio of aromatic 
hydrocarbon to alkylating agent in the range of 1:1 to 
about 50:1 in the feed to the reaction zones and to 
fulfill the quenching requirements for the process. Solid acid catalysts typically are used to 
catalyze the alkylation of aromatic compounds. One major problem that has been encountered when 
alkylating aromatics using solid acid catalysts is 
rapid deactivation of the catalyst. A cause of such 
deactivation appears to lie in the alkylation mechanism 
itself, wherein carbonium ions are formed from the 
alkylation agent and the acid catalyst during the first 
step of the alkylation reaction. In the next stage of 
the reaction some of the carbonium ions are added to 
the aromatic ring to finish the alkylation process, 
while other carbonium ions react with the remaining 
alkylation agent to produce high molecular weight 
compounds which, in turn, can alkylate aromatics  
 
resulting in even heavier compounds. The high molecular weight compounds 
are undesirable because they may deactivate the catalyst by permanently 
blocking the acidic sites which catalyze the alkylation reaction. A number of methods have been tried to overcome the problem of 
deactivation of acid catalysts during the alkylation of aromatics. For 
example, others have tried: increasing or decreasing the particle size of the 
catalyst; multiple reaction beds for serial use after deactivation of the 
catalyst; recycling of the mono- or di- alkylation product back to the initial 
reaction mixture; and, co-feeding steam along with the aromatic and the 
alkylating agent. EP-A-0 433 932 employs a new catalyst comprising an acidic 
mordenite zeolite having a silica/alumina molar
