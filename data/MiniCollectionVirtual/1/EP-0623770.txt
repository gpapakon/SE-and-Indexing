<ABSTRACT>
Plastic ball valve, with a spherical shut-off 
member (15) which is provided with a passage and is 

rotatably accommodated in a cylindrical inner housing (5), 
and is coupled to a jack (8). The inner housing (5) is 

accommodated in a cylindrical outer housing provided with 
two connection sockets (1). The shut-off member (15) is 

retained in the inner housing (5) by two annular retaining 
parts (10) lying on either side of the shut-off member. 

Each retaining part is provided with one or more radially 
projecting and resilient hook ribs (12) which are 

accommodated in a peripheral groove (11) formed on the 
inside, and near one end of the inner housing. The outer 

housing consists of an essentially cylindrical intermediate 
housing (14) to which an end flange (4) of a cylindrical 

connection socket (1) is fixed on either side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic ball 
valve, comprising an essentially spherical shut-off member 
which is provided with a passage and is rotatably 
accommodated in an essentially cylindrical inner housing, 
and is coupled to a jack, which inner housing is 
accommodated in an essentially cylindrical outer housing 
provided with two connection sockets. Such a ball valve is known from Dutch Patent 
Application No. 9000772. This ball valve, which is made of 
plastic parts, has a spherical shut-off member which is 
provided with a passage, and which is accommodated in an 
inner housing, the inside wall of which at one end forms an 
accomodation for a sealing ring which rests against the 
shut-off member. The inner housing is shut off at the other 
end by a retaining part, the inside wall of which also 
forms an accomodation for a sealing ring which rests 
against the shut-off member. The inner housing also has an 
outward facing guide lying at right angles to the passage, 
for accommodating a jack which is coupled to the shut-off 
member. The shut-off member, the inner housing and the 
retaining part are accommodated in an outer housing which 
is made of plastic and is also provided with a guide part 
for the jack, and which merges at one side into a moulded-on 
connection socket in which an accomodation is formed on 
the inside for a sealing ring which seals the outer housing 
locally relative to the inner housing. The outer housing is 
shut off at the other end by a second connection socket 
which is welded to the outer housing, and which has an 
accomodation on the inside wall for a sealing ring which 
connects to the outside of a cylindrical end socket of the 
retaining part which is snapped into the inner housing. A disadvantage of the above-described design is 
that very complex, and thus also very expensive, moulds are 
necessary for the manufacture of the outer housing and the 
inner housing. Another disadvantage of such a design is  
 
that for the manufacture of another ball valve of the same 
type with a different passage a new shut-off member, inner 
housing, retaining part, connection socket and a new outer 
housing have to be manufactured using other moulds, which 
requires considerable capital investment. The object of the invention is to overcome the 
abovementioned drawbacks by providing a ball valve of the 
type mentioned in the preamble, making it possible to 
manufacture ball valves with different passages from a 
number of standard parts, where the parts can be 
manufactured

<CLAIMS>
Plastic ball valve, comprising an essentially 
spherical shut-off member (15) which is provided with a 

passage and is rotatably accommodated in an essentially 
cylindrical inner housing (5), and is coupled to a jack 

(8), which inner housing is accommodated in an essentially 
cylindrical outer housing provided with two connection 

sockets (1), characterized in that the shut-off member (15) 
is retained in the inner housing (5) by two annular 

retaining parts (10) lying on either side of the shut-off 
member, each retaining part (10) being provided with one or 

more radially projecting and resilient hook ribs (12) which 
are accommodated in a peripheral groove (11) formed on the 

inside, and near one end of the inner housing (5). 
Ball valve according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the inner housing (5) is an essentially symmetrical 

shape relative to the central transverse plane thereof. 
Ball valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 

in that the two retaining parts (10) are identical. 
Ball valve according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the inner housing (5) is provided with an 

inward projecting cylindrical guide wall (25) situated at 
right angles to the passage and having a rib (26) projecting 

radially inwards for supporting and fixing the jack 
(8). 
Ball valve according to any of claims 1 - 4, 
characterized in that the outer housing consists of an 

essentially cylindrical intermediate housing (14) to which 
an end flange (4) of a cylindrical connection socket (1) is 

fixed on either side. 
Ball valve according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the intermediate housing (14) is an essentially 

symmetrical shape relative to the central transverse plane 
thereof. 
Ball valve according to claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the retaining part (10) is provided with a 

cylindrical end socket (2) surrounded by a sealing ring (3) 
 

which rests against the inside of the connection socket 
(1), essentially in the plane of the end flange (4) 

thereof, for sealing off the outer housing relative to the 
retaining part. 
Ball valve according to any of claims 1 - 7, 
characterized in that the spherical shut-off member (15) 

has on the outside two flat portions lying parallel to the 
passage, a polygonal recess being provided in one flat 

portion for the accommodation of a complementarily shaped 
end of a jack (8). 
Ball valve according to any of claims 1 - 8, 
characterized in that the jack (8) is provided with a 

channel (34) opening out in the two ends of the jack.
