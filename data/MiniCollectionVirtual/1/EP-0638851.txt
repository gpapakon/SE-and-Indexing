<ABSTRACT>
A tearable sealing member for unsealably 
sealing an opening of a developer container for 

containing a developer for an image forming apparatus 
includes a seal film for closing the opening; a 

flexible tape extending along a surface of the seal 
film; wherein the seal film has an average density of 

not less than 0.65 g/cc and not more than 0.9 g/cc, 
measured under JIS K6758; wherein the seal film is 

torn and the opening is opened by pulling the flexible 
tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tearable
sealing member, a developing apparatus and a process
cartridge.There are known various image forming
machines of electrophotographic type such as a small
machines including printer for information apparatus
such as computer, CAD or the like, or facsimile
machine, and a large size machine such as
electrostatic copying machine or the like for office
use. In either of them, a developer is accommodated
through one method or another, and the image forming
operation is carried out using the developer.In an example of such a printer, it is usable
with a detachably mountable process cartridge. Once
the process cartridge is mounted, the developer is
supplied to a developing sleeve and then to a
photosensitive drum gradually by operating developer
stirring device from a developer container in the
cartridge, until the developer contained therein is
used up.As regards a developer container for a
copying machine or the like, there are a replenishing
type container and a stationary container. In the 
former type, the developer container is built in the
main assembly of the copying machine, and the
container is filled with at once by the total capacity
of the container, and in the latter, the developer
container is mounted in the main assembly of the
copying machine, and it is maintained stationary
therein in which the developer is gradually supplied
to the developing device by operating the developer
stirring means as in the process cartridge, until the
developer is used up.In any case, in order to prevent leakage of
the developer during transportation or during non-use
period, the opening for the supply of the developer is
provided with a sealing member. In the case of the
process cartridge or the stationary type container, a
peeling member is used.In this case, a sealing member in the form of
a film or tape is bonded to cover the opening of the
cartridge or the stationary type container. When the
developer is to be supplied into the main assembly,
the sealing member is pulled out externally to open
the developer container, thus permitting the developer
accommodated in the container to flow into the main
assembly through the opening. The peeling member may be an easy peel film type or
a tearable sealing member type. US-A-5177540 describes
a tearable sealing member comprising a sheet having a
preferential tearing direction, wherein the sheet is
extended to form a tear strip, and the sealing member is
adhered to a container body round an opening therein, and
the adhesion
