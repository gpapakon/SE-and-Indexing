<ABSTRACT>
Improved relay which consists of a carcass (1) fitted with a lower closure base (2), while, within the assembly, there is a mechanism consisting of an electromagnet (5) and of a metal part (6) which is arranged in a tilting mounting on a respective support part (7), the said part (7) being fixed by the part (15) constituting the core of the electromagnet (5), while the tilting part (6) is drawn back, by means of a spring (8) arranged on this part and on a respective base part (9), in which the body (10), provided for the corresponding coil (11) of the electromagnet (5) is defined as a unit.

<CLAIMS>
Relay constituted by a recipient casing (1) provided with a base for closure
(2), inside which is included a mechanism formed by an electromagnet (5) and a

metallic piece (6) disposed for pivoting assembly, said piece (6) being attracted
rearwardly, by means of a spring (8) which is incorporated between it and the

base piece (9) of the mechanism, while, in the base piece (9) mentioned, is
unitarily defined the body (10) for the coil (11) of the electromagnet;

   characterized in that the pivoting metal piece (6) is disposed for pivoting
assembly on a support piece (7), in which it fits by a transverse shaft (14) fast

therewith, and in that the spring (8) for rear attraction of the pivoting piece (6) is
in an inwardly incined arrangement from the hooking on the piece (6) mentioned,

up to the fixation on the base piece (9), which promotes positioning of the
transverse shaft (19) in its housing, ensuring that the points of contact between

the "U" piece (15) constituting the core of the electro-magnet and the mobile
piece (6) are always the same.
Relay according to the first Claim, characterized in that, for the outer
connection of the coil (11) of the electromagnet, terminals are incorporated,

constituted by respective metal rods (24) which are fitted firmly in the base piece
(9) of the inner mechanism, projecting through the closure base (2) and on which

are wound and welded, outside, the respective ends, likewise projecting, of the
conducting wire (25) of the coil.
Relay according to the first Claim, characterized in that the support piece
(7) of the pivoting metal piece (6) is fixed by the fitting, in this piece (7), of the

piece (15) constituting the core of the electromagnet, shaped in the form of a "U",
said pieces (7, 15) establishing a clip for retention together in the fit mentioned,

by means of respective, corresponding, reciprocal formations (22, 23) which 
determine, while ensuring an absolute immobility of the piece (15) mentioned of

the core in its assembly.
Relay according to the first Claim, characterized in that the shaft (19) of
the pivoting metal piece (6) is joined by welding to said piece, preferably by

laser, with the result that the dimensional precision of the assembly is determined
by the use of welding.
Relay according to the first Claim, characterized in that, according to a
preferred embodiment, the closure base (2) presents a wall for fit in the casing (1)

containing the functional mechanism, said wall of the base and the very wall of
the casing defining reciprocal formations for the formation of a clip fixing the

assembly; while the base piece (9) of the inner functional mechanism in turn
defines reciprocal formations (12, 13) for fixing clip with respect to the

mentioned wall of the base, and projecting flanges (14) for support in said wall,
on which the casing establishes retention in the assembly.
