<ABSTRACT>
A set of cold metal section bars (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6) has 
been developed that can be converted into thermally-broken 

section bars (10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60) wherein each section bar 
comprises an element of internal metal section bar (7) and an 

element of external metal section bar (8) connected together by 
means of connecting walls (9) comprising deformable teeth (11) 

and removable strips (12); the elements of internal and 
external section bar (7, 8) are provided with longitudinal 

recesses (18) suitable for housing insulating bars (29) and the 
element of external section bar (8) comprises at least one 

abutment fin (21) connected to a connecting tang (23) 
protruding outward, so as to form a chamber (19) for aeration 

and for collection of water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a set of cold metal 
section bars which are convertible into thermally-broken 
section bars suitable for cold door and window frames and for 
thermally-broken (insulated) door and window frames. During the course of the present description and of the 
claims, the expression "cold section bars" is used to indicate 
section bars that are not thermally insulated while the 
expression "thermally-broken section bars" stands for thermally 
insulated section bars. Various kinds of section bars are currently on the market: 
a) so called cold or whole section bars, constituted by section 
bars made wholly of metal, without thermal insulation; b) so called whole section bars with a thermal screen, 
constituted by section bars made wholly of metal to which 
insulating elements are applied, generally in plastic, on 
the external part of the frame, so as to form a barrier to 
the exchange of heat; c) thermally-broken or insulated section bars, comprising 
insulating elements interposed between elements of external 
and internal metal section bars. Thermally-broken section bars, in turn, can be of different 
type. One type of thermally-broken section bar is obtained from 
two metal section bars, one internal and the other external, 
extruded separately, that are joined together by means of hars 
of insulating material inserted in specially-provided seats and  
 
then clamped through a rolling process. These thermally-broken section bars have several drawbacks. Tolerances and parallelisms between the two internal and 
external elements are difficult to obtain and to check, as they 
are section bars extruded separately, thus, easily, 
imperfections occur in joining the two elements together. Moreover, the two internal and external elements can have a 
non-uniform anodization and their aging can also be 
non-uniform. Another type of thermally-broken section bar is obtained 
from a whole metal section bar provided with a tubular casing 
that connects the elements of the internal and external metal 
section bars, extruded in one single piece. During the 
production step of the section bars, polyurethane foam is 
injected into the tubular casing and the metal walls of the 
tubular casing connecting the elements of internal and external 
metal section bars are then removed, by means of a cutting 
operation, so that the two internal and external elements 
remain connected together only through the injected 
polyurethane foam. This thermally-broken section bar does not have the 
drawbacks of

Set of cold (i.e. not thermally insulated) metal section bars (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6) which 
are convertible into thermally-broken (i.e. thermally insulated) section bars (10; 20; 30; 

40; 50; 60), particularly for door and window frames, each 
comprising an element of internal metal section bar (7) and an 

element of external metal section bar (8) connected together by 
means of connecting walls (9), characterized in that 


said connecting walls (9) are made of metal and comprise 
teeth (11) linked to said elements of internal and external 

section bars (7, 8) by means of weakening lines (14) suitable 
for making them deformable, and strips (12) connected to said 

deformable teeth (11) by means of further weakening lines (13) 
suitable for making them removable, the thickness of said 

strips (12) being less than the thickness of said teeth (11), 
said elements of internal and external section bars (7, 8) 
are provided with longitudinal recesses (18) each formed by one 

of said deformable teeth (11), by at least one rigid ridge (15) 
substantially parallel to said teeth (11) and by a back wall 

(16) connecting one tooth (11) and one ridge (15), and 
said element of external section bar (8) comprises at least 
one abutment fin (21) connected to at least one of said back 

walls (16) by means of a connecting tang (23) protruding 
outward, so as to form a chamber (19) for aeration and for 

collection of water in the proximity of said fin (21) and to 
minimize the transmission of deformations from said teeth (11) 

to said fin (21). 
Set of section bars according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said element of internal section bar (7) is provided 

with at least two longitudinal recesses (18) arranged at a 
distance greater than that at which two corresponding  

 
longitudinal recesses (18) of the element of external section 

bar (8) are arranged and said removable strips (12) are 
inclined with respect to said back wall (16), converging toward 

said element of external section bar (8), so as to carry any

so that deformations of said teeth (11) involve only variations 
in the curvature of the fin (21).
