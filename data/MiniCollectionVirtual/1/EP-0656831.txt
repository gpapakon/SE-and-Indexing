<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coated cookware. More particularly, it relates to such
cookware with a scratch-resistant non-stick coating.It has long been desirable to provide cookware with non-stick coatings which are
resistant to scratching. Prior efforts have included using harder auxiliary heat resistant
resins along with the perfluorocarbon polymer resins such as polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) and copolymers such a tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, known as
fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP), or perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer (PFA) with
tetrafluoroethylene. Although various pigments and fillers including mica and colloidal
silica have been used, both in cookware and industrial coatings, ideal scratch-resistant
cookware coatings have not been achieved.US-A-4,180,609 discloses an article bearing a basecoat
derived from a composition comprising (a) a particulate
polymer polymerized or copolymerized from monomers selected
from one or more monoethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon
monomers and hydrocarbon ether monomers, said monomers being
completely substituted with fluorine atoms or a combination of
fluorine atoms and chlorine atoms; (b) mica particles, mica
particles coated with pigment, or metal flake; and (c) a
liquid carrier, which basecoat is overlaid with a topcoat
finish derived from a composition comprising (a), (b) and (c),
with the concentration of (b) in the topcoat being from 10% to
90% of the concentration of (b) in the basecoat.The present invention provides an article of cookware comprising a metal
substrate coated with a scratch-resistant non-stick coating system wherein said coating
system comprises a primer applied to a metal substrate, a midcoat adhered to said primer
and a topcoat adhered to said midcoat,
said primer comprising 15 to 35 percent by weight calcined aluminum
oxide in the form of particles with an average diameter under 20 µm, 35 to
70 percent by weight perfluorocarbon polymer composition comprising 50 to 70 percent by weight 
polytetrafluoroethylene and 50 to 30 percent by weight copolymer selected from
fluorinated ethylene-propylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer with
tetrafluroethylene, and 15 to 30 weight percent auxillary heat stable polymer
selected from polyamide-imide, polyphenylene sulfide and polyether sulfone,said midcoat comprising 10 to 20 percent by weight of such aluminum
oxide, and 90 to 80 percent by weight of such perfluorocarbon polymer composition but in a ratio in
the range of 80 to 90 percent by weight
