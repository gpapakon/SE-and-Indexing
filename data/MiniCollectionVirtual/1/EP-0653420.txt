<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an aromatic peroxycarboxylic acid comprising 
reacting an aromatic aldehyde and oxygen in the presence of at least one 

oxide of transition metal selected from
 

chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper in a solvent is 
provided.

 
According to this invention, aromatic peroxycarboxylic acids can safely 

and easily be obtained in high yield without causing decomposition of 
the products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an aromatic
peroxycarboxylic acid by aerobic oxidation of an aromatic aldehyde.Aromatic peroxycarboxylic acids are important oxidizing agents used for
various reactions such as epoxidation of olefins, oxidation of ketones
to esters or lactones, phenols to p-quinones, and sulfides to
sulfoxides. Heretofore, as a process for producing aromatic
peroxycarboxylic acids, there has been known a process in which an
aromatic aldehyde is oxidized by oxygen in the presence of a catalyst.
As the catalysts for this process, homogeneous catalysts such as
conjugated imines (Japanese Patent Publication(kokai) Shou 55-43058), and
cobalt halides (Japanese Patent Publication(kokai) Hei 1-117859)
have been proposed.However, this process has a problem that the yield of aromatic
peroxycarboxylic acids is low when conjugated imines are used as a
catalyst. On the other hand, when a homogeneous catalyst such as a
cobalt halide is used, a serious safety problem that a decomposition
reaction of the produced aromatic peroxycarboxylic acids by the used
catalyst simultaneously takes place, which might cause an explosion is
raised, although the aromatic preoxycarboxylic acids may be obtained in
good yield,.
Consequently, the processes mentioned above are not satisfactory for
industrial scale production.
SU-288 748 discloses perbenzoic acid, useful as an initiator and oxidiser for the
production of olefins alpha-oxides.
It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a catalyst which provides aromatic peroxycarboxylic acids effectively by
aerobic oxidation of the corresponding aldehydes and does not decompose
the produced peroxycarboxylic acids. This object was achieved on the basis
of the finding that by
using heterogeneous transition metal oxides as a catalyst, the desired
aromatic peroxycarboxylic acids are safely and easily obtained in a
high yield without causing decomposition of the products.Thus, the present invention provides a process for producing an
aromatic peroxycarboxylic acid which comprises reacting an aromatic
aldehyde with oxygen in the presence of at least one oxide of a
transition metal selected from chromium,
manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper in a solvent at a temperature
in the range of 20 to 50°C.In the present invention, as the aromatic aldehydes used as starting
material, benzaldehyde, o-tolualdehyde, m-tolualdehyde, p-tolualdehyde,
p-ethylbenzaldehyde, p-isopropylbenzaldehyde, p-tert-butylbenzaldehyde,
2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde,
