<ABSTRACT>
A detection system for detecting and/or 
verifying the magnetic properties of the magnetic ink 

layer in Federal Reserve Notes or other documents 
includes, in order of interaction with the magnetic ink 

of a Note, a saturation record head, a saturation read 
head, a non-saturation record head, and a non-saturation 

read head. The disclosed method of 
operation is equivalent to the normal testing of the 

magnetic layer of a Note, but eliminates the need for 
an erase magnet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the
detection of magnetic fields and, more particularly to
the detection of and/or verification of the magnetic
fields associated with Federal Reserve Note currency
such as it is, for example, known from US-A-4 587 412.
Federal Reserve Notes are printed, in part, with a
magnetic ink which provides each Note with a detectable
magnetic layer.In the related art, the magnetic field
detection system used for the detection and
verification of Federal Reserve Note currency uses a
5-head process shown in Fig. 1. A Federal Reserve Note
11 is transported in a direction shown by the Arrow in
Fig. 1. The Note 11 first encounters a high frequency
erase head 15. The high frequency erase head 15
demagnetizes the magnetic ink on the Federal Reserve
Note. Next the Note 11 is passed over a non-saturation
record head 16 where the Note 11 is exposed to a field
that magnetizes the ink to approximately 80% of
saturation. The Note is next passed over
non-saturation read head 17, the non-saturation read
head detecting a remanent moment resulting from the
application of the non-saturation magnetic field. The
Note 11 is next passed over a saturation record head 18
which provides a field which magnetizes the magnetic
ink layer to saturation. Finally, the Note 11 is
passed over a saturation read head 19 which detects the
saturation remanence moment resulting from application
of the saturation magnetic field. The operation of the
prior art testing method can be understood by reference
to Fig. 2. Fig. 2 is a plot of the magnetization of 
the material versus the magnetic field, commonly called
the hysteresis loop. The Note 11 first has an erase
field applied thereto which results in the magnetic
layer having the magnetic properties identified by
point 21 of Fig. 2. When a non-saturation (80%)
magnetic field is applied to the Note 11, the magnetic
layer has the properties associated with a point 22
relative to the hysteresis curve 20. When the Note 11
is moved from the vicinity of the non-saturation
magnetic field head, the magnetic properties (remanence
moment) assume the properties defined by point 23.
This remanence moment defined by point 23 is measured
by the non-saturation magnetic field read head 17.
Note 11 is then subjected to a saturation magnetic
field and the field in the magnetic layer is shown by
point 24 of Fig. 2. Once removed from the saturation
magnetic field record head 18, the remanence
magnetization at point 25 is measured by the saturation
magnetic field read head 19. The
