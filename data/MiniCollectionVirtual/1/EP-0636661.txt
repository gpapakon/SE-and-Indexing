<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide resin 
composition, in particular to a melt-processable composition 
and more particularly relates to an aromatic polyimide resin 
composition. The invention further relates to a polyimide 
copolymer and to a polyimide based composition containing the 
resin composition or copolymer. Conventionally, polyimide has been excellent in mechanical strengths 
and dimensional stability in addition to its high heat resistance and 
also outstanding in flame retardance and electrical insulation. 
Consequently, polyimide has been used in the field of electric and 
electronic appliances, space and aeronautic equipment and transport 
machinery and is expected in future for wide use in the field where 
heat resistance is required. Polyimide of various kinds which exhibit 
excellent characteristics has conventionally been developed. However, 
such polyimide has no distinct glass transition temperature though 
outstanding in heat resistance and thus must be processed by such means 
as sintering in order to use as a molding material. On the other hand, 
polyimide which has excellent processability is insufficient in heat and 
solvent resistances because of a low glass transition temperature and 
solubility in halogenated hydrocarbon solvents. Consequently, advantages and drawbacks have been simultaneously 
found in conventional polyimide. With the extended application of polyimide to various fields of use, 
it has been strongly desired to develop polyimide which can satisfy  
 
various kinds of performance. In particular, in the above industrial field, it has been desired to 
develop a polyimide having excellent dynamic repeated fatigue 
characteristic in addition to the above inherent excellent properties 
of polyimides as an industrial material instead of a metal, for 
mechanical parts, automobile parts, for example, parts for internal 
combustion engine such as impeller of centrifugal compressor, turbo-charger, 
parts for silencer and exhaust system such as manifold, and 
valve-guide, valve-system, piston, skirt, oil pan and the like. In order to meet such demands, the present inventors have previously 
found melt-processable polyimide which is excellent in mechanical and 
electrical properties and outstanding heat and chemical resistances, 
and had recurring structural units of the formula (1) : 
 
wherein X is a radical selected from the group consisting of a direct 
bond, isopropylidene, hexafluoroisopropylidene, carbonyl, thio and 
sulfonyl, and R is a tetravalent
