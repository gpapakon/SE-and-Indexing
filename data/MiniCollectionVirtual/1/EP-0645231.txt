<ABSTRACT>
an extruder in which the joint between the downstream, 
forward end portion of a cylinder (2) and a gear pump (8) is always 

kept tight, so that molten resin material is prevented from 
leaking out. As the main discharge port of a diverter valve (9) is 

prevented from shifting from the inhalation port of the gear 
pump (8) at the joint therebetween, the flow passage at the joint 

is always smooth without a spot where the molten resin material 
collects. The quality of resin products thus becomes stable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extruder of the type as defined in the precharacterizing
portion of claim 1. An extruder of this conventional type is disclosed in a company catalog
published in 1993. Furthermore, said conventional extruder is shown in Figures 7 and 8 of
the present specification.From US-A-4310251 there is known an apparatus for continuously processing thermal
plastic material comprising a mixer and an extruder. Said mixer and said extruder are
transversely related and the extruder has its barrel and its motor mounted by supports
which are supported by a carriage having wheels riding on tracks. Furthermore,
JP-A-025228921 discloses a bi-axial extruder having two screws rotatably fitted to two
parallel extending bores. Said bi-axial extruder as well as the succeeding devices are
installed on the same floor.Fig. 7 and 8 are a top and a side view of a
conventional resin material extruder in which the direction of
the flow passage of a gear pump is set perpendicular to that of
the flow passage of a cylinder.More specifically, the upstream end portion of a
cylinder 2 having built-in screws is coupled to a speed reducer
1 to which a motor 5 is coupled and a gear pump 8 is coupled
via a diverter valve 9 to the downstream, forward end of the
cylinder 2 in a direction perpendicular to the flow passage of
the cylinder 2. Further, a screen unit 7 and a granulating
unit 6 are successively coupled to the gear pump 8. The speed
reducer 1 is securely positioned.The upstream end portion of she cylinder 2 is securely
coupled to the speed reducer 1. The cylinder 2 is also movably
supported with respective supports 4 at two places on both 
sides thereof in the longitudinal direction. The diverter
valve 9 is securely coupled to the forward delivery opening of
the cylinder 2.The main discharge port of the diverter valve 9 is
opened toward one side of the cylinder 2.The gear pump 8, the screen unit 7 and the granulating
unit 6 are coupled together successively and securely. The
screen unit 7 is movably supported with respective supports 4'
on both sides thereof in the direction of the flow passage,
that is, in the direction perpendicular to the flow passage of
the cylinder 2. The inhalation port of the gear pump 8 is
securely coupled to the main discharge port of the diverter
valve 9.The inhalation port of the gear pump 8 and the main
discharge port of the diverter valve 9 are coupled together
under the cooling condition in such a way that, in
consideration of the thermal expansion of the cylinder 2 at
