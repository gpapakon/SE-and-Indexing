<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses an assemblable table comprising at 
least one table top (2), locked through junction means (3) 

to a supporting leg (4) composed by two or more supporting 
elements (41) easily united to one another through connecting 

means (5), whereby each connecting means comprises a 
first connecting body (51) which is inserted into each 

element (41) and a second connecting body (151) which is 
connected with the first connecting body (51) through a 

junction body (251) which stably locks together the elements 
(41) which compose the leg (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an assemblable table.It is a known fact that in the furniture field some assemblable
tables are sometimes realized, that consist of a
plurality of parts which can be taken apart.Tables thus realized are known above all in the furniture
field for garden, camping, bar, restaurants and similar,
where it is necessary to have tables which can be easily
taken apart and assembled in case of need, so as to make
their transport easier and so that they can be easily
stored without taking up much space.In the realizations belonging to the known technique the
elements composing the table are connected to one another
by means of screws and nuts which are tightened and untightened
by means of wrenches, screwdrivers or similar.The assemblable tables obtained according to such realizations
present therefore a first inconvenience in that in
order to assemble them or take them apart, it is necessary
to have available some tools such as wrenches, screwdrivers
or similar which are not always within reach of the operator.Another inconvenience besides this one is that said screws
and said nuts are objects of small dimensions and can be
easily lost.Not the last inconvenience is that said screws and said
nuts, in order to be easily accessible for the operations
of assembling or taking apart the tables, are positioned so
as to be seen and, therefore, when the assembly has been
completed, they can be seen, thus damaging the aesthetic of
the table once it has been put together, especially if they
become rusty.US-A-3 934 519,
the source of the preamble of claim 1,
discloses a core structure assembly and
a process of assembly of at least two tubes, where each tube
is provided with a toungue or lug projecting from the
exterior of the tube and engaging in openings formed in theperiphery of an assembly core formed in two parts connected
each other by a screw.It is with the purpose of obviating such inconveniences
that the assemblable table being the object of the present
invention is realized.In particular, the main purpose of the invention is to 
obtain an assemblable table in which the elements composing
it are easily put together without using any screws.It is another purpose that the assemblable table according
to the invention can be assembled and taken apart without
using any tools.It is not the last purpose that the elements which connect
the parts composing the table are not visible once the
assembly of the table has been completed.The described purposes are achieved by an assemblable table as
defined in

<CLAIMS>
An assemblable table comprising at least one table
top (2), removably attached through junction means (3) to

at least one underlying supporting leg (4), said leg being
composed by two or more supporting elements (41) removably

and easily united to one another through connecting means
(5), 
comprising a first connecting body (51) and a second
connecting body (151), the coupling of said first and

second connecting bodies causing the stable connection of
said supporting elements (41), 
characterized
in
that
 said
first connecting body (51) is provided with projections

(52) which are inserted with snap into slits (42) made in
each of said elements (41) composing said leg (4), and in

which said second connecting body (151) is provided with
indentations (155) suited to lodge the corresponding ribs

(45) belonging to the same elements (41), said first connecting
body (51) and said second connecting body (151)

being connected to each other by means of a junction body
(251)
.
An assemblable table according to claim 1, characterized
in that said junction body (251)

consists of a tubular sleeve (252) provided with outer
hooking means (255, 256), suited to stably bind it with a

snap into a through hole (153) drilled in said second
connecting body (151) and an inner thread (253), suited to

stably bind it with a tubular body (53), provided with an
outer thread (54), belonging to said first connecting body

(51).
An assemblable table according to claim 2, characterized
in that said outer hooking means consist of an

annular area having a depressed diameter (256), made on the
outer essentially central part of said tubular sleeve

(252), suited to realize a contrasting undercut (255), a
radial notch (259) being obtained in one of the edges of

said junction body suited to make it elastically yelding. 
An assemblable table according to claim 3, characterized
in that the end of said edge of said junction body

(251) presents a tapered area (258).
An assemblable table according to claim 4, characterized
in that said junction body (251) presents a ring

nut (257) which can be tightened and is arranged at the end
opposite to said tapered area (258).
