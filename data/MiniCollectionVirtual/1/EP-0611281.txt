<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides improvements in supercritical fluid extraction of particulate egg substrates by forming the substrate into porous solid particles characterized by a number weighted mean particles size ranging from about 0.5 millimeters to about 3 millimeters and by a tapped bulk density of from about 0.2 to about 0.5 grams per milliliter prior to subjecting the substrate to extraction under supercritical conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved supercritical fluid
extraction process. Specifically, the process provides improved methods for
extraction of solutes from powdered egg substrates wherein the high costs of
supercritical fluid extraction are reduced by increasing the flow rate of the
supercritical fluid through the substrate, without sacrifice of solute mass
transfer.Supercritical fluid extraction is a very attractive process for
removing either valuable or unwanted components from a wide variety of
substrates. Supercritical fluid extraction is desirable because it leaves no
solvent residues in either the substrate or the extract, does not create "still-bottoms"
or stack emissions and is friendly to the environment.Supercritical fluid extraction is rarely practiced on a large
commercial scale with the decaffeination of coffees and teas, the extraction of
hops essence and some other flavor extractions as notable exceptions. The
major obstacle to large scale supercritical fluid extraction processes is the
relatively high cost of those processes which is due in part to low solubility of
many target solutes in common supercritical fluids, prohibitive capital
expenses and the protracted time which is required for the extraction to be
accomplished.The extraction time is dependent on the solubility of the solute,
transfer of the solvent into the particle of substrate, transfer of the solute-laden
solvent out of the substrate particle, and the flow rate at which the
supercritical fluid can be pumped through the bed of substrate. Powdered 
materials in particular are subject to variable extraction rates in supercritical
fluid extraction processes because powdered substrates tend to suffer from
channelling and compaction of the substrate particles such as against the
discharge plate of the supercritical fluid extraction pressure vessel.Of interest to the present application is the process by which egg
solids including egg yolk are processed by spray drying to produce a dried
powder which can be further processed or can be reconstituted in the
production of food products. Spray dried egg particles are characterized by
mean particle sizes of about 0.1 millimeters, a relatively low degree of
porosity and a relatively high bulk density. Such spray dried particles tend to
suffer from compaction and channelling and provide resistance to fluid flow
during supercritical fluid extraction. Such a process is e.g. disclosed in JP 59140299In WO 93 14649, a state of the art according to Art
54 (3) EPC, a process for
