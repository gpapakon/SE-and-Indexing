<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel lipid compositions that facilitate
the intracellular delivery of biologically active (therapeutic) molecules. The
present invention relates also to pharmaceutical compositions that comprise
such lipid compositions, and that are useful to deliver therapeutically
effective amounts of biologically active molecules into the cells of patients.Effective therapeutic use of many types of biologically active molecules
has not been achieved simply because methods are not available to cause
delivery of therapeutically effective amounts of such substances into the
particular cells of a patient for which treatment therewith would provide
therapeutic benefit. Efficient delivery of therapeutically sufficient amounts of
such molecules into cells has often proved difficult, if not impossible, since,
for example, the cell membrane presents a selectively-permeable barrier.
Additionally, even when biologically active molecules successfully enter
targeted cells, they may be degraded directly in the cell cytoplasm or even
transported to structures in the the cell, such as lysosomal compartments,
specialized for degradative processes. Thus both the nature of substances that
are allowed to enter cells, and the amounts thereof that ultimately arrive at
targeted locations within cells, at which they can provide therapeutic benefit,
are strictly limited. Although such selectivity is generally necessary in order that proper
cell function can be maintained, it comes with the disadvantage that many
therapeutically valuable substances (or therapeutically effective amounts
thereof) are excluded. Additionally, the complex structure, behavior, and
environment presented by an intact tissue that is targeted for intracellular
delivery of biologically active molecules often interfere with such delivery, in
comparison with the case presented by populations of cells cultured in vitroExamples of biologically active molecules for which effective targeting
to a patients' tissues is often not achieved include: (1) numerous proteins
including immunoglobin proteins, (2) polynucleotides such as genomic DNA,
cDNA, or mRNA (3) antisense polynucleotides; and (4) many low molecular
weight compounds, whether synthetic or naturally occurring, such as the
peptide hormones and antibiotics.One of the fundamental challenges now facing medical practicioners is
that although the defective genes that are associated with numerous inherited
diseases (or that represent disease risk factors, including for various cancers)
have
