<DESCRIPTION>
 HETE OAROMATIC 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR AGONISTSThe present invention relates to a class of substituted five-membered heteroaro atic compounds possessing an imino spacer group. These compounds act on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, being selective agonists of so-called "5-HTι-like" receptors. They are therefore useful in the treatment of clinical conditions for which a selective agonist of these receptors is indicated.5-HTι-like receptor agonists which exhibit selective vasoconstrictor activity have recently been described as being of use in the treatment of migraine (see, for example, A. Doenicke et_al. , The Lancet. 1988, Vol. 1, 1309-11) . The compounds of the present invention, being selective 5-HTι-like receptor agonists, are accordingly of particular use in the treatment of migraine and associated conditions, e.g. cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, headache associated with vascular disorders, tension headache and paediatric migraine.The present invention provides a compound of formula I, or a salt or prodrug thereof:( l) wherein the broken circle represents two non-adjacent double bonds in any position in the five-membered ring; 

 W, X, Y and Z independently represent oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen or carbon, provided that one of , X, Y and Z represents oxygen or sulphur and at least one of , X, Y and Z represents carbon;A represents hydrogen, hydrocarbon, a heterocyclic group, halogen, cyano, trifluoromethyl, -0RX, -SRX, -NRXRV, -NRxC0Ry, -NRxC02Ry, -NRxSC>2Ry, or -NRzCTNRxRV;E represents a bond or a straight or branched alkylene chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;F represents a group of formulaU represents nitrogen or C-R2;B represents oxygen, sulphur or N-R3;R1 represents -CH2. CHR4.NR6R7 or a group of formulain which the broken line represents an optional chemical bond; 

 R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 independently represent hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl;Rx and Ry independently represent hydrogen, hydrocarbon or a heterocyclic group, or Rx and R together represent a C2-6 alkylene group;Rz represents hydrogen, hydrocarbon or a heterocyclic group;T represents oxygen, sulphur or a group of formula =N.G; and G represents hydrocarbon, a heterocyclic group or an electron-withdrawing group.For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of formula I will be non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically
