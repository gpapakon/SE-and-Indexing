<ABSTRACT>
A programmable infusion pump (10) can be configured to operate in one of several operational modes (i.e. BASAL, PCA, BASAL and PCA, etc.). The pump (10) is provided with an erasable, preferably non-volatile memory (34) for holding information designating one of the modes. The end user can set up the pump (10) easily and expeditiously for the designated mode, since the other, non-designated modes are made invisible.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INFUSION PUMP CONFIGURATION SCHEME USING EEPROMSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a. Field of InventionThis invention pertains to a microprocessor- controlled infusion pump which is field programmable to a desired configuration, said configuration being stored in a non-volatile memory. The user can configure or customize the infusion pump to conform to his standard usage protocol. Microprocessor-controlled infusion pumps have become widely accepted and used in hospitals for the delivery of a variety of medications. These types of devices are particularly useful for postÂ¬ operative pain management wherein a pain relieving medication is administered to the patient at a small infusion rate. These types of devices are especially useful for Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) procedures wherein within certain time constraints, a patient may request and receive an additional pain relieving dose. b. Description of the Prior ArtTo adequately describe the scheme some background is necessary. As the technology involved in designing drug infusion pumps has become more advanced, such pumps have become more complex. The earliest electronic drug infusion devices simply delivered fluid at a fixed rate. Later devices allowed a selection of rates using a mechanical means, such as a clutch and a transmission. Eventually the pumps advanced to the point where rates could be selected using thumb-wheel switches 

or rotary knobs and dials. Electronic circuitry inside the pumps interpreted these switches and dials and automatically ran the motor at the proper rate. With the advent of microprocessor technology, the pumps developed to the point where their activities over time could be varied. The Bard PCA made by the assignee of the present invention is an example of such a device. A user can select a constant infusion rate, as well as parameters to define a patient requestable dose. Based on the information programmed into the pump by the doctor, the pump can automatically administer pain medication at the patient's push-button request. The patient is only permitted to receive a dose after a certain amount of time has passed since the last dose.With the sophisticated microprocessor technology available today however, the number of choices in programming an infusion pump has increased. With this increase in choices comes an increased risk of programming errors. The increase in choices also contributes to the user's dissatisfaction with the complexity of the device. Programming a pump for operation in many cases has become complex,
