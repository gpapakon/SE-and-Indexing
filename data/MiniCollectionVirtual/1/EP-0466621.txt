Process for protecting a container (1) used in nurseries 
and horticulture, presenting an upper opening (2) 

to fill it with earth or any other substrate (22), in 
which a hollow (21) is made, adapted to receive a plant 

(24) and protected by the positioning of a cover, characterized 
in that, before said plant (24) is placed in position 

and after filling, and production of said hollow: 

there is firmly fixed on said opening (2) a water- and 
air-permeable sheet (7) closing said opening and 

ensuring said protection by covering said substrate (22); 
said sheet (7) is perforated (23) at the centre 
of said opening (2), to dimensions which are adjustable 

and given as a function of said plant; 
at any moment subsequent to the preceding operations, 
said plant (24) is planted in the hollow (21) 

then located beneath said sheet (7), and through said 
perforation (23). 
Container protecting process according to Claim 
1, characterized in that, prior to the fixing operation, 

said sheet (7) is dispensed from a roll of web (25) unwound 
in a given direction above said container (1) and which 

is cut after the fixing operation behind said container 
(1) in order to disconnect it therefrom. 
Container protecting process according to Claim 
2, characterized in that a plurality of said containers 

(1) are driven one behind the other by any means (4) 
beneath said web of sheet (25) and in the same direction 

as its unwinding in order to fix said sheet thereon, 
to perforate it and cut it in the same successive operations 

for each container as in the first Claim, all the 
operations then taking place simultaneously on a plurality 

of containers at a time, the assembly thereof then being  
 

displaced from one operational station to the following 
at the same time. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that said sheet (7) is fixed on the container 

(1) by heat-sealing. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
a container (1) and sheet (7) made of heat-meltable material 

are chosen, the melting point of the sheet being 
lower than that of the container and said sheet (7) is 

fixed on said container by pressure, jointly with a sufficient 
heating to heat-seal it. 
Machine for protecting containers (1) used in nurseries 
and horticulture presenting an upper opening (2) 

to fill it with earth or any other substrate (22) in 
which a hollow (21) is made, adapted to receive a plant 

(24), and protected by positioning a cover, characterized 
in that it comprises, before any operational station 

for positioning said plant (24), at least: 

a station (8) for fixing on said opening (2) a 
water- and air-permeable sheet (7) closing said opening 

and ensuring said protection by covering the substrate 
(22), 
a station (9) for perforating (23) said sheet 
(7) at the centre of said opening (2), to adjustable 

dimensions given as a function of said plant (24), 
a system (4) for supplying and driving a plurality 
of containers (1) on the same line and passing beneath 

at least each of these stations (8, 9), beneath which 
the containers are successively stopped, by any timing 

means, for a sufficient period of time to allow each 
of the corresponding operations; 
a means (20) for evacuating said containers (1) 
thus protected which may then subsequently receive a 

plant (24), at any moment, in the hollow (21) then located  
 

beneath said sheet (7), and through said perforation 
(23). 
Container protecting machine according to Claim 
6, characterized in that it comprises a roll of web (25) 

of sheet (7) which is unwound by any means above said 
containers (1) and the drive means (4) along the same 

line and same direction of drive, and, after the perforating 
station (9), a station (10) for cutting out said 

sheet (7) to disconnect the parts then fixed on the containers 
from the supply web (25). 
Container (1) used in nurseries and horticulture, presenting 
an upper opening (2) to fill it with any substrate 

(22) in which is made a hollow (21) adapted to receive 
a plant (24) and which is protected by a cover fixed 

on said opening (2), at least perforated at and in the 
vicinity of its centre and through which the stem 3 of 

the plant projects, characterized in that said cover 
is an air- and water-permeable sheet (7), perforated 

solely at and in the vicinity of the centre of the opening 
(2) of the container (1) so that the stem (3) of this 

plant is surrounded over the whole of its circumference 
and in continuous manner thereby. 
Container according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that said sheet (7) is a non-woven textile material. 
Container according to either one of Claims 7 and 
8, characterized in that the container (1) and said sheet 

(7) are made of heat-meltable material and, as the melting 
point of the latter is lower than that of the container 

(1), said sheet is heat-sealed on the latter without 
deteriorating it.
