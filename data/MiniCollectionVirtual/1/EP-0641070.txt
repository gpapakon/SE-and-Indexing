<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for adjusting the volume of a car radio to the ambient noise level, the AF signal level present behind a controlling element arranged in the AF signal path and the travelling noise signal being supplied to a control loop which attempts to minimise the difference between the AF signal and the travelling noise signal. So that the controlling element does not ramp up during a pause in the signal in the presence of a travelling noise level, an AF pause detector is provided which, by means of a variable threshold value, evaluates AF passages with low signal level as pauses and slowly drops the AF signal level during these pauses.

Method for adapting the loudness level of a
mobile reproduction unit, in particular a car radio, to

an ambient noise level, the AF signal level downstream
of an actuator (2) arranged in the AF signal path (A-B)

and the driving-noise signal level (FG) being fed to a
first level-comparison stage (V1), which, together with

a regulating element (1) and the actuator (2), forms a
regulating circuit which aims to minimize the difference

between the AF signal level and the driving-noise signal
level, the regulating circuit (V1, 1, 2) being

deactivated during a pause in the AF signal level,

characterized

in that, in a second level-comparison stage (v2), the
envelope level (HP) of the AF signal is compared at

predetermined time intervals (Δt) with a continually
rising output signal (IP) of a resettable

integrator (3),
in that, as long as the envelope level (HP) is higher
than the integrator output signal (IP) at a comparison

instant, the integrator output signal (IP) continues to
rise and the regulating circuit (V1, 1, 2) is activated,
and in that, as long as the envelope level (HP) is lower

than the integrator output signal (IP) at a comparison
instant, that is to say for the duration of the time

period assessed as AF signal pause (T), the integrator 
output signal (IP) is reset to the instantaneous value

of the envelope level (HP) in order to rise from that
point until the next comparison instant, and the

regulating loop (V1, 1, 2) of the regulating circuit is
deactivated, while a control signal influencing the

level of the AF signal is fed to the actuator (2).
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the AF level in the AF signal path (A-B) is
slowly reduced for the duration of an AF signal

pause (T).
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized

in that the external control signal fed to the
actuator (2) for the duration of an AF signal pause (T)

is such that it steadily reduces the AF signal level.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized

in that the changeover of the regulating loop (V1, 1, 2)
is effected via a third level-comparison stage (V3), in

which the envelope level (HP) is compared, during the
time not occupied by an AF signal pause (T) determined

by the second level-comparison stage (V2), with an
integrator output signal (IP) increased by the magnitude

of an offset voltage and is compared, during the time
occupied by an AF signal pause (T) that has been determined,

with an envelope signal (HP) increased by the
magnitude of the offset voltage, these signals being fed

to the third level-comparison stage (V3) via an addition
element (5), which increases the signals by the

magnitude of the offset voltage.

of an actuator (2) arranged in the AF signal path (A-B)

and the driving-noise signal level (FG) being fed to a
first level-comparison stage (V1), which, together with

a regulating element (1) and the actuator (2), forms a
regulating circuit which aims to minimize the difference 

between the AF signal level and the driving-noise signal
level (FG),

switch (S1), to the output of the first level-comparison
stage (V1) when the said changeover switch is in a first

switch position, and to a control voltage source when
the said changeover switch is in a second switch

position,

characterized

in that provision is made of a second level-comparison
stage (V2) for comparing an envelope level (HP) of the

AF signal with a continually rising output signal (IP)
of a resettable integrator (3), for which purpose the

input terminal for the AF signal is connected to the
first input of the second level-comparison stage (V2)

via an envelope demodulator (4) and the output of the
integrator (3) is connected to the second input of the

said second level-comparison stage (V2),
in that the envelope level (HP) and the integrator
output signal (IP) are compared at predetermined time

intervals (At), for which purpose the input of the
integrator (3) is connected to a pulse source,
in that the output of the second level-comparison
stage (V2) is connected to the control input of the

first electronic changeover switch (S1) and also to a
control input, provided for resetting, of the

integrator (3) and the output of the envelope
demodulator (4) is connected to a further input of the

integrator (3), with the result that, as long as the
envelope level (HP) is higher than the integrator output

signal (IP) at a comparison instant, the regulating
circuit (V1, 1, 2) is activated and the integrator

output signal (IP) continues to rise, while as long as
the envelope level (HP) is lower than the integrator

output signal (IP) at a comparison instant, that is to
say for the duration of the time period assessed as AF

signal pause (T), the integrator output signal (IP) is
reset to the instantaneous value of the envelope 

level (HP) in order to rise from that point until the
next comparison instant, and the regulating loop
