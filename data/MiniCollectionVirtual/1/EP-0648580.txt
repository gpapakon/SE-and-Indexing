<ABSTRACT>
Piston-ringing apparatus comprises a tubular piston 
nest member (10) for receiving each piston (p) to locate the 

piston groove in a predetermined ring-receiving 
position, a plurality of ring cartridges positionable 

one at a time in alignment with the piston nest member (10). 
The aligned ring cartridge (30) is engaged to the piston nest 

member (10) to permit transfer of rings from the ring 
cartridge (30) to the piston nest member (10) and disengage the 

aligned ring cartridge when empty of rings. The stack of 
rings on the cartridge is moved by opposing fingers (80,82) 

toward the piston groove to position an endmost ring 
residing on the nest member (10) in the groove of each 

successive piston received in the nest member while the 
aligned ring cartridge (30) is engaged thereto. A fiber optic 

switch (130) is provided for directing a light beam 
tangentially through the piston groove to determine 

whether a ring is positioned therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to piston-ringing 
apparatus for high volume assembly of compression, 
expander or other rings in circumferential grooves of 
pistons for internal combustion engines. Compression and expander rings are widely used in 
the assembly of pistons for internal combustion engines. 
Compression rings typically are made of cast iron or 
steel and precision ground so as to be nearly perfectly 
flat and thus resistant (stiff) to bending out of a flat 
profile. Compression rings can be from 3 mm to 1 mm in 
thickness and have square or radiused inner diameters. Expander rings, on the other hand, typically are 
made of stainless steel and include vertical and/or 
horizontal corrugations. Expander rings are relatively 
flimsy and easily bendable out of a flat profile as 
compared to compression rings during the assembly 
operation into the respective piston grooves. Expander 
rings can be from 4 mm to 1 mm in thickness. Internal combustion engine pistons typically have 
several rings positioned in respective circumferential 
grooves proximate the closed (domed) end of the piston. 
For example, a typical internal combustion engine piston  
 
will include an inner expander ring with so-called rail 
rings on opposite sides thereof in the same groove, an 
intermediate cast iron compression ring, and cast iron 
or steel outer compression ring proximate the closed 
(domed) end of the piston. There is a need for piston ringing apparatus that 
can be used to assemble the compression and expander 
rings onto internal combustion engine pistons at one or 
more piston ringing stations under high volume 
production conditions where lengthy interruptions or 
downtime in the piston ringing operation due to the need 
to supply rings to the ringing station(s) is avoided. There also is a need for piston ringing apparatus 
that can be used to assemble compression and expander 
rings onto internal combustion engine pistons at one or 
more piston ringing stations and that can be further 
automated in a manner that improves the assembly rate 
and reliability of ring/piston assembly. It is an object of the invention to satisfy these 
needs. The present invention provides apparatus for 
assembling a ring on each of successive pistons, wherein 
the apparatus comprises a piston nest member for 
engaging each piston in a manner to locate the piston 
groove in a predetermined ring-receiving position. The 
piston nest member includes an outer periphery for 
storing a stack of rings end-to-end thereon and includes 
an

Apparatus for assembling a ring on each of 
successive pistons, comprising: 


a) a piston nest member for engaging each piston 
in a manner to locate the piston groove in a 

predetermined ring-receiving position, said nest member 
including an outer periphery for storing a stack of 

rings end-to-end thereon and having an annular first end 
proximate to which the piston groove is positioned when 

each piston is engaged to said piston nest member and a 
second end remote from said first end, 
b) a plurality of ring cartridges each including a 
stack of rings arranged end-to-end along its length, 
c) means for positioning one of the ring 
cartridges at a time in alignment with the tubular 

piston nest member, 
d) means for relatively moving the aligned ring 
cartridge and the piston nest member to engage the 

aligned ring cartridge with said second end of the 
piston nest member to permit transfer of rings from the 

aligned ring cartridge to the piston nest member and to 
disengage the aligned ring cartridge when empty of 

rings, and 
e) means for moving the stack of rings along the 
aligned ring cartridge toward said first nest member end 

to position an endmost ring residing on said nest 
periphery in the groove of each successive piston
