<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to neutral, aqueous soluble  beta -glucans which exert potent and specific immunological effects without stimulating the production of certain cytokines, to preparations containing the novel  beta -glucans, and to a novel manufacturing process therefor. The neutral, aqueous soluble  beta -glucan preparation has a high affinity for the  beta -glucan receptor of human monocytes and retains two primary biological (or immunological) activities, (1) the enhancement of microbicidal activity of phagocytic cells, and (2) monocyte, neutrophil and platelet hemopoietic activity. Unlike soluble glucans described in the prior art, the neutral, aqueous soluble  beta -glucan of this invention neither induces nor primes IL-1 beta  and TNF alpha production in vitro and in vivo. Safe and efficacious preparations of neutral, aqueous soluble  beta -glucan of the present invention can be used in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment regimens of humans and animals to enhance their immune response, without stimulating the production of certain biochemical mediators (e.g., IL-1 beta , TNF alpha ) that can cause detrimental side effects, such as fever and inflammation.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the early 1960's, zymosan, a crude insoluble yeast
extract prepared by boiling yeast before and after trypsin
treatment, was noted to produce marked hyperplasia and
functional stimulation of the reticuloendothelial system
in rodents. In animal studies, zymosan preparations were
shown to inactivate complement component C3, to enhance
antibody formation, to promote survival following
irradiation, to increase resistance to bacterial
infections, to inhibit tumor development, to promote graft
rejection, and to inhibit dietary-induced
hypercholesterolemia and cholesterosis. Zymosan was shown
to consist of polysaccharides, proteins, fats, and
inorganic elements; however, subsequent studies identified
the active components of the yeast cell wall as a pure
polysaccharide, specifically β-glucan. In conventional
nomenclature, the polysaccharide β-glucan is known as
poly-(1-6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-3)-β-D-glucopyranose
(PGG). Repetition of biological assays with β-glucan
indicated that most of the above functional activities
identified with zymosan were retained by the purified β-glucan
preparation.The properties of β-glucan are quite similar to those
of endotoxin in increasing nonspecific immunity and resistance
to infection. The activities of β-glucan as an
immune adjuvant and hemopoietic stimulator compare to
those of more complex biological response modifiers
(BRMs), such as bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and
Corynebacteriumparvum. The functional activities of
yeast β-glucan are also comparable to those structurally
similar carbohydrate polymers isolated from fungi and
plants. These higher molecular weight (1-3)-β-D-glucans
such as schizophyllan, lentinan, krestin, grifolan, and 
pachyman exhibit similar immunomodulatory activities. A
common mechanism shared by all these β-glucan preparations
is their stimulation of cytokines such as interleukin-1
(IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Lentinan has been
extensively investigated for its antitumor properties,
both in animal models at 1 mg/kg for 10 days and in
clinical trials since the late 1970s in Japan for advanced
or recurrent malignant lymphoma and colorectal, mammary,
lung and gastric cancers. In cancer chemotherapy,
lentinan has been administered at 0.5-5 mg/day,
intramuscularly (I.M.) or intravenously (I.V.), two or
three times per week alone, or in combination with
antineoplastic drugs. In addition to the activities
ascribed to yeast glucans, studies suggest lentinan acts
as a T-cell immunopotentiator, inducing cytotoxic
activities, including
