<ABSTRACT>
The connecting shanks (2, 3) of two components, which are constructed with a basically rectangular cross-sectional shape, are pushed into a printed circuit board hole (1) in a T-shaped basic arrangement, at least one connecting shank being elastically deformable so that the pushed-in connecting shanks form an elastic push-in zone (4). In consequence, two components, for example two screening plates on a plug connector, can be fastened to the printed circuit board in a single hole using a push-in technique, from opposite sides of the printed circuit board. The invention is suitable for push-in fastenings of components, especially in the case of plug connectors.

Press-in fastening, for components designed with
a connecting pin, in printed circuit board holes, the

connecting pins of the components having a basic shape of
rectangular cross section, in particular for plug-in

connectors or parts thereof, characterized by the
following features:


a) in order to fasten two components in a printed circuit
board hole (1) from opposite sides of the printed circuit

board, the connecting pins (2, 3) of the two components
are pressed into the printed circuit board hole (1) in a

T-shaped basic arrangement,
b) the connecting pin (2) forming the transverse bar of
the T-shaped basic arrangement is inserted into the

printed circuit board hole (1) first,
c) at least one connecting pin (2, 3) is elastically
deformable, so that the connecting pins of the two

components form an elastic press-in zone (4) when
inserted into the printed circuit board hole (1).
Press-in fastening according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the connecting pin (2) forming the

transverse bar is elastically deformable, and the
connecting pin (3) forming the longitudinal bar is rigid.
Press-in fastening according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the connecting pin (2a) forming the

transverse bar is pre-shaped in a manner matching the
wall of the printed circuit board hole (1), and the

connecting pin (3a) forming the longitudinal bar is
elastically deformable.
Press-in fastening according to Claim 3,
characterized in that, following its insertion into the 

printed circuit board hole (1), the connecting pin
(2, 2a) forming the transverse bar is locked in the

longitudinal direction.
Press-in fastening according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the connecting pin (2, 2a) forming

the transverse bar is designed with at least one latching
element that latches over the edge of the printed circuit

board hole (1).
Press-in fastening according to one of Claims 3
to 5, characterized in that the connecting pin (3b)

forming the longitudinal bar is designed with an elastic
press-in zone (5) that is impressed on two opposite sides

(6, 7) into the basic shape of rectangular cross section
and has an S-shaped or Z-shaped cross-sectional profile.
