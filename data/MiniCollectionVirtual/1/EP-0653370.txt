<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
controlling an elevator group. According 

to the invention, the landing calls 
issued from different floors are weighted 

by a floor-specific weight factor. The 
weighted call time is utilized in the 

calculation of the serving time of the 
calls and for the selection of the best 

elevator to serve a landing call.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for controlling
an elevator group, as defined in the preamble of claim 1.In the control of the elevators in an elevator group, one
objective is to ensure that customers are served in an
optimal way in different traffic situations. A customer who
presses an elevator call button should be served within a
reason able time both in peak-traffic conditions and during
low-traffic hours. Various group control procedures are
known which make use of traffic statistics for the control
of the elevators or which involve monitoring of the waiting
time of customers. A procedure used for group control, more
precisely speaking selection of traffic type in group
control, is known from patent US 5,229,559.Previously known group control methods are not adaptable for
situations in which the elevator users on a certain floor or
certain floors are to be guaranteed a certain average or
even above-average level of service. Especially during heavy
traffic, e.g. upward and downward peak traffic, floors where
the traffic is heavier than average may be ill served. This
is because the number of people waiting behind the calls on
each floor is generally not known.The object of the present invention is to develop a group
control method which allows indvidual weighting of each
floor or group of floors in the control of the elevators. To
achieve this, the invention is characterized by the features
presented in the characterization part of claim 1. Other
embodiments of the invention are defined in the subclaims.The procedure of the invention enables the person responsible
for the operation of the elevators in a building to
define a floor-specific service profile. In peak-traffic
situations, the waiting times for the floors selected and
for the passengers coming from those floors will not be 
longer than the average value, and the waiting times are
also shortened in certain traffic situations. The procedure
is suited for use with different group control systems
without requiring any other changes in the control.In the following, the invention is described by the aid of
one of its embodiments by referring to the drawings, in which
- Fig. 1presents a block diagram illustrating the control
of an elevator group,- Fig. 2presents a block diagram illustrating the principle
of group control of an elevator, and- Fig. 3illustrates the selection of an elevator by the
method of the invention.The diagram in Fig. 1 illustrates the structure of the control
system of an elevator group. The landing calls

<CLAIMS>
Procedure for controlling the elevators in an elevator
group consisting of two or more elevators in order to serve

calls issued by means of call buttons mounted at the landings,
in which procedure each elevator is controlled by an

elevator control unit and the elevator group is controlled
by a group control unit and in which a cost function is

calculated for the calls, said cost function comprising at
least an elevator-specific factor and a floor-specific

factor, 
characterized
 in that an adjustable weight factor
profile is defined for the calls by weighting the calls

issued from at least one floor other than the entrance floor
with floor-specific weight factors and that the order in

which the calls are served is determined by the group
control unit.
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
weight factor profile is defined on the basis of the intensity

of passenger traffic on the floor.
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
weight factor profile can be adjusted separately for each

floor.
Procedure according to claim 1 - 3, 
characterized
 in that
the order in which the calls are served is determined on the

basis of the call time.
Procedure according to claim 1 - 3, 
characterized
 in that
the order in which the calls are served is determined on the

basis of the customer's waiting time.
Procedure according to claim 1 - 5, 
characterized
 in that
the weight factors are permanently in force.
Procedure according to claim 1 - 5, 
characterized
 in that
the weight factors vary as a function of time.
