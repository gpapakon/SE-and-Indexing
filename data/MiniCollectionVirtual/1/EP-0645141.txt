<ABSTRACT>
Treating water for dermatoses in domestic animals mainly composed of acidic water 
obtained by electrolysis, which acidic water is highly effective in treatment of a dermatosis 

in a domestic animal when applied or sprayed to domestic animals several times at an initial 
stage of the dermatosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to treating water for a dermatosis in a domestic animal which
is effective in treatment of epidermal diseases in domestic animals such as cattle and swine.Domestic animals such as cattle and swine have often suffered from dermatoses, probably
because they are crowded in a limited space for their farming. Especially, in cattle farming,
cattle are likely to suffer from dermatomycosis (hereinafter referred to as DM) which arises
from infection of the skin with T.verrucosum and sometimes causes cattle to die. Similarly,
in swine fanning, swine are likely to suffer from an exudative epidermitis (hereinafter referred
to as EE) generally called "greasy pig disease", which is caused by infection of the skin with
Staphylococcus hyicus. In EE, exudation of blood components out of the blood vessel in the
affected part sometimes causes swine to die through intracorporeal infection.In treatment of such dermatoses, it is conventional to apply or spray proper antibacterial
agents locally or systemically according to sensitivities of pathogenic bacteria of respective
dermatoses.The present inventors have found that it is highly effective in treatment of dermatoses in
domestic animals to apply or spray acidic water obtained by continuous electrolysis of salt tap
water several times at an initial stage, and have proposed treating water for dermatoses in
domestic animals composed mainly of the acidic water obtained by continuous electrolysis of
salt tap water (Japanese Patent Application No.239099/1993).However, antibacterial agents are not so effective in serious cases, and treatment of
dermatoses with antibacterial agents often end in failure due to induction of resistance of 
pathogenic bacteria against the antibacterial agent.GB-A-1,484,878 discloses an apparatus for treatment of teeth
and other parts of the oral cavity with an aqueous solution of
sodium-chloride which is electrolyzed. During electrolysis
active substances such as NaOCl and O3 are formed in the
aqueous solution which is sprayed into the mouth.Derwent Abstract No. 93-061 087 corresponding to JP-A-5-7876,
Derwent Abstract No. 87-353 296 corresponding to JP-A-62-258
312 and Derwent Abstract No. 86-039 675 corresponding to JP-A-60-260
507 disclose different solutions or lotions for face
washing by applying acidic ionized water to the face. The
acidic water is produced by using a device which ionizes water
by electrolysis. An application of this lotion is treatment of
acne.McGraw-Hill: Encyclopedia of Chemistry 1983, page 293

<CLAIMS>
Use of acidic water for the manufacture of a preparation
effective for treating of dermatosis in a domestic animal which

acidic water is mainly composed of electrolysis acidic water
having a pH of at most 2.6 and a high oxidation-reduction

potential of at least + 1050 mV, a concentration of active
chlorine of 15 to 30 ppm and a concentration of dissolved

oxygen of 20 to 30 ppm.
The use according to claim 1, wherein said acidic water
inhibits growth of 
T. verrucosum
 and changes the bacterium
morphologically, when applied or sprayed.
The use according to claim 1, wherein said acidic water
causes disruption of a growing environment for 
S. Hyicus,
 and
changes and breaks down a cell membrane of the bacterium, when

applied or sprayed.
