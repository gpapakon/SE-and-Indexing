<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inspection 
apparatus for inspecting the high frequency characteristics 
of a high frequency semiconductor device, an inspection 
method of inspecting a high frequency semiconductor 
device with the use of the inspection apparatus 
above-mentioned, and a high frequency semiconductor 
device to be inspected with the inspection apparatus 
above-mentioned. With the recent general spread of high frequency 
machinery and tools, there is increased a demand for a 
high frequency semiconductor device used in such machinery 
and tools. Therefore, it is of urgent necessity to 
establish a method of inspecting such a high frequency 
semiconductor device. The following description will discuss an example 
of a conventional method of inspecting a high frequency 
semiconductor device with reference to attached drawings. First, there is discussed the arrangement of a high 
frequency amplifying circuit to which such a conventional 
inspecting method is applied.  Fig. 20 shows the high frequency amplifying circuit 
above-mentioned, which has field-effect transistors 
(hereinafter referred to as FETs) 101, 102, and resistors 
110, 111. By the resistors 110, 111, the gate-source bias 
voltages of the FETs 101, 102 are set to 0 V. Capacitors 
120, 121 are disposed for interrupting a low frequency 
component and a direct current component of a signal, 
thereby to transmit only a high frequency component 
thereof. Inductors 130, 131 are disposed for giving a 
direct current to the FETs 101, 102 and for preventing a 
high frequency signal (RF signal) from escaping to the 
power source side. There are also disposed an RF signal 
input terminal 150, an RF signal output terminal 151, 
power source terminals 152, 153, and grounding terminals 
160. In Fig. 20, the high frequency amplifying circuit is 
roughly divided by a point a into two portions, i.e., a 
front-stage block which is located in the left hand with 
respect to the point a and a rear-stage block which is 
located in the right hand with respect to the point a. The following description will discuss the operation 
of the high frequency amplifying circuit having the 
arrangement above-mentioned. As a power voltage, 5.0 V is given to the power 
source terminals 152, 153 so that an electric current is 
supplied to the FETs 101, 102. In the FETs 101, 102, the  
 
gate-source bias voltages are fixed to 0 V by the resistors 
110, 111. When an RF signal is entered from the RF 
signal input terminal 150, the RF signal is amplified by 
the
