<ABSTRACT>
An article (200) comprising a main sheath portion formed of a flexible and/or elastic material closed at a distal end (32) thereof and open at a proximal end (34) thereof, with a first flange element (6) formed of a flexible and elastic material, and having an aperture (8) formed or pressure-formable therein, secured to the open proximal end of the sheath. In a single flange embodiment, the main sheath portion (70) may be provided in a center-compacted configuration, for bi-directional application of the sheath. In a multi-flange embodiment, a second flange element (20) is secured at an outer portion thereof to the first flange element and has an aperture (21) formed or pressure-formable therein, in substantial alignment with the aperture of the first flange element, whereby the sheath is extended or extensible from a compacted state through the aperture in either the first or the second flange element. In a specific embodiment, the article comprises a condom which may be donned in either of two directions. Such bidirectionally donnable condom article is characterized by ease of use and improved safety and reliability, as compared to prior art condoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to flanged, generally
tubular articles, including bidirectionally donnable multiple
flange condom articles, and to method and apparatus for making and
using such articles.In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the
incidence and spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and this
phenomenon has in turn caused an increased use of condoms as a 
prophylactic measure to reduce the risk of infection and
transmission of such diseases.Among the reasons for the increase in incidence and rate of
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are the
development of increasingly antibiotic-resistant strains of
disease-causing organisms, e.g., those responsible for diseases
such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Another factor has been the
absence of any effective cure for acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS).Against the foregoing background, and the recognition that
condoms afford a safe, low cost, and generally reliable means for
combatting the spread of STDs including AIDS, there has been an
increased demand for condoms.Currently, most condoms are produced from a latex resin via a
dipping process in which a cylindrical and rounded-end mold is
dipped into a resin bath, so that the mold is coated with a thin
layer of the latex material. The thickness of the latex coating
on the mold is dependent on the viscosity of the latex, and the
speed of extracting the mold from the latex bath. Similar latex
dipping processes have been employed with suitably shaped molds to
form tight-fitting gloves such as surgical gloves.The above-described latex dipping process has been utilized
for decades, and yields a generally satisfactory barrier product
at reasonable cost.With the recent spread of AIDS in the general population and
the resurgence of condom usage in sexual activities, there has
been interest in improving the strength and reliability
characteristics of condoms, and of achieving improvements in
manufacturing processes and economics, to further combat the
spread of STDs generally, and AIDS specifically, as well as to
provide a safe, reliable, and convenient contraceptive means. In
this respect, there is a continuing need to provide condoms in a
readily packaged form. The packaging itself should ensure the
physical integrity, safety, and effectiveness of the condom are
maintained. The package and the condom should be designed in a 
manner facilitating ready removal and use of the condom, in order
to enhance the appeal of using condoms in coital activity.U.S.

whereby to bear compressively against the circumference

of the member when sheathed in the article;
a second flange element (20), having a second flange
aperture (21) having a diameter smaller than the

diameter of the main sheath, the second flange aperture
being in substantial registration with the first flange

aperture of the first flange element;

characterised in that the second flange element (20) is
integrally and permanently secured at its outer

peripheral portion to the first flange element, and in
that the second flange aperture (21) is formed or

pressure-formable in the second flange element, where
the main sheath is compactable to a centre-compacted

form reposable between the first and second flange
elements, and the second flange aperture is sized

whereby to bear compressively against the circumference
of the member when sheathed in the article.
An article according to claim 1 characterised in that
the sheath is formed of a flexible and/or elastic

material and in that the first and second flange 
elements are formed of flexible and elastic material,

and also characterised in that the sheath is formed
from a thermoplastic elastomeric material selected from

the group consisting of polyurethanes; polyether block
amides; styrene-rubber-styrene block copolymers;

polyesters; olefinic homopolymers and copolymers; and
