<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an applicator in which the internal pressure 
of the fluid tank (1) can selectively be increased, and the 

fluid to be applied is prevented from being discharged 
excessively during application. In the applicator of the 

invention, the cap (6) is provided with a short first inner 
barrel (7) and a long second inner barrel (8) which are disposed in 

such a way that the openings of these inner barrels may 
face in opposite directions, so that, when the neck of the 

applicator is inserted to the short first inner barrel to 
seal the tip (3), the pressure rise in the first inner barrel 

is adapted to be small so as not to substantially increase 
the internal pressure of the fluid tank, whereas when the 

neck is inserted to the long second inner barrel, the 
pressure rise in the second inner barrel is adapted to be 

great so as to increase the internal pressure of the fluid 
tank. Alternatively, the applicator may additionally be 

provided with a pressurizing means (9) having a plurality of 
sealing barrels with different lengths (91,92,93), so that when the 

tip is sealed by inserting the neck into one of the sealing 
barrels, the internal pressure of the corresponding sealing 

barrel may be increased depending on its length whereby to 
increase the internal pressure of the fluid tank (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an applicator combination according 
to the preamble of claim 1 and to an applicator and an accessory 
according to the preamble of claim 2, both with an applicator 
which is filled with a highly viscous fluid to be applied 
such as correction fluid and make-up fluid. In an applicator having a spherical form of application 
member (application ball), a tip is attached to the neck 
formed at the front end of a fluid tank which is filled 
with a fluid to be applied, and the tip bears rotatably 
therein an application ball in such a way that the 
application ball may partly be exposed from the front edge 
thereof like in a ball-point pen. The application ball is 
resiliently urged by a spring so as to bring the 
application ball into intimate contact with the caulked 
front edge of the tip, when the applicator is not used, 
whereby to allow the application ball and the front edge of 
the tip to form a valve structure, preventing the fluid 
from being discharged. When the application ball is pressed against a surface to 
be treated for application of the fluid, the application 
ball retracts against the resilience of the spring to 
provide a clearance between the application ball and the 
front edge of the tip, allowing the fluid deposited to the 
hidden portion of the application ball locating within the 
tip to be delivered through the clearance to the outside of 
the tip and applied as the application ball rolls. 
However, since the fluid is highly viscous, the fluid 
cannot normally be fed fully to the surface of the 
application ball. Accordingly, the fluid tank is molded by 
means of blowing using a flexible material so as to be 
squeezable, and the fluid tank is pressed between the 
fingers to increase the internal pressure of the fluid tank  
 
when the applicator is used to allow the fluid to be fed 
out to the exposed surface of the application ball with the 
aid of the thus increased pressure. Thus, the prior art applicator suffers inconveniences that 
the handling thereof is troublesome since the fluid tank 
must be pressed between the fingers to increase the 
internal pressure when the fluid is to be applied, and 
besides the production cost elevates since the fluid tank 
must be molded by means of blowing using a flexible 
material. Therefore, if according to Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 
017, No. 368 (M-1443), July 12, 1993, and JP-A-05 058 090 
(Hori Jiro), March 9, 1993, on which the preambles of claims 
1 and 2 are based, a cap is designed to be able to be

<CLAIMS>
An applicator combination, comprising 
a cap (6); 


an application ball (4) retained rotatably in a tip (3) 
such that said application ball (4) may partly be exposed from 

the front edge (31) of said tip (3); 
a spring (5) for resiliently urging said application ball 
(4) to be abutted against the caulked front edge (31) of said 

tip (3); 
a neck (2) holding said tip (3) therein; 
and a fluid tank (1) formed contiguous to said neck (2), 
in which a highly viscous film-forming fluid to be applied is 

contained, and said tip (3) being adapted to be sealed by said 
cap (6) when the outer circumference (21) of said neck (2) is 

brought into intimate contact with the inner circumference of 
an inner barrel (7, 8) of said cap (6); characterized in that 
said cap (6) is provided with a short first inner barrel 
(7) and a long second inner barrel (8) which are disposed in 

such a way that the opening of said first inner barrel (7) and 
that of said second inner barrel (8) may face in opposite directions; 

and when said neck (2) is inserted in said short 
first inner barrel (7) to seal said tip (3), the internal 

pressure of said first inner barrel (7) is increased a little, 
so that the internal pressure of said fluid tank (1) may not 

substantially be increased, whereas when said neck (2) is inserted 
to said long second inner barrel (8) to seal said tip 

(3), the internal pressure of said second inner barrel (8) is 
increased greatly, so that the internal pressure of said fluid 

tank (1) may be increased. 
An applicator and an accessory, comprising: 

an application ball (4) retained rotatably in a tip (3)  
 

such that said application ball (4) may partly be exposed from 
the front edge (31) of said tip (3); 
a spring (5) for resiliently urging said application ball 
(4) to be abutted against the caulked front edge (31) of said 

tip (3); 
a neck (2) holding said tip (3) therein; and 
a fluid tank (1) formed contiguous to said neck (2), in 
which a highly viscous film-forming fluid to be applied is 

contained; characterized in that 
said applicator has as said accessory a 
pressurizing means (9) provided with a plurality of sealing 

barrels (91, 92, 93) having different lengths, so that the internal 
pressure of said fluid tank (1) may be increased when 

said neck (2) is inserted to one of said sealing barrels (91, 
92, 93) to seal said tip (3) and increase the internal pressure 

of the corresponding sealing barrel (91, 92, 93) to a 
level depending on the length thereof.
