<ABSTRACT>
A shower head includes an outer casing (1) that is 
shaped so as to form a tubular portion (1a) which contains 

an elongated insert (2) which is associated with a 
cylindrical insert (3) that is contained in a head (1b) of 

the casing in order to be locked by means of a plug (4) 
provided with at least one outlet port (4b) for the exit of 

the water, characterized in that a ring (6) is located 
peripherally with respect to the cylindrical insert (3), is 

kept in position by the plug (4), and is suitable to abut 
against a raised portion (2c) which is provided in the end 

portion of the elongated insert in order to lock it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shower head.It is known that there are shower heads which have an
outer casing whose shape includes a cylindrical portion
which acts as a handle, contains an elongated insert that
has, at one end, a threaded portion for connection to a
water supply duct, and is connected, at its other end, to a
cylindrical insert which is contained in a tip portion of
the casing and is locked therein by a plug which has at
least one opening for the exit of the water conveyed by the
shower head.Many shower heads also include, inside the cylindrical
insert, a device that allows to switch from a central jet to
a peripheral jet.The outer casing is made of a material which has high-level
aesthetic characteristics but is not suitable for
withstanding mechanical stresses or temperature changes.Shower heads included in the prior art have the
drawback that they allow albeit partial contact of the
water, conveyed by the inserts located inside said shower
heads, with the outer casing: accordingly, the alternating
presence of hot and cold water that occurs during the normal
operation of the shower head causes temperature variations
in said outer casing that are sufficient to cause cracks and
breakage.In some types of shower head there is also another
drawback which arises from the fact that the elongated
insert is locked inside the tubular portion of the outer
casing, as required in order to contrast the thrusts
produced by water pressure, by means of a screw which passes 
through said outer casing: this fact, in addition to being
aesthetically unpleasant, introduces a discontinuity in the
surface of the casing that allows dirt to accumulate and
also produces in said casing local tensions that the
material of said casing is unable to withstand without being
negatively affected.A shower head in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, is
known from the document WO-A-9003598.The aim of the present invention is therefore to
provide a shower head in which the outer casing is fully
protected both in aesthetic terms and in terms of protection
against any kind of mechanical or thermal stress.This aim is achieved by a shower head, according to the
invention, which comprises an outer casing that is shaped so
as to form a tubular portion which contains an elongated
insert provided with a threaded portion at its end that
protrudes from the casing and is associated, at its other
end, with a cylindrical insert that is contained in a head of
the casing which is located at the end of the tubular
portion in order
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Shower head, comprising an outer casing (1) that is
shaped so as to form a tubular portion (1a) which contains

an elongated insert (2) provided with a threaded portion
(2a) at its end that protrudes from the casing and is

associated, at its other end, with a cylindrical insert (3)
that is contained in a head (1b) of the casing which is

located at the end of the tubular portion (1a) in order to
be locked thereat by means of a plug (4) provided with at

least one outlet port (4b) for the exit of the water
conveyed by the shower head, characterized in that it

further comprises a ring (6) which is located peripherally
with respect to said cylindrical insert (3), is kept in

position by said plug (4), and is adapted to abut against a
raised portion (2c) which is provided in the end portion

(2b) of the elongated insert (2) in order to lock it
with respect to the cylindrical insert.
Shower head according to claim 1, characterized in
that the ring (6) is provided with a slot (6a) which is

shaped complementarily with respect to the end portion (2b)
of the elongated insert (2) and is adapted to abut against

said circumferential raised portion (2c) formed on said end
portion (2b).
Shower head according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized by a gasket (7) that is

interposed between the ring (6) and the plug (4) that keeps
it in position.
Shower head, according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the cylindrical

insert (3) has a watertight wall and has, at its
lateral surface (3b), a water inlet port (3a) which is connected 

to the end portion (2b) of the elongated insert (2) and also
has, at one end face, at least one water outlet port (3e)

which is connected to the at least one outlet port (4b) that
is provided in the plug (4), the connections of said ports

(3a,3e,4b) having gaskets (8,15) that are adapted to prevent
any contact of the water with the outer casing.
Shower head according to claim, 4, comprising, inside
the cylindrical insert (3) a device (9,10,11) for switching

from a central jet to a peripheral jet, characterized in
that the end face of the cylindrical insert that lies

opposite to the one provided with water outlets (3e) is
shaped like a disk (3c) which is associated with the lateral

wall (3b) in the presence of a sealing gasket (16) and has a
central hole (3d) with a sealing gasket (14) for the passage

of a rod (9) that actuates said switching device.
