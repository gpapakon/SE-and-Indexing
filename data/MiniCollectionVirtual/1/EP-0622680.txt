<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a frame-supported pellicle used for dustproof protection 
of a photomask in the photolithographic patterning work 

for the manufacture of electronic fine devices such as LSIs, VLSIs 
and the like by mounting thereon. The inventive frame-supported 

pellicle is characterized in that the pellicle frame made from an 
anodization-treated aluminum-based alloy, to which a pellicle 

membrane is adhesively bonded on one of the end surfaces, is coated 
on the whole surface with a coating layer of an organic polymer 

such as an amorphous fluorine-containing polymer. The use of this 

inventive frame-supported pellicle can solve the heretofore unavoidable 
problem of dust particle deposition on the photomask 

even under dustproof protection with a pellicle, for which no remedial 
means has been proposed heretofore due to the unclear mechanism 

of such dust particle occurrence, by virtue of the smoothing 
effect of the anodized aluminum surface which otherwise is microscopically 

very rugged to be responsible for the formation of 
dust particles by rubbing with the surface of the holder case during 

transportation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frame-supported dustproof
pellicle for a photolithographic photomask used in the patterning
works in the manufacture of, for example, fine electronic materials
such as semiconductor devices and liquid display panels. More
particularly, the invention relates to a frame-supported dustproof
pellicle for a photolithographic photomask, which is almost completely
freed from the troubles due to occurrence of dust particles
from the pellicle frame per se.As is known, the photolithographic method is well established
in the patterning works for the manufacture of semiconductor
devices, such as LSIs, VLSIs and the like, liquid crystal display
panels and other electronic materials, in which the photoresist layer
formed on the surface of a substrate such as a silicon semiconductor
wafer is pattern-wise irradiated with ultraviolet light
through a transparency called a photomask followed by development
to form a patterned resist layer. In view of the extremely
high fineness and precision required in this patterning work, it is
very important that the photomask is absolutely dust-free since,
when dust particles are deposited on the photomask, the ultraviolet
light passing through the photomask is necessarily scattered by
the dust particles to give a great influence on the quality of the 
reproduced pattern such as fidelity to the photomask pattern and
contrast of the images.It is therefore a usual practice that the photolithographic
patterning work is conducted in a clean room under an atmosphere
freed from any floating dust particles as completely as possible although
perfect cleanness can hardly be obtained even in a clean
room of the highest cleanness. Accordingly, deposition of dust particles
on the photomask must be prevented by mounting a frame-supported
dustproof pellicle on the photomask. The frame-supported
dustproof pellicle above mentioned is a device consisting of a
frame made from a rigid material such as an aluminum alloy and a
thin, highly transparent film of a polymer, which is called a pellicle
membrane, stretched over and adhesively bonded to one end
surface of the frame in a drumhead-like slack-free fashion.When a frame-supported pellicle is mounted on the photomask,
the dust particles floating in the atmospheric air and falling
therefrom are never deposited directly on the photomask but deposited
on the pellicle membrane. Since the light beams used for the
pattern-wise irradiation are focused at the patterned images on
the photomask, the dust particles deposited on
