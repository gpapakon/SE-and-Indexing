<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes to dilute, under known conditions, hot air, for example that circulating in a drying oven (1), with cool air, for example external air, the humidity of which is known, in order to obtain mixed air whose characteristics are suitable for conventional humidity sensors, for example a psychrometer; and to deduce the humidity of the hot air from known dilution conditions, the known humidity of the cool air and the measured humidity of the mixed air. In order to dilute the hot air, use is preferably made of a mixer (14) comprising an enclosure (15) connected to a suction source (16).
