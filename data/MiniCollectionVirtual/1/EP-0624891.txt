<ABSTRACT>
A membrane (diaphragm) (6) is provided for an electrical switching device for indicating the consumption of a sacrificial anode in a water heater. In the event of consumption, the membrane (6) snaps over and triggers an indication via a contact body (14). In order to improve the functional reliability, an additional sealing body (10), which supports the contact body (14), is seated on the moving section of the membrane (6).

Electrical switch gear to indicate the consumption of a sacrificial anode in a hot water 
heater, where a membrane is installed in a measuring room which is connected to an interior 

room of the sacrificial anode, this membrane seals off a contact chamber which houses 
switching contacts which can be connected using contact bodies which can be moved by one 

lift of the membrane which activates the switch.
 
This is characterised by the fact that a sealing body (10) sits on the movable section of the 

membrane (6) which carries the contact body (14), whereby the sealing body (10) seals the 
contact chamber (16) from the membrane (6). 
Switch gear according to patent claim 1, characterised by the fact that the sealing body (10) 
sits loosely on the membrane (6). 
Switch gear in accordance with claims 1 or 2, characterised by the fact that there is an 
intermediate chamber between a collar (12) ofthe sealing body (10) and the membrane (6), 

whereby if the membrane leaks, water enters this chamber and moves the sealing body in such 
a way that the contact body (14) hits the switch contacts (17, 18). 
Switch gear in accordance to one of the above claims, characterised by the fact that the 
sealing body (10) has a pressure plate (11) and a collar (12). 
Switch gear in accordance with patent claim 4, characterised by the fact that the sealing 
body (10) is made of one piece. 
Switch gear in accordance with one of the above claims, characterised by the fact that the 
collar (12) is positioned in such a way that water flowing in supports its sealing functions.
