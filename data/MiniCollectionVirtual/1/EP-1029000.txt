<DESCRIPTION>
 CRYSTA U2ATION RESISTANT AMIDOAMINE COMPOSITIONSField of the InventionThis invention relates to amidoamine compositions and their uses, including as epoxy curing agents.•• l 'background of the InventionAmine functional epoxy curing agents made by condensing fatty acids and various amines are well Known in the art and are described in U.S. Patent Nos 2 705,223, 2,811,495. and 2,899,397, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other polyamine-epoxy 20 adducts useful as curing agents are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,651.589, 2,854,775, and 4,116,900, the disclosures of which also are hereby incorporated by reference. Lower viscosity, amidoaminβ resins have conventionally been made primarily from blends of monomeric and dimeric fatty acids and commercial tetraethylenβpentamine (TEPA). Commercially 25 available products of this type are Genamid® 747 and Genamid® 151 byHeπkel Corp., Gulph Mills, PA.Amidoamines made solely from triethylenetetraamine (TETA) as the amine component are subject to partial to complete crystallization or solidification ("titβr"). To prevent such crystallization of these amidoamines, 30 a significant amount of dimeric fatty acid muβt be included, and/or high levels of imidazoline rings must be formed. High levels of dimer acid can unacceptably crease viscosity of the amidoamines; high levels of imidazolme rings slow their reactivity. Nevertheless, amidoamine curing 

 agents όased" on TETA are more desirable because TETA ϊs a low cost amine compared to TEPA. Attempts to prepare epoxy curing amidoamines using TETA have required the use of significant levels of dimer acid with tall oil fatty acid (TOFA) and/or high imidazoline/amido amine ("IA/AA") ratio, o which either gives high viscosity or low reactivity respectively.Summary of the inventionThe present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by enabling the preparation of crystallization or solidification resistant 0 amidoamines based on TETA that exhibit high reactivity with epoxies while remaining a liquid of acceptable viscosity at ambient temperatures.The invention relates to amidoamine compositions, which comprise the reaction product of at Ieast one aliphatic monobasic carboxylic acid, triethylenetetraamine and an amine selected from the group consisting of 15 homologs of polyethylenepolyamines higher than triethylenetetraamine, cyclic polyamines, and mixtures thereof, their method of use, and cured epoxy compositions made with them.Within these formulations, the inclusion of sufficient
