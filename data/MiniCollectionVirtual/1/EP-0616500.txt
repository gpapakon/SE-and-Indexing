<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support (1) for fitting shelf bases and the like, consisting of at least three vertical rods (3a, 3b, 3c), two of which are joined together by butt-welded horizontal connectors (5) in such a way as to form a ladder-like bearing section (2), at least one other rod (3c) being joined to the bearing section (2) by at least one supporting way (6) via a plurality of spot welds (8). The essence of the invention lies in the fact that at least one supporting stay (6) is welded to the connectors (5).

A support (1) for mounting shelves and the like, comprising 
at least three vertical bars (3a, 3b, 3c), two (3a, 3b) of whi
ch 
are butt-welded together by means of horizontally arranged 

connecting members (5) in such a manner that a ladder-type 
supporting part (2) is formed, wherein the at least one 

further bar (3c) is connected to the ladder-type supporting 
part (2) by at least one supporting strut (6) by means of a 

plurality of individual welds (8), characterised in that the at 
least one supporting strut (6) is welded to the connecting 

members (5). 
A support according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
welds (8), required for connecting the at least one 

supporting strut (6) to the connecting members (5), are 
formed by part of the turns (7) of the supporting struts (6). 
A support according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the at least one supporting strut (6) is arranged at right 

angles to the connecting members (5). 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the at least one supporting strut (6) is 

arranged either centrally and/or eccentrically to the bars 
(3a, 3b). 
A support according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the bars (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d) are arranged crosswise viewed 

from above, and a supporting strut (6) is arranged on either 
side of the connecting members (5).
