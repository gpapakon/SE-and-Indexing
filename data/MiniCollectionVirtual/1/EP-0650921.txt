<ABSTRACT>
A lift truck with a mast (1) of the industrial or semi-industrial type includes a chassis, driving front wheels (2), guiding rear wheels (3), a combustion engine (4), a driver's position (8) located between the front wheels (2) and rear wheels (3) over the entire width of the truck. The driver's seat (7) is located so as to allow access from either side of the driver's position (8), the driving front wheels (2) are driven by hydraulic motors (6) connected by hoses to a hydrostatic pump (5) driven by the combustion engine (4). The pedal-operated gear (10) is located at least partially in the region of and in immmediate proximity to the axis (A) of rotation of the front wheels (2). The combustion engine (4) is placed behind the driver's seat (7). The seat part of the driver's seat (7) is located at a lower level (16) than the top of the combustion engine (4).

An industrial or semi-industrial short wheel base lift truck 
comprising a chassis (12), front driving wheels (2), rear steerable wheels 

(3), a thermal motor (4), a driver's station disposed between the front and 
rear wheels over the whole width of the track and in which the driver's 

seat (7) is disposed so as to permit access a either side of the driver's 
post, the front driven wheels being driven by hydraulic wheel motors 

connected by flexible pipes to a hydrostatic pump (5) driven by the 
thermal motor, characterised in that the chassis (12) has an upwardly 

open configuration between the front driving wheels (2) so as to define a 
volume within which is disposed at least partially the control pedal 

assembly (10) and in that the hydraulic motors of the front wheels are 
fixed to the aforesaid configuration at either side of the aforesaid volume. 
A short wheel base truck according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the thermal motor (4) is placed behind the driver's seat (7). 
A short wheel base truck according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the upper plane of the casing (16) upon which the driver's seat (7) 

rests is situated substantially below the upper part of the thermal motor 
(4). 
A truck according to Claim 1, characterised in that the thermal 
motor (4) is disposed longitudinally and the driving seat (7) is situated 

above the hydrostatic pump (5).  
 
A truck according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
chassis (12), in section, is in the form of an upwardly open C. 
A truck according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the floor (15) of the driving station rests on the upper part of the 

chassis (12). 
A truck according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the floor (15) is disposed at a height of less than 550 mm above the 

ground. 
A truck according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the driving station is constituted by a forwardly tiltable cabin (8). 
A truck according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the pedal assembly (10) is mounted in a removable housing 

containing the connections of hydraulic safety devices (18, 19, 20, 21, 
22, 23), the housing being fixed in an opening of the floor (15).
