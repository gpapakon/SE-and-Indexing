<ABSTRACT>
The colorimetric measuring head (1), for determining the internal colour of a non-opaque material (2), in particular the internal colour of human skin, includes an optical system (3) which emits light towards the material to be studied and is separated by an oblique wall (4) for an optical system (5) which receives the light which has penetrated into and been reflected by the material. The external surface (A) of the head (1), which faces the material to be studied, is continuous and adapted to the surface of the material so as to match this surface either by direct application against the said surface of the material or with an optical wetting medium. The assembly is such that the light (R) received by the detector comes from inside the material (2), whilst the light possibly reflected by the surface of the material or coming directly from the emitter cannot reach the detector because of the opaque separating wall.

Colorimetric measurement head, for determining

the internal colour of a non-opaque material, in
particular the internal colour of the human skin,

including an optical system (503) which emits light
towards the material to be studied and is separated by

an opaque wall (504) from an optical system (505) which
receives light which has penetrated into the material

and which is reflected thereby, the external surface (A)
of the head, which is turned towards the material (2) to

be studied, being continuous and adapted to the surface
of the material so as to match this surface,

characterized in that it includes an outer opaque wall
(506) which slides between a projecting position for

allowing conventional surface colour measurement, and a
retracted position in which the end of the opaque wall

(506) is located on the continuous surface (A) of the
end of the head, so as to be applied against the

material and to allow measurement of the internal colour
of this non-opaque material.
Head according to Claim 1, characterized in that
it is surrounded by an opaque wall (506) protecting the

head against stray external light.
Head according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the emitter (3
a
) is capable of emitting a parallel
light beam.
Head according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the emitter (3
b
, 103) emits diffuse light.
Head according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the detector (405) provides

multidirectional detection.
Head according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the receiver comprises an integration sphere (405).
Head according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the detector (205, 305) provides collimated

detection.
Head according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
it includes a collimated system (C) which comprises, at

the level of the detector (305), a converging lens (A)
whose front face is in the plane (A) of the head (301)

which is intended to be applied against the material, a
screen (9) being arranged with an aperture (10) at its

centre, located at the focus of the lens (8), a
detection cell (11) being placed behind the

aperture (10).
Method for determining the internal colour of a
non-opaque material, characterized in that a

colorimetric measurement head (1, 101, 201, 301, 401,
501) having a surface (A) which matches the surface of

the material is applied against this material, the
measurement head including a light emitter (3, 103,

203, 303, 403, 503) separated from a receiver (5, 105,
205, 305, 405, 505) by an opaque wall (4, 104,

204, 304, 304, 404, 504) and an outer opaque wall (506)
which slides between a projecting position for allowing

conventional surface colour measurement, and a
retracted position in which the end of the opaque wall

(506) is located on the continuous surface (A) of the
end of the head, so as to be applied against the

material and to allow measurement of the internal
colour of this non-opaque material.
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the outer surface (A) of the head matches the

surface of the material to be studied either by direct
application against the said surface of the material,

or by an optical wetting.
