<ABSTRACT>
An audio signal recording apparatus is constructed to 
record a track number signal which allows the recording 

of an index number signal indicating a pause portion 
before a music piece also at the beginning of the 

recording operation. An audio signal (Sa) to be recorded 
is delayed by a predetermined time period (T‚ÇÅ), to 

produce a delayed audio signal (Sb). Upon starting the 
recording operation, a muting operation is effected to 

the delayed audio signal and a resultant signal (Sd) is 
recorded on the recording medium during the predetermined 

time period after the start of the recording. During 
this period, a subcode information signal containing the 

index number signal indicating a number "0" is also 
recorded on the recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus for recording an audio signal.In the recording of music software produced by using
a recording medium such as a CD (Compact Disc), an MD
(Mini Disc), and a DAT (Digital Audio Tape), it is
general to record, as components of subcode information,
a music piece number signal representing a music number
and an index number signal representing the number of
each measure (fragment) of a music piece, besides the
audio signal corresponding to each music piece.European Patent Application No. EP-A-0480682 discloses
an audio signal recording system which derives a subcode
from a format signal which is recorded onto a recording
medium. The new subcode is derived from an original subcode
which is separated from a change in programme number and a
sound volume level. By detecting both the format signal and
the sound volume level 9 more accurate detection of changes
between dubbed programmes is possible and also enables the
provision of the new subcode. In a playing apparatus, such as a CD player, for
playing back the recorded music software, the track
number signal is retrieved from the subcode information,
besides the retrieval of the audio signal from the
recording medium so that the music piece number is
identified and a fast access to the head part of a
desired music piece is enabled by using the retrieved
track number signal. Furthermore, by using the index
number signal retrieved from the subcode information,
measures existing in one music piece are identified, and 
the access to a head part to a desired measure of the
music piece is enabled. The index number signal has a
value "0" for a silent portion of the music signal, i.e.
an intervening pause between tracks (music pieces), and
is set to a value "1" upon starting of the first
measure. Thereafter, the index number signal is
incremented by one each time a change of the measure in
the music piece occurs. Most CD players are designed to
perform an index search operation in such a way that a
change position of the index number signal is detected in
response to the user's index search instruction and the
head portion of the arbitrarily selected measure of the
music piece is searched for by using such a change
position.Therefore, in a recording apparatus for the dubbing
of music pieces from music software recorded on the
above-described recording medium, such as an apparatus
using a CD-R (Compact Disc Recordable), the subcode
information containing the track number signal and the
index number signal is

<CLAIMS>
A recording apparatus for recording a CD format
audio signal corresponding to at least one music piece on

a recording medium (25a), comprising:

delay means (21) for delaying said audio signal (Sa)
by a first predetermined time period (T1), and producing

a delayed audio signal (Sb);
muting means (23) for producing a muting output
signal (Sd) by providing a silent signal for a second

predetermined period (T2) which is slightly shorter than
or equal to said first predetermined period (T1) from

when said delay means (21) receives the start of said at
least one music piece, and after said second

predetermined period has elapsed, providing said delayed
audio signal (Sb) itself as said muting output signal

(Sd), and outputting said muting output signal (Sd);
means (29) for generating a subcode signal (Se)
containing an index number signal representing an index

number "0" for said second predetermined period (T2)
after the start of recording and changing said index

number signal to an index number "1" at the end of said
second predetermined period (T2); and 
recording means (24, 25c) for recording on said
recording medium (25a) a CD format signal produced from

a combined signal of said muting output signal (Sd) as
a main code signal and said subcode signal (Se)
