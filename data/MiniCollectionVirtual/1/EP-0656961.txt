<ABSTRACT>
An improved wiped film evaporator (WFE) process for removing low molecular weight species from a hydrocarbyl mixture is disclosed, wherein partial oxidation of a hydrocarbyl mixture precedes the WFE step. Faster rates of distillation are achieved without significant deterioration of hydrocarbyl product properties. Such products can include carbon fiber precursor materials. Similar faster rates are provided by adding higher softening point hydrocarbyl materials with or without prior partial oxidation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention broadly relates to distillation of pitch-like 
materials. But more particularly, this invention relates to 
pitch-like materials comprising a mixture of high and low boiling components, 
wherein the mixture has a softening point in the range 
200°F to 600°F (93 to 316°C) as determined in accordance with a modification of 
ASTM D-3461 (modified ASTM D-3461). The modifications to 
ASTM D-3461 consist of a stainless steel ball of appropriate 
dimensions instead of the lead ball, a nitrogen purge exists 
throughout the heating cell, and testing may be performed to 
temperatures > 180°C. A softening point throughout this specification and claims is 
intended to mean that temperature determined and in accordance 
with modified ASTM D-3461, unless otherwise specifically stated. Hydrocarbyl material throughout this specification 
shall mean a material having; a percent by weight of hydrogen in the 
range 4% to 16%; a percent by weight of carbon in the range of at 
least 80%, more preferably at least 85% by weight, most preferably 
at least 90% by weight; a percent by weight of nitrogen in the range  
 
0% to 3%; and a percent by weight of sulfur in the range 0% to 4%. 
The percents by weight are all based upon the total weight of the 
hydrocarbyl material. Hydrocarbyl material can be pitches derived 
from petroleum or coal tar. A WFE process for purposes of this specification and claims 
includes any process that subjects a thin film to elevated temperatures 
and reduced pressure to evolve lower molecular weight or more easily 
volatilized components from higher molecular weight or heavier 
residues. A WFE process can more narrowly involve: forming a layer 
on a heated surface while simultaneously providing a pressure in the 
range 50 to 1,000 microns of mercury (Hg) (6.6 to 133 Pa), preferably in the range 
100 to 950 microns of Hg (13.3 to 126 Pa). The temperature for the heated surface 
is generally in the range 600° F to 850°F (316 to 454°C), preferably 650°F to 800°F (343 to 427°C), 
and still more preferably 700°F to 760°F (371 to 404°C). Generally the layers have 
thicknesses in the range 0.01 to 0.1 inches (0.0254 to 0.254 cm), preferably 
0.02 to 0.05 inches (0.0508 to 0.127 cm). The letters "WFE" were selected because a 
wiped film evaporator can be used to carry out one such WFE 
process. This invention is directed to transforming 
pitch-like materials from one softening point to another so that they 
become suitable carbon fiber precursor materials. The carbon fiber 
precursor

A process for producing a higher softening point pitch-like material 
from a lower softening point pitch-like material by a WFE process; which 

comprises: adding a portion of higher softening point partially oxidized pitch-like 
material to said lower softening point pitch-like material prior to said WFE 

process in an amount sufficient to increase the WFE process rate of the partially 
oxidized lower softening point pitch-like material relative to the rate for said 

lower softening point pitch-like material alone, when all other factors that 
influence said WFE process are kept constant. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein said amount of said 
oxidized pitch-like material comprises 10% to 60% by volume of the resulting 

mixture. 
A process for producing a higher softening point pitch-like material

lower boiling components are removed by distillation; which process comprises, 
prior to said WFE process, mixing into said lower softening point pitch-like 

material an amount of said lower softening point pitch-like material which has 
been oxidized; such that the production rate for said WFE process of the mixture 

is increased relative to that of said lower softening point pitch-like material alone, 
when all other factors that influence said WFE process are kept constant; wherein

ASTM D-3461 than said lower softening point pitch-like material and wherein 

said amount of said oxidized pitch-like material comprises 10% to 60% by
