<ABSTRACT>
A sheet thickness detecting device for 
detecting the thickness of a recording member precisely 

irrespective of accuracy of parts is disclosed. A 
state that a roller 1 of a pair of rollers 1, 2 is 

positioned at a predetermined angle of rotation, is 
detected by a flag 11 fixed to the axle of the roller 1 

and a photosensor 12 for roller rotation angle 
detection. A signal from a photosensor 8 for roller 

pair axes distance detection is processed in accordance 
with a signal from the photosensor 12 to detect the 

thickness of a recording member P. In this device, the 
thickness of the recording member P is detected when 

the rollers 1, 2 are positioned at the predetermined 
angle of rotation. Thus, it can be detected accurately 

without being affected by eccentricities of the rollers 
1, 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet
thickness detecting device provided in an image forming
apparatus such as a copying machine, facsimile, etc.
for detecting the thickness of a recording member, and
more particularly to a sheet thickness detecting device
for detecting the thickness of a recording member based
on the change in distance between axes of two rollers
for feeding the recording member.Recently, image forming technique in
electrophotography and ink jet method has progressed.
Also, regarding image forming apparatuses, apparatuses
capable of forming images with full color start to be
used widely. On the other hand, regarding recording
members, various materials for forming various types of
images have been developed. Particularly, in color
image forming apparatuses, it is required to record
images on recording members having various thicknesses
since images with high appearance quality can be
obtained if much thicker papers are utilized.However, in order to maintain image quality
correspondingly to recording members having various 
thicknesses, it is necessary to optimize various
conditions in forming images.For example, in a fixing process of the
electrophotography method for heating, pressurizing,
melting and fixing toner transferred on a recording
member, as a quantity of heat required for a thin
recording member is different from that required for a
thick recording member, it is necessary to carry out
temperature control based on the thicknesses of
recording members.Also, even though recording members are formed
of the same material, if their thicknesses are
different, their volume resistivities are different.
Therefore, in order to obtain images with uniform
quality, in a transfer process, it is necessary to vary
current for driving a transfer charger based on the
thicknesses of recording members.On the other hand, in the ink jet recording
method, the distance between a recording head and a
recording member has a great influence on image
quality. In order to maintain constantly uniform image
quality, it is necessary to keep the distance between
the recording head and a surface of the recording
member constant in spite of the thickness of the
recording member.Also, since a serial scanning method is used
for forming images, it is necessary to feed a recording 
member intermittently by an amount equivalent to a
width of recording with accuracy. However, when the
rotation angle of a feed roller is constant, the
feeding amount is changed based on the thickness of the
recording member.In
