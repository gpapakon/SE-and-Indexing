<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thermally insulating 
jacket under reversible vacuum, having a heat-transfer 
coefficient which changes depending on the different 
possible situations during the usage, requiring sometimes 
a fair thermal insulation and sometimes, on the 
contrary, a rapid heat dissipation. A jacket of this kind had already been proposed 
for the insulation e.g. of a heat accumulator; see U.S. 
Patent 3,823,305. Such a jacket was consisting of an 
inner wall, an outer wall and an inner space (or inter-space 
or hollow space) between the two walls; one of 
the walls of an insulating jacket (in this case the 
inner one) has obviously to be hotter than the other. 
Said inner space was typically containing: 
(I) a reversible hydrogen getter, namely a getter 
which can release or reversibly re-adsorb minor or major 
amounts of hydrogen, depending on the temperature employed 
for heating or respectively cooling the getter; (II) a first amount of hydrogen, just chemically 
adsorbed by said getter in the solid state and depending 
on the getter temperature;  
 (III) a second amount of (free) gaseous hydrogen, 
which takes up the whole available volume inside the 
jacket; also this second amount depends on the getter 
temperature. The hotter the getter the greater the amount of 
hydrogen shifting from the adsorbed state to the free 
gaseous state; the colder the getter the lower the amount 
of free hydrogen, hence its pressure. The higher the 
hydrogen pressure the higher, within certain limits, 
the heat-transfer inside the jacket. A particular field of application of these hydrogen 
depending jackets are the electrical accumulators installed 
on the battery-driven cars, even if in a semi-experimental 
or testing phase. Such batteries, as known, are 
hot working (300-425°C) and are generally consisting 
of a couple lithium/sulphides (425°C), sodium/sulphur 
(325°) or sodium/nickel chloride (300°C). These batteries 
must quickly disperse the heat, in case of a 
overheating, which occurs, depending on the kind of 
battery, during the discharge phase, as in the case 
of the sodium/sulphur elements, or during the recharge 
phase, in the case of the lithium/sulphides batteries. Apart from these situations, which repeatedly occur, 
in a cyclical way, during the normal run of a battery, 
it is also possible to observe emergengy situations, as 
in the case e.g. of a rapid discharge or other, which 
could lead to a sudden overheating of the elements. In 
such situations it is equally important to have an
