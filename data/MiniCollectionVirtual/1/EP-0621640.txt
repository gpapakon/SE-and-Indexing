<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor power device is specified which comprises means which enable a significant reduction in the thickness of the semiconductor substrate (1), at the same time optimising losses. These means comprise, in particular, a transparent emitter (6) and a stop layer (7). The means can be used both in semiconductor switches, such as IGBT, MCT or GTO, and also in diodes.
