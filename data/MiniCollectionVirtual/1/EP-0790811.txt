<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a lumen support device (10), or stent, used to open or expand a body lumen. The stent (10) incorporates elongated parallel stent components (23) with circumferential members (20), fingers, which weave into paired slots (30) of an adjacent stent component. This weave-like interlocking configuration enables the stent (10) to expand radially without yielding or plastically deforming the material of which the stent is fabricated. The weave-like mechanism allows for uniform, smooth expansion without change in longitudinal dimensions for the complete assembly. Once assembled, the plurality of parallel elongated stent components form a cylindrical configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intraluminal stent implants for maintaining
support of a body lumen. It comprises an improvement and alternate design to stents
which are generally cylindrical in shape and have a plurality of metal elements
joined to permit flexing of the stent along the longitudinal axis allowing it to
conform to the curves of the inner wall of the targeted lumen.An important use of metal stents is found in situations where part of
the vessel wall or stenotic plaque blocks or occludes blood flow in the vessel.
Normally a balloon catheter is utilized in a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty (PTCA) procedure to enlarge the occluded portion of the vessel.
However, the dilation of the occlusion can form flaps, fissures and dissections which
threaten re-closure of the dilated vessel or even perforations in the vessel wall.
Implantation of stents can provide support for such problems and prevent reclosure
of the vessel or provide patch repair for a perforated vessel. The stent overcomes
the natural tenancy of the vessel walls of some patients to collapse, thereby
maintaining a more normal flow of blood through that vessel than would be possible
if the slant were not in place.An example of prior developed metal stents has been described in the
article of Stignart, et al. titled "Intravascular Stents To prevent Occlusion and
Restenosis after Transluminal Angioplasty", published in the New England Journal
of Medicine, Vol. 316, No. 12, Mar. 19, 1981, pages 701-706. This stent is the
form of a "Chinese finger handcuff" metallic mesh which can be expanded and
compressed in diameter. The stent is made by cutting desired lengths from an
elongated tube of metal mesh and, accordingly, has the disadvantage that metal
prongs from the cutting process remain at the longitudinal ends thereof. The inherent
rigidity of the metal used to form the stent together with these terminal prongs make
navigation of the blood vessels to the locus of the lesion difficult as well as risky
from the standpoint of injury to healthy tissue along the passage to the target vessel.
When the stent is permanently placed in a vessel, the continuous stress from the
flow of the fluid within the vessel could cause the prongs to damage the vessel walls
adjacent to the lesion. Another type of metal stent involves a tube of stainless wire braid.
During insertion, the tube is positioned along a delivery device, such as a catheter,
in extended form, making the tube diameter as small as possible. When the stent is
positioned across
