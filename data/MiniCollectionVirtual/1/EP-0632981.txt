<ABSTRACT>
A coupling device for coupling a mattress (2) to a 
mattress base (1) comprises a lower coupling element (4), 

which can be attached to the mattress base (1), and an upper 
coupling element (6), which can be attached to the mattress 

(2), which lower coupling element (4) and upper coupling 
element (6) can be mechanically connected to one another. To 

facilitate the making of said connection, said upper coupling 
element (6) and lower coupling element (4) can be coupled in 

various positions which are offset with respect to one 
another. Furthermore, upper coupling element (6) and lower 

coupling element (4) can also be coupled electrically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a coupling device a mattress to a 
mattress base, comprising a lower coupling element, which can be 
attached to the mattress base, and an upper coupling element, which 
can be attached to the mattress, which lower coupling element and 
upper coupling element can be mechanically coupled to one another. Such a coupling device is known from US-A-2,995,762. The 
advantage is that the mattress is held in place with respect to the 
mattress base. This is particularly important in the case of 
mattresses which have an adjustable head and/or foot end. With 
mattresses of this type, a mattress which is lying loose on the base 
can easily shift, whilst it also follows the movements of the mattress 
base less well. The aim of the invention is to provide a coupling device, of the 
type described above, which is more versatile and which can easily be 
fixed in several positions. This aim is achieved in that one of the 
coupling elements comprises at least one protrusion having a constant 
cross-section in its longitudinal direction, and the other coupling 
element comprises at least two cavities located alongside one another, 
such that the protrusion can be accommodated in various positions, 
offset in its longitudinal direction, in any of the cavities.  
 The coupling elements can be attached to one another 
in various ways. A user-friendly type of connection is the 
snap fastening, where both coupling elements carry 
protrusions, of which at least the protrusions on one of the 
coupling elements form an undercut cavity into which the 
protrusions on the other coupling element can be hooked. The known coupling devices also have the disadvantage 
that the two coupling elements have to be accurately 
positioned opposite one another before they can be made to 
interact. It is therefore desirable, with a view to further 
improvement in user-friendliness and versatility, to 
construct the coupling device in such a way that the latter 
is also capable of producing a coupling when the two coupling 
elements are less accurately positioned with respect to one 
another. To this end, one of the coupling elements comprises 
a multiplicity of undercut cavities which in the transverse 
direction are located alongside one another and which each 
have a constant cross-section in the longitudinal direction,  
 
and the other coupling element comprises a rib which has a 
widened top and likewise has a constant cross-section in the 
longitudinal direction. On the one hand, the rib can still be
