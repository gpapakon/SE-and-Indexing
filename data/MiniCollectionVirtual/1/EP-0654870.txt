<ABSTRACT>
A receptacle connector (12) for an IC card (10) 
is provided for mounting on a surface of a circuit 

substrate (14). The connector includes a dielectric 
housing (40) having a forward mating face (42), a rearward 

terminating face (43), and a plurality of terminal-receiving 
passages (44)) extending therethrough. A 

plurality of conductive terminals (16) are received in the 
passages. Each terminal includes a surface mount tail 

portion (50) projecting from the rearward terminating face 
of the housing which includes a contact portion (52) for 

resiliently engaging an appropriate circuit trace (18) on 
the substrate. The contact portions are disposed in a 

generally coplanar elongate array. A mounting arm (46) is 
provided at each end of the housing for mounting the 

connector on the surface of the substrate. A pair of 
generally rectangularly configured mounting pegs (54) 

projects from a bottom mounting face of each mounting arm. 
Each pair of pegs "straddles" the elongated array of 

contact portions and is adapted to provide an interference 
fit within a corresponding mounting hole (56) in the 

circuit substrate to hold the connector to the substrate 
during processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector for
mounting at an edge of a circuit substrate.An electrical connector of that kind is known from
DE-U-86 30 076 and has three rows of terminals at the
forward mating face which form three rows of mount contact
portions at the rearward terminating face. There are also
two mounting pegs on each lateral side of the connector,
which straddle the contact portions of the lowermost
terminal row only, whereas the middle and uppermost terminal
rows have their contact portions arranged between
corresponding mounting pegs and rearwardly thereof,
respectively.Mounting pegs having partly round cross-sections are
known from GB-A-2,268,003 with four flat side surfaces and
four rounded side surfaces. The area of the rounded side
surfaces is relatively large so that the problem of reducing
manufacturing tolerances is not solved by such a mounting
peg.A surface mount connector having two different shaped
terminals is known from GB-A-2,256,755. The terminals are
arranged in two passages, one above the other, and terminate
result in a single elongate array of contacts to be mounted
to the traces of the circuit board. The connector housing
has ends with respective arms each having a pair of pegs.
The pegs serve fixing purposes during soldering of the
contacts. The second peg of the pair is a pin arranged in
the row of contacts and is soldered to the circuit board in
the same way as the contacts of the terminals. There is no
straddle effect from the pegs to the row of contacts. A pair of pegs at flanges of connector housing is
known from EP-A-0 182 070. The type of terminals and their
arrangement is not mentioned.Generally, IC cards or packs, such as memory cards,
are data input devices which are electrically connected to
an underlying electronic apparatus or storage device, such
as a word processor, personal computer or other electronic
apparatus. Upon insertion of the IC card into the underlying
apparatus and electrical connection thereto, the data stored
in the IC card is transferred to the electronic apparatus.
The IC or memory cards are typically portable instruments
which may be readily inserted and extracted from a connector
apparatus as required, and are used with such connector
apparatus for removably coupling the card to a printed
circuit board of the underlying apparatus, for instance.An IC card conventionally includes a rectangular
frame which receives a circuit substrate, and on or around
which is mounted a panel or cover that encloses the circuit
substrate

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (12) for mounting at an edge of
a curcuit substrate (14) which has a top surface (20)

with surface contact means (18, 24) thereon, including:

a dielectric housing (40) having a forward mating
face (42), a rearward terminating face (43) and a

plurality of terminal-receiving passages (44) arranged
one upon the other and extending between the forward

mating face and the rearward terminating face;
a plurality of conductive terminals (16) received
in the passages (44), each including a surface mount

tail portion (50) projecting from the rearward
terminating face (43) of the housing (40) and extending

outwardly therefrom, each surface mount tail portion
(50) having a surface mount contact portion (52)

projecting in unstressed condition below said top
surface (20) of the substrate (14) for resiliently

engaging said surface contact means (18, 27),
a first integrally molded mounting peg (54)
projecting from a bottom mounting face (47) for

insertion into a first corresponding mounting hole (56)
in the curcuit substrate (14);
a second integrally molded mounting peg (54)
projecting from the bottom mounting face (47) for

inserting into a second corresponding mounting hole (56)
in the circuit substrate (14);

characterized in that
the housing (40) further includes a mounting arm
(46) on each end thereof for mounting on said top

surface (20) of the substrate (14);
in that only two rows of passages (44) and
terminals (16) are provided, the surface mount tails 

(50) of one terminal row having configurations different
to the configurations of the other terminal row,
in that the surface mount contact portions (52) of
both terminal rows define a single elongate array

between the mounting arms (46); and
in that the first mounting peg (54) is positioned
forward of the elongate array of surface mount contact

portions (52) whereas the second mounting peg (54) is
positioned rearward of the elongate array,
so that the first and second mounting pegs (54)
straddle the elongate array of surface mount contact

portions (52).
The electrical connector as set forth in claim 1,
wherein the mounting pegs have a generally rectangular-shaped

cross-section.
The electrical connector as set forth in claim 2,
wherein the mounting pegs have a generally square-shaped

cross-section.
The electrical connector as set forth in claim 2 or 3,
wherein the mounting hole (56) is a round hole, and

each mounting peg (54) has a transverse dimension
between diagonal corners (60) which is greater than the

diameter of the holes (56) so as to provide an
interference fit between peg (54) and hole (56).
