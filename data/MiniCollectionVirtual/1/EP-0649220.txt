<ABSTRACT>
An auto-correlation filter is described for improving the 
signal-to-noise ratio in a signal having both analogue 

components to be detected and asynchronous noise 
components. Capable of continuous real time operation 

without the use of digital signal processing, the filter 
has an input (12) accepting a plurality of input cycles. 

A sample and hold unit (16) digitizes both the analogue 
and noise components of the signal, storing the resultant 

value for a given time period and converting this value 
into a restored analog value. A summing unit (14) then 

sums this value with the signal and noise components of 
the next cycle. When such summation is performed over a 

large number of cycles, the noise component of the signal 
averages out to near zero level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to auto-correlation 
filters. More particularly, the invention relates to auto-correlation 
filters that can operate in a continuous real-time 
manner. Auto-correlation filters are known and operate on the 
basic principle that synchronous signals can be discriminated 
from asynchronous signals or noise by summing repeated cycles 
of the signal. When such summation is performed over a 
relatively large number of cycles, the asynchronous signals 
average out to near zero, while the synchronous signal of 
interest remains at its average level. As an example, ultrasonic sensor systems that use echo 
ranging produce output signals that include a true target echo 
and random noise signals and false echoes. In many cases, 
such as a liquid level sensor for example, a large number of 
transmit/receive cycles can be performed and the true echoes 
are substantially synchronous with each other, but may be 
small in magnitude compared to associated random noise from 
the system. Use of an auto-correlation filter can 
substantially improve the output signal-to-noise ratio. Known auto-correlation filters typically operate on the 
basis of digital signal processing under the control of a 
microprocessor. The analog signals are digitized and then 
stored in digital memory devices. The multiple signals are 
then processed in digital form because of the need to retain 
the data for purposes of averaging. Such digital signal 
processing has numerous drawbacks. One drawback is that such 
signal processing demands high power digital processing 
usually realized with complicated software and a 
microprocessor controller. The use of digital memory storage 
also limits the ability to operate the filter in a real-time 
mode because the system must sample and store a number of data 
cycles and then interrupt data collection in order to perform  
 
the digital signal processing. After the auto-correlation 
process is completed, data collection is started over. The objective exists, therefore, for auto-correlation 
filtering methods and apparatus that can operate in continuous 
real time without using microprocessor control circuits or 
other digital signal processing. In response to the aforementioned objectives, the present 
invention contemplates in one embodiment an auto-correlation 
filter for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in a signal 
having synchronous analog components to be detected and 
associated asynchronous components comprising: means for 
inputting a plurality of cycles of the
