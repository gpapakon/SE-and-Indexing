<ABSTRACT>
A paper pulp screen construction including a housing for receiving a flow 
of paper stock to be screened with a cylindrical screen therein and a rotor 

movable past the screen plate with the screen plate formed in multiple layers 
and the layers shaped in undulations, in one form with smaller holes in a screen

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in pulp preparation 
apparatuses, and more particularly to apparatus for screening wood pulp to pass 
clean fibers and reject undesirable elements. In processing wood pulp, screens are utilized to separate acceptable fiber 
from undesirable constituents in a slurry. In a typical screening structure, a 
housing is provided with an inlet for pulp slurry which may have been prepared 
by cooking wood chips or by repulping secondary pulp fibers, so that the wood 
fibers are suspended in a slurry. The slurry may include undesirable elements, 
such as knots, shives, particles of bark, dirt and other undesirable constituents. Within the screen housing, the slurry flows adjacent a cylindrical screen, 
often referred to as a plate or basket, with the acceptable fibers flowing through 
the screen plate and the undesirable material remaining on the first side of the 
screen plate to flow out of a reject opening in the housing. A rotor having pulse 
or turbulence generating structures normally is moved past the surface of the 
screen plate, to enhance the flow of slurry through the screen plate, and 
enhance the screening operation. The screen has openings which are formed in 
the shape of holes or slots of a size required for the screening operation and in 
combinations for optimizing screening performance. The screen plate must have 
screening openings of the proper size to pass the acceptable fibers and to 
prevent passage of the undesirable materials. Yet, with the necessity of these 
small openings, the screen plate must have sufficient strength to withstand the  
 
pressure differential across the surface, particularly when an arrangement is 
provided where pulsations are caused by moving members along the surface of 
the screen. Different manufacturing processes have involved machining the screen 
plates, which is a relatively time consuming and expensive process. A 
construction has been proposed which involves shaping the screen without 
expensive machining. This construction is disclosed in U.S. patent 4,954,249 
wherein the screen is formed of a flat material shaped in an undulating shape to 
increase the amount of screening surface exposed to the stock, and to 
strengthen the screen against pressure differential across the screening surface. 
Rings and tie members complete the modular construction. An object of the present invention is to provide still further improvements 
in screen plates which reduce manufacturing costs and yet provide a screening 
structur
