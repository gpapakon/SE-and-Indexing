<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of coding character colours in a video system comprising a character generator, the models of these characters including at least two regions, the said method being characterised in that a colour attribute, the level of which is higher than the page level, is used to determine the colour of all the regions of all the characters corresponding to this level, the luminance values chosen for each of the regions of the characters being such that, for a given character, these regions can be distinguished when they are of the same colour. The invention applies in the television field.

Process for coding the colors of characters in a video system, which

includes a character generator making use of character models each
comprising at least two zones, said process being characterized in that a

chosen color attribute having an attribute level higher than page level is
substituted for color attributes of all the zones of all the characters

corresponding to said attribute level, the luminance values chosen for each
zones of these characters being such that, for a given character, these zones

can be visually distinguished when they are of the same color.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that said chosen color
attribute is an attribute of the highest level.
Process according to one of the preceding claims , characterized in that
said chosen color attribute is an attribute defining the color of the character

foreground, the foreground being one of said zones.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
said process is applied when video signals must be coded according to a

standard whose chrominance pass-band width is such that visible
chrominance defects may occur.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that said process is applied
when said video signals are SVHS video signals or PAL, NTSC or SECAM

composite video base-band signals.
Device making use of the process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises :


a) a RAM (12) for storing a text comprising said characters to be displayed
with at least values of the color attribute of highest level;
b) a ROM (13) including the character models and receiving the code of a
given character;
c) a color circuit (14) generating an insertion signal (FB) and producing a
video signal with color components (RGB) of said text from said character

models output from said ROM and, for each zone of one given model, from an
associated color attribute; 
d) a luminance generator (15) generating a luminance signal (Y)
corresponding to luminance of said text from said character models output

from said ROM and from luminance thresholds associated to different zones
of said character models, in order that the zones of a character displayed in

monochrome can be visually distinguished;
e) a coder (19) generating a chrominance signal (C) from said video signal
with color components; and
f) an insertion circuit inserting the luminance (Y) and/or chrominance (C)
signals into an input video signal or replacing this input video signal by the

sum of the luminance and chrominance signals;
g) a multiplex circuit (23) selecting for each zone of said character models
considered by the color circuit, the associated color attribute and providing

this color attribute to the color circuit, the multiplex circuit having a processing
mode for providing said color circuit with the same said chosen color attribute

for each zones of a considered character model.
