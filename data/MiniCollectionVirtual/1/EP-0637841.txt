<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reliable and 
low-cost semiconductor device, or more in particular to 
an IC (Integrated Circuit) card or a multichip module. Conventional techniques for IC cards are 
described in "Information Processing Handbook", first 
edition, pp. 302-304, compiled by Information Processing 
Society of Japan and published by Ohm, May 30, 1989. The 
same reference contains at pp. 242-244 also the description 
of techniques for packaging the IC card. The 
structure of IC cards is described in "IC Cards", first 
edition, p. 33, compiled by The Institute of Electronics, 
Information and Communication Engineers and published by 
Ohm, May 25, 1990. Also, an IC card using a thin LSI is 
disclosed in JP-A-3-87299, April 12, 1991. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are sectional views showing 
configurations of IC cards. In Fig. 1 showing a conventional IC card 
configuration, a chip 211 is bonded to a portion having a 
contact 210, connected to a printed board 212 by a bonding 
wire 216, and sealed by resin 215. This module is 
embedded in a center core 213 of a hard material. The 
card surface is covered with an oversheet 209 and an 
oversheet 214. Fig. 2 shows another example of the prior art.  
 
A semiconductor chip is bonded to a substrate 207 by a 
adhesive agent 207a. Due to a thick silicon substrate 
217, however, the semiconductor is connected by being 
bonded to the substrate 207 by the adhesive 207a while 
absorbing the unevenness through a bonding wire 218. In the example shown in Fig. 3, an IC 6 has a 
great thickness of about 200 to 400 µm. This bulk IC 6 
is bonded to a card board 8 by an adhesive 7. Since the 
bulk IC is thick, however, the uneven wiring patterns on 
the IC and a substrate wiring 10 are connected by a wire 
bonding 9. In this case, the bulk IC is easily subjected 
to bending stress and therefore stress relaxation is 
required. Also, in view of the limited sizes of the bulk 
IC, the structural requirement for improving the bending 
strength and the difficulty of reducing the number of 
wire-adhesive steps, the cost tends to increase. JP-A-3-87299 (April 12, 1991) has rendered well 
known an IC card configuration in which an IC module 
having a very thin LSI ground very thin leaving active 
elements is fitted in a surface recess. This conventional configuration is shown in 
Fig. 4. A semiconductor element 204 is bonded on a 
substrate 207 by an adhesive 207a. A wiring 208 for 
connecting semiconductor elements is connected to a 
conductive pad 202 by way of a through hole
