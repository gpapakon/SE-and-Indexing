<ABSTRACT>
An amplifier arrangement comprising a plurality of similar amplifier stages 
to which input signal voltages are applied in common, the output signal voltages 

being summed to retain bandwidth at the expense of gain compared with cascaded 
stages. The individual stages of the arrangement may be cascoded amplifier 

stages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amplifier arrangement, and in particular to 
amplifier arrangements comprising a plurality of amplifier stages. According to one aspect of the present invention an amplifier arrangement 
comprises a plurality of amplifier stages to which input signal voltages are applied in 
common and means to sum the output signal voltages of said amplifier stages. According to another aspect of the present invention an amplifier arrangement 
comprises at least two amplifier stages to which input signal voltages are applied in 
common and output load means, output signal voltages from one of said two amplifier 
stages being arranged to be developed at one terminal of said load means and output signal 
voltages from the other of said two amplifier stages being arranged to be developed across 
said load means, whereby the sum of said output signals is developed at the other terminal 
of said load means. Each of said amplifier stages may comprise one half of a respective long tail pair 
stage to respective inputs of which said input signal voltages are applied in antiphase, said 
output signal voltages being derived in antiphase from respective output load means. Amplifier arrangements in accordance with the present invention will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:- 
Figure 1 shows an amplifier arrangement schematically, and Figure 2 shows another arrangement diagrammatically. Referring to Figure 1, a plurality of amplifier stages A1, A2, A3 receiving input  
 
signals in common each provide voltage gain with a given bandwidth, and their output 
signals are summed. The overall voltage gain Gv of the arrangement may be represented 
as:- 
   - where f(Σ) is the transfer function of the summing block, Ai are the mid-band 
gains of the amplifiers A1, A2 etc., and ti are time constants of the amplifiers related 
to their bandwidths. In the case of cascaded amplifiers stages the overall transfer function would be:- 
It can be seen that the overall bandwidth achieved with the cascaded amplifier 
stages is lower than that achieved from gain summing. Referring to Figure 2, a summing arrangement for two amplifier stages is shown, 
each stage comprising a cascoded long tail pair transistor amplifier. One stage is formed 
by transistors T1, T2, T9 and T10, with load resistors R1 and R8, and the other by 
transistors T4, T5, T6 and T7 with load resistors R4 and R5. Emitter followers T3 and 
T8 apply the output voltage signals from the stage comprising the
