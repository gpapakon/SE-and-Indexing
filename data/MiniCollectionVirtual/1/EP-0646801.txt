<ABSTRACT>
A testing apparatus for testing and handling a multiplicity of devices, in particular 
electronic components such as integrated circuits or boards, comprises a test executor 

with a multiplicity of hierarchical operating levels assigned to respective physical or 
logical entities. At each level except the lowest one, test level controllers (10) are 

provided which include a pre-activity sequence of tasks (12), a call (13) to a lower 
operating level, a return (14) from said lower operating level, and a post-activity 

sequence of tasks (15). At the lowest level, device test processors execute the actual 
test.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a testing apparatus and a method for testing and handling a
multiplicity of devices. More specifically, it relates to a tester for testing electronic
circuitry, particularly integrated circuits.Electronic testing equipment, such as integrated circuit or board testers. has become
more and more complex over the last decades. This is particularly due to the increased
functionality of the circuitry to be tested - e.g., latest microprocessors, RISC CPU's.
combined logic/memory IC's -, which calls for complex test procedures and high-sophisticated
tester equipment.However, there is also another aspect related to this technology. This is the demand
for an integrated tester environment, particularly under production conditions. That is.
the integrated test environment does not only include the tester itself. but also
supporting machinery, e.g., a prober or handler for automatic supply and exchange of
devices to be tested (DUT's, e.g., integrated circuits or loaded or unloaded boards).
Further, the handling machinery has to be able to deal with several physical or logical
entities, such as lots or cassettes containing DUT's, and process them in the correct
order. There are even logical or physical entities which have to be handled by the tester
itself (not by additional handling tools); a common example is a wafer containing a
multiplicity of integrated circuits (IC's) of the same kind. In the latter case, the contacts
of the test head have to be advanced from one die to the next one as soon as the first
one has been tested (or the wafer has to be advanced instead), and the correct steps have
to be taken when the complete wafer has been tested (e.g., the wafer has to be removed
and replaced with the next one).It will be understood that the sequence of operating steps to be performed is not easy
to define. Even worse, they depend completely upon the kind of device to be tested
(e.g., board, IC, or wafer), and upon the available equipment (e. g., kind of IC
handler). Thus, the manufacturer of a tester cannot provide all of the required control 
hardware and/or software to a customer; instead, the customer has to adapt the tester
himself to his specific demands. On the other hand, once all controllers for a given test
equipment have been set up. there is seldom a need for later modifications, just as the
available hardware components are not subject to frequent modification or replacement.
What may in fact be changed are the test specifications of the IC or the board, but these
are widely
