<ABSTRACT>
Device for immobilising a vertical stiffener for a railing with respect to a floor-bearing support, characterised in that the stiffener (2) has a tubular profile, the cross-section of which allows it to be fitted by sliding on a vertical rigid support (4), solidly attached to a bearing plate (3) extending substantially horizontally, this tubular stiffener including a substantially plane rear face (7) provided at its lower end with an open longitudinal recess (10) and, on each side of this recess, bearing rims (11, 12) for a clamp (13) which immobilises this stiffener against a bearing surface on the rigid support, the stiffener being locked against the support via the clamp by means of at least one lock screw (19, 20) engaging in a tapped hole (25, 26) provided in the support.

Balustrade device including at least one
vertical stiffener (2) and a rigid support (4) for

bearing on the ground, this stiffener having a tubular
profile, the cross-section of which enables it to be

fitted vertically by sliding onto the support, the
latter being fastened to a bearing mounting plate (3,

65) extending substantially horizontally or vertically,
characterized in that the tubular stiffener includes a

substantially plane rear face (7) provided at its lower
end with an open longitudinal recess (10) and, on each

side of this recess, with bearing rims (11, 12) for a
clamp (13) for immobilizing the stiffener against a

bearing surface of the rigid support, the stiffener
being locked against the support by the agency of the

clamp by means of at least one locking screw (19, 20)
acting in conjunction with a tapped bore (25, 26)

provided in the support.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the support (4) consists of a solid rigid section,

having an I-shaped or rectangular cross-section at its
base, with a central leg (21) and two tranverse legs

(23, 24), the tubular stiffener, including two side
faces (8, 9) and a front face (6) opposite its rear

face (7) which includes the recess (10), being fitted
vertically onto the section, the transverse legs of

which extend substantially perpendicularly to the side
faces of the stiffener and the height of which is

limited so that such a fitting is achieved
satisfactorily. 
Device according to Claim 2
,
 characterized in
that the stiffener (2) has a vertical plane of symmetry

which coincides with the central leg (21) of the
section of the support (4).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the immobilizing clamp (13)

consists of a small rectangular plate having a central
part (14) capable of engaging in the open recess (10)

in the stiffener (2).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it includes two superimposed

locking screws (19, 20) lying on either side of a
vertically elongate hole (27, 28) made both in the

clamp (13) and the central leg (21) of the section of
the support (4), these screws lying substantially in

the mid-plane of the stiffener.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the elongate hole is freely penetrated by a fixing

bolt (29), passing into the hole (27) in the clamp (13)
and that (28) in the central leg (21) of the section of

the support (4), in order to fix, on the opposite side
from the immobilizing clamp, a member (32) for

supporting the bottom rail (35) of the balustrade, this
support member being held against the external surface

of the front wall of the stiffener (2) independently of

the height adjustment of the latter with respect to its
rigid support, depending on the relative position of

the bolt in the mid-plane of the stiffener inside the
elongate hole.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the member (32) for supporting the bottom rail

(35) with respect to the stiffener (2) includes a
pincer-shaped projecting part (33) delimiting a groove

engaged with a projecting rim (34) of the rail which is
mounted against the stiffener and applied against its

front wall by the fixing bolt (29).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the stiffener (2) includes, in

its external surface, substantially in the vicinity of 
its rear face (7), two grooves (45, 46) extending along

vertical generatrices lying symmetrically with respect
to the mid-plane of the stiffener and reserved for the

mounting, in the manner of a clip, of the curved side
ends (47, 48) of a cover (49), masking the immobilizing

clamp (13) and the locking screws (19, 20) from the
outside, completing the visible contour of the

stiffener beyond its open longitudinal recess (10).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the lower part of the stiffener

(2) is associated in its external surface, in line with
the clearance made between the base of the stiffener

and the mounting plate (3) for bearing on the ground,
depending on their relative longitudinal position, with

a flexible finishing sleeve (37), concealing this
clearance, this sleeve being formed by a collar,

preferably made of plastic, closed up on itself.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the collar (37) comprises a rear part (38) joined

by two linkage regions (39, 40) forming hinges and
capable of being arranged on either side of the

stiffener, with two lateral arms (41, 42) extending
beyond these linkage regions, these arms being provided

at their opposite ends with a snap-in linkage in order
to close the collar on itself and to encircle the base

of the stiffener completely.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the mounting plate (3) for

bearing on the ground includes an open housing (52),
laterally offset with respect to the stiffener (2)

beyond its rear face (7), this housing including a
vertical hole (55) through which a screw (56) for

fixing the mounting plate passes freely.
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the screw (56) rests with its head (59) on a flat

washer (60), mounted in the housing (52) and including
an oblong central hole (61), capable of laterally

positioning the screw according to the angular
orientation of the washer, so as to take up any defect 

in the position of a drillhole provided in the ground
for accommodating the end of the screw.
Device according to either of Claims 11 and 12,
characterized in that the mounting plate (3) includes,

on either side of the open housing (52), auxiliary
screws (53a) penetrating the mounting plate in order to

adjust beforehand the horizontality of the latter with
respect to the ground.
Device according to one of Claims 11 to 13,
characterized in that the housing (52) is closed by a

cap (62) which ends up being fixed to the sides of this
housing.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the bearing mounting plate consists of a fixing

piece (65) mounted against the nose of a slab or the
like, this piece vertically extending the section of

the support (4) onto which the stiffener (2) fits and
including an open housing (66) accommodating a screw

(67) for fixing against the slab, this fixing screw
lying horizontally in the housing in order to end up

locking the piece against the vertical face of the
nose.
