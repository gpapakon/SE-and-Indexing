<ABSTRACT>
A laminated (multilayered) product, intended in particular for producing interior bodywork covering (lining) elements such as door panels and/or dashboards, consisting of a core (2) covered by a skin (6). According to the invention, the core (2) is made from at least one expanded monocomponent material having characteristics of rigidity and/or of absorbing mechanical strains. A further subject of the invention is the application of the laminated product to making interior lining elements of a vehicle bodywork, such as dashboards and/or door panels.

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing a laminated product (1), intended, in
particular, for making items of interior trim for a vehicle body, such as a door

panel or a dashboard, constituted by a core (2), made from an expanded
single-component material permitting rigidity and shock absorption

characteristics, the said core (2) being covered, at least partially, by a skin (6)
and provided with localised zones having a change in density, characterised

in that use is made, to form the said core (2), of a mixture of expanded
polyphenylene ether and polystyrene, or any other expanded plastic material

having characteristics of rigidity and of absorption of external mechanical
stresses, the said expanded material having variations in density in the

thickness of the core, in the area of the said localised zones, through the use
of expanded particles or beads of different densities according to their position

in the thickness of the core, in the area of the said localised zones, with a view

to providing the said laminated product with a mechanical stress absorption
gradient.
Product capable of being obtained according to the manufacturing
process of claim 1.
Laminated product according to claim 2, characterised in that the
skin (6) is made of a thermoplastic material.
Laminated product according to claim 2, characterised in that the
core (2) comprises reinforcing elements (4).
Laminated product according to claim 2, characterised in that the
core (2) comprises inclusions.
Application of the laminated product according to any one of claims 2
to 5 to the production of items of interior trim for a vehicle body such as, in

particular, dashboards and/or door panels.
