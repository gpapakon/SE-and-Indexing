<ABSTRACT>
An improved modular carriage assembly for an inkjet 
printer including: a carriage (18) with at least two 

stalls (16) molded therein for holding a plurality of 
inkjet pens (22); and a removable frame (14) insertable 

in a compartment in the carriage (18) adjacent to the 
stall (16) for holding an electrical circuit. In a 

specific embodiment the improved modular carriage 
assembly includes at least two extensions (78) molded 

onto the removable frame (14). When the removable frame 
(14) is inserted into the compartment each of the 

extensions (78) is inserted into a respective stall (16). 
The improved modular carriage assembly has reduced cost 

and is easier to assemble, align and service without the 
need for any special tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to carriage assemblies and more
particularly to carriage assemblies for multiple inkjet
pens in a color inkjet printer.Inkjet printer/plotters and desktop printers, such as
those sold by Hewlett Packard Company, offer substantial
improvements in speed over conventional X-Y plotters and
printers. Inkjet printer/plotters typically include a pen
having an array of nozzles. The pens are mounted on a
carriage which is moved across the page in successive
swaths. Each inkjet pen has heater circuits which, when
activated, cause ink to be ejected from associated nozzles.
As the pen is positioned over a given location, a jet of
ink is ejected from the nozzle to provide a pixel of ink at
a desired location. The mosaic of pixels thus created
provides a desired composite image. Inkjet technology is now well known in the art. See,
for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 4,872,027, entitled PRINTER
HAVING IDENTIFIABLE INTERCHANGEABLE HEADS, issued October
3, 1989, to W. A. Buskirk et al. and 4,965,593, entitled
PRINT QUALITY OF DOT PRINTERS, issued October 23, 1990, to
M. S. Hickman. EP-A-313205 discloses a print carriage adapted to hold
a single ink jet cartridge.Recently, full color inkjet printer/plotters and
desktop printers have been developed which comprise a
plurality of inkjet pens of diverse colors. A typical
color inkjet printer/plotter has four inkjet pens, one that
stores black ink, and three that store colored inks, e.g.,
magenta, cyan and yellow. The colors from the three color
pens are mixed to obtain any particular color.The pens are typically mounted in stalls within an
assembly which is mounted on the carriage of the
printer/plotter. The carriage assembly positions the
inkjet pens and typically holds the circuitry required for
interfacing to the heater circuits in the inkjet pens.Conventionally, a carriage assembly consists of four
pen stalls to align the inkjet pens, four pen clamps to
hold the inkjet pens in the pen stalls, a printed circuit
board having the circuitry for interfacing to the heater
circuits in the inkjet pens, and four separate flexible
circuits interconnected between the printed circuit board
and electrical contacts on the inkjet pens. Each of these
separate parts are conventionally assembled piece by piece
with screws fastening the parts individually to a housing
to form a carriage assembly. Assembly of these individual
parts is a difficult and expensive process and special
tools are required to properly align the parts. The
carriage assembly moves during printing

<CLAIMS>
A modular carriage assembly for an inkjet printer
comprising:


a carriage (18) with at least two stalls (16) molded therein
for holding a plurality of inkjet pens (22); and
a removable frame (14) having at least two extensions (78)
molded thereon which is separable from the inkjet pens (22) and

is insertable into a compartment in said carriage (18) adjacent
to said stalls (16), wherein said extensions (78) hold an

electrical circuit assembly (56) connectable to said inkjet
pens (22), wherein when said removable frame (14) is inserted

into said compartment each of said extensions (78) is inserted
into a respective stall (16).
The modular carriage assembly of claim 1 further

characterized by:

a circuit board (54) coupled to said removable frame (14)
for interfacing to the inkjet pens (22); and
an interconnect mechanism (56) coupled to the circuit board
(54) and wrapped around the extensions (78) for interconnecting

the circuit board (54) to the inkjet pens (22);

   wherein when an inkjet pen (22) is installed in a respective
stall (16), the interconnect mechanism (56) is coupled to the

inkjet pen (22).
The modular carriage assembly of claim 2 further
characterized by:


a single attachment mechanism (20) for coupling the circuit 
board (54) to the removable frame (14) and for coupling the

removable frame (14) to the compartment in the carriage (18).
The modular carriage assembly of claim 3 further
characterized by:


a unitary clamp mechanism (28) attached to the carriage (18)
for holding the inkjet pens (22) in the carriage (18).
The modular carriage assembly of claim 4 further
characterized by:


two alignment pins (46) coupled to the compartment for
vertical alignment of the removable frame (14) in the

compartment;
single wall mechanism (48) coupled to the compartment for
horizontal alignment of the removable frame (14) in the

compartment; and
a single alignment slot (70) between two of the extensions
for aligning the removable frame (14) in the compartment on the

single wall mechanism (48).
The modular carriage assembly of claim 5 further
characterized by:


alignment mechanism (64,66,108,110) for aligning the
interconnect mechanism (56) to the removable frame (14) coupled

to the removable frame (14) and to the interconnect mechanism
