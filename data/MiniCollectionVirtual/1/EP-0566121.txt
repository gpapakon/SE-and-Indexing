<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of 
producing a zinc-chromium alloy-plated steel sheet having 

excellent properties such as bare corrosion resistance, 
corrosion resistance after coating, plating adhesiveness 

and weldability. 
The method is characterized by plating the 
surface of the steel sheet using an acid plating bath 

containing zinc ion (Zn²⁺) and chromium ion (Cr³⁺) at a 
molar concentration ratio of about 0.1 ≦ Cr³⁺/(Zn²⁺ + Cr³⁺) 

≦ 0.9 in a total amount of at least about 0.5 mol/l 
within the dissolution range, and about 0.1 to 30 g/l of 

at least one nonionic organic additive having at least a 
triple bond, at a bath temperature of about 25 to 70°C 

and a pH of about 1.0 to 4.0 with a current density of 
about 50 to 200 A/dm².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing a zinc-chromium alloy-plated steel sheet having 
excellent corrosion resistance and excellent plate 
adhesion. Galvanized steel sheets are widely used as 
rust-preventive steel sheets for automobiles, household 
electric appliances, construction materials and the like. 
This is effective because since a pure zinc layer is less 
noble relative to iron of the steel sheet, the zinc layer 
has a sacrificial anticorrosion effect in that the zinc 
is first corroded in formation of plating defects such as 
pinholes or the like and portions where the matrix iron 
is exposed by processing and these portions are covered 
by corrosion products, thereby preventing rusting of the 
steel sheet. However, the zinc layer has a fault that 
because pure zinc is active, the corrosion thereof very 
rapidly develops in a corrosive environment such as a 
spray of salt water or the like. In addition, another 
possible cause of insufficient corrosion resistance is 
that since pure zinc easily produces conductive ZnO as a  
 
corrosion product, the protective effect deteriorates due 
to the presence of the corrosion product on the surface. 
An improved plating method using Zn-Ni, Zn-Fe or the like 
has been proposed in place of the pure galvanized steel 
sheet. In recent years, Zn-Cr alloy plating and a 
method of producing a Zn-Cr alloy-plated steel sheet have 
also been proposed. Methods of producing an electroplated steel 
sheet using a plating bath containing chromium are 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 57-67188, 64-55398 
and 1-309998. The method disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 57-67188 uses an electroplating bath containing 
70 to 370 g/l sulfate ion, 45 to 60 g/l nickel ion, 0.5 
to 13 g/l chromium ion and 10 to 80 g/l boric acid, the 
bath being kept at a pH value of 1.4 to 2. The amount 
of chromium contained in the plating bath used in this 
method is 1.0 wt% at most, and any anticorrosion effect 
of chromium can hardly be expected. The chromium 
content must be further increased for improving the 
corrosion resistance. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 64-55398 
discloses a method of producing a zinc-chromium-plated 
steel sheet with excellent surface quality and corrosion 
resistance, wherein plating is effected with a current 
density of at least 50 A/dm2 by using an acid plating bath  
 
containing zinc ions, trivalent chromium ions and 0.01 to 
20 g/l of polyoxyalkylene derivative. This method 
permits the Cr content in the plating to be
