<ABSTRACT>
A polyimide precursor composition which is produced 
by (i) providing a polyamide acid solution obtained by 

reacting an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component and a 
diamine component in the presence of an oxygen-containing 

solvent and (ii) subjecting said polyamide acid solution to 
heat treatment. The polyimide precursor composition 

exhibits a desirable apparent viscosity and a desirable 
thixotropic property and it excels in film forming ability, 

and because of this, it enables to form a high quality 
relief pattern film with no defect and which excels in form 

retention by way of the screen printing. 
Further, the polyimide precursor composition is 
extremely suitable for the formation of a relief pattern by 

way of the screen printing in the production of electronic, 
electric, optical, or precision devices, wherein the relief 

pattern is required to have a reduced dielectric constant 
and a reduced residual stress and to have a sufficient heat 

resistance, moisture resistance, physical strength, and 
chemical stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel polyimide
precursor compositions which exhibit good thixotropic
properties and apparent viscosity suitable for the screen
printing and excel in film-forming properties and to a
process for producing said polyimide precursor
compositions. The present invention further relates to
novel polyimide compositions obtained from said polyimide
precursor compositions and to a process for producing said
polyimide compositions.There are known a number of polyimides which can be
used as a heat resistant material. Those polyimides are
often used in such a way that they applied to the surface
of an object so as to provide a desired relief pattern. It
is known that such relief pattern may be formed by a manner
of applying a coating material of given polyimide to the 
surface of an object by means of the spin coating technique
and subjecting the resultant to wet or dry processing
whereby forming said relief pattern or another manner of
screen-printing a coating material of given polyamide to
the surface of an object while forming said relief pattern
and that, of these manners, the latter manner is the most
advantageous since the processing can be accomplished in a
relatively reduced number of steps.Now, in order to facilitate the packing efficiency of
a coating material through an opening of a patterning plate
while attaining the formation of a relief pattern on a
substrate in a desirable state in the case where the
screen-printing technique is employed, the coating material
is desired to be in the form of a Bingham fluid and to have
a thixotropic property. The coating material is desired to
be in the form of a Newtonian fluid in the case where the
spin coating technique is employed.It is known that such characteristics desired for the
coating material used in the case of employing the screen
printing technique may be attained by admixing a powdery
filler to a given Newtonian fluid such that said powdery
filler is dispersed in said Newtonian fluid. In the case of
using a varnish paste of polyamide acid or polyimide as the
coating material in the case where the screen printing
technique is employed, it is known that the foregoing 
characteristics desired for the coating material may be
attained by incorporating powder of an inorganic or organic
material into the varnish paste.However, the relief pattern formed by means of the
screen printing technique using a polyimide composition
containing powdery filler dispersed therein is inferior to
that formed by means of the spin coating
