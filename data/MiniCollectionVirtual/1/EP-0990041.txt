<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to DNA constructs suitable for gene expression in mammalian cells and which are characterized by the presence of a mammalian promoter under the control of a tet operator/repressor system. The DNA may be used as part of a system for expressing recombinant protein. In addition, the tet operator/repressor system can be used to engineer cis- and trans-destructive viruses which are capable of replicating in the presence of the tet repressor, but not in the absence of the repressor. These viruses can be used either directly in the treatment of patients with corresponding viral diseases, as vehicles for the delivery of nucleic acids that can serve as therapeutic agents and as part of vaccines designed to immunize people or animals against viral diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with compositions and methods that rely upon the tetracycline resistance (tet) operator and repressor to control transcription in mammalian cells. It encompasses methods for recombinantly producing proteins and the vectors and host cells utilized in such methods. In addition, the present invention is directed to viruses which are recombinantly engineered so that their replication is controlled by the tet operator/repressor system. These viruses may serve as vehicles for gene transfer both in vitro and in vivo; as agents for immunization; and as a means for delivering nucleic acid therapeutic agents to cells.The ability to specifically regulate transgene expression has been a central concern in molecular biology for many years. In the case of mammalian cells, the in vitro regulation of recombinant genes has most often been accomplished through the use of inducible promoters that respond to agents such as heavy metal ions (Brinster, et al., Nature 296:39-42 (1982); heat shock (Nover, in Heat Shock Response, pp. 167-220, CRC, Fla. (1991)); and hormones (Klock, et al., Nature 329:734-736 (1987)). Unfortunately, these promoters generally provide only a relatively low level of expression even in the presence of inducer and most of the inducers that have been used in vitro have unacceptable side effects in vivo.As an alternative to inducible promoters, attempts have been made to control mammalian gene expression using well-characterized prokaryotic regulatory elements. In most cases, regulatory systems have relied upon strong interactions between prokaryotic operators and repressor proteins as a means for either targeting eukaryotic transcription modulators to specific sites within a host cell genome (see e.g., Labow, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:3343-3356 (1990)) or in attempts to directly inhibit gene expression using the prokaryotic repressor (see e.g., Brown, et al., Cell 49:603-612 (1987)).In the case of prokaryotic elements associated with the tetracycline resistance (tet) operon, systems have been developed in which the tet repressor protein is fused with polypeptides known to modulate transcription in mammalian cells. The fusion protein has then been directed to specific sites by the positioning of the tet operator sequence. For example, the tet repressor has been fused to a transactivator (VP16) and targeted to a tet operator sequence positioned upstream from the promoter of a selected gene (Gussen, et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad Sci. USA 89:5547-5551 (1992); Kim, et al.,
