<ABSTRACT>
For the detection of overlapping flexible and flat items of mail in a transport path for the sequential conveyance of items of mail standing on their edges, the transport path being constructed such that at least one section of each item of mail can be moved at right angles to the conveying direction, at least one deflection element is arranged on the transport path, by means of which deflection element the movable sections of the items of mail are deflected temporarily by a predetermined amount at right angles to the conveying direction during the conveyance in the transport path. A detection device is provided to detect the presence of overlapping sections of items of mail on the basis of the recoil behaviour of the items of mail.

Apparatus for the detection of overlaps of
flexible, flat letters (D1, D2) in a transport section

(1) for the sequential conveyance of letters standing on
one of their edges, characterized in that


at least one deflection element (6, 61, 62) is
arranged on the transport section (1) by means of

which element at least one mobile letter section
of each letter is temporarily deflected by a

prescribed amount perpendicular to the conveying

direction during the conveyance in the transport
section, and
a detection device (9-11; 91, 101, 111; 92, 102,
112) is provided in order to detect the presence

of overlapping letter sections on the basis of
the spring-back behaviour of the letter sections.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that the transport section (1) has transport belts (2, 3)

between which the flat letters are guided.
Apparatus according to claims 1 - 2,
characterized in that deflection elements (61, 62) are

arranged on opposite sides of the transport section (1).
Apparatus according to Claims 1 - 3,
characterized in that the detection device has an

illumination device (11,111,112) for producing light
beams and at least two optical receivers (9, 10; 91, 101;

92, 102), the light beams being focused on the spatial
area in which the temporary deflection of the letter

sections takes place, and the optical receivers (9, 10)
are arranged along the transport section (1) in such a 

way that the incidence of light into the optical
receivers (9, 10; 91, 101; 92, 102) is simultaneously

interrupted only if letters with overlapping sections are
deflected by the prescribed amount.
Apparatus according to Claims 1 - 4,
characterized in that the optical receivers (9, 10; 91,

101; 92, 102) are arranged on opposite sides of the
transport section (1).
Apparatus according to Claims 4 - 5,
characterized in that each deflection element (6; 61, 62)

has a part which projects obliquely into the region of
the transport section (1), the illumination device

(11, 111, 112) being arranged at the letter end of the
said part.
Apparatus according to Claims 4 - 6,
characterized in that the illumination device

(11, 111, 112) emits light beams with a pulse train
between 10 and 100 kHz.
Apparatus according to Claims 1 - 7,
characterized in that each deflection element (6; 61, 62)

is fastened in such a way that at most a prescribed
deflection force is exerted on the letters.
Method for the detection of overlaps of flexible,
flat letters which are conveyed sequentially, standing on

one of their edges, in a transport section (1), characterized
in that the conveyance of the letters in the

transport section (1) is carried out in such a way that
at least one mobile letter section of each letter is

temporarily deflected by a prescribed amount perpendicular
to the conveying direction, and in that, in order to

detect the presence of overlapping letter sections, an
evaluation of the spring-back behaviour of the letters is

carried out.
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the deflection is carried out at the front side of

the letter or at the rear side of the letter.
Method according to Claims 9 - 10, characterized
in that the deflection is carried out both at the front 

side of the letter and at the rear side of the letter.
Method according to Claims 9 - 11, characterized
in that the conveyance in the transport section (1) is

carried out by transport belts (2, 3) between which the
flat letters are guided, the letters being deflected

directly at or in the vicinity of the upper or lower edge
of the belt.
