<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling the gray scale of a 
plasma display device has a forming step of forming a 

frame for an image by a plurality of subframes each 
having a different brightness, a setting step of 

setting the number of sustain emissions of the each 
subframe individually for each subframe, and a 

displaying step of displaying the image on the plasma 
display device by a gray scale display having a 

specific brightness. The number of sustain emissions 
in each subframe is set individually by the individual 

subframe, and this can establish a linear relation between 
the gray level and the corresponding brightness. 

Therefore, an enhancement of display quality of the 
plasma display device can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
controlling the gray scale of plasma
display devices, for example a method and
an apparatus for controlling the gray scale of a three-electrode
surface-discharge alternating current plasma
display device.Consideration has been given to
alternating current plasma display panel (AC PDP) in
which luminescence and display is done by applying a
voltage wave-form to two sustain electrodes alternately
to maintain discharge. In this AC PDP, a discharge
operation is carried out in one to several microseconds
(Âµ s) just after the pulse application. Further, ions
(positive charges) produced by the discharge accumulate
on the surface of the dielectric layer on the electrode
to which a negative voltage is being applied and
similarly electrons (negative charges) accumulate on
the surface of the dielectric layer of the electrode to
which a positive voltage is being applied.When applying a pulse (sustain pulse) of a
lower voltage (sustain voltage or sustain discharge
voltage) with a different polarity after first
discharging with higher voltage (write voltage) pulse
(write pulse) to produce wall charges, previously
accumulated wall charges are overlapped yielding a high
voltage with respect to the discharge space, the voltage
exceeding the threshold voltage value of discharge,
which causes a discharge to begin. That is, there is a
characteristic that once a cell is written to discharge
generated wall charges, the discharge is sustained by 
applying sustain pulses alternately in opposite
polarity. It is called a memory effect or a memory
functionAn AC PDP may make use of the memory
effect. Regarding AC PDPs, there has been considered
a two-electrode type in which selective
discharge (address discharge) and sustain discharge are
carried out with two electrodes, and a three-electrode
type in which the third electrode is used for address
discharge. In a color PDP used for a color display, a
phosphor formed in a discharge cell is excited by
ultraviolet rays generated by the discharge. However,
there is a disadvantage that the phosphor is easily
affected by bombardment of ions (positive charges)
generated concurrently by discharge.In the above mentioned two-electrode type, the
arrangement is such that ions strike directly against
phosphors, which is likely to lead to a reduction in
the life of the phosphors. In order to avoid this, a
three-electrode arrangement may be used, making use
of surface discharge in a color PDP. Further, in such
a three-electrode type, it is possible to form the
third
