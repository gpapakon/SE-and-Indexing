<ABSTRACT>
The addition of up to 40 percent by weight of a 
non-reactive liquid MQ resin to high viscosity liquid 

curable organosiloxane compositions which cure by a platinum 
group metal-catalyzed hydrosilation reaction reduces the 

viscosity of the composition and the moduli of cured 
elastomers prepared from said composition without any 

substantial adverse effect on the physical properties of the 
cured elastomers, particularly tensile strength, elongation 

and tear strength. Cured elastomers prepared using these 
compositions are particularly suitable for use as mold-making 

and encapsulating materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid organosiloxane
compositions that cure by a platinum catalyzed hydrosilation
reaction. More particularly, it provides low viscosity
curable organosiloxane compositions that exhibit physical
properties in the cured form that previously could only be
achieved by using relatively high viscosity organosiloxane
compositions.Many ingredients for modifying the properties of
cured materials, which are prepared from organosiloxane
compositions, are described in the literature. For example,
methods for increasing the tensile and tear strengths of
organosiloxane elastomers include increasing the molecular
weight of the curable polyorganosiloxane, adding reinforcing
fillers, such as silica, and introducing solid resinous
organosiloxane copolymers that contain groups which react
with the curable polyorganosiloxane and/or the curing agent
during curing of the composition. Increasing the molecular
weight of the curable polyorganosiloxane and/or adding a
reinforcing filler will increase the viscosity of the
curable organosiloxane composition. Representative of this
prior art are U.S. Patents 3,957,713; 4,521,471; 4,882,398
and 5,082,886.For some end use applications such as
encapsulating and mold making, it is desirable to have a
viscosity below 100 Pa·s to ensure that the composition
fills all of the crevices in the mold master or the device
to be encapsulated and that the composition can be easily
freed of air bubbles generated when the ingredients of the
compositions are blended. Many compositions that cure by a
platinum catalyzed hydrosilation reaction do not have
sufficient stability to be stored as one-part materials for 
any length of time. The organohydrogensiloxane and platinum
catalyst are typically packaged in separate containers and
are combined shortly before it is desired to cure the
composition.In addition to a low viscosity prior to curing,
the cured elastomer used to prepare molds must have
sufficient integrity, strength and flexibility to withstand
repeated molding cycles during which the mold is
substantially deformed and is sometimes turned inside out to
remove the molded object. Depending upon the type of
material being molded, the mold can be subjected to
temperatures as high as 150°C and pressures up to 80 p.s.i.
(552 kPa) while forming polyurethane foams. EP-A-0 488 709 discloses an addition-curable type rubber
composition comprising a vinyl-containing organopolysiloxane
as a base polymer and, particularly, further comprising as a
crosslinking agent an
