<ABSTRACT>
A moulded article (2) for use in insulating two dual-conductor self-regulating 
heater cables (10,12) comprises two sleeves (4,6), one of which is 

twice the length of the other, secured together by a low profile web (8). One 
such article (2) is fitted over the exposed conductors (20,22) of each cable 

(10,12). The conductors (20,22) are crimped together, with the configuration 
of the articles (2) ensuring the crimps (26) are longitudinally offset from 

each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connection between electric cables, for
example multi-conductor cables, a component for use in the connection,
and a method of making the connection. The invention is particularly,
though not exclusively, useful for connecting heating cables, such as self-regulating
heating cables.When electric cables are to be connected together, outer layers such
as protective jackets, earthing and/or screening layers, and dielectric
layers are removed so as to expose the cable conductors. Respective
conductors are then electrically interconnected in a suitable manner, and
insulation re-applied to complete the cable splice. For example, the exposed
conductors may be encased within individual insulating sleeves, and the
conductors crimped together. If insulated crimps are used, the primary
insulation is then complete, and the outer layers may be reinstated
appropriately. However, if uninsulated crimps are used for making the
electrical connections, further care has to be taken to ensure that no short
circuits can occur in the connection region. The crimps may be
individually insulated from one another, but this involves additional steps
and the provision of additional components, and can lead to a bulky splice.
One solution to this problem is provided by the S-69 heat shrinkable splice
joint supplied by Raychem. In this joint the connections between respective
conductors of the cables are arranged to be longitudinally offset from one
another, such that, for example when joining together two dual-conductor
cables, the uninsulated crimp of one pair of connected conductors is
longitudinally adjacent an insulating sleeve of another pair of connected
conductors and separated from the uninsulated crimp therebetween. In
this way, a compact, low-profile splice can be obtained. To form such a
splice between two cables each of which has two conductors, for example, in
addition to the two uninsulated crimps, two shorter length insulating
sleeves and two longer length insulating sleeves are needed, the difference
in length of the sleeves being at least equal to the length of the crimp, and
usually being about twice the length of the crimp. The offset of the two 
crimps is achieved by cutting back the two conductors of each cable to unequal lengths,
as determined by the lengths of the supplied insulating sleeves, and then crimping the
longer conductor of one cable to the shorter conductor of the other cable. Provided the
insulating sleeves are correctly positioned on the corresponding lengths of
