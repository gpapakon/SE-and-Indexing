<ABSTRACT>
The device for orienting bodies being fed inordinately has a drum which is bounded on the underside by a base consisting of at least two discs or annular discs arranged one above the other, the outside diameter of one disc or annular disc in each case being greater than the outside diameter of the disc or annular disc located directly below. The disc or annular disc located at the bottom forms the lower boundary of a channel, the inside boundary of which is formed by the circumference of the disc or annular disc located above. The base of the drum is of stepped design. The orientation of the bodies is effected upon their entry into the channel, inside which the bodies are then transported forwards lying one behind the other in a row and are finally guided out of the drum.
