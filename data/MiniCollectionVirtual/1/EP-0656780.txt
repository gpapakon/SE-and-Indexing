<CLAIMS>
Injection solutions that are stable on storage 
containing at least one diphosphonic acid or at 

least one physiologically acceptable salt or one 
ester of such an acid as the active substance, 

wherein the pH value of the injection solution is 
3.0 - 4.5, the injection solution comprising no 

reducing agent or the pH value is 3.0 - 4.5 and the 
solution contains polyethylene glycols. 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the pH value of the solution is less than 4.5 and 

the solution contains polyethylene glycols. 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the pH value is about 4. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 3, wherein the solution contains up to 20 % 

polyethylene glycols having a molar mass of 200 - 
1500. 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the solution contains 0.05 to 0.2 ml Macrogol per 

1 ml injection solution. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 5, wherein the solution contains at least one 

1-hydroxy-aminoalkyl-1,1-diphosphonic acid and/or  
 

at least one physiologically acceptable salt or one 
physiologically acceptable ester of such an acid as 

the active substance. 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
the solution contains 1-hydroxy-3-(N-methyl-N-pentyl)aminopropyl-1,1-diphosphonic 

acid or one of 
its physiologically acceptable salts as the active 

substance. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 7, wherein the active substance is present as 

an alkali salt. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 8, wherein the solution contains the active 

substance in an amount between 0.1 and 1000 mg and 
NaCl in an amount of less than 10 mg/ml aqueous 

solution. 
Process for the production of injection solutions 
that are stable on storage containing at least one 

diphosphonic acid or at least one physiologically 
acceptable salt or one ester of such an acid as the 

active substance, wherein the pH value of the 
pharmaceutical solution containing the active 

substance is adjusted to 3.0 - 4.5 before being 
filled into the primary packaging made of glass, 

however, no reducing agent is added to the 
injection solution or the pH value is adjusted to 3.0 - 

4.5 and polyethylene glycols are added and, if 
desired, it is filled into glass containers which 

are surface-treated.  
 
Process for the production as claimed in claim 10, 
wherein it is filled into surface-treated glass 

containers which have been treated with ammonium 
sulfate, sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide or 

ammonium chloride. 
Process as claimed in claim 10 or 11, wherein the 
pH value is adjusted to about 4. 
Use of polyethylene glycols to stabilize injection 
solutions in glass containers containing at least 

one diphosphonic acid or at least one 
physiologically acceptable salt or one ester of 

such an acid as the active substance.
