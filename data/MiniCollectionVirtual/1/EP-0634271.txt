<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for adjusting the temperature of an ink in the inking unit of a printing machine, in which the ink is taken up by a ductor roller (2) from an ink fountain (4), which rests against said ductor roller and forms an inlet wedge therewith, and is passed into the inking unit. Provision is made for the temperature of the ink to be conditioned, i.e. heated or cooled as required, directly by special temperature-conditioning devices (20) ahead of and/or in the inlet wedge (13) of the ink fountain (4). This allows the temperature to be kept precisely constant, for example, even under variable operating conditions, but also allows intentional control of the temperature for the purpose of influencing the rheological properties of the ink.

A method of adjusting the temperature of a 
printing ink in the inking unit of a printing machine, 

wherein a duct roller (2; 32) transfers the ink from an 
adjoining duct (4; 34) to the inking unit and wherein 

the ink in the duct is temperature-controlled by 
devices (20; 42, 46), an ink inflow wedge (13; 36) 

being formed between the duct (3; 34) and the portion 
of the duct roller (2; 32) dipping into it, 

characterised in that the supply of ink maintained in 
the inflow wedge (13; 36) is always only sufficient for 

less than 10 revolutions of the duct roller (2; 32). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the ink is temperature-controlled in a separate 

container (18) disposed in front of the duct (4; 34) 
and is fed therefrom to the inflow wedge (13; 36). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the temperature-control devices (20; 42; 46) 

are controlled by a closed loop in dependence on 
properties of the ink and/or properties of the printed 

text detected by suitable sensors (50). 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that basic temperature control is 

effected by controlling the temperature of the duct 
roller (2; 32) and/or of the inking unit and final 

temperature control to the required final temperature 
is effected by the temperature-control device (20; 42, 

46).  
 
A device for adjusting the temperature of a 
printing ink in the inking unit of a printing machine, 

comprising a duct unit with a duct roller (2; 32), a 
duct (4; 34) adjoining the duct roller, and devices 

(20; 42, 46) for controlling the temperature of the ink 
in the duct (4; 34), wherein an ink inflow wedge (13; 

36) is formed between the duct (3; 34) and the portion 
of the duct roller (2; 32) dipping into it, 

characterised in that the inflow wedge (13; 36) always 
contains an amount of ink sufficient only for less than 

ten revolutions of the duct roller (2; 32). 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that an ink supply tube (22) aligned approximately 

parallel with the axis (8) of the duct roller and 
disposed in front of the duct (4; 34) in the direction 

of rotation of the duct roller (2; 32) is provided for 
supplying the ink to the duct (4; 34), and one or more 

drip nozzles (24) are distributed uniformly along the 
length of the tube and directed towards the duct roller 

(2; 32). 
A device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that a partition (10) disposed parallel to the duct 

roller (2; 32) divides the duct (4; 34) into a zone 
remote from the duct roller and a zone (12) near the 

duct roller and forming the inflow wedge (13; 36). 
A device according to any of claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that a closed-loop control device is 

provided with sensors (50) for recording properties of 
the ink and/or properties of the printed text and 

provided with means (48) for controlling the  
 

temperature of the temperature-control devices (20; 42, 
46). 
A device according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the control device is a component of a machine 

control system (48) for also controlling the supply of 
ink to the duct (4; 34). 
A device according to claim 9, characterised in 
that stripping elements (52) are provided and can be 

advanced towards the duct roller (32), and the advance 
of the stripping elements (52) is controllable by the 

machine control system (48).
