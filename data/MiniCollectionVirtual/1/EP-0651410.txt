<ABSTRACT>
A groove, into which a positioning element (20) which is like an annular disc is inserted, is cut out on the shaft (14) which has a square cross-section. A lever element (26) is pushed onto each of the two ends of the shaft (14), the aperture in the lever element being formed to correspond to the cross-section of the shaft (14) in order to ensure that it is driven in a rotationally fixed manner. The lever elements (26) are clamped to one another by means of screws (30) and are held in axial contact on the positioning element (20). In consequence, the lever elements (26) are also fixed in the axial direction.

Driving device for an electrical switchgear, 
particularly for medium and high voltage, having a 

rotating mounted shaft (14) displaying a polygonal cross-section, 
a lever element (26) and a securing element 

(44), each of which displaying a channel (28) 
corresponding substantially with the cross-section (15) 

of the shaft (14), through which the shaft (14) is led in 
such a way as to mate due to its shape, and with 

tensioning means (34) for tensioning against each other 
the lever element (26) and the securing element (44) 

towards the shaft axis (14') and for fixing the lever 
element (26) axially against the shaft (14), 

characterized in that the shaft (14) displays a 
circumferentially running groove (18) into which an 

annular positioning element (20) is inserted that 
projects radially beyond the circumference of the shaft 

(14) for at least part of the circumference of the shaft 
(14), and the lever element (26) and the securing element 

(44) are positioned on either side of the positioning 
element (20) and are held by the tensioning means (34) in 

an axial arrangement on the positioning element (20).  
 
Driving device as in claim 1, characterized in that 
the securing element (44) is formed by a second lever 

element (26). 
Driving device as in claim 2, characterized in that 
the lever elements 

(26) are of identical shape. 
Driving device as in any of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the positioning element (20) is a 

Seeger or Benzing circlip ring. 
Driving device as in any of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the tensioning means (34) 

preferably display screws (30, 32) diametrically opposite 
each other with reference to the shaft axis (14'). 
Driving device as in any of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the lever element (26) and the 

securing element (44) are stamped from one sheet.
