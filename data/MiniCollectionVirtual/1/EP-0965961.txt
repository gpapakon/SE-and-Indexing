<ABSTRACT>
An automated teller machine (ATM) (10) comprises a cash dispenser (18) for
dispensing bank notes to a customer (24) carrying out a banking transaction. It includes a

display screen (20) and a touch-sensitive screen (16) overlying the display screen. A
processing unit provides an image of a first pinpad on the display screen to enable a first

customer to touch the touch-sensitive screen and gain access to the cash dispenser. The
processing unit is also adapted to display on the display screen an image of a second pinpad,

which is different from the first pinpad image and enables a subsequent customer to gain
access to the cash dispenser. This second pinpad image may have X and Y coordinates which

are different from the X and Y coordinates of the first pinpad image and/or include a number
of keys having sizes which are different from the sizes of a number of keys of the first pinpad

image and/or have a pinpad layout which is different from a pinpad layout of the first pinpad
image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to providing an image of a keypad on a display screen,
and is particularly directed to providing an image of a keypad on a display screen of a self-service
terminal, such as an automated teller machine (ATM), to allow a customer at the
ATM to gain access to services provided by the ATM.The use of an image of a keypad or pinpad on a display screen of an ATM to allow a
customer at the ATM to gain access to services provided by the ATM is known. Typically,
to gain access to services provided by the ATM, the customer must touch a number of
different locations in a particular sequence on a touch-sensitive screen which overlies the
display screen. The locations on the touch-sensitive screen which the customer must touch in
the particular sequence depend upon the layout of alphabetic and/or numeric characters
contained in the image of the keypad appearing on the display screen. The particular
sequence of characters the customer must touch is commonly referred to as a personal
identification number (i.e.. PIN number) associated with the particular customer.A disadvantage in known ATMs is that the layout of the characters contained in the
image of the keypad on the display screen and their locations on the display screen are the
same for all customers desiring to gain access to services provided by the ATM. Since the
layout and location of the characters contained in the image of the keypad are the same for all
customers, it is possible for a thief fraudulently to establish the PIN number of a previous
customer at the ATM. To accomplish this, the thief initially cleans a transparent surface of
either the touch-sensitive screen or the display screen (depending upon the structure and
operation of the particular touch-sensitive screen used) before a customer to be defrauded
arrives at the ATM. After the customer to be defrauded arrives at the ATM, he enters his
proper PIN number to gain access to services provided by the ATM, carries out a desired
transaction. and leaves the vicinity of the ATM. The thief then closely examines the
transparent surface for fingerprint residue left behind by the customer. The particular
locations of fingerprint residue on the transparent surface and the different amounts of 
fingerprint residue at these particular locations provide valuable information to the thief in
fraudulently establishing the PIN number of the customer.More specifically, the particular locations on the transparent surface suggest which
characters contained in the image of the keypad

<CLAIMS>
A self-service terminal (10) comprising

a display screen (20),
a touch-sensitive screen (16) which overlies the display screen, and

screen to enable a user (24) to touch the touch-sensitive screen and gain access to services

provided by the self-service terminal, characterised in that the processing unit (32) is adapted
to display on the display screen (20) an image of a second keypad which is different from the

image of the first keypad to enable a subsequent user to gain access to services provided by
the self-service terminal.
A self-service terminal according to claim 1, characterised in that the image of
the second keypad on the display screen (20) has X and Y coordinates which are different

from X and Y coordinates associated with the image of the first keypad on the display screen.
A self-service terminal according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
image of the second keypad on the display screen (20) includes a number of keys having sizes

which are different from the sizes of a number of keys associated with the image of the first
keypad on the display screen.
A self-service terminal according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the
image of the second keypad on the display screen (20) has a keypad layout which is different

from a keypad layout associated with the image of the first keypad on the display screen.
A self-service terminal according to any preceding claim, which is an
automated teller machine, characterised in that it includes a cash dispenser (18) for dispensing

bank notes, and the images are images of pinpads.
A method of providing an image of a keypad on a display screen (20) of a self-service
terminal (10) to enable a user at the self-service terminal to gain access to services

provided by the self-service terminal, characterised by the steps of:
(a) displaying an image of a first keypad on the display screen to enable a
user to touch a touch-sensitive screen (26) overlying the display screen and gain access to

services provided by the self-service terminal; and
(b) displaying on the display screen an image of a second keypad
differentiated from the image of the first keypad to enable a subsequent user to touch the

touch-sensitive screen and gain access to services provided by the self-service terminal.
A method according to claim 6, characterised by displaying the image of the
second keypad at X and Y coordinates of the display screen (20) which are different from the

X and Y coordinates associated with the image of the first keypad.
A method according to claim 6 or 7, characterised by displaying the image of
the second keypad with keys having sizes which are different from sizes of keys of the image

of the first keypad.
A method according to claim 6, 7 or 8, characterised by displaying the image
of the second keypad with a keypad layout which is different from a keypad layout of the

image of the first keypad.
