<ABSTRACT>
The thermal cut-out consists of a strip-like leaf spring (1) with contact points (5, 6) at the ends for connection to corresponding circuit contacts (21, 22) on the substrate (20). The leaf spring (1) has a spring arm (4) as a connector between the contact points with a roof-shaped deformation (7) and a spring section (13) connecting thereto. After the leaf spring (1) has been soldered to the circuit contacts (21, 22), pressure distortion of the roof-shaped deformation (7) produces a prestress in the spring arm (4). The thermal cut-out is suitable for circuits in general and especially for film circuits.

Fuse for fixing on a circuit substrate (20), 
having a leaf spring (1, 53, 40) which is formed from a 

narrow sheet-metal strip and has, at its ends, at least 
two contact points (5, 6, 50, 51, 45, 46), of which at 

least one is a soldering point, for connecting to corresponding 
circuit contacts (21, 22) of the substrate (20), 

as well as at least one spring arm (4) as connection 
between the contact points (5, 6), characterized in that 

the spring arm (4) is designed, close to the one contact 
point (5), with a roof-shaped bulge (7), in that this 

bulge (7) is adjoined by a spring section (13) which 
extends to the other contact point (6), is of flat and 

elongate design, and in that the spring section (13) is 
designed to be elastically stiff in the region of the 

transition to the bulge (7) as well as in the region of 
the transition to the other contact point (6), so that a 

pressure deformation of the roof-like bulge (7) can be 
converted into a lateral movement and into an upward 

doming (25) of the spring section (13) when the leaf 
spring (1) is fixed at both ends and without prestress on 

the circuit substrate (20). 
Fuse according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the roof-like bulge (7) is formed by two limbs (9, 10) 

which are interconnected by means of a roof edge (8) and 
are approximately perpendicular relative to one another. 
Fuse according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the cross-section of the roof-like bulge (7) is 

reduced at least with respect to the cross-section of the 
adjoining spring section (13). 
Fuse according to Claim 3, characterized in that  
 

the ratio of the cross-section of the roof-like bulge (7) 
to the cross-section of the adjoining spring section (13) 

is approximately 1:2. 
Fuse according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized in 
that the cross-section of the roof-like bulge (7) is 

reduced by the fact that this bulge is narrower in terms 
of its width (b) than the adjoining spring section (13) 

at the transition point. 
Fuse according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the spring section (13) is angled, so as 

to be elastically stiff, close to the transition point to 
the roof-like bulge (7) with a bending radius (14). 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the spring section (13) is 

designed, so as to be elastically stiff, by a double bend 
(16) in the region of the transition to the other contact 

point (6). 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the spring section (13) tapers 

towards the other contact point (6). 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the ends of the leaf spring (1) are 

designed as contact tabs (5, 6) which lie in one plane 
and form soldering connections. 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that changes in cross-section are 

performed at those contact points (5, 6) of the leaf 
spring (1) which can be soldered to the circuit substrate 

(20). 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the leaf spring (53) is designed at 

one end with a contact tab (54) which bridges two separate 
contact points (50, 51) of the circuit substrate 

(52). 
Fuse according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that the leaf spring (40) has two mutually 

parallel spring arms (41, 42) which form, at one end, two 
separate contact points (45, 46) and are interconnected  

 
at the opposite end (48). 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the leaf spring (1) is arranged in 

a blank strip and separated from the blank strip immediately 
prior to fixing on the circuit substrate (20) and 

is fixed in a position which, in consequence, is fixed in 
terms of location, on the circuit substrate (20) in the 

unstressed state by means of a mounting device. 
Fuse according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that one spring end of the leaf spring 

(1) is additionally secured e.g. by means of a drop (24) 
of casting resin in the state in which it is fixed on the 

circuit substrate (20). 
Method for activating a fuse according to one of 
Claims 1 to 14, characterized in that the leaf spring (1) 

is placed without stress with its contact points (5, 6) 
onto the circuit contacts (21, 22) of the circuit 

substrate (20) and is soldered thereto, and in that, 
after the soldering, an upward doming (25) of the spring 

section (13) and in consequence the desired prestress are 
produced by pressure deformation of the roof-like bulge 

(7). 
Method according to Claim 15, characterized in 
that the upward doming (25) of the spring section (13) is 

carried out by lateral displacement of that angle (15) of 
the spring section (13), which is supported on the 

circuit substrate (20), in its longitudinal direction and 
away from the roof-like bulge (7). 
Method according to Claim 15 or 16, characterized 
in that the pressure force is exerted onto the roof edge 

(8) of a two-limb roof-like bulge (7).
