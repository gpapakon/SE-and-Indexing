<ABSTRACT>
Hair repair, styling, and straightening are accomplished by washing and rinsing
hair; applying an alkaline base hair straightening solution to the hair; allowing the

alkaline base hair straightening solution to remain on the hair until the hair transitions
into a structurally elastic condition; suspending the hair in the structurally elastic

condition by rinsing out the alkaline base hair straightening solution from the hair;
applying a hair repairing solution to the hair; applying a pre-oxidizing set to the hair

structure by compressing the hair under heat; applying an acid rinse to said hair; and
applying a neutralizer solution to the hair for a time period sufficient to eliminate the

structurally elastic condition of the hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to hair straightening processes and, in
particular, to an improved hair repair, styling, and straightening process wherein the
optimal reaction point of the hair with the hair straightening solution is more accurately
controlled and monitored.The hair straightening solution of the present invention has a unique jell-like
consistency to more completely and easily be rinsed from the hair. A unique pre-oxidizing
set is applied to the hair by application of heat and compression while the hair
remains in an elastic condition due to reaction with the hair straightening solution. The
pre-oxidizing set also provides the ability to make fine styling adjustments to the hair.The result of the process of the present invention is a substantial improvement to
the hair's sheen and surface structure compared to other prior art hair straightening
methods.Highly alkaline, permanent hair straightening solutions are well known in the
hair care art. When applied to hair, these highly alkaline solutions alter the molecular
bonds of the protein, molecules that make up the hair. While in this altered state, the
hair is mechanically straightened by the application of tension forces, typically by
combing, and/or styled on rollers. In addition, it is known that protein conditioners are
often introduced so as to bond with the hair to repair damage such as frizzles, split ends,
and the like. The introduced protein is intended to improve the feel and sheen of the hair.
The hair is then allowed to oxidize and return to its molecularly unaltered state. Most
often, an acidic neutralizer solution is applied to expedite the oxidation process.Such hair straightening processes utilizing these strong chemicals are somewhat
hazardous and can cause damage to the hair. The highly alkaline solutions are an irritant
to the scalp and, when in contact with the scalp, can result in hair loss when the hair is 
mechanically straightened by combing. Often times the alkaline solutions are provided
in a generally rigid cream or paste form so their application to the scalp can be avoided.
However these creams or pastes are difficult to rinse out. Sometimes oleaginous
materials are added to the solutions in an oil-in-water emulsion in order to protect the
scalp. These solutions are also difficult to rinse out. When the residue of the alkaline
solution remains in the hair, the ability to improve the quality of the hair structure by
conditioning is reduced.Thus, an alkaline hair straightening solution that can be

<CLAIMS>
A method of hair repair and straightening characterized by comprising
the following four steps:


(1) a step of rinsing out a neutralizer solution from hair,
(2) a step of applying a conditioner to said hair,
(3) a step of blow drying said hair, and
(4) a step of re-compressing said hair under heat.

(2) a step of applying an alkaline base hair straightening solution to said
hair;
(3) a step of allowing said alkaline base hair straightening solution to
remain on said hair until said hair transitions into a structurally elastic condition;
(4) a step of suspending said hair in said structurally elastic condition by
rinsing out said alkaline base hair straightening solution from said hair;
(5) a step of applying a hair repairing solution to said hair;
(6) a step of applying a pre-oxidizing set to said hair structure by
compressing said hair under heat;
(7) a step of applying an acid rinse to said hair; and
(8) a step of applying a neutralizer solution to said hair for a time period
sufficient to eliminate said structurally elastic condition of said hair.
A method of hair repair and straightening as set forth in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized by comprising an additional step of covering the hair with a plastic wrap

while said alkaline base hair straightening solution remains in said hair.
A method of hair repair and straightening as set forth in any one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said structurally elastic condition of said hair is

established when said hair becomes able to elastically stretch approximately between
about 25 to 50 percent.
A method of hair repair and straightening as set forth in any one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized by further comprising a step of determining when said

structurally elastic condition of said hair is established by grasping about four or more
strands of hair of about three centimeters apart and pulling on said strands of hair, said

structurally elastic condition established when said strands elastically stretch to
approximately about four to four and a half centimeters.

said hair under heat during said pre-oxidizing set.
A method of hair repair and straightening as set forth in any one of
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that oil is present in said hair repairing solution.
A method of hair repair and straightening as set forth in any one of
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that said step of suspending said hair in said structurally
