<ABSTRACT>
The grader has a hopper (1) which is mounted on the 
tracked base truck (2) by means of a fifth wheel (3); the 

post (6) on which the operator climbs is absolutely 
independent, and the grader blade (5) is arranged below it; 

the entire assembly is connected to the truck supporting 
the hopper (1) by means of levers (4) that can move so as 

to form a parallelogram, thus allowing grading work to be 
performed in a fully automatic manner, with perfect working 

results and great economy in construction costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns machines for grading road surfaces (see e.g. DE-A-3237718).The aim of the present invention is to provide a
machine to lay asphalt, especially on sidewalks or in any
case on road sections of limited width, almost fully
eliminating the use of manual work but nonetheless
providing a finished road surface of extremely commendable
characteristics and with a significant reduction in
construction costs.In the field of roadwork machines and particularly of
finishing machines for laying asphalt there are in fact no
commercially available machines for repairing and laying
sidewalks.It is evident that this fact entails an almost total
use of manual work in this kind of activity, with imperfect
results as to the quality of the structure thus produced
and with considerable management costs.The need to obviate all this is accordingly strongly
felt, and the search for suitable solutions is beginning to
gain ground in this sector.Some first attempts have been made, but so far the
solutions that have been tried have not proved resolutive.The grader according to the invention enters this
field with innovative technical solutions that make it
unique in its kind.Indeed it has:
1) a loading hopper which is mounted on a central
fifth wheel, has a system with an internal screw feeder,
and is suitable to receive the material and unload it where
it is most useful;2) a hopper opening system with hinged panels for 
loading by trucks of any size, thus avoiding unwanted
losses of material;3) parallelogram-like means for lifting the grader
blade to prevent tractor movements from affecting the
laying of the asphalt (ripple effect);4) mutually rigidly coupled control panel and operator
platform to facilitate handling in any type of operation
and make work safer;5) the possibility to move the grader blade laterally
to allow bitumen to be laid outside of the machine's bulk
while maintaining easy hopper loading;6) a grader blade that is mounted on a plane which is
inclined with respect to the advancement direction in order
to allow constant loading of the material without the aid
of fluid-actuated screw feeders, furthermore allowing any
obstacles to be passed over more easily.The invention is now described hereinafter in greater
detail with the aid of the accompanying drawings, wherein:
figure 1 (drawing I) is a general side view of the
machine according to the invention;figure 2 is a plan view of the machine, with the
hopper rotated through 90Â°;figure 3 (drawing II) is a view of the machine taken
from the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Machine for grading road surfaces, characterized in
that it comprises a loading hopper (1) which is mounted on

a tracked device (2) with the interposition of a central
wheel (3), rods (4) being arranged at the tracked device (2) so as to form a

parallelogram-like system, said rods (4) supporting a post (6) with a
platform for an operator and with control panels, a

grader blade (5) being mounted below said post (6),
the movement of the grader blade (5) being independent of the

position of the hopper (1), the material whereof can be
discharged along a central or lateral strip as desired by

the operator.
Machine for grading road surfaces according to
claim 1, characterized in that a screw feeder (7) with a

discharge opening (8) is arranged inside the hopper (1) to
move the material inside the hopper (1) and to allow its

discharge in the desired position without losses of
material.
Machine for grading road surfaces according to
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the hopper (1) can

be opened by swinging down a side wall (10), thus
allowing trucks or buckets to load said hopper (1) without

unwanted losses of material.
Machine for grading road surfaces according to
claims 1 and 3, characterized in that 

said rods (4) keep the platform on which the
operator rests always horizontal in any condition, even if

the terrain over which the machine advances is uneven.
Machine for grading road surfaces according to
claim 3, characterized in that said side wall

(10) of the hopper (1) can swing down by means of
a piston-operated actuation system (11).
Machine for grading road surfaces, according to
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said grader blade (5)

can move laterally and lay the material inside or outside
the advancement path of the tracked device (2) according to particular requirements.
Machine for grading road surfaces according to
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that said grader blade (5)

is mounted on rods (12) which are inclined with respect to the
advancement axis of the machine.
