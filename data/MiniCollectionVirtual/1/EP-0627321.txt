<ABSTRACT>
A sheet supply apparatus according to the 
present invention has a pawl separation means (23) for 

separating sheets (P) one by one by regulating the tip 
ends and upper surfaces of tip end portions of the 

sheets (P), which pawl separation means (23) can be retarded 
from a sheet regulating position when it is urged by 

the sheet with a predetermined force. With this 
arrangement, sheets (P) having small resiliency such as 

plain sheets are separated one by one by successively 
riding over the pawl separation means (23), and sheets 

having great resiliency such as post cards and 
envelopes urge the pawl separation means (23) to a retracted 

position to pass through the pawl separation means and 
are separated one by one by means of another separation 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet supply 
apparatus for separating stacked sheets one by one and 
for supplying the separated sheet, and an image forming 
apparatus having such a sheet supply apparatus and 
adapted to form an image on a supplied sheet. In the past, recording apparatuses such as 
printers, copying machines, facsimile machine and the 
like having a sheet supply apparatus have been so 
designed that an image comprised of a plurality of dots 
is formed on a sheet such as a paper sheet, a plastic 
film and the like by driving a recording head in 
response to image information. The recording apparatus 
of this kind utilizes an ink jet recording method, a 
wire dot recording method, a thermal recording method, 
an electrophotographic recording method or the like. 
Furhter, the sheet used with the recording apparatus of 
this type may be a plain paper sheet, a thick sheet such 
as a post card and an envelope, or a special sheet such 
as a plastic film. As means for supplying the sheet, 
a manual insertion sheet supply means for manually 
supplying the sheets one by one and an automatic sheet 
supply means for supplying stacked sheets one by one  
 
automatically and continuously by means of an automatic 
sheet supply apparatus are well-known. The sheet supply apparatus is provided with a 
separation means for preventing the double-feed of 
sheets by separating the sheets one by one, which 
separation means is generally constituted by a 
separation pawl for holding down a front corner of the 
sheet. In the separating method using such a separation 
pawl, undulation is created in the front corner portion 
of the sheet by the resistance of the separation pawl, 
thereby separating the sheets one by one. This 
separating method is relatively simple and is highly 
reliable. In such a sheet supply apparatus, when the 
sheets are stacked on a stacking means, an operator 
depresses the stacking means downwardly to increase a 
distance between the separation pawl and a sheet 
stacking surface of the stacking means so that the 
stacking of the sheets is not obstructed by the 
separation pawl. After the sheets are stacked on the 
stacking means, the stacking means is returned to its 
original position so that the front corner of the sheet 
stack is held down by the separation pawl. However, when the thick sheet such as an 
envelope and post card having high resiliency is 
supplied by using the conventional sheet supply 
apparatus having the above-mentioned separation pawl, 
since the thick sheet is
