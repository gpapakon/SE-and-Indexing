<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum valve including a casing having an inlet 
opening, an outlet opening, and a valve seat, a valve 

body accommodated in the casing and adapted to move 
rectilinearly between a position where it rests on the 

valve seat and a position which is away from the valve 
seat, means for pressing the valve body to the resting 

position, and a piston chamber in which an air differential 
pressure acts so as to separate the valve body from the 

valve seat against the pressing means, wherein the casing 
has a front wall portion which is at an acute angle to 

the direction of a streamline connecting the inlet and 
outlet openings and so that elongate foreign matter flowing 

in from the inlet opening can readily flow out, and side 
and rear wall portions expanding outwardly in a direction 

approximately perpendicular to the axis of the valve from 
a position near the valve seat so that bulk foreign matter 

flowing in from the inlet opening will not get caught 
between the valve body and the casing inner wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum valve and,
more particularly, to a vacuum valve which may be suitably
used in a vacuum sewer system in which soiled water, e.g.,
domestic waste water, is transported by vacuum.Since conventional gravity flow type sewer systems
suffer from the problem that the maintenance of conduit
tends to be costly, vacuum sewer systems have recently
attracted attention. In general, a vacuum sewer system is
composed of three parts, that is, a soiled water basin or
house inlet equipped with a vacuum valve, a vacuum sewer
pipe, and a vacuum pump station.Domestic soiled water is collected by gravity flow
in the soil water basin equipped with a vacuum valve.
As the liquid level in the soiled water basin rises to
a predetermined level, a vacuum valve control mechanism
detects it and opens the valve. Thus, the soiled water
collected in the soiled water basin is sucked into the
vacuum sewer pipe. The vacuum valve continues to remain
open for a predetermined period of time even after the
soiled water has been sucked in, and air is also sucked
in during this period. The soiled water in the pipe is
pushed by the expanding air in the pipe and carried to
a vacuum pump station in the form of a mixed-phase flow.
When a certain amount of soiled water has been collected in
a collecting tank, the water is sent to a sewage treatment
plant of a public sewage system by a soiled water booster
pump.The conventional vacuum valve that is used in the
above-described vacuum sewer system, however, suffers
from the problem that since the gap between valve body
and the inner wall surface of the valve casing is small,
when the valve is open or closed, bulk foreign matter,
e.g., pebbles, is likely to get caught in the gap, thus
interfering with the movement of the valve body. Since 
the above-described gap is constantly uniform along the
stroke of the valve body for the purpose of guiding the
valve body, there is always a likelihood of foreign matter
getting caught in the gap when the valve body operates.
If the valve body remains in a half-open position because
foreign matter has been caught in the gap, the vacuum in
the entire system is destroyed, causing a breakdown in
the vacuum sewer system.To solve the above-described problems, the present
applicant has proposed a vacuum valve such as that shown in
Fig. 5 as Japanese Patent Application No. 4-336571 (1992)
(Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 5-240373). The
vacuum valve V has a casing 31, a valve body 35 disposed in
the casing 31 in such a manner as
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vacuum valve (V) including a casing (1) having an inlet
opening, (2), an outlet opening (3), and a valve seat (4), a

valve body (5) accommodated in said casing (1) and adapted to
move rectilinearly along an axis (X) between a position where it rests on said

valve seat (4) and a position which is away from said valve
seat (4)

said axis (X) extending obliquely to a direction of a
streamline (S) connecting said inlet and outlet openings,

means for pressing said valve body (5) to the
resting position, and a piston chamber in which an air

differential pressure acts so as to separate said valve body
(5) from said valve seat (4) against said pressing means,

wherein said casing (1) has a bottom wall (1a) forming the valve seat (4),
and a side wall (1b)

expanding outwardly
from the bottom wall (1a) on the inlet side of said valve

seat (4),
said side wall (1b) having front, rear and

side wall portions (1c, 1d, 1e) located near said valve
seat (4), where

front indicates the wall portion (1c) closer
to the outlet opening (3) of the valve,

rear indicates the wall portion (1e) closer
to the inlet opening (2) of the valve, and

side indicates an intermediate portion (1d)
between front and rear,

said side and rear wall portions (1d, 1e) expanding
outwardly

in a direction approximately perpendicular
to said axis (X) of said valve (V) from a position near said valve

seat (4) so that bulk foreign matter (F) flowing in from said
inlet opening (2) will not get caught between said valve body

(5) and a casing inner wall of said casing (1),
 
characterized in that

said front wall portion (1c) being at an acute angle to said
direction of streamline (S)

so that elongate foreign matter (F)
flowing in from said inlet opening (2) can readily flow out.
A vacuum valve (V) according to Claim 1, wherein when said
valve body (5) is released from the resting position, the

distance between an outer peripheral portion of said valve
body (5) and said casing inner wall is at least 0.8 times the

diameter of said inlet opening (2) over a range of at least
120 degrees around said valve axis. 
A vacuum valve (V) according to claim 1, wherein said
acute angle is not larger than 60 degrees.
