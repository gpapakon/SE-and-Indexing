<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing free-flowing ammonium nitrate particles and an anticaking coating. Prior to final drying and storage the ammonium nitrate particles are coated by spraying with an aqueous solution of at least one inorganic salt, forming salt hydrates with at least one molecule crystal water. The particles are dried to a water content 
<
= the maximum amount of crystal water that can be bound by said inorganic salts. An aqueous solution, preferably of magnesium- and/or calcium nitrate is sprayed on the ammonium nitrate particles in an amount corresponding to 0.1-3 weight % of the coated particles. When magnesium nitrate is applied, the ammonium nitrate particles are dried to a water content 
<
= the water content in a coating of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O corresponding to a ratio mol H2O/mol Mg 
<
= 6. The invention is especially applicable on ammonium nitrate crystals. The anticaking coating comprises at least one inorganic salt having at least one mol of crystal water, preferably magnesium nitrate having 2-6 mols of crystal water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing free-flowing 
ammonium nitrate particles, applying an inorganic 
coating. The invention also comprises 
coated ammonium nitrate particles wherein the 
coating comprises at least one inorganic salt. Ammonium nitrate (AN) has high caking tendency, even at very low 
water content, i.e. the particles stick together and will no 
longer be free-flowing. Another problem related to ammonium 
nitrate is its transition from one crystal modification to 
another. Especially the transition from modification III-IV at 
about 32°C might result in dust formation and increased caking 
problems. This phase transition depends to some degree on the 
water content of the ammonium nitrate particles. There are known several methods for dealing with the above 
problems. Firstly, application of various coatings. However, if 
the ammonium nitrate is to be used in explosives like ANFO or 
emulsion explosives, the coating might cause problems for the 
manufacture and application of the explosive. Conventional 
anticaking coatings comprising amines or sulphonates with or 
without inert powder are examples of coatings causing problems 
when the coated ammonium nitrate is applied in explosives.  
 The phase transition at 32°C can be prevented or reduced by 
adding magnesium nitrate to the AN melt prior to particulation. 
But this method requires that the melt is evaporated down to a 
water content of about 0.5 weight% before particulation to attain 
reasonable caking properties of the particles. Such a super-evaporation 
is not applicable for manufacture of porous AN or 
crystal AN. Thus AN stabilized against phase transition will in 
most cases still need an anticaking coating. In European Patent No. 95814B is described a method for producing 
non-caking ammonium nitrate granules. This method comprises phase 
stabilization by a special cooling procedure. The particles are 
preferably coated with an organic coating and then an inorganic 
powder prior to storage. Further, it is in Japanese Patent Publication No. J61291411-A 
described AN particles having low caking tendency. The ammonium 
nitrate powder particles are blended with a zinc ammonium 
sulphate having less than 5 molecules of crystal water per 
molecule, and a metal oxide micropowder. The amount of sulphate 
is 0.05-1 weight% of the ammonium nitrate. Though the caking 
tendency is reduced by this method, the anticaking agent easily 
results in dust formation. The added sulphate and the metal oxide 
will also cause
