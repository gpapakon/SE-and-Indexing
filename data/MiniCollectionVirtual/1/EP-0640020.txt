<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
transducers. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to methods and apparatus for low frequency sonar 
projectors that convert electric signals to mechanically 
generated acoustic signals. In the field of sonar, a transducer is employed in the 
detection of underwater objects and is either a transmitter 
or a receiver. A projector is a sonar transmitter utilized 
to convert electrical signals to mechanical vibrations 
while a receiver intercepts reflected signals. Projector 
transmitters and receivers are known and separate projector 
and receiver arrays are formed from multiple projectors and 
receivers, respectively. The arrays are then utilized in 
conjunction with a sea craft to detect the underwater 
objects. A projector generally comprises an electromechanical 
stack element that converts electrical signals to 
mechanical vibrations. The stack element can be comprised 
of ceramic having a particular crystal structure. Ceramic 
projectors must be operated in an optimal temperature range 
to provide good performance. Further, ceramic projectors 
are normally operated in one of two operating regions 
depending upon the ceramic crystal structure. The two 
operating regions include the piezoelectric region and the 
electrostrictive region. If the ceramic crystal is subjected to a high direct 
current voltage during the manufacturing process, the 
ceramic crystal becomes remanent polarized and operates in 
the piezoelectric region. The electrical signal is then 
applied to the ceramic stack to generate mechanical 
vibrations. As an alternative, direct current voltage can 
be temporarily applied to the ceramic stack during 
operation to provide polarization of the crystal. Under 
these conditions, the operation of the projector is in the 
electrostrictive region. After the application of the 
direct current voltage is discontinued, the ceramic stack  
 
is no longer polarized. Many different types of sonar projectors are known. 
One particular type of projector is identified as a 
flextensional sonar projector which is a low frequency 
transducer. The low frequency transducer exhibits low 
attenuation of the acoustic signals in sea water. In 
general, a ceramic stack is housed within an elliptical-shaped 
outer projector shell. Vibration of the ceramic 
stack caused by application of an electrical signal 
produces magnified excursions in the outer projector shell. 
Thereafter, the excursions generate acoustic waves in the 
sea water. By way of
