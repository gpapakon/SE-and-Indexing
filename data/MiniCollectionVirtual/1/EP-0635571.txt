<ABSTRACT>
A biosensor which comprises a biochemical capable of 
producing a biochemical reaction in the presence of metal 

ions and a transducer arranged to detect a transducible 
output agent produced directly or indirectly by the 

reaction produced by the biochemical in the presence of 
metal ions characterised in that the biochemical comprises 

an enzyme which is a reductase for the metal to be 
detected. The said metal ions may be selected from 

mercury, chromium, arsenic, technetium, copper, silver, 
gold, selenium, vanadium, molybdenum and uranium. The 

reductase may be employed with co-enzymes in a biochemical 
chain reaction, eg the nicotinamide co-enzyme NADPH and 

the light emitting co-enzyme luciferase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biosensors and more
particularly to biosensors for detecting metal, especially
heavy metal, ions.In one known form of bionsensor described in European
Patent No 263948, a reactive biochemical component in the form
of a peptide from the group of phytochelatines is immobilised
on a transducer. On contact with aqueous solutions of heavy
metal ions, complexes with the phytochelatin lead to a change
in the transducer output and hence provide a rapid analysis of
heavy metal ions. However, detection in this way is not
specific to individual metal species and furthermore when the
peptide combines with the heavy metal from the complex formed,
eg if it is necessary to make further measurements using the
peptide.In JP-A-05 023 198, a method of determining mercury
levels is described in which a solution containing mercury ions
is contacted with a mercury ion reductase enzyme and NADPH.
The mercury ions are reduced to metallic mercury and the NADPH
is simultaneously oxidised to NADP+. The change in
concentration of NADPH to NADP+ is monitored directly by
changes in the fluorescence of the sample obtained by
irradiating the NADP+ with light. However, as a result of its
single stage process, that method requires reagent addition to
maintain NADPH, which is expensive, and it involves a
relatively complex piece of apparatus with sample modification
before hand by addition of mercapto compounds and detection at
a separation location.In EP-A-0 007 476.there is described a method of
determining NADPH in a clinical system.The article in Environmental Science and Technology vol.
25, no. 2, 1991 pp. 302-305 discloses a well-known process for
degrading organo mercurials for the detection of mercury in
biological samples. The purpose of the present invention is to provide an
improved biosensor in which these problems are avoided.According to a first aspect of the present invention
there is provided a biosensor for detecting ions of a metal
capable of being reduced by a metal reductase enzyme, the
biosensor comprising a transducer and an enzyme composition
comprising a metal reductase enzyme and a first co-enzyme
having a reduced state and an oxidised state and which is
converted from its reduced state to its oxidised state by the
reduction of metal ions by said metal reductase enzyme,
characterised in that
   the enzyme composition comprising the metal reductase
enzyme and first co-enzyme is immobilised; and
   the biosensor also comprises one or more other co-enzymes
in a co-enzyme chemical
