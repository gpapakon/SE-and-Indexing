<ABSTRACT>
An industrial fabric, for example a 
papermakers fabric, having a single layer of cross 

machine direction yarns 21a,21b (hereinafter CMD 
yarns) interwoven with a system of machine direction 

yarns 22,23 (hereinafter MD yarns). The weave of the 
fabric is such that alternate CMD yarns 21a are 

crimped to a significantly greater degree than the 
respective adjacent CMD yarns 21b. The crimped CMD 

yarns 21a have smaller diameter than the other CMD 
yarns 21b. The MD yarns 22,23 are flat monofilament 

yarns which are vertically stacked. The weave gives 
rise to a warp-fill in the range of 80-125%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to papermakers fabrics 
and in particular to fabrics comprised of flat monofilament 
yarns. Papermaking machines generally are comprised of 
three sections: forming, pressing, and drying. Papermakers 
fabrics are employed to transport a continuous paper sheet 
through the papermaking equipment as the paper is being 
manufactured. The requirements and desirable characteristics 
of papermakers fabrics vary in accordance with the particular 
section of the machine where the respective fabrics are 
utilized. With the development of synthetic yarns, shaped 
monofilament yarns have been employed in the construction of 
papermakers fabrics. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,290,209 
discloses a fabric woven of flat monofilament warp yarns; 
U.S. Patent No. 4,755,420 discloses a non-woven construction 
where the papermakers fabric is comprised of spirals made 
from flat monofilament yarns. Numerous weaves are known in the art which are 
employed to achieve different results. For example, U.S.  
 
Patent No. 4,438,788 discloses a dryer fabric having three 
layers of cross machine direction yarns interwoven with a 
system of flat monofilament machine direction yarns such that 
floats are created on both the top and bottom surfaces of the 
fabric. The floats tend to provide a smooth surface for the 
fabric. Permeability is an important criteria in the design 
of papermakers fabrics. In particular, with respect to 
fabrics made for running at high speeds on modern drying 
equipment, it is desirable to provide dryer fabrics with 
relatively low permeability. U.S. Patent No. 4,290,209 discloses the use of flat 
monofilament warp yarns woven contiguous with each other to 
provide a fabric with reduced permeability. However, even 
where flat warp yarns are woven contiguous with each other, 
additional means, such as stuffer yarns, are required to 
reduce the permeability of the fabric. As pointed out in 
that patent, it is desirable to avoid the use of fluffy, 
bulky stuffer yarns to reduce permeability which make the 
fabric susceptible to picking up foreign substances or 
retaining water. U.S. Patent No. 4,290,209 and U.S. Patent No. 
4,755,420 note practical limitations in the aspect ratio 
(cross-sectional width to height ratio) of machine direction 
warp yarns defining the structural weave of a fabric. The  
 
highest practical aspect ratio disclosed in those patents is 
3:1, and the aspect ratio is preferably, less than 2:1. U.S. Patent No. 4,621,663, assigned to the assignee

An industrial fabric, for example a papermakers fabric (20), 
comprising a single layer of CMD yarns (21a,21b) interwoven with a 

system of MD yarns (22-25) wherein alternate CMD yarns (21a) are 
crimped to a significantly greater degree than the respective adjacent other 

CMD yarns (21b) in said single CMD layer characterised in that at least 
some of said MD yarns (22-25) weave knuckles around each said alternate 

CMD yarns (21a) and all of said MD yarns weave in floats either over or 

under said other CMD yarns (21b). 
A fabric according to claim 1 wherein said CMD yarns 
(21a,21b) include yarns of at least two different diameters and are 

interwoven in a selected repeat pattern such that the CMD yarns (21a) 
having the relatively smaller diameter are crimped significantly more than 

the CMD yarns (21b) having the relatively larger diameter. 
A fabric according to claims 1 or 2 wherein said: 

MD yarns (22-25) are flat monofilament yarns having paired 
upper and lower yarns stacked in vertical alignment; and 
the actual warp fill of at least said upper MD yarns (22,24) is 
in the range of 80% - 125%. 
A fabric according to claims 1 or 2 wherein CMD yarns 
(21a,21b) alternate between a first relatively larger diameter and a second 

relatively smaller diameter in said single CMD layer.  
 
A fabric according to claim 4 wherein said MD yarns (22-25) 
are flat monofilament yarns having a thickness t and said first diameter is 

approximately equal to said second diameter plus t. 
A fabric according to claim 4 wherein said first diameter is 
about 0.8mm, said second diameter is about 0.6mm, and said MD yarns 

(22-25) are flat monofilament yarns having a thickness of about 0.2mm. 
A fabric according to claim 1 wherein said MD yarns (22-25) 
repeat with respect to four of said CMD yarns (21a,21b) with a float of 

three such that first and third CMD yarns within the float are not the CMD 
yarns which have the significantly greater degree of crimp. 
A fabric according to claim 7 wherein the float of some of said 
MD yarns (22-25) is over three CMD yarns and the float of other of said 

MD yarns is under three CMD yarns within the fabric repeat. 
A fabric according to claim 8 wherein each of the MD yarns 
(23,25) which have floats under the CMD yarns (21a,21b) are disposed 

beneath at least one MD yarn (22,24) which has its float weaving over the 
CMD yarns. 
A fabric according to claims 1, 2, 7, 8 or 9 wherein said MD 
yarns (22-25) are flat monofilament yarns having an aspect ratio greater 

than 3:1.
