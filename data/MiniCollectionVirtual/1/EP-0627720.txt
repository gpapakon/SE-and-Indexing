<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a document bearing an image or a text, excluding a geographical map, and broken down into a large number of elementary areas with which a large number of indices are respectively associated. According to the invention, each index comprises a grouping of points (10) which is carried on the document in proximity to the associated elementary area and constituting a specific code of the said area, the set of indices constituting a locating raster covering the said image or the said text and superimposed on the latter, each grouping of points being capable of being read by optical reading means interacting with a computer system including a data medium addressable by means of the said indices.

Document bearing an image or text, excluding a 
geography map, and broken down into a large number of 

elementary regions respectively associated with a large number 
of indices, wherein each index includes a group of points (10) 

borne on the document close to the associated elementary zone 
and constituting a specific code of said zone, all the indices 

constituting a localization frame covering said image or said 
text and superimposed on the latter, each group of points being 

able to be read by optical read means cooperating with a data 
processing system comprising a data medium addressable to the 

device of said indices. 
Document according to claim 1 and intended to be read 
by optical reading means including an ordinate matrix of 

pixels, each index being read by an elementary matrix of pixels 
distributed approximately isotropically, the points of said 

group of points (10) being distributed on some of the pixels 
(30) of said elementary matrix so as to embody a binary coding 

of each of them. 
Document according to claim 2, wherein only certain 
pixels (30) of said elementary matrix bear a coding point, these 

pixels being separated from one another by one or several 
pixels without any coding point. 
Document according to claim 3, wherein only a small 
part of said pixels (30) bears a coding point. 
Document according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the points of each group of points are disposed with 

respect to the others so as to define a mark comprising solely 
two orthogonal directions (x, y) for the entire localization 

frame. 
Document according to any one of claims 2 to 4, wherein 
said elementary matrix (10) is formed of several lines and 

several columns of pixels.  
 
Document according to claim 6, wherein certain of said 
lines or columns of pixels define said index, each line or 

column bearing points distributed in such a way as to embody a 
"2 from 5" type code representing a figure from 0 to 9. 
Document according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the various groups of points of the localization frame 

are disposed with respect to one another so as to define a mark 
comprising two orthogonal directions (x, y). 
Document according to claim 8, wherein the various 
groups of points 
are disposed in the manner of a checkerboard. 
Documentary analysis system including a document 
according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein it 

further comprises an optical reading pencil having an analysis 
field covering several indices (10) placed side by side and 

provided with illumination means having a specific wavelength 
enabling them to discriminate between said localization frame 

and said image or said text.
