<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement contains a plurality of detectors which are connected to a central station and of which some are fitted with at least two sensors (1, 2) for monitoring different fire characteristics. One sensor (1) is preferably a thermal sensor and the other sensor (2) is an optical sensor. In addition, the arrangement contains means for processing the signals of the sensors. These means are arranged in a decentralised manner in the detectors and they contain a microcontroller (MCU) for conditioning the sensor signals and for signal processing for the purpose of obtaining danger signals. The danger signals are obtained in a neuronal network (NN).
