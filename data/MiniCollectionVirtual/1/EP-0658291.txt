<ABSTRACT>
A stator core for rotary high power density electro-mechanical transducers formed of multiple segments (20) which have a plurality of radially oriented teeth (24). The stator core is a composite of two or more segments (20) circumferentially combined to form a cylindrical stator or armature for electric motors or generators. The segments (20) are wound with wire (37) either when the segments (20) are aligned linearly, when arranged circumferentially on the inside surface of a jig (50), or about a cylinder. The wound stator can have teeth (24) extending radially outwardly or inwardly, to accommodate an outside or inside rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stator or armature for brushless dc electric
motors and generators. The stator or armature is constructed from a plurality of
segments that carry the windings and which are assembled in a cylindrical shape.
This technology is highly suited for machines with a high pole count which
requires a large number of teeth. This motor design will result in a high power
density electro-mechanical transducer.The vast majority of conventional electric motors have stator cores
constructed from sheets of laminated steel. The individual laminations are
punched from flat sheets of steel using specially constructed dies with the
necessary shape of slots and teeth incorporated in them. Laminations made by
this method are coated with a thin insulation layer, and then a plurality of these
laminations are stacked together to form the complete laminated stator. The
construction of the stator core with the laminations separated by layers of very
thin insulation is intended to control the iron losses experienced in the stator.
These losses are a function of the thickness of the lamination and of the material 
used. This type of insulation technique could be considered to be on the
macroscopic level, implying that bulk volumes of material are insulated from each
other by an electrically (but not magnetically) insulating layer. Other parameters
affecting the iron losses are also important but are outside the scope of this
discussion.A second but less widely used conventional construction typically involves
cold pressing raw metal powder into a "green" shape, followed by sintering the
product to improve its mechanical properties. It is well known that this
technology produces parts with minimal waste of material having good
dimensional tolerance (with very little machining required). It is also an effective
method of reliably producing parts with complex geometry. Sintering such green
shapes, which involves diffusion between particles of controlled size and
properties, is typically accomplished at or less than the melting temperature of
the material. Sintering increases mechanical strength, magnetic permeability and,
unfortunately, iron losses. The increase in iron losses is so significant that some
form of macroscopic insulation technique must be employed to control the
phenomenon within acceptable limits. The reason for the increase in iron losses
during the sintering process is that diffusion, which occurs between the particles,
increases their electrical continuity and eddy current losses.In order
