<ABSTRACT>
From not more than three blending stocks, it is possible to prepare a wide variety of mixtures of esters of hindered polyhydric alcohols that are especially valuable lubricants for chlorine-free fluorocarbon refrigerant heat transfer fluids, particularly Refrigerant 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lubricant base stocks,
which can also serve as complete lubricants in some cases;
compounded lubricants, which include at least one additive
for such purposes as improving high pressure and/or wear
resistance and corrosion inhibition along with
the lubricant base stocks which contribute the primary lubricity
to the lubricants; refrigerant working fluids including
lubricants according to the invention along with
primary heat transfer fluids; and methods for using these
materials. The lubricants and lubricant base stocks are
generally suitable for use with most or all halocarbon refrigerants
and are particularly suitable for use with substantially
chlorine-free, fluoro-group-containing organic
refrigerating heat transfer fluids such as pentafluoroethane,
1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, and tetrafluoroethanes,
most particularly 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.Chlorine-free heat transfer fluids are desirable for
use in refrigerant systems, because their escape into the
atmosphere causes less damage to the environment than the
currently most commonly used chlorofluorocarbon heat
transfer fluids such as trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane. 
The widespread commercial use of
chlorine-free refrigerant heat transfer fluids has been
hindered, however, by the lack of commercially adequate
lubricants. This is particularly true for one of the most
desirable working fluids, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, commonly
known in the art as "Refrigerant 134a" or simply
"R134a". Other fluoro-substituted ethanes are also desirable
working fluids.The following patents and published patent applications
also teach many general classes and specific examples
of polyol esters as useful refrigerant lubricants
with chlorine-free fluoro group containing heat transfer
fluids: US-A-4,851,144; GB-A-2 216 541; US-A-5,021,179; US-A-5,096,606;
WO-A-90/12849 (Lubrizol); EP-A-0 406 479 (Kyodo
Oil); EP-A-0 430 657 (Asahi Denka KK); EP-A-0 435 253 (Nippon
Oil); EP-A-0 445 610 and 0 445 611 (Hoechst AG); EP-A-0 449
406 (Tonen Corp.); EP-A-0 458 584 (Unichema Chemie BV); and
EP-A-0 485 979 (Hitachi).A wide variety of viscosities and other physical and
chemical properties are needed to achieve optimal effectiveness
of lubricants in the many different types of refrigeration
equipment in practical use.For example, home refrigerators of the normal type
generally are required to maintain cool temperatures within
a relatively small and well insulated space, and the
temperature of their environment, to which waste
