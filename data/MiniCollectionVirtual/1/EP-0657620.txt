<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a system which are designed for controlling the behaviour of a drilling tool. An additional resistive torque (18) is added to the torque at the drilling tool (17) so that the overall torque (19) at the tool is an increasing function of the speed of rotation of the tool. The system according to the invention comprises regulation means capable of creating an additional resistive torque at the tool.

A method of controlling the stability of the 
rotation speed of a drill bit driven in rotation by a 

drill string which is itself rotated by mechanical means 
at the surface, the said bit being subjected to an end 

torque due to the action of drilling a well bore, in 
which an additional resisting torque is created in the 

vicinity of the bit as a function of the rotation speed 
of the bit and a given value so that the overall end 

torque at the drill bit resulting from the sum of the 
torque at the bit and the said additional torque is an 

increasing function of the rotation speed of the bit. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the said additional resisting torque is created by 

friction means joined to the drill string in the vicinity 
of the bit. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the said additional resisting torque is created by 

increasing the weight on the bit. 
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that the said increase in weight on the tool is provided 

by specific means positioned in the vicinity of the bit 
and activated by the rotation speed of the drill bit. 
A system for controlling the stability of the 
rotation speed of a drill bit driven in rotation by means 

of a drill string which is itself rotated by mechanical 
means from the surface, the said bit being subjected to 

an end torque due to the action of drilling a well bore, 
the said system having regulating means joined to the 

drill string in the vicinity of the bit, the said means 
being designed to create an additional resisting torque 

at the bit, the value of the said torque being a function 
of the rotation speed of the bit. 
A system as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the said regulating means have means for producing  

 
friction on the well walls. 
A system as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the said regulating means have means for varying the 

force applied by the tool to the bottom of the well bore. 
A system as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the said regulating means have means for measuring 

the rotation speed of the drill bit and means for 
regulating the value of the additional resisting torque 

as a function of the rotation speed of the bit.
