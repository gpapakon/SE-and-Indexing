<ABSTRACT>
The card contains, in particular, an irreversible counter, a balance and a certificate attesting the integrity of the previous information. The contents of the card can be updated only by terminals which know the calculation secrets of the certificate. By virtue of the irreversible counter which intervenes in the calculation of the certificate, it is not possible to reload the card with earlier contents (balance/certificate), since such reloading requires the counter to be incremented, thus rendering the earlier certificate null and void.

<CLAIMS>
Process for updating an information (tr) contained in a part (Tr) of a
memory (M) contained in a smart card (CM), with the aid of a terminal (T)

equipped with a security module (MS), the memory (M) containing a counter
area (C), the content of the part (Tr) of the memory (M) to be updated

having a certificate (d) contained in an area (D) of said part (Tr), said
certificate being a given function (g) of the identity (i) of the card,

a balance (b) contained in another area (B) and the content (c) of the
counter area (C) and the identity (j) of the security module (MS) which has

performed the last updating, said process comprising incrementing by one
unit the content (c) of the counter zone (C) prior to any updating of the

part (Tr) if and only if the content (c) of the counter zone (C) has been
incremented, erasing the certificate contained in the zone (D) of the part

of the memory to be updated and rewriting the updated certificate and
authenticating the card (CM) and its content (M) by the terminal (T) before

and after updating.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the balance (b)
contained in the area (B) is a financial balance, the process then being a

payment process corresponding to a service.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that it consists of:

a) checking that the certificate (d) contained in the area (D) of the part
(Tr) of the memory is indeed a given function (g) of the identity of the

card (i), its balance (b), the content (c) of the storage area (C) serving
as the counter, and the identity (j) of the final security module having

performed the last transaction;
b) calculating, in the security module (MS), a new balance (b') differing
from the old balance (b) by a certain number of units (n), corresponding to

a service;
c) calculating, in the security module (MS), a content of the counter (c')
equal to the old content (c) increased by one unit (c'=c+1);
d) calculating in a new certificate (d') equal to said function (g) of the
identity of the card (i), the new balance (b'), the new content (c') of the

counter and the identity (j') of the security module (MS); 
e) incrementing by one unit the content (c) of the storage area (C) of the
card serving as the counter (c'=c+1);
f) if and only if said content (c') has in fact been incremented is it
possible to erase the part (Tr) of the memory of its old content (tr)

constituted by the old balance (b), the old certificate (d) and the old
identity (j) of the final security module used and write there in its place

a new content (tr') constituted by the new balance (b'), the new certificate
(d') and the identity (j') of the security module of the terminal;
g) authenticate by the security module (MS) the card (CM) and at least the
identity (j) of the new content (tr') of the area (Tr);
h) in the case of authenticity, modify the balance (s) of the security
module by the quantity (n) corresponding to the modification of the balance

of the card (s'=s+n).
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that, in order to authenticate
a card (CM) during its introduction into a terminal (T):


the security module (MS) chooses and stores a random variable (x) and
the address at the terminal (T),
the terminal (T) addresses said random variable (x) to the card (CM),
the card (CM) reads the content of its memory (m) and the address at the
terminal (T),
the security module (MS) calculates a function Y=f(x,m) of the random
variable (x) and the content (m) of the memory (M),
the card calculates a function Y=f(m,x) of its content (m) and the random
variable (x) received and addresses this function (Y) to the terminal,
the security module (MS) tests that the result of the function (Y)
received from the card is indeed identical to the result of the function

which it has calculated.
