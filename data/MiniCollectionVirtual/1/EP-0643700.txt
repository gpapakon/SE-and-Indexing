<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new substituted pyrazolylpyrazoles, 
processes for their preparation, as well as 
intermediates, and their use as herbicides. It is known that 1-phenylpyrazoles possess herbicidal 
activity (e.g. EP 154115, DE 3402308, EP 34945 and 
GB 2123420). However the herbicidal activity of these compounds in not 
high enough or selectivity problems can occur in important 
crops. The object of the present invention is to make new 
compounds that have improved biological properties over 
the known compounds. It has now been found that substituted pyrazolylpyrazoles 
of general formula I 
 
in which 
R1is C1-C4-alkyl, optionally substituted by one or more 
halogen atoms; R2hydrogen, or a C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkylthio, C1-C4-alkoxy, 
each of which is optionally substituted by one or 
more halogen atoms, or  
 R1 and R2together form the group -(CH2)n-X-, where X is 
bound at R2; R3is hydrogen or halogen, R4is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, R5is hydrogen, nitro, cyano or the group -COOR6 or 
-CONR7R8, R6is hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C2-C6-alkenyl or C2-C6-alkynyl; R7 and R8independently of each other are hydrogen or 
C1-C6-alkyl or R7 and R8together with the nitrogen to which they are 
attached form a morpholino, piperidino or a 
pyrrolidino group; Xis CH2, O, S(O)m or NR9, R9is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, mis 0, 1 or 2, and nis 2, 3 or 4, possess better herbicide properties than 
the known compounds of related structure. Particularly active are those substituted pyrazolylpyrazoles 
of general formula I, in which 
R1is methyl, R2is methyl, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, 
methylthio, difluoromethylthio, dichloromethylthio, 
C1-C4-alkoxy, 1,1,1-trifluoroethoxy or difluoromethoxy 
or R1 and R2together form the group -(CH2)n-X-, where X is 
bound at R2; R3is hydrogen, chloro or bromo, R4is hydrogen or methyl, R5is hydrogen, nitro, cyano or the group -COOR6 or 
-CONR7R8, R6is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, R7 and R8independently of each other are hydrogen, methyl 
or isopropyl, or  
 R7 and R8together with the nitrogen to which they are 
attached form a piperidino group; Xis CH2, O, S(O)m or NR9, R9is hydrogen or methyl, mis 0, 1 or 2, and nis 2, 3 or 4. The term "halogen" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine and 
iodine. It is to be understood that the term "alkyl", "alkenyl" 
and "alkynyl" includes branched as well as straight 
chained hydrocarbon groups. The invention also includes intermediates of general 
formula II 
 
in which R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings given in general 
formula I. The compounds of the
