<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatographic printer includes an imaging 
station (A, B, C, D, E) for forming a latent 

electrostatic image on the surface of a drum (24), a 
toner development station (32) for developing the latent 

image to form a toner image, and a toner transfer station 
(34) for transferring the toner image onto a moving web. 

An image-fixing station (16) for fixing the toner image 
on the web comprises 
two pairs of radiant heat sources 
(92), the peak energy output wavelength of which lies in 

the non-visible part of the spectrum. The radiant 
sources (92) may be located in hingedly mounted pairs of 

housings (80, 81, 82, 83) in such a manner that the 
housings may be moved into a closed position to shield 

the radiant sources (92) from the web when the speed of 
movement of the web falls below a predetermined value. 

Damage to the web when movement thereof stops is thereby 
avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with an electrostatographic
printer. More particularly, it is concerned with the
fixing of toner images obtained via electrophotographic,
electrographic, ionographic or magnetic recording
processes in which an electrostatic or magnetographic
latent image is rendered visible by the deposition of an
suitable toner composition on the latent image.In present day copying machines or electronic printer
devices, the fixing or permanent adherence of a toner
image on a receptor material in the form of a sheet is
mostly carried out with a so-called roller fixing system.
This image-fixing unit comprises a pair of rollers
through the nip of which a sheet carrying a toner image
is fed. The surface of the roller contacting the toner
image is heated above the melting temperature of the
toner resin, which becomes tacky or molten and forms a
permanent bond with the surface of the sheet. The
roller, contacting the toner image, is provided with a
coating showing abhesive properties versus the toner
image. In order to increase the abhesive characteristics
of the roller surface, use is often made of silicone oil.
The rollers forming the image-fixing unit are pressed
against each other with high force. The roller
contacting the backside of the web is generally covered
with a silicone elastomer, capable of resisting the heat
generated by the image-fixing roller.Problems arise with hot roller image-fixing devices. In 
particular, in heavy duty printers where long periods
between servicing are usual, it is difficult to maintain
a constant image-fixing quality.Where the receptor material is in the form of a
continuous web, there is a need to synchronise the drive
to the image-fixing rollers to the movement of the
receptor material therethrough, but this may be difficult
where the surface of one or both of the rollers is
resilient, leading to uncertainty in its circumferential
speed. There is a need to accurately align the image-fixing
rollers, otherwise damaging skewing forces on the
web may result. Roller image-fixing systems, due to the
high pressure exerted in the nip formed by the rollers,
also can be the cause of the toner image being smeared,
especially in colour work. A second effect is that the
high pressure gives rise to a fixed image showing an
increased, and often unwanted, gloss. This degrading or
"calendering" effect may even be transmitted to the
receptor material itself so that its surface structure
may wholly or partially be lost. Furthermore, damage to
the receptor material, and to
