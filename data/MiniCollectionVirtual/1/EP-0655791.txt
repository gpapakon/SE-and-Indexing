<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing active
cathode material for lithium secondary battery having a composition
of LixNiyM1-yO2.In recent years, high performance, compact and portable
electronic equipments have been developed with the progress of
the electronic technology. Thus, it has been required for
secondary batteries used in these electronic equipments to have
high energy density.Hitherto, as a secondary battery used in these electronic
equipments, nickel cadmium battery, lead battery and the like
were used. However, these batteries have lower discharge
potential, and are therefore insufficient in providing higher
energy density.In view of this, in recent years, there have progressed
researches/developments of lithium secondary batteries in which
material capable of doping/undoping lithium ion, such as, for
example, lithium, lithium alloy or carbon material is used as
active anode material; lithium compound oxide, such as, for
example, lithium cobalt compound oxide, lithium nickel compound
oxide or lithium nickel cobalt compound oxide, etc. is used as
active cathode material; and a solution in which lithium 
electrolyte such as LiCℓO4, etc. is dissolved into a non-aqueous
solvent is used as electrolytic solution. This lithium secondary
battery has high battery voltage, high energy density, less
self-discharge, and excellent cycle characteristic. It has been
confirmed that, among the above-mentioned materials, employment
of lithium nickel compound oxide (LiNiO2) as the cathode provides
higher energy as compared to employment of lithium cobalt
compound oxide (LiCoO2) as indicated by U.S.P. No. 4302518,
U.S.P. No. 4357215 and U.S.P. No. 4980080. In addition, nickel
has yield greater than that of cobalt as material and is
therefore inexpensive. Also from a viewpoint of this, development
of lithium secondary battery using lithium nickel compound oxide
or lithium nickel cobalt compound oxide including higher
percentage of nickel component than cobalt component is being
expected.However, in a lithium secondary battery using lithium nickel
compound oxide or lithium nickel cobalt compound oxide including
high composition ratio of nickel component, there is a tendency
for battery capacity to be likely to have unevenness, thus
disadvantageously failing to maintain prescribed quality.It is considered that the reason why such a problem takes
place is that the composition of a lithium nickel compound oxide or
lithium nickel cobalt compound oxide including a high composition
ratio of nickel component
