<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and an 
apparatus for examining presence or absence of pin holes of bag-shaped products 

composed of thin type synthetic resin or rubber membranes. 
A product composed of thin synthetic resin or rubber to be subjected 
to examination for defects is inflated by air, and a ultrasonic wave generated in 

accordance with an air flow spouting from its pin hole is detected.. 
As a ultrasonic wave sensor, an electrostritive element capable of 
sensing a ultrasonic wave of 20 to 100 kHz is recommended.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
examining pin holes of bag-shaped products composed of thin synthetic resin or 
rubber membranes or films such as for example gloves for operations, packs for 
blood transfusion, liquid transfusion and the like made of latexes. Products such as gloves for operation, packs for blood transfusion, 
liquid transfusion and the like made of latexes may exert unforeseen influences 
extremely dangerous for users when there are pin holes, admixture of foreign 
matters such as bubbles and the like. Especially in recent years, medical treatment 
techniques are highly advanced progressively, and the frequency of use of such 
products rapidly increases, and hence there is such a tendency that accidents due 
to their defects frequently occur, so that more strict examination than before is 
requested. The examination method adopted at present in Japanese Industrial 
Standard (JIS T9107 1992) is a water tight property test, in which a cylindrical 
vessel having a volume of about 1.2 liter, a diameter of about 6 cm and a length of 
about 40 cm is filled with about 1 liter of water, the end portion of a glove is 
tightly fixed to its opening portion using a band of an O-ring shape, the vessel is 
inverted upside down and lifted by a holding tool to be vertical, and presence or 
absence of water leakage is investigated by visual observation after passage of 2 
minutes in a state as it is, which is extremely primitive. In addition, an electric conductivity test is described in this JIS for a 
reference. In this method, one electrode of non-polarization electrodes is fixed in 
an electrolyte solution, a product to be examined is placed in the solution, an 
electrolyte is also injected into its inside, another electrode of the non-polarization 
electrodes is inserted, the liquid level at the inside of the product is held to be  
 
slightly higher than that at the outside, and an electric resistance is measured after 
30 minutes from the immersion of the test article into the solution. This method has such problems that the test requires a time of at least 
not less than 30 seconds, and a long time is also required for washing and drying 
of the product after completion of the test. In addition, altough there is not prescribed in JIS and the like, a 
method is widely performed in which air or the like is injected into the inside of 
the product and then it is immersed in water, and generation of bubbles is 
observed so as to sense leakage. However, any of these
