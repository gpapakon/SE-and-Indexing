<ABSTRACT>
An articulated bed comprising: a central platen (1) comprising a headboard end, a footboard end, a first side platen (2) edge and a second side platen (2') edge; a headboard frame pivotally connected to the headboard end of the central platen (1) at a headboard frame pivot point (A) with a central platen headboard bar linkage (3); a footboard frame pivotally connected to the footboard end of the central platen at a footboard frame pivot point with a central platen footboard bar linkage; a first side platen (2) hinged to the first side platen edge of the central platen (1) connected to the headboard frame with a first side platen headboard bar linkage (3) and connected to the footboard frame with a first side platen footboard bar linkage; a second side platen hinged (2') to second side platen edge of the central platen (1), connected to the headboard frame with a second side platen headboard bar linkage and connected to the footboard frame with a second side platen footboard bar linkage; and means (13) for articulating at least one bar linkage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ARTICULATING BEDFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to various apparatus and methods for rotating bedridden individuals, and more particularly to an improved bed utilizing a mechanical method of manipulating a multiple part platen, articulating under the patient to mechanically and automatically rotate the bedridden person from side to side to eliminate prolonged tissue compression and enhance cardiovascular activity throughout the body of the individual .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 07/885,621, filed May 19, 1992, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application.According to traditional, prior art methods of turning people, most people are physically lifted and turned by hand, and propped up with pillows, or rotated in special beds which require the patient to be strapped into the device (i.e., the Striker Bed) . Manual turning is risky to the care giver, frequently resulting in lower back stress or other damage. In addition, due to hospital overloading, the turning is often delayed, or not accomplished in a timely manner, leading to problems to the bedridden patient.Other systems currently in use include waterbeds; problems are: 1. do not provide gross body motion;2. the patients may not be able to tolerate the buoyant rocking motion of the bed; 3. the waterbed is notoriously difficult for patient transfer (to and from the bed) ; 4. a waterbed is extremely heavy; 5. waterbeds cannot provide relief for thin or obese patients,(common complications of quadriplegia) ; 6. small areas of skin covering bony protuberances can still be compromised because of the tension in the surface of the water filled mattress. 

 Another common system is the alternating air pump mattress, consisting of parallel rows of pliant plastic tubes attached along the edges of the mattress . The tubes are alternated in their connection so that every other tube is pressurized and then deflated in timed cycle. This device will provide some relief from pressure sores. Problems: 1. does not provide gross body motion; 2. relies on line power for operation; 3. not very effective for thin patients; and 4. not comfortable.The third system is Flotation. This consists of a very expensive system of pumping air, alternating the inflation of a series of porous sacs upon which the person is supported. Problems: 1. does not provide gross body motion; 2. some components are consumable;3. relies on line power for

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An articulated bed comprising: a central platen comprising a headboard end, a footboard end, a first side platen edge and a second side platen edge; a headboard frame pivotally connected to the headboard end of the central platen at a headboard frame pivot point with a central platen headboard bar linkage; a footboard frame pivotally connected to the footboard end of the central platen at a footboard frame pivot point with a central platen footboard bar linkage; a first side platen hinged to the first side platen edge of the central platen, connected to the headboard frame with a first side platen headboard bar linkage and connected to the footboard frame with a first side platen footboard bar linkage; a second side platen hinged to second side platen edge of the central platen, connected to the headboard frame with a second side platen headboard bar linkage and connected to the footboard frame with a second side platen footboard bar linkage; and means for articulating at least one of the central platen headboard bar linkage and the central platen footboard bar linkage.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the central platen headboard bar linkage rotates about the headboard frame pivot point in an aligned position adjacent the headboard frame between a first parallel headboard support and a second parallel headboard support .
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the central platen foot board bar linkage rotates about the footboard frame pivot point in an aligned position adjacent the footboard frame between a first parallel footboard support and a second parallel footboard support.
4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the first side platen is continuously hinged to the first side 


platen edge of the central platen with a continuous polymeric hinge and the second side platen is continuously hinged to the second side platen edge of the central platen with a continuous polymeric hinge.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a programmable microprocessor based controller.
6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said programmable microprocessor based controller controls said apparatus based on a set of variables, said set of variable comprising: a left dwell period of time during which the apparatus remains at a left angle position, a center dwell period of time during which the apparatus remains at a center position, a right dwell period of time during which the apparatus remains at a right angle position, a left angle which determines the left angle position, a right angle which determines the right angle position, and speed.
7. The apparatus of claim 6 further comprising a separate power supply comprising: a weatherproof box; a 12 volt sealed lead acid battery; a 12 volt, 1 amp, smart charger; a 15 amp circuit breaker; and an on/off switch.
8. An apparatus comprising: a central platen comprising a proximal end, a distal end, a first side platen edge and a second side platen edge; a first frame pivotally connected to the proximal end of the central platen with a central platen proximal bar linkage; a second frame pivotally connected to the distal end of the central platen with a central platen distal bar linkage; 


 a first side platen hinged to the first side platen edge of the central platen, connected to the first frame with a first side platen proximal bar linkage and connected to the footboard frame with a first side platen distal bar linkage; a second side platen hinged to the second side platen edge of the central platen, connected to the proximal frame with a second side platen proximal bar linkage and connected to the footboard frame with a second side platen distal bar linkage; and means for articulating at least one of the central platen proximal bar linkage and the central platen distal bar linkage.
