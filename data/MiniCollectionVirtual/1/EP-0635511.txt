<ABSTRACT>
A diphosphite is provided derived from 
phosphorous trihalide, tetra alkyl hindered 

bisphenol, and a neoalkyl diol. The phosphites 
exhibit improved stability and are useful as thermal 

oxidative stabilizers for thermoplastic compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to diphosphites, and more
particularly relates to neoalkyl diphosphites.Diphosphites of the formula:

wherein Y is a divalent radical selected from the
group consisting of:

R is independently selected from the group consisting
of hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably
of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and halogen, preferably
chlorine or bromine; R1 is independently selected from
the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 12
carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R2
is independently selected from the group consisting
of hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms,
preferably of 1 to 9 carbon atoms, and halogen,
preferably chlorine or bromine; and R3 is
independently selected from the group consisting of
alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably of 1 to 9 
carbon atoms, and halogen, preferably chlorine or
bromine, see Dever et al. U.S. Patent 3,467,733.
Dever et al.
teaches that the diphosphites may be obtained by
reacting a cyclic phosphorohalidite of the formula:

wherein R is as previously mentioned, and A is
halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine, and lists 5-butyl-5-ethyl-2-chloro-1,3,2,-dioxaphosphorinane,
with a hydroxy organic compound of the formula:

wherein R1, R2, and R3 are as previously mentioned,
and lists 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane among
others. While some of these phosphites find utility
as stabilizers for polymers, it is desired to improve
their hydrolytic and ultraviolet light stability.
Diphosphites are also claimed in DE-A-3009634 and FR-A-1384809.Consequently, the present invention provides a
diphosphite exhibiting improved stability.The present invention provides phosphites of the
formulae: 

wherein each R4 is independently selected from the
group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl radicals having
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, each R5 is independently
selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals
having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, each R6 is selected
from the group consisting of alkyl radicals having
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R7 is selected from divalent
alkylidene radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.The diphosphites may he obtained from the
following reactants: a) phosphorous trichloride
(PCl3) or a phosphite ester P(OR8)3 wherein each R8 is
a hydrocarbon radical preferably selected from the
group consisting of alkyl and aryl groups, b)
neoalkylene glycols, and c) the hydroxy organic
compound is tetra alkyl hindered bisphenolic like
2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-t-butyl phenyl) propane.
The neoalkylene glycol may be reacted with the
phosph
