<ABSTRACT>
The thermal insulation compound system (3) for fastening to a building wall (1) comprises a light-absorbing wall outer face (2), an at least partially light-transmitting thermal insulation material (4) and, on the outside, a weather-resistant, at least partially light-transmitting plaster layer (5), if desired with interposition of a light-transmitting reinforcement (6). This plaster layer (5), with a layer thickness of between 0.5 and 6 mm, consists of a hardening binder containing filler to an extent that the degree of radiation transmission in the case of perpendicular irradiation lies above 20 %. To avoid overheating, at least one layer having a multiplicity of embedded hollow bodies or microhollow bodies is applied to the thermal insulation material, said hollow bodies or microhollow bodies forming a transparent spatial limitation for a material whose light-transmitting capacity reversibly decreases when a predetermined temperature is exceeded.

Heat-insulation combination system for fixing 
to the wall of a building (1), comprising a light-absorbing 

wall outer surface (2), a heat-insulating 
material (4) which is at least partially transparent and, 

optionally with the insertion of a transparent 
reinforcement (6), on the outside a weather-resistant 

layer of plaster (5) which is at least partially 
transparent, has a layer thickness between 0.5 and 6 mm 

and comprises a curing binding agent containing fillers 
to the extent that the degree of radiation transmission 

with perpendicular irradiation lies above 20%, 
characterized in that there is applied to the heat-insulating 

material (4) at least one layer (5) with a 
plurality of hollow bodies or micro hollow bodies 

contained therein, which form a transparent space 
boundary for a material the transparency of which 

decreases in a reversible manner upon the exceeding of a 
predetermined temperature. 
Heat-insulation combination system according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the layer with the 

contained hollow bodies or micro hollow bodies containing 
the light-controlling material is formed by the layer of 

plaster (5). 
Heat-insulation combination system according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the hollow bodies are 

formed as spheres, oblongs or ovals. 
Heat-insulation combination system according to 
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

hollow bodies consist of glass.
