b) the total of the nickel and the chromium in the
steel is at least 20% by weight and at most 35%

by weight;

20% by volume of martensite and it is devoid of

austenite or comprises less than 80% by volume
thereof.

0.3 mm.
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that its tensile strength is at least

2400 MPa.
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the steel of the wire comprises

at least 0.05% and at most 0.15% by weight of carbon.
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that in the steel of the wire the

total of the nickel and the chromium is at least 22 and
at most 30% by weight. 
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the sulphur content and the

phosphorus content are each less than 0.05% by weight.

withstand until it breaks, this measurement being

effected on a length of wire equal to 500 times its
diameter, one end of the wire being held in a fixed

jaw, and the other end being held in a rotary jaw,
which is turned such that the axis of rotation is the

same as the axis of the wire, the tension upon this
torsion being equal to 5% of the breaking load of the

wire measured before torsion.
A wire according to Claim 9, characterised in
that its ductility in torsion is at least 50 turns.
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the structure of the steel

comprises at least 50% by volume of martensite and it
is devoid of austenite or comprises less than 50% by

volume thereof.
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the structure of the steel is 

practically constituted either solely of martensite or
solely of martensite and austenite.
A wire according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,

of which which form one or more internal layers are in
accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 13, the outer

layer being formed of non-stainless wires.
A carcass for a tyre, characterised in that it
comprises at least one wire according to any one of

Claims 1 to 13 and/or at least one assembly in
accordance with any one of Claims 14 to 16.
A tyre comprising at least one carcass in
accordance with Claim 17.
A process for preparing the wire in accordance
with any one of Claims 1 to 13, this process being

characterised by the following features:
