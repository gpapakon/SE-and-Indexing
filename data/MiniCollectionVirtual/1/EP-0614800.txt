<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a novel twin-hull boat equipped with a 
pair of hydrofoils 4 and 5 which are respectively secured to 

bottom surface of twin-hull structures 3A and 3B traverse on 
the stem and stern sides thereof. A pair of auxiliary wings 

6A and 6B are installed by way of being opposite from each 
other at predetermined positions on the internal wall surfaces 

of the twin-hull structures 3A and 3B mutually facing the hull 
center line and at a predetermined height position between 

upper water line formed in the course of low-speed cruising 
and lower water line formed in the course of high-speed 

cruising. The twin-hull boat incorporates a postural angle 
regulating device 15 to properly regulate postural angle of 

the auxiliary wings 6A and 6B by causing them to pivot on the 
horizontal axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a twin-hull boat
which is equipped with a plurality of hydrofoils across a twin
hull and capable of cruising itself at a high speed.Today, any of conventional twin-hull boats with
hydrofoils is transversely equipped with a plurality of
hydrofoils below the bottom of the stem and the stern across
a twin hull. Such a boat is, for example, known from
GB-A-1 524 938.In the course of securing a plurality of hydrofoils to
the bottom of the stem and the stern of a twin-hull,
predetermined hydrofoils are provisionally secured to the
bottom of the completed twin hull before executing trial runs
by cruising the boat as of this condition. Finally, based on
the result of trial runs, optimal angle for securing
hydrofoils to the twin-hull boat is eventually determined.Nevertheless, in the case of the conventional twin-hull
boat with hydrofoils cited above, since optimal angle for
securing hydrofoils to the twin-hull is determined in final
stage in order that the angle can be suited for cruising the
boat at a very high speed, the determined angle cannot be
optimal in transitional period from the time in which
hydrofoils remain still to the time at which the twin-hull 
boat starts to cruise itself via hydrofoils being afloat the
water surface.Therefore, any conventional twin-hull boat with
hydrofoils in service today necessarily spends much time in
the transitional period before actually starting to cruise
itself via hydrofoils being afloat the water surface.Even though there is such a known twin-hull boat based
on a system for swinging hydrofoils in order to vary postural
position of hydrofoils, this in turn requires installation of
a special device in limited space of the hull to materialize
swinging of the hydrofoils, and yet, involves much difficulty
to install the device therein. In addition, total cost for
manufacturing the twin-hull boat incorporating this system is
quite high.Therefore, primary object of the invention is to
provide a novel twin-hull boat which is equipped with a
plurality of hydrofoils and capable of effectively exerting
floating function in accordance with actual cruising condition
despite of own simple structure.To achieve the above object, as an important aspect of
the invention, according to the novel twin-hull boat equipped
with a plurality of hydrofoils which are transversely disposed
across both-side hulls below the stem and the stern, a pair of
auxiliary wings are independently secured at least to either 
the internal wall on the part of the center line
