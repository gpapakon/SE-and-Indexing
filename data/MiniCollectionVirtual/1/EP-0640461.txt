<ABSTRACT>
Crease lines (5, 6, 19, 20) of flexible creased packaging material 
to be used for the producing of fluid tight packaging containers 

are produced by deforming webs (4, 17, 18) or sheets, respectively, 
of the packaging material along the expected folding lines 

(4, 5, 6, 19, 20) in the melt (soft and plastic, respectively) 
condition of the webs which webs comprise thermoplastics and 

inorganic mineral fillers (at an amount of between 50 and 80% 
by weight).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for producing a flexible 
creased packaging material from which liquid-tight packaging 
containers can be produced. A method of the type according to the first part of claim 1 
is described in GB-A-1 554 143. According to this method between 
5 and 70% by weight of inorganic particulate material and between 
95 and 30% by weight of polypropylene (PP) or other PP-copoylmers 
are mixed so that the mixture comprises, in the soft or melt 
condition, a melt flow index between 0,55 and 2,2 according 
to ASTM (2,16 kg, 230° C). This molt mass is extruded in order 
to form sheets of a thickness between 0,1 and 1,2 mm after 
which extrusion steps the sheets are cooled and then polished 
or otherwise treated. Finally, the sheets are cut in order 
to form playing cards or are creased in order to form blanks 
comprising crease lines. The blanks can be bended along the 
crease lines which facilitate bending of different portions 
of the blanks with regard to neighbour portions thereof. The 
crease lines are produced by partially cutting away parts of  
 
the sheets according to GB-A-1 583 324 or by calendring the 
sheets in the solid condition between calender rolls which 
press portions of the sheets along the crease lines together 
in order to reduce the sheet thickness along the crease lines 
according to US-A-3 122 976. However, such packaging material very often does not fullfill 
the conditions for preparing foldable containers which are 
filled with e.g. liquid filling goods which containers need 
stiffness (high resistance against deforming when filled) and 
need a high rigidity (high resistance against cracking in 
particular at the crease lines which are forming relatively 
sharp corners of the final packaging container). Weakening the 
thickness of the sheet according to the conventional methods 
for forming crease lines raises such problems. Therefore, packaging materials comprising fiber fillers are 
much more favoured by the experts in the field of packaging 
materials. However, they comprise other disadvantages. There 
is very often a risk of crack formation in the packaging material 
in particular in the regions of 180° folding along a crease 
line in order to prepare the sealing finn of the final packaging 
containers which are produced by using tube forming, container 
forming, filling and container closing machines. Such tensile 
stresses frequently are so great that cracks occur not only 
in gas tight intermediate layers like aluminum foils but also 
in

<CLAIMS>
Method for producing a relatively flexible creased packaging 
material to be used for producing liquid-tight packing containers, 

in which the starting substances for the packaging 
material, namely thermoplastics as well as inorganic, mineral 

fillers (at an amount between 50 and 80% by weight) are 
mixed and are extruded in the soft and melt plastic condition 

respectively, of said thermoplastics as webs and sheets, 
respectively, and in which the webs and sheets, respectively, 

are deformed along the crease lines,characterized in that 
the deforming of the webs (4, 17, 18) along the crease lines 

(5, 6, 19, 20) is carried out in the melt (soft and plastic, 
respectively) condition thereof. 
Method as claimed in claim 1,characterized in that 
the deforming is carried out by cool rolls and cylinders 

(11, 12, 21, 22), respectively, provided with raised portions 
and matrices, respectively. 
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,characterized in that 
the deforming of the webs (4, 17, 18) is carried out during 

extruding. 
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,characterized in that 
the deforming of the webs (4, 17, 18) is carried out 

immediately after extruding in the still melt (plastic) 
condition before cooling and solidifying of the webs. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,characterized in that 
some sheets and webs, respectively, are simultaneously 

extruded and connected together by co-extrusion. 
Method as claimed in claim 5,characterized in that 
three sheets and webs (18a, 18b, 18c), respectively, are 

co-extruded.
