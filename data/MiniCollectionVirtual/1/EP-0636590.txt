<ABSTRACT>
Applicants have discovered that by heating cured polymer-coated fiber 
at temperatures of 100°C or more, they can enhance the fiber pullout strength by 

25% or more. This postcure heating can advantageously be done off-line by placing 
loosely wound fiber in a heated oven. Alternatively the postcure heating can be done 

on-line by reel-to-reel passage of the fiber through a heated furnace. Preferred 
temperatures are in the range 100°C - 300°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for making optical fiber and, in 
particular, to a method for making polymer-coated optical fiber having enhanced 
pullout strength. Optical fibers are key components in modern telecommunications 
systems. Optical fibers are thin strands of glass capable of transmitting an optical 
signal containing a large amount of information over long distances with very low 
loss. In essence, an optical fiber is a small diameter waveguide characterized by a 
core with a first index of refraction surrounded by a cladding having a second 
(lower) index of refraction. Light rays which impinge upon the core at an angle less 
than a critical acceptance angle undergo total internal reflection within the fiber core. 
These rays are guided along the axis of the fiber with minimum attenuation. Typical 
optical fibers are made of high-purity silica with minor concentrations of dopants to 
control the index of refraction. Commercial optical fibers are provided with polymer coatings to protect 
them from mechanical abrasion and stress. Typical polymers are urethane-acrylate 
coatings. The coatings are typically applied and cured with ultraviolet light as the 
fiber is drawn in a continuous process. It is commercially desired that the polymer coating adhere to the fiber 
yet, when the need arises, permit visually clean stripping for splicing with other 
fibers and interconnecting with photonic devices. The accepted test of fiber-coating 
adhesion is the pullout test which measures the force needed to slide out one 
centimeter of fiber from its polymer coating. Applicants have discovered that by heating cured polymer-coated fiber 
at temperatures of 100°C or more, they can enhance the fiber pullout strength by 
25% or more. This postcure heating can advantageously be done off-line by placing 
loosely wound fiber in a heated oven. Alternatively the postcure heating can be done 
on-line by reel-to-reel passage of the fiber through a heated furnace. Preferred 
temperatures are in the range 100°C - 300°C.  In the drawings: 
FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a typical cured, polymer-coated optical 
fiber which can be processed in accordance with the invention; and FIG. 2 is a graphical illustration showing the effect of off-line oven 
heating on the pullout strength of a typical fiber. The first step in enhancing the pullout strength is to provide a cured, 
polymer-coated optical fiber. FIG. 1 of the drawings is a schematic view of a typical 
coated fiber 10 shown with a stripped end 11 comprising
