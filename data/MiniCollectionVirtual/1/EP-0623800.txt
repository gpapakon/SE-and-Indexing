<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus locatable in a missile 
tip 56, comprising a turbine impeller 10 operatively 

connected to an electricity generator 12, and a valve 
assembly 14 locatable upstream of the impeller 10. In use 

an induced flow of air passes through a passage 60 defined 
by the missile tip 56 to drive the turbine 10 and the 

generator 12. The valve assembly 14 is designed to 
throttle the flow of air at the maximum flight speeds 

reached by the missile tip 56. The generator 12 becomes 
operative again at lower flight speeds to power electronic 

equipment located in the missile tip 56.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
selectively providing electrical power for use in a missile
such as a rocket or an artillery shell.It has become essential for most modern missile systems
to have onboard electrical and electronic systems. Typical
of such systems are proximity fuses, guidance and
television systems. All these systems obviously require a
supply of electrical power.A particular requirement of electrical power supplies for
these applications is that they must remain entirely
inactive before launch to ensure safe handling by the
launching crew. Furthermore the electrical power supply
systems must remain reliable even after extended periods of
storage. Conventional chemical cells or batteries fail to
meet at least one of these requirements, and are generally
considered unsuitable for use in missiles.A known method of supplying electrical power to missiles
involves providing an air-driven turbine acting on a dynamo
located inside the missile. An induced airflow is urged
through the turbine during flight. Since no comparable
airflow occurs during storage and handling, this type of
power supply system makes the missiles intrinsically safe
during handling before they are launched. Furthermore the
required moving parts are far less susceptible to 
deterioration during handling and storage then would be
the case for a comparable chemical power supply system.A disadvantage of this type of power supply system is
encountered, however, when these missiles are fired over
long ranges, requiring higher than usual launching speeds.
The relative air speeds to which their turbines become
exposed along extended flight paths tend to lead to
overheating as a result of frictional losses as the
missiles travel through the air, while the turbines
simultaneously reach excessively high rotational speeds.
The present invention seeks to addres this shortcoming.United States patent 2,701, 526 (preamble of claims 1 and 5) describes an air flow
regulator for maintaining substantially constant, a
quantity of air flowing in a duct and in particular, a
regulator for controlling a turbine of an air driven
generator. United States patent 3,382,805 describes an
air flow actuated delay arming device having a resiliently
urged air scoop extendible into a slip-stream to a
magnitude determined by the equilibrium of the slip-stream
and resilient forces acting thereon. United Kingdom patent
2,007,338 describes a nose portion of a missile for
regulating a flow of ram air to a turbine. PCT

<CLAIMS>
A method of selectively providing electrical power to
a missile (54) having a turbine (10) for driving an

electricity generator (12) by directing an induced airflow
through a passage (60) within the missile (54) towards the

turbine (10) while the missile (54) is in flight,

characterised by the step of
 throttling the induced
airflow to the turbine (10) by progressively urging a

tapered, displaceable spindle (38) axially towards an
orifice (44) located in the passage (60) when the speed of

the missile (54) exceeds a predetermined limit.
A method according to claim 1 in which the induced
airflow is throttled by progressively urging the tapered,

displaceable spindle (38) towards the orifice (44) located
in the passage (60) as the rate of the induced airflow

increases.
A method according to claim 2 in which the spindle
(38) is displaced by exposing a perforated actuator (34),

which is connected to the tapered spindle (38), to the
induced airflow.
A method according to claim 3 in which the actuator
(34) is located in the path of the induced airflow,

upstream of the spindle (38) and orifice (44).
An apparatus for selectively generating electrical
power in a missile (54), which apparatus includes a

turbine impeller (10) locatable in a chamber (64) defined
by the missile (54), the impeller (10) being operatively

connected to a rotatable electricity generating means
(12), 
characterised by the provision of
a valve seat (42) defining an orifice (44), the valve
seat (42) being locatable in a passage (60) within

the missile (54) for directing an induced airflow
through the orifice (44) towards the chamber (64) 

provided for the turbine (10) when the missile (54)
is in flight;
a displaceable body (38) having a complementary
portion (40) matching the size of the orifice (44) in

the valve seat (42); and
resilient biasing means (46) arranged between the
valve seat (42) and the displaceable body (38), the

biasing means (46) being so dimensioned as to permit
the body (38) to approach the seat (42) at

progressively increasing flight speeds by the missile
(54), thereby throttling the airflow to the turbine

(10).
An apparatus according to claim 5 in which the valve
seat (42) defines a circular orifice (44), while the

displaceable body (38) includes an elongate spindle (38)
having a frusto-conical tip (40) having a maximum outside

diameter exceeding the diameter of the orifice (44).
An apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 in which
the displaceable body (38) includes a piston (34)

connected to the spindle (38), the spindle (34) including
a perforated plate located upstream of the frusto-conical

tip (40) of the spindle (38), thereby in use allowing a
flow of air through the perforations (36) to urge the tip

(40) towards the orifice (44) in the valve seat (42).
An apparatus according to claim 7 in which the
resilient biasing means (46) is interposed between the

perforated plate (34) and the valve seat (42) to ensure
that the valve tends to shut when the missile (54) flight

speed exceeds a predetermined upper limit.
A missile (54) which includes an apparatus as claimed
in any of claim 5 to 8, comprising


an elongate body tapering in a forward direction
towards a tip (56), the body defining a passage (60)

extending rearwardly into the body; 
a turbine impeller (10) located in a chamber (64)
within the body, the chamber (64) being in fluid

communication with the passage (60), and the impeller
(10) being so arranged that an induced airflow

directed through the passage (60) imparts a rotating
motion on the impeller (10) when the missile (54) is

in flight;
rotatable electricity generating means (12),
operatively connected to the turbine impeller (10),
characterised by the provision of
a valve (14) located upstream of the turbine impeller
(10), which valve (14) includes a displaceable body

(38) having a portion (40) matching an orifice (44)
in a seat (42) located in the passage (60), and

resilient biasing means (46) arranged between the
seat (42) and the body (38), which is so dimensioned

that the induced airflow past the body (38) tends to
urge it towards the orifice (44) against the bias of

the biasing means, shutting the orifice (44) at
increasing missile flight speeds.
