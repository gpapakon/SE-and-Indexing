<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an eye drop formulation, which, in combination, comprises pilocarpine and a further agent for the treatment of ocular hypertension, as well as an ophthalmologically acceptable carrier and optionally further, ophthalmologically acceptable adjuvants. The formulation is characterized in that the pH thereof is from 3.5 to 5.8 and the viscosity is from 10 to 25000 mPas. The invention also relates to the preparation of the said formulation, as well as its use for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmological
preparation, specifically an eye drop formulation, which,
in combination, comprises pilocarpine and
a β-blocking
agent, e.g. timolol, wherein the pH of the formulation is from
3.5 to 5.8 and the viscosity is from 10 to 25000 mPas, whereby the stability
and bioavailability of the eye drop formulation is improved.
The invention further
concerns a process for the preparation of the said formulation,
as well as the use thereof for the treatment of
intraocular hypertension and glaucoma.In WO 91/19481 the use of a macromolecular polymer mixture
exhibiting reversible gelling properties depending on pH, temperature or ionic strength as a
drug delivery system is disclosed.From the EP-patent application 253 717 it is known to
administer into the eye simultaneously a β-blocker and
pilocarpine in the form of an eye drop combination formulation
which is buffered to a pH of 6.0 to 6.8. The use of
a combination formulation rather than administering the two
drugs separately has, in addition to beneficial therapeutical
effects, also the further advantage of improving
patient compliance.However, the formulation according to the EP-patent application
253 717 has the disadvantage that the solution
formed remains usable only for a short period of time,
wherefore it has to be made shortly before first use,
either by combining a solid substance and a solution, or
two separate solutions. Thus the formulation according to
this EP-patent application cannot be packed and delivered
to the user in the traditional bottle package or as a unit-dose
package, as both package forms require that the
solution contained therein is ready for administration into
the eye, and also that it is sufficiently stable.The formulation disclosed in the EP-patent 253 717 places
strict demands on the packaging technology used, and also
on patient acceptance. Further, the highly complicated 
packages are substantially more expensive than the traditional
ones because they have to be constructed so as to
allow the preparation to be prepared shortly before
administration. The different components of the formulation
are combined by somebody else than the manufacturer
and thus there is a definite risk for dosage mistakes. In
order to ensure sterility also after mixing of the components,
the formulation contains antimicrobial preservatives.However, it has for a long time been known that antimicrobial
preservatives exhibit a number of side effects on
the cornea. In eye therapy,
