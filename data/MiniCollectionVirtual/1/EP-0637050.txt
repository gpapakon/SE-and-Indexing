<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to minute field-emission
elements, which are capable of integration and operable at a low
voltage. The present invention relates also to the methods of
fabricating the minute field-emission elements.At the outset, it is to be noted that the following
description and the claims use "( )" to describe a crystal
plane and "< >" to describe a crystal direction. Such usages
are well known in crystallography.The fabrication of miniaturized field-emission elements
became possible by the advancements of semiconductor fabrication
technologies. In particular, Spindt et al. disclosed the
fabrication of a cone-shaped field-emission cathode. (C. A.
Spindt, J. Appl. Phys, Vol. 47, p. 5248 (1976).The conventional method of fabricating a field-emission
cathode disclosed by Spindt et al. is shown in FIGS. 13(a)-13(d)
and is explained below. As shown in FIG. 13(a), the fabrication process is begun
with depositions of an insulation layer 402 and a metal layer 403
utilized as a gate electrode on a conductive substrate (silicon)
401. A round small hole 404 is then formed in said metal layer
403 and insulation layer 402 by using a conventional
photolithographic process. Next, as shown in FIG. 13(b), a
sacrificing layer 405, made of a material such as alumina, is
vacuum deposited on the substrate 401 at a shallow angle thereto
and the gate electrode. As a result, the diameter of gate
aperture 404 is substantially reduced. Then, as shown in FIG.
13(c), the metal layer 406, made of a material such as
molybdenum, is deposited perpendicularly to the substrate 401.
The gate-aperture diameter is gradually reduced as the metal
layer 406 is vacuum deposited, and a cone-shaped emitter
(cathode) 407 is formed within gate aperture 404 since the gate-aperture
becomes smaller as the deposition proceeds.Lastly, as shown in FIG. 13(d), the fabrication process is
completed by removing the sacrificing layer 405 and the
unnecessary metal layer 406 using an etching or lift-off method.
The field-emission cathode 407, thus obtained, is operable by
applying a high-voltage on gate electrode 403. This causes
electrons to be drawn into a vacuum from the cathode 407. The
electrons are collected by an anode (not shown) disposed at a
position opposing the cathode 407.An improvement of the above process is disclosed in Microelectronic
Engineering (vol. 2, No 1/ 04, «Fabrication of 0,4µm grid apertures for field-emission
array cathodes »), which uses two sacrificial layers so as to get a gate with
an aperture of 0,4µm.
