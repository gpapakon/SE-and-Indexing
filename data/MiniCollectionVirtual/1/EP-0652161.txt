<ABSTRACT>
A small goods carrier having a container (10) which has side walls (10a, 10b, 10c, 10d) with an at least partially peripheral seat (14) which is offset in the manner of a step into the interior (10') of the container relative to an upper container rim (16) and, on the container rim (16), an at least partially peripheral rest (16a), and having a removable lid (12) which covers the container (10) and has, along its edge (18), an inner shoulder (20), dimensioned such that it engages over the seat (14) on the side walls (10a, 10b, 10c, 10d) of the container (10), and a second shoulder (19) which is connected to the first shoulder (20) by a web (22), lies at least partially on the rest (16a), and at least partially terminates with the outer edge (24) of the container rim (16).

<CLAIMS>
A small goods container, with 

a container (10) which comprises 

-- side walls (10a, 10b, 10c, 10d) which have an at least sectionwise 
circumferential seat (14) which is offset with respect to an 

upper container margin (16) in a stepped manner into the container 
interior (10'), and 
-- an at least sectionwise circumferential support (16a) at the 
container margin (19), as well as 
a removable lid (12) for covering the container (10),
 
characterized in that 
the lid (12) along its margin (18) comprises 

-- an inner shoulder (20) which is dimensioned in such a manner that 
it overlaps the seat (14) at the side walls (10a, 10b, 10c, 10d) of 

the container (10), and 
-- a second shoulder (19) which is connected with the first shoulder 
(20) by means of a web (22), rests at least partially on the support 

(16a), and aligns at least partially with the outer edge (24) of the 
container margin (16). 
The small goods container according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the first shoulder (20) of the lid (12) and the seat (14) at 

the container (10) are dimensioned in such a manner that the first 
step -shaped shoulder (20) can be inserted into the container interior 

(10') with a clearance fit. 
The small goods container according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the second shoulder (19) of the lid (12) and the support 

(16a) are dimensioned in such a manner that the second shoulder (19)  
 

can be inserted into the container interior (10') with a sliding 
fit. 
The small goods container according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the container (10) has an essentially rectangular plan view 

and the seat (14) and the support (16) at the inside of the side 
walls (10a, 10b, 10c, 10d) of the container (10) as well as the 

first shoulder (20) and the second shoulder (19) at the margin of 
the lid (12) are formed at least in the respective corner areas. 
The small goods container according to Claim 1, characterized 

in that the outer surface of the container bottom (10e) is configured 
so as to be recessed relative to the side walls (10a, 10b, 10c, 

10d) by forming a step-shaped bearing (28) so that it can engage the 
upper area of the container interior (10') of another container (10) 

with the lid (12) fitted in order to stack several containers (10). 
The small goods container according to the previous claim, 
characterized in that the bearing (28) of one container (10) can at 

least partially rest on the container margin (16) of another container 
(10) with the lid (12) fitted. 
The small goods container according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that in the case of a not yet used lid (12) 

the distance between the first shoulder (20) of the lid (12) and the 
second shoulder (19) of the lid (12) is smaller than the distance 

between the seat (14) of the container (10) and the support (16a) of 
the container margin (16). 
The small goods container according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that the lid (12) is made from an elastic 

material.  
 
The small goods container according to one of Claims 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the step-shaped bearing (28) at the container 

bottom (10e) is dimensioned in such a manner that upon stacking a 
container (10) on a container (10) with its lid (12) fitted the web 

(22) between the first shoulder (20) and the second shoulder (19) of 
the lid (12) will be stretched so that the first shoulder (20) rests 

on the seat (14) and the second shoulder (19) rests on the support 
(16a). 
The small goods container according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that the lid (12) is made from polypropylene.
