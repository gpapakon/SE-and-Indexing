<ABSTRACT>
An improved fuse structure placed within an integrated 
circuit is provided. The fuse structure comprises a filament (18) 

extending over a raised or thickened insulating surface (14). When 
the filament is programmed or blown, the raised or thickened 

underlayer ensures the filament is blown at a select location 
near the sloped sidewall of the underlayer, and further ensures a 

clean separation of the filament and that the filament is less 
likely to regrow after it is blown. Various types of underlayer 

structures can be used to provide a filament extending in an 
elongated arcuate path which is raised above and thermally 

isolated from the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated circuit and more
particularly to an electrically programmable fuse structure.Integrated circuits are generally fabricated from a wafer of
silicon through a number of processing steps, including
photomasking, etching and diffusion, in order to create a pattern
of junctions and interconnections along the surface of the wafer.
One of the final steps in the manufacturing process is to coat
the entire surface with a metallization layer and then to
selectively etch away portions of the metallization, leaving the
desired interconnecting pattern. As defined herein,
"metallization" includes any conductive layer such as aluminum,
polycrystalline silicon, etc., which can be formed into an
interconnecting pattern and routed between active regions within
the wafer. In some instances, the user requires the
interconnecting pattern to be altered depending upon a target
application. If such is the case, the wafer may be processed
through the point of metallization and held in storage until the
target data pattern is defined. Once the pattern is defined, a
mask is then produced having the necessary pattern, and the final
pattern is photoprocessed and etched from the metallization via
the masking pattern to produce the user-specific wafer or
circuit. The above process is generally described as mask
programmable process or technique and is advantageous in reducing
lead time required for fabrication of user-specific circuits.Another technique often used to produce user-specific
circuits is to produce the wafer with all internal connections in
tact during the manufacturing process. The desired data pattern 
is then defined after final packaging rather than when the device
is manufactured. The user can "program" the circuit by applying
electrical input to certain select interconnect within the
circuit in order to customize the interconnect by "blowing" or
disconnecting them. Field-programmable, or electrically
programmable circuits are achieved using programmable links or
fuses.As defined herein, "link", "fuse" or "fuse structure" is a
thin conductive structure generally arranged as a filament which
can be broken at select locations by applying a measured
programmable voltage across the filament and/or current through
the filament. Accordingly, a fuse structure can be deposited at
select programmable areas across the wafer topography using
typical thin film deposition of metallization and subsequent
etching techniques to produce a relatively narrow conductive
structure at all potential
