<ABSTRACT>
A remote elevator monitoring system includes a 
master (18) associated with a building and a local (14) 

connected to the master. The local includes an 
electronic processor (28) which executes instructions 

for determining whether the master has transmitted a 
signal packet to the local within a time period 

selectable at will by an operator at the local. The time 
period is, for example, a period selected within a range 

of 0-255 days. Optionally, for example, the master is 
programmed to transmit a signal packet to the local at a 

selected time on the last day of the selected time 
period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to monitoring systems and,
more particularly, to remote systems for electronically
monitoring elevators.It is well known to utilize remote elevator monitoring
systems (REMS) for monitoring operating conditions in individual
elevators in widely diverse locations. Examples of such systems
are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,568,909 and
4,662,538. As shown in Fig. 1 which corresponds to Fig. 1 of
U.S. Patents '909 and '538, each REM system during normal
operation monitors individual elevators in remotely located
buildings 12 (REM buildings), transmits alarm and performance
information to associated local monitoring centers 14, and then
can retransmit the alarm and performance information from the
local centers to a central monitoring center 16. Each of the
buildings 12 includes a master data processing system 18 and one
or more slave data processing units 20 which together gather
operational information about corresponding elevators and
elevator shafts. The slaves 20 communicate with the master over
lines 22. Each master includes an electronic processor (e.g.,
microprocessor) coupled to a volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and to a
non-volatile memory (e.g., ROM, EEProm or the like). The non-volatile
memory includes instructions for evaluating performance
data and determining whether an alarm or alert condition exists 
according to Boolean logic equations (or a state machine model)
which are coded within the software. The software is stored
within the non-volatile memory and executed by the
microprocessor.Each master system 18 communicates with a modem 24 which
permits transmission of alarm and performance data to a modem 26
in the associated local monitoring center 14. Typically,
performance data (as opposed to alarm and/or alert data) is
transmitted by the master 18 responsive to a specific request
from the local monitoring center 14. The modem 26 exchanges
information with a local data processor 28 which informs service
personnel (e.g., service operator) of conditions in all of the
associated elevators being monitored. Service personnel are
informed (e.g., alerted) by means of any suitable output
device(s) such as a display (CRT), a printer 30 and/or an audible
warning device.Each local 14 typically includes a suitably programmed
personal computer system. As shown in Fig. 1A, each local data
processor 28 includes an electronic processor (e.g., a
microprocessor) coupled, via suitable buses etc., to a non-volatile
memory (e.g, ROM, EEProm or FLASH EEProm), a volatile
me

<CLAIMS>
A monitoring system, comprising:

two or more masters (18) located in one or more
buildings and including an electronic processor coupled

to a memory;
a master communication means (24) coupled to said
masters, for permitting transmission of an electronic

message signal;
a local processor (28) located outside of said
building and including a local electronic processor

connected to a local processor memory;
a local processor communication means (26),
connected to said local processor and coupled to said

master communication means, for permitting reception of
the electronic message signal;
an output device (30) connected to said local
electronic processor; and
an input device (K) connected to said local
electronic processor,characterised in that
each of said masters (18) has an individual
associated failure period; and further characterised by
said local processor being arranged to determine if
said associated failure period for each of said masters

is exceeded, and for causing information identifying
such of said masters whose failure period is exceeded to

be displayed on said output device; each said failure
period being a time period within which said local

processor must receive a message signal from said
associated master in order for said master to be deemed

operational and each said failure period being
individually selectable by an operator of said input

device during normal operation of said monitoring
system.
A monitoring system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said memory of said master includes instructions and

data for causing a transmission of an electronic message
signal to said local processor within said failure

period. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said
fail
ure period is any period between 0 and 365 days.
A system as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein
said input device is a keyboard.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
said output device is a printer.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
said message signal includes a Communication Check Alarm

message.
