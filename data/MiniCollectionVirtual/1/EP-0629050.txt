<ABSTRACT>
A variable length decoder device receives a stream of variable-length 
encoded data segments for successive transient storage. The storage is recurrently 

accessed under control of successive pointers. A decoder is fed by the storage and 
decodes a stream of data segments each from a respective encoded data segment. 

Furthermore, in step with the decoding a next pointer is produced as being directly 
derived from the accessing through reading of a localizer information. The latter again 

is produced in a preprocessor that sits before the storage, through localizing the data 
segments and indicating each segment by an associated localizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a variable length decoder device comprising
input means for receiving an input stream of variable-length encoded data segmentssequential storage means fed by said input means for transient storing of said data
segmentsaccessor means for repeatedly and selectively accessing said storage means under
control of successive pointer informationsand decoder means fed by said accessor means for reproducing an output stream of
decoded data segments each derived from a respective encoded data segment,said device having pointer generation means for in step with said reproducing
generating a next said pointer information.
Variable length coding has been found application in various technical fields such as
facsimile transmission, digital television transmission, and other technologies where
mathematical considerations allow for mapping each actual unencoded segment in such a
way on an encoded segment that the overall code length is diminished. In facsimile, for
example, successive transitions between black and white pixels are separated by strings
of uniformly valued pixels. By means of encoding these runlengths, substantial data
reduction is possible. In digital television, through statistical considerations on
occurrence frequencies of particular code configurations, the more probable ones are
mapped on relatively short code words, for so attaining an overall data reduction.
Similar advantages can be attained in an audio representation, such as used in the
Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) system. The term segment can relate to a word, or to
longer blocks, according to usage and feasibility. Earlier art on variable length decoders
has been published by S.Chang and D.G.Messerschmitt, "Designing High-throughput
VLC Decoder, Part I - Concurrent Video Architectures" in IEEE Transactions on
Circuits and Systems for Video technology, Vol. 2, No.2, June 1992, pp.187-196. The
decoder according to the citation will be discussed hereinafter more in detail with
reference to Figure 1. The known solution has an input FIFO and an output decoder. 
Since the FIFO buffer will contain compressed data, its size may remain relatively
small. It accepts data at the substantially constant rate of the channel but the Variable
Length Decoder itself requests data at a variable rate. This is caused by the constant
output rate of the apparatus in combination with the variable length of the encoded input
segments. In consequence, whereas the overall decoder device has both fixed rate input
and fixed rate output, the
