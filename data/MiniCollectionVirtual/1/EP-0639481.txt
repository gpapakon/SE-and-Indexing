<ABSTRACT>
A pretreatment for a decorative leather covering layer (38) 
overlying an air bag deployment opening in an automotive trim 

piece, the pretreatment results in an effective preweakening of the 
leather to be readily severed by the forced opening of an 

underlying hinged door panel. The pretreatment uses a hardening 
agent applied to the inside of the leather coveringlayer along a 

strip area (24A) extending in a pattern to match the unhinged sides of 
the door panel. The hardening agent saturates the leather in the 

strip area to 50-75% of the skin thickness. The leather covering 
layer has a notch groove (66) formed therein extending along the middle 

of the strip area in the door pattern, the hardening rendering the 
leather notch sensitive so as to be effectively preweakened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns arrangements for providing air bag 
deployment openings in automotive interior trim structure. 
Inflatable cushion devices (commonly referred to as "air bags") 
have been devised for automotive vehicles, in which one or more air 
bags are stowed in respective storage spaces located within the 
passenger compartment. Typically a driver's side air bag is stored 
in a compartment in the center of the steering wheel and a 
passenger's side air bag is stored in a compartment behind the 
instrument panel. Upon detection of a relatively severe collision, 
the air bag or bags are very rapidly inflated to be deployed in 
positions to cushion the driver and/or passengers from injury-causing 
contact with the interior structure of the auto. The air bags must be neatly stowed out of sight and so as to 
be resistant to tampering, yet able to deploy into the passenger 
compartment in an instant. This requires a sturdy closure panel 
for the deployment opening, which preferably minimizes the visual 
impression of the presence of the closure, and yet reliably opens 
when the air bag is deployed under the wide range of ambient 
temperature conditions for which the auto is designed for use, and 
over the entire useful life of the car. Such closures are usually opened by the force exerted by the 
inflating air bag, and the deployment of the air bag must not be 
appreciably slowed by resistance to the opening of the closure. 
The considerable force applied by the inflating air bag must not 
result in fragmentation or separation of the closure, lest debris 
be projected towards persons in the passenger compartment. The closure is of necessity disposed facing the interior of 
the passenger compartment, and thus must be aesthetically 
compatible with the auto interior trim. One approach has been to completely cover a closure door 
substrate with a seamless expanse of decorative vinyl skin covering 
extending completely over the adjacent instrument panel structure 
and/or steering wheel cover, which covering is ruptured along the  
 
perimeter of the opening when the closure is forced open. The vinyl covering is relatively tough and resistant to 
tearing. Preweakening of the covering has been utilized to facilitate 
severing by cutting of a notched groove into the inside of the 
cover in a pattern matching the sides of the closure door. U.S. 
patent 5,082,310 issued on January 21, 1992, for an "Arrangement 
for Providing an Air Bag Deployment Opening" describes a method for 
cutting a groove on the

<CLAIMS>
In a closure for covering an air bag deployment opening 
formed in an interior trim piece of an automotive vehicle, 

said closure including: 
a substrate member fit into said opening in said trim 

piece, said member defining a deployment door panel; 
hinging means attaching one side of said door panel to 

said trim piece and other sides of said door panel 
closely adjacent but unattached to portions of said trim 

piece adjacent said opening; 
a decorative covering skin comprised of a leather covering 

layer smoothly and uninterruptedly overlying said 
door panel and extending across said adjacent portions of 

said trim piece; 
an uninterrupted foam plastic layer lying beneath said 

leather covering layer and atop said door panel, extending 
across said other sides and over said adjacent portions 

of said piece completely filling a space between 
said covering layer and said door panel and adjacent portions 

of said trim piece; 
characterized by a pretreatment for said leather covering 

layer, said leather covering layer partially saturated 
from the inside with a hardening agent in a strip area 

extending to overlie said other sides of said door panel 
and said closely adjacent trim piece. 
The closure according to claim 1 wherein said leather 
covering layer is saturated with said hardening agent to 

a depth of 50-75% of its thickness. 
The closure according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said strip 
is approximately 0.5 inches wide. 
The closure according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said 
hardening agent comprises lacquer. 
A method of pretreating a leather covering layer smoothly 
and uninterruptedly overlying an air bag deployment opening 

in an automotive interior trim piece comprising: 
saturating said leather covering layer from the inside to 

at least a portion of its thickness with a hardening 
agent in an area extending along a strip extending in a 

pattern corresponding to the perimeter of said deployment 
opening; and, 

thereafter forming a notch groove extending along the inside 
of laid leather covering layer in said strip area in 

said corresponding pattern. 
The method according to claim 5 wherein said leather covering 
layer is saturated with said hardening agent to a 

depth of 10-75 % of its thickness.
