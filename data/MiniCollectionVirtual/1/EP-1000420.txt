<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for detecting presence characterised in that it comprises: reception means (6) including an element constituting an antenna; oscillating means (32, 38) receiving in input said reception means output signal, said oscillating means (32, 38) comprising a resonance stage (32) and an amplification stage (38) mounted in said resonance stage input and providing the oscillating means with a gain such that the oscillating means (32, 38) output signal oscillation frequency is modified when at least part of a person such as his hand is located in the immediate proximity of the element constituting the reception means antenna; processing means (14, 20, 26) for detecting a variation in the oscillating means (32) output signal oscillation frequency and for generating an information signal characterising detection of a presence when such frequency variation is detected.
