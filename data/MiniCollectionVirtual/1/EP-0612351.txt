 TITIE MICROBIAL PRODUCTION OF CIS-DIHYDRODIOL AND PHENOL DERIVATIVES OF BENZOCYCLOBUTENEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention:The present invention relates to the bioconversion of benzocyclobutene (BCB) to the 4,5-cis-dihydrodiol compound and the subsequent acid-catalyzed dehydration to form the 4-hydroxybenzocyclobutene compound. These novel compounds have utility as intermediates for the production of polymers.2. Description of the Related Art:Formation of cis-dihydrodiols from various aromatic hydrocarbons by bacteria has been described by D. T. Gibson et al., Biochemistry, vol. 9, No. 7, 1973, p. 1626+ and p. 1631+ and vol. 12, No.8, 1973, p. 1520+. A cis-dihydrodiol intermediate has been found to be a common metabolite in the bacterial degradation of a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, biphenyl, ethylbenzene, benzoic acid, phthalic acid, anthracene and phenanthrene. U.S. Patent No. 4,508,822 discloses the preparation of dihydrodiols of the general formula:R OHR'- -OH 

 here R and R1 are substituents which may be the same or different, such as halogen, alkyl, and the li e. Generally such dihydrodiols are of the 2,3-dihydrodiol configuration. That is, the hydroxy groups are Introduced directly adjacent to the ring substituent R. The only known exception to this general rule is the 4,5-dihydrodiol formed by some bacteria in the degradation of phthalic acid.U.S. Patent 4,520,103 describes the formation of the 2,3-dihydrodiol of indole as an intermediate in the production of indigo.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the formation of a dlhydrodiol resulting from bacterial byconversion of the aromatic hydrocarbon benzocyclobutene. Mutant strains of Rhodococcus organisms capable of converting benzocyclobutene to the 4,5-dihydrodiol have been developed. The growth of the mutant strain in the presence of benzocyclobutene results in the production of the 4,5-dihydrodiol intermediate of benzocyclobutene. Acid-catalyzed dehydration of the 4,5-dihydrodiol compound results in formation of 4-hydroxybenzocyclobutene. The corresponding sequential reactions are outlined below.
