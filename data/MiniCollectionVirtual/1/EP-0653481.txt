<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a granular 
detergent component having a bulk density of less than 400 

g/l comprising from 20% to 50% by weight of 
aluminosilicate; and optionally up to 50% by weight of a 

co-filler; and 0.05% to 2% by weight of anionic surfactant, 
especially is C14-C20 alkyl sulphate. 
The low bulk density component is preferably mixed with 
other components such as percarbonate, silicate, layered 

silicate, carbonate, bicarbonate, sesquicarbonate, 
sulphate, citrate or mixtures of these.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a granular detergent component 
having a bulk density of less than 400 g/l which comprises 
an anionic surfactant, zeolite, and, optionally, a cofiller. 
The invention also concerns a granular laundry 
detergent composition comprising the low bulk density 
component and, additionally, high density granular 
components, preferably including percarbonate. In conventional processes for preparing granular laundry 
detergents, spray drying of an aqueous slurry has been used 
to prepare granular components having a rather wide range 
of bulk densities depending on factors such as choice and 
level of ingredients used in the slurry, and processing 
conditions in the spray drying tower. However spray dried 
products on their own do not have high enough bulk density 
for todays granular detergents.  Recent trends in granular laundry detergents have seen 
increases in the bulk density of the finished products. 
Such high bulk densities offer greater convenience to the 
consumer, and environmental benefits due to, for example, 
reduced packaging requirements. These densities have been 
achieved by preparing and combining individual detergent 
components having high bulk densities.
 
Combinations of spray dried powders with other granular 
components are known in the prior art, some examples of 
which are cited below. EPA289312, published 2nd November 1988 discloses a process 
for the spray-drying of an aqueous slurry which contains 
carbonate and a crystal growth modifier. Optional post-treatments 
include spraying on of nonionic surfactant and 
mixing with other components including bleach, bleach 
activator, enzymes, etc. Such components require the 
presence of relatively high levels of organic materials, in 
particular anionic surfactants (in this application 
surfactants are present at a level of at least 5% by 
weight). WO9303131, published on 18th February 1993 discloses a 
spray dried component which comprises alkyl sulphate, 
aluminosilicate and silicate. Certain ratios of the 
components as well as processing conditions are specified. 
The spray dried component is then mixed with bleach, bleach 
activator, foam inhibitor, enzymes etc. The application  
 
considers the problem of replacing linear alkyl benzene 
sulponate (LAS) by the more biodegradable alkyl sulphates. 
Such components are difficult to spray dry and require the 
introduction of specific process parameters such as low 
temperature spray drying. High bulk density components which are desirable in todays
