<ABSTRACT>
A highly shrinkable packaging film comprising a 
stretched film of a resin composition comprising (A) 5 to 

60 parts by weight of a 1-butene-based polymer, (B) 30 to 
90 parts by weight of a propylene-ethylene-based random 

copolymer, and (C) 5 to 50 parts by weight of at least one 
member selected from a petroleum resin, a hydrogenated 

petroleum resin and a terpene resin. The packaging film of 
the present invention exhibits high flexibility, high heat 

shrinkage and low natural shrinkage, and after the shrink-packaging, 
it has beautiful appearance with no loosening or 

sagging. Also, it can be produced by stretching the film 
at a temperature lower than the temperature used in 

conventional packaging films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a highly shrinkable 
packaging film. More particularly, this invention relates 
to a packaging film which is highly shrinkable, and which 
exhibits excellent appearance and undergoes little 
loosening or sagging after the shrink packaging. Shrinkable films have been widely used for packaging 
industrial components, articles for daily use, foodstuffs, 
and the like since they are readily capable of tightly 
packaging articles of irregular configuration, and the thus 
packaged articles exhibit a good appearance. Shrinkable films are also used for packaging cans and 
bottles for cooling beverages, whiskeys and juices to avoid 
breakage of the bottles and to enable a decrease in the 
thickness of the bottles and cans to thereby save resources 
and energy, and to provide various designs with the 
commodity by multi-color printing of the film. For such shrinkable films, polyvinyl chloride films 
have been widely used since they are highly shrinkable, and 
once shrink-packaged, they undergo little decrease in 
shrinking stress to exhibit little loosening or sagging of 
the film. Polyvinyl chloride films, however, suffer from 
environmental problems, and polyolefin-based films have 
been developed as the substitutes for the polyvinyl 
chloride films. Such polyolefin-based films include films  
 
of a composition prepared by blending a propylene-ethylene 
copolymer or a propylene-α-olefin copolymer with a terpene 
resin or a hydrogenated petroleum resin as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 41-7958; and a composition 
prepared by blending an ethylene-propylene random copolymer 
or an ethylene-propylene-α-olefin random copolymer with a 
petroleum resin or a terpene resin and an ethylene-α-olefin 
resin as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 
62-4735. Such conventional polyolefin-based films are provided 
with a considerably high shrinkability at a low 
temperature. However, they are incapable of retaining 
their shrinkability after the shrink-packaging to undergo a 
considerable decrease in their shrinking stress, and 
consequently, experience loosening or sagging after a 
while. In other words, tight packaging of an article with 
such conventional films is difficult and the shrink-packaged 
articles would exhibit a poor appearance after a 
while. In view of the situation as described above, an object 
of the present invention is to provide a packaging film 
which is highly shrinkable and which experiences little 
loosening or sagging after the shrink-packaging.
