<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing a film laminate which contains a metal film web and a plastic film web, in the case of which the two film webs respectively have punched structures which are repeated at equal intervals in the longitudinal directions of the film webs and which are arranged at adjacent points in the film laminate, a prepunched film web and the second film web being continuously combined starting from one end in each case. In order to specify a process by means of which a prepunched plastic film web can be laminated together with a prepunched metal film web in such a way that, with as little effort as possible, the misalignment of the structures of the two film webs is kept as small as possible, after the film webs are brought together, the positions of position marks of the punched structures on the prepunched film web, which are adjacent to the second film web, are successively scanned and, when a predetermined position of the position markings has been reached, a punched structure is inserted in the region of the second film web in the region situated in front of the point of joining at a distance from the predetermined position which is a whole multiple of the distance between the punched structures on the metal film web. The invention also relates to a device for implementing the method.

A method for the production of a composite foil
containing a metal foil width and a second foil width, in

which the two foil widths (1;2) respectively have punched
structures (5) repeating themselves at regular intervals in

longitudinal direction of the foil width (1;2) and arranged
at adjacent sites in the composite foil, in which a pre-punched

foil width (1) and the second foil width (2) are
joined together continuously from the direction of one end

respectively, in which after the guiding to each other of
the foil widths (1;2), the location of position markings (6)

of the punched structures (5) of the pre-punched foil width
(1), lying on the second foil width (2), is scanned in

succession and after reaching a predetermined position of
the position markings (6), a punched structure (5) is

introduced into the region of the second foil width (2),
situated before the site of guiding to each other, at a

distance from the predetermined position, which corresponds
to an integral multiple of the interval in which the punched

structures (5) repeat themselves in the pre-punched foil
width (1), characterised in that the pre-punched foil width

(1) is of metal and the second foil width (2) is of plastic
and that the plastic foil width (2), before joining

together, is provided at least partially with position
markings (6) and that on scanning, the position markings (6)

of the foil width (1, 2) are arranged one over the other.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the position markings (6) of the plastic foil width (2) are

punched.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the foil widths are glued to each other after scanning.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that
the foil widths, after scanning, are fastened to each other 

in a first step by means of several adhesive points covering
a small area, and in a second step are glued to each other

over a large area.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that after guiding the foil widths to each

other, the position of the punched structures (5) of the
foil widths is monitored optically and that on exceeding a

predetermined deviation of the position of the punched
structures (5) of the plastic foil width (2) from the

position of the punched structures (5) of the metal foil
width (1), the distance between the scanned predetermined

position and the punching tool (11) for the plastic foil
width (2) is corrected.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the position markings (6) are

circular.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the scanning takes place by means of a pin.
A method according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the shape of the pin is adapted to the shape of the position

markings (6).
Apparatus for the production of a composite foil (3)
having a metal foil width and a plastic foil width, with

punched structures (5) repeating themselves at regular
intervals, which has a feeding- and guiding arrangement (8)

for the composite foil (3), a joining device (14) for the
secure connecting of the two foil widths (1;2) and feeding-and

guiding arrangements (7;8) for the guiding to each other

and joining together of the two foil widths (1;2), in which
behind the site of guiding of the two foil widths (1;2) to

each other, a scanning device (10) is arranged to detect the
position of the punched structure (5) of a pre-punched foil 

width (1), in which the distance of the scanning device (10)
from the punching tool (11) corresponds to an integral

multiple of the interval at which the punched structures (5)
of the pre-punched foil width (1) repeat themselves,

characterised in that this scanning device (10) is coupled
with a trigger of a punching tool (11) arranged before the

site of guiding the two foil widths (1;2) to each other.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterised in that
the scanning device (10) has a feeding arrangement.
Apparatus according to Claim 9 or 10, characterised in
that between the site of guiding the two foil widths to each

other and the scanning device (10), a monitor (9) is
arranged for the optical monitoring of the punched

structures (5).
Apparatus according to Claim 11, characterised in that
the monitor (9) has an arrangement for detecting by

measurement technology deviations between the position of
the punched structures (5) of the metal foil width (1) and

of the plastic foil width (2).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 9 to 12,
characterised in that the punching tool (11) has an

adjusting arrangement.
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterised in that
the punching tool (11) is adjustable in x- and y-direction.
