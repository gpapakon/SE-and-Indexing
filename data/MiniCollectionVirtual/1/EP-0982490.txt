<ABSTRACT>
A fuel vapor control apparatus determines whether the
concentration of fuel vapor in a space above the surface

of liquid fuel in the fuel tank (1) is less than a
predetermined concentration (step 104). When the

concentration of fuel vapor is less than the
predetermined concentration, the concentration of fuel

vapor in the fuel tank (1) is increased (step108, 109)
and, when the concentration of fuel vapor exceeds the

predetermined concentration, the increase of the
concentration of fuel vapor is stopped (step 110, 112).

Therefore, an amount of fuel flowing out of the fuel
tank (1) can be reduced while using a reduced amount of

energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No.
HEI 10-235875 filed on August 21, 1998 including the
specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety.The present invention relates to a fuel vapor
control apparatus for restraining fuel vapor from
flowing out of a fuel tank.Fuel vaporization is promoted in a fuel tank when
a space containing a relatively large amount of air
exists over a surface of liquid fuel in the fuel tank.
The fuel tank is connected to the atmosphere to allow
the surface of liquid fuel to readily lower as fuel in
the fuel tank is consumed. Therefore, fuel vaporizes in
the fuel tank and fuel vapor flows out into the
atmosphere, which is environmentally unfavorable. A
related-art technology for reducing an amount of fuel
vapor that flows out of the fuel tank into the
atmosphere by cooling the fuel vapor to liquefy it and
return it to the fuel tank is disclosed in, for example,
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. HEI 6-147029. In the technology disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. HEI 6-147029, the amount of
fuel vapor is temporarily reduced by cooling fuel vapor
extracted from the fuel tank to condense and return it
to the fuel tank. However, corresponding to the reduced
amount of fuel vapor, fuel vapor is generated in the
fuel tank, and again flows out of the fuel tank.
Therefore, it is necessary to control fuel vaporization
in the fuel tank in order to restrain the outflow of
fuel vapor from the fuel tank. Since fuel more readily
vaporizes as the temperature in the fuel tank becomes
higher, the fuel tank temperature needs to be kept low
in order to restrain fuel vaporization. Therefore, in
order to restrain fuel vaporization in a conventional
fuel tank, energy is needed in large quantities to
maintain low temperatures in the fuel tank. Further, it is referred to WO 99/61108 A which is
considered to be comprised in the state of the art
pursuant to Art. 54 (3) EPC. The WO 99/61108 A discloses
a fuel vapor control apparatus that has a feedback
control to maintain the fuel/air mixture present in a
ventilated space defined above the surface of liquid fuel
in a fuel tank above the flammability range. A fuel pump
and a piping system with nozzles are arranged to inject
fuel into the ventilated space when the fuel/air mixture
concentration is between the upper and lower limits of
the flammability range.It is an object of the present invention to reduce
the amount of fuel vapor that flows out of a fuel tank
while requiring a
