<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid molecule having an RNA substrate cleaving enzymatic activity which cleaves a separate RNA substrate at a cleavage site. The nucleic acid molecule includes an RNA substrate binding portion which base pairs with the RNA substrate only 3' of the cleavage site, and an enzymatic portion (which may include a part or all of the RNA substrate binding portion) having the enzymatic activity. The nucleic acid molecule is able to base pair with the RNA substrate only 3' of the cleavage site, and cause cleavage of the RNA substrate at that cleavage site. The nucleic acid molecule can be either linear or circular. A general method for forming circular RNA in vivo and in vitro is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONEnzymatic RNA MoleculesBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to enzymatic RNA molecules, sometimes termed ribozymes, able to cleave other RNA molecules. The U.S. government may have rights in the invention which was made in part with support from theN.I.H. (GM-40689) .Cech et al., U.S. Patent 4,987,071, describe various RNA molecules which have one or more enzymatic activities, e.g. , an endoribonuclease activity which acts to cleave other RNA molecules. Such activity is termed intermolecu- lar cleaving activity. These enzymatic RNA molecules are derived from an RNA molecule which has an activity which results in its own cleavage and splicing. Such self- cleavage is an example of an intramolecular cleaving activity.Perrotta and Been, 18 Nucleic Acids Research 6821, 1990, describe a self-cleaving domain from the genomic RNA of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) . They describe the minimal sequence required for cleavage at the self-cleavage site of the HDV genomic strand, and present evidence that sequences that fall outside of this domain can inhibit the cleavage reaction. They state:It has often been possible with other self- cleaving and self-splicing RNAs to physically separate the 'ribozyme' into enzyme and sub¬ strate portions. For HDV self-cleaving RNA, similarly successful separations may be possi¬ ble. If the single nucleotide required 5' to the break site is viewed as part of the sub- strate, then the remainder of the substrate and the entire catalytic portion must reside in the sequence 3' of the break site. Our results indicate that, for self-cleavage of the HDV 

 genomic RNA, significant interactions with 'substrate' sequence 5' to the site of cleavage may be limited to the uridine at the break site. Although the requirement for a longer sequence might be anticipated, self-cleavage of the vLTSV RNA requires only 3 nt 5' to the break site and there is precedent for even shorter sequences flanking the sites of cleavage in other RNA catalyzed reactions. For example, a ribozyme derived from the Tetra.hyn.ena group I intron catalyzes the cleavage of substrates as small as dinucleotides. The same ribozyme is even capa¬ ble of acting as a phosphotransferase and an acid phosphatase, reactions involving a terminal phosphate.
