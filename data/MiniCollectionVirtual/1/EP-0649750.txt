<ABSTRACT>
To assure that the space efficiency of a 
recording apparatus can be improved, the length of 

each of cables to be electrically connected to a 
mechanism section can be optimized, and the 

recording apparatus having excellent handling 
properties can be produced with small dimensions at 

a reduced cost, a controlling section 5 for 
controlling a mechanism section substantially 

composed of an automatic feeding section 1, a 
conveying section 2, a discharging section 3 and a 

recording section 4 each of which is associated with 
a recording operation to be performed by the 

recording apparatus is arranged above the mechanism 
section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
recording apparatus. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a recording apparatus of the
type mainly usable for outputting recording
informations each representing a character, an image
or the like onto a recording medium.In recent years, since a so-called note type
personal computer has been developed to a level
sufficient for practical use, a variety of further
development works are positively conducted for
providing the note type personal computer having a
higher functional capability with smaller
dimensions. In addition, since a recording
operation can be performed with the note type
personal computer by using plural kinds of colored
inks owing to the successful development of a
colored liquid crystal display, and moreover, each
note type personal computer can be produced at a
reduced cost, a number of note type personal
computers have been heretofore shipped to a
commercial market for a short period of time. In
the circumstances as mentioned above, many sincere
requests have been raised from many users for
providing a recording apparatus, i.e., a typical
peripheral equipment for the personal computer which
assures that a color recording operation can be 
performed therewith, and moreover, it can be
designed and constructed with smaller dimensions at
a reduced cost while exhibiting improved handling
properties. To sufficiently satisfy these requests,
many proposal have been made for providing a various
kind of recording apparatus having an ink jet
process employed therefor in association with a note
type personal computer of the foregoing type.A conventional recording apparatus is
substantially composed of a carriage driving section
for reciprocably displacing a carriage having a
recording head mounted thereon, a conveying section
for conveying a recording medium across the
recording apparatus, a controlling section for
processing data and informations outputted from the
personal computer so as to drive the recording head,
the carriage driving section and the conveying
section for forming characters, images or the like
on the recording medium, and a power source for
feeding electricity to the recording head, the
carriage driving section, the conveying section and
the controlling section, and each of the
aforementioned sections constituting the
conventional recording apparatus is accommodated as
a unit in a common casing for the conventional
recording apparatus.However, the carriage driving section, the
conveying section, the controlling

<CLAIMS>
A recording apparatus comprising:

a mechanism section (2, 4) for effecting a recording
operation, said mechanism section (2, 4) comprising a carriage

(402) for detachably mounting and scanning at least one of an
ink jet head (401) and an ink tank (405) storing ink for supply

to said ink jet head (401), driving means for driving said
carriage (402), and recording medium conveying means (2) for

conveying a recording medium (S), wherein said ink jet head
(401) is mounted on said carriage (402) such that said ink jet

head (401) ejects ink to the recording medium (S); and
a controlling section (5) for controlling said mechanism
section (2, 4), said controlling section (5) comprising a

plurality of circuits, each being used for a controlling
operation for said mechanism section (2, 4), wherein said
