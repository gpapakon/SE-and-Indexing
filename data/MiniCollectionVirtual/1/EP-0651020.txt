<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heat-curing 
silicone rubber composition that exhibits an excellent 
mold releasability and is highly qualified for use in 
cavity-based moldings that have complex or intricate 
shapes. Silicone rubber compositions are known to 
have generally poor mold-release properties, which 
results in fissuring in the rubber during de-molding 
and mold staining during long-term operations. One 
method to solve this problem consists of the addition 
of an internal release agent to the silicone rubber 
composition. Examples of these internal release agents 
are stearic acid, zinc stearate, and calcium stearate. However, in the case of fabrication of 
intricately shaped silicone rubber moldings, for 
example moldings which present projections or have 
hollow bent or curved structures, release from the mold 
is poor even for silicone rubber compositions that 
contain internal release agent. This has resulted in 
substantial product defect rates due to breakage of 
projections on the molding or the facile development of 
cracks in the molding. As a result of extensive investigations 
directed at solving these problems, we have 
surprisingly found that excellent mold-release 
properties are exhibited by silicone rubber 
compositions prepared by the addition of water and a 
particular type of compound to a silicone rubber base 
compound. Our invention introduces a highly mold-releasable 
heat-curing silicone rubber composition 
whose mold-release properties are substantially 
improved when compared to those of previous silicone 
rubber compositions.  A highly mold-releasable, heat-curing 
silicone rubber composition whose mold-release 
properties are substantially improved over those of 
previous silicone rubber compositions is disclosed. 
Said heat-curing silicone rubber composition 
comprising: 
(A) silicone rubber base compound composed of 
(a) 100 weight parts organopolysiloxane gum with the 
average unit formula RaSiO(4 - a)/2 where R denotes 
substituted and unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon 
groups and a is 1.95 to 2.05 and (b) 10 to 100 weight parts reinforcing filler,  (B) 0.025 to 5 weight parts higher fatty acid or metal salt 
of a higher fatty acid, (C) 0.05 to 5 weight parts water, and (D) 0.1 to 10 weight parts organoperoxide. The silicone rubber base compound, component (A) of the 
present invention, is the base ingredient of our silicone rubber 
composition and is well known. Component (a) in this silicone 
rubber base compound is an organopolysiloxane gum. The group R
