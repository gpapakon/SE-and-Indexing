<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing high-purity isobutyramide from isobutyryl 
chloride and ammonia, which comprises adding ammonia to 

a solution of isobutyryl chloride in toluene or xylene at 
-15° to 30°C, subsequently heating the mixture, removing the 

ammonium chloride which is formed by hot filtration, and 
allowing isobutyramide to crystallize out of the organic 

solution.
