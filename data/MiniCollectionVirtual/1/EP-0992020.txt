<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a surface pattern (1) comprising microscopically fine relief structures (9) which diffract visible light. When the surface pattern (1) is illuminated in a perpendicular manner with white light (10), the surface pattern (1) appears from a first viewing direction as a surface with bright and dark regions. The extension and/or position and/or number of bright and dark regions changes as the viewing angle ( theta ) changes. Preferably, the contour of the surface pattern (1) is selected such that the extension or position of the bright regions changes markedly when the viewing angle ( theta ) changes.
