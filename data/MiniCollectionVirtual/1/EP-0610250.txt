<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a vaccine 
for the protection of pigs against Porcine 
Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), a biological 
composition comprising viruses of a novel virus type, 
a method for the preparation of viral antigen derived 
from viruses of this novel virus type, a method for 
the detection of antibodies to PRRS-virus, as well as 
a diagnostic test kit to be used in this method. A new porcine disease has attacked over 5.000 
North European pig farms since late 1990. This disease 
is now called Porcine Reproductive Respiratory 
Syndrome (PRRS). First, identified in Germany in 
December of 1990, the problem became increasingly 
critical in the beginning of 1991. In January and 
February of 1991 the disease spreaded to The 
Netherlands and Belgium. Outbreaks have also been 
reported from Spain. 
It is anticipated that the disease will become very 
costly from an economic standpoint, comparable or even 
worse than Aujeszky's Disease. The principal clinical signs in sows are anorexia 
and late abortion up to day 110 of pregnancy. With 
piglets a high incidence of stillborn weak piglets in 
addition to respiratory problems are observed. In 
fatteners chronic pneumonia and increased mortality 
occurs.  
 In order to develop a vaccine to protect pigs 
against PRRS or to develop a diagnostic method to 
determine infection in pigs, the causative agent of this 
disease has to be identified. However, up to now only a 
few characteristics of the causative agent have been 
disclosed, such as its viral nature, haemagglutination 
properties, buoyant density and growth characteristics 
in vitro (Wensvoort, G. et al., Vet. Quaterly 13, 121-130, 
1991). International patent applications WO 92/21375, WO 
93/06211, WO 93/03760 and European patent application EP 
0529584 (Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health Inc.) are 
conflicting applications available as prior art for the 
present invention under Article 54(3) and (4) EPC. 
WO 92/21375 (Stichting Centraal Diergeneeskundig 
Instituut) discloses the identification of the causative 
agent, called Lelystad Agent, of the Mystery Swine 
Disease (MSD). Additionally, the use of this agent for 
the preparation of vaccines and diagnostic tests is 
proposed. Both WO 93/03760 (Collins et al.) and EP 
0529584 disclose the isolation of an US isolate, i.e. 
isolate ATCC-VR 2332, and identify this isolate as the 
causative agent of MSD in the US. The preparation of an 
attenuated MSD vaccine by passaging the isolate on a 
cell culture is also disclosed
