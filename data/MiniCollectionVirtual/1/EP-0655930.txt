<ABSTRACT>
A system and method is provided which substantially eliminates the effect of air entrapped in tubing (16) for delivering a liquid from a container (12). The inner diameter (d) of the tubing is selected such that the gravitational force of the liquid from the container (12) is greater than the surface tension of the liquid. A release agent may be used as a coating layer (24) on the interior wall in addition to or alternatively from an expanded diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
 S P E C I F I C A T I O NTITLE SELF-VENTING FLUID SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention generally relates to fluid delivery systems and more particularly to gravity fed fluid delivery systems.Of course, it is known to provide containers for storing liquids. In, for example, the medical industry, it is known to provide flexible containers for containing solutions, such as, for example, medicaments, feeding products or the like. Such containers house solutions that can be delivered to a patient requiring an enteral solution, peritoneal dialysis, intravenous solutions, or the like.Solutions contained within an interior of a flexible container are typically provided to a patient, or some other site, through a length of tubing connected to a port of the container. The tube provides fluid communication between the interior of the container and the patient or some other environment. The solution is typically gravity fed, but may be pumped or otherwise fed, to the patient from the container. To this end, the container is usually suspended.Prior to initiation of the feeding of the solution, a portion of the solution must be drained from the tubing to expel air, generally in the form of air pockets or bubbles, in the system. Draining of the solution from the container results in a partial waste of the solution which is otherwise to be delivered to the patient.A further issue that arises, especially when products are fed through a tube by gravity, is that air 

can be entrapped generally in the form of air bubbles, and escape from the tubing inversely to the direction of the solution flowing through the tubing. The air bubbles in the tubing undesirably result in an uneven flow of solution from the bag to the patient. Further, excessive entrapped air in the line may often terminate flow of solution to the patient for a dangerous period of time during delivery. Indeed, air entrapment can prevent any fluid flow through the tube. To counteract fluid flow problems, it is known to vent the containers or tubing. However, this typically results in an open system that can compromise the sterility of the procedure.A need, therefore, exists for an improved fluid delivery system eliminating the problem of air entrapment.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A fluid delivery system is provided having a fluid delivery tubing in fluid communication with an interior of a container. The tubing effectively provides a self- venting system eliminating air entrapment therein, allowing continuous flow of the solution from the

I CLAIM AS MY INVENTION:
1. A delivery system for allowing liquid to be fed from a container to a second environment through a tube in a closed system comprising: a container having an interior; and a tubing in fluid communication_with the interior of the container wherein the tubing is so constructed and arranged to reduce the surface tension of the liquid in the tubing such that the surface tension is less than a gravitational force on the liquid, thereby preventing air entrapment in the tubing.
2. The system of Claim 1 wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential wall manufactured such that the gravitational force on the liquid is greater than the surface tension of the liquid.
3. The system of Claim 1 wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential wall coated with a release agent.
4. The system of Claim 1 wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential wall including a release agent integrally formed therein.
5. The system of Claim 3 wherein the release agent is silicone.
6. The system of Claim 4 wherein the release agent is silicone.
7. The system of Claim 1 wherein the liquid is gravity fed from the container.
8. A delivery system for feeding, by gravity, a liquid to a patient comprising: a container having an interior; and a tubing in fluid communication with the interior for transferring the liquid from the interior to the patient wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential 


wall manufactured such that gravitational force on the liquid is greater than the surface tension of the liquid.
9. The system of Claim 8 wherein the surface tension is reduced by coating the wall with a release agent.
10. The system of Claim 8 wherein the surface tension is reduced by integrally forming the wall with a release agent.
11. The system of Claim 9 wherein the release agent is silicone.
12. The system of Claim 8 wherein the inner circumferential wall has a circumference such that the gravitational force on the liquid is greater than the surface tension. 13. A method for providing a liquid house within an interior of a container to a second site comprising the steps of: suspending the container above the second site such that the liquid can be fed by gravitational force; and providing a tubing for transferring of the liquid from the interior to the second site wherein the tubing is constructed and arranged to eliminate air entrapment within the tubing.
14. The method of Claim 13 wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential wall manufactured such that the gravitational force on the liquid is greater than the surface tension of the liquid.
15. The method of Claim 13 wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential wall coated with a release agent.
16. The method of Claim 13 wherein the tubing has an inner circumferential wall integrally formed with a release agent. 


 17. The method of Claim 15 wherein the release agent is silicone.
18. The method of Claim 16 wherein the release agent is silicone. 19. The method of Claim 13 wherein the inner circumferential wall has a circumference that is sufficiently large that the gravitational force on the liquid is greater than the surface tension of the liquid.
20. The method of Claim 13 wherein the liquid includes a medicament and the second site is a patient.
