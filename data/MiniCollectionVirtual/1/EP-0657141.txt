<ABSTRACT>
For interstitial thermal therapeutic treatment of biological tissue, in which the radiation of a laser is conducted into the tissue via a fibre optical waveguide within a radiation period to produce a coagulation necrosis, the laser output is reduced continuously or stepwise during the radiation period.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the interstitial thermo-therapeutic treatment of biological tissue,
comprising a continuous-wave laser (1), particularly a Nd:YAG laser, with an optical

waveguide (2) via which laser radiation can be led into the tissue to be treated over an
irradiation period in order to produce a tissue necrosis, 
characterised in that
 means (3) are
present which reduce the radiation output of the laser continuously or stepwise during the

treatment period, in a manner which is controlled with respect to time, so that the
carbonisation temperature of the tissue is not exceeded within the treatment period.
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 means (3) are present which
reduce the radiation output of the laser (1) continuously or stepwise during the treatment

period so that the temperature inside a coagulation necrosis remains slightly below the
carbonisation temperature of the irradiated tissue.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the means (3) adjust
the initial radiation output of the laser (1) within a treatment period depending on the

destruction threshold for the optical waveguide fibres (2).
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 means (3)
are present for reducing the radiation output of the laser (1) within an irradiation period

according to 1/t
3
, wherein t denotes time.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 means (3)
are present which reduce the radiation output of the laser (1) continuously or stepwise during

a treatment period from a maximum of 25 watts at the start of the treatment period to a
minimum of 5 watts at the end of the treatment period.
