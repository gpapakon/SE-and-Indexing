<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a flat or cylindrically structured applicator with microslot(s) for the emission or the reception of high-frequency signals. Applicator characterised in that it consists mainly, on the one hand, of a substrate support layer (2) of a flexible or rigid dielectric material, on the other hand of a screen (3) advantageously in the form of a layer or of a sheet of conducting material, provided with at least one aperture (8,9) and arranged on the face (5) of the said support layer (2) turned towards the tissues (fabrics) to be treated and, finally, of at least two radiating or receiving elements (6) in the form of films or thin deposits of a conducting material, arranged on the face (4) of the support layer (2) opposite to that (5) carrying the screen (3) and fed separately with high-frequency signals or delivering high-frequency signals picked up separately.
