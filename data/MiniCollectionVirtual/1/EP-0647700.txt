<ABSTRACT>
A highly effective fuel additive composition for 
control of intake valve deposits is described. It comprises 


(a) a gasoline-soluble Mannich reaction product of (i) a 
high molecular weight alkyl-substituted phenol wherein the 

alkyl group has a number average molecular weight of from 
about 600 to about 3000, (ii) amine, and (iii) aldehyde; and 
(b) a gasoline-soluble poly(oxyalkylene) compound having a 
viscosity in its undiluted state of at least about 70 cSt at 

40°C and at least about 13 cSt at 100°C. These components 
are proportioned such that there are from about 0.2 to about 

5 parts by weight of active Mannich base in (a) per part by 
weight of (b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel additive compositions
that can be used for control of intake valve deposits
without significantly affecting octane requirement increase
in the engine.Over the years considerable work has been devoted to
additives for controlling (preventing or reducing) deposit
formation in the fuel induction systems of spark-ignition
internal combustion engines. In particular, additives that
can effectively control intake valve deposits represent the
focal point of considerable research activities in the field
and despite these efforts, further improvements are desired.
Among relatively recent efforts along these lines is U.S.
5,242,469 and published Canadian patent application
2,089,833.The additive systems described in U.S. 5,242,469
comprise an ester and at least one dispersant component
chosen from certain monosuccinimides, bis(succinimides),
polyolefin polyamines, and benzylamine derivatives. The
benzylamine derivatives appear to be Mannich-type detergents*. These additive combinations may further contain a
polyoxyalkylene glycol or derivative thereof having a
molecular weight of 500-5000, preferably 1000-3000. 
Also, a specified type of lubricating oil fraction may be
included in the additive mixture. The polyoxyalkylene
glycol derivatives referred to in the text of the patent
include the ethers, esters and ether aminoacid esters of
the polyoxyalkylene glycol.Canadian patent application 2,089,833 bearing a
publication date of August 21, 1993 describes a similar
additive system. In particular, the gasoline is to contain
(a) from 75 to 450 ppmw of a specified group of Mannich
base detergents in combination with (b) from 75 to 175 ppmw
of an oil-soluble poly(oxyalkylene) alcohol, glycol or
polyol or mono or di ether thereof, wherein the weight
ratio of (a) to (b) in the mixture is at least 0.43.It has now been discovered that oil-soluble
poly(oxyalkylene) alcohols, glycols or polyols or mono or
di ethers thereof do not yield equivalent results on intake
valve cleanliness when used in conjunction with a Mannich
base detergent, and that for reasons not presently
understood, the viscosity properties of the
poly(oxyalkylene) component appear to have a profound
effect on the intake valve cleanliness performance of the
overall composition.Accordingly, in one of its embodiments, this invention
provides, a fuel-soluble additive composition which
comprises
a) a gasoline-soluble Mannich reaction product of
(i) a high molecular weight alkyl-substituted
phenol wherein the alkyl group has a number
a
