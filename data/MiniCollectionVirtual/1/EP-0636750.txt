<ABSTRACT>
A support stand for installation into dry-construction stand walls exhibits a mounting frame which is formed from a fastening crossmember (18), from at least two flushing-cistern retaining members (19), from the pipe clamp (20) for a flushing pipe, and from the pipe clamp (21) for a WC-discharge-pipe elbow. The support stand serves for receiving a wall-mounted WC or a wall-mounted bidet, a built-in flushing cistern or a built-in flushing valve, a flushing pipe and a discharge-pipe elbow or the like. On its upwardly directed legs, the fastening crossmember (18) has forwardly projecting spacer pieces, which are of such a length that the vertical members fitted at the outer ends rest, by means of their front surface, on the rearside of the crossmember (7), provided with at least two downwardly projecting plates (15), and can be screwed thereon. The threaded bolts in the upwardly directed legs of the fastening crossmember (18), said legs being provided with threaded holes, are vertically adjustable in the slots (12) of the support-frame members (5) and can be secured by the nuts. The rear edges of the two vertical support-frame members (5), which are angled off to the rear in the form of a U, run vertically upwards, sloping to the front.

A support stand for sanitary devices, in particular 
wall-mounted WCs or bidets, for installation into dry-construction 

support walls including an assembly frame 
formed by an assembly cross beam (18), a minimum of two 

cistern stiles (19), one pipe clip (20) for a flushing 
pipe and one pipe clip (21) for a WC outlet elbow (4) to 

which a sanitary device (1), a fitted cistern (2) or 
fitted flushing valve, a flushing pipe (3) and an outlet 

pipe (4) or similar are fitted, characterised in that the 
assembly cross beam (18) includes spacers (25) projecting 

forward on its upward leg, having a suitable length to 
allow the outer ends of the attached vertical stiles (19) 

to contact by each of their front faces the rear of the 
cross beam (7), provided with a minimum of two downward 

projecting plates (15), which may be bolted to the same, 
that the threaded pins (13) may be bolted into the upward 

leg of the assembly cross beam (18), provided with 
threaded holes, thus allowing these to be adjustable in 

elongated holes (12) of the support frame stiles (5) and 
lockable by nuts (32) and that the rear edges of the two 

vertical U-shaped stiles (5) of the support frame angled 
towards the rear are vertically slanted upwards and 

forward. 
A support stand according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the plates (15) are attached to the cross beam (7) 

and project upwards. 
A support stand according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the rear edges of the two vertical, U-shaped stiles 

of the support frame angled towards the rear are provided 
vertically and parallel upwards and are welded in the 

bottom section by a minimum of one gusset (17) to the 
base plate (6).  

 
A support stand according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the base plates (22) consist of a metal sheet 

material bent in an angle and the bent rear angle is 
directed upwards. 
A support stand according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the pipe clip (21) is connected to a plate (30) bent 

towards the rear and including an elongated hole, guided 
by a square collar of the fastening bolt (31) in an 

elongated hole stamped into the horizontal leg of the 
assembly cross beam (18) directed towards the rear, 

allowing forward and backward sliding movements without 
being twisted.
