(11) with modulus of elasticity of 600 kg/mmÂ² or 
more wound spirally nearly parallel to the tyre 

equator, and a bead apex (9) having a substantially 
triangular section disposed on the bead core (5) 

between the main part and turned up part (6b) of 
the carcass, said tread (2) having a width (TW) 

between tread edges (E1,E2) in the axial direction 
which is larger than the maximum width of the tyre 

in the axial direction at the side walls (3) and 
the tread surface being an approximately arc shape  

 
in the tyre meridian section, characterised in that 

the bead apex (9) of a soft apex part SA composed 

of a soft rubber composition with a JISA hardness 
of 50 to 60 degrees extending radially outwardly 

from a bottom surface adjacent to the bead core 
(5) and a hard apex part HA composed of a hard 

rubber composition with JISA hardness of 70 to 95 
degrees extending radially outwardly from the soft 

apex part SA, a height hl of the radially upper end 
P1 of the soft apex part SA from a bead base is 

0.20 to 0.40 times a height h0 of the tread end 
from the bead base (BL), and a height h2 of the 

radially upper end P2 of the hard apex part HA from 
the bead base (BL) is 0.50 to 1.25 times the height 

h0 of the tread end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radial tyre for 
a motor cycle capable of maintaining the ride 
comfort while improving steering stability and 
durability in high speed running. In the recent years, along with improvements to 
highway networks and higher vehicle speeds, radial 
tyres have been introduced for the motor cycles. Such a radial tyre for a motor cycle comprises a 
carcass with a radial structure and a belt layer. 
To improve the ride comfort Japanese Patent 
Publication Hei. 3-8961 proposed using a belt 
layer of belt cords arranged parallel to the tyre 
equator instead of the conventional crossed belt 
ply in which the cords of two plies are crossed to 
each other. The parallel belt ply is, as compared with the 
crossed belt ply, smaller in rigidity and is 
intended to improve the ride comfort by lowering 
the bending rigidity in the radial direction of the  
 
tread ground contacting surface and thus to improve 
the ground contacting performance. The parallel belt ply construction is, however, 
accompanied with a decrease of lateral rigidity of 
the tread. Further, since the radial tyre has a 
radial arrangement of carcass cords, it is inferior 
in the lateral rigidity of the entire tyre, causing 
a "flabby" phenomenon when turning, in particular, 
and hence the steering stability tends to be 
sacrificed. Therefore, in order to enhance the rigidity of tyre 
side walls, Japanese Patent Publication Hei. 3-8961, 
also, proposes to heighten the turned up 
portion of the carcass, employ a hard rubber with a 
hardness of 60 degrees or more as the bead apex 
rubber, and heighten the bead apex rubber. For 
example EP-A-0456438, showing a tyre according to the preamble of claim 1, 
proposes to extend the apex 
rubber beyond the height of the sidewall such that 
its upper end underlies the axially outer part of 
the breaker. Further, it has been proposed to 
employ a cord reinforcing layer covering the turned 
up portion in the tyre side wall.  
 However, if the hardness of the bead apex rubber is 
set at 63 degres Shore A (60 degrees JISA) or more 
and the height of the bead apex rubber is 
heightened in order to improve the rigidity of the 
side wall itself to a level sufficient for steering 
stability, since the bead apex rubber extends from 
the bead core in one united body, the longitudinal 
rigidity of tyre becomes so high that the ride 
comfort is poor. Still more, the heat generation of 
the bead increases, and durability tends to 
decline. Incidentally, since the carcass cords are
