<ABSTRACT>
A vertical impulse detecting circuit 104 detects the 
difference between a level of data of a present horizontal 

line of an input composite picture signal and a level of data 
of each of a horizontal line a plurality of lines ahead and a 

horizontal line a plurality of lines behind. Either an output 
signal of a three-line chrominance signal separating circuit 

100 or an output signal of a horizontal chrominance signal 
separating circuit 101 is selected as a chrominance signal 

(CC) that is supplied to a subtracter 105 according to an 
output signal of the vertical impulse detecting circuit 104.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Y/C separating circuit 
suitably for use with NTSC system and PAL system and for 
precisely separating a luminance signal and a chrominance 
signal from an input composite picture signal with small data 
correlation between horizontal lines of the input composite 
picture signal. Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing a construction of a 
conventional separating circuit that is used with the NTSC 
system and separates a luminance signal and a chrominance 
signal from an input composite picture signal. Referring to 
Fig. 9, the input composite picture signal is supplied to a 
band-pass filter BPF 52 and a one-horizontal-period (1H) 
delaying circuit 50. An output signal of the delaying circuit 
50 is supplied to a band-pass filter BPF 53 and a 
one-horizontal-period (1H) delaying circuit 51. An output 
signal of the delaying circuit 51 is supplied to a band-pass 
filter BPF 54. The band-pass filters BPF 52, 53, and 54 extract 
chrominance signal components of these horizontal lines. 
These output signals that are output from the band-pass  
 
filters BPF 52, 53, and 54 are referred to as H0, H1, and H2, 
respectively. The signal H1 (= b) is referred to as present 
data. To match a chrominance subcarrier phase of the signal 
H1 with a chrominance subcarrier phase of each of the signals 
H0 and H2, the phases of H0 and H2 are inverted by inverters 
58 and 59 and output as signals a and c, respectively. Adders 
56 and 57 extract signals d and e, where d = (a + b) / 2 and e 
= (b + c) / 2. The signals a, b, c, d, and e are supplied to 
a five-tap median filter 60 that selects a signal with third 
largest signal level and outputs it as a chrominance signal 
(C). A subtractor 15 subtracts the chrominance signal (C), 
which is output from the median filter 60, from an output 
signal of the 1H delaying circuit 50 and outputs a luminance 
signal (Y). However, when the correlation of data between 
horizontal lines of an input composite picture signal is 
small, the median filter 60 may not extract a required 
chrominance signal. In this case, a dot interference takes 
place in the luminance signal (Y), which has been generated by 
subtracting the output of the median filter 60 from the output 
of the delaying circuit 50. The construction of a Y/C separating circuit for use with 
the PAL system is the same as that for use with the NTSC 
system except that delaying circuits 50 and 51 delay 
respective input signals by 2H instead of 1H. As with the Y/C 
separating circuit for use with
