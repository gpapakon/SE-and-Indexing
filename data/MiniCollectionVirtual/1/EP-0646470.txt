<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printing apparatus has a casing (1) 
which is divided into upper and lower regions by a 

dividing wall (60). In the lower region, between the 
dividing wall and the base of the casing is an ink 

circulation unit (19 to 25). A pump (25) of the of 
the ink circulation unit (19 to 25) passes ink from a 

main ink container (19) to a tube (39) and hence to a 
printing head (38) of the apparatus. The ink 

circulation unit (19 to 25) may have a filter (22) for 
filtering the ink before it passes to the printing 

head (38), and also have a secondary ink container 
(20) and a solvent container (21) for containing ink 

and solvent which are passed to the main container 
(19) as they are used up during printing. Access to 

the containers (19 to 25) and the filter (22), which 
need periodic replacement, is via an access cover (8) 

in the casing. The access cover (8) is at the front 
of the casing (1) so that it can be used by an 

operator when the printing apparatus is in its normal 
position. Above the dividing wall (60) is a circuit 

board unit (40,42,43) which controls the ink 
circulation unit (19 to 25), and also the printing 

head (38). The circuit board unit (40,42,43) is also 
close to a display panel (3) of the printing 

apparatus, and is separated from a power unit 
(48,54,57) by a vertical wall (41). Thus, since the  

 
circuit board unit (40,42,43) and the power unit (48, 

54,57) are above the ink circulation unit (19 to 25), 
spillage of ink will not affect them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
printing apparatus. It relates particularly, but not
exclusively, to an ink jet printing apparatus of
continuous type.In a printing apparatus of continuous type, ink
supplied from an apparatus body passes to a printing
head. Particles of ink are jetted from the printing
head in a predetermined pattern, which pattern is
determined by control of the printing head. Such a
printing apparatus of continuous type is used to print
information, such as manufacturing date or sell-by
date, onto product packaging passing the printing
head.At the printing head, ink from the body is jetted
as ink particles from a nozzle past a charging
electrode, which induces a charge on some of the ink
particles. The pattern of charging of the particles
is determined by the information that is to be
printed. The particles then pass a charged deflection
plate which deflects some of the particles (dependent
on the charge thereon) in predetermined directions 
from the printing head, so that they reach the article
to be printed. Other particles, however, pass to a
gutter, which permits them to be returned to the main
body of the printing apparatus.Within that body, there are generally three main
groups of components. The first group form an ink
circulation circuit, for supplying ink to the nozzle
and receiving ink returned from the gutter.
Additional ink may be supplied, as may be solvent,
such that the ink that reaches the nozzle is of
suitable consistency.The ink circulating unit, and possibly the
printing head itself, are controlled by suitable
electronic components. Those electronic components
may be mounted on a circuit board to form a circuit
board unit. The main body will also normally contain
a power unit for supplying power to the other
components, and have a display panel which permits the
operator to control the printing by the printing head.
An example of such a printing apparatus of continuous
type is disclosed in, for example, WO-A-89/03768.
Furthermore, JP-A-5-77439 describes cleaning of the
nozzle of the printing head via a solvent, and JP-A-3-28243
discusses the direction of ink jetted from the
printing head. Moreover, EP-A-271090 discloses an ink jet printing
apparatus in which an ink circulation unit in the form of
a pump is contained within a casing which also contains a
power unit and circuit board driven by the power unit
with circuiting for controlling the pump. The casing
contains a display controlled by the circuit board.The present invention is concerned with the
