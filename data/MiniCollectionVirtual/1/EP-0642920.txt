<ABSTRACT>
A vibration damper includes two materials (a1), each being formed of 
a metal sheet (1) having a rubber- or synthetic resin-base viscoelastic 

polymeric layer (2) or layers formed on one or both sides, which are 
arranged in opposition to each other through said viscoelastic layers 

and bonded together with the use of a hot-melt-adhesive synthetic 
resin layer (3) having a high melting point. Alternatively, one of said 

materials (a1) is arranged in opposition to another metal sheet (4) through 
said vicoelastic layer (2) or layers and bonded thereto with the use of 

said hot-melt-adhesive synthetic resin layer (3). A soundproofing 
structure using such a vibration damer is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with an improvement in or
relating to a composite type of vibration damping material (which may
hereinafter be referred to as the vibration damper) comprising a metal
sheet and a viscoelastic polymeric material and a soundproofing
structure using such a material.US-A-3646158 discloses a constrained layer damped structure comprising an adhering
interlayer comprising a dispersion of precured polyurethane in a copolymer of ethylene with
alpha, beta-unsatd. carboxylic acid, the polyurethane constituting 10-80wt.% of the film.As the composite type of vibration damping materials comprising
a metal sheet and a viscoelastic polymeric material, there have been
known one vibration damper formed of a thin steel sheet 1 and a
rubber- or synthetic resin-base viscoelastic polymeric layer 2 bonded
to both sides thereof, as illustrated in Figure 22, and another
vibration damper formed by sandwiching and bonding a viscoelastic
polymeric layer 2 between two steel sheets 1, as illustrated in Figure
23.The vibration damper of Figure 22 is called the non-constraint
type and can damp vibration due to the "extensional deformation" of
the viscoelastic layer in association with flexural vibration, whereas
the vibration damper of Figure 23 is referred to as the constraint
type and can damp vibration due to the "shearing deformation" of the
viscoelastic layer in association with flexural vibration. From a
comparison of the non-constraint and constraint types of dampers, it
is found that there is a considerable difference therebetween in that 
the constraint type is effective with a thin viscoelastic layer, but
the non-constraint type needs a viscoelastic layer three to four times
as thick as a steel sheet.Said composite type of vibration dampers are used in a wide
range of industrial fields such as automotive engine mounts, disc
brakes, oil pans, transmissions, compressors, air cleaners, brake
clutches, electronic ranges, speakers and players.As mentioned above, the aforesaid composite type of vibration
dampers are now increasingly used in various industrial fields due to
their superior damping capacity. In actual applications, however, they
are often used in severer environments where various factors such as
temperature, pressure, oils, solvents and coolants are applied alone
or in combination, rather than in relatively moderate environments at
normal temperature, under no load and in the atmosphere. There is
thus still demanded a vibration damping material that can sufficiently
meet such

<CLAIMS>
A vibration damping material comprising in
combination:


a first material including a first metal sheet
and a first viscoelastic layer made of rubber- or

synthetic resin base viscoelastic material which is
formed on one side of the first metal sheet;
a second material comprising a second metal
sheet; and
a first hot-melt adhesive synthetic resin layer
having a high melting point which is disposed between

the first viscoelastic layer of the first material and
the second metal sheet so as to serve to bond together

the first and second materials.
A vibration damping material as claimed in claim
1, wherein the second material consists only of a

metal sheet.
A vibration damping material as claimed in claim
1, which further comprises a second viscoelastic layer

made of rubber- or synthetic resin-base viscoelastic
material which is formed on one side of the second

metal sheet and is located adjacent to the first hot-melt
adhesive synthetic resin layer.
A vibration damping material as claimed in claim
3, which further comprises a third metal sheet located

adjacent to the first hot-melt adhesive synthetic
resin layer and a second hot-melt adhesive synthetic

resin layer having a high melting point which is
disposed between the second viscoelastic layer and the

third metal sheet.
