<ABSTRACT>
A rotary mower is disclosed which comprises at least one mowing drum 
(24) depending from a support frame (10, 12), the or each mowing drum 

(24) comprising a cutter member (26) including at least one cutting blade 
(46), the cutter member (26) being arranged to be rotated about its axis 

by a drive shaft (20), a skid plate assembly (58, 60, 62) located below 
and spaced apart from the cutter member (26), in use, and a plurality of 

slide members (28) spaced apart from one another and spaced apart from 
the axis of the cutter member (26), the slide members (28) permitting 

axial movement of the cutter member (26) with respect to the drive shaft 
(20) and transmitting rotational movement of the drive shaft (20) to the 

cutter member (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an agricultural mower of the kind including a 
plurality of rotary mowing drums supported on a frame arranged to be 
propelled by a tractor or the like. In a known mower of the kind specified, the mowing drums are 
supported upon a wheeled frame arranged to be towed behind a tractor 
which also drives the mowing drums. Each of the mowing drums is 
rotatable on said frame and driven by a respective drive shaft. Each 
drum includes at least one mowing blade, and a skid plate located below 
each drum and arranged to contact the ground, in use preventing the or 
each blade from coming into contact with the ground and setting the 
cutting height of the mower. In particular, the present invention relates 
to a mower incorporating a mechanism for adjusting the position of the 
or each blade in order to provide for adjustment of the cutting height. According to the present invention there is provided a rotary mower 
comprising at least one mowing drum depending from a support frame, 
the or each mowing drum comprising a cutter member including at least 
one cutting blade, the cutter member being arranged to be rotated about 
its axis by a drive shaft, a skid plate assembly located below and spaced 
apart from the cutter member, in use, and a plurality of slide members 
spaced apart from one another and spaced apart from the axis of the 
cutter member, the slide members permitting axial movement of the 
cutter member with respect to the drive shaft and transmitting rotational 
movement of the drive shaft to the cutter member.  A drive disc is preferably mounted on the drive shaft so as to be 
rotatable therewith, the slide members being in sliding engagement with 
the drive disc to permit axial movement of the cutter member with 
respect to the drive shaft, whilst transmitting rotary motion from the drive 
shaft to the cutter member. The slide members preferably comprise three equiangularly spaced 
support rods which extend vertically, in use. Each support rod preferably 
extends through a respective aperture provided in the drive disc. A 
bearing bush is preferably provided in each of the apertures. Desirably, a support member is spaced apart from and carried by the 
drive disc, the slide members being in sliding engagement with the 
support member. Conveniently, the cutter member includes an extension arranged to 
engage with the upper end of each slide member. Preferably means for adjusting the axial position of the cutter member 
with respect to the drive shaft is provided. The
