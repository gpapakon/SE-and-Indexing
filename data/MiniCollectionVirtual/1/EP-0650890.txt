<ABSTRACT>
A oscillation suppression device is provided for attenuating 
a oscillation of an object (10) to be controlled by a gyro torque 

of a control moment gyro having a flywheel rotating at a high 
speed. The oscillation suppression device includes an angular 

velocity detector (18) for detecting a oscillation angular 
velocity of the object (10) to be controlled; and control units 

(17; 25, 26; 30; 40; 50) connected to a gimbal shaft (14a) of the 
control moment gyro for controlling the angular velocity (ϑ) of 

the gimbal (14) of the control moment gyro so as to absorb an 
external torque generated in the object to be controlled, in 

response to the oscillation angular velocity (Φ) detected by the 
angular velocity detector (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a oscillation suppression 
device applied to a small ship or a boat such as a leisure boat, 
a suspension type transportation machine such as a gondola, a 
suspension from a helicopter or the like. It also relates to a 
ship provided with the oscillation suppression device. In a conventional oscillation suppression device for 
suppressing a small ship such as a leisure boat, a drum brake or 
a generator is coupled to a gimbal shaft so that an angular 
velocity of the gimbal may be adjusted by the resistance of the 
drum brake or the generator. Fig. 14 shows an arrangement of the conventional oscillation 
suppression device. A flywheel 1 which constitutes the 
oscillation suppression device is connected to a flat type spin 
motor 2 through a spin shaft 9 and is rotated at a high speed 
(with an angular velocity Ω of the flywheel) by the spin motor 2. 
The flywheel 1 is supported by a gimbal 4 through spin system 
bearings 3a and 3b so as not to be prevented from rotating at a 
high speed. The gimbal 4 has the gimbal shaft 4a and rotates about the 
gimbal shaft 4a at an angular velocity . The gimbal shaft 4a is 
supported by support frames 6a and 6b through gimbal system  
 
bearings 5a and 5b so that the gimbal 4 is not prevented from 
rotating. Further, each support frame 6a, 6b is fixed to an 
object 10 to be suppressed in oscillation by the oscillation 
suppression device. The support frames 6a and 6b transmits a gyro 
torque Tψ generated by the rotation of the gimbal 4 to the 
object to be controlled for reducing the oscillation angular 
velocity Φ of the object to be controlled. A drum brake 7 or a generator 8 is connected to one end of 
the gimbal shaft 4a. The angular velocity  of the gimbal is 
controlled by the resistance of the drum brake 7 or the generator 
8. Thus, the gyro torque Tψ is controlled and the oscillation 
angular velocity Φ of the object to be controlled is reduced. 
Namely, in the case of the angular velocity  of the gimbal is 
controlled by the drum brake 7, as shown in Fig. 15, the drum 
brake 7 is provided on the gimbal 4a of a control moment gyro so 
that the angular velocity  of the gimbal 4 is controlled by the 
frictional force of the drum brake 7. In the case where the drum brake 7 is used for controlling 
the angular velocity  of the gimbal 4, the brake torque to be 
applied to the gimbal shaft 4a may be kept constant. For this 
reason, it is impossible to finely control the oscillation 
relative to the oscillation angular velocity
