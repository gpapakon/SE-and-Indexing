<CLAIMS>
Train for the substitution of the rails of railway 
tracks composed of vehicles running on the old and 

the new rails and comprising : 

a welding vehicle (80) provided with a welding unit 
(83) for welding the adjacent ends of the new rails 

(R2) in order to form continuous rail tracks, 
a heating vehicle (1) provided with at least one 
heating device (15a, 15b) for each rail track for 

continuous heating the tracks of new rails (R2) for 
neutralising them during the progressive movement of 

the train and for controlling the temperature of these 
new rails (R2), said welding vehicle (80) and heating 

vehicle (1) running on the old rails, the welding 
vehicle (80) running in front of the heating vehicle 

(1), and 
an assembly vehicle (2) running on the new rails at a 
distance from the heating vehicle (1), said distance 

being at least approximately constant, and comprising 
means for fastening to the sleepers the new rails (R2) 

brought to the desired temperature, 
 
characterized in that 


said substitution train is composed of a welding 
vehicle (80), a heating vehicle (1) and an assembly 

vehicle (2),  
 
the welding vehicle (80) is provided with means (84) 
for positioning the new rails to be welded (R2) which 

were previously transported on the working point 
between the old rails (R1) and is provided further with 

said welding unit (83), which can occupy a working 
position and a rest position in relation to the 

framework of the welding vehicle (80), and with a 
grinding unit (85), said means (84) and units (83, 85) 

being mounted between the leading and the rear bogies 
of said welding vehicle, 
the heating vehicle (1) is provided with at least one 
heating device for each rail track, the heating device 

being composed of a heating tunnel with induction 
heating (15a, 15b) disposed between the old rails (R1) 

and mounted in such a way that the new rails (R2) to be 
heated pass under the axes (5a, 12a) and between the 

wheels of the heating vehicle, said heating vehicle 
comprising further means (14), at the front, for 

gripping the tracks of the new rails (R2) welded and 
positioned between the old rails (R1) to introduce them 

in said tunnels (15a, 15b), retractable platforms (16) 
between the bogies (5, 12), said platforms (16) being 

suspended on the framework (7) of said heating vehicle 
and comprising means (18) for releasing the old rails 

(R1), as well as (29, 31, 32) for gripping and guiding 
said old rails (R1), 
the assembly vehicle (2) comprises at the front a 
cantilevered frame (40) supplied with means for guiding 

and for laying (47, 48) the new rails (R2), and 
retractable platforms (53) between the bogies (42, 61), 

these platforms being suspended on the framework (52) 
of said assembly vehicle and comprising said means for 

fastening the new rails (R2). 
Train according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the tunnel is located in the zone of the rear end 

of the heating vehicle (1) and is preferably divided in 
two parts (15a, 15b) disposed one in front of and the 

other behind the rear bogie (12) of this vehicle. 
Train according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said tunnels (15a, 15b) are mounted in only one 

framework (36). 
Train according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that an auxiliary heating tunnel (15c) 

is installed at the front of the assembly vehicle (2). 
Train according to one of claim 1 to 4, 
characterized in that there is provided a cantilevered 

frame (38) at the rear of the heating vehicle (1), this 
frame carrying an adjustable support (31) provided with 

rail lifters (32) for guiding the old rails (R1). 
Train according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that a tracked conveyor (39) running 
on the sleepers, in order to hinder them from going out 

of the ballast when the old rails (R1) are lifted up, 
is mounted at the rear of the heating vehicle (1). 
Train according to claims 5 and 6, characterized 
in that said tracked conveyor (39) is suspended from 

said cantilevered frame (38). 
Train according to one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that said cantilevered frames (38, 40) 

are displaceable towards the interior of the vehicle 
concerned.  

 
Train according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that said platforms (16, 53) are 

disposed in order to be able to run on the old and the 
new rails. 
Train according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that said platforms (16, 53) are 

provided with robot-machines (18, 54), preferably 
computer-controlled for the automatic detaching and the 

fastening, respectively, of the rail fixtures. 
Train according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that a transport system (73, 74, 75) 

is provided for the conveying of the fixtures, disassembled 
at the working stations of the heating 

vehicle (1), to the fastening stations of the assembly 
vehicle (2). 
Train according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that a station for welding the rails
