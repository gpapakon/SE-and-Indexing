<DESCRIPTION>
 AZACYCLIC COMPOUNDSThis invention relates to a class of azacyclic compounds, which are useful as tachykinin antagonists. More particularly, the compounds of the invention comprise an azacyclic ring system substituted by an arylmethyloxy or arylmethylthio moiety.The tachykinins are a group of naturally- occurring peptides found widely distributed throughout mammalian tissues, both within the central nervous system and in the-peripheral nervous and circulatory systems. The structures of three known mammalian tachykinins are as follows: Substance P:Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH-2 Neurokinin A:His-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 Neurokinin B: Asp-Met-His-Asp-Phe-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2For example, substance P is believed inter alia to be involved in the neurotransmission of pain sensations [Otsuka et al, "Role of Substance P as a Sensory Transmitter in Spinal Cord and Sympathetic Ganglia" in 1982 Substance P in the Nervous System, Ciba Foundation Symposium 91, 13-34 (published by Pitman) and Otsuka and Yanagisawa, "Does Substance P Act as a Pain Transmitter?" TIPS (Dec. 1987) 8.506-510], specifically in the transmission of pain in migraine (B.E.B. Sandberg et al, J. Med Chem, (1982) 25 1009; S.L. Shepheard et al.. Br. J. Pharmacol. (1993), 108. 11-12) and in arthritis [Levine et al in Science (1984) 226 547-549]. These peptides have also been implicated in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and diseases of the GI 

tract such as inflammatory bowel disease [Mantyh et al in Neuroscience (1988) 25. (3) 817-37 and D. Regoli in"Trends in Cluster Headache" Ed. Sicuteri et al Elsevier Scientific Publishers, Amsterdam (1987) page 85)]. It is also hypothesised that there is a neurogenic mechanism for arthritis in which substance P may play a role [Kidd et al "A Neurogenic Mechanism for Symmetrical Arthritis" in The Lancet, 11 November 1989 and Grδnblad et al "Neuropeptides in Synovium of Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis" in J. Rheumatol. (1988)15(12) 1807-10]. Therefore, substance P is believed to be involved in the inflammatory response in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [0'Byrne et al in Arthritis and Rheumatism (1990) 3J3 1023-8]. Other disease areas where tachykinin antagonists are believed to be useful are allergic conditions [Hamelet et al Can. J. Pharmacol. Physiol. (1988) 66 1361-7], immunoregulation [Lotz et al Science (1988) 2411218-21 and Ki ball et al, J. Immunol. (1988) 141 (10) 3564-9] vasodilation, bronchospasm, reflex or neuronal
