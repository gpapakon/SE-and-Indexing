<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of (alpha),w dicarboxylic acids of formula (I) in which X and Y, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, carboxyl, C1-C6-alkoxycarbonyl or carbamoyl, R1 and R2, which may the same or different, are hydrogen or C1-C6-alkyl, and Q is a linear saturated or unsaturated alkylene chain with 2-14 C atoms in which one or more C atoms may be replaced by cyclohexyl rings, phenyl or heterocycles, and their (in vivo) hydrolysable carboxylic acid derivatives for the production of medicaments with a fibrinogen reducing effect.
