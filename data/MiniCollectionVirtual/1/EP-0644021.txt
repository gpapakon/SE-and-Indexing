<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for opening slits (24a,24b,24c) of uneven lengths in 
the concentric circular shaving sections of an external cutting member (12) 

that is used in an electric razor using a rotary cutter (56) that cuts the 
shaving sections of the external cutting member (12) in radial directions 

as the external cutting member (12) is rotated around its axis by a 
predetermined angle with a use of an index device (52b). The differences in 

the length of the slit (24a,24b,24c) are obtained by changing the cutting 
angle of the rotary cutter (56) relative to the external cutting member (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for making an external cutting member of an electric 
razor and more particularly to a method and apparatus for opening 
slits in the external cutting member of an electric razor. Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokoku) 
No. 41-14339 discloses an external cutting member for an electric 
razor that has two concentric circular shaving sections. The external cutting member of this prior art has 
a partition groove that divides the shaving surface into inner 
and outer circular shaving sections. The partition groove is an 
angled-U-shape in cross section. The two shaving sections 
obtained by the partition groove are formed with many slits which 
open in a radial direction. Since the partition groove that divides the 
shaving surface has sharp edges, pieces of hair and grease from 
the skin tend to accumulate in the partition groove, thus making 
it insanitary. In addition, the process for making the 
angled-U-shaped groove is troublesome. Furthermore, the hair that enters into the 
partition groove may be bent when it comes into contact with the  
 
bottom of the groove. As a result, a smooth shaving is often 
hindered. On the other hand, while the external cutting 
member as described above may be made by pressing, it is 
difficult to form the slits with high precision. Accordingly, the present invention seeks to provide 
a method of making an external cutting member and more 
particularly to provide a method of opening slits in the 
external member, the slits being able to smoothly bring 
the hair thereinto. The present invention also seeks to provide an 
apparatus for opening slits in an external cutting 
member that produces slits which can smoothly bring the 
hair thereinto. It is proposed to accomplish this by a unique 
method of opening slits in an external cutting member 
for an electric razor that takes the steps of: 
(i) Bringing a rotary cutter into contact with a 
round shaving surface of an external cutting member, which has 
plural concentric sections divided by one or more concentric 
circular partition grooves, so as to open rectilinear first slits 
in a radial direction, the first slits crossing all the shaving 
sections and partition grooves; and (ii) Bringing the rotary cutter so as to come into 
contact with the shaving section(s) up to the innermost partition 
groove or up to the partition groove that is outside the  
 
innermost partition groove, thus opening the uneven length second 
and third slits between the first

A method for opening slits in an external cutting 
member, which is for an electric razor and has three concentric 

circular shaving sections on its round top which are divided by 
inner and outer concentric circular partition grooves, comprising 

the steps of: 
   cutting said three concentric circular shaving 

sections and said two partition grooves in a radial direction of 
said external cutting member with a rotary cutter for opening a 

first slit, then rotating said external cutting member for a 
predetermined angle about an axis of said external cutting 

member, and cutting first slits circumferentially on said top 
surface of said external cutting member; 

   cutting said two outer circular shaving sections 
and an outer partition groove in a radial direction of said 

external cutting member with said rotary cutter for opening a 
second slit between two of said first slits, then rotating said 

external cutting member for a predetermined angle about an axis 
of said external cutting member and cutting second slits 

circumferentially on said top surface of said external cutting 
member; and 

   cutting an outermost concentric circular shaving 
section in a radial direction of said external cutting member 

with a rotary cutter for opening a third slit at a position 
between said first slit and said second slit, then rotating said 

external cutting member for a predetermined angle about an axis 
of said external cutting member, and cutting third slits 

 
circumferentially on said top surface of said external cutting 

member. 
A method for opening slits in an external cutting 
member, which is for an electric razor and has a plurality of 

concentric circular shaving sections on its round top surface 
which are divided by concentric circular partition grooves, 

comprising the steps of: 
   opening a first slit by cutting said concentric 

circular shaving sections and said partition grooves in a radial 
direction of said external cutting member by a rotary cutter; 

   rotating said external cutting member for a 
predetermined angle about an axis of said external cutting 

member, 
   opening another first slit, and repeating said 

steps of opening first slits circumferentially on said top 
surface of said external cutting member; 

   opening a second slit between two of said first 
slits by cutting less number of said circular shaving sections 

and outer partition grooves than in said first slits in a radial 
direction of said external cutting member by said rotary cutter; 

   rotating said external cutting member for a 
predetermined angle about an axis of said external cutting 

member, 
   opening another second slit, and repeating said 

steps of opening second slits circumferentially on said top 
surface of said external cutting member; 

   opening a third slit between one of said first 
slits and one of said second slits by cutting less number of 

 
circular shaving sections than in said second slits in a radial 

direction of said external cutting member by said rotary cutter; 
   rotating said external cutting member for a 

predetermined angle about an axis of said external cutting 
member; and 

   opening another third slit, and repeating said

rotary cutter to make an adjustment of a vertical positional 
relationship between said rotary cutter and said external cutting 

member held by said chuck; and
 

   a motor provided on said reciprocation mover for
