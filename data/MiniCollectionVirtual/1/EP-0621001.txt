<ABSTRACT>
A yolk cup (17) is provided for use in an egg breaking 
apparatus. The yolk cup (17) is pivotable between a 

substantially horizontal position and an inclined position. In 
the horizontal position, the yolk cup (17) receives an egg 

content including a yolk and an albumen, the yolk cup (17) 
being provided with discharge means (29, 32) for selectively 

discharging the albumen while retaining the yolk when the yolk 
cup (17) is held in the horizontal position. The discharge 

means (29, 32) comprises a yolk discharge opening (29) 
elongated horizontally for discharging the yolk when the yolk 

cup (29) is pivoted to the inclined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a yolk cup which can be 
advantageously incorporated in an automatic egg breaking 
apparatus. More specifically, the present invention relates to 
a yolk cup of the type which receives the content of an 
automatically broken egg and separately discharges the yolk and 
albumen of the egg content. As is well known, eggs have found wide use. For 
example, the egg yolk may be used as a material for making 
mayonnaise or other food products. The egg white (albumen) may 
be used for making pharmaceutical products or as a binder for 
protein products. Due to such wide use of the egg, it is 
absolutely necessary in industry to use an automatic egg 
breaking apparatus for breaking eggs and taking out their 
contents at high speed. Further, since the two different parts 
of the egg content have different applications, it is also 
necessary to automatically separate the yolk and albumen. U.S. Patent No. 4,111,111 to Willsey discloses a cup 
assembly used in an automatic egg breaker for separating the 
content of an automatically broken egg. More specifically, the 
cup assembly comprises an upper yolk cup (separating cup) and a 
lower albumen cup. The yolk cup has a V-shaped groove at a 
front portion of the yolk cup, and a separate slot at a rear 
portion of the yolk cup. When the yolk cup receives the egg 
content, the egg albumen is discharged gravitionally through 
the V-shaped groove and through the slot for falling into the 
lower albumen cup while retaining the egg yolk. Further, the  
 
yolk cup is pivotable to assume a laterally inclined position 
for discharging the egg yolk over the top brim of the yolk cup. According to the prior art arrangement described above, 
the V-shaped groove is used only for selectively discharging 
the egg albumen, and the egg yolk is discharged over the top 
brim of the yolk cup by laterally pivoting the yolk cup. Thus, 
it is necessary to later pivot the albumen cup forwardly 
downward for discharging the albumen from the albumen cup. In 
other words, the egg yolk and the egg albumen must be 
discharged from the respective cups by two different pivotal 
movements with a time difference. As a result, the efficiency 
of the automatic egg breaker as a whole becomes relatively low. While it is conceivable to use the V-shaped groove also 
for discharging the egg yolk by pivoting the yolk cup forwardly 
downward without prior lateral pivoting. In this case, 
however, the yolk sac is likely to be damaged by coming into 
rubbing contact with the edges of the

<CLAIMS>
A yolk cup (17, 17') for an egg breaking apparatus, the yolk 
cup (17, 17') being pivotable between a substantially 

horizontal position and an inclined position, the yolk cup (17, 
17') in the horizontal position receiving an egg content 

including a yolk and an albumen, the yolk cup (17, 17') being 
provided with discharge means (29, 29', 32, 32') for 

selectively discharging the albumen while retaining the yolk 
when the yolk cup (17, 17') is held in the horizontal position, 

   wherein the discharge means (29, 29', 32, 32') comprises 

a yolk discharge opening (29, 29') elongated horizontally for 
discharging the yolk when the yolk cup is pivoted to the 

inclined position. 
The yolk cup according to claim 1, wherein the yolk 
discharge opening (29, 29') is generally ellipsoidal and 

located at a front portion of the yolk cup (17, 17'), the yolk 
cup (17, 17') being forwardly tiltable. 
The yolk cup according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
discharge means (29, 32) further comprises a plurality of 

albumen discharge openings (32) formed under the yolk discharge 
opening (32) separately therefrom. 
The yolk cup according to claim 3, wherein the yolk 
discharge opening (29) has a lower margin (31) which is bent 

outwardly to provide a rounded guide for smoothly discharging 
the yolk. 
The yolk cup according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
discharge means (29' 32') further comprises a generally 

U-shaped albumen discharge opening (32') formed under the yolk 
discharge opening (29') continuously therewith, the U-shaped 

albumen discharge opening (32') having rounded corner portions 
for transition to the yolk discharge opening (29'). 
The yolk cup according to claim 5, wherein the yolk 
discharge opening (29') and the albumen discharge opening (32') 

have a combined margin (31') which is bent outwardly to 
provided a rounded guide for smoothly discharging the yolk. 
The yolk cup according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein 
the yolk cup (17, 17') has an upper brim (25, 25') which is 

bent outwardly to provided a rounded inner corner.
