<ABSTRACT>
Walls comprising plastic panels or shells, on many occasions, must not be damaged by fastening devices which are intended for fastening objects or devices on said walls. In order to prevent a fastening device from penetrating the walls (1) or shells, the latter are provided integrally with blind-hole-like recesses (4), of which each is of an elliptical cross-section (6) at least in the region of its base. Bolts (8) may be introduced into the recesses (4), said bolts having approximately complementary, elliptical widenings in the region of their inner ends (12), with the result that each bolt (8) can be anchored in the recesses (4) by rotating through approximately 90 DEG .

Fastening arrangement for securing objects or devices to walls (1) consisting of 
plates or shells made of synthetic material, preferably to the inner walls (1) of 

refrigerators or freezers, said inner walls consisting of plastic plates being provided 
with plastic foam at the rear side, said fastening arrangement comprising 

a pin (8) and a wall (1) which is integrally provided with a bottom hole-like 
recess (4) holding the pin (8),
 
characterized in
 
that the recess (4) has an elliptical cross-section (6) in the area of its bottom 

and that the pin (8) which is insertable into the recess (4) has an approximately 
complementary elliptical widening (12) in the section of its inner end so that the 

pin (8) can be fastened in the recess (4) by a rotation through approximately 
90Â°. 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that the recess 
has a cylindrical section in its outer region with which a complementary cylindrical 

section of the pin comes into engagement. 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the pin 
has a tapered cylindrical shank portion between its outer cylindrical section and 

its approximately elliptical end part. 
Fastening arrangement according to claim 3, characterized in that the elliptical 
section of the pin is diminished towards its end in a tapered form.
