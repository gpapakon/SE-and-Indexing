<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly (2) is shown 
including a receptacle housing (4) and a wire gripping 

assembly (6) is comprised of identical halves (40) which 
sandwich between them a multi-conductor cable (12). The 

cable gripping members (40) have latching detents (48) 
which correspond with apertures (36) in a preloaded 

condition, but with apertures (38) in a fully loaded 
condition, whereby when in the fully loaded condition, the 

free ends of the individual conductors (10) project 
through apertures in the end face (22) of the receptacle 

member to be aligned with through holes in the printed 
circuit boards (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to an electrical 
connector for interconnecting the electrical conductors 
of, for example a multi-conductor insulated cable, to 
another component, such as a printed circuit board. Many times it is necessary to electrically 
interconnect the individual conductors of a multi-conductor 
cable to a printed circuit board, for example in 
electronic units such as televisions, electronic printers, 
and the like. Many proposals have been made for such 
interconnections, for example see European Patent 
Application 0 385 314, where an electrical connector is 
permanently mounted to a printed circuit board where a 
wire can be inserted into the connector for 
interconnection with terminals within the electrical 
connector. Many times however it is necessary to 
permanently interconnect the conductors of the multi-conductor 
cable directly to the printed circuit board, and 
the present invention addresses that need. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide 
an electrical connector to permanently interconnect 
electrical conductors of an multi-conductor cable, for 
example, to another component, such as a printed circuit 
board. The objects of the invention have been accomplished 
by providing an electrical connector for mounting 
electrical conductors to a printed circuit board, 
comprising a housing member mountable to the printed 
circuit board, the connector being characterized by a 
gripping member for gripping the conductors and being 
cooperable with said housing member for aligning free ends 
of the wire with the printed circuit board. It is an advantage of this invention that the 
conductors may be easily mounted to another component. It  
 
is another advantage of this invention that the conductor 
ends are protected. It is yet another advantage of this 
invention that reliable strain relief is provided for the 
conductor. It is a further advantage of this invention 
that by proper configuration of the electrical connector 
keying and locking features may be included. The invention will now be described by way of 
reference to the drawing figures where; 
Figure 1 is an isometric view of the electrical 
connector of the present invention in a partially 
assembled manner; Figure 2 is an isometric view similar to that of 
Figure 1, however in a fully assembled position, and where 
the end of the receptacle connector is partially broken 
away; Figure 3 is a plan view of the receptacle connector 
shown in Figure 1; Figure 4 is an end view of the receptacle connector
