<ABSTRACT>
A heat distributing device (1) which includes a concentrated heat source (2, 2a) and a stack (3) of metal foils (4, 5) wherein the heat source is encapsulated between two of the layers of metal foil. The heat source can be a resistance heated wire which extends linearly and has a free end spaced inwardly from an end of the stack. The outer edge of the stack can be open (6) or sealed (7). The stack can include metal wool (8) and/or insulating material (9) between layers of the metal foil. The heat distributing device can be used to provide uniform heating across an outermost layer of the metal foil. For instance, the heat distributing device can be used to heat a side-view mirror (11) of an automobile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heat distributing devices
and, more particularly, to heat distributing devices which can provide a
uniform distribution of heat over a large area from a concentrated heat
source.Heat distributing devices such as heating pads are known in
the art. Such devices include a heating element such as a resistance
heated wire which extends in a pattern over the entire heating pad
surface. Such devices are costly due to the amount of resistance heating
wire required and due to the complexity of manufacture thereof.Also known in the art is an electrically conductive polymer
made by Raychem Corporation, located in Menlo Park, California. Such
conductive polymer material has been used for heating exterior side-view
mirrors of automotive vehicles.GB-A-2 204 220 discloses an electric heater, wherein a network of resistance
wires in laid uniformly within a stack of metal sheets. DE-A-2 627 555
discloses an electric heater for gaseous media; the heating body is covered
by a three-dimensional network of thermal-conductive and heat-resistant material.There is a need in the art for a heat distributing device
which is simple to manufacture and which consists of low-cost materials.These objects are achieved with the features of the claims.The invention provides a heat distributing device which
includes a heat source encapsulated in a stack of layers of metal foil. The 
heat source can be a concentrated heat source, and the stack can have a
relatively large surface area. The layers of foil are arranged one above
another with the heat source between two of the layers. The layers of the
metal foil can be spaced apart by one or more open spaces therebetween.
For instance, the stack can include at least three non-perforated layers of
the metal foil, each of the layers including a plurality of embossments so
as to provide air gaps between the layers.According to one embodiment of the invention, the heat
source comprises an electrical resistance heating element embedded in the
stack such that a plurality of layers of the metal foil are located on one or
both sides of the electrical resistance heating element. One or more of
the layers of metal foil can include a plurality of embossments therein
separating the layers. For instance, the stack can include ten layers with
five embossed layers of aluminum foil on each side of the heating
element.The layers of metal foil can be of aluminum, an aluminum
alloy, stainless steel or another suitable metal having a thickness which
allows the stack to be
