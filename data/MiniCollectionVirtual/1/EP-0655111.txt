<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elastic anti-impact and anti-vibration 
metal cable device for supporting a rotary unit. 
The term "rotary unit" signifies a unit forming part of a 
household electrical appliance or the like, such as a tub plus 
drum of a washing machine, dishwasher or the like, to which the 
relative electric motor is connected for rotation, this also being 
in a suspended state. In this type of known household electrical appliance the rotary 
unit, or the drum tub, is suspended on four springs and is 
retained on the appliance base by two or more stabilizer elements, 
for example of piston type. In a washing machine for example, during the rotation of the drum 
contained in the tub the stabilizer elements brake the 
oscillations generated not only by the rotary movement of the drum 
but also, and in particular, by the vibrations determined by the 
variations undergone by the weight contained in the drum. It must also be considered that in such an appliance the passage 
from the wash stage to the spinning stage is particularly 
critical. This is because a very slow rotation state passes to a  
 
very fast rotation state with consequent creation of large-amplitude 
vibrations, with considerable jolting. This situation 
is also due to the fact that the masses are not distributed 
uniformly immediately and indeed can remain eccentric, in 
particular with a drum having a low weight of about 500-700 g when 
unloaded. These vibrations are currently reduced to a large extent by 
positioning inertial blocks of various materials such as concrete, 
cement, cast iron etc. on top of and to the side of the tub. 
These blocks usually weigh about 20-25 kg to increase the 
stability of the unit formed by the tub, motor and drum, so 
eliminating or at least limiting the amplitude of the vibrations 
along the three cartesian axes. The stresses induced in the rotary unit vary because of the 
eccentricity of the weights treated in the unit and also on the 
basis of the drum speed which, during the spinning stage, can 
reach 500-1200 rpm according to the type of washing machine. 
It should also be noted that for such a type of household 
electrical appliance provided with a rotary unit the critical 
speed is about 450-500 rpm with an internal weight of about 600 g. 
This occurs during passage from a low speed such as the wash speed 
to a high speed such as the spinning speed, as the masses present 
in the drum are not well distributed. In an attempt to solve this problem, some types of washing machine 
have
