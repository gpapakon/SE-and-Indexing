<ABSTRACT>
An assembly is disclosed for supplying compressed air 
to both an engine (12) and an air suspension (14) of a motor 

vehicle. The assembly comprises a direct current electric 
motor (18), a centrifugal air pump (20), and a piston 

pump (22). The motor (18) has a shaft (24) extending 
outwardly from opposite sides of the motor, with the 

centrifugal pump (20) being driven by one end of the shaft 
and the piston pump (22) being driven by the other end of 

the shaft (24). The centrifugal pump (20) produces high 
volumes of air at low pressure required by the engine (12), 

while the piston pump (22) produces low volumes of air at 
high pressure required by the air suspension (14). Bypass 

valves (34,38) are provided to selectively divert the air 
provided by the pumps (20,22) to the atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air suspension compressors 
and engine air pumps for motor vehicles and, more 
particularly, to an air suspension compressor and an engine 
air pump that are driven by a common direct current electric 
motor. Pneumatic suspension systems of motor vehicles 
typically require air or gas to be supplied to inflatable or 
bellows-type springs at relatively high pressures, but at 
relatively low volume. A specialized pump or compressor is 
normally provided to produce an air flow with these 
characteristics, and the air suspension compressor is 
generally powered by means such as a direct current 
electrical motor dedicated to this purpose. For example, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,738,454 to Watanabe, assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated by 
reference, discloses an air suspension system having an air 
compressor which may be mounted under the floor of the 
vehicle. Conversely, the engine of the motor vehicle may require 
air at relatively low pressure and high volume for engine 
emission applications, particularly when excess air is 
needed during engine start-up conditions. Therefore, a 
compressor having operating characteristics different than 
those of the air suspension compressor, as well as its own 
power source, is conventionally required to supply engine 
air. The present invention is an integral assembly for 
supplying compressed air to both an engine and an air 
suspension of a motor vehicle. The assembly comprises a 
direct current electric motor having a shaft extending 
outwardly from opposite sides of the motor, a centrifugal 
air pump, and a piston pump. The centrifugal air pump is 
driven by one end of the shaft, and produces high volumes of 
air at low pressure required by the engine. The piston pump 
is driven by the other end of the shaft, and produces low  
 
volumes of air at high pressure required by the air 
suspension. A suspension control module is provided in 
communication with the direct current electric motor and 
with each of two bypass valves. The first bypass valve is 
disposed in a line between the centrifugal air pump and the 
engine, and is in selective communication with the 
atmosphere. The second bypass valve is disposed in a line 
between the piston pump and the air suspension, and is also 
in selective communication with the atmosphere. The 
suspension control module can either selectively disable the 
direct current electric motor, open the first bypass valve 
to divert the air provided by the centrifugal air pump
