<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic, hygiene or dermopharmaceutical composition, characterised by the fact that it comprises, in combination, at least one superoxide dismutase and at least one melanin pigment. In such a composition, the melanin pigment synergistically enhances the anti-free radical action of SOD. Application especially to combating cellular ageing and to the protection of the skin, the hair and the mucous membranes against the harmful and inaesthetic effects caused by the free radicals.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic, hygienic or dermopharmaceutical
composition, characterized in that it comprises, in

combination, at least one superoxide dismutase and at
least one melanin pigment, the said melanin pigment being

present in a proportion of 0.001 to 1% by weight.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the said superoxide dismutase is chosen from

natural enzymes capable of catalysing the reaction of
disproportionation of the superoxide ions, and any

equivalent product which has such an activity.
Composition according to either of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said melanin pigment is

chosen from:

the products of oxidation of at least one
indole or indoline compound;
the products of polymerization of melanin
precursors;
the products resulting from the extraction of
natural substances containing melanin;
and melanin pigments obtained by culturing
microorganisms.
Composition according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the said indole compound

corresponds to the formula: 


in which:

R
1
 and R
3
 denote, independently of each other,
a hydrogen atom or a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl group;
R
2
 denotes a hydrogen atom, a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl group,
a carboxyl group or an alkoxy(C
1
-C
4
)carbonyl group;
each of the substituents R
4
 to R
7
 independently
denotes a hydrogen atom, a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl group, an -NHR° or
-OZ group, R° denoting a hydrogen atom, a C
2
-C
4
 acyl group

-C
4
 hydroxyalkyl group, and Z denoting a hydrogen
atom, a C
2
-C
14
 acyl group, a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl group or a trimethylsilyl
group,
and R
5
 may additionally denote a halogen atom,
it being understood that:
at least one of the substituents R
4
 to R
7

denotes an OZ or NHR° group, not more than one of the
substituents R
4
 to R
7
 denoting NHR° and not more than two
of the substituents R
4
 to R
7
 denoting OZ and, in this
latter case, when Z denotes a hydrogen atom, the two

substituents denoting OH are R
5
 and R
6
,
and at least one of the substituents R
4
 to R
7

denotes a hydrogen atom and, in the case where only one
of these substituents denotes a hydrogen atom, only one

of the substituents R
4
 to R
7
 then denotes NHR° or OZ, and
the other substituents R
4
 to R
7
 then denote a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl
group or else, where applicable, in the case of R
5
, a
halogen atom;

   and the esters or the salts of these compounds.
Composition according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the said melanin pigment is

obtained by oxidation of 5,6-dihydroxyindole.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the said indoline compound

corresponds to the formula:


in which:

R
10

a hydrogen atom or a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl radical,
R
9

1
-C
4
 alkyl
radical or a carboxyl or alkoxy(C

 alkyl
radical, hydroxyl, alkoxy (C
1
-C
4

or halogen,
R
11
 denotes a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group,

   on condition that at least one of the radicals R
11
