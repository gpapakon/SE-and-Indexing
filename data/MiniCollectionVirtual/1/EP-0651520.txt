<ABSTRACT>
In a frequency modulated digital radio transmission system, frequency 
differences between transmitter and receiver which give rise to DC offsets at the output 

of the demodulator are countered for any one data transmission by establishing a 
frequency controlling or DC level controlling signal during a preamble sequence having 

a known constant DC component, such as the sequence 10101 ------- used for clock or 
data synchronisation, and retaining that controlling signal substantially unaltered for use 

during the remainder of that data transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
A problem arises in digital FM radio receivers in that demodulated data may be
superimposed on a DC level which is dependent on frequency differences between
oscillators in the transmitter and receiver. The DC level will also be subject to drift with
time and temperature. When a comparator is used to slice the demodulated data signal,
which is usually almost sinusoidal for the highest frequency data pattern, considerable
pulse stretching will occur as the slicing point on the data moves with DC level. AC
coupling can be used with DC restoration but is always less than perfect and introduces
a degree of timing jitter on the recovered data, particularly when the demodulated data
contains amplitude variations which may be introduced as the data rate approaches the
maximum obtainable from the channel bandwidth.In a radio system where a number of transmitters and receivers communicate
together on a network using frequency hopping, rapid switches in channel frequency and
from transmit to receive are required. A conventional AFC system would be difficult
to use in these circumstances as considerable time would be lost waiting for the system
to recover after each frequency step or switch to receive function. Any AFC system
used with digital modulation cannot respond to the average DC output level as this
varies with data content and would produce a variable slicing level. Peak sensing of the
data out could be used but this is also subject to variation as the channel limits are
approached, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.DC control arrangements are known e.g. from US-A-4 544 894.According to the present invention in a receiver arrangement for a frequency
modulated digital data radio transmission system in which each data transmission
commences with a predetermined sequence of digital values, there are provided control 
means comprising means to derive a correction factor for DC offsets pertaining at the
output of a demodulator of the receiver arrangement during a said predetermined
sequence and means to retain said correction factor substantially unaltered during the
remainder of the respective data transmission.The correction factor may be applied to control the tuning of the demodulator
of the receiver arrangement or may be applied to circuit means arranged to counter said
DC offsets. Said circuit means may comprise a level shift circuit. The means to derive
the correction factor may comprise a protocol controller in the receiver arrangement.In a system in which all transmitters and receivers are
