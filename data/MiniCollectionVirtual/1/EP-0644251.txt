<ABSTRACT>
In an ebullated bed process reactor, effluent is 
subjected to high pressure flash separation followed by 

intermediate flash separation. An ebullation liquid is 
formed by educting high pressure flash separation liquid 

into an intermediate flash separation liquid. The 
ebullation liquid is recycled to the reactor to expand the 

catalyst bed to 110 vol% to 200 vol% of a settled catalyst 
bed volume. As a result of this recycling, pressure 

balance is advantageously maintained, and carry-over 
catalyst and catalyst fines are recycled to the reactor 

and kept out of downstream equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ebullated bed process for
the liquid phase hydroprocessing of a hydrocarbon feedstock. The
invention also relates to a recycle system with a liquid/liquid
eductor for ebullating a catalyst bed.The ebullated bed process comprises the passing of
concurrently flowing streams of liquids or slurries of liquids
and solids and gas upwardly through a vertically elongated
cylindrical vessel containing a catalyst bed. The catalyst in
the bed is maintained in random motion in the liquid and has a
gross volume dispersed through the liquid greater than the volume
of the catalyst when stationary. This technology has been used
commercially in the upgrading of heavy liquid hydrocarbons or
converting coal to synthetic oils.The process is generally described in U. S. Re 25,770
to Johanson. A mixture of
hydrocarbon liquid and hydrogen is passed upwardly through a bed
of catalyst particles at a rate such that the particles are
forced into random motion as the liquid and gas flow upwardly
through the bed. The random catalyst motion is controlled by 
recycle liquid flow so that at steady state, the bulk of the
catalyst does not rise above a definable level in the reactor.
Vapors along with the liquid which is being hydrogenated are
removed at the upper portion of the reactor.In an ebullated bed process the substantial amounts of
hydrogen gas and light hydrocarbon vapors rise through the
reaction zone into the catalyst free zone. Liquid from the
catalyst free zone is both recycled to the bottom of the reactor
to ebullate the catalyst bed and removed from the reactor as
product. Vapor is separated from the liquid recycle stream
before being passed through the recycle conduit to the recycle
pump suction. The recycle pump (ebullation pump) maintains the
expansion (ebullation) and random motion of catalyst particles at
a constant and stable level by recycling liquid to the bottom of
the reactor. The recycle pump for this service has a high
suction pressure but a head of only 7x104-7x105Pa (10 to 100 psi), typically
3.4x105Pa (50 psi). Such pumps are commercially available and command a
premium price. Because of the high suction pressure service, the
support facilities for these pumps, e.g., high pressure seal oil
system and variable speed drive system require frequent and
expensive maintenance.Reactors employed in a catalytic hydrogenation process
with an ebullated bed of catalyst particles are designed with a
central vertical recycle conduit which serves as the downcomer 
for recycling liquid from the
