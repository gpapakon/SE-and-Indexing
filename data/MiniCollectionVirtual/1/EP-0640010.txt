<ABSTRACT>
A passive filter for taking up gaseous substances, preferably gaseous smelling substances, from a space, including a porous sorbating, self regenerating material composition, including two material components (A, B), of which a first material component (A) consists of one or more porous materials such as perlite, zeolite, bentonite, silicon dioxide ground to powder or christobalite, and a second material component (B) consists of one or more materials with the capability to take up water molecules directly from the surrounding air, such as silicon dioxide gel, starch or derivatives of cellulose, gypsom, silicates of alkali, aluminium silicate, or fuller's earth. The material components (A, B) are kept joined into a lattice by means of a binder, at which the first material component (A) join with 50 - 95 %, preferably 80 - 90 % (percentage of weight), and the second material component (B) with 5 - 50 %, preferably 10 - 20 % (percentage of weight), in the material composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a passive filter
including a self-regenerating composition of materials
which has a capability to take up and keep gaseous, particularly
smelling substances from the surrounding air
and after that slowly emit these substances and/or their
rest products destructed by oxidation or reduction. Below
the invention is described based on gaseous, smelling
substances, which not excludes its application on gaseous
substances generally wether these substances emit odour
or not.By the Swedish patent publication SE-C-387 681
it is known to prevent or reduce the apperance of condensate
on a surface by coating the surface with a layer of
a composition of materials including granules with heat-insulating
and sorbating properties. By chance it was
observed that the known coating also has a certain capability
to remove odour from the air to which it is in
contact by acting as a passive filter. However continued
experiments showed a weakness in the smell removing properties
of the known coating, namely that it was quickly
saturated, at which its capability to take up odour is
ceased and the coating in it self started smelling.Since long it is known that porous materials
have a capability to take up odour. Porous materials are
used as filters in ventilation equipments by which the
smelling substances are sorbated when air, polluted by
smelling substances, is forced through the filters by
means of a mechanical ventilation. This use is known from
a great number of patent publications as e.g. SE-C-218
164, DE-A-2 129 795, DE-A-1 619 586 and US-A-4 604 110.A special case is described in the patent 
publications DE-A-3 735 222 and DE-A-3 801 652. The purpose
with the device described is to put a chemical sorbating
layer combined whith a diffusion-tight layer as a
shielding between the contaminated building structure and
rooms for to live.Porous materials also are used to suck smelling
substances in a liquid phase or solved in a liquid e.g.
to serve as a so-called cat litter or a sorbating material
for sanitation works. The patent publications
WO 82/04408 and GB-A-1 593 058 describe such materials.Porous materials also are used in combination
with hygroscopic additives for taking up moisture in
packings and spaces for apparatuses. Such a material is
known from the patent publication DE-B-1 260 441. A composition for eliminating organic odours
comprising a crystalline siliceous zeolite and an aluminosilicate
is known from the European patent publication
EP-A-0 297 543. This composition may be used
