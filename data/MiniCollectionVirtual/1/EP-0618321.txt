<ABSTRACT>
Machine for automatically sewing two stockings together to form a pair of tights (pantihose) comprising several twinned flat forms (1) for supporting each pair of stockings to be joined, means for positioning and moving the stockings over the respective forms, with means for longitudinally cutting the said bodies, in which machine the said forms (1) are supported individually by corresponding form-bearing pallets (2) so as to allow them to be driven separately and at different speeds, in which machine an automatic sewing machine (3) is provided, stationary, in register with the station (S) for sewing the stockings, so as to make the single seam, that is to say without discontinuity, of the aligned edges of the bodies thus cut, and in which machine means are provided for driving each pallet (2) in register with the sewing station (S) at a differentiated speed with respect to all the others.

Method for the automatic sewing of two stockings
forming a panty hose, comprising the steps of:


a) fitting and positioning the two stockings on
corresponding paired shapes;
b) carrying out the longitudinal cut of an equal
length of the bodices of the thus positioned

stockings;
c) spreading apart the shapes with the thus cut
stockings bodices thereon;
d) carrying out the the seaming of the fabric edges
projecting from the thus spread apart shaps;

characterized by the fact that the shapes not
interested by the seaming are movable separately

and at different speeds so as to allow their stop
for the corresponding steps, separately and that

during the seaming step the carrying speed is
constant and the same for all the shapes, but

differentiated with respect to that of the shapes
not interested by the seaming.
Apparatus for the automatic sewing of two
stockings forming a panty hose in accordance with

the method of claim 1, comprising a plurality of
shapes (1) paired for supporting each pair of

stockings to be joined, positioning means for 
positioning and moving the stockings onto the

respective shapes, cutting means for longitudinally
cut
 the bodices, characterized by the fact that
said shapes (1) are individually carried by

corresponding shape-holder pallets (2) so as to
allow them to be separately moved at different

speeds, that it comprises an automatic stationary
seamer (3) in correspondence with the stockingsseaming

station (S), so as to carry out in one time
an uninterrupted seaming of the fabric edges of

the thus cut bodices, and that it comprises means
for moving each pallet (2) at a differentiated

speed in correspondence of the sewing station (S)
with respect to all the others.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 2,
characterized by the fact that said means for

moving the pallets (2) comprises a sector gear (4)
in correspondence of the base of each pallet (2),

said sector gear (4) is shaped as a circular arc,
with the concavity turned inwardly of the

apparatus, and is engaged with a corresponding
pinion (5): said pinions (5) being disposed at the

vertexes of a regular hexagon inside the apparatus
and the distance between two adjacent pinions (5)

being approximately equal to the chord of said 
circular arc, so as to allow the pallets (2) to be

moved whatever their angular position.
Apparatus in accordance with claims 2 and 3,
characterized by the fact that each pinion (5) is

engaged to a corresponding driving motor so that
the pinion (5) of the seaming station and the one

adjacent thereto in the direction of rotation of
the carrousel, rotate at different speed with

respect to all other pinions (5).
Apparatus in accordance with claims 2 ad 3,
characterized by the fact that the angular

amplitude of each sector (4) is a fraction of the
round angle, so that a same fraction (X) will be

free or empty, that is not engaged by any sector
(4).
Apparatus in accordance with claim 2,
characterized by the fact that said means for

moving the pallets (2) comprises two closed loop
chain drives (6, 7), wherein one (6) is engaged

with a corresponding driving motor (60) and
intended to move the pinion (5) in correspondence

of the seaming station (S) and the pinion
immediately following it, and the other (7) is

engaged to a corresponding driving motor (70) and
intended to move the pinions (5) located away from 

the seaming station (S).
Apparatus in accordance with claim 2,
characterized by the fact that said means for

moving the pallets (2) comprises a connecting rod
(8) in correspondence with the lower base of each

pallet (2), which, on one side, is hinged to the
base of the corresponding pallet (2) and, on the

other side, co-operates, within the section
comprised between the loading station (C) and the

seaming station (S), with a corresponding drive
chain (9) which is engaged by a driving motor (90)

and co-operates, within the section in
correspondance of the seaming station (S), with a

drive chain (10) engaged by a driving motor (11)
operating at a speed different from that of the

motor (90).
Apparatus in accordance with claim
3, characterized by the fact that said means for

moving the pallets (2) comprises a pair of driving
chains (12, 13), acting on the bases of the pallets

(2), each of which is supported by a guide element
(120, 130) made of a technopolymerous material, one

(12) of which is engaged with a corresponding
driving motor (121) and intended to drive pallets

(2) of the shapes (1) located outside the seaming
station (C) and the other (13) is engaged with a 

corresponding driving motor (131) and intended to
drive the pallets (2) of the shapes (1) in

correspondence with the seaming station (C).
