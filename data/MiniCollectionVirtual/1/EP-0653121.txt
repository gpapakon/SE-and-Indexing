<ABSTRACT>
A digital audio synchroniser includes one or a pair of buffer stores (12, 16) in series with a digital interpolating filter (14). A control circuit (18) detects when there is a "slip" between input and output, requiring loss or addition of a sample, and the filter executes a delay adjustment cycle in response thereto. The filter (14) takes the form of a substantially all-pass infinite-impulse-response filter of recursive form using feedback (Figures 4, 5, 6 or 7) which is found to give subjectively good performance although it introduces a frequency-dependent group delay, is also easy to implement, and has low overall delay.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a digital audio synchroniser, which 
receives digital audio signals and synchronises them with a 
reference. Digital audio signals are sampled signals. They are 
streams of numbers. The nominal sample rate is typically 48kHz. 
Signals that have exactly the same sample rate can be mixed or 
multiplexed relatively easily. Signals that have different sample 
rates can not. Even slight differences, such as with two 
independently-sourced signals of nominally the same sample rate, 
cause problems. Typical equipment behaviour with a signal that is, 
for example, one-tenth of a Hertz too fast is to omit one sample 
every ten seconds. With signals that are too slow, samples are 
repeated. Either way the "sample slips" are heard as small clicks 
in the audio. The normal way of avoiding these clicks is to 
frequency lock the sources to a common timing reference. This is 
not always possible. An alternative is to pass the unsynchronised 
signals via "synchronisers", to create versions which are locked to 
the reference. The oldest type of digital audio synchroniser is the "buffer 
store" synchroniser, see e.g. Gilchrist, N.H.C., "Sampling-rate 
synchronisation of digital sound signals by variable delay", EBU 
Review - Technical, No. 183, October 1980. This applies a delay of 
perhaps several hundred sample periods to the signal, and 
accommodates fast or slow signals by allowing the delay steadily to 
increase or decrease. The samples are passed without modification 
until the delay reaches some maximum or minimum limit, when a large 
adjustment must take place. Disruptions of the audio are hence 
much less frequent than with normal sample slipping, but they are 
also much bigger. The main problem with buffer store 
synchronisers is the long and variable delay that they introduce.  
 The most common type of digital audio synchroniser is the 
"interpolating" synchroniser. Like the "buffer store" type this 
lets most samples through unmodified, but when a slip is imminent it 
cycles through a processing sequence of the type illustrated in 
Figure 1. The sequence produces k calculated output samples but 
uses up k+1 (or k-1) input samples. Hence the hard slip is 
substituted by a more gradual adjustment of the delay. The aim is 
to create an output that is a time-warped version of the input. 
The duration and shape of the delay adjustment cycle are chosen to 
make it inaudible. A block diagram of an interpolating synchroniser 10 is shown 
in Figure 2. An input FIFO (first in, first out)

A digital audio synchroniser comprising at least one 
buffer store (12,16) capable of being written to and read 

from at different respective rates in series with a 
substantially all-pass digital interpolating filter (14) 

which provides a variable delay, and control means (18) 
coupled to the buffer store (12,16) and the interpolating 

filter (14) and being responsive to timing signals present at 
the input and the output of the digital audio synchroniser 

such that when a "slip" is indicated by the input and output 
timing signals the control means (18) commands the 

interpolating filter (14) to execute a delay adjustment 
cycle, characterised in that the interpolating filter (14) is 

a recursive infinite-impulse-response filter. 
A synchroniser according to claim 1, in which there are 
two buffer stores (12,16), one preceding (12) and one 

following (16) the interpolating filter (14).

audio synchroniser in accordance with claim 1 or 2. 
A method of synchronising a digital audio signal with a 
timing reference, comprising applying the signal to a series 

circuit including at least one buffer store (12,16) capable 
of being written to and read from at different respective 

rates and a substantially all-pass digital interpolating 
filter (14) which provides a variable delay, and controlling 

the buffer store (12,16) and the interpolating filter (14) in 
dependence upon timing signals present at the input and the 

output of the digital audio synchroniser such that when a 
"slip" is detected the interpolating filter (14) executes a 

delay adjustment cycle, characterised in that the 
interpolating filter (14) has a recursive infinite-impulse-response 

function.
