<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a control unit for the electric main drive of a printing machine, the electric main drive (9) cooperating with a motor (10), a brake (11) and a tachogenerator (12). The machine control of the control unit of the printing machine is connected to a multiplicity of signal transmitters (5) (sensors). It is intended always to ensure that the printing machine does not run at too high a rotational speed, as a function of the machine condition recorded by means of the signal transmitters. According to the invention, for this purpose provision is made for the arrangement, apart from the machine control, of a monitoring unit (14) in addition, which records the switching conditions of the signal transmitters, forms therefrom the highest possible permissible rotational speed and compares this value with the actual rotational speed value supplied by the tachogenerator. As soon as the actual rotational speed value exceeds this upper limit, the electric main drive is brought to a standstill.

Control system for a printing press in which a press 
control is connected with a plurality of signal 

emitters and via the press control, control of the 
electrical main drive to drive the motor takes 

place, to which is attached a brake as well as a 
tachogenerator, characterised in that a monitoring 

system (14) is provided which is connected with the 
signal emitters (5), the tachogenerator (12) as well 

as the electrical main drive (9), that the 
monitoring system (14) is constructed in such a way 

as to determine for each of the circuit conditions 
of signal emitter (5) a highest possible permissible 

rotational speed of the motor (10) and to carry out 
a comparison of the actual rotational value of the 

motor (10) provided by the tachogenerator (12) with 
the respectively determined permissible rotational 

speed, whereon stopping of the electrical main drive 
(9) takes place if the actual rotational speed value 

of the motor (10) is larger than the determined 
permissible rotational speed value. 
Control system according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the monitoring system (14) is connected with 

the signal emitters (5) via a separate bus system. 
Control system according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the switching condition of the signal 

emitter (5) can be interrogated cyclically by the 
monitoring system (14). 
Control system according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the main protection 

(13) of the electrical main drive (9) as well as the 
brake (11) can be switched via the monitoring system 

(14).  
 
Control system according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that via the monitoring 

system (14), the rapid stop terminal (15) of the 
electrical main drive (9) can be switched. 
Control system according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the normal stopping 

terminal (16) of the electrical main drive (9) can 
be switched via the monitoring system (14). 
Control system according to Claim 5 and 6, 
characterised in that the switching of the rapid 

stopping terminal (15) and of the normal stopping 
terminal (16) results both via a computer (7) 

continuously connected to the machine control (3) 
and also via the monitoring system (14). 
Control system according to Claim 4 and 5, 
characterised in that on emission of an emergency 

stop signal via a signal emitter (5), both via the 
computer (7) connected with the machine control (3) 

and also via the monitoring system (14), switching 
of the rapid stop terminal (15) takes place and that 

on non-immediate drop in rotational speed of the 
actual rotational speed value provided by the 

tachogenerator (12) of the motor (10), switching of

Control system according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the switching 

condition of the brakes (11) can be sensed by the 
monitoring unit (14) and that switching of the main 

protection (13) takes place if, with the brake (11) 
released, the tachogenerator (12) produces no 

signal.
