<ABSTRACT>
A process for sensitizing plastic surfaces prior to etching, 
which sensitization enhances the coverage and adhesiveness of 

the subsequent plate. The process of the invention uses 
limonene, solutions of limonene and emulsions of limonene as 

the sensitizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process used in preparing plastic surfaces so that the surface as 
treated can be effectively plated with an adherent coating. The plating of plastic parts is well known and of considerable commercial importance because the 
desirable characteristics of both the plastic and the metal are efficiently utilized in many 
applications. Thus a significant demand exists for metal plated plastic parts of all types. This 
includes not only plated plastic parts in general, but also the plated through-holes of printed 
circuit boards. In general, the process of plating plastics consists of etching the plastic surface 
followed by conditioning, activation and metallization. The problems in plating plastics are well known in the art. One of the most serious problems is 
providing a plate which is sufficiently adherent to the plastic surface. Another equally 
troublesome problem is providing for complete and even coverage of the plastic surface. Various 
methods have been employed in the past to rectify these problems. One approach is to provide 
for a plastic surface pre-etch sensitizer which will sensitize the plastic surface and thereby allow 
the subsequent plastic etch to more effectively etch the plastic surface. It has been demonstrated 
that through this approach of etching a sensitized plastic surface more effectively both improved 
coverage and adhesion can be achieved. It is thought that improved coverage is achieved in this 
way because the rougher plastic surface adsorbs more plating catalyst and thereby plates more 
efficiently. It is also thought that the increased adhesion of the plate to the surface is due to the 
increased roughness of the etched plastic surface.  
 Various sensitizers are known in the art U.S. Patent No. 3,758,332 discloses the use of 
chemicals such as methyl ethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, pyridine, dimethylformamide and 
various alcohol mixtures. U.S. Patent No. 4,125,649 reveals the use of halogenated alcohols, 
ketones and aldehydes as sensitizers for polysulfone resins. U.S. Patent No. 4,775,557 discloses 
the use of a compound of the general formula, R1 (OCnH2n)m O-R2 as a sensitizer for 
polycarbonate resins, wherein R1 and R2 are selected from aryl or alkyl groups containing from 
1-4 carbon atoms, n is 2 to 4 and m is 1 to 5. Finally U.S. Patent Nos. 3,579,365 and 3,563,784 
disclose an aqueous emulsion of turpentine with various surfactants as a sensitizing solution for 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). Various etchants for
