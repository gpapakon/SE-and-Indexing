<ABSTRACT>
A stick-wrapper is described for a plurality of toast 
slices (1), comprising a package (5,9) of corrugated 

cardboard having opposite ends (7,8) in face-to-face 
contact with respective toast slices (1a, 1b) at the ends 

of the stick, which ends (7,8) are each formed by two 
walls (13,14) associated by a spacer (17) constituted by 

an end flap obtained by folding a perimetral portion 
(17a) of a wall (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to packaging for 
friable baked products such as slices of toasted bread 
(commonly called toast slices) and like food products 
which have a substantially regular flat form. More particularly, this invention relates to a wrapper in 
which a plurality of baked products of the said type, for 
example toast slices, disposed in a stack of vertically arranged 
slices in close 
alignment to protect one another, are tightly wrapped in 
a sheet of, for example, appropriate paper or card 
material to constitute a "stick", (as disclosed for. ex. in 
EP-A-0 474 981). Solely by way of example, hereinafter in the description 
and in the subsequent claims, reference will be made to 
a "stick-wrapper" of toasted slices, it being however 
clear that the invention is not limited to this, but 
extends to a stick-wrapper for any type of baked products 
which have similar characteristics of friability and 
generally flat form. It is known that toast slices, especially when they best 
satisfy the organoleptic characteristics to which they 
aspire, have such a high degree of friability that even 
a small knock or stress, even if not accidental, is 
enough to break them into fragments; and it is known that  
 
the said friability is greatly accentuated in the central 
part of the toast slices where they have a reduced 
thickness with respect to the peripheral parts, and in 
particular the perimeter. This makes the manual operation of spreading the toast 
slices with various ingredients such as butter, jam and 
the like particularly delicate. Because of this friability it is especially necessary 
that the packaging of toast slices, in particular the 
stick-wrapper thereof, is structured to protect the toast 
slices from knocks and/or stresses which they may 
experience due to the various manipulations to which the 
packages are subjected from the time they leave the 
packaging machine to the point at which they are "opened" 
by the consumer. Such protection must be particularly effective at the 
opposite ends or short sides of the stick-wrapper where 
the respective central portions of the first and last 
toast slice of the packet are located. For this purpose the prior art packaging of toast slices 
considered here provides and teaches the use of an 
"appropriate wrapper", constituted by the so-called 
single faced corrugated cardboard, with which is formed 
a parallelepipedic container having the same dimensions as  
 
those of the stack of toast slices intended for it. The use of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stick-wrapper for toast slices in a stack of vertically 
arranged slices with abutting major faces, 

comprising a package (5,9) of cardboard, 
corrugated cardboard and similar flexible material 

shaped substantially as a parallelepipedic container having 
opposite ends (7,8,19) in substantial face-to-face 

contact with a major face of respective toast slices (1a,1b) at the ends 
of the said stack, characterised in that each 

of the said ends (7,8,19) comprises at least two walls 
(13,14; 20,21) of equal dimension associated in mutually spaced relation by 

the interposition of at least one spacer (17,22) having 
at least the width corresponding to the width of said at least two walls. 
A stick-wrapper according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the said spacer (17,22) is made of the same 

material as that of the said package (5,9). 
A stick-wrapper according to Claim 1, characterised 
by the fact that the said walls (13,14) are identical. 
A stick-wrapper according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the said walls (13,14) are obtained from the said 

starting blank (15) of cardboard, corrugated cardboard 
and similar flexible materials by folding about a fold 

line (16). 
A stick-wrapper according to Claim 4, characterised  
 

by the fact that the said spacer is constituted by an end 
flap (17) obtained from the said starting blank (15) by 

folding a corresponding portion (17a) about a respective 
fold line (18) which separates the said portion (17a) 

from one of the said walls (13, 14a). 
A stick-wrapper according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the said spacer is constituted by a perimetral 

frame interposed between and having the same perimetral 
dimension as the said walls (20,21).
