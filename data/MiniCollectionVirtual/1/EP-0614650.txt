<ABSTRACT>
An implantable prosthesis including a conical 
mesh plug (12) having a pleated surface (18) which conforms to 

the contours of the defect being repaired. Mesh 
filler material positioned in the plug stiffens the 

implant when it is compressed within the defect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implantable
mesh prosthesis and to a method for repairing muscle
or tissue wall defects.Various prosthetic mesh materials have been
proposed to reinforce the abdominal wall and to close
abdominal wall defects. It has been known to fold a
sheet of surgical mesh fabric into the multilayer
cone configuration 1 illustrated in Fig. 1
and defined in the preamble of Claim 1
and then
to insert the mesh plug into a hernia defect to
occlude the void. Such a multilayer prosthesis is
inherently stiff and may not fully conform to
variations in the contour of the defect, leaving gaps 
between the implant and the abdominal wall that could
potentially lead to recurrent herniation. The stiff,
multilayered mesh plug also may be susceptible to
kinking and buckling during placement.Other conical mesh plugs have been proposed
including a dart which is commercially available from
C.R. Bard, Inc., assignee of the present application,
under the name "Marlex Mesh Dart". This mesh implant
is hot molded into a stiff conical configuration
which is non-compressible and which does not conform
to irregularities in the muscle or tissue wall
defining the defect.Accordingly, the prior art lacks an implantable
mesh plug for filling and repairing muscle and tissue
wall ruptures which is adaptable to irregularities in
the shape of the defect.The present invention is an implantable
prosthesis for reinforcing and repairing
a weakened muscular wall. The prosthesis is formed
of a biologically compatible, flexible and porous 
surgical mesh fabric suitable for reinforcing tissue
and occluding tissue defects. The openings in the
mesh prosthesis become completely infiltrated with
tissue ingrowth, securing the implant to healthy
tissue surrounding the defect. The implantable
prosthesis is particularly indicated for the repair
of hernias in the abdominal cavity including inguinal
(direct and indirect), femoral, incisional and
recurrent.The implantable mesh plug is compressible into a
slender shape which fits within a hernia opening,
filling all, or at least a significant portion, of
the defect. The implant includes a pleated surface
which increases the pliability of the implant,
allowing the prosthesis to conform to irregularities
in the tissue or muscle wall surrounding the
opening. A filler body contained within the plug
imparts bulk to the device, improving its handling
characteristics. The filler also stiffens the
implant when it is compressed within the rupture,
ensuring a snug fit of the implant against the

<CLAIMS>
An implantable prosthesis (10) for repairing a tissue or muscle wall defect comprising
a hollow

conical or cylindrical
plug (12) formed of a surgical mesh fabric, said plug (12) being

insertable into said tissue or muscle wall defect, characterized in that said plug
(12) has, in its uncompressed uninserted state, a pre-formed pleated (18) surface and is flexibly

radially compressible from its first uninserted configuration into a second configuration,
which is smaller than the first configuration, for insertion into the defect,

the inserted plug being flexibly adaptable to the shape of the defect into which it
is inserted, so that said plug (12) securely fits therein and occludes the defect.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 1 wherein said flexible plug (12)
includes a conical plug (12).
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 1 or 2 wherein said pleated (18)
surface is provided along the entire surface of said plug (12).
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 3, wherein the pleats (18) have rounded
outside peaks (24) and pointed valleys (26).
The implantable prosthesis recited in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
pleated (18) surface structure has been made permanent by a hot molding process.
The implantable prosthesis recited in any one of the preceeding claims wherein
said plug includes a closed rounded end (20), an open end and a cavity (22)

extending therebetween, and wherein said prosthesis further includes filler material
(14, 16) positioned within said cavity (22) of said plug (12) and which stiffens said

implantable prosthesis when said plug is compressed into said second configuration. 
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 6 wherein said filler material comprises
at least one filler body (14) which is formed of a surgical mesh fabric.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 7 wherein said filler body (14) includes
a plurality of mesh petals (28).
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 8 wherein said plurality of mesh petals
(28) spread outwardly towards said flexible plug when said plug is in said first

configuration.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 8 or 9 wherein said plurality of mesh
petals (28) have a common base (30).
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 10 wherein said plurality of mesh

petals (28) lean against said flexible plug when said plug is in said first configuration.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 6 wherein said filler material includes
a plurality of upstanding strips of surgical mesh fabric.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 12 wherein said plurality of upstanidng
mesh strips are attached to said closed end (20) and extend therefrom into said

cavity (22) and towards said open end.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 1 wherein said plug tapers outwardly
from a closed end (20) to a larger open end and having a cavity (22) which is

defined therebetween, and further comprising a first filler body (14) formed of
surgical mesh fabric and including a common base (30) and a plurality of petals

(28) extending upwardly from said base (30) and being spaced laterally thereabout,
said base (30) being supported by said plug so that said plurality of petals (28)

project into said cavity (22), whereby said plurality of petals (28) stiffen said 
implantable prosthesis when said plug is compressed into said second configuration.

The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 14 or 15 wherein said common base
(30) is attached to said closed end (20) of said plug.
The implantable prosthesis recited in claim 14, 15 or 16 further comprising a
second filler body (16) formed of surgical mesh fabric and having a plurality of

laterally spaced petals (28) that extend upwardly from a common base (30), said
second filler body (16) being positioned within said first filler body (14) and being
