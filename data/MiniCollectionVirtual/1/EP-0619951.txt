<ABSTRACT>
Trehalose, prepared by the method containing a step 
of allowing a non-reducing saccharide-forming enzyme to act on 

a partial starch hydrolysate exhibiting a reducing power, is 
advantageously used as an energy-supplementing saccharide 

source and used in energy-supplementing compositions as an 
effective ingredient. The saccharide source and compositions 

can be suitably used as pharmaceutical compositions for 
supplementing energy for living bodies without a fear of 

causing side effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
α-α-trehalose preparable by the method
containing a step of allowing a non-reducing saccharide-forming
enzyme to act on a partial starch hydrolysate exhibiting a
reducing power
to prepare
a composition to be administered parenterally to living bodies for
supplying energy to a living body.Saccharides, exhibiting a reducing power, such as
glucose and fructose have been used for a long time as an
energy-supplementing saccharide source. These saccharides,
however, have a relatively-poor storage stability because of
their reducing power, and, generally they become more unstable
in the coexistence of other nutritives such as amino acids and
vitamins.Therefore, establishment of an energy-supplementing
saccharide source essentially consisting of a non-reducing
saccharide such as xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, lactitol,
sucrose or trehalose has been in great demand. Among these
non-reducing saccharides, sugar alcohols of monosaccharides
such as xylitol and sorbitol have a demerit of that they may 
cause a serious diarrhea when administered to the body with an
erroneous dose and route. Sugar alcohols of disaccharides such
as maltitol and lactitol, as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication Nos. 13,699/72 and 42,506/72, are not readily
metabolized and utilized by living bodies, and actually have
been used as a sweetener for diet. Thus, these disaccharides
are not satisfactory as an energy-supplementing saccharide
source. Sucrose has a demerit of that it is readily hydrolyzed
into reducing glucose and fructose under acid conditions,
followed by resulting in exhibition of a poor storage
stability. As evident from the descriptions of "Trehalose is
low caloric because it is not substantially assimilated and
utilized by the body." and "Trehalose is not substantially
hydrolyzed by amylases, etc.", as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No.240,758/88, trehalose has been recognized as a
saccharide source which does not act as an energy source in
vivo. EP publication no. 0486315A3 discloses a process for
preparing neotrehalose and its uses, where the process
comprises allowing β-galactosidase to act on a solution
containing lactoneotrehalose to form neotrehalose and
recovering the resultant neotrehalose. The neotrehalose is
a non-reducing oligosaccharide having a satisfiable
stability and a rich and high quality sweetness and is
assimilated and utilised as an energy source in vivo when
orally administered.EP publication no. 0532807A1 discloses a composition
for supplementing

<CLAIMS>
Use of α,α-trehalose to prepare a composition to be
administered parenterally to living bodies for supplying

energy to a living body,

wherein the α,α-trehalose is
preparable by the method comprising a step of allowing a

non-reducing saccharide-forming enzyme to act on a partial
starch hydrolysate, which exhibits a reducing power, to form

a saccharide solution comprising trehalose; and optionally
feeding said saccharide solution to column chromatography

using a strong acidic cation exchange resin to increase the
purity of the trehalose.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the composition
contains at least 10 w/w % trehalose on a dry solid basis.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
composition comprises trehalose and another saccharide(s).
