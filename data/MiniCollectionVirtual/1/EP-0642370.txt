<ABSTRACT>
A combined pacemaker and defibrillator includes a heart sensor (18) to provide signals through amplifier (36) to the logic control circuit (34) which provides pacing pulses from generator (38) at a variable level depending on the action of capture detector (42), and when fibrillation is detected or the pacer pulses have reached maximum amplitude without overcoming the heart problem, the logic control (34) signals defibrillator control (40) which causes the defibrillator output (44) to supply high energy shocks to the heart electrodes (26, 28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to implantable
stimulation devices and, more
particularly, to an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) device that is capable of
detecting and treating low amplitude fibrillation.Bradycardia is a condition of the heart
where the heart beat slows to a rate that is
considered insufficient to pump an adequate supply of
blood through a patient's body. A heart rate of less
than 50 beats per minute is considered as a
bradycardia condition for most patients.One common technique for treating
bradycardia is to implant a pacemaker in the patient.
The pacemaker senses cardiac electrical activity,
which electrical activity normally accompanies a heart
beat. If the cardiac electrical activity is not
sensed, it indicates that the heart is not beating at
a prescribed rate. Stimulation pulses are then
generated and delivered to an appropriate heart
chamber, either the atrium or the ventricle, in order
to stimulate the muscle tissue of the heart to
contract, thereby forcing the heart to beat at a rate
that is faster than the intrinsic rate. A pacemaker
operating to maintain the heart rate at a rate that is
faster than a bradycardia rate is referred to as a
bradycardia-support pacemaker. Bradycardia-support pacing is realized in a
pacemaker by defining a period of time, referred to
generally as the "escape interval," that is slightly
longer than the period of time between heart beats of
a heart experiencing bradycardia. For example, if the
heart is beating at a rate of 50 beats per minute, the
time period between consecutive heart beats is 1200
milliseconds. Thus, in a bradycardia-support
pacemaker, if it is desired that the heart rate never
slow to a rate less than 50 beats per minute, the
escape interval of the pacemaker is set to an
appropriate value that causes a stimulation pulse to
always be generated if more than 1200 milliseconds
elapse since the last sensed heart beat. If a heart
beat occurs before 1200 milliseconds have elapsed,
then that indicates the heart is beating at a rate
faster than 50 beats per minute, and no stimulation
pulse need be generated. Upon electrically sensing
such a "natural" (nonstimulated) heart beat within the
allotted time period, the escape interval is reset,
and a new escape interval is started. A stimulation
pulse will be generated at the conclusion of this new
escape interval unless a natural heart beat is again
sensed during the escape interval. In this way,
stimulation pulses are generated "on demand," i.e.,
only when needed, in order to
