 cells with tumor necrosis factor- alpha  and interleukin-3 or with GM-CSF. The invention also includes cellular compositions of dendritic cells produced by this method. Dendritic cells of the invention can be used widely as components in many diagnostic and therapeutic systems, including improved mixed lymphocyte reactions for assaying tissue rejection, adoptive immunotherapy of cancer, adoptive immunotherapy of HIV and other viral infections, and SCID-hu mice for human antibody production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to an in vitro method of
generating human dendritic cells, and, more specifically, to therapeutic
and diagnostic uses of the generated cells.Dendritic cells are a system of antigen-presenting cells that
function to initiate several immune responses such as the sensitization
of MHC-restricted T cells, the rejection of organ transplants, and the
formation of T cell-dependent antibodies. Dendritic cells are found in
many nonlymphoid tissues but can migrate via the afferent lymph or the
blood stream to the T cell-dependent areas of lymphoid organs. They
are found in the skin, where they are named Langerhans cells, and are
also present in the mucosa. They represent the sentinels of the immune
system within the peripheral tissues where they can acquire antigens.
As these cells express CD4 and can be infected in vitro by HIV, they are
likely to present a port of entry of HIV virus in vivo: e.g. Knight et al., pp.
145 in Racz, et al., editors, "Accessory Cells in HIV and Other Retroviral
Infections" (Karger, Basel, 1991); Ramsauer et al., pp. 155 in Racz, et
al., editors (cited above). The isolation of human dendritic cells from
peripheral blood has only recently been achieved and only small
numbers of cells can be generated, e.g. Freudenthal et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci., Vol. 87, pp. 7698 (1990). The in vitro generation of large
numbers of human dendritic cells would present an important advantage
for priming in vitro human naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, for screening
agents that may interfere with HIV infection, for generating primary and
secondary in vivo response of human B cells in SCID-hu mice
reconstituted with human T and B cells, and for constructing a more
sensitive mixed-lymphocyte reaction assay.A major impediment to transplantation of allogeneic tissue and
organs is graft rejection by the transplant recipient. The cell-mediated
immune reaction of the recipient, or host, to the donor tissue plays an 
important role in the rejection process. The cell-mediated immune
response has two important phases: (i) recognition, when host cells
recognize the donor cell as foreign in the context of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC); and (ii) destruction, when the host
cells respond by attacking the foreign cells. As part of the attacking
process, a number of responder cells undergo proliferation and acquire
cytotoxicity - that is, the ability to kill donor cells displaying the
appropriate antigens. Thus, cell-mediated immunity can be described in
terms of two measurable
