<ABSTRACT>
A cutout (11) is made in a web (7) from above, a locking element (12) being inserted into said cutout. The cutout (11) connects an upper outer side of the web (7) to a transverse bore (9) in an arm (14) of the web (7). In the assembled state, the web (7) is inserted into a cutout (10) of the cylinder pocket (4) and connected by a transverse pin (6). In order to secure the transverse pin (6) against longitudinal displacement in the cylinder pocket (4), said transverse pin (6) exhibits an encircling groove (14) into which the locking element (12) engages from above. In order to exchange the web (7), the rotary cylinder (1) is rotated about its longitudinal axis such that the cylinder pocket (4) is at the top. Upon rotation, the locking element (12) moves downwards due to its gravitational force and releases the transverse pin (6). The rotary cylinder (1) according to the invention can be lengthened or shortened on site, without reducing the security, by exchanging the web (7).

Rotary locking cylinder for a security lock, having a 
cylinder housing (13) and a web, which is inserted into a 

recess (10) of the cylinder housing (13) and secured by 
means of a transverse pin (6), characterized in that an 

interlocking element (12) is disposed above the 
transverse pin (6) so as to displaceable in a recess (11) 

of the web (7) and said interlocking element (12) in its 
installed position engages downwards into a recess (14) 

of the transverse pin (6) in order to secure the latter 
against longitudinal displacement. 
Rotary locking cylinder according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the recess (14) of the transverse 

pin (6) is a circumferential groove. 
Rotary locking cylinder according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the recess (11) of the web is a 

bore which connects a top side of the web (7) to a 
transverse bore (9) of the web (7). 
Rotary locking cylinder according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the interlocking element (12) is a 

pin, and the length of said pin (12) is shorter than the 
bore (11) of the web (7), into which bore the pin (12) is 

inserted.
