<ABSTRACT>
The device prevents self-excited frictional vibrations between two bodies which are in mutual contact and move relative to one another at a speed v and between which a frictional force F(v-x) = F(v)-F1.x occurs. F(v) is a constant component of the frictional force, F1 = delta F(v)/ delta v and x =  delta x/ delta t is the vibration velocity of a body. The device has a vibration damper or vibration absorber which is connected to one of the bodies and exhibits a modal additional damping R. In this case, the additional damping R satisfies the condition  K - F1 + R

<CLAIMS>
A device for avoiding squeaking noises caused by a seal on a window pane,
particularly the side window of a motor car and which is displaceable transversely in

relation to the seal which bears on the window pane, characterised in that the seal (22, 42,
52, 62, 72, 82, 92, 102) is constructed as a hollow profile strip which is connected to a

vibration damper or absorber (25, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that in the region of maximum
deformation caused by a self-excited friction vibration, the seal (22) is provided with a

damping lining (25).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in the region of maximum
movement caused by a self-excited friction vibration, the seal (52, 62, 72) is provided with

a vibration absorber (25).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the fixing of the
seal (92, 102) on a frame part (93, 103.2) is carried out by means of vibration-damping

elastomer (95, 105).
