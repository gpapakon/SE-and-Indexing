<ABSTRACT>
A mesh grid implant of titanium or other biocompatible 
material having a plurality of orifice plate sections 

(40,42) that accept bone screws and having connecting arms 
(44) coupling each orifice plate section (40,42) with each adjacent 

orifice plate section (40,42). The length of the arm (44) and the 
included angle (46) may be set to determine the flexibility of 

the mesh grid. The arms (44) allow the mesh to cover not only 
flat bone segments but also to conform to curved, concave, 

and convex bone surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a form-fitting mesh
implant for the fixation and immobilization of bone
fragments at one or more bone fracture sites.When there is a traumatic disruption of the continuity
of a bone, it must be set such that there is no relative
motion of the bone fragments at the fracture site during
the healing process. If there is such relative movement,
surrounding tissues are irritated thus causing pain and
requiring the time fracture healing to be extended. Thus
proper fixation and immobilization of bone fragments
require an implant that can be moulded or formed in
substantially three dimensions in many cases, which is
extremely difficult to accomplish. According to currently
used techniques, if a mesh implant is used to cover the
area of a lost craniotomy bone flap, the mesh, when formed
or shaped, develops sides that overlap, turn upwardly, or
create folds. Thus the current mesh systems overlap or
curl when the mesh implant is shaped three dimensionally in
order to adapt to a curved shape because the connecting
arms, that connect plate sections having orifices therein
for receiving a bone screw, cannot be expanded and those at
the outer edge cannot be compressed a sufficient degree
necessary to form a relatively smooth surface. Thus the
overlapping edges and raised areas can cause lacerations of
the overlying tissue at can result in infections.
Such a form-fitting implant, comprising all the features of the
preamble of claim 1 is for example disclosed in EP-A- 433 852.Further, in the currently used techniques,
reconstruction of the eye socket, including orbital walls,
floor, and roof, is achieved with bone and alloplastic
materials such as titanium plate implants to repair the
defect. As an example, regular meshes or grid plates can
be introduced and secured to the orbital rim with bone
screws. Because of the variable radius of the eye sockets,
a standard preformed implant usually will not fit
precisely. The surgeon's task is to manually form the mesh
implant so that the bone defect is covered in a manner such 
that the mesh material is formed to fit the original
three-dimensional curvature of the bone. This is not
achievable with conventional metal plate implants except to
a limited extent with a grid plate that has separate
sections or flaps that can be bent as a total section.Another method of fitting metal mesh plates or sheets
to the convex skull shape is by cutting out wedges in the
outer section of the plate to avoid overlapping sections
when the plate is formed into a

<CLAIMS>
A form-fitting implant for the fixation and
immobilization of bone fragments and bridging of bone

defects or gaps at one or more sites of a patient, the
implant comprising a mesh of biocompatible metallic

material having at least two plate sections (40,42) with an
orifice (41) in each plate section for receiving a bone

screw; and at least one arm (44) connecting the two plate
sections, characterised by

the arm having at least two arm sections
connected at a bend (46) such that the arm can be

selectively compressed, stretched, and contoured primarily
by deformation at the bend to fix bone fragments in a

particular anatomical shape.
An implant according to claim 1, wherein the arm has
a first width at its junctions with the plate sections and

a second smaller width (80) adjacent to the bend.
An implant according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
the arm (44) has two straight sections connected at an

angular bend (46).
An implant according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the arm includes more than one bend (FIG.

14).
An implant according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein two parallel ones of the arms connect each

of the plate sections to the same adjacent plate section
(FIG. 11).
An implant according to any one of the preceding
claims, which has a plurality of the plate sections forming

a grid with an interior area and an exterior periphery; and
four of the arms integrally formed with each plate section 

in the interior area, each arm connecting the plate section
with an adjacent plate section (FIGS. 5,7,12).
An implant according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
which has a plurality of the plate sections forming a grid

with an interior area and an exterior periphery; and three
of the arms integrally formed with each plate section in

the interior area, each arm connecting the plate section
with an adjacent plate section (FIG. 9).
An implant according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
which has a plurality of the plate sections arranged in a

lattice-like structure of rows and columns; with the arms
connecting the plate sections in each row and the plate

sections in each column; all of the arms connecting of
plate sections in the rows being bent in the same direction

and all of the arms connecting the plate sections in the
columns being bent in the same direc
tion (FIG. 12).
An implant according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
including four of the plate sections for forming a

rectangular grid; and four arms, wherein each of the arms
is integrally formed with two of the plate sections to form

the rectangular grid (FIG. 15).
