<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a needle tip protective device (22). In one embodiment the needle tip
protective device (22) includes a needle guard (41) that is slidably mounted on a

hypodermic needle (10) having a needle tip (11) located at the distal end of the needle
(10). The needle guard (41) contains a movable needle trap (41) that is biased against or

toward the hypodermic needle (10). The needle trap (41) advances over the tip (11) of the
needle, entrapping the needle tip (11) as the needle guard (41) is urged forward near the

sharpened distal end of the hypodermic needle (10). A tether (24), or other limiting
means, limits the forward movement of the needle guard (41) along the needle (10). In

one embodiment, the needle guard is manually urged forward along the shaft of the needle
by the user. In yet another embodiment, a spring, or other biasing means (19), is used to

move the needle guard (41) along the shaft of the needle (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to needle tip guards for hypodermic needles.The advent of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), combined with the increasing
incidence of other bloodborne pathogens such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), present health care workers with an occupational hazard
unprecedented in modem medicine. The risk of contracting HIV from a needlestick injury
is approximately 1 in 250, but for those who contract HIV infection as a result of a
needlestick injury the risk becomes 1 in 1. The risk of contracting the more contagious
HBV as a result of a needlestick injury ranges from 1 in 6 to 1 in 30.There are also over twenty more known blood borne pathogens which are transmitted via
blood and bodily fluids.The presence of any of these pathogens in patients poses a risk to healthcare workers
when invasive procedures are performed. Infectious diseases are now the third leading
cause of death, behind heart disease and cancer, signifying a growing need for safer
hypodermic equipment. Ten years ago, infectious diseases were classified as the fifth
leading cause of death, they are now ranked third. This increase of infectious disease is
attributed mainly to the over-use of antibiotics and the growing availability of re-usable,
hollow-bore hypodermic equipment.As the population of infected individuals increases, more people will be treated by
healthcare workers, further increasing the odds of disease transmission from patient to
healthcare worker. Also, the use of disposable hypodermic equipment is increasing at
approximately 7% per annum.Additionally, a meaningful number of clusters of patient to patient transmission in the
healthcare setting has been identified throughout the world. Early data suggests improper
infection control techniques contribute directly to this increase: including improper use of 
hypodermic equipment, multiple-dose medicine vials; and failure to change protective
gloves and gear for each new patient.Recent studies also cite the discovery of significant blood contamination on re-usable
blood collection vacuum tube holders which are routinely used to collect blood from
different patients. Common practice is to ship one vacuum tube holder with 100 blood
collection needles. It is likely that new routes of disease transmission will also be found in
the future. Healthcare workers are increasingly at risk to disease transmission and nurses
perform the majority of invasive hypodermic procedures, such as injecting medicine,
collecting blood and
