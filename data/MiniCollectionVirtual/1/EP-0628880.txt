<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoreceptor to be used in imaging technology, such as 
electrophotography, electrostatic imaging and the like, and in particular, to a photoreceptor 
the stability of which is improved greatly by incorporating a specific stabilizer, and to 
a process for stabilizing the charge generating organic layer against oxidative degradation 
by incorporating a specific stabilizer. In recent years, various electrophotographic photoreceptors using organic compounds as 
their photoconductors have been developed, most of which comprise a charge generating 
layer and a charge transporting layer. It is expected that such electrophotographic photoreceptors using organic photoconductors 
allow further improvement in electrophotographic sensitivity and the like because of the 
easiness and flexibility in designing them. Another advantage of photoreceptors using organic 
photoconductors may be high production yield due to the easiness in forming films 
composing charge generation and charge transporting layers. The electrophotographic photoreceptors repeatedly experience various image formation 
processes in electrophotographic machines, during which they have to exhibit stable performance. However, prior art electrophotographic photoreceptors using organic photoconductors 
have a shortcoming that the charging-up characteristics thereof will be degraded during repeated 
operations, with the result that the obtained image quality deteriorates gradually. It is assumed that the influences of corona charging-up are main causes for the degradation 
of the above photoreceptors because they are continuously exposed to corona discharging 
environment when they are used in electrophotographic machines. It is assumed that the 
organic photocondutors are damaged by attack of active species such as ozone or the like 
generated by corona discharging, and the degradation may be accelerated as the times of 
operation increases. In electrophotographic photoreceptors using organic photoconductors,  
 
negative charging-up is used conventionally. But, negative charging-up usually generates 
more ozone than positive charging-up, which is regarded as a main cause for the tendency 
that organic photoreceptors using negative charging-up are more sensitive to degradation 
than other photoreceptors using positive charging up. As methods for preventing the aforementioned degradation of electrophotographic photoreceptors, 
there have been proposed such methods as those described in Japanese Patent 
Application
