<ABSTRACT>
A construction for processing crop residues lying 
on the field, such as hay, comprising at least one carrier 

element which is pivotal and drivable about an at least 
predominantly upwardly directed shaft, to which working 

members (1) are attached via arms (2, 16), a working member 
(1) being provided with a connecting member (4) which is 

secured to an arm section with the aid of a clamping member, 
whilst the construction includes further connection means (7, 

11, 19 - 28), with the aid of which a working member (1) can 
be adjusted to a finite number of positions relative to an 

arm section (5, 17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hay making
machine, comprising at least one carrier element which is
rotatably drivable about an at least predominantly upwardly
directed shaft and to which working members are attached
via arms, each working member being provided with a
connecting member which is secured to an arm section with
the aid of a clamping member,
wherein the
clamping member is provided with a projection which in
cooperation with the connecting member of a working member counteracts
in one direction any displacement of the working
member transversely to the direction of the clamping
force.Such a construction is, for example, disclosed
in the British patent specification 1 217 392. In the
known construction the position of a working member can
be adjustable in a number of positions by using special
formed clamping blocks of different construction. By
replacing one clamping block by another clamping block
the position of a tine can be changed. According to a
further embodiment described in the same patent specification
the clamping block is omitted, so that there is no
fixed angle of inclination of a working element. A disadvantage
of these solutions is, that this changing of the
tine position is complicated and time consuming.The present invention has for its object to
provide a different and simple construction for adjustment
of the tines. According to the invention,
a hay making machine has the features set out in Claim 1. In a further embodiment, it is advantageous,
according to the invention, that the
connecting element is locked with
the aid of turned-over portions which bear on the leading
and the trailing edges of an arm section. In accordance
with the invention, the apertures in the connecting
element may be provided such that replacing of it, about
an upwardly directed axis and through 180°, doubles the
number of possible positions of a working member, determined
by the number of apertures.For a better understanding of the invention and
to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference
will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a plan view of a working member
which, in accordance with the invention, is attached to
the arm of a hay making implement;Figure 2 is a view taken in the direction of
the arrow II in Figure 1;Figure 3 is a plan view taken in the direction
of the arrow III in Figure 1, andFigure 4 is a cross-sectional view taken on the
line IV - IV in Figure 1.The invention is in no way limited to the
embodiments depicted
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hay making machine, comprising at least one
carrier element which is rotatably drivable about an at least

predominantly upwardly directed shaft and to which working
members are attached via arms (2), each working member (1)

being provided with a connecting member (4) which is secured
to an arm section (5) with the aid of a clamping member (6),

wherein the clamping member (6) is provided with a projection
(14) which in cooperation with the connecting member (4) of

the working member (1) counteracts in one direction any,
displacement of the working member (1) transversely to the

direction of the clamping force, characterized in that each
working member (1) includes further connecting means (7, 11),

with the aid of which the respective working member (1) can
be adjusted to a finite number of positions relative to an

arm section (5), the connecting means (7, 11) comprising a
positioning element (11) provided with a plurality of

apertures (12), which positioning element (11) relative to the
arm section (5) is locked against sliding in or opposite to

the direction of rotation of the carrier element, whereby
each working member (1) can be adjusted in said finite number

of positions with respect to the arm section (5). 
A hay making machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the

positioning element (11) is locked
in position with the aid of turned-over portions (13)

which bear against the leading and the trailing edge of
an arm section (5).
A hay making machine as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that the apertures (12) are arranged

such in the positioning element (11) that when it is
replaced through 180° about an upwardly extending axis,

the number of possible positions of a working element (1)
determined by the number of apertures (12), is doubled. 
A hay making machine as claimed in one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that the individual

positions of a working member (1) differ by always
approximately a fixed number of degrees relative to each

other, this number being in the range from one to three
degrees, preferably two degrees.
A hay making machine as claimed in one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that the contour

of the arm section (5) corresponds at least approximately
to the contour of the coils of a working member (1).
A hay making machine as claimed in one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that the arm

section (5) is
predominantly horizontal.
