<ABSTRACT>
An airflow regulating device for regulating the airflow through an opening comprises one 
or more vanes (
7
) extending across an aperture (
5
) and movable between a first position 
in which the airflow through the aperture (
5
) is reduced to a minimum and a second 
position in which the airflow through the aperture (
5
) is a maximum. A surface of said 
vane(s) (
7
) is acted on by the airflow to move the vane(s) (
7
) towards the first position. 
Control means (
21
) are provided comprising non-linear compression spring means (
23
) 
acting on the vane(s) (
7
) so as to bias the vane(s) towards the second position and 
adjustment means (
33
) are provided for varying the action of the spring means (
23
). The 
non linearality of the spring means (
23
) is such that spring strength increases when the 
compression force acting thereon increases and 
vice
versa

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air flow regulating device. Any air system which requires a controlled air volume flow rate at a particular location of 
the system and where the air flow arriving at that location has a variable pressure, some 
form of regulating device is required to compensate for variations in air pressure, either 
manually or automatically. In an air ducting system in a building, for example, a series of manually adjustable 
dampers could be used to give a required air flow from various air outlets. In a more simple case, a window in a building can be manually adjusted so as to vary the 
airflow therethrough so as to compensate for exterior conditions such as wind force, wind 
direction,air temperature etc. Because wind conditions change continuously it is difficult, 
if not impossible to achieve any consistent flow manually. The present invention seeks to provide an airflow regulating device in which the device is 
sensitive to the condition of the arriving air and controls the airflow in response thereto in 
a relatively simple manner. According to the invention, an airflow regulating device for regulating the airflow 
through an opening comprising one or more vanes extending across an aperture and 
movable between a first position in which the airflow through the aperture is reduced to a 
minimum and a second position in which the airflow through the aperture is a maximum, 
a surface of said vane(s) being acted on by the airflow to move the vane(s) towards the 
first position and control means comprising non-linear compression spring means acting 
on the vane(s) so as to bias the vane(s) towards the second position and adjustment means 
for varying the action of the spring means, the non linearality of the spring means being 
such that spring strength increases when the compression force acting thereon increases 
and viceversa. The spring means may comprise a spirally wound spring of pyramidal exponential or 
parabolic shape. The spring means may comprise a plurality of springs of different 
strengths connected in series. Alternatively the spring means comprises a spring formed 
from wire of varying cross sectional area.  The spring strength of the spring means may be adjustable so as to vary the action of the 
vane(s) against the airflow. Temperature sensing means may be provided for controlling the spring strength in 
dependence thereon so as to increase the flow of air with increases in temperature and 
viceversa or to decrease the flow of air with increases of temperature and
