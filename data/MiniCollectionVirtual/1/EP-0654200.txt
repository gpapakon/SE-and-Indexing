<ABSTRACT>
A color video projection system (10), in which images of three separate colors (22, 24, 26) are separately projected to converge on a common region of the screen (20), is provided with automatic convergence control to ensure that three images are precisely superimposed upon each other. A test pattern of a number of pattern units (36, 38) of an intensity (42, 44, 48) that varies over each unit in a similar manner is imaged on a two dimensional matrix array of charged coupled devices (CCD) (32). The test pattern is projected in sequence by each of the three CRT projectors (50, 54, 58, 14, 16, 18) of the system, and during the projection of the test pattern, the position of the centroid (40) of each unit of the test pattern is determined from the light intensity pattern received by the CCD matrix array, and stored (112). The centroid positions of each unit of a test pattern of two of the projectors are compared with positions of the centroids of each unit of the test pattern projected by a third one of projectors. The comparison develops an error signal for each unit of each test pattern, enabling convergence correction signals to be fed to convergence control deflections coils (120, 122, 124) of each of the cathode ray tubes (50, 54, 58) so as to effectively shift each of two of the images to superposition with the third.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multi-color
projection systems, and more particularly concerns methods
and apparatus for automatic correction of misconvergence of
plural images of a multi-image projection system.A common type of color projection system employs three
separate but closely positioned cathode ray tube projection
devices, each provided with a separate projection lens
system that directs the image of each cathode ray tube to
a common region of a projection screen so that three
separate monochromatic color images are superposed on one
another to provide a single multi-color image. Precision
of superposition of the three different color images is
essential in such a system to avoid degraded resolution and
rough, blurred composite images. To enhance precision of
convergence of all three separately colored monochromatic
images, various types of convergence systems have been
developed. Manual systems are labor intensive, tedious and
extremely time consuming, requiring time measured in the
order of hours, for example. In addition, the manipulator
must have technical knowledge or training sufficient to 
execute the correction. Such ability is seldom available
to the average video projector purchaser. Automatic
convergence systems avoid disadvantages of manual systems
but are subject to limitations with respect to accuracy,
speed and reliability. For example, U. S. Patent US-A-4,999,703
for Automatic Image Correction Method and Apparatus For
Projectors Utilizing Cathode Ray Tubes provides for
automatic convergence by use of a mechanically scanning
optical head that samples certain predetermined areas of a
projected test pattern. The head is mechanically moved to
scan areas of the projection screen in sequence, and of
course requires various mechanical scanning elements and
motors. Mechanical elements detract from system
reliability. The requirement for servo motors greatly adds
to cost and complexity of the system. Moreover, because of
the sequential physical scanning of such systems, achieving
convergence still requires several minutes of time. The
system of Patent US-A-4,999,703 thus involves decreased
reliability and increased cost while accuracy of
convergence is dependent upon accuracy limits of the motion
of the motors.Another similar type of convergence system employing
a lens and sensor that are moved as a unit to point to
different areas of the screen by a pair of stepper motors
is described in an article entitled "A Versatile Automatic
Convergence System for a Three-Lens CRT Projector", by
