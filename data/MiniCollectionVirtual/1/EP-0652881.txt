<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of (-)-eserethole, of formula (I) starting from (+-)-eserethole, or from mixtures of (+)-and (-)-eserethole in which the latter enantiomer prevails, by treating (+-)-eserethole or mixtures of (+)- and (-)-eserethole enriched in the latter enantiomer, with 0.5-0.7 mole (per mole of the enantiomeric mixture) of a resolution agent, to yield a (-)-eserethole salt less soluble than the corresponding (+)-eserethole salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF (-)-ESERETHOLE FROM MIXTURES OF (-) AND (+)-ESERETHOLEThe present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (-)-eserethole, of formula (I)
 starting from (±)-eserethole, or from mixtures of (+)- and (-)-eserethole in which the latter enantiomer prevails.(-)-Eserethole is known to be the main interme¬ diate for the synthesis of (-)-eserine (physostigmine) , which is a naturally occurring alkaloid of great interest for the treatment of Alzheimer'disease (see, for example, L.J. Thai and coll., N. Engl. J. Med. 308, 720 (1983) and Ann. Neurol. 13, 491 (1983); L. Gustafson and coll., Psychopharmacol. 93, 31 (1987)).In literature (T. Kobayashi, Annalen der Chemie 143-163 (1938), the resolution of (±)-eserethole by means of tartaric acid, following a very laborious pro¬ cedure and in unsatisfactory yields, is described. According to Kobayashi, (±)-eserethole is in fact treated in alcohol medium with (+)-tartaric acid in a 1:1 molar ratio. Thereby a mixture of (÷)-eserethole (÷)-tartrate and (-)-eserethole (+)-tartrate precipita¬ tes, the first one prevailing. (This mixture must be recrystallized at least 5 times from alcohol, to obtain pure (+)-eserethole (+)-tartrate in a 50% yield on 

theory). Precipitation mother liquors are alkalinized, the free base, which is enriched in (-)-eserethole, is distilled, then treated in alcohol with (-)-tartaric acid, in a 1:1 molar ratio. Thereby (-)-eserethole (-)- tartrate precipitates which is brought to a complete optical purity after one/two crystallizations, in a 18% yield. In practice, since the desired (-)-eserethole is obtain from said tartrate in a, 98-99% yield, the process according to Kobayashi allows to obtain, from 100 g of racemate, only 9 g of (-)-eserethole (apart from any recovers, involving of course even more complex procedures).Now it has been found that optically pure (-)-ese- rethole can be obtained with markedly higher yields and easier procedures from mixtures of (-)- and (+)-ese- rethole (usually from (±)-eserethole) , operating with a resolution agent amount lower than the stoichiometric amount, which amount ranges from 0.5 to 0.7 mole of resolution agent by mole of (±)-eserethole, preferably about 0.6 mole of resolution agent by mole of (±)-ese- rethole.Moreover, it has been found that the process is particularly simple compared with the known one, when operating with such resolution agents as to yield a (-)-eserethole salt less soluble than the (+)-ese- rethole one. Preferably, according to the

2. A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the resolution agent is used in an amount of 0.6 mole by mole of enantiomeric mixture.
3. A process according to claims 1 and 2, characteri¬ zed in that an acid selected from of D-(-)-tartaric, D-(+)-malic and N-benzoyl-L-glutamic acids is used as the resolution agent.
4. A process according to claims 1-3, characterized in that N-benzoyl-L-glutamic acid is used as the reso¬ lution agent.
