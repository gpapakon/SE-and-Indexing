C(B)Ar¹Ar² (wherein B represents hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy, and Ar¹ and Ar² represent each hydrogen or (un)substituted 

aryl), CAr¹Ar² (wherein Ar¹ and Ar² are each as define above), O-CHAr¹Ar² (wherein Ar¹ and Ar² are each as defined

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for 
suppressing infiltration of eosinophils comprising as an 
effective ingredient a tricyclic triazolo derivative, 
which strongly suppresses infiltration of eosinophils 
into inflammatory regions. Recently, it was found that eosinophils play an 
important role in passing allergic diseases such as 
bronchial asthma into chronic state. For example, in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained several 
hours after asthma fit caused by having a patient inhale 
an antigen, increase in the number of eosinophils is 
observed. It is suggested that eosinophils play an 
important role in damaging tissues because of having 
histotoxic proteins such as major basic protein (MBP) and 
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in granules [SAISHIN 
IGAKU, Vol. 45, No. 3, SAISHIN IGAKUSHA]. Therefore, it 
is expected that a compound which suppresses infiltration 
of eosinophils has therapeutic effect against allergic 
diseases such as bronchial asthma. A novel and useful eosinophil infiltration 
suppressor is expected to have therapeutic effect against 
allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma, and is 
demanded.  An object of the present invention is to provide an 
eosinophil infiltration suppressor which is also useful 
as an anti-inflammatory agent or anti-allergic agent. That is, the present invention provides an agent for 
suppressing infiltration of eosinophils comprising as an 
effective ingredient a tricyclic triazolo derivative of 
the formula (I): 
[wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, C₃ - C₅ 
cycloalkyl or substituted or non-substituted aryl; R² and 
R³ independently represent hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower 
alkoxy or halogen; W represents C=O or CR⁴R⁵ (wherein R⁴ 
and R⁵ independently represent hydrogen or lower alkyl); 
A represents C₁ - C₅ straight or branched saturated or 
unsaturated alkylene (with the proviso that it may 
contain one or more hetero atoms); 1 represents 0 to 2, n 
represents 1 to 3, ... represents single bond or 
double bond; Y represents N or C; Z represents C(B)Ar¹Ar² 
(wherein B represents hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy, Ar¹ 
and Ar² independently represent hydrogen or substituted 
or non-substituted aryl), CAr¹Ar² (wherein Ar¹ and Ar²  
 
represent the same meanings as mentioned above), 
O-CHAr¹Ar² (wherein Ar¹ and Ar² represent the same 
meanings as mentioned above) or a condensed aromatic 
ring]
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. As is apparent from the examples described below,
