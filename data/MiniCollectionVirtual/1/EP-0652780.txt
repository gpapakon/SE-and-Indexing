<ABSTRACT>
An automatic means and method for preventing and/or treating hypotension in hemodialysis patients. To this end, a system is provided wherein the patient or healthcare practitioner can cause the hemodialysis machine to automatically deliver sodium to the patient through the dialysate so as to increase blood and extracellular osmolarity, increase blood volume from vascular refilling, and raise blood pressure. This would thereby alleviate any clinical symptoms caused by hypotension during hemodialysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
hemodialysis apparatus with means for increasing the sodium concentration 
of dialysate at the dialysis membrane of the apparatus. Dialysis provides a method for supplementing or 
replacing renal function in certain patients. Dialysis 
is the process of separating elements in a solution by 
diffusion across a semipermeable membrane (diffusive 
solute transport) down a concentration gradient. 
Principally, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are 
utilized. Although dialysis provides in many cases life 
saving therapy, there are health issues that must be 
addressed in such patients. In a typical hemodialysis system, blood is removed 
from the patient and pumped to a dialysis machine 
including a membrane unit. The membrane unit dialyzes 
the blood which is then returned to the patient through 
tubing. Hemodialysis machines may be used at a health 
facility or in the patient's home. The machine attaches 
the patient through an extracorporeal circuit of blood 
tubing to a dialyzer having a pair of chambers separated 
by a thin semi-permeable membrane. The patient's blood 
is circulated through one of the chambers. The 
hemodialysis machine maintains a constant flow of a 
dialysate through the second chamber. Excess water from 
the blood is removed by ultrafiltration through the 
membrane and carried out by the dialysate to drain.  
 A typical hemodialysis machine provides a pair of 
hoses which connect to the dialyzer and includes a source 
of incoming water, a heat exchanger and heater for 
bringing the water to a required temperature, a source 
of a dialysate concentrate or concentrates which are 
introduced into the water in a predetermined 
concentration and necessary pumps, pressure regulators, 
a deaerator, flow controllers and regulators. In an 
acetate dialysis system, only one concentrate is 
utilized, while in the more common bicarbonate dialysis 
systems, two concentrates, acid and bicarbonate are 
utilized. The dialysate delivery system mixes water, generally 
purified by reverse osmosis or deionization, with an 
electrolyte concentration so that it approximates the 
chemical composition of ECF, warms the dialysate to body 
temperature, and checks the conductivity to ensure it is 
isotonic to the patient's blood. A number of 
commercially available machines are used to administer 
hemodialysis. Two such systems include the SPS 550 
Delivery System and SPS 1550 Delivery System marketed by 
Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois. Membrane units

<CLAIMS>
A hemodialysis apparatus comprising a dialysate source, a sodium 
source, a dialysis membrane connected in fluid communication with each 

source, and a control means operatively connected with the sodium source 
for initiating delivery of sodium from the sodium source to the dialysate 

to increase the sodium concentration in the dialysate at the membrane,
 
   characterised by a manually actuable means (12) connected with the 

control means, the control means being responsive to a signal generated 
by manual actuation of said manually actuable means (12) for initiating 

said delivery of sodium. 
The hemodialysis apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the manually 
actuable means includes a button (20), the signal being generated by 

actuating the button. 
The hemodialysis apparatus of Claim 2, wherein the apparatus is 
housed in a housing and the manually actuable means includes a cable (18) 

extending from the housing and having the button (20) at the distal end 
thereof. 
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein the control means 
includes hardware for increasing the sodium added to the dialysate. 
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein the control means 
includes software for controlling the maximum number of deliveries to the 

dialysate and the delivery interval, to prevent sodium overdosing. 
The haemodialysis apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein the 
control means is operable to adjust the concentration of sodium delivered  

 
over a predetermined period of time. 
The haemodialysis apparatus of any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein 
the control means is operable to deliver predetermined concentration of 

sodium in response to the signal by adjusting a length of time over which 
the sodium is delivered. 
The haemodialysis apparatus of any one of Claims 1 to 5 including 
means for insuring that a concentration of sodium to be delivered and a 

length of time over which the sodium is delivered are fixed. 
The haemodialysis apparatus of any preceding claim including a 
dual variable proportioning pump. 
The haemodialysis apparatus of any preceding claim including 
means for restricting sodium delivery to a predetermined number of 

milliequivalents thereof. 
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein the control means 
includes means for storing a patient's standard dialyser clearance at a 

given blood and dialysate flow rate and the patient's sodium concentration 
and blood flow; means for calculating the mass transfer area coefficient 

for the dialyser, and means for automatically determining the total number 

of milliequivalents of sodium that will be required by the patient to 
prevent hypotension.
