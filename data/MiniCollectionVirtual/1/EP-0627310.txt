<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a folding apparatus and a method for the cross-folding of products, preferably printed copies, separated from a web, especially from a longitudinally cut part web by means of a longitudinal cutting device, with at least one cross-folding device which has a folding-blade cylinder and a folding-flap cylinder. Provision is made for the folding-flap cylinder (14) to possess at least one folding flap (27) which is designed as a multiple flap (26) and which has a plurality of mutually adjacent clamping jaws (36, 37) for the purpose of holding a plurality of products (38, 38') so as to bring them together, at the same time as the cross-folding is carried out.

<CLAIMS>
Folder for the transverse folding of products,
preferably printed copies, separated from a web, in

particular by means of a longitudinal cutting device from
a longitudinally cut partial web, having at least one

transverse folding device which has a folding blade
cylinder and a folding jaw cylinder, characterized in

that the folding jaw cylinder (14) has at least one
folding jaw (27) which is designed as a double jaw (32)

and has a common, fixed clamping jaw for the collating
holding of two products (38, 38') taking place simultaneously

during the transverse folding.
Folder according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a plurality of folding blade cylinders (10, 11) for

separate webs (24, 25) in each case are assigned to the
folding jaw cylinder (14).
Folder according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the folding blade cylinders (10, 11) have holding

devices, in particular point-hole devices or grippers,
for the products (38, 38').
Folder according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a plurality of gripper cylinders (15, 16) for the

selectively possible feeding of the products (38, 38') to
different delivery paths (17, 18) are assigned to the

folding jaw cylinder (14).
Folder according to Claim 4, characterized in
that at least one of the gripper cylinders (15, 16) has

a folding blade arrangement (44) which interacts with the
folding jaw cylinder (14).
Folder according to Claim 4, characterized in
that at least one of the delivery paths (17, 18) is 

assigned a longitudinal folding device (19, 20).
Folder according to Claim 4, characterized in
that at least one of the gripper cylinders (15, 16) has

grippers (42, 43) which are designed in such a way that
they only interact with one, in particular leading - seen

in the direction of rotation of the folding jaw cylinder
- clamping jaw (36) or some of the clamping jaws of the

multiple jaw (26).
Folder according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the multiple jaw (26) is designed as a double

folding jaw (32).
Folder according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the double folding jaw (32) has a clamping web (33)

which is fixed to the cylinder and by means of whose
front and rear side (34, 35) a clamping jaw (36, 37)

interacts in each case.
Method for the transverse folding of products,
preferably printed copies, separated from a web, in

particular from a partial web cut longitudinally by means
of a longitudinal cutting device, the products being

acted upon for transverse folding by a folding blade of
a folding blade cylinder and a transfer taking place from

the folding blade cylinder to a folding jaw cylinder, the
folding jaws of which fold and hold the product in the

folding region, characterized in that the configuration
of at least one folding jaw (27) as a double jaw (32)

having a common, fixed clamping jaw enables two products
(38, 38') to be collated and held on the folding jaw

cylinder (14) in such a way that they are separate from
one another, lying adjacently one above the other.
