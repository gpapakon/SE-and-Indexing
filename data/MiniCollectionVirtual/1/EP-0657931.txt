<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of connecting leads, each consisting of an 
internal lead and an external lead, are provided so as to 

extend inward from a lead frame main body, and are then cut off 
the lead frame main body. The connecting leads are electrically 

connected with an aluminum electrode of the semiconductor 
chip. A plurality of fixing leads, each having a distal end 

bent toward the semiconductor, are provided so as to extend 
inward from the lead frame main body and thereafter are cut off 

the lead frame main body. The semiconductor chip is clamped by 
the distal ends of the fixing leads. The semiconductor chip, 

the plural connecting leads and the plural fixing leads are 

sealed together into a resin package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device 
comprising molding a semiconductor chip with 
resin. Advances of electronic components in size and thickness 
reduction technologies in the past few years have made it 
possible to provide electronic components having highly 
improved performances, specifically in the field of 
semiconductor devices such as memories. This tendency will 
lead to the need of developing semiconductor devices which are 
compact in size, thin in thickness, low in cost, reliable in 
performance, and suitable for high-density packaging. The package of semiconductor devices, used to be made of 
ceramic, are being rapidly changed to the resin type to realize 
the above requirements. Among them, surface mounting type resin 
molding packages have been increasing their demands since they 
are advantageous in providing higher mounting density compared 
with their competitive insertion type packages. The surface 
mounting type semiconductor packages are generally classified 
into some specific groups, such as QFP, SOP and SOJ, depending 
on their detailed constructions. A semiconductor device having an SOP-type resin package  
 
will be explained hereinafter as a first conventional 
semiconductor device with reference to Fig. 21. Fig. 21 is a cross-sectional view showing the first 
conventional semiconductor device. In Fig. 21, a reference 
numeral 21 represents a semiconductor chip, a reference numeral 
22 represents a resin package, a reference numeral 23 represents 
a connecting lead made of 42 alloy or copper, a reference 
numeral 25 represents an aluminum electrode, a reference 
numeral 26 represents a bonding wire made of Au, a reference 
numeral 27 represents a die pad, and a reference numeral 28 
represents a die bonding paste such as Ag paste. The semiconductor chip 21 is fixed to the die pad 27 by 
means of the die bonding paste 28. An internal lead 23a of the 
connecting lead 23 is applied a thin coating of Ag or the like. 
The aluminum electrode 25 of the semiconductor chip 21 is 
connected to the internal lead 23a of the connecting lead 23 
via the bonding wire 26. The package resin 22 seals the 
semiconductor chip 21, the bonding wire 26, the die pad 27 and 
the internal lead 23a therein. An external lead 23b of the 
connecting lead 23 extends out of the package 22. In the field of general purpose memory devices, an outer 
configuration of the package, having a small size regulated by 
the industrial standards such as JEDEC and EIAJ,

A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising: 

a first step of providing a lead frame having: 

a lead frame main body (15); 
a plurality of connecting leads (3) extending inward from said lead frame main body 
for electrical connection; and 
at least one pair of fixing leads (4) for holding a semiconductor chip (1), each of said 
fixing leads being composed of a main portion extending inward from said lead frame 

main body (15) and a distal end (4a) bent with respect to said main portion, 
the fixing leads of one pair confronting each other, the distal ends (4a) of the 

confronting fixing leads (4) having a clearance that is slightly smaller than a 
corresponding size of said semiconductor chip (1);
