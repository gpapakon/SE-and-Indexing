<ABSTRACT>
A sensor (32) and method is provided for measuring one or more select components of a material (18). The method measures the components by emitting electromagnetic radiation (42) at the material (18) and detecting the intensity of the emerging radiation at the material at separate locations (36, 37) from the source (38). The sensor (32) provides a radiation source (38) for emitting radiation (42) at a sheet (18), a plurality of detecting means (70-73, 82, 83, 90, 91, 98, 99), wherein the detecting means are offset from the source (38) substantially the same or unequally, for detecting radiation (42) after interaction with the sheet (18) and first and second reflectors (28, 30) for directing the radiation for multiple interactions with the sheet (18) when moving from the source aperture (34) to the detecting means. The invention can accurately measure the select components (e.g., moisture) of different grades of paper by eliminating the effects of the scattering power and determining absorption power at each band of the spectrum considered necessary for a particular measurement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of sensors
and methods for measuring one or more select
components of a material. In particular, the
invention relates to measuring the components by
emitting electromagnetic radiation at the material
and detecting the amount of emerging radiation at
separate locations. The invention can accurately
measure the components (e.g., moisture) of different
grades of paper by eliminating the effects of the
scattering power and determining absorption power at
each band of the spectrum necessary for the
particular measurement.Because paper is produced in a sheet from an
aqueous suspension, which includes wood pulp fibers,
cotton fibers and various chemicals, it initially
contains a considerable amount of moisture. Most of
this moisture is removed during paper production.
However, for a variety of reasons, it is often
desirable to include at least some moisture in the
paper. For example, if the paper is too dry, it will
tend to curl at the edges or may increase the cost of
production.A paper sheet is typically dried by passing it
around heated drying drums. However, this tends to
dry the sheet unevenly across its cross-direction
width, producing paper of uneven quality. Devices
have been developed to selectively moisten or dry the
cross-directional sections of the sheet. U.S. Pat.
No. 5,020,469 to Boissevain et al., assigned to
Measurex Corporation, describes such a device. 
Typically, the moistening or drying occurs after the
sheet has passed around the drying drums. Of course,
the paper mill operator, or the paper mill's process
control computer, must determine the cross-directional
moisture profile of the sheet before
these devices can be used effectively. Thus,
moisture sensors have been developed to measure the
cross-directional moisture profile.Water absorbs electromagnetic radiation across
the infrared spectrum as a function of wavelength.
Some moisture sensors take advantage of this
phenomenon by emitting infrared radiation at the
sheet and detecting the amount of the radiation
passing through or reflected from the sheet at or
near the water absorption peak. The more moisture in
the sheet, the less radiation at or near the water
absorption peak that will pass through or be
reflected from the sheet.An infrared moisture sensor can be set up with
an infrared radiation source located on one side of
the sheet and two detectors on the opposite side.
Each detector has an associated band pass filter
positioned between the source and the detector so
that the detector only
