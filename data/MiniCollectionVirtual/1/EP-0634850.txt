<ABSTRACT>
Converting a parallelised time division multiplex data stream (DIPM) into individual serial data streams (DOSS1, DOSS2,...DOSSn) and conversely. The multiplexed data stream is demultiplexed and then the individual data streams are serialised. The same thing occurs correspondingly in the reverse order in the opposite direction. Use of a dual-port RAM, which is loaded and read in such a manner that both the demultiplexing and the parallel/serial conversion (or conversely) takes place during this process. Implementation by "application-specific RAM" which requires the least possible space (approx. 20% of that with a conventional solution).
