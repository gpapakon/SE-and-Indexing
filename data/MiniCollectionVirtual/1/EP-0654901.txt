<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for the generation of an
estimated time variant signal for suppression of a primary signal,
comprising:
means for generating at least one reference signal;a control unit at least provided with a digital filter, a
first input for receiving the reference signal, a second input for
receiving an update signal for updating coefficients of the digital
filter and an output for providing a cancellation control signal;cancellation-generating means which are connected to the
output of the control unit for the generation of a cancellation
signal, which is intended, after propagation along a secondary
transfer path having a secondary path transfer function, to be
added as the estimated time variant signal at an addition point to
the primary signal in order to provide a residual signal,sensor means for measuring the residual signal at the addition
point and for providing an error signal;update means provided with an input which is connected to
the sensor means and an output for providing the update signal,an adaptation unit which has an input for receiving the at
least one reference signal and an output for providing a filtered-x
signal, which output is connected to a further input of the update
means;the adaptation unit has a transfer function which is the
same as the transfer function of the secondary path.Such a system is known from WO-A-93/15501. The adaptation
unit disclosed in this prior art document can be loaded with different
sets of weighting characteristics depending on the frequency
of the reference signal received.A similar system, but without the adaptation unit disclosed
by WO-A-93/15501, is disclosed in US Patent 4 878 188.The system as disclosed by US patent 4 878 188 can be used, inter alia, to cancel out irritant
noise (the primary signal) from a rotary machine and comprises
means for generating a reference signal, which means, for example,
comprise a tachometer of a rotary machine or an optical sensor for
measuring the speed of revolution of the rotary machine. In addition,
the known system comprises a signal processor for generating
a cancellation control signal, which is supplied to cancellation
signal-generating means for generating a cancellation signal, which
as far as possible has to cancel out the primary signal within a
specific area. The residual signal in that area is measured using
suitable sensor means, the output signal from which is fed to
update means. Said latter means produce an update signal for the
signal-processing means in order to update the
