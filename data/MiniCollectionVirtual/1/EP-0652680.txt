<DESCRIPTION>
This application contains subject matter which is 
related to co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/955,591, entitled "Method and Apparatus for 
Communication Control in a Radiotelephone System," filed 
on October 2, 1992, to co-pending U.S. Patent Application 
Serial No 07/956,640, entitled "Digital Control 
Channel," filed on October 5, 1992, and to co-pending 
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/047,452, entitled 
"Layer 2 Protocol for the Random Access Channel and the 
Access Response Channel," filed on April 19, 1993. These 
three co-pending applications are incorporated herein by 
reference.  The present invention relates to wireless 
communication systems, and more particularly, to a method 
and apparatus for communicating information in wireless 
communications systems including, for example, a cellular 
radio system. Cellular mobile telephony is one of the fastest 
growing segments in the worldwide telecommunications 
market. Between 1984 and 1992, for example, the number 
of mobile telephone subscribers in the United States grew 
from around 25,000 to over 10 million. It is estimated 
that the number of subscribers will rise to nearly 22 
million by year end 1995 and to 90 million by the year 
2000. Cellular telephone service operates much like the 
fixed, wireline telephone service in homes and offices, 
except that radio frequencies rather than telephone wires 
are used to connect telephone calls to and from the 
mobile subscribers. Each mobile subscriber is assigned 
a private (10 digit) directory telephone number and is 
billed based on the amount of "airtime" he or she spends 
talking on the cellular telephone each month. Many of 
the service features available to landline telephone 
users, e.g., call waiting, call forwarding, three-way 
calling, etc., are also generally available to mobile 
subscribers.  In the United States, cellular licenses are awarded 
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) pursuant 
to a licensing scheme which divides the country into 
geographic service markets defined according to the 1980 
Census. Only two cellular licenses are awarded for each 
market. The two cellular systems in each market are 
commonly referred to as the "A" system and "B" system, 
respectively. Each of the two systems is allocated a 
different frequency block in the 800 MHz band (called the 
A-band and B-band, respectively). To date, the FCC has 
released a total of 50 Mhz for cellular services (25 MHz 
per system). Mobile subscribers have the freedom to subscribe to
