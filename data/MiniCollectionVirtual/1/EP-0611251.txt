<ABSTRACT>
The method described here for cooling the barrel (10) of an extruder consists in causing a longitudinal flow of cooling air around the cylinder and over the length of each heating/cooling zone. Specially developed cooling plates (22; 25) make it possible to facilitate this longitudinal flow. An extruder cooled according to this method and equipped with such cooling plates wil have enhanced performance in so far as the temperature over a transverse section will be more uniform; furthermore, wear of the screw and of the barrel will be greatly reduced.

Method of air-cooling a cylinder (10) of an extruder (1), the length of 
said cylinder having at least one heating/cooling zone,
 
   characterised in that 


for each heating/cooling zone, air-delivery means (20) inject the 
cool air at least one point of entry on the interior of an enclosure (21) surrounding 

said heating/cooling zone, the air being then directed so as to distribute 
itself over the periphery of the cylinder then to flow substantially longitudinally 

along said zone to be exhausted at at least one point of exit (24) from the said 
enclosure. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the cooling air is 
distributed in two opposite directions, flowing substantially longitudinally from a 

point of entry disposed near the bottom of the enclosure, approximately midway 
along the heating/cooling zone, toward two points of exit disposed near the bottom 

of the enclosure, approximately at the two ends of said zone. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the cooling air 
flows in a single direction from a point of entry disposed near the bottom of the 

enclosure, near one end of the heating/cooling zone, toward a point of exit 
disposed near the bottom of the enclosure, approximately at the other end of 

said zone. 
Device for air-cooling a cylinder (10) of an extruder (1), the length of 
said cylinder having at least one heating/cooling zone, for application of the 

method according to claim 1,
 
   characterised in that it comprises: 


at least one air-delivery means (20) connected to at least one point of 
entry of an enclosure (21) surrounding the cylinder, 
means of guiding (21A) the stream of air within said enclosure, disposed 
so as to distribute the stream of air around the cylinder then cause it to flow 

substantially longitudinally along said zone,  
 
heat-exchange means (22; 25) disposed on the periphery of said 
cylinder, 
at least one point of exit of air (24). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that it comprises an air-delivery 
means (20) connected to a point of entry of the enclosure, said point of 

entry being disposed near the bottom of the enclosure, approximately midway 
along the heating/cooling zone, and two points of exit of air (24) disposed near 

the bottom of the enclosure, approximately at the two ends of said zone, the 
guide means (21A) being disposed in such a way that the stream of air is 

divided into two streams of opposite directions. 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that it comprises an air-delivery 
means (20) connected to a point of entry of the enclosure, said point of 

entry being disposed near the bottom of the enclosure, near one end of the 
heating/cooling zone, and a point of exit of air (24) disposed near the bottom of 

the enclosure, near the other end of said zone, the guide means (21A) being 
disposed in such a way that the flow of air establishes itself in a single stream. 
Device according to one of the claims 4 to 6, characterised in that the 
heat exchange means are constituted by a plurality of relatively thin cooling 

fins (25) of substantially parallelepiped shape, said fins being disposed side by 
side and radially over the periphery of a portion of said cylinder (10), in contact 

with said cylinder by a contact part (25C) formed by the thickness of said fin, an 
air-guiding space of substantially triangular shape being created between each 

fin. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that each 
heating/cooling zone comprises more than one group of said pluralities of fins, said 

groups being aligned according to the longitudinal direction of the cylinder. 
Device according to one of the claims 7 or 8, characterised in that 
each fin has means (25A, 25B) for placement and fastening of a heating sleeve 

(30).  
 
Device according to one of the claims 7 to 9, characterised in that 
the contact part (25C) of each fin is shaped so as to increase the heat exchange 

between the cylinder and said fin. 
Extruder (1) equipped with at least one device according to one of 
the claims 4 to 10.
