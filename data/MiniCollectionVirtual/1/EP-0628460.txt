<ABSTRACT>
A flow control valve assembly which shows high 
liquid-tightness and good flow controllability even if a 

high-pressure, low-viscosity fluid is used. It has a 
housing (1) formed with an inlet port (2) and an outlet port (3), and a 

spool (4) inserted in the housing. First and second fluid 
chambers (5,6) for applying fluid pressures on both ends of the 

spool communicate with each other through a fluid passage (8) 
having an orifice (7). The opening of the valve portion is 

adjusted by the movement of the spool so that the spool 
driving force produced by the difference in the pressures 

applied to both ends of the spool balances with the force 
of a biasing means (10), whereby a fluid flows through the 

orifice at a controlled rate. This control valve assembly 
has an elastic annular seal (11). When the spool moves toward 

the annular seal, the land portion on the spool outer 
periphery is adapted to butt the seal, thereby closing the 

fluid passage. In this closed state, fluid leakage is 
reduced substantially to zero. Also, it is possible to 

control the fluid flow even while the flow rate is very 
low.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a changeover valve adapted 
for use in a hydraulic system, such as an automotive brake 
system, which is required to delicately control the flow of 
high-pressure, low-viscosity hydraulic fluid within a wide 
range of flow rate, and a flow control valve assembly 
including the changeover valve. Fig. 4 shows a conventional flow control valve 
assembly having a housing 1 formed with an inlet port 2 and 
an outlet port 3, and a spool 4 substantially liquid-tightly 
and slidably mounted in the housing 1. A first 
fluid chamber 5 and a second fluid chamber 6 which exert 
fluid pressure on both ends of the spool 4 communicate with 
each other through a fluid passage 8 having an orifice 7. 
A valve portion 9 is formed by a land portion formed on the 
inner surface of the housing 1 and a land portion formed on 
the outer surface of the spool which are brought into 
opposed position to each other. The fluid passage in the 
valve is opened and closed by the valve portion 9. The 
spool is biased by a biasing means 10. Thus, the 
controlled flow rate in the valve depends upon the biasing 
force of the biasing means 10. In this control valve assembly, the spool 4 is biased  
 
by the biasing means 10 in a direction opposite to the 
direction of force applied to the spool by the pressure 
difference between the first and second fluid chambers 5 
and 6. The spool 4 tends to move toward a point at which 
the pressures on both ends thereof balance with each other. 
Thus, the degree of opening of the valve portion 9 is 
automatically adjusted so that the above-mentioned pressure 
difference balances with the force of the biasing means 10. 
As a result, hydraulic fluid flows through the second fluid 
chamber 6 to the outlet port 3 at a rate determined by the 
pressure difference and the sectional area of the orifice 
7. If more accurate fluid flow control is desired, as 
shown in Fig. 5, the valve portion 9 may be formed by an 
elastic annular seal 11 provided around the outer periphery 
of the spool and a shoulder formed on the outer periphery 
of the spool and adapted to be brought into contact with 
the seal 11. This arrangement is disclosed in Unexamined 
Japanese Patent Publication 3-223578 and EP-A-0 434 092 filed by the applicant 
of the present invention. One problem with the flow control valve assembly of 
Fig. 4 is that a certain degree of fluid leakage is 
inevitable because some degree of gap is inevitably formed 
between the land portion on the housing inner surface and 
the land
