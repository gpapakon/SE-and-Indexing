<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide emulsion comprises silver halide 
grains, which are dispersed in a dispersing medium. At 

least 60 % of the silver halide grains based on projected 
area of the grains are specific tabular grains having an 

aspect ratio (diameter per thickness) of not less than 2. 
The specific tabular silver halide grains have a chloride 

content in the range of 20 to 99.99 mol %. The specific 
silver halide grains further have {100} major faces. The 

specific grains furthermore have a thickness of not more 
than 0.35 µm. According to the present invention, twinned 

crystal grains contained in the emulsion comprise not more 
than 10 % of the specific tabular silver halide grains 

based on projected area of the grains. Further, the specific 
tabular silver halide grains are formed from grain 

nuclei. The nuclei have at least one gap interface of 
halide composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide emulsion
useful in photography. In more detail, the invention
relates to a silver halide emulsion containing tabular silver
halide grains that have {100} major faces.Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 51(1976)-88017,
Japanese Patent No. 64(1989)-8323 and European
Patent Publication No. 0534395A1 disclose silver halide
emulsions containing tabular silver halide grains that have
{100} major faces. European Patent Publication No.
0534395A1 further discloses high chloride tabular grains,
which are shown in photographs of Figures 1 to 5.
Referring to the Figures, twinned crystal grains are remarkably
observed in the photographs. Further, the grains
shown in the photographs have a relatively broad grain size
distribution. The Figure 1, which represents statistically
reliable number of the grains is now described in more detail.Referring to the grains shown in the Figure 1, the ratio
of twinned crystal grains to tabular grains having an
aspect ratio of not less than 2 is about 11 % based on projected
areas of the grains. Further, the grain size distribution
of tabular grains having a thickness of not more
than 35 µm is relatively broad. The grain size distribution
of relatively large tabular grains is particularly
broad, which affects the photographic property of the
grains. In more detail, the relatively large grains have a
distribution coefficient of more than 0.12, in which the 
relatively large grain comprises 70 % of the tabular silver
halide grains based on projected areas of the grains.
Further, the amount of tabular silver halide grains having
a square projected shape is relatively small. In more detail,
about 40 % of the tabular silver halide grains have a
square projected shape that a ratio of a long side to a
short side is not more than 1.4.According to study of the present inventor, the above-mentioned
characteristics about the grains shown in Figure
1 of European Patent Publication No. 0534395A1 degrade sensitivity
and image quality of a silver halide photographic
material.Further, Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No.
63(1988)-271335 discloses a silver halide emulsion containing
the above-described tabular grains and needle-like
grains.An object of the present invention is to provide a
silver halide emulsion containing silver chloride, which is
improved in sensitivity and image quality.The present invention provides a silver halide emulsion
comprising silver halide grains, which are dispersed
in a dispersing medium,
wherein at least
