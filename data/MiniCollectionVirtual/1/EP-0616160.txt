<ABSTRACT>
An all plastic (preferably fluorocarbon) 
automotive hose has great strength relative to the 

light weight thereof. The hose (10) is made of an 
inner layer (14) which has preferably circumferential 

grooves (18) on an outer wall and an electrically 
conductive surface (12) on an inner wall. An outer 

jacket (16) is extruded over the outer wall with the 
jacket material filling all grooves to provide a 

mechanical interlocking between the inner layer and the 
jacket. The cross section of the grooves is selected 

on a basis of the amount of mechanical movement desired 
between the inner layer and jacket. Some grooves 

provide uniform flexibility, some provide progressively 
greater resistance to bending, and some provide a 

differential resistance to pending -- more resistance 
in one direction than in another direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tubes and hoses with controlled 
flexibility, especially -- but not exclusively -- for use in 
the automotive industry, and more particularly to lightweight 
tubes and hoses which are highly resistant to chemical 
degradation or an electrical charge accumulation. Reference is made to U.S. Patent No. 3,166,688 for a 
description of polytetrafluoroethylene having electrical 
conductive characteristics, which is especially useful in 
draining away static electrical charges. The teachings of this 
patent may be used in the inventive hose, although many 
different fluorocarbon plastic materials may be used. Hoses of the described type are subject to degradation 
from the chemicals which they convey, to an accumulation of 
electrical charges responsive to an internal fluid flow, and to 
kinking and other bending deformations. Also, on automotive 
vehicles, they often encounter vibration, swinging, and 
whipping. The invention is designed not only to overcome these 
and similar problems, but also to provide principles which have 
application to hoses used in many other areas. When problems of this type have been solved in the past by 
providing multilayer hoses, a common trouble has related to a 
difficulty in getting the various kinds of materials to bond or 
otherwise be joined together and in preventing them from 
delaminating. In a multilayer hose of the described type, the 
outer jacket could work its way off the inner or core layer 
unless the two layers are somehow constrained. These problems 
result from the chemical inertness of the materials lining the 
hoses and from the differences in the relative weights of the 
materials. Beyond these problems, a desire is to make a mechanically 
strong hose, which is as light as possible, considering the job 
which it is to do. One problem with PTFE is that it often has  
 
too little strength on a "pull" test, often less than 10-pounds 
when a "pull" strength in the order of perhaps 100-pounds is 
desired. This is important to meet Federal vehicle safety 
standards. Different hoses may require different degrees of 
flexibility or even one degree of flexibility when bent in one 
manner and other degree of flexibility when bent in another 
manner. The need for mechanical strength also requires an outer 
jacket which resists abrasion. When flexibility becomes too 
great the hose is given to kinking; therefore, another goal is 
to provide a hose which is highly flexible without 
simultaneously kinking and bending. Still another object is

<CLAIMS>
A hose comprising an elastomeric inner liner having an 
electrically conductive inner surface and a plurality of 

circumferential grooves having a selected geometry distributed 
along a length of the outer surface of said inner liner, an 

elastomeric outer jacket extruded over the outer surface of the 
inner liner, the elastomeric materials of said inner liner and 

outer jacket being formed of materials such that non-mechanical 
bonding is unlikely, the elastomeric material of said outer 

jacket flowing into said grooves in order to form a mechanical 
interlock between said inner liner and said outer jacket, the 

shape of said grooves being selected to provide a predetermined 
amount of mechanical movement between said inner layer and said 

outer jacket. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein said mechanical movement 
between said outer jacket and said inner liner is controlled by 

a cross section of said grooves being selected on a basis of 
the desired directions and freedom of movement, said cross 

section being taken from a group consisting of three sides of 
a rectangle, two sides of a triangle, a pair of spaced parallel 

lines having an acute angle at the root of the groove, a 
dovetail mortise, or two sides of a right angle triangular 

groove which is perpendicular on one side and slanting on the 
other side. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein said grooves are further 
apart near the end of the hose to provide stress relief and 

closer together away from the end in order to provide 
flexibility. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein said hose may be used in 
a possible environment of vibration, swinging or whipping 

mechanical movement, said inner liner comprising a fluorocarbon 
material having said plurality of circumferential grooves 

formed on the outer surface thereof so that said grooves form 
areas of possible kinking, and said extruded elastomeric outer 

jacket flows into said grooves to prevent said possible kinking 
while providing said mechanical interlock between said inner 

hose and said outer jacket. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein each of said inner liner, 
outer jacket, and conductive surface is made of a fluorocarbon 

material. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein the thickness of the outer 
jacket is in the range of approximately .25 mm to 1.5 mm. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein the width of said groove 
is in the range of approximately .13 mm and 1.0 mm. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein the depth of said groove 
is in the range of about .13 mm to .7 mm. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein said grooves are 
intermittent around the circumference of the hose. 
The hose of claim 1 wherein said grooves are spaced 
from each other by a distance selected to control the 

flexibility of the hose.
