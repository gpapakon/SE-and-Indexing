<ABSTRACT>
A gas barrier laminated material comprising a 
substrate, and an inorganic compound thin-film layer and a 

protective layer which are laminated in this order, 
wherein the protective layer is a layer formed by coating 

on the inorganic compound thin-film layer a coating 
composition containing a metal alkoxide or a hydrolyzate 

thereof and an isocyanate compound having two or more 
isocyanate groups, followed by heat drying, or a layer 

formed by coating on the inorganic compound thin-film 
layer a water-based coating composition containing a water-soluble 

polymer and at least one of (a) a metal alkoxide 
or a hydrolyzate thereof and (b) a tin chloride, followed 

by heat drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminated film with gas
barrier properties (a gas barrier laminated film), used in
the field of the packaging of food, pharmaceuticals and so
forth.In recent years, packaging materials used for the
packaging of food, medicines and so forth are required to
block the effects of oxygen and water vapor passing
through the packaging materials or other gases causative
of changes in quality of contents, in order to prevent
changes in quality of contents, in particular, in the case
of food, in order to prevent proteins or fats and oils
from being oxidized or undergoing denaturation and also
preserve taste or freshness, and, in the case of
pharmaceuticals required to be handled in a germless
condition, in order to prevent effective components from
undergoing changes in quality and maintain their efficacy.
Thus, such packaging materials are sought to be endowed
with gas barrier properties for shutting off these gases
(gaseous matter). Accordingly, those having been hitherto commonly
used as packaging films are gas barrier laminated films
having laminates or coatings formed of resin compositions
comprised of a polymer commonly said to have relatively
high gas barrier properties, such as polyvinyl alcohol
(hereinafter "PVA"), an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer
(EVOH) or polyvinylidene chloride resin (hereinafter
"PVDC").Metal deposited films with gas barrier properties
are also in wide use, which are formed of suitable
polymeric resin compositions (which may be comprised of a
resin not having high gas barrier properties by itself)
and metals such as aluminum or metal compounds deposited
thereon. Nowadays, inorganic compound deposited films
have been developed, which comprise a substrate comprised
of a polymeric material having a transparency and a light-transmitting
thin film such as a silicon oxide (SiOx) thin
film of silicon monoxide (SiO) or the like or a magnesium
oxide (MgO) thin film formed on the substrate by a film-forming
means such as vacuum deposition. These metal
deposited films and inorganic compound deposited films
have higher gas barrier properties than the above gas
barrier laminated films formed of polymeric resin
compositions, may undergo less deterioration in an
environment of high humidity, and hence begin to be 
commonly used as packaging films.The above gas barrier laminated films making use of
a PVA or EVOH type polymeric resin composition, however,
have so high temperature dependence and moisture
dependence that their gas barrier properties may become
poor in an
