<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to the novel use of N-acetyl glucosamine to overcome or minimize the side-effects of anti-inflammatory agents by providing for the synthesis of essential human tissue components whose formation is inhibited by the action of these drugs. A method of minimizing adverse side effects in a human being who is being treated with anti-inflammatory agents comprising feeding the human being a therapeutic amount of N-acetyl glucosamine, and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, on a periodic basis.

 METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR SUPPRESSION OF SIDE EFFECTS OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention pertains to the novel use of N- acetyl glucosamine to overcome or minimize the side-effects of anti-inflammatory agents by providing for the synthesis of essential human tissue components whose formation is inhibited by the action of these drugs.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAnti-inflammatory agents are the most widely used of medications, and include two main types: steroid and non-steroid. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed drugs and are used on a daily basis by 40 million people in North America alone. Corticosteroids are derived from the natural hormone, cortisol, which is essential for life, but whose many properties have been exploited for therapeutic pur¬ poses including its anti-inflammatory effects. Cortico¬ steroids are frequently life-saving in more severe situ¬ ations and are very effective in many diverse conditions. These include the suppression of the inflammatory response which is a common accompaniment of many human disorders, as well as suppression in humans of the immune response which is also considered to be responsible for many disorders which, among other effects, initiate inflammation.Corticosteroids inhibit most cellular processes thereby decreasing those which are harmful, but in long- term treatment - months or years - the slowing of synthetic processes results in deficiencies in many tissues. Corticosteroids inhibit protein synthesis which impairs growth and regeneration of tissues. Some of these effects can be at least partially overcome by modifications in treatment schedules and diet. 

 Both corticosteroids and NSAIDs appear to owe their anti-inflammatory action largely to the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are regulatory substances formed in tissues and which modify function of many processes in various ways. Prostaglandins play a major role in initiating the inflammatory response so suppressing the synthesis of prostaglandins can be a desired effect. However, some processes which are essen¬ tial for normal tissue function are also slowed by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.Corticosteroid treatment for many months can result in inhibition of the synthesis of vital substances thereby causing serious tissue defects. In joints, the formation of glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronate, a major constituent, is impaired. This can lead to severe damage of joints, especially large joints

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of minimizing adverse side effects in a human being who is being treated with anti-inflammatory agents characterized by feeding the human being a thera¬ peutic amount of N-acetyl glucosamine on a periodic basis.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the N- acetyl glucosamine is fed to the human being on a daily basis.
3. A method according to claim 1 wherein the human being is fed about 300 mg to about 10,000 mg of N-acetyl glucosamine per day.
4. A method according to claim 1 wherein the human being is fed about 1,000 mg to about 6,000 mg of N-acetyl glucosamine per day.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein the human being is fed about 500 mg of N-acetyl glucosamine per day.
6. A method according to claim 3 wherein the N- acetyl glucosamine is incorporated in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
7. A method according to claim 1 wherein the N- acetyl glucosamine is fed to the human being as required to restore the integrity of affected tissues in the body of the human being.
8. A method according to claim 1 wherein the anti- inflammatory agent is a corticosteroid.
9. A method according to claim 1 wherein the anti- inflammatory agent is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. 


10. A composition useful for minimizing adverse side effects in a human being who is being treated with anit- inflammatory agents comprising N-acetyl glucosamine and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
11 A composition according to claim 10 wherein the N-acetyl glucosamine is present in the amount of about 300 mg to 10,000 mg.
12. A composition according to claim 10 wherein the N-acetyl glucosamine is present in the amount of about 1,000 mg to about 6,000 mg.
13. A composition for minimizing adverse side effects in a human being who is being treated with anti-inflamma¬ tory agents comprising a therapeutic amount of N-acetyl glucosamine, and a therapeutic amount of an anti-inflamma¬ tory agent.
14. A composition according to claim 13 wherein the anti-inflammatory agent is selected from the group consist¬ ing of corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
15. A composition according to claim 14 wherein the N-acetyl glucosamine is present in the amount of about 300 mg to about 10,000 mg.
16. A composition according to claim 15 wherein the N-acetyl glucosamine is present in the range of about 1,000 mg to about 6,000 gm.
17. A composition according to claim 15 wherein the N-acetyl glucosamine is present in the amount of about 500 mg. 


18. A composition according to claim 15 wherein the N-acetyl glucosamine is associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
19. A composition useful for minimizing adverse side effects in a human being who is being treated with anti- inflammatory agents comprising N-acetyl glucosamine, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and an anti-inflamma¬ tory agent.
20. A composition useful for minimizing adverse side effects in a human being who is being treated with cortico¬ steroids comprising N-acetyl glucosamine, a pharmaceuti¬ cally acceptable carrier, and an anti-inflammatory agent.
