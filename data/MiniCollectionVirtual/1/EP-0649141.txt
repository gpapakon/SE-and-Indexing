<ABSTRACT>
In the storage case, rotation preventive projections 67 
engageable with hubs 22 provided in a tape cassette 2 and 

recessed portions 81, 82, 83 for receiving the increased 
thickness portion 23 of the tape cassette 2 are arranged in a 

cover part 61 and a casing part 62 in such a manner that the 
tape cassette can be loaded not only forwardly but also 

reversely. The recessed portion 81 in the cover part 61 is 
formed as a recessed portion necessary not only for the forward 

loading but also for the reverse loading and serves also as a 
card storage portion for storing the index card.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a case for a magnetic
tape cassette, for example a case for a
magnetic tape cassette which is used to keep an audio magnetic
tape cassette. More specifically, the invention relates to a
case comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1.Conventionally, a magnetic tape cassette (which will be
hereinafter referred to simply as a tape cassette) for use in
an audio equipment or the like includes a front opening portion
into which a magnetic head is inserted when the tape cassette
is loaded into record/reproduce apparatus or the like, and a
magnetic tape so mounted as to cross the front opening portion.
Therefore, in order to prevent dust from going into the tape
cassette through the front opening- portion as well as to
protect a magnetic tape exposed to the front opening portion
and protect the whole of the tape cassette, the tape cassette
is normally kept in such a manner that it is stored in a
plastic case for a magnetic tape cassette (which will be
hereinafter referred to simply as a storage case).Figs. 10 and 11 respectively show conventional storage
cases. Description will be given below of the storage cases
respectively shown in these figures.The storage case 1 shown in Fig. 10 includes a cover
part 11 and a casing part 12 which is connected to the cover
part 11 openably and closably. Here, the cover part 11
includes a cover side opposing wall 13 to extend along one 
surface of a tape cassette 2, and a pocket 14 which is disposed
at one end side of the cover side opposing wall 13 and into
which a front opening portion 21 of the tape cassette 2 is
inserted. As shown in Fig. 10, an index card 3 and the tape
cassette 2 can be inserted along the cover side opposing wall
13 into the pocket 14.And the casing part 12 includes a casing side opposing
wall 15 for covering the other surface of the tape cassette 2
loaded into the cover part 11, pivotally mounting portions 16
for connecting the casing side opposing wall 15 to the cover
part 11 rotatably, and a pair of rotation preventive
projections 17 respectively provided on the casing side
opposing wall 15. The pivotally mounting portions 16 can be
formed in such a manner that two shaft-like projections
fittable into bearing holes respectively formed in the two side
walls of the pocket 14 of the cover part 11 are projectingly
provided in the corresponding inside portions of the casing
part 12, whereby the cover part 11 and casing part 12 can be
connected to each other in a mutually rotatable manner.
