<ABSTRACT>
A carrier (10, 50) having an end panel construction that snaps into place during formation of the carrier and has the ability to follow the contour of adjacent curved or beveled articles (C). Tabs (40, 80) foldably connected to an end panel flap (20, 60) and adjacent dust flaps (18, 58) cause the flaps to snap into place. The dust flaps are either connected to the side panels (14) by angled fold lines (22) or comprise continuations or extensions of the side panels (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sleeve-type carrier
according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a blank for
forming same as defined in the preamble of claim 3. It
thus deals with article carriers which are adapted to
be loaded through the open ends of an interim sleeve
configuration. More particularly, it relates to an end
panel arrangement which facilitates closing the ends of
the carrier and allows the end corner portions of the
carrier to follow the contour of the packaged articles.Sleeve-type carriers are typically formed from a
blank which is delivered to a packaging machine in the
form of a collapsed sleeve. The sleeve is erected or
opened in the machine and articles are loaded through
one or both ends of the sleeve, after which the ends of
the carrier are closed. Formation of the end panels of
the carrier normally requires the end panel flaps and
the dust flaps to which the end panel flaps are glued
to be separately folded into place by separate folding
steps. While this process continues to be successfully
employed in the packaging industry, there are certain
areas which nonetheless could be improved.A sleeve-type carrier of the generic type and a
corresponding blank are disclosed in GB 2201396 A
representing the closest prior art. Due to the tabs
connecting the dust flaps with the end panel flaps
there is provided a more automatic closing operation
facilitating closing of the end panels. The end panels
of this sleeve-type carrier form right angles with the
bottom panel and with the side panels, which makes it
difficult for the corner areas of the carrier to
contact curved articles such as beverage cans and
bottles. Thus, the articles packaged are not as tightly
held in place as it would be desirable. A further example of a more automatic end closure
arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,747,487
which provides triangular webs for connecting the end
panel flaps to the dust flaps or so-called closure
flaps. The connecting webs cause the dust flaps to move
into place when the end panel flap is moved from an
open vertical position to its final closed position in
the end of the carrier. In addition, separate
triangular corner panels are provided between the side
panels and the closure flaps. The angles formed by the
corner panels with both the side panels and the closure
panels are greater than 90Â°, which enables the corner
area of the carrier to conform to a curved surface more
readily than the usual right angled corner
configuration of conventional sleeve-type carrier
designs.Although the

<CLAIMS>
A sleeve-type carrier (10) for packaging a plurality of
articles, comprising:


top (12) and bottom (26) panels connected to side panels
(14) along fold lines (28, 30) to form a sleeve

configuration;
an end panel (16) at each end of the sleeve;
each end panel (16) being comprised of dust flaps (18)
extending transversely from the side panels (14) and an

end panel flap (20), the dust flaps (18) having upper and
lower edges and a free end connecting the upper and lower

edges, the end panel flap (20) being connected by a fold
line (36) to the bottom (26) panel, the end panel flap

fold line (36) having a length less than the width of the
bottom panel;
each dust flap (18) being connected to the associated
side panel (14) along a fold line (22) extending from a

point adjacent the end of the bottom panel (26) to a
point offset from the end of the top panel (12);
the end panel flaps (20) overlying the dust flaps (18)
and being adhered thereto;
the end panel flap being connected at either side thereof
to a first portion of the lower edge of the adjacent dust

flap (18) by a tab (40), said first edge portion being
spaced from the associated side panel (14) by a second

portion of said lower edge, said second edge portion
comprising an edge of a cutout (46) extending between

said dust flap (18) and the end panel flap (20), the tab
(40) being connected to said lower first edge portion by

a first tab fold line (44) and to the end panel flap by a
second tab fold line (42), said first tab fold line (44)

being substantially parallel to the top and bottom panels
and said second tab fold line (42) extending at an angle

thereto,
 
characterized in that:
the dust flaps (18) do not contain any other fold line
than the fold lines (22; 44) connecting them to the side

panels (14) on the one hand and to the tabs (40) on the
other hand and in that the fold lines (22) connecting the

dust flaps (18) to the adjacent side panel (14) extend at
an angle to the top (12) and bottom (26) panels to enable

the dust flaps (18) to follow the contour of adjacent
articles having cylindrical portions extending at right

angles to the top and bottom panels.
A sleeve-type carrier according to claim 1, wherein the
tabs (40) are located between the end flap (20) and the

adjacent dust flap (18), each tab being folded about its
second tab fold line (42) so as to be in face-to-face

relationship with the interior face of the end panel
flap, and about its first fold line so as to be in face-to-face

relationship with the exterior face of the
associated dust flap.
A blank (24) for forming a sleeve-type carrier (10) for
packaging a plurality of articles comprising:


a bottom panel section (26) connected
by a fold line (28) to side panel sections (14) on

either side thereof and a top panel section (12)
connected by a fold line (30) to one of

the side panel sections (14), the top, bottom and side panel
sections being adapted to be folded along the fold lines

to form a sleeve configuration;
an end panel flap (20) connected to each end of the
bottom panel section (26) by a fold line (36) having a

length less than the width of the associated
bottom panel (26);
dust flaps (18) extending from each end of the side panel
sections (14) and terminating in free ends, the dust 

flaps (18) having lower edges spaced from the end panel
flaps (20);
the dust flaps (18) being connected to the associated side panel
section (14) through fold lines (22);

adjacent the end of the bottom panel section

panel section;
each end panel flap (20) being connected on either side
thereof to a first portion of the spaced edge of an

adjacent dust flap (18) by a tab (40), said first edge
portion being spaced from the associated side panel

section by a second portion of said lower edge, said
second edge portion comprising an edge of a cutout (46)

extending between said dust flap (18) and the end panel
flap (20), the tab (40) being connected to said first

spaced edge portion by a first tab fold line (44) and to

the end panel flaps (20) being adapted to overlie the
dust flaps (18) of a carrier formed from the blank,

characterized in that:
