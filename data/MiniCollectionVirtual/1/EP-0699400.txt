<ABSTRACT>
The clasp (10) of the safety belt is retained in the catch housing by a hinged retaining catch (16) whose inner end is held in the locked position by a spring-loaded slider catch (20). The coil spring (30) for the retaining catch has one end located over a short tag (35) on the hinged catch. The spring is aligned inside a guide duct formed by flanges attached to the inside of the catch housing (14). The catch is released via a release tab (24) on the side of the catch housing. The slider end of the spring has a wider-diameter section (40) which aligns centrally between the guide tags. The widened end has close spaced windings shaped into a flattened end flange.

<CLAIMS>
A seat belt buckle with a swivel latch (16) mounted in a
load bearing frame (14) and engaging in its locked position

a latching edge of an insertion tongue (10), a locking member
(20) which is shiftably mounted on the frame (14) transversely

to the swivel direction of the swivel latch (16)
between an opening position in which it releases the swivel

latch, and a locking position in which it blocks the swivel
latch in 
its engaging position, a release button (24) also
mounted on the frame, by actuation of which the locking

member (20) is shiftable into the opening position, and a
helical pressure spring (30) which by its one end is supported

by the swivel latch (16) and by its other end (40) is
supported by the locking member (20), characterized in that

the pressure spring (30) is held in a spring receptacle
which is defined by two webs (50) of the frame (14) and

which surrounds a pin (35) on the locking member (20), the
locking member end (40) of the pressure spring (30) being

configured such that the locking member end (40) of the
spring in cooperation with the webs (50) is automatically

centered on the pin (35).
The buckle as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that
the locking member end (40) of the spring is formed with a

diameter which is substantially larger than the diameter of
the working windings of the spring (30). 
The buckle as set forth in claim 2, characterized in that
the locking member end (40) of the spring is formed spirally

shaped with windings which are substantially located one on
the other.
The buckle as set forth in claim 2, characterized in that
the locking member end (40) of the spring is formed in the

shape of a ring flange.
