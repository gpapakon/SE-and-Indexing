<ABSTRACT>
Washing and cleaning agents, especially for textiles, which contain combinations of builders like zeolithe and/or crystalline laminated silicates of the general formula (I) NaMSixO2x+1.yH2O, in which M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4 and y is a number from 0 to 20, and, as complex formers, polyhydroxy bicarboxylic acids or polyhydroxy bicarboxylic acid salts with 4 to 6 carbon atoms and at least 2 hydroxy groups per molecule or mixtures of these acids and/or salts, in which the ratio by weight of builders to polyhydroxy dicarboxylic acids or polyhydroxy dicarboxylic acid salts or mixtures of these acids and/or salts is 30:1 to 1:1, exhibit better secondary washing capacity than similar agents which, instead of polyhydroxy dicarboxylic acids or polyhydroxy dicarboxylic acid salts, contain polyhydroxy tricarboxylic acids or polyhydroxy tricarboxylic acid salts like citric acid or citrate. Preferred agents contain up to 15 wt % sodium and/or potassium carbonate but no phosphonates, (co)polymeric polycarboxylates and citric acid or citrate.
