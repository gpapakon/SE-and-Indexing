<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
controlling an automatic transmission (2) of a vehicle when 

accelerating from rest, in which automatic engagement of the 
clutch (3) is actuated when the vehicle is moving on an 

incline with the clutch disengaged and a gear engaged but 
only in the case in which the direction of rotation of the 

input shaft (22) of the gearbox (5) is in conformity with 
that of the drive shaft (20); the method is carried out 

using respective sensors (19,21) associated with respective 
shafts (20,22) and able to detect the absolute value of the 

angular speed thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
controlling an automatic transmission of a vehicle, in 
particular a commercial vehicle, and to a control device 
operating according to said method. Automatic transmissions are known which comprise a 
gearbox which is associated with a fluid actuator for 
shifting and engaging the gears, a clutch provided with an 
actuator for controlling the relative engagement travel and 
a control unit adapted to generate control signals for 
respective control valves of said actuators on the basis of 
input signals corresponding to shifting operations by the 
driver and input signals which are representative of the 
operating conditions of the vehicle. With reference to these latter, in particular, for 
controlling the clutch there are generally used an angular 
speed sensor of the drive shaft and a sensor of the angular 
speed of the input shaft of the gearbox. These sensors are 
generally of electromagnetic type and are disposed opposite 
a phonic wheel secured to the respective shaft so as to 
generate a sequence of frequency pulses which are 
proportional to the speed of rotation of the wheel itself. In this way the absolute value of the speed of 
rotation of the shafts but not the direction of rotation is 
determined; the data concerning the absolute value of the 
speed is adequate in the majority of operating conditions in 
which the direction of rotation of the gearbox input shaft 
is determined univocally. However, in certain specific 
conditions, in particular when accelerating from rest on an 
incline, the control carried out in a conventional manner, 
namely based on the absolute value of the speed of rotation, 
may result in dangerous situations arising. For example, in a situation in which the vehicle is  
 
stationary and facing downhill, with the engine running and 
a gear engaged, owing to the brake pedal being actuated by 
the driver; obviously, the clutch is disengaged. If the 
driver releases the brake pedal the vehicle moves at an 
increasing speed under the action of gravity; for obvious 
safety reasons, the control unit therefore has to engage the 
clutch when the speed of the vehicle, and thus of the input 
shaft, reaches a predetermined value, so as to ensure the 
braking action of the engine. In the operating situation described it may happen 
that a reverse gear is engaged in the gearbox, for example 
following a preceding manoeuvre; in this case the gearbox 
input shaft rotates in the opposite direction to the drive 
shaft but the conventional
