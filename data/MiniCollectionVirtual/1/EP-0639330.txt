<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a method of controlling fleas which includes 
continuously administering to the haircoat of a homeothermic animal an ovicidally 

effective amount of 2-(1-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethoxy)pyridine (pyriproxifen) 
from a sustained release matrix at a rate of .1 mcg/kg/day to 100 mcg/kg/day. The 

method may also include the use of additional ingredients such as insecticides, 
plasticizers, lubricants and antioxidants in a sustained release matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of sterilizing fleas using release
compositions containing and releasing pyriproxifen, 2-[1-methyl-2-(4-phenoxy-phenoxy)ethoxy]pyridine,
and the use of such compositions for control of
ectoparasitic insects on homoiothermic or warm-blooded animals.Blood sucking ectoparasites of the class Insecta include fleas, such as
Ctenocephalides fells and Ctenocephalides canis (cat and dog fleas), as well as lice,
mosquitos, tabanids, tsetse and other biting flies and those of the class Aricana
include ticks such as Boophilus, Amblyomma, Anocentor, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis,
Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicentor, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Argas, Otobius and
Ornithodoros and mites. These ectoparasites infest or attack many useful
homoiothermic animals, including farm animals such as cattle, swine, sheep, goats,
poultry such as chickens, turkeys and geese, fur bearing animals such as mink, foxes,
chinchilla, rabbits, and pet animals such as dogs and cats.Ticks are described as hard ticks or soft ticks and are characterized as
one host, two host, or three host ticks. They attach to a suitable host animal and
feed on blood and body fluids. Engorged females detach and drop from the host and
lay large numbers of eggs (2,000 to 20,000) in a suitable niche in the ground or in
some other sheltered location in which hatching occurs. The larvae then seek hosts 
from which to obtain blood meals. Larvae of one host ticks molt on the host twice
to become nymphs and adults without leaving the host. Larvae of two and three host
ticks drop off the host, molt in the environment and find a second or third host (as
nymph or adult) on which to feed.Ticks are responsible for the transmission and propagation of many
human and animal diseases throughout the world. Ticks of major economic
importance include Boophilus, Rhipicephalus, Ixodes, Hyalomma, Amblyomma, and
Dermacentor. They are vectors of bacterial, viral, rickettsial and protozoal diseases,
and cause tick paralysis and tick toxicosis. Even a single Ixodes holocyclus tick can
cause paralysis consequent to injecting its saliva into its host in the feeding process.
Tick-borne diseases are usually transmitted by multiple-host ticks. Such diseases,
including Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis, Theileriosis and Heart Water are responsible for
the death and/or debilitation of vast numbers of pet and food animals throughout
the world. In many temperate countries, Ixodid ticks transmit the agent of a chronic,
debilitating disease, Lyme disease, from wildlife to

<CLAIMS>
A method of sterilizing fleas which comprises continuously
administering to the haircoat of a homeothermic animal an ovicidally effective

amount of 2-(1-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethoxy)pyridine (pyriproxifen) from
a sustained release matrix at a rate of 0.01 mcg/kg/day to 50 mcg/kg/day and

which optionally comprises continuously administering an insecticidally or
acaricidal effective amount of a toxicant agent.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the release rate is in the
range of 1 mcg/kg/day to 50 mcg/kg/day.
