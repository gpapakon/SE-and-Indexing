<ABSTRACT>
In a sizing press for reducing by pressure width of 
hot slabs of both a low carbon steel and a stainless 

steel, the reduction by pressure of width is performed 
quickly without replacing the dies each time. Two or more 

types of dies (1,2),(3,4) having caliber configurations for 
respectively reducing the width at least of a low carbon 

steel and a stainless steel are disposed in layers and are 
retained in a manner capable of being displaced in an up 

and down direction (22). They may be replaced as a block with 
another block of stacked dies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sizing press for 
hot rolling and to a method of changing dies in a sizing press. Having regard to a die arrangement in a sizing press 
for continuously reducing the width of hot slab by 
pressure, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.61-202705 discloses 
an arrangement in layers consisting of a pair of main 
press dies having a sloped chamfer portion toward the 
inlet side and a parallel portion extending from the 
sloped chamfer portion toward the outlet side in the 
direction along which the hot slab is conveyed. Further 
disclosed is a rear end preforming die having a sloped 
portion spread out toward the outlet side from the inlet 
side in the conveying direction of the hot slab. Considering the lifetime of the main die, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No.2-6003, for example, discloses a 3-layer 
structure including a rear-end preforming die, where 
the main dies are arranged into two layers. These  
 
techniques, however, do not consider the configuration of 
die caliber, i.e., these are the techniques basically 
premising a flat shape for the caliber configuration. Also, there is a problem in changing of a die in the 
sizing press. In a sizing press such as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.60-96301, the die for 
performing reduction in width by pressure has a relatively 
short lifetime because it is exposed to high temperature 
and high pressure. In a hot rolling mill for a steel, its 
lifetime generally ends after reducing width of about one 
hundred pieces of slab. To achieve a longer lifetime of 
such die, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.62-282738 discloses 
a method in which the thermal load is reduced by moving 
the die in an up and down direction. This is, however, 
not quite satisfactory. In a large-scale hot strip mill, 
lifetime of the die is completed in one day or so after 
which it must be changed. Change of the die in the sizing 
press must be performed during operation. Therefore, in 
addition to minimizing the time required for die change, 
there is a great desire for reducing as much as possible 
or completely eliminating, operation to be performed by 
the operator at the time of changing the die in a mill 
which is operated by the minimum number of persons.  
 Moreover, in addition to the need for change due to 
lifetime of the die as described, needs have recently 
arisen for using optimal dies according to slab section or 
steel type. It is increasingly necessary to perform more 
frequently die changes in comparison to the conventional 
requirement.

<CLAIMS>
A method of changing dies in a sizing press (30), said 
method comprising the steps of: 


extracting a block of dies (1 to 4) which are stacked in 
layers; 
substituting for the extracted block of stacked dies (1 
to 4) another block of stacked dies; and 
recognizing positions of left and right halves of 
substituted dies by means of a laser beam (6) providing a 

reference point, whereby the widthwise positions of the dies 
(1 to 4) are determined based on the reference point. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein said block of 
stacked dies (1 to 4) includes main press dies (1, 3) stacked 

in vertical direction and having at least two kinds of 
caliber configurations. 
The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein in the 
step of recognizing and determining positions of left and 

right halves of the dies the positions are determined by 
means of a width recognizing revolution meter (15) connected 

to a motor (12) of a width adjusting device. 
A sizing press of the type which reduces by pressure the 
width of hot slabs (5), said sizing press comprising: 


a die slider (21) on which main press dies of two or 
more types of caliber configurations are stacked in vertical 

direction, 
a width adjusting device (10,12,20) for adjusting the 
widthwise position of the die slider (21); 
a die changing apparatus for extracting a die slider 
(21) and exchanging the extracted die slider by another die  

 
slider on which main press dies of two or more types of 

caliber configurations are stacked in vertical direction; and 
recognizing means for recognizing the widthwise 
positions of exchanged left and right die halves, said 

recognizing means including a laser transmitter (61) and a 
laser receiver (62) arranged such that a laser beam running 

in parallel with the dies is provided. 
The sizing press of claim 4, wherein laser beams 
corresponding to the number of stages of dies stacked on the 

slider (21) are provided. 
The sizing press of claim 4 or 5, wherein said main 
press dies of two or more types of caliber configurations 

including a main press die for low carbon steel having a 
caliber so configured as to roll a slab ridge portion and 

main press die for stainless steel having a caliber so 
configured as to recess a slab side surface. 
The sizing press of claim 4, 5 or 6, further comprising 

a die cylinder (16) for driving said die slider (21) up 
and down; and 
a block (20) reciprocately movable in the widthwise 
direction of said slab (5) by being driven by a widthwise 

rolling actuator;
 
   wherein said die changing apparatus comprises: 
a lifting device (43) which, when said die slider (21) 
is exchanged with the new die slider, is adapted to lift said 

die slider (21) to a level above said sizing press (30) while 
lowering the new slider (21); 
a loading/unloading device (50) or the lifting device 
(43) which is adapted to lower the lifted die slider (21) and 

to lift said new die slider (21) at an off-line position of 
said sizing press (30); and 
a changing platform car (42) which is reciprocately 
movable between a position above said sizing press (30) and  

 
the off-line position of said sizing press (30) so as to
