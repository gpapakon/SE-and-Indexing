<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatic adjustment device for a control cable comprising an outer cable sheath (G) and an inner core (A) which can slide inside the said sheath. The core is connected at one of its ends to an actuating member (P), and at the other end to a receiving member (R) which is to be controlled remotely. The sheath is fixed at its ends to the framework, and the device includes:     - a support (1; 101a, 101b) secured to one of the members, - a cam (3; 103) intended for the fastening of one end of the core inside the cable and rotationally connected to the said support, with a slight possibility for moving in terms of rotation in the direction for pulling on the internal core of the cable, - elastic return means (4; 104) acting on the cam (3; 103) to exert a return torque tending to return the cam in rotation in the direction of pulling on the internal core of the cable, the cam (3; 103) being capable of moving in rotation against the reaction of the said elastic return means (4; 104) under the effect of a pull exerted on the internal core of the cable during adjustment for the purpose of making the travel of the two members correspond.
