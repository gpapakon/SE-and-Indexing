<ABSTRACT>
A Venetian blind for closing windows or the like comprises a plurality of horizontal slats mounted in vertically-spaced relation, a tilting device for simultaneously tilting all the slats about their horizontal axes from horizontal positions to vertical positions, a raising device and a locking device preventing the slats from being raised. The plurality of slats are mounted on head pins received within channels located at opposite sides of the opening and guiding the movement of the head pins of the slats when the slats are tilted, raised and lowered.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Descriptionof the invention having as title:ARMOURED VENET IAN BL I ND FOR WI NDOWS OR THE L I KEAt present the socalled Venetian blinds with strips that can be oriented and wrapped are useful only to regulate light and air without having any defensive force.The conceived device puts into effect for the first time a "Nenetian blind" that, together with the merit of allowing the best visibility and airing, is an effective defence.In fact, its slats, produced with steel strap of different thicknesses, are able to resist to breaking, lifting, cutting, perforation, preventing from intrusion in the premises.Mechanical device and working process. The Venetian blind, that can be applied anywhere, works with capstan control mechanisms with a flying rod and an electric engine already on the market that are inserted inside a box (Fig. 2 Ν. 1) applied at the ceiling and having on the outer face a steel veil (Fig.3 Ν. 2) covering the joint with the last slat while in the inner side it has a cap to access to the commands.On the lateral sides of the place where the Venetian blind is installed, suitable containing guides are fixed with screws (12) special guides which are made up by two parts, a fixed one and a mobile one (Fig. 4, 5) linked by a hinge (5) that on one side has a latch bolt with hooks (Fig. 7 Ν. 13) and on the other side it has plates with receiving holes for the hooks of the bolt.The guide opens when the bolt (13) is lifted and pushed towards outside by a lever inserted in its top (14) run by the commands placedut in the box (1 ), it closes when the command works in the opposite way. The fixed part of the guide (4) has two opposing fins (10) which mark the space (34) where the heads of the pins (30) are kept coupling the single slats (3). 

The mobile part of the guide (Fig. 5 N. 6) is milled to create notches (Fig. 3, 6 N. 7) used to regulate the inclination of the slats. The sections produced in the guide by the creation of the notches have holes that are closed with nylon plugs (32). The guides have two grooves (11) where nylon buffers for sealing the slats are inserted. The Venetian blind can assume three positions:A) Total closing. After the opening of the guides (Fig. 5) the slats (3) are placed vertically by the fillets (Fig. 8, 10, 11 N. 25, 27) and are blocked in this position by the closing of the guides (Fig. 2 N. 4) with the insertion of the bolts (13).B) Half closing. The opening of the guides sets the slats free allowing the commands to run the fillets (Fig. 8, 11, 13 N. 25, 27) and to

 CLAIMS
1) Device for the creation of a Venetian blind against forcing and intrusion that can be applied to windows or rooms of premises, characterized by the fact that it includes special metal slats (Fig. 8 N. 3) strenghtened inside by the various components of a steel strap (Fig. 8, 9 N. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 31); the slats (3) linked by head pins (30) to special lateral guides (Fig. 4 N. 4) that allow their anchoring, the inclination, the sliding; the slats (3), whose movements are synchronized by proper fillets (Fig. 8 N. 25, 26, 27) are provided with steel ropes (23) for their lifting. Everything is regulated by manual or electric commands that are in a box over the Venetian blind (1).
2) Slat in mould metal inside according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that its curved profile at the ends (15) with lateral grooves (16) creates a seat to contain various components for its sheating (Fig. 9) and it allows a perfect coupling between the slats (3).
3) Device according to claim N. 1, for the inner strap and the lateral closing of the slats (3), characterized by the fact that it has its components (Fig. 8 N. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 31) fit for joining between them to create a single body with the slat (3) trough head pins (30) to the lateral guides of seal. (Fig 4 N. 4).
4) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that the steel tube (21) receives and keeps in its ends the cylindrical inserts (31); in their cut screw cavity the head pins with neck (30) are screwed for the coupling of the slats (3) to the lateral guides (4).
The block of the cylinder (31) in the tube (21) takes place by means of punching or electric welding.
5) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that it has in the two ends some slats (3) or also in their body (Fig. 10 N. 33) stainless steel fillets wqith a particular shape (Fig. 8 N. 25, 26, 27) used for the synchronized movement of the slats (3) and to prevent the opening. These fillets are fixed to the slats with common screws and special pins (30) and proper spacers (28, 29).
6) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that it has two lateral steel ropes (Fig. 9 N. 23) coupled to the first inferior slat (3) for the lifting or lowering of all the slats of this device (Fig. 11, 12, 13). 


7) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that it has two lateral guides (Fig. 4 N. 4); each of them is made up by two bodies (Fig. 5 N. 4, 6) joined between them trough an hinge (5). The first body is fixed to the lateral wall with screws (12) and has an inner groove (34) marked by two opposing fins (10) for the seal of the head of the pins (30). The second body (6) is mobile and used for the regulation and the fixing of the slats (3) in the horizontal, vertical and oblique position (Fig.l, 2, 6, 11). Both bodies have a groove (11) to insert nylon buffers. 8) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that the mobile part (6) of the guide (4) has a separate cavity (7) that is partially removed with the milling to create notches (Fig. 3, 6 N. 7) that receive the slats (3) allowing the inclination according to the angulation given to these notches (7). The holes (7) produced in the guide (7) to create the notches are closed with nylon plugs (Fig. 6, 8 N. 32).
9) Device according to claim N. 1, characterized by the fact that the hinge (Fig. 5, 7 N. 5) of coupling of the two parts of the guide (4) has arranged on one side a bolt (Fig. 7 N. 13) made up by a vertical rod with various prominent hooks that go inside the corresponding holes of plates (9) welded on the other side of the hinge (5).
The bolt (13) has its proper seamy top (14) for the linking to the movement commands that are in the box (1). All the profiles and accessory pieces concerned created or applied according to any of the above mentioned claims.
