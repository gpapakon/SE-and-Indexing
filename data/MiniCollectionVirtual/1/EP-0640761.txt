<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling an ignition system for internal-combustion engines, in which invention the spark firing current and its firing period can be adjusted. The described method permits each cylinder of the engine to be supplied with that ignition energy which corresponds to the instantaneous requirement of the engine, as a result of which a spark plug changing interval of more than 100,000 km can be achieved. According to the invention, both the value of the spark firing current and its firing duration can be controlled as a function of engine parameters, in particular of load, speed and temperature. Preferably, the method according to the invention can be used in an alternating current or high voltage capacitor ignition system.

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling an ignition system for internal-combustion engines, comprising of at
least one ignition output stage (Z
1
 ... Z
4
) for actuating at least one ignition coil (Tr) which
generates a spark-burning current (I
B
), where the value of the spark-burning current (I
B
) and
its burning time (t
B
) are adjustable, 
characterised in that
 as a function of the engine
parameters engine load (L) and engine speed (N), a basic value (U
Basis
) for the spark-burning
current (I
B
) is taken from an ignition current characteristic map stored in a control unit (1) and
a basic value (t
Basis
) for the burning time (t
B
) is taken from a burning time characteristic map
likewise stored in the control unit (1), whereby these characteristic maps are configured to

reflect the energy required for sparking.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the base values (U
Basis
, t
Basis
) are corrected in
accordance with the instantaneous operating state

of the internal-combustion engine.
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 a temperature correction (U
Temp
, t
Temp
) is carried
out as a function of the instantaneous engine

temperature (T
ist
).
A method according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised
in that
 the base value (U
Basis
) for the value of the
spark burning current (i
B
) is subjected to a dynamic
correction in the event of a dynamic change in the

operating state of the internal-combustion engine.
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterised in
that
 following a change in load, the base value (U
Basis
)
increases by a dynamic factor (U
Dyn
) which is
proportional to the change in the load value (L
ist
 -
L
alt
) and reduces with time.
A method according to Claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 after a specified delay time the dynamic factor
(U
Dyn
) reaches the value zero, where the corrected
base value assumes the base value for the new

load state.
A method according to one of the preceding claims
for controlling an a.c. ignition system.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6 for controlling
a high-voltage capacitor ignition system.
