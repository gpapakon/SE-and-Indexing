<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a surgical drape comprised of an absorbent sheet (1) and a fluid-impermeable sheet (2) attached thereto. According to the invention, the fluid-impermeable sheet (2) is provided with projections (3) on that side which lies distal from the absorbent sheet (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical drape comprised 
of an absorbent sheet and a fluid-impermeable 
sheet attached thereto. Applicant retails a surgical drape under the designation 
Klinidrape速 (registered trademark), which is 
comprised of a three-sheet laminate. The laminate 
comprises a liquid-absorbent top sheet made of non-woven 
material, a fluid-impermeable intermediate sheet 
of polyethylene, and a bottom absorbent sheet of 
cellulose wadding. The purpose of the top sheet is to 
absorb blood and other fluids delivered from the 
surgical wound, so as to prevent contamination of 
theatre personnel and the operating theatre as a 
whole. The plastic film forms a barrier against the 
transportation of fluid-carried bacteria between the 
patient and the area of the surgical wound, while the 
layer of cellulose wadding on the underneath of the 
drape is intended to enhance patient comfort, by 
absorbing perspiration and preventing direct contact 
of the patient's skin with the plastic sheet. Although Klinidrape速 fulfils the requirements of a 
surgical drape in a highly satisfactory fashion, the 
drape cannot be readily arranged in folds because of 
its relatively complicated structure, and is felt to 
be less soft than those surgical drapes of textile 
material traditionally replaced by this drape. The object of the invention is to provide a surgical 
drape of simpler construction which has equally as 
good properties as or better properties than Klinidrape速, 
both with respect to the absorbency of the top 
sheet and the barrier function of and the patient 
comfort afforded by the drape, and which can be 
arranged in folds more easily than the known drape.  
 This object is achieved in accordance with the invention 
with a surgical drape of the kind defined in the 
introduction which is characterized in that the fluid-impermeable 
sheet is provided with projections on the 
side thereof which lies distal to the absorbent 
sheet. Similar to Klinidrape速, such a surgical drape 
has absolute barrier properties. Furthermore, such a 
surgical drape will provide good patient comfort, 
because only the bottoms of the projections will lie 
against the patient's skin, thereby providing good air 
circulation between the skin and the drape. According to one advantageous embodiment, the projections 
are cup-shaped. This enhances the absorbency of 
the top sheet, in that fluid delivered by the surgical 
wound will be collected and held in the cup-shaped 
cavities of the projections. According to a further
