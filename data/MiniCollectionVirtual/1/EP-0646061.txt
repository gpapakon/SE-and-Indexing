<ABSTRACT>
An inner lining for an item of equipment used at least temporarily to cover parts of the body consists of at least one layer of cut sections, of at least one textile material (2) and at least one semi-permeable membrane (1), attached together on joining lines. The individual layers are thereby assembled over their entire areas in a non-slip and semi-permeable manner. The joining lines (8a) of the membrane parts (1', 1'') are welded, while those (8b) of the parts (2', 2'') of a first textile material are joined independently of the membrane (1), preferably by sewing.

Inner lining for an item of equipment for at least temporary partial 
covering of body parts, such as an article of clothing, coverlet, or sleeping bag, 

comprising at least one layer of cut parts, joined together at connecting lines, of 
at least one textile material (2), and at least one semipermeable membrane (1), 

with the individual layers being joined together in a slip-proof and semipermeable 
manner over their entire common surface, with connecting lines (8a) of 

membrane parts (1', 1'') being welded, characterized by the connecting lines (8b) 
of parts (2', 2'') of a first textile material being joined together independently of 

membrane (1), preferably by sewing. 
Inner lining according to Claim 1 with at least two textile layers, 
with membrane layer (1) being disposed between two textile layers (2, 9), 

characterized by all layers (1, 2, 9) being joined together over their entire 
common surface in a slip-proof and semipermeable manner, and by membrane 

layer (1) having common connecting lines (8c) with a second textile material 
layer (9), said lines being welded or heat-sealed and preferably sewn as well. 
Inner lining according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized by one or 
both sides of semipermeably joined textile material layer(s) (2) and membrane 

layer (1) and at least one additional textile material layer (2a) and/or at least one 
additional semipermeable membrane layer being provided, in turn joined 

essentially over the entire surface in a slip-proof and semipermeable fashion with 
the semipermeably bonded textile material-membrane layer (1, 2), with the 

connecting lines of the parts of the additional membrane being welded, while the 
connecting lines (8b) of the other textile material (2a', 2a'') are joined together 

independently of the first and/or the additional membrane, preferably by sewing. 
Inner lining according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 characterized 
by at least two layers (1, 2) being joined together by a semipermeable or partially 

applied (especially in the form of a plurality of dots on their contact surface), 
possibly activatable, adhesie layer (4). 
Inner lining according to any one of the foregoing claims 
characterized by containing at least two textile material layers joined directly to 

one another areawise. 
Method for manufacturing an inner lining according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5 wherein at least one textile material layer (2) and at least one 

membrane layer (1) of the desired inner lining are appropriately cut and shaped 
into individual cut parts (1', 1'', 2', 2''), whereupon the two layers (1, 2) are  

 
joined together in a flush and semipermeable fashion, characterized by the fact 

that before the flush joining of inner lining layers (1, 2, 2a) independently of one 
another, membrane (1) and at least a first material (2), and possibly also another 

textile material (2a), are cut according to the desired shape, whereupon cut 
membrane parts (1', 1'') are joined only together especially by welding, and cut 

parts (2', 2'') of first material (2), and independently therefrom also parts (2a', 
2a'') of any other material (2a), are joined only together, especially by sewing. 
Method according to Claim 6 characterized by the fact that before 
cutting of membrane layer (1), the latter is joined semipermeably over its entire 

common surface with, a second textile material layer (9), whereupon these two 
layers (5b) are cut jointly and cut parts (5b', 5b''), corresponding to the shape of 

the inner lining are joined together, especially by sewing, and welded or heat-sealed 
to one another at the seams. 
Method according to Claim 6 characterized by the additional 
textile material (2a) being cut to match first textile material (2) mirror-image-wise. 
Method according to Claim 7 characterized by first textile material 
(2) being cut to match the layer composed of membrane (1) and second textile 

material (9) mirror-image-wise. 
Item of equipment, especially a glove with an inner lining 
according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized by the inner lining being joined 

to the inside of the item of equipment over its entire surface in a semipermeable 
and slip-proof manner, especially by gluing.
