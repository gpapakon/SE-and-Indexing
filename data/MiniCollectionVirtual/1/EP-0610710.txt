<ABSTRACT>
In installation apparatuses, in order to provide clip-on attachment to mounting rails (1), devices with locking slides (2) are known which are also provided with support points (9) for screw-in attachment. The device according to the invention is improved in particular with respect to the mounting and removal of an individual apparatus which is operated in conjunction with further apparatuses and a common busbar. Releasing the individual device from the assembly is achieved in that the locking slides (2) can be lowered out of the position for snap-in attachment into the position for screw-in attachment using guide means (4, 5) so that a planar base surface is produced which permits apparatuses to be displaced as desired on the mounting rail (1) and thus to be replaced without difficulty.

Device for the detachable fixing of electrical 
installation devices to mounting rails (1), in 

particular top-hat rails having at least a first U-shaped 
stop slide (2) which can be snapped on to the 

mounting rail (1), which can be adjusted at the 
underside of the housing of insulating material (3), 

surrounding the underside, between two stop-slide 
positions by way of guide means (4, 5) and which is 

supported by spring power, whereby in the first stop-slide 
position the device, forming an indentation (6) 

with the stop slide (2), can be snapped at the 
underside on to the mounting rail (1), and in the 

second stop-slide position, which can be achieved by a 
lowering movement of the stop slide (2) sloping to the 

outside and in which the base plane (7) of the 
indentation (6) is extended to the outside, the stop 

slide (2) has a screw hole (9) in an area (8) 
projecting beyond the outer surface of the device. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that opposite the first stop slide (2) there is a 

second stop slide (2) which can be lowered, the 
structure and mounting of which are the same as those 

of the first. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that as guide means grooves (5) are 

provided in the stop slide (2) for engagement into lugs 
(4) of the housing of insulating material (3). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the guide means are designed as 

stamped-out parts of the stop slide (2) in conjunction 
with guide grooves in the housing of insulating 

material (3). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a parallelogram suspension is 

provided as guide means.  
 
Device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that there is at least one 

spiral spring (10) producing the spring power, which on 
one side engages on the stop slide (2) and on the other 

side on the housing of insulating material (3) in such 
a way that it maintains the two stop-slide positions in 

each case, in that, upon changing between stop-slide 
positions, a reversal of the direction of power of the 

spiral spring (10) takes place.
