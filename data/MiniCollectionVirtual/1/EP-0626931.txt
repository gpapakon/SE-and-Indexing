form of a thin and uniform layer of thickness lying in the range 0.2 mm to 2 mm on a

"first" face (41) of the two faces of a heat exchange wall (40), said wall being heated to a
temperature sufficient for implementing rapid evaporation of the water and/or of the

volatile components of the substance, that the layer of substance is crushed against this
first face (41) so that the layer of substance is levelled, the breaking up and the

spreading out of the layer being thereby encouraged , with the dry solid residue thereof
being continously

removed as it forms on said first face (41) by scraping said face, and said heat exchange
wall (40) is heated by the vapor that results from the evaporation after said vapor has

been mechanically compressed and then put into contact with the other "second" face (42)
of the wall (40) in such a manner as to cause it to condense thereon, and the hot liquid

condensate is removed therefrom, the non-condensible substances being eliminated by a
physicochemical treatment prior to recompression of the vapor.

each other, an "evaporation" one of the enclosures (101) being situated on the same side

as the first face (41), while the "condensation" other enclosure (102) is situated on the
same side as the second face (42) ;

evaporation enclosure (101); for elimimating non-condensible substances therefrom by a

physicochemical treatment ; for
