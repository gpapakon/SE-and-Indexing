<ABSTRACT>
The folding rule comprises at least one protective piece (30) which is attached to at least one of the end members (1) of the folding rule. A cutout (recess) (19) is produced in the free end part of the end member. This cutout (19) extends from the end face (5) of the said end part into the interior of the end member (1). The protective piece (30) is essentially T-shaped. The beam (31) of the protective piece (30) rests on the end face (5) of the end piece (1) in a tight or close fitting fashion. The shaft (50) of this protective piece is sunk (fitted, recessed) in the cutout (19) of the end member (1). The shaft (50) has fastening hooks (54) which engage with the walls of the cutout (19). Because of the use of the protective piece, no wear or damage can occur to the end face of the end member of the rule.

Folding rule according to the claim 1, characterized in that the beam
(136) of the protective piece (135) is shaped as parallelepiped, that the size of

the base of this beam (136) corresponds to the size of the front surface (5) of
the end piece (1) and that an extension (140) is carried out on at least one
 of
the side walls (137) of the beam (136), whereby said extension sticks out from

this side wall (137).
Folding rule according to the claim 1, characterized in that a deepening
(205) is carried out in the respective main or wide surface (203) of the

stalk (201), that an agglomeration (210) of the material of the end
member (1) rises from the inside of the recess (209) in the end member

(1) and that this agglomeration (210) lies in the deepening (205). 
Folding rule according to the claim 6, characterized in that the
deepenings (205) show a common ground (206) and open in to each other

opposite directions, that these deepenings (205) have advantageously an
essentially quadratic plan view, that the narrow side (202) of the stalk (201) of

the protective piece has a first section (211), one end of which is attached to to
the beam (31) of the T-shaped of protective piece (200), that one end of a

second section (212) of the narrow side (202) of the stalk (201) is attached to
the other end of said first wall section (211), that this second section (212)

extends diagonally and is directed against the middle axis A, that said narrow
side (202) shows a third wall-section (213), one end of which is connected to

the last named end of the second wall section (212), that said third wall section
(213) extends parallel to the longitudinal axis A of the stalk (201), that the other

end of the third wall section lies in the area of the end portion (37) of the stalk
(201), that the respective narrow wall (215) of the recess (209) shows a first

section, which corresponds to the first section (211) on the stalk (201), that the
narrow wall (215) furthermore shows a second section (216), which

corresponds to the second narrow-wall-section (212) on the stalk (201), that the
