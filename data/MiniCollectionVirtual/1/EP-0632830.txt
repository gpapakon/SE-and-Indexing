<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING RIBOTOXINSThe present invention relates to methods for the intracellular accumulation of a ribotoxin in a procaryotic host, to replicative expression vectors for use in such methods, and to procaryotic host cells transformed with such a replicative expression vector. Another aspect of the invention relates to secretion of a ribotoxin through the cytoplasmic membrane of a procaryotic host.BackgroundRibotoxins are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis. They are believed to act as enzymes on the 28S rRNA of the eucaryotic ribosome and can be divided into two classes (Jiminez, A et al., 1985, Ann. Rev Microbiol., 39, 649-672, and Wool, I.G. et al., 1990, in Hill, W.E. et al. (ed.) The Ribosome Structure, Function & Evolution, American Society of Microbiology, Washington DC, 203-214). Restrictocin, mitogillin and α-sarcin belong to the class which cleaves a single phosphodiester bond. Ricin belongs to the other class which cleaves an N-glycosidic linkage between base and ribose. The nucleotide sequence of the restrictocin gene has been described by Lamy, B. & Davies, J. in Nucleic Acids Research, 1991, 1 , 1001-1006.Such toxins may be used for example in the preparation of i munotoxins for cancer therapy. Pharmaceutical applications of toxins require access to relatively large quantities of toxin of a consistent quality. Cost-effective production techniques are of considerable commercial importance. Toxins may be obtained from their natural sources but this is undesirable because of poor yields and batch to batch variability leading to inconsistent product quality and high production cost. Natural sources are unsuitable for production of analogues of toxins which may be required for certain applications.Genetic engineering techniques may be applied to the production of toxins but in the case of restrictocin, mitogillin and α-sarcin known methods have failed to provide a cost-effective or high yielding production method. Restrictocin expression using recombinant DNA technology has been described by Lamy, B. and Davies, J. (Nucleic Acids Res. (1991) 19(5) plOOl-1006). They expressed and secreted restrictocin from Aspergillus nidulans, but the level of secretion was 

low, even lower than that from the natural producer strain, Aspergillus restrictus. There have been no reports of restrictocin expression in bacteria, although the related toxin, alpha sarcin, has been expressed in E.coli (Henze,P-P,C. et al. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 192, pl27-131). Again, expression was low, as the

CLAIMS
