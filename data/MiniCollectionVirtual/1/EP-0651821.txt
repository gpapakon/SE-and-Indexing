<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the enzymatic resolution of a 
racemic mixture of stereospecific, pharmaceutically useful 
in vivo inhibitors of γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase 
(GABA-T). γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important inhibitory 
neurotransmitter. When the concentration of GABA in the 
brain decreases below a threshold level, seizures and other 
neurological disorders occur (A.V. Delgado-Escueta et al., 
Basic Mechanisms of the Epilepsies, Raven Press, New York, 
365 (1986)). The appropriate level of GABA at the synaptic 
cleft can be maintained by the irreversible inactivation of 
the enzyme GABA-T, which is involved in the degradation of 
GABA (S.M. Nanavati et al., J. Med Chem., 32, 2413 (1989)). The biotransformation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to 
succinic acid semialdehyde, which is catalyzed by the 
enzyme GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), is the primary reaction 
responsible for the catabolism of GABA, an inhibitory 
neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. It is 
known that low levels of endogenous GABA are associated 
with seizure disorders (such as those involved in epilepsy,  
 
alcohol withdrawal, or barbiturate withdrawal), with 
disorders involving involuntary movement (such as those 
caused by the extrapyramidal effects of drugs, for example 
tardive dyskinesia) with certain psychiatric disorders 
(such as schizophrenia and depression) and with muscle 
spasticity. Blockade of the transformation of GABA to succinic 
acid semialdehyde, such as by irreversible inhibition 
of GABA-T, can elevate GABA levels in the central nervous 
system (CNS) and, thus provides a means for treating the 
disorders of the CNS associated with low GABA levels. Certain compounds are known to be irreversible inhibitors 
of GABA-T and thereby to elevate brain levels of 
GABA. Examples are 4-aminohex-5-enoic acid ("vinyl GABA"), 
4-aminohex-5-ynoic acid ("acetylenic GABA" or "ethynyl 
GABA") and 4-amino-hepta-5,6-dienoic acid ("allenyl-GABA") 
(see U.S. Patent Nos. 3,960,927, 3,959,356, and 4,454,156;
