<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing free radical cellular oxidative stress in warm-blooded animals showing symptoms of free radical toxicity is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of confirming the presence of a free radical cellular oxidative stress in the animal; determining which trace minerals selected from the group consisting of copper, zinc, iron and manganese, with or without optional amounts of selenium are needed to strengthen and maintain the functioning of enzymes which relate to oxidative bursts in neutrophils and macrophages in the animal; providing a composition containing effective amounts of at least one of the minerals copper, zinc, iron and manganese in the form of an amino acid chelate having a ligand to mineral ratio of at least 1:1, a molecular weight of no more than 1500 daltons and a stability constant of between about 10

, with or without optional amounts of selenium which may be present either in amino acid chelated form or as inorganic selenium, and administering the composition to the animal, preferably in oral form. The presence of free radical cellular oxidative stress is preferably confirmed by direct assay of the activity of oxidative enzymes selected from the group consisting of CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase and catalase.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR REDUCING FREERADICAL CELLULAR OXIDATIVE STRESS INWARM-BLOODED ANIMALS BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to compositions and methods of reducing free radical cellular oxidative stress in warm-blooded animals showing symptoms of free radical toxicity. More particularly, this invention relates to amino acid chelated mineral compositions containing one or more minerals selected from the group consisting of copper, zinc, iron and manganese and to methods of administering these compositions to strengthen and maintain the functioning of enzymes which help regulate the effects of oxidative bursts for killing or deactivating pathogens and foreign matter in neutrophils and macrophages. These enzymes function to adequately remove the superoxides, peroxides and hydroxides that are formed in the cells. These enzymes are inclusive of, but not limited to, the superoxide dismutases (SOD) , catalase and glutathione peroxidase. As previously stated, they function to remove the superoxides, peroxides and hydroxides that are formed in the cells. Otherwise oxygen toxicity results. The superoxide radical is formed during various metabolic processes, many of which are considered normal. Liver cells, muscle cells, leukocytes, erythrocytes, aerobic bacteria, any cell that undergoes oxidative cellular metabolism, all form superoxide radicals during normal metabolic processes. These oxygen radicals are converted to hydrogen peroxide by CuZn-superoxide dismutases (CuZnSOD) in the cells. In a properly functioning system the hydrogen peroxide is 

 then converted to oxygen and water by a catalase. If the hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide radical are allowed to combine, the more reactive and destructive hydroxide radical is formed. When the formation of one or more of the superoxide, hydrogen peroxide or hydroxide radicals becomes uncontrolled or the organism loses the ability to regulate these reactions, changes in cellular physiology result that become detrimental to the individual cells, organ systems, or the entire host or animal. Some of these changes include generalized tissue destruction, lameness and joint inflammation, DNA miscoding or degradation, lipid peroxidation, altered immune function and inactivation of important cellular enzymes. The primary activated superoxide dismutase (SOD) in animals is CuZnSOD. This metalloenzy e undergoes a reduction-oxidation exchange with the superoxide radical with the net result of dismutation of the superoxide radical to hydrogen

6. A method according to Claim 5 wherein said composition is continuously available to said animal.
7. A method according to Claim 4 wherein said composition is administered in unit dosage form. 8. A method according to Claim 3 wherein the trace minerals to administer and the effective amount of trace minerals in said composition are determined by reference to collected data of mineral amounts and ratios found in animals afflicted by free radical cellular oxidative stress and compared to mineral amounts and ratios found in animals of the same species not afflicted by free radical cellular oxidative stress.
9. A method according to Claim 8 wherein the presence of free radical cellular oxidative stress in said animal is confirmed by an assay for red blood cells for activity of oxidative enzymes selected from the group consisting of CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase and catalase. 


 10. A method according to Claim 9 wherein the composition administered contains copper, zinc and manganese.
11. A method according to Claim 10 wherein the copper, zinc and manganese are present in molar ratio ranges of about 1.5-2.5:1.5-2.5:0.5-1.5 respectively.
12. A method according to Claim 11 wherein the copper, zinc and manganese are present in molar ratios of about 2:2:1 respectively. 13. A method according to Claim 8 wherein the animal is of the porcine species and exhibits symptoms of porcine stress syndrome.
14. A method according to Claim 4 wherein the animal is of the bovine species. 15. A method according to Claim 4 wherein the effective amount of trace minerals to be administered is determined after taking into consideration the content and balance of nutrients in the food ration and water also available to said animal.
