<ABSTRACT>
A fire detecting apparatus is designed to have improved reliability by reducing 
the possibility that the apparatus is influenced by an environmental change, external 

noise or the like which would otherwise cause erroneous fire information to be sent to 
a receiving unit to generate a false alarm. The apparatus includes a light emitting 

device (10) for detecting a physical quantity of one of fire phenomena such as smoke, a light 
receiving device (11), an A/D converter circuit (14), a RAM (7) for successively storing a 

predetermined number of latest detection outputs from the A/D converter circuit, an 
MPU (3) for calculating deviations between the predetermined number of latest detection 

outputs stored in the RAM and for calculating an average value of at least two of the 
detection outputs having a smallest deviation, and a transmitting/receiving circuit (17) for 

sending the average value calculated by the MPU as a physical quantity of the one fire 
phenomenon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fire detecting apparatus
comprising detection means for detecting a physical quantity of
a fire phenomenon, according to the introduction of claim 1, and
more particularly, to a fire detecting apparatus capable of
transmitting information on a physical quantity, e.g. an analog
quantity, of a detected fire phenomenon such as smoke, heat,
light of fire or flames, gas, smell, or the like to a receiving
section of a fire receiver, a relay unit, or the like.Conventionally, an analog type photoelectric fire detector having a smoke
detection chamber, a light emitting element and a light receiving element incorporated
therein is known as this kind of fire detecting apparatus. The detector detects a
physical quantity of smoke in response to a light emitting control signal which is output
at predetermined time intervals (e.g., three seconds) from a built-in clock device such
as a timer, or when it receives a polling signal which is sent from a receiving unit to call
the detector at the predetermined time intervals (e.g., three seconds). The detector
then converts a signal related to the physical quantity into a digital signal, for example,
and sends this signal to the receiving unit. (See, for example, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 249299/1987).There have been proposed other types of conventional fire detecting
apparatuses, e.g., an analog thermal-type fire detector using a thermal element in a
measuring circuit section for measuring a temperature or the like, an analog
ionization-type fire detector having an ion chamber with a plurality of internal electrodes
in a measuring circuit section for measuring the density of smoke or the like. Operating 
power is supplied to the measuring circuit section and an output circuit section of these
types of detectors only when a match occurs between an address signal input via a
transmission line and an address assigned to the detector. (See, for example,
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 178794/1984.)The conventional fire detecting apparatuses, arranged as described above,
entails the following problem. For example, in the case of a photoelectric type fire
detector, the light receiving element of the detector may detect external light noise such
as camera strobe light during smoke detecting operation, or induced noise may be
superimposed on the light receiving output. A noise signal component caused by such
noise is sent to the light receiving unit as a physical quantity. As a result, the receiving
unit mistakenly determines occurrence
