<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for producing a semiconductor 
single-crystal (S) grown by the Czochralski method includes 

a reference reflector (12) disposed at the lower end of a 
gas rectifying tube (P), first and second optical systems 

(16, 20) disposed above the reference reflector for changing 
the direction of propagation of light from the horizontal to 

the vertical, and vice versa, a first position sensor (14) 
composed of a first light source for emitting a light beam 

in a horizontal direction toward the first optical system, 
and a first photosensitive member which receives a reflection 

light reflected from the melt surface (24) in a crucible 
(C), a second position sensor (18) composed of a second 

light source for emitting a light beam in a horizontal 
direction toward the second optical system, and a second 

photosensitive member which receives a reflection light 
reflected from the reference reflector. With this construction, 

the distance between the gas rectifying tube and the 
melt surface can be detected and maintained constant 

throughout the crystal growth process with the result that 
the crystal quality, especially the concentration of dopant 

and impurities such as oxygen and carbon crystal is uniform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method 
of and an apparatus for producing a semiconductor single-crystal 
grown by the Czochralski (CZ) method, and more 
particularly to a CZ semiconductor single-crystal growth 
system of the type having a gas rectifying tube and a position 
sensor for detecting the position or level of the melt 
surface in a crucible. The Czochralski (CZ) method is known as a semiconductor 
single-crystal growth method in which a single crystal 
ingot is grown by pulling from the melt of a semiconductor 
material contained in a crucible. In an apparatus used 
for carrying out the CZ method, in order to control the 
concentration of a dopant and impurities, such as oxygen and 
carbon, in a growing crystal, the crucible is lifted with a 
change in the amount of the melt in the crucible to maintain 
the melt surface at a constant level during the entire 
crystal growth process. Especially in a CZ single-crystal 
growing apparatus of the type having a gas rectifying tube, 
the lower end of the gas rectifying tube and the melt surface 
must be kept in a constant positional relationship. Accordingly, accurate detection and measurement of 
the position or level of the melt surface are required for 
achieving a precision control of the dopant and impurity  
 
concentrations in the growing crystal. In the case of the 
apparatus embodying the gas rectifying tube, the distance or 
spacing between the lower end of the gas rectifying tube and 
the melt surface must be detected and measured with accuracy. FIG. 3 diagrammatically shows a position sensor 
associated with a conventional CZ semiconductor single-crystal 
growing apparatus 40 for detecting the position of 
the melt surface. The conventional position sensor is 
constructed such that a beam of light emitted from a light 
source 42 passes through a first view port 46 on a chamber 
44 and strikes upon the surface of a melt M contained in a 
quartz crucible C. A reflection light reflected from the 
melt surface propagates through a second view port 48 and is 
received by a photosensitive member 50. The photosensitive 
member 50 detects the position of the melt surface depending 
on the position of the reflection light received, which 
position is varied with a change in position of the melt 
surface. However, the position sensor of the foregoing construction 
cannot operate properly when a growing single-crystal 
or a gas rectifying tube is present in the chamber. 
This is because, due to the presence of an obstacle (i.e., 
the
