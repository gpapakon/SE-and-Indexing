A fireproofing compound containing binders, flameproofing agents, 
inorganic fibres and plasticizers, characterized in that it is free from antimony 

compounds, asbestos and health-damaging flame retardants, more 
particularly halogen-containing flame retardants, with the proviso that 


a) polymers are present as the binder, the polymers being required to 
have a glass transition temperature Tg above -30°C, a minimum film-forming 

temperature MFT of ≥0°C, a tensile strength of ≤5 N/mm
2
 and 
a breaking elongation of ≥400% and the binder being present in a 

quantity of 5 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of the 
fireproofing compound, 
b) the substances present as flameproofing agents are water-insoluble 
solids with a mean particle diameter of 1 to 50 µm, 
c) the inorganic fibres have a mean length of 300 µm and a mean 
thickness of 10 µm, the fibres being present in a total quantity of 0.2 

to 27.5% by weight, based on the total weight of the fireproofing 
compound. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
it is totally halogen-free and, more particularly, chlorine-free. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that it contains aqueous dispersions of plastics or synthetic resins, more 

particularly halogen-free aqueous dispersions, as the binder. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it contains substances which are halogen-free, non-toxic 

and/or free from toxicologically and ecologically unsafe heavy metal compounds 
as flameproofing agents. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the flameproofing compound is present in a quantity of 

10 to 60% by weight and, more particularly, 20 to 50% by weight, based on 
the total weight of the fireproofing compound.  

 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it contains inorganic solids which react endothermally 

on heating, more particularly with melting, sublimation, phase transition or in 
a solid-state reaction, as flameproofing agents. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the solids react with elimination of gases, more particularly non-inflammable 

gases. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it contains a mixture of inorganic and organic fibres as 

the fibres. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that 

it contains 0.1 to 20% by weight and, more particularly, 0.5 to 10% by weight 
of inorganic fibres and 0.1 to 7.5% by weight and, more particularly, 0.1 to 

3.5% by weight of organic fibres, based on the total weight of the fireproofing 
compound. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in claim 8 or 9, characterized in 
that the organic fibres have an average thickness of 15 µm and an average 

length of 1000 µm. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it contains toxicologically safe phosphoric acid esters, 

more particularly toxicologically safe halogen-free phosphoric acid esters, as 
plasticizers. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the plasticizers are present in a quantity of 0.1 to 10% 

by weight and, more particularly, 1 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight 
of the fireproofing compound. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in claim 11 or 12, characterized 
in that the phosphoric acid ester has a P content of ≥ 7%. 
A fireproofing compound as claimed in any of claims 11 to 13, 
characterized in that at least one acid function of the phosphoric acid ester  

 
is saturated with an aromatic radical. 
The use of the fireproofing compound according to any of the 
preceding claims for the production of fireproof coatings and fireproof 

closures, such as seals and pointings.
