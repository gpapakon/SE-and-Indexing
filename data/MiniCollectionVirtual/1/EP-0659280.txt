<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the automatic fuelling of vehicles, primarily cars, comprising a robot (2) which includes a robot head (3) that is movable relative to the robot so as to enable it to be brought to a predetermined position in relation to the vehicle fuel-tank pipe, this positioning of the robot head being effected by means of a positioning system which includes a transceiver unit that is mounted adjacent the robot head, said unit preferably being constructed to operate at microwave frequency, and a passive transponder (13) which is placed in a predetermined position on the vehicle. The invention is characterized by a plurality of different transponders (13) of which only one is carried by a vehicle; in that each of said transponders (13) is provided with a simple code which the transponder is intended to modulate on a signal transmitted by the transceiver unit (14) and reflected by the transponder; and by a decoder (15) which functions to decode the code from the signal received by the transceiver unit (14) from the transponder (13) and delivers the code to a computer (23) connected to the robot; in that the computer (23) includes a memory in which a specific movement plan is stored for each code; and in that the computer is constructed to steer the robot head (3) in the movement plan defined by the received code.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for automatic
refuelling of vehicles, primarily cars.An apparatus by means of which cars are fuelled automatically
is described in Swedish Patent Specification
No. 8901674-5, (WO 90 135/2).The apparatus according to this patent publication
comprises a robot which includes a fuelling nozzle or
corresponding device and which when the vehicle is
placed in a predetermined position in relation to the
robot is intended to move the refuelling nozzle automatically
from a rest position to a vehicle fuelling
position in response to sensing and control means. The
fuelling nozzle includes a rigid first tubular element
or tube which is intended to be moved by the robot
towards an adapter provided with a hole which belongs
to the vehicle fuelling location. A flexible, second
tube is arranged for movement within the first, rigid
tube from a first end position in which the outer free
end of the second tube is located within the first
tube, to a second end position in which the second
tube projects out from the first tube. A tube connection
is provided between said hole and the vehicle
fuel-tank pipe. The robot is constructed to move the
free end of the second tube out of the first tube and
down into said tube connection, or down into the
vehicle fuel-tank pipe, and pump fuel through the
second tube down into the tank of the vehicle.Swedish Patent Specification No. 9001575-1 (WO9117111) describes a
method of opening and closing a vehicle fuelling flap
which lies flush with the vehicle chassis and which
can be swung between an open and a closed position
around a vertical or horizontal axis and which covers
the space in which the inlet orifice of the fuel-tank
pipe is located. According to this patent publication, 
the flap, or cover plate, is opened in two stages and
different opening means are used in each of said
stages.One problem is that a large number of mutually different
fuel-tank flaps exist and that these flaps are
positioned in mutually different places. The problem
is that it is necessary for the robot head to perform
many different movements when a flap opening device is
manoeuvered by means of robot head movement.According to the last-mentioned patent publication, a
vehicle-mounted transponder which coacts with a transceiver
unit fitted to the robot head contains information
relating to the particular pattern of movement
that is to be carried out by the robot head in the
case of the vehicle concerned at that time. The transceiver
unit also coacts with the

Apparatus for the automatic fuelling of vehicles,
primarily cars, comprising a robot (2) which includes a robot

head (3) that is movable relative to the robot so as to enable
it to be brought to a predetermined position in relation to the

vehicle fuel-tank pipe, this positioning of the robot head
being effected by means of a positioning system which includes

a transceiver unit that is mounted adjacent the robot head,
said unit preferably being constructed to operate at microwave

frequency, and a passive transponder (13) which is placed in a
predetermined position on the vehicle, wherein the robot head

includes an outer tube (8) and an inner tube (9) which is
housed within said outer tube and movable out of said tube,

wherein the outer tube (8) is intended to be docked with an

adapter (7) which is attached to the upper orifice of the fuel-tank
pipe, and wherein subsequent to docking said outer tube,

the free forward end of the inner tube is intended to be
projected to a position down in the fuel-tank pipe, whereafter

fuel is delivered through the inner tube, and wherein the robot
head (3) carries a flap opening device (11) which functions to

open a fuel-tank flap (2) in response to movements of the robot
head, 
characterized
 by a plurality of different
transponders (13) of which only one is carried by a vehicle; in

that each of said transponders (13) is provided with a simple
code which the transponder is intended to modulate on a signal

transmitted by the transceiver unit (14) and reflected by the
transponder when the robot head (3) is positioned in predetermined

position relative to the transponder; and by a decoder
(15) which functions to decode the code from the signal received

by the transceiver unit (14) from the transponder (13)
and delivers the code to a computer (23) connected to the

robot; in that the computer (23) includes a memory in which a
specific movement plan is stored for each code; and in that the

computer is constructed to steer the robot head (3) in the
movement plan defined by the received code upon the receipt of

said code in order to open the fuel-tank flap (2) and in order
to position the robot head (3) relative to fuel-tank pipe of

the vehicle. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that each of the transponders (13) includes a
modulator (16) which modulates the received signal with a

frequency which is specific to each transponder and which forms
said code.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that each of the transponders (13) includes a
modulator (16) and a pulse train generator (17) which functions

to modulate the received signal with a pulse train which is
specific to each individual transponder and which forms said

code.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in that the opening device (11) includes a
resilient bellows-like element (18) which is mounted on a shaft

(20) for pivotal movement against the action of a spring force,
said pivot shaft being positioned perpendicularly to the plane

in which the robot head (3) moves during an opening operation,
wherein in its rest position the bellows-like element (18)

extends parallel with the outer tube (8) of the robot head (3);
and in that the forward, free end (21) of the bellows-like

element is open, whereas the other the (22) of said element is
connected to a subpressure source.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4,

characterized
 in that the transponder (13) is
placed on the vehicle in a position such that said transponder

will be located centrally opposite the antenna of the transceiver
unit (14) on the robot head (3) when the robot head (3)

is docked with the adapter (7).
