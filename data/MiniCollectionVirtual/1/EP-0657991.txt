<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal detecting 
circuit for digital controller detecting quantity of state 
necessary for control from a signal detecting circuit in a 
digital controller such as an exciter for synchronous machine 
or automatic voltage regulator, particularly from 
instantaneous value of alternating current signal. A digital controller performs control by receiving 
instantaneous value of alternating current from an instrument 
potential transformer or an instrument current transformer and 
detecting quantity of state necessary for control. In the past, detection of the control signal has been 
performed totally by digital processing including removing a 
direct current component in the signal and a surge component 
at occurrence of an electric power system accident, as 
described in,for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No.63-305725 (1988). However, removing of the direct 
current component and the surge has been not sufficient. And 
it is known another method in which the direct current 
component and the surge are absorbed by providing an analog 
filter as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No.4-213 (1992). In the conventional methods described above, even when  
 
signal has the direct current component and the surge at 
occurrence of an electric power system accident, the signal 
is detected in the same way as a normal state. Thereby, there 
is a disadvantage in that the control becomes instable. 
Therefore, it has been considered to solve this problem by 
providing an analog filter for removing the direct current 
component and absorbing the surge. However, it has been revealed that there arises a new 
problem that the signal to be detected is attenuated due to 
attaching the analog filter. An object of the present invention is to solve the 
problem caused by attaching said analog filter. The present 
invention is basically characterized by solving the 
aforementioned problem by performing gain correction and phase 
correction using frequency. The main object of the present invention can be attained 
by providing an analog filter for removing the direct current 
component and absorbing the surges in order to remove the 
direct current component and the surge contained in a control 
signal, and by providing frequency correcting means for 
detecting the frequency (f) of the detected signal passed 
through the analog filter and for performing frequency (f) 
correction to the root-mean-square value of the instantaneous 
value of alternating current
