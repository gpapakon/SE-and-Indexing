<ABSTRACT>
An amalgam (34) is accurately placed and 
retained in an optimal location near the cold spot of 

an electrodeless SEF lamp (10) for operation at a mercury 
vapor pressure in the optimum range from approximately 

four to seven millitorr. The amalgam (34) is positioned at 
the tip of an extended exhaust tube (30) near the apex (24) of 

the lamp envelope (12) by forming an indentation (36) in the 
exhaust tube (30) and, in some embodiments, a dose locating 

member (38) in combination therewith. An evacuation hole (40) 

is formed below the indentation (36) for evacuation of the 
lamp envelope (12), or bulb, during lamp fabrication. In 

an alternative embodiment, the extension (52) of the 
exhaust tube (50) is situated perpendicular to the main 

portion of the tube to allow for lateral adjustment of 
the position of the amalgam (34), thereby allowing for even 

further control of the amalgam (34) operating temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
fluorescent lamps and, more particularly, to accurate 
placement and retention of an amalgam in a solenoidal 
electric field fluorescent discharge lamp for 
optimally controlling mercury vapor pressure therein, 
which amalgam placement and retention do not interfere 
with lamp processing and furthermore are maintained 
during lamp operation, regardless of lamp orientation. The optimum mercury vapor pressure for 
production of 2537 Å radiation to excite a phosphor 
coating in a fluorescent lamp is approximately six 
millitorr, corresponding to a mercury reservoir 
temperature of approximately 40°C. Conventional 
tubular fluorescent lamps operate at a power density 
(i.e., typically measured as power input per phosphor 
area) and in a fixture configured to ensure operation 
of the lamp at or about a mercury vapor pressure of 
six millitorr (typically in a range from approximately  
 
four to seven millitorr); that is, the lamp and 
fixture are designed such that the coolest location 
(i.e., cold spot) of the fluorescent lamp is 
approximately 40°C. Compact fluorescent lamps, 
however, including electrodeless solenoidal electric 
field (SEF) fluorescent discharge lamps, operate at 
higher power densities with the cold spot temperature 
typically exceeding 50°C. As a result, the mercury 
vapor pressure is higher than the optimum four to 
seven millitorr range, and the luminous output of the 
lamp is decreased. One approach to controlling the mercury 
vapor pressure in an SEF lamp is to use an alloy 
capable of absorbing mercury from its gaseous phase in 
varying amounts, depending upon temperature 
conditions. Alloys capable of forming amalgams with 
mercury have been found to be particularly useful. 
The mercury vapor pressure of such an amalgam at a 
given temperature is lower than the mercury vapor 
pressure of pure liquid mercury. Unfortunately, accurate placement and 
retention of an amalgam to achieve a mercury vapor 
pressure in the optimum range in an SEF lamp are 
difficult. For stable long-term operation, the 
amalgam should be placed and retained in a relatively 
cool location with minimal temperature variation. 
Such optimal locations are at or near the tip, or 
apex, of the lamp envelope, or crown. Accordingly, it 
is desirable to place the amalgam in an optimal 
position near the cold spot of the lamp. Moreover, to 
achieve the desired beneficial effects of an amalgam 
in an SEF lamp, the amalgam should maintain its 
composition and optimized
