<ABSTRACT>
A composite syringe has an injector body (1) and a cylindrical 
protector (2) which covers a cylinder (14) of the injector body (1). The 

protector (2) includes a sleeve (22) separably connected to a base (21) 
which is secured to an outer periphery of the cylinder's forward end. 

The sleeve (22), when separated from the base (21), is caused to slide 
towards the cylinder's end and beyond a tip (15) holding a needle (3), 

until it engages again with the base (21) at a position where the 
needle (3) is covered entirely with the sleeve (22). This prevents any 

accident of erroneous pricking or puncture of a user of the 
syringe or other people coming into contact with the syringe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composite syringe comprising:
an injector body; anda cylindrical protector covering the injector body; said
injector body comprising:a cylinder;a tip extending from the cylinder for holding a medical
needle; anda skirt surrounding the tip and extending coaxially
thereof;said cylindrical protector comprising:
a sleeve slidable on the cylinder toward said tip;a base surrounding and firmly held to the skirt, said
sleeve extending from said base towards the rear of said
injector body, the syringe further including:a lockable member formed on an inner periphery of said
sleeve; anda locking member formed on the outer periphery of said
base.In particular, the invention provides a disposable composite
syringe, and, more particularly, provides a composite syringe
in which the needle can be sealed so as to prevent erroneously
pricking or puncturing people who may come into contact with the
syringe. Every medical needle, once used, is usually thrown away,
whether it is an ordinary needle of the injector type or a vein
needle retained for intravenous drip injection of a liquid
medicine or for transfusion of blood. The acute needle ends are
covered with proper protectors, before being discarded, in order
to prevent injury to the people who come into contact with the
needles. However, those who work in various medical fields and
handle the needles are still exposed to danger, because the
needle ends may possibly cause injury when attaching the
protectors thereto. Such an accident could cause a serious
problem in addition to the simple pain due to a skin prick. For
example, the needle ends which have been used on patients are
sometimes polluted or exposed to various pathogens such as
bacilli and viruses, thereby exposing healthy people to such
bacilli and viruses.Many ideas directed to prevention of such an erroneous
exposure by the used needles include those which are disclosed 
in the Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publications: Sho. 60-55448;
Sho. 61-85239; Hei. 4-58256, the Unexamined Patent
Publications: Hei. 4-244167; Hei. 2-1288; Hei. 4-90766; Sho. 62-144666;

of Unexamined International Patent Application: Hei.
3-504808.Publications 60-55448 and 61-85239 disclose protectors that
have sockets of a modified shape. An example of the sockets has
an enlarged diameter enlarged towards its end with another socket
having a flange adjacent thereto, and still another socket has
slits extending longitudinally thereof.Disclosed in

A composite syringe comprising:

an injector body (1); and
a cylindrical protector (2) covering the injector body
(1); said injector body (1) comprising:


a cylinder (14);
a tip (15) extending from the cylinder (14) for holding a
medical needle (3); and
a skirt (16) surrounding the tip (15) and extending
coaxially thereof;
said cylindrical protector (2) comprising:

a sleeve (22) slidable on the cylinder (14) toward said
tip (15);
a base (21) surrounding and firmly held to the skirt
(16), said sleeve (22) extending from said base (21) towards

the rear of said injector body (1), the syringe further including:
a lockable member (24) formed on an inner periphery of
said sleeve (22); and
a locking member (25) formed on the outer periphery of
said base (21),

characterized in that

(1) said sleeve (22) has an end portion connected to and
breakable from an end portion of said base (21) so that

said sleeve (22) is separable from said base (21) and
(2) said breakable connection between said sleeve (22) and
said base (21) being designed such that after breaking

said sleeve (22) from said base (21) said lockable member
(24) is engageable with said locking member (25) so that 

said sleeve (22) is locked in a position to circumferentially
enclose the medical needle (3).
A composite syringe as defined in claim 1, characterized
in that said base (21) is connected to said sleeve (22) by at

least one bridge element (23).
A composite syringe as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said base (21) and said sleeve (22) are integral

with one another and formed of materials substantially
immiscible with each other.
A composite syringe as defined in any one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the lockable member (24) is a plurality

of lugs positioned on an inner periphery of the rear end
portion of said sleeve (22), and the locking member (25) is an

annular groove formed on an outer periphery of said base (21).
A composite syringe as defined in any one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the lockable member (24) is an annular

groove provided on an inner periphery of the rear end portion
of said sleeve (22), and the locking member (25) is a

plurality of lugs positioned on an outer periphery of said
base (21).
A composite syringe as defined in any one of claims 1 to
5, characterized in that said sleeve (22) is extendible concentrically

with the medical neede (3) to a length which is
greater than a predetermined length of the medical needle (3).
