Improved semi-automatic shotgun of the type comprising
a magazine tube (8) around which a cylinder (9) is

situated, the interior of which is in connection with the
interior of the barrel (2) and with, in this cylinder (9)

and around the magazine tube (8), on one hand, a piston
(10) which can shift under the effect of a part of the

propulsion gases and can cooperate with a sleeve (12)
which is provided with a rod (13) which is capable to

control the assembly of movable parts (14), and, on the
other hand, a regulation or pressure control valve (11),

springs (17-42) provided for the control of the reverse
motion of the sleeve (12) and the regulation valve (11),

characterized in that the regulation valve (11) is
completely situated in the piston unit (10).
Gun according to claim 1, characterized in that the
regulation valve (11) is arranged coaxially in the piston

unit (10).
Gun according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the regulation valve (11) can move in respect to the

piston unit (10) and that the regulation valve (11) and
the piston unit (10) can move in respect to the cylinder

(9) fixed at the barrel (2), and this in the same sense
and the same direction.
Gun according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in
that the piston unit (10) is blocked, in its inoperative

position, between the said cylinder (9) fixed at the
barrel (2) and the sleeve (12) which is connected to the

rod (13), respectively the assembly of movable parts
(14). 
Gun according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the regulation valve (11) is

blocked, in its inoperative position, between two opposed
points which are realized at the extremities of the

piston unit (10).
Gun according to claim 5, characterized in that the
regulation valve (11), under the effect of a spring (42),

is forced permanently against a circular surface (41)
which is directed radially in the interior of the piston

unit (10).
Gun according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the piston unit (10), under the

effect of a spring (17), is forced permanently against a
wall (28) of the cylinder (9).
Gun according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the piston unit (10) is formed of a

first tubular element (18) which is situated in the bore
(23) of the cylinder (9), and of a second tubular element

(24) of larger diameter forming an abutment (27), which,
on one hand, can cooperated with said wall (28) of the

cylinder (9) and, on the other hand, with said sleeve
(12).
Gun according to claim 8, characterized in that the
tubular element (24) of the piston unit (10) comprises

evacuation openings (29) situated at the forward end of
this tubular element (24).
Gun according to claim 8, characterized in that the
tubular element (18) of the piston unit (10) , at its

exterior side, is provided with at least one toric
sealing ring (21). 
Gun according to claim 10, characterized in that the

toric sealing ring (21) is situated in a recess (20) of
the tubular element (18).
Gun according to claim 8, characterized in that the
rear end of the tubular element (24) of the piston unit

(10) is provided with screw thread (25) at its interior,
with which an adjustment ring (26) can cooperate.
Gun according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the smallest interior diameter of

the piston unit (10) is considerably larger than the
exterior diameter of the magazine tube (8).
Gun according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the regulation valve (11) consists

of a tubular element (30) situated in a bore (34) of the
piston unit (10), whereby this tubular element (30) is

provided, at its interior, with a recess (37) in which at
least one toric sealing ring (34) is situated, and, at

the exterior, with a support ring (38) which can
cooperate with the bore (39) of the corresponding part,

more particularly, the tubular element (24) of the piston
unit (24).
Gun according to claim 14, characterized in that the
tubular element (30) of the regulation valve (11) is

provided at its exterior surface with several
longitudinal channels (31) for the passage of gases.
Gun according to claim 14 or 15, characterized in
that the forward part (32) of the regulation valve (11)
