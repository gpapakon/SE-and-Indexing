<ABSTRACT>
A smoke charge (smoke grenade) for emitting a quickly burning concealment component which produces spontaneous smoke, and a slowly burning camouflage component which produces long-term smoke, having a fuze system for igniting an ejection charge, the camouflage component and the concealment component, the concealment component acting before the camouflage component in the air after initiation of the smoke charge, and the spontaneous smoke and the long-term smoke being essentially collocated in the target, characterised in that a stress-relief space is arranged between the camouflage component and the concealment component, which stress-relief space is connected via a first channel to a first ignition space which is adjacent to the ejection charge, in such a manner that the pressure which is produced on ignition of the ejection charge results in the concealment component being separated from the camouflage component and the profile of the ballistic path of the concealment component and that of the ballistic path of the camouflage component differing from one another in such a manner that the concealment component and the camouflage component approach one another at the target location to such an extent that the collocation of the spontaneous smoke and of the long-term smoke which approaches it delayed in time is ensured without any mechanical connection between the camouflage component and the concealment component.

<CLAIMS>
A smoke charge comprising a quick-burning decoy 
component (6) producing spontaneous smoke and a slow-burning 

camouflage component (4) producing permanent 
smoke, both adapted to be fired from the smoke charge; 


an ejection charge (30); and 
an ignition system for igniting the ejection charge 
(30), the camouflage component (4) and the decoy 

component (6), wherein after the smoke charge has been 
primed, the decoy component (6) operates in air before 

the camouflage component (4) and the spontaneous smoke 
(216) and the permanent smoke (214) are substantially 

collocated at the target, 
 
characterised in that 


a relief chamber (60) is disposed between the 
camouflage component (4) and the decoy component (6) 

and is connected via a first duct to an ignition 
chamber (40) adjoining the ejection charge (30), the 

diameter of this first duct (50) being so adapted to 
the volume of the ignition chamber (40) and the relief 

chamber (60) that, when the ejection charge (30) is 
ignited, the resulting pressure separates the decoy 

component (6) from the camouflage component (4), and 
accelerates it relatively to the camouflage component 

(4), so that the decoy component (6) and the camouflage 
component (4) move along different ballistic paths 

(204, 106) with the result that the decoy component (6)  
 

and the camouflage component (4) approach one another 
at the target, and 
the ignition system (10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) 
comprises a first delay means and a first ignition and 

disintegration charge for igniting the camouflage 
component (4) and a second delay means and a second 

ignition and disintegration charge for igniting the 
decoy component (6), the two delay members being so 

dimensioned relatively to the ballistic paths (204, 
206) that the decoy component (6) is ignited before the 

camouflage component (4) and the camouflage component 
(4) comes to rest below the decoy component (6) 

disintegration point, so that the spontaneous smoke 
(216) generated by the decoy component and the 

camouflage smoke (214) generated by the camouflage 
component (4) are collocated without mechanically 

connecting the camouflage component (4) and the decoy 
component (6). 
A smoke charge according to claim 1, characterised 
in that a separating charge (70) is provided between 

the camouflage component (4) and the decoy component 
(6) and can be so primed via the ignition system (10, 

30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) that it accelerates the 
decoy component (6) relatively to the camouflage 

component (4). 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the camouflage component 

(4) and/or the decoy component (6) have an air-resistance 
coefficient such that the decoy component  

 
(6) moves faster than the camouflage component (4) 

after firing. 
A smoke charge according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the camouflage component (4) is equipped with a 

braking mechanism, such as extending wings or the like. 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a contact head (10) and an 

elongated sleeve (20) connected to the contact head 
(10), the contact head (10) and the sleeve (20) being 

insertable into a launcher cup and forming a secondary 
launcher cup from which the decoy component (6) and the 

camouflage component (4) can be fired after 
transmission of an ignition pulse to the contact head 

(10), whereas the contact head (10) and the sleeve (20) 

remain in the launcher cup. 
A smoke charge according to claim 5, characterised 
in that the sleeve (20), at its end remote from the 

contact head (10), is substantially flush with the 
decoy component (6), and thus encloses all the 

necessary components of the smoke charge (2). 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a second duct (90) is 

connected to the relief chamber (60) and is at least 
partly situated in the region of the decoy component 

(6).  
 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the contact head (10) is 

connected by contact rings or a coil to a first 
electric igniter, such as a priming capsule or the 

like, for igniting the ejection charge (30). 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the ammunition is modular 

in construction, each module being connected to the 
ignition system (10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) and a 

first module comprising the camouflage component (4) 
and a second module comprising the decoy component (6). 
A smoke charge according to claim 9, characterised 
in that in each module an interface (50), which is an 

electric and/or pyrotechnic interface, is fixed 
relatively to the next module. 
A smoke charge according to claim 10,
 
characterised in that an electric interface leads to at 

least one second electric igniter such as a priming 
capsule or the like. 
A smoke charge according to claim 10 or 11,
 
characterised in that a pyrotechnic interface (50) 

comprises at least one pyroline, such as a fuse or the 
like. 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the decoy component (6) 

is surrounded by a can (100).  
 
A smoke charge according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the camouflage component 

(4) is in the form of mouldings, which spread when the 
camouflage component lands on the ground.
