<ABSTRACT>
A process system is disclosed for the treatment of 
a waste sand material containing metal contaminants, generally 

including lead, copper, chromium, mercury and cadmium, among 
other heavy metals; where the process provides for the 

contacting of the waste sand material with a paint decomposer, 
attrition abrading this sand slurry, size separating the 

attrition abraded slurry to form a waste sand slurry and a 
cleaned sand, and removing a portion of the excess water 

content in the waste sand slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for the 
treatment of waste sand containing metal contaminants. More 
particularly, the processes relate to the concentration of 
lead and other metal elements in waste sandblasting sand and 
the production of a cleaned sand containing acceptable levels 
of these contaminants. The maintenance of aging steel structures, such as 
bridges and overpasses, poses a serious problem for governmental 
officials. These structures usually have layers of paint 
to prevent corrosion which, in certain cases, must be removed 
before reconditioning with new paint. The problem is that the 
old paint, especially the primer undercoat paint layer, may 
contain lead. The removal of this lead-based paint is 
typically accomplished by a sandblasting technique. However, 
the waste created by this process is a large volume of waste 
sand contaminated with metals, such as lead. The contaminated 
sand must be disposed of as a toxic material under environmental 
regulations, and this disposal is therefore expensive. There exist various methods for the treatment of 
contaminated waste soils, such as those process systems shown 
in United States Patent Specification Nos. 5,128,068 (Lahoda 
et al.); 5,056,541 (Schade et al.); 4,841,998 (Bruya); and 
4,783,263 (Trost et al.). These processes typically rely upon 
size and density separatory techniques to purify the waste 
soil. The use of these techniques does not enable production 
of a cleaned sandblasting sand to environmentally acceptable 
levels because the paint chips are not easily separated from 
the sand on the basis of size or density. A need therefore exists to provide a process for the 
treatment of waste sandblasting sand that contains paint chip  
 
particles with metal contaminants. Further, the process must 
be economically competitive with other waste disposal means 
and it must be practical in design so that it can be practiced 
on location at decontamination sites. It is one of the 
objects of this invention to provide such a process. Accordingly, the present invention resides in a 
process for treating sand containing metal contaminates to 
concentrate the metal contaminants characterized by the steps:
 
   (a) providing a waste sandblasting material 
comprising sand particles of varying size, paint particles, 
and metal contaminants; (b) contacting the waste sandblasting 
material with a paint decomposer to form a sand slurry; and 
(c) separating cleaned sand particles from the sand slurry 
thereby leaving a waste sand

<CLAIMS>
A process for treating sand containing metal 
contaminants to concentrate the metal contaminants, characterized 

by the steps: 

(a) providing a waste sandblasting material 
comprising sand particles of varying particle size, paint 

particles, and metal contaminants; 
(b) contacting the waste sandblasting material 
with a paint decomposer to form a sand slurry; and 
(c) separating cleaned sand particles from the 
sand slurry thereby leaving a waste sand slurry. 
The process of claim 1 further characterized 
by attrition abrading the sand slurry of step (b), to form an 

attrition sand slurry, to break up the paint particles and to 
dislodge the paint particles from the sand particles. 
The process of claim 2 further characterized 
by size separating cleaned sand particles from the attrition 

sand slurry by countercurrent rinsing comprising introducing 
the attrition sand slurry into a separation vessel in a first 

flow direction and introducing an aqueous cleaning solution 
into the separation vessel in a second flow direction counter 

to the first flow, whereby a waste sand slurry is formed 
comprising metal contaminates and fine sand particles, which 

waste sand slurry is carried by the cleaning solution, and a 
cleaned sand slurry, passing countercurrent to the second flow 

direction, is formed comprising sand particles having a larger 
average particle size than the fine sand particles. 
The method of claim 3 further characterized by 
concentrating said metal contaminants in the waste sand slurry 

by removing cleaning solution from the waste sand slurry. 
The process of claim 4 wherein the concentrating 
step is further characterized by: 


(i) admixing a coagulation agent for the metal 
contaminant and a flocculation agent into the waste sand 

slurry to form a flocculated material and a flocculation 
solution; and 
(ii) separating the flocculated material from 
the flocculation solution. 
The process of claim 5 characterized in that 
the size separation step is conducted as a countercurrent 

mineral jig step and wherein the separation vessel is a 
mineral jig, further comprising introducing the attrition sand 

slurry into the mineral jig and introducing the cleaning 
solution at a point vertically below the attrition sand slurry 

introduction and removing the cleaned sand passing 
countercurrently to the cleaning solution at a point vertically 

below the waste sand removal point. 
The process of claim 1 characterized in that 
the paint decomposer comprises a caustic solution. 
The process of claim 7 characterized in that 
the caustic solution is a 1-10 percent by weight sodium 

hydroxide solution. 
The process of claim 1 characterized in that 
the metal contaminates comprise lead and the cleaned sand has 

a lead content below about 1000 ppm. 
The process of claim 9 characterized in that 
the cleaned sand contains less than about 5 ppm lead TCLP.
