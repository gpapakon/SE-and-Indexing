<ABSTRACT>
A wiper arm, in particular for cleaning the windshield of a motor vehicle, has a fastening part (3) having an element (9) receiving a wiper shaft (2). The element (9) is formed in a sheet metal part forming a rear part (6) and is flanked by side cheeks (7, 8) joined to the rear part (6). The element (9), the rear part (6) and the side cheeks (7, 8) are formed in a single piece on the fastening part (3). A flat design and a high torque-transmitting capability are obtained in that the edges (12, 13) of the deep-drawn fastening part (3) or the edges (13, 12) of the element (9) and of the side cheeks (7, 8) point in the direction of the vehicle windshield.

A wiper arm, in particular for cleaning the windscreen of 
an automotive vehicle, including a fastening component (3) 

having a receptacle (9) for a wiper shaft (2), which 
receptacle (9) is integrally moulded to a sheet metal 

component forming a back (6) and is flanked by side walls 
(7 and 8) connected with the back (6), with the receptacle 

(9), back (6) and side walls (7 and 8) being integrally 
moulded in one piece to the fastening component (3), and 

the edges (12 and 13) of the deep-drawn fastening component 
(3) or rather the edges (13 and 12) of the receptacle (9) 

and the side walls (7 and 8) point toward the windscreen of 
the vehicle,
 
characterised in that the receptacle (9) is formed of a 

conically widened neck (10) which is deep-drawn in the 
direction of the windscreen of the vehicle and is upset 

such that material is urged to the apex of the cone. 
A wiper arm as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterised in that the back (6) passes over in a level 

way from the side walls (7 and 8) into the receptacle (9). 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the angle of the cone of the 

receptacle (9) is slightly smaller than the cone angle of 
the conical portion of the wiper shaft (2). 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the wall thickness of the receptacle 

(9) diminishes toward the edge (13).  
 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the receptacle (9) has a cylindr
ical 
design. 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that the receptacle (9) has the shape of 

a frustrum of a cone. 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the side walls (7 and 8) extend 

beyond the receptacle (9) toward the windscreen of the 
vehicle or rather along the direction of the wiper shaft 

(2). 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the wall of the receptacle (9) is 

elastically ductile. 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the outward-pointing surfaces of the 

back (6) are designed as abutment surfaces for the 
fastening means such as a nut (5) fixing the fastening 

component (3) on the wiper shaft (2). 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the surface of the receptacle (9) 

associated with the wiper shaft (2) has a superficial 
structure.  

 
A wiper arm as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the fastening component (3) consists 

of an aluminium alloy.
