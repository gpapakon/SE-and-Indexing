<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to functional 
polymers and their production. More particularly, it 
relates to polymers comprising a main chain of carbon-carbon 
bonds and a functional group as a pendant to the main chain, 
said functional group being characteristic in connecting to 
the main chain with intervention of a carbonyliminocarbonyl 
linkage (-CONHCO-). In recent years, a great number of polymers are 
artificially produced and used in various fields, and there 
are always demands to new polymers having better, enhanced 
or improved physical properties. As a result of the extensive study seeking new 
polymers having excellent physical properties such as high 
elasticity, good adhesion and favorable dispersibility, it 
has now been found that polymers having a main chain of 
carbon-carbon bonds and a functional group appending thereto 
through a carbonyliminocarbonyl linkage show excellent 
physical properties attributed to the functional group and 
the carbonyliminocarbonyl linkage. Accordingly, a basic object of the present invention 
is to provide a polymer having a main chain of carbon-carbon 
bonds and a functional group appending thereto 
through a carbonyliminocarbonyl linkage. Another object of 
the invention is to provide an intermediate monomer usable 
for production of said polymer. A further object of the 
invention is to provide a process for production of said  
 
polymer. These and other objects will be apparent to those 
skilled in the art from the foregoing and subsequent descriptions. The functional polymer of the invention is a 
polymer which comprises a main chain comprising carbon-carbon 
bonds and at least one functional group appended to 
the main chain through a carbonyliminocarbonyl linkage, the 
content of the functional groups (including the carbonyliminocarbonyl 
linkage) in the polymer being from 0.1 to 99.9 
% by weight and the molecular weight of the polymer being 
from 1,000 to 100,000. Said functional polymer can be produced by two 
processes, of which one comprises polymerization of an 
alkenyl isocyanate of the formula: 
wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group (e.g. 
methyl, ethyl, propyl) optionally with one or more polymerizable 
monomers and addition of a functional group-containing 
compound having an active hydrogen atom of the 
formula:

R'-H   (II)


 
wherein R' is the residue of a functional group-containing 
compound excluding the active hydrogen atom therefrom to the 
isocyanatocarbonyl group in the resultant isocyanatocarbonyl 
group-conta
