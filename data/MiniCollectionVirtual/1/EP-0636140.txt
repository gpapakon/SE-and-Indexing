<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retro-inverted tetrapeptides 
analogues of C-reactive protein fragments 
(hereinafter CRP). 
CRP is a protein generally having very low blood 
concentration, which rises up to two thousand times 
following inflammatory process [J.J. Morley and I. 
Kushner, Am. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 389, 406-418 (1989)]. F.A. 
Robey et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262, No.15, 7053- -7057 
(1987) disclose three CRP tetrapeptide sequences very 
similar to the ones of tuftsin. The chemically 
sinthetised tetrapeptides show to stimulate the 
phagocytic leukocytes, to produce superoxide and to 
induce mononuclear cells to produce interleukin 1, in a 
qualitatively and quantitatively tuftsin-like manner. 
Like tuftsin, the three CRP tetrapeptides should be 
rapidly in vivo metabolised by proteases, and yield 
peptide metabolites which could competitively inhibit 
the biological activity/ies of the parent peptides. 
It has been now surprisingly found that partially 
modified and N-terminal retro-inverted analogues of said 
CRP tetrapeptide fragments show not only a  
 
considerable stability against the enzymatic degradation 
while maintaining the immunomodulating activity already 
seen for tuftsin (see EP-A-0 253 190), but in particular 
they are able to determine different biological effects 
depending on the structure and the dose used, 
specifically in the treatment of septic shock. Therefore 
the present invention relates to retro-inverted tetrapeptides 
of the general formula I 
 
wherein R is a hydrogen atom or the side-chain of 
threonine; R1 is the side-chain of arginine, leucine or 
glutamine; and R2 is a hydrogen atom or a metabolically 
perishable acyl group; with the proviso that when R1 is 
the side-chain of arginine, R cannot be the side-chain 
of threonine; and their diastereoisomeric forms and 
pharmacologically acceptable salts, esters and amides. Particularly, the invention relates to the retro-inverted 
tetrapeptides gGly-(R,S)mLys-Pro-Arg, gThr-(R,S)mLys-Pro-Leu, 
gThr-(R,S)mLys-Pro-Gln, wherein the 
prefixes g and m mean that the aminoacid is,  
 
respectively, a gem-diamine and malonyl residue, and the 
diastereoisomeric forms thereof. The retro-inverted tetrapeptides of the present 
invention are synthetised in accordance with known 
methods, which the skilled in the art may choose 
depending on the kind of aminoacids to retroinvert. For example, when the gem-diamine residue is the 
1,1-diaminomethane group (gGly), the retro-inverted 
tetrapeptide may be prepared by first reacting the
