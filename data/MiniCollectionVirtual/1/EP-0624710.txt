<DESCRIPTION>
One aspect of this invention relates to a foamable, oil well 
treatment fluid comprising a fluorochemical surfactant. 
Another aspect of this invention relates to a polymeric 
fluorochemical surfactant which is obtainable by polymerizing 
one or more fluorine-containing ethylenically unsaturated 
monomers and one or more fluorine-free ethylenically unsaturated 
monomers. Most oil wells produce natural gas as a byproduct. While 
natural gas may be a valuable byproduct of oil production 
in some oil fields, in many others it is a hazardous waste 
product that must be disposed of (e.g., by burning) on site 
because it cannot be economically transported from the oil 
wells to the market. Also, excess natural gas production 
from an oil well can make recovery of oil from the well 
difficult and uneconomical. This particularly may be a 
problem in "thin-rim" oil fields (i.e., those oil fields 
having an oil layer 10 to 200 meters thick) such as those 
found in the North Sea. In some such oil fields, natural 
gas production is sufficiently large to result in the 
formation of a "gas vortex" in the well during oil production. 
This condition is known as "gasconing" and generally 
adversely impacts the economic extraction of oil from such 
wells. Thus, it would be very useful to develop a method 
of reducing the natural gas production of oil wells, and 
particularly of reducing or eliminating gasconing. Various researchers have reported that foam-forming 
fluids can be injected into wells to stimulate oil 
production. (For example, see U.S. Patent Nos.  3,529,668 (Bernard et al) and 4,557,837 (Clark III et al.)). 
Clark III et al. describes the use of a foam-forming fluid 
that contains methanol and a polymeric fluorochemical having 
three or more fluorochemical moieties linked by divalent 
groups to the polymer backbone. Clark III et al. also reported at the "1979 SPE of AIME 
International Symposium on Oil Field and Geothermal Chemistry" 
held in Houston, Texas on January 22-26, 1979 that 
certain fluorochemical sufactants were useful as crude oil 
foaming agents, however none of the disclosed surfactants 
are believed to be useful in preventing gasconing. U.S. Patent No. 4,903,771 (Hanssen et al.) describes a method 
of reducing or eliminating gasconing by injection of a foam-forming 
fluid into an oil well. The fluid forms a foam in 
the well that blocks natural gas infiltration from the 
surrounding geologic strata into the oil well. Some of 
Hanssen et al.'s fluids contain water-soluble perfluoroalkanoic 
a
