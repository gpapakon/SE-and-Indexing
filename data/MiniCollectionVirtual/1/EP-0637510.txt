<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides prepregs in which thermoplastic 
resin has been impregnated into the continuous fibers aligned in one 

direction on a plane and at least one layer of porous and flexible 
reinforcing sheet has been placed in firm contact with the obtained 

fiber/resin composite having a continuous fiber content of 40 - 80 % by 
volume. 
According to the present invention, partial unevenness in 
strength can be prevented. Three-dimensional shaping can be carried out 

without impairing strength. Further, weight per unit surface can be 
reduced as required without impairing desirable performance 

characteristics. In addition, the materials of the invention can be 
bonded with other materials without applying any special surface 

treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic 
resin prepreg. Such a prepreg is, desirably, light in weight, 
excellent in both mechanical strength and forming characteristics 
and is in particular for use in the fields of automobile 
components such as bumper back-up beams, door beams, sheet 
shells, interior cell materials, and door trims; and construction 
materials such as concrete frames and temporary scaffolding 
structures for workers and the like, mechanical components such 
as mechanism members, covers and the like. The present invention 
also relates to a laminated structure and a formed article using 
said prepreg and methods for the production of the same. In the prior art, such large-sized resin articles have been 
produced by forming fiber-reinforced thermosetting resins to a desired 
shape. However, the thermosetting resins are such lower molecular 
weight polymers that they smell like a styrene monomer in the 
production processes when they are unsaturated polyester resins and 
they smell like amines when they are epoxy resins. Such odors pose 
noxious problems to humanbodies. Further, during prepreg-stacking operation, resin layers and 
fiber layers are likely to slide from their right place to form 
wrinkles since they are not fully integrated. Thus, the forming  
 
process of this material requires considerable skills. A considerable 
length of time is required to complete curing of the formed articles. 
This method of forming articles, therefore, requires skilled labors and 
environmental protection measures, resulting in higher production 
costs. Therefore, for the past years, an attempt has been made to 
manufacture articles using more easily treatable thermoplastic resin. Generally, those articles formed using thermoplastic resin are 
prepared by heating laminate structures to a resin softening or fluidal 
temperature or higher and then stamping the softened laminate 
structures in a compression mold for a final article. Said laminate 
structures can be formed by stacking a plural of fiber-reinforced resin 
sheets, while changing their fiber directions successively, that have 
been obtained by impregnating thermoplastic resin into the continuous 
fibers oriented in one direction on a plane, and heating and compressing 
simultaneously. However, those conventional fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin 
articles tend to have a non-uniform distribution of mechanical strength 
even when the articles are virtually of a shape of plane because the 
continuous fibers used for
