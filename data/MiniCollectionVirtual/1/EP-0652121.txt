<ABSTRACT>
According to the tire air-pressure reduction detecting 
apparatus and method of the present invention, when a vehicle 

actually travels, the detected rotational angular speeds F
i
 of 
the tires W
i
 are multiplied by correction coefficients C
i
 to 
correct the initial differences (Step N2), the vehicle speed 

V₀ is calculated based on rotational angular speeds F
i0
 thus 
obtained (Step N3), and the speed V₀ is put in a formula of 

relationship f(V) to obtain a front/rear wheel ratio f(V₀) 
corresponding to the speed V₀ (Step N4). Based on the 

front/rear wheel ratio f(V₁) corresponding to a speed V₁ 
at which the correction coefficients C
i
 have been obtained, 
and the front/rear wheel ratio f(V₀), there is obtained a 

variation of the front/rear wheel ratio f(V₀)/f(V₁), by which 
rotational angular speeds F₃, F₄ are then multiplied (Step 

N5). The products are put in a judging formula for detecting a 
reduction in the air pressure of a tire W
i
, thereby to 
calculate a judgement value D. When D satisfies the following 

conditions:


D 
<
 - D
TH1
 or D 
>
 D
TH2



 
it is judged that there is a tire W
i
 reduced in air pressure. 
Such a processing eliminates the influence of speed 
variations or forward/backward acceleration, such that the 

rotational angular speeds of the front and rear tires can be  
 

obtained more accurately. It is therefore possible to detect a 
reduction in air pressure with high precision regardless of 

the vehicle speed or forward/backward acceleration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for detecting a reduction in the air pressure of
each of the tires of a four-wheeled vehicle, and more particularly
to a tire air-pressure reduction detecting method
capable of securely detecting a reduction in air pressure even
though the vehicle is under travelling, and also to a tire
air-pressure reduction detecting apparatus using this method.As one of safety devices for a four-wheeled vehicle such
as a passenger car, a truck or the like, an apparatus for
detecting a reduction in the air pressure of a tire has
recently been invented and partially put in practical use.The tire air-pressure reduction detecting apparatus has
been developed with its importance recognized mainly for the
following reasons. If a tire is low in air pressure, the tire
is increased in flexure to raise the tire temperature. When
the tire temperature is raised, a polymeric material used for
the tire is lowered in strength. This may provoke tire
bursting. However, even though a tire is reduced in air
pressure, the driver is not aware of such a reduction. In such a detecting apparatus, there may be used, for
example, a method of detecting a reduction in air pressure
based on differences among the rotational angular speeds F1,
F2, F3, F4 (hereinafter collectively referred to as
"rotational angular speeds Fi") of the four tires W1, W2, W3,
W4 (in which the tires W1, W2 respectively correspond to the
front left and right wheels, while the tires W3, W4
respectively correspond to the rear left and right wheels, and
which are hereinafter collectively referred to as "tires Wi").According to this method, the rotational angular speeds
Fi of the tires Wi are detected per predetermined sampling
period based on signals supplied from wheel speed sensors
attached to the tires Wi for example. When the dynamic load
radii of the tires Wi (the apparent rolling radii of the tires
as calculated by dividing, by 2π, the distances that the
vehicle advances during one rotation of the tires when the
vehicle travels) are the same as one another, the rotational
angular speeds Fi are the same as one another as far as the
vehicle linearly travels.On the other hand, the dynamic load radius of a tire Wi
varies with, for example, a change in the air pressure of the
tire Wi. The dynamic load radius of a tire Wi reduced in air
pressure becomes smaller than that of a tire normal in inner
pressure. Accordingly, the rotational angular speed Fi of this
tire Wi is faster than that of a tire normal in inner
