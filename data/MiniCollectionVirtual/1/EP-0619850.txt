<DESCRIPTION>
 PRODUCTION OF PAPER AND PAPERBOARDThis invention concerns the production of paper and paperboard. Conventional paper or paperboard manufacture involves forming a fibrous stock containing additives such as pigments, fillers and sizing agents and dewatering the stock on a metal or fabric wire to form the basis for the paper or board sheet. Such processes have been subject to the conflicting requirements that ready drainage of the stock should occur and that there should not be undue loss of additives and of fibre from the stock in the course of drainage, that is, that the retention of such additives and fibre on the wire should be high. This acts not only to give a saving in raw material costs and a reduction in the energy required to dry the sheet but also reduces effluent treatment requirements as a result of a lower content of suspended solids, and lower COD and BOD loadings, in the purge water. Sheet formation and surface properties may also be improved. There have been many attempts to optimise drainage and retention properties by the use of combinations of additives, which include polyelectrolytes such as high molecular weight polyacrylamide and its copolymers, which act as flocculants.It has been proposed to use colloidal swelling clays in conjunction with the high molecular weight, relatively low charge density polyacrylamides which have traditionally been used as flocculants, which may be non-ionic, anionic or cationic in nature and may be selected to suit the charge demand of the stock.US-A-3052595, for example, discloses the addition of bentonite to filled stock followed by an acrylamide homopolymer or copolymer which may include at most about 15% by weight of a functional comonomer which may be anionic or cationic in nature, corresponding to a charge density of at most about 2 m.eq./g. The affect of the above combination is that the polymer and the bentonite "are mutually activating whereby increased retention of the filler in the paper web and decreased turbidity of the resulting white water are obtained".More recently, EP-A-0017253 disclosed that the fibre retention and dewatering properties of substantially filler-free stocks may be improved dramatically by including in the stock a high molecular weight polyacrylamide and a bentonite-type clay. The polyacrylamide may contain 

 not more than 10% of either cationic or anionic units and is limited thereby to low charge density material.US-A-4753710 and US-A-4913775 disclose a process, the Hydrocol process, comprising adding a high molecular

Claims
1. A process for the manufacture of paper or paperboard comprising the steps of forming an aqueous cellulosic suspension, passing the cellulosic suspension through one or more shear stages, draining the suspension to form a sheet and drying the sheet, wherein the cellulosic suspension that is drained includes organic polymeric material and inorganic material, wherein said organic polymeric material is a flocculant having a molecular weight above 500,000 and is added to the suspension before one of the said shear stages and wherein said inorganic material comprises bentonite which is added to the suspension after that shear stage, characterised in that the organic polymeric material comprises an anionic or non-ionic polymer.
2. A process as claimed in claim 1 , wherein the organic polymeric material is an anionic polymer.
3. A process as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the organic polymeric material is a polymer of acrylamide and/or methacrylamide monomers.
4. A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the polymer is a copolymer of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid monomers.
5. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cellulosic suspension is treated with a cationic donor before the suspension is treated with the organic polymeric material.
6. A process as claimed in claim 1 , wherein, before the cellulosic suspension is treated with the organic polymeric material, the suspension carries an anionic demand.
7. A process as described with reference to the examples.
