<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a projectile (1a) with a casing (2) enclosing an HE charge (4) and an impact fuze (7), the impact fuze (7) comprising a fixed element (9) integral with the outer wall and a percussion element (11) which moves longitudinally with respect to the casing. In order to simplify the design of the projectile, increase its effectiveness and improve the safety of operation, the percussion element (11) of the impact fuze (7) is formed by a component which surrounds the HE charge (4), this component being secured in its normal position by a frictionally or physically interlocking retention system designed as a rated release point.
