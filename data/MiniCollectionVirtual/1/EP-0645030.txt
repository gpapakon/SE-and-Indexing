<ABSTRACT>
A power management arrangement of a computerized portable data collection terminal includes a high speed data bus (50) which couples functional modules of the terminal via a plurality of microprocessor devices. The microprocessor devices interact to control selective activation of communication circuits to perform necessary communication or data processing functions and enter a power saving-dormant state during other times. Power savings are further realized from assigning control and monitoring functions to control processor (49) of a terminal module and data processing operations to high speed application microprocessor (48) with substantial computing power. Upon occurrence of an event requiring data processing operations, the application processor is activated, performs needed operations and is immediately deactivated to conserve power when not actively engaged in data processing functions. Typical data processing functions may include interpreting raw data from scanning operations, acting on keyboard inputs, performing data base operations and updating display screen information.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PORTABLE DATA PROCESSOR WHICH SELECTIVELY ACTIVATES AND DEACTIVATES INTERNAL MODULAR UNITS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR TOCONSERVE POWERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to portable data collection and data processing apparatus, and more particularly to microprocessor operated circuits for controlling the operation of such5 apparatus.Portable, hand-held electronic data processing units have taken on an increasingly significant role in business control systems. Battery powered, hand-held data collection terminal units are used10 for inventory control in warehousing and merchandising operations. Other uses of such terminal units include invoicing, delivery route and order taking operations, and fast check-out and return control in automobile rental operations.15 Portable terminal units may typically include radio communications modules which maintain a real time communication link with a host computer and hence with a comprehensive business system.Certain limitations affecting the use of these20 terminal units relate to communication route loading, namely to the limited number of terminal units which may conveniently become linked to a host over the same communication channel, or at best over a limited number of channels. Multiplexing and time25 slot access protocols typically establish upper limits for the number of data terminal units in any one system. To accommodate a larger number of terminals within any one system radio access becomes a premium. Data manipulation and compression prior30 to transmission and on-board data storage may be 

implemented to increase data transmission rates and reduce access requirements. Typically, increased data processing capabilities are also accompanied by comparative increases in power consumption. In a hand-held, portable data collection and processing terminal an increased power consumption is, however, undesirable because of a resulting shorter operating cycle between battery recharge operations. Power saving improvements for such hand-held units are therefore highly desirable and are the subject of development effort.Many diverse uses of hand-held terminal units or apparatus in present day business systems would ideally require a great number of distinct models of the terminals, each having a specific configuration tailored to one of the many particular uses. When changes in the hardware configurations of data collection terminals are implemented to meet specific needs, the manufacturing costs of the respective terminals tend to increase

IN THE CLAIMS;
1. In a portable data collection terminal unit, a data communication and processing arrangement comprising: a plurality of distinct functional units each unit performing a predetermined function including keyboard input signalling, display screen data presentation, data processing, battery power monitoring, radio transceiver data transmissions and receptions; means for communicating data messages among the distinct functional units, the communication means including terminal elements at each of the functional units; and means for selectively activating the terminal elements at two of the functional units for communicating data between the two functional units and for deactivating the activated terminal elements upon conclusion of the communication of data between the two functional units.
2. The data communication and processing arrangement according to claim 1 wherein the means for communicating data messages comprises: a control unit, the control unit being one of the distinct functional units; a data bus extending between the control unit and other of the distinct functional units; a plurality of microprocessors, each disposed at one of the other functional units and coupled to the data bus to form a data bus terminal at the respective functional unit; and a control processor disposed at the control unit, coupled to the data bus and including means for controlling communication over the data bus. 


 3. The data communication and processing arrangement according to claim 2, the control unit further comprising an application processor communicatively coupled to the control processor for performing data processing operations, the control unit further including means for deactivating the application processor at the conclusion of a data processing operation, the control processor including means for activating the application processor on the occurrence of an event requiring data processing operations by the application processor, whereby the application processor is activated intermittently solely to perform data processing operations and remains deactivated during other periods.
