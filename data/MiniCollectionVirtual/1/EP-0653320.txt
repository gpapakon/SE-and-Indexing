<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle front axle has a wheel carrier (4) guided by two transverse links (2, 3). The rear transverse link (3) is connected to a vehicle chassis (17) by means of a vertically arranged damping bush (12). This damping bush (12) has axial slots (13, 14) and, as a result, is softer in the direction of an axis (15) than transversely to the said axis. This axis (15) extends at an angle of 5 DEG  to 15 DEG  to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, being oriented forwards towards the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.

Motor vehicle front axle with a hub carrier (4) guided 
by two transverse links (2, 3), in which the rear 

transverse link (3) is connected to a fixed frame of the 
motor vehicle by means of a stationary damping bush (12) 

having different spring rates in different radial axes (15, 
16), and in which for pivoting of the hub carrier (4) a 

track rod (5) is linked to the latter, characterised in 
that the radial axis (15) of greatest softness of the 

damping bush (12) forms an acute angle with the 
longitudinal direction of the motor vehicle and is oriented 

in such a way that the instantaneous centre (8) of movement 
of the front wheel (6) caused by longitudinal forces is 

shifted towards the inner end of the track rod (5). 
Motor vehicle front axle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the damping bushes (12) of both sides 

of the vehicle are arranged in such an angular position 
that their radial axes (15) of greatest softness point out 

of a position extending in the longitudinal direction of 
the vehicle about 5 to 15Â° towards the centre of the 

vehicle. 
Motor vehicle front axle according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the damping bushes (12) to produce 

their different spring rates in different directions have 
slots (13, 14) extending in the axial direction. 
Motor vehicle front axle according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the spring travel 

of the damping bushes (12) in the direction of greatest 
softness is limited by a stop at at least one slot. 
Motor vehicle front axle according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the stop is formed by the cross-section 

of the slots (13, 14).  
 
Motor vehicle front axle according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the damping bushes (12) in the 

direction of their greatest softness have a maximum soft 
spring travel of 0 to 1 mm at at least one slot.
