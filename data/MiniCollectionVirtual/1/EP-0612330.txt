<DESCRIPTION>
 BIS-DICYANDIAMIDES AS CURING AGENTS FOR EPOXY RESINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to the curing of epoxy resins and, more particularly, to improvement of the curing agents used with epoxy resins. Dicyandiamide (also called cyanoguanidine) is well- known as a curing agent for epoxy resins, but it is also known to have a serious deficiency. It is only soluble in solvents which are undesirable, either because they are not usable in most applications, such as water, or because the solvents are relatively expensive and environmentally undesirable, such as dimethylformamide and the like.In U.S. Pat. No. 3,553,166 a curing agent is disclosed which combines a metal salt of an imidazole and another compound, which may be dicyandiamide. These curing agents are used in a one-part epoxy composition which is curable at elevated temperatures, but which can be stored at ambient temperature for long periods.Another combination of dicyandiamide with a second compound is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,311,753 where dicyandiamide is combined with tetraalkyl guanidine to provide a curing agent for mixtures of di- and tetra- functional epoxides.The reaction product of dicyandiamide with formaldehyde and an amine terminated polyether may be used to cure epoxy resins, as is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,422. A somewhat similar composition is disclosed in Japanese published patent application 61-207425 which employs an epoxy hardener combining cyanoguanidine compounds, polyethera ines, and guanide compounds. 

 Two recent published European patent applications cover certain substituted cyanoguanidines said to be useful as curing agents for epoxy resins. In EP 306,451 oligomers of substituted 3-cyanoguanidines are discussed. Such compounds are produced by the reaction of a monoisocyanate with a diisocyanate to form the oligomer, followed by reaction with cyanamide to form compounds having the formula:N-CN N-CN1 1 II 2R -[-NH-C-NH-R-]-NH -C-NH-R nThese compounds differ from those of the present inventors in that they are oligomers and both the terminal amino groups are substituted, thus reducing the functionality of these compounds. The applicants recognized the problem discussed above which is inherent with the use of dicyandiamide, namely, the need to use objectionable solvents. The new oligomeric cyanoguanidines are said to dissolve well in suitable solvents and to produce epoxy resins having a high glass transition temperature. Another published application is EP 310,545 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,761) in
