<ABSTRACT>
Blocked (cyclo)aliphatic polyisocyanate whose blocking agents are composed from 30 to 70 equivalent-% of butanone oxime, from 30 to 70 equivalent-% of 1,2,4-triazole and from 0 to 30 equivalent-% of other blocking agents, a process for their preparation by blocking paint (surface coating, lacquer, varnish, enamel) polyisocyanates using such blocking agents, optionally with prior, simultaneous or subsequent modification by means of incorporable hydrazine derivatives, and the use of the blocked polyisocyanates as crosslinking agents for organic polyhydroxyl compounds in one-component polyurethane stoving (baking) paints (surface coatings, lacquers, enamels, varnishes, finishes).

<CLAIMS>
(Cyclo)aliphatic polyisocyanates, at least 95% of the 
isocyanate groups of which are in a form blocked by 

blocking agents, and which have a content of unblocked 
and blocked isocyanate groups (calculated as NCO) of 5 

to 25 wt.% in total, characterised in that the 
blocking agents consist of 


A) 30 to 70 equivalent-% of butanone oxime, 
B) 30 to 70 equivalent-% of 1,2,4-triazole and 
C) 0 to 30 equivalent-% of other blocking agents, 
different from A) and B), 
 
the above-mentioned percentages being based on all the 

blocking agents and amounting to 100. 
Organic polyisocyanates according to claim 1, 
characterised by a content of up to 4 wt.%, based on 

the solid form of the blocked polyisocyanate, of 
chemically fixed structural units corresponding to the 

formula 

Process for the preparation of blocked polyisocyanates 
according to claims 1 and 2, optionally in a form 

dissolved in coating solvents, by reaction of a 
polyisocyanate component, optionally dissolved in 

coating solvents and consisting of at least one 
polyisocyanate having (cyclo)aliphatically bonded 

isocyanate groups and an isocyanate content of 7 to  
 

30 wt.%, with blocking agents for isocyanate groups, 
optionally before, during and/or after the blocking 

reaction, up to 20 NCO-equivalent-% of the 
polyisocyanate to be blocked being reacted in an 

isocyanate addition reaction with compounds having at 
least one carboxylic hydrazide group and at least one 

group reactive to isocyanate groups, so that the 
resulting blocked polyisocyanate contains up to 

4 wt.%, based on solid, of chemically fixed structural 
units corresponding to the formula 


 
characterised in that the blocking agents are used in 

a quantity of at least 95 equivalent-%, based on the 
NCO groups still present after the above-mentioned 

modification optionally carried out, of the 
polyisocyanate to be blocked, and that they consist, 

based on the total quantity of the blocking agents, of 

A) 30 to 70 equivalent-% of butanone oxime, 
B) 30 to 70 equivalent-% of 1,2,4-triazole and 
C) 0 to 30 equivalent-% of at least one other 
blocking agent, different from A) and B), the 

blocking agents being used in any order or as a 
mixture. 
Use of the blocked polyisocyanates according to claims 
1 and 2 as cross-linking agents for organic 

polyhydroxyl compounds in polyurethane one-component 
stoving paints.
