<ABSTRACT>
Formation of small record marks at high shape and
dimensional precision is enabled in an optical recording

medium of phase change type adapted for formation of small
record marks. Thermal stability of such small record

marks with high shape and dimensional precision is also
improved to provide a highly reliable optical recording

medium of phase change type. The optical recording medium
of the invention has a recording layer of phase change

type, and record marks with minimum length of up to 350 nm
are formed in the recording layer. The recording layer

contains Ag, In, Sb and Te as its main components. Also
provided is an optical recording medium wherein the

recording layer also contains Ge and/or N as its sub-component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical recording
medium of phase change type wherein small record marks are
formed.Highlight is recently focused on optical recording
media capable of recording information at a high density
and erasing the recorded information for overwriting. One
typical overwritable optical recording medium is phase
change optical recording medium wherein a laser beam is
directed to the recording layer to change its crystalline
state whereupon a change in reflectance by the
crystallographic change is detected for reading of the
information. The phase change optical recording media are
of great interest since the medium can be overwritten by
modulating the intensity of a single laser beam and the
optical system of the drive unit is simple as compared to
magnetooptical recording media.Most optical recording media of phase change type
used chalcogenide systems such as Ge-Te system and Ge-Sb-Te
system which provide a substantial difference in
reflectance between crystalline and amorphous states and
have a relatively stable amorphous state. It was also
recently proposed to use new compounds known as
chalcopyrites. Chalcopyrite compounds have been
investigated as compound semiconductor materials and have
been applied to solar batteries and the like. The
chalcopyrite compounds are composed of Ib-IIIb-VIb2 or
IIb-IVb-Vb2 as expressed in terms of the Groups of the
Periodic Table and have two stacked diamond structures.
The structure of chalcopyrite compounds can be readily 
determined by X-ray structural analysis and their basic
characteristics are described, for example, in Physics,
Vol. 8, No. 8 (1987), pp. 441 and Denki Kagaku
(Electrochemistry), Vol. 56, No. 4 (1988), pp. 228. Among
the chalcopyrite compounds, AgInTe2 is known to be
applicable as a recording material by diluting it with Sb
or Bi. The resulting optical recording media are
generally operated at a linear velocity of about 7 m/s.

240590/1991, 99884/1991, 82593/1991, 73384/1991, and
151286/1992. In addition to the optical recording media
of phase change type wherein chalcopyrite compounds are
used, optical recording media of phase change type wherein
AgSbTe2 phase is formed with the crystallization of the
recording layer is disclosed in JP-A 267192/1992,
232779/1992, and 166268/1994.When information is recorded on the optical
recording medium of phase change type, the entire
recording layer is first brought into crystalline state,
and then, a laser beam of high power (recording
