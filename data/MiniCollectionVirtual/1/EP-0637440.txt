<ABSTRACT>
The implant is tubular and hollow in shape and has an inner cavity (1) bounded by a peripheral wall (2) with communicating apertures (9-12). The wall has an outer surface (4) which is generally circular in shape, two solid side faces (5, 6), and upper and lower surfaces (7, 8) which have the apertures in them. The implant's outer surface has at least one anti-recoil rib (13). The implant's outer wall (2) has the general shape of a truncated cone or ovoid with its larger base situated at its first end (3), and it has outer annular ribs (13, 14, 17) at each end and in the middle, one or more of which can be toothed.

Hollow tubular intersomatic implant for stabilization 
of the vertebral column, comprising an internal cavity 

(1) delimited by a peripheral wall (2) comprising a 
generally circular cross-section external surface (4) and 

having communicating holes (9, 10, 11, 12), characterized 
in that the external surface (4) is composed of two solid 

side surfaces (5, 6) and top (7) and bottom surfaces (8) 
having said communicating holes (9, 10, 11, 12) in them, 

and in that the peripheral wall comprises at least one 
annular external rib (13) that prevent retrograde 

movement that can be interrupted. 
Implant according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the peripheral wall (2) further comprises at least 

one rotation preventing external relief. 
Implant according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the peripheral wall (2) is 

generally frustoconical or ovoidal with truncated 
longitudinal ends the larger base of which consists of 

the surface at its first end (3). 
Implant according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the peripheral wall (2) comprises a 

respective annular external rib (13, 14) near its first 
end (3) and near its second end (15). 
Implant according to claim 4, characterized in 
that it further comprises an intermediate annular 

external rib (16) in an intermediate area (17) of the 
wall in which there are no communicating holes. 
Implant according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said rotation preventing external relief comprises 

at least one tooth projecting from at least one of the 
annular external ribs (13) for preventing retrograde 

movement.  
 
Implant according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the side surfaces (5, 6) have no 

annular external ribs. 
Implant according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the side surfaces (5, 6) include a 

flat on their outside. 
Implant according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the peripheral wall (2) is joined, 

at its second end (15), to a transverse bearing wall 
(22). 
Implant according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the transverse bearing wall (22) comprises a 

threaded axial hole (23) for fitting an inserting tool. 
Implant according to claim 10, characterized 
in that the transverse bearing wall (22) includes 

external reliefs (24) for preventing rotation of the 
inserting tool relative to the implant. 
Implant according to claim 11, characterized 
in that the external reliefs (24) are shaped to 

constitute means for visually indicating the angular 
position of the implant about its longitudinal axis 

(I-I).
