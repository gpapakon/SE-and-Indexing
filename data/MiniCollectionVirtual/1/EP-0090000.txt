<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber (10) is guided along a preselected path through a coating applicator (32) by detecting its position and relocating the preform (11) from which it is being drawn whenever the fiber is detected as having drifted from the path.

 OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE FIBER DRAW GUIDING AND COATING METHOD AND APPARATUSTechnical Field This invention relates 'to methods and apparatuses for guiding and coating optical fibers as they are drawn during fiber manufacture from optical waveguide fiber preforms. Background of the Invention In the manufacture of optical waveguides a fiber is typically drawn from a symmetrically heated, rod-shaped, glassy preform with the fiber yielding a faithful replica of the preform in cross section. This is done by feeding the preform downwardly into a furnace and drawing the fiber from molten material formed at the bottom of the heated preform. The fiber is then passed downwardly through a coating applicator where a thin layer of coating material is applied to the fiber. This coating serves to prevent airborne particles from impinging upon and adhering to the surface of the just drawn glass fiber itself which would.weaken it. The coating also shields the fiber from surface defects inflicted by subsequent manufacturing processes and installation handling. The fiber is then routed through a curing oven where the coating is cured and then onto a takeup reel via system of sheaves and capstans. For a more detailed. description of such a fiber drawing process reference may be had to the article titled "Drawing Lightguide Fiber" by David H. Smithgall and Daryl L. Myres that appears on pages 49-61 of the Winter 1980 issue of THE WESTERN ELECTRIC ENGINEER.In conducting the just described fiber draw process it is important that the fiber be moved precisely along a preselected path. Deviations from this path may result in the fiber actually contacting an edge of the relatively small opening at the bottom of the furnace, which opening is purposely made quite small to minimize the 

 intake of ambient air or gases. Furthermore, deviations from the preselected path through the coating applicator may well result in the coating not being applied concentrically to the fiber. In other words, the coating may be thicker to one side or the other. If the coating is badly nonconcentric the fiber may be directly exposed to ambient atmosphere; even where the coating is only marginally nonconcentric fiber alignment for connectorization becomes poor creating significant ' transmission losses at interconnect points. In addition, where a diameter gauge is employed in the draw machine it too cannot operatively tolerate substantial misalignment the fiber.The difficulty in maintaining the movement of the fiber along a preselected path beneath the

 Claims
1. A method of guiding an optical waveguide fiber being drawn from an optical waveguide fiber preform, characterized by the steps of sensing an actual position of the fiber, comparing the sensed position with a preselected position located along a preselected path of fiber travel, and moving the preform in response to deviations in the sensed position from the preselected position so as to maintain the fiber travelling 
"
 substanially along the preselected path.
2. The method in accordance with Claim 1, characterized in that the optical fiber preform is suspended from a preform holder, and the prefo'rm is moved by movement of the preform holder. 3. The method in accordance with Claim 2, characterized in that the optica.1 fiber is suspended from the preform holder downwardly into a furnace where it is heated, and wherein the sensed actual position of the fiber is compared with a preselected position located along the preselected path of fiber travel beneath the furnace.
