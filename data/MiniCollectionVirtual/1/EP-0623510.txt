<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for applying 
corner protectors (so called 
"angle bars") to pallets. The long operative chain leading to a final 
stacking and despatch of vegetable and fruit 
produce ends with the stacking of the wooden 
crates or cartons containing the produce on 
pallets. Pallets are generally parallelepiped in shape and 
of a standardized size, and have a wooden support 
base. A whole assembly including the base and a 
predetermined number of crates stacked on them is 
normally referred to by the term pallet. Once the cartons or crates have been stacked on 
the pallet bases, a way has to be found to render 
the whole stable. This is usually done through a 
strapping operation, consisting in winding a 
stiff strap around the pallet using a strapping 
machine for a predetermined number of circuits at 
various heights. The alignment of the crates on the bases is never  
 
perfect, however, and edges may project from the 
hypothetical and ideal surface, leading to 
imperfections in the tightness of the strapping 
which, during transport of the produce, might 
cause loss of pallet stability. To obviate this occurrence, during the strapping 
operation right-angled bars, known as angle bars, 
are applied to the pallets and the strapping is 
performed around these. The above is normally a manual task and requires 
the presence of at least one person to position 
the angle bars with an elastic band or sticky 
tape, while the strapping machine performs a 
sufficient number of circuits to hold the angle 
bars in position. Obviously, this is a lengthy task and is wasteful 
of operator time. In the prior art are also known some solutions, 
disclosed in the patents FR-A-2669002 and US-A-5226280, 
in which are used mechanical devices for 
transporting the angle bars to the edges of the 
pallets. The preamble of claim 1 is based on this prior art. However, both described devices are structurally 
separated from the pallet and, in particular, the 
means for moving the angle bars are not integral  
 
with the mobile part of the strapping machine. 
This involves two disadvantages: on one side, the 
means for moving the angle bars are drived in a 
completely independent manner and they should 
generally also comprise a device to rotate the 
angle bars, since these ones, to reduce the lenght 
of their shifts, are taken from the extremity of 
the magazines, that is opposite to the pallet; on 
the other side, the overall dimensions are 
increased, because to the dimensions of the 
strapping machine

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for applying corner protectors (5) to pallets, the 
apparatus being associated to a strapping machine (1) 

having a fixed portal frame (2) and a mobile strap guide (3) 
surrounding the pallet, the apparatus further 

comprising magazines (4) for 
holding the corner protectors (5), means (6) for fixing the magazines 

(4) to the fixed portal frame (2), and means (7) for moving 
the protectors (5) in order to transport them 

from the magazines (4) to an 
application point on the pallet (19), 

characterized in that said means (7) for moving 
the protectors (5) are mounted on the mobile 

strap guide (3) in such a way as to be able to translate 
vertically together with the strap guide (3).  

 
An apparatus as in claim 1, characterized in that 
the means (7) for moving the protectors (5) 

comprise a rectangular-plan device (20) 
constituted by: 


four rods (21) arranged in pairs on two 
horizontal parallel planes;  

 
two pairs of pneumatic pistons (22), each pair 
aimed at connecting two opposing rods (21) from 

the four rods (21); 
idle support wheels (23), mobile in a guiding means (24) 
made on the mobile guide (3); 
two sliding sleeves (25) on each of said four 
rods (21); 
a plurality of sucker-bearing groups (27), 
located at a cross point of a contiguous two rods 

of said four rods (21), and hinged to facing ends 
of the sleeves (25) located on the contiguous two 

of said four rods (21). 
An apparatus as in claim 1, characterized in that 
the means (6) for fixing said frame (2) to 

a totality of said magazines (4) is constituted by 
vertical sliding guides (8). 
An apparatus as in claim 1, characterized in that 
the means (6) for fixing the fixed portal frame 

(2) to said magazines (4) comprise a fixed 
projecting rod (9) attached at a first end (10) to 

the fixed portal frame (2) and at another end (11) to 
the magazines (4).  

 
An apparatus as in claim 1, characterized in that 
the means (7) for moving the protectors (5) 

comprise at least one pneumatic cylinder (12) 
bearing at a free end (13) a vertical support (14) 

provided with at least two suckers (15) connected 
to a vacuum generator (16), which at least two 

suckers (15) determine a gripping and a releasing 
of the protectors (5). 
An apparatus as in claim 1, characterized in that 
it is adapted to apply two protectors (5) in a partially-overlapping 

fashion to each edge of a pallet (19), 
so as to increase a final rigidity of the pallet. 
An apparatus as in claim 2, characterized in that 
the sleeves (25) exhibit a skate (26) for 

contacting the pallet (19). 
An apparatus as in claim 2, characterized in that 
each sucker-bearing group (27) comprises:
