<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
fiber-reinforced composite materials. More particularly,
this invention relates to a process for producing fiber-reinforced
composite materials which are stable in the
quality and have a good colored-surface appearance.Heretofore, fiber-reinforced composite materials,
which are synthetic resins, such as thermoplastic or
thermosetting resins, reinforced by reinforcing fibers,
have been employed as materials for use in the fields of
parts of automobiles, light electrical appliances and other
industrial products, construction materials, household
articles and the like. They have been particularly
utilized for those products which are required to have high
strength and rigidity and good durability and dimensional
stability.Of these composite materials, fiber-reinforced
composite materials comprising a thermoplastic resin and
reinforcing fibers have been produced by the following
processes:
a) a process as disclosed. for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications
Nos 61-44930 and 62-57428, in which a reinforcing fiber mat is impregnated with a
thermoplastic resin which is in a molten state, followed by pressing and cooling to obtain
a composite material (lamination);b) a process as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No 49-29947
and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No 59-49929 in which a particulate
thermoplastic resin and reinforcing fibers are blended, and the resulting blend is made into
a web, followed by heating, pressing and cooling to obtain a composite material (dry
forming); andc) a process as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications
Nos 57-28135, 60-158227, 60-158228 and 1-318045, in which a particulate
thermoplastic
resin and reinforcing fibers are blended in water or in an
aqueous foam, and the resulting blend is made into a web by
the paper-making method, followed by heating, pressing and
cooling to obtain a composite material (wet forming).In any of the above processes a) to c), it is
necassary to add a variety of additives and colorants or
pigments depending upon the use of the resulting composite
material.With the above lamination process for the
production of fiber-reinforced composite materials, it is
relatively easy to obtain composite materials with various
formulations and with various colors. This is because, in
such a process, a colored thermoplastic resin to which an
additive and the like are added in advance is melted in an
extruder or the like, or after a thermoplastic resin

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a fiber-reinforced composite material which comprises uniformly mixing
and dispersing thermoplastic resin particles and reinforcing fibers in water or in an

aqueous foam to obtain a dispersion, dehydrating the resulting dispersion to form a web

characterised in that the thermoplastic resin is in the form of porous resin particles having
open pores.
The process according to claim 1, wherein the
porous resin particles have a porosity of 25 to 80 vol%.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
porous resin particles have a mean pore opening size of

0.1 to 20 µm.
The process according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the thermoplastic resin is polypropylene.
The process according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the reinforcing fibers are glass fibers.
The process according to claim 5, wherein the
glass fibers have a length of 3 to 50 mm and a diameter

of 3 to 25 µm.
The process according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the blend ratio of the thermoplastic

resin to the reinforcing fibers is 30 - 90% by weight to
70 - 10% by weight.
The process according to claim 7, wherein the
blend ratio of the thermoplastic resin to the reinforcing

fibers is 50 - 80% by weight to 50 - 20% by weight.
The process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the porous resin particles have been

coated with an additional matter selected from an
additive, a modifier, a pigment, and a mixture thereof.
The process according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein an additional matter selected from an

additive, a modifier, a pigment and a mixture thereof is
added upon the blending of the thermoplastic resin and

the reinforcing fibers.
The process according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the web formed is impregnated with a

dispersion containing an additional matter selected from
an additive, a modifier, a pigment and a mixture thereof,

followed by drying.
The process according to any one of claims 9 to
11, wherein the amount of the additional matter is from

0.3 to 20 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the
total of the thermoplastic resin and the reinforcing

fibers.
