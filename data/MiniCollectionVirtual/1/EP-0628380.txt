<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holding device for 
holding a 
lens workpiece when an ophthalmic lens is formed. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a holding 
device for holding an ophthalmic lens, which is usable 
in cutting device for ophthalmic lens in which the optical 
center of an eyesight correction region is eccentric to 
the geometric center of the outer circumferential circle 
of the lens (i.e. a decentered ophthalmic lens). Generally, in an ophthalmic lens such as a contact 
lens, a lens put in an eyelid, the shape of the lens is 
determined so that the optical center of an eyesight 
correction region coincides with the geometric center of 
the outer circumferential circle of the lens. When the 
ophthalmic lens is finished, a lens supporting device is 
used wherein a lens workpiece is supported so that the 
center axis of the lens workpiece coincides with the 
center axis of cutting, and the lens workpiece is rotated 
around the center axis of the lens workpiece while the  
 
lens surface is finished by a cutting tool (cutting bit). A study for an ophthalmic lens in recent years has 
revealed that in consideration of the shape of a cornea 
or the center position of a pupil, it is sometimes 
effective to deflect the optical center of the eyesight 
correction region from the geometric center of the outer 
circumferential circle of the lens. For instance, when a contact lens is fitted to an 
eye, the lens is apt to move toward the ear because the 
radius of curvature of the front surface of the cornea is 
larger than the radius of curvature of a portion near the 
ear. Further, the center of the pupil is deflected 
toward the nose with respect to the center of the cornea. 
Accordingly, it is sometimes desirable that the optical 
center of the eyesight correction region should be 
slightly deflected toward the nose with respect to the 
geometric center of the outer circumferential circle of 
the lens. However, in order to prepare a decentered ophthalmic 
lens with use of a conventional holding device, 
it was necessary to determine the position of 
the holding device by turning the entirety of the holding 
device so as to face the cutting tool. The position-determining 
operations was extremely difficult and was 
not practical. Use of a non-spherical lens producing apparatus is 
proposed in U.S.P. 5,195,407 wherein control is made to a  
 
cutting tool so that the cutting tool is moved close to 
and away from a lens workpiece depending on a rotation 
angle of the lens

A holding device for holding an ophthalmic lens (78) in a cutting machine, 
which holds rotatably a lens workpiece around a center axis of cutting, the 

holding device comprising: 

a lens holding member (24), to which the lens workpiece is to be fitted, having 
a spherical sliding surface, 
a support member (16) having a spherical receiving surface by which the 
spherical sliding surface of the lens holding member is supported slidably on 

the spherical receiving surface, and 
fixing means for determining a position of sliding of the lens holding member 
(24) with respect to the support member (16);
 
characterized in that: 


said fixing means comprises: 

a position-determining extension (62) formed in the lens holding member (24), 
a guide member (58) having a guide hole (64) whose center is eccentric to a 
support center axis (18) of the holding device, the guide member (58) being 

rotatable around the support center axis (18) which is in parallel to the center 
axis (N) of cutting for the lens workpiece, and 
work pins (70) which are disposed in the support member (16) movably in a 
direction perpendicular to the support center axis (18), and each of which has  

 
an outer end in contact with the inner circumferential surface of the guide hole 

(64) of the guide member (58) and an inner end in contact with the position 
determining extension (62) of the lens holding member (24); and 
a balance hole (66) is formed in the guide member (58) at a position in 
symmetric with the guide hole (64) with respect to the support center axis (18), 

and 
mass members (76) are disposed in the guide member (58) so as to be guided 
in directions opposite the moving direction of the work pins (70) by means of 

the inner circumferential surface of the balance hole (66).
