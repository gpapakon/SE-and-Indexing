<ABSTRACT>
An arterial biopsy catheter (10) for obtaining a biopsy sample from the inner layers of an artery includes an outer tube (16) and an inner tube (22) slidingly mounted within the outer tube (16). The inner tube (22) is formed with a closed distal end (58) having a beveled opening (60). The outer tube (16) is formed with an open distal end having a sharpened edge (40) to cut arterial material (76) in contact with the beveled opening (60) by sliding the outer tube (16) over the inner tube (22). The inner tube (22) and outer tube (16) are attached to handles (18, 24). In use, a vacuum is applied through the inside diameter of the inner tube (22) to the beveled opening (60), to draw arterial material (76) into contact with the beveled opening (60). The outer tube (16) is then manipulated to sever the arterial material (76) to form the biopsy sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to medical instruments for
extracting a biopsy specimen and more particularly to a
catheter for insertion into an artery for obtaining a tissue
sample from an arterial wall of a living being.Various cardiovascular catheters are well known in
the art for performing different diagnostic and
interventional medical procedures. In general most
cardiovascular catheters include a slender flexible tube that
is inserted into an artery of a patient and guided to an
access site that allows the medical procedure to be
performed.As an example, an angioplasty catheter is used in a
medical procedure in which an inflatable balloon is used to
widen a stenotic segment of an artery. As another example,
atherocatheters are used to perform another medical procedure
known as atherectomy. This procedure cuts away the stenoses
and then removes the pieces of plaque which comprised the
stenosis from the artery using a vacuum source directed
through the catheter.Medical devices for obtaining a biopsy of different
body structures such as the heart, muscles, intestines, and
the uterus are also well known in the art. U.S. Patent No.
3,606,878 to Kellogg, for instance, discloses an early
instrument for extracting a biopsy specimen from different
regions of the body such as the lungs, chest cavity liner,
heart sac or other internal organs.U.S. Patent No 4,961,430 to Sheahon discloses a
cervical biopsy instrument. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,708,147 to
Haaga, U.S. Patent No 4,640,296 to Schnepp-Pesch et al, and
U.S. Patent No 4,620,547 to Boebel disclose particular needle
structures for biopsy cannulas.Other biopsy devices are disclosed in U.S. Patents
Nos. 4,850,373; 4,903,709; 4,953,559; 4,617,940; 4,099,518;
and 4,873,991. Finally a medical instrument known in the art 
as a Schulz-Cave bioptome is an endomyocardial biopsy device
for removing a biopsy sample from the heart.In general, however, even though biopsy instruments
are well known in the art there are no prior art biopsy
instruments that are specifically adapted to obtaining a
biopsy sample which comprises a segment of arterial wall. An
arterial wall is a relatively thin structure. Consequently
the possibility of a full-thickness puncture and a resultant
hemorrhage exists.Some of the above cited biopsy catheters, such as the
Schulz-Caves bioptome, will remove a segment of tissue in a
plane generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the
catheter. As is apparent, such an arrangement would be
ineffective for use on a thin walled vessel or a long narrow
artery.

<CLAIMS>
A catheter (10) for insertion into an artery for
obtaining a tissue sample from an arterial wall of a living

being comprising;

a substantially flexible outer tube (12) formed with
an open distal end having a sharpened edge (40);
a substantially flexible inner tube (14) slidably
mounted within the outer tube (12) and having a closed distal

end (58) and an opening (60) formed to an inside lumen
thereof;
means (66) for applying a vacuum through the opening
(60) in the distal end of the inner tube (22);
means (18, 24) for moving the sharpened edge (40) of
the outer tube (12) over the opening (60) in the inner tube

(14) to cut a tissue sample with the tissue sample retained
within the opening (60) and protected by the outer tube (12)

for withdrawing the tissue sample from the artery;
the means for applying the vacuum being operable
independently of the means (18, 24) for moving the

sharpened edge (40) over the opening (60), such that the
means for applying the vacuum are suitable for drawing tissue

into contact with the opening (60).
A catheter as claimed in claim 1 and wherein the
opening (60) in the inner tube has a beveled exterior surface

(64) to form an area for contact with the tissue that is
larger than an aperture (68) of the opening (60) to the

inside of the inner tube (14).
A catheter as claimed in claim 1 or 2 and wherein the
means (18, 24) for moving the sharpened edge (40) of the

outer tube (12) over the opening (60) in the inner tube (14)
includes a handle (18) attached to the outer tube (12).
A catheter as claimed in one of the preceding claims
and wherein the means for moving the sharpened edge (4o) of 

the outer tube (12) over the opening (60) in the inner tube
(14) includes a handle (24) attached to the inner tube (14).
A catheter as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims and wherein the means for applying a vacuum includes a

tube fitting (66) in fluid communication with the inside
of the inner tube (14).
A catheter as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims the distal end of the inner tube (14) comprising a

suction tip (26) carrying the closed distal end (58) and
including the opening (60) in fluid communication with the

inside diameter of the inner tube (14) with the opening (60)
formed with an outer periphery (69) on an outer surface of

the inner tube (14) and with the opening (60) larger than an
aperture (68) to the inside lumen thereof.
A catheter according to any one of the preceding
claims, the distal end of the outer tube (12) comprising a

cutter tip (20) carrying the open distal end sized to slide
over the inner tube (14) and cut tissue in contact with the

opening (60) in the inner tube (14).
A catheter as claimed in claim 7 and wherein the
cutter tip (20) is formed of metal.
A catheter as claimed in any of the preceding claims
and wherein the outer tube (12) is formed of a polymeric

material.
A catheter as claimed in claim 6 and wherein the
suction tip (26) is formed of metal.
A catheter as claimed in claim 10 and wherein the
inner tube (14) is formed of a polymeric material.
A catheter as claimed in any of the preceding claims
and wherein the inner tube (14) is reinforced with a larger

diameter tubing (46) at a proximal end (42) and the outer
tube handle (18) slides over the larger diameter tubing (46).
