<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition
preferably having high-speed polymerizability and a
plastic lens obtained therefrom. The lens obtained
from the composition of the present invention has a
refractive index (nd) of at least 1.59.Plastic lenses are lightweight and non-fragile
compared with inorganic glass lenses so that they are
finding rapidly increasing utility as eyeglass lenses,
camera lenses or optical elements in recent years.Resins widely employed these days for such purposes
include a radical polymerization product of
diethylene glycol bis(allylcarbonate) (for example,
"CR-39", trade name; product of PPG). This resin has
various advantages such as excellent impact resistance,
lightweight, superb dyeability, and good workability
such as good cutting and grinding machinability. Its
refractive index, however, is 1.50 which is lower than
the refractive index (1.52) of inorganic glass. To obtain
optical characteristics comparable with those of a 
glass lens, it is necessary to increase the refractive
index of the plastic lens, which unavoidably increases
its central thickness or peripheral thickness, resulting
in an overall large thickness. There is accordingly
an outstanding desire for the development of a lens
resin having a still higher refractive index.The present inventors have already proposed a
plastic lens made of a sulfur-containing urethane resin
which can be prepared by the polymerization of a
polyisocyanate and a polythiol (Japanese Patent Publication
No. 15249/1992). The resin has a high refractive
index (nd) of 1.57 or higher and also has various
advantages like CR-39 so that it is used widely now.
The resin, however, is accompanied with the problem
that it requires long polymerization time and any attempt
to complete the polymerization in a short time
tends to result in a lens with optical unevenness
(striae).With a view toward improving the thermal deformation
temperature, the present inventors have also proposed
a composition which contains, in addition to the
sulfur-containing urethane resin, a hydroxyl- or
mercapto-containing acrylate, methacrylate or styrene
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 96208/1989). When a
lens resin is prepared using the composition, it has an 
improved thermal deformation temperature. When
polymerized at a high speed, however, the resin composition
develops optical unevenness (striae) and in
addition, cannot always provide a sufficient refractive
index.A composition capable of providing a plastic lens
with an improved thermal deformation temperature
