<ABSTRACT>
This machine is provided with stations (21) for receiving these bottles, with a fixed station (6) for separating the tubes (5) coming from a reel, means for transferring the separated tubes, which machine is characterized in that the transfer means comprise, on the one hand, a suction device (9) provided at the fixed station (6) for holding the separated tubes (5) against this device, by means of suction, and, on the other hand, suction devices (10) provided on the circulation path of the bottles in order to be continuously movable with it, these devices being arranged so that each tube from the fixed station is carried along the line by a suction device (10) of a station for receiving a bottle.

Machine for applying sleeve labels on 
bottles, provided with regularly distributed 

stations (2
1
) for receiving these bottles, a fixed 
station (6) for separating the sleeves (5) coming 

from a reel of sleeves, this station being 
disposed above the path of the stations receiving 

the bottles, and means for transferring each of 
the separated sleeves onto a bottle at a receiving 

station, the machine being characterised in that 
the transfer means comprise, on the one hand, a 

suction device (9) provided on the fixed station 
(6) to hold, by suction, the sleeves (5) which 

have successively been separated from the reel of 
sleeves, against this device, and, on the other 

hand, suction devices (10), provided on the path 
of circulation of the bottles to be continuously 

in motion with the path, each of these suction 
devices being located above a station (2
1
) for 
receiving a bottle, these suction devices (9, 10) 

of the fixed station and of the path of 
circulation, being arranged such that each sleeve 

that is held, successively, by the suction device 
(9) of the fixed station, is entrained, to unwind 

it, in the course of the displacement of the path 
of circulation, by a suction device (10) of a 

station for receiving a bottle, means being  
 

provided to extend, transversely, each entrained 
sleeve and to transfer it, by vertical 

displacement by means of a suction plate of the 
path of circulation, onto a bottle disposed at a 

fixed station. 
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the path of circulation of 

the bottles is in the shape of a barrel entrained 
in continuous rotation. 
Machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the barrel comprises 

radially directed arms, each arm comprising, at 
its end, a station (2
1
) for receiving a bottle. 
Machine according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

suction devices (9, 10) are in the form of suction 
surfaces. 
Machine according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the suction surfaces are in 

the form of combs, the teeth (10
1
) of the comb of 
the path of circulation of the bottles passing, 

successively, in the course of its displacement, 
the spaces formed between the teeth (9
1
) of the  
 

comb (9) of the fixed station (4) to entrain, each 
time, a sleeve label. 
Machine according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that each 

station receiving a bottle comprises a counter-suction 
device (11) mounted in a mobile manner in 

relation to the suction device (10) of this 
receiving station, in order to open the sleeves 

(5) by spacing out the suction device and the 
counter suction device. 
Machine according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the means 

for transferring the sleeves separated from the 
bottles comprises, at each station (2
1
) for 
receiving a bottle, gripping members (13, 16
1
, 16
2
) 
which can be moved vertically and as regards 

spacing in order to draw the sleeves out 
transversely and to wrap them onto the bottles. 
Machine according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the gripping members are 

formed of pincers (31).
