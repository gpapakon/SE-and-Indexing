<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a meshing blade type
batch kneader used in mixing polymeric materials, e.g.,
rubber materials.A batch type kneader is generally used in a
so-called master batch process for making the physical
properties of different types of materials even, in
which compounding agents such as carbon, and oil are
mixed with polymeric materials which are raw materials
of tire products and general industrial products.Tangential type kneaders and meshing type
kneaders, examples of which are shown in Figs. 19
through 22, are known as this type of batch kneader.A kneader shown in Fig. 19 will be hereinafter
referred to as a first conventional example. This first
conventional example is disclosed in Unexamined Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. SHO 63-136908. In this
example, a kneading chamber 22 is formed in a closed
interior enclosed by a casing 21 and an end frame, not
shown. A pair of wing rotors 23 are disposed in the 
chamber 22 parallel to each other in such a way as to
rotate in opposite directions. A communicating path 24
is formed between the rotors 23 so as to extend over
almost the entire length of the chamber 22. A hopper 25
for feeding materials is formed at an upper part of the
chamber 22 along the center line of the chamber 22 that
corresponds to the communicating path 24. A ram 26 for
forcing materials is removably fitted to an upper part
of the hopper 25, and an exhaust port 27 for mixed
materials is formed at a lower part of the chamber 22.
A door 28 is removably fitted to the exhaust port 27.A main wing and an aileron, neither shown, are
attached to each of the rotors 23, and the aileron is
arranged in such a manner as to be synchronized with the
main wing of the respective rotor at the center of the
rotor.A kneader shown in Fig. 20 (a second
conventional example) is disclosed in Unexamined
Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 63-306006. The main
construction of this kneader is the same as that of the
first example shown in Fig. 19, but a plurality of pins
29 are provided around barrel wings of both rotors 28.
This increases the capacity for taking materials into
the chamber 22. A
generic batch type
kneader (a third conventional example) shown
in Figs. 21 and 22 is disclosed in the documents JP-B-63 001 093 and
GB-A-2 028 153.
The main
construction of this kneader is the same as that of the
first conventional example shown in Fig. 19. A ratio of
the length L of the rotor 23 to an inner diameter D of
the chamber is set to 1.25 ± 0.1; a ratio ℓ/L of the
length ℓ of a main wing
