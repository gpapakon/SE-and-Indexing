<ABSTRACT>
A system for synchronizing input video signals from a plurality of video sources comprises a plurality of buffering units (B1..BN) each coupled to receive respective one of the input video signals. The buffering units have mutually independent read and write oerations. Each buffer write operation is locked to the corresponding video input signal. Each buffer read operation is locked to a system clock. The buffering units are substantially smaller than required to store a video signal field. The system further comprises a storage arrangement (DRAM-1..DRAM-M) for storing a composite signal composed from the input video signals, and a communication network (110) for communicating data from the buffering units to the storage arrangement, pixel (X) and line (Y) addresses of the buffering units and of the storage arrangement being coupled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to multi-source video synchronization.Several unrelated video signals cannot be processed correctly in a single
video effects system or displayed on a monitor, without being synchronized first. Namely,
each video signal contains line and field synchronization pulses, which are converted to
horizontal and vertical deflection signals of a monitor on which the video signal is
displayed. The major problem is that the line and field synchronization pulses contained in
the different video signals do not occur at the same time. If one of the video signals is
used as reference signal, that is the horizontal and vertical deflection signals for a display
are derived from this signal, then the following artifacts may appear:
Images that are represented by the other video signals (called the subsignals) will
be shifted spatially on the display with regard to the reference signal.Odd and even video fields in the subsignals may be interchanged which gives rise
to visual artifacts like jagged edges and line flicker.In case line and field frequencies of the video subsignals differ from the reference
video signal, then the images represented by these subsignals will crawl across the screen.Finally, so-called cut-line artifacts may become visible, i.e. different parts of the
same displayed image originate from different field/frame periods, which can be rather
annoying in moving images where some parts of moving objects seem to lag behind.Traditionally, video synchronizers are built with frame stores that are
capable to delay video signals from a few samples to a number of video frame periods.
One of these video signals is selected as a reference signal and is not delayed. All samples
of the other signals are written into frame stores (one store per signal) as soon as the start
of a new frame is detected in these signals. When the start of a new frame in the
reference video signal is detected, the read-out of the frame memory is initiated. This
way, the vertical synchronization signals contained in the reference and other video signals
appear at the same time at the outputs of the synchronization module.Fig. 1 illustrates synchronization of a video signal with a reference video
signal using a FIFO. Fig. 1 shows two independent video signals with their vertical (field) 
synchronization pulses FP, and the location of read and write pointers in a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) frame store. When a complete frame store is used, all the
artifacts mentioned above can be eliminated. At instants SW (at the end of

A system for synchronizing input video signals from a plurality of video
sources, characterized by comprising:


means for buffering (B1..BN) each respective one of said input video
signals with mutually independent read and write operations, each write operation being

locked to the corresponding video input signal, each read operation being locked to a
system clock, said buffering means (B1..BN) comprising a plurality of buffering units

each corresponding to one of said video input signals and being substantially smaller than

means for storing (DRAM-1..DRAM-M) a composite signal composed from
the buffered input video signals; and
means for communicating (110) data from said buffering units (B1..BN) to
said storing means (DRAM-1..DRAM-M), pixel (X) and line (Y) addresses of said

buffering means (B1..BN) and of said storing means (DRAM-1..DRAM-M) being

A synchronizing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said pixel (X) and
line (Y) addresses of said buffering means and of said storing means are coupled to

receive common pixel (X) and line (Y) count signals.
A synchronizing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said storing means
comprise a plurality (M) of storage units (507) having mutually independent write

controllers which are individually connectable (511) to said buffering means.
A synchronizing system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a buffer

read control arrangement comprising for each buffering unit (B1..BN) a counter for
signalling whether the buffering unit is empty to disable buffer read out.
A synchronizing system as claimed in claim 4, wherein said storing means

control arrangement is adapted to furnish data segments which are slightly larger than the
number (L) of pixels per video line divided by the number (M) of storage units contained

in said storage means (DRAM-1..DRAM-M). 
A synchronizing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said storage means
comprise a circular memory having a capacity sufficient for one video field but too small

to contain two video fields, and wherein a write address of said storage means is moved
up by one field during a vertical blanking period when a read address of said storage

means is about to pass said write address.
A synchronizing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said storage means
comprise a circular memory having a capacity sufficient for two video fields but too small

to contain three video fields, and wherein a write address of said storage means is moved
up by one frame during a vertical blanking period when a read address of said storage

means is about to pass said write address.
