<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a disposable self-prepping electrode (10) which utilizes an array or mat of flexile tines (24) which serve to part the high impendance outer layers of skin to expose the low impendance, blood enriched layers without scratching or abrading. The tines (24) are preferably imbedded in a conductive gel layer (14). In an alternate embodiment, a self-prepping layer of flexile tines (24) embedded in gel (14) may be a single disposable self-prepping layer that is mounted over a permanent electrode (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrode as set forth in the preamble of claim 1 for use in
monitoring electrical body signals and more particularly to
a disposable, pre-gelled, self-prepping electrode. Furthermore, the invention relates to a removable self-prepping layer for use with a monitoring electrode.Disposable electrodes applied to the skin are used
extensively in the monitoring of electrical activity of body
functions. The most widely used electrodes require that the
skin be prepared before applying the electrode in order to
get good electrical contact. This is usually accomplished
by first wiping the skin with alcohol to remove dirt and
oils. The skin is then further prepared by abrading the
electrode sites with a grit-impregnated solution on a cotton
swab or with some other abrasive means to remove the outer
layers of skin which generally cause poor electrical
contact. The electrodes are then applied to the prepared
sites in contact with blood-enriched skin layers, thereby
giving a relatively low electrical contact impedance.Many of the pre-gelled electrodes that are widely used
in medical monitoring of electrical body signals are
disposable, pre-gelled electrodes. Examples of such
electrodes are shown and described in U.S. Patent Nos.
3,805,769 issued to Sessions; 3,828,766 issued to Krasnow;
4,029,086 issued to Corasanti; 4,640,289 issued to
Craighead; and 4,945,911 issued to Cohen. These electrodes,
however, all require multiple, separate and time consuming
steps of skin preparation, to reduce the contact impedance
with the skin before they are applied to the body.To reduce the number of steps required to prepare the
skin, several self-preparing electrodes have been developed.
U.S. Patent No. 4,027,664 issued to Heavner describes an
electrode having a cover with an abrasive surface to give
the applicator of the electrode a ready means to abrade and
prepare the skin before application of the electrode. The
abrasive means is discarded after application. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,995,392 issued to Sherwin utilizes a removable, non-conductive
brush through the center of a reusable electrode
to perform the skin preparation. U.S. Patent No. 3,774,592
issued to Lahr utilizes an electrode with an absorbent pad
placed against the skin through which a separate stiff-bristled
brush is dabbed to micropuncture the skin to
prepare it.Each of the techniques described above also require
multiple, separate components or steps to perform the skin
preparation even though they are "self-preparing". In many
situations

<CLAIMS>
An electrode for monitoring electrical signals of a body comprising:

an electrical pad (22);
an array of non-conductive tines (24) mounted on a flexible base (12, 18), said
flexible base (12, 18) being arranged in close proximity to said electrical pad;
characterized in that
 said array of tines (24) comprises spaced apart, flexible tines
(24) for penetrating outer layers of the skin on the body without removing any skin.
The electrode of claim 1 wherein said tines (24) are embedded in, and extend from a
surface of, a layer of conductive gel (14) mounted on one surface of said flexible base

(18).
The electrode of claim 1 wherein an adhesive layer (15) is arranged around said array
of tines (24).
The electrode of claim 2 wherein an adhesive layer (15) is arranged around said layer
of gel (14).
A removable self-prepping layer for use with a monitoring electrode comprising:

a layer of conducting gel (14);
an array of non-conductive flexible tines (24) arranged in said layer of gel so that said
tines (24) extend beyond a surface of said gel (14) for penetrating outer layers of the

skin on the body without removing any skin.
The removable self-prepping layer of claim 5 further comprising at least one layer of
adhesive mounted over at least one surface of said layer of conductive gel.
The removable self-prepping layer of claim 5 wherein said tines (24) extend beyond
only one surface of said gel (14).
The removable self-prepping layer of claim 6 wherein a layer of adhesive is placed
over top and bottom surfaces of said layer of conductive gel (14).
