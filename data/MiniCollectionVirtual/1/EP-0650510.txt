<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a certain powder coating 
composition, and to a process for its preparation. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a powder coating polymer composition 
comprising a certain hybrid polymer system prepared by the insitu 
aqueous suspension polymerisation to form a granular polymer, 
especially an acrylic polymer, in the presence of another, preformed 
polymer. It is well known to employ various polymer types in thermoset 
powder coating applications. Examples of such polymers include epoxy 
resins, polyester polymers, acrylic polymers and fluoropolymers. It is 
desirable for a number of applications to use combinations of different 
polymers so that e.g. the desirable properties of each polymer provide 
their contribution to the resulting coating or a desired new effect or 
appearance is achieved. For example, an acrylic polymer used in 
combination with a polyester polymer which when crosslinked up can give 
the enhanced durability of the acrylic polymer in combination with the 
improved mechanical properties of the polyester, or alternatively can 
provide a different but desired appearance (e.g. textured rather than 
glossy or matt). A number of approaches have been described in the patent 
literature in order to achieve the degree of admixture necessary to 
give acceptable or required performance. JA88-182382 describes a 
polyester-acrylic hybrid prepared under conditions of melt 
transesterification to induce limited grafting. However the reaction 
conditions are such that control of melt viscosity due to premature 
reaction can be problematic. JA77-126433 describes the preparation of 
a carboxyl functional polyester in solvent and the subsequent insitu 
solution polymerisation to form an acrylic polymer followed by solvent 
stripping and solid polymer recovery. More typically, blending is 
achieved by coextrusion (EP 0314447, US4499239) although problems in 
achieving completely homogeneous mixing may be encountered. An additional limitation is that these approaches may not allow 
certain ratios of either type of polymer to be prepared. For example, binder compositions for use in powder coatings are 
disclosed in US-A-4499239, which describes a resin composition 
consisting substantially of 60-97 wt.% of a polyester with an acid  
 
number between 15 and 200 and 3-40 wt.% of a glycidyl acrylate polymer. 
A disadvantage of the compositions of US-A-4499239 is thought to be 
that the described mixtures have a maximum polyacrylate resin content 
of only 40 wt.%
