<ABSTRACT>
A fixing device has a pair of rollers (1,2) which are 
pressed against to each other to form a nip 

therebetween. A recording medium which carries a 
non-fixed image is clamped and conveyed by the nip to 

perform fixing. At least one of the pair of rollers (1,2) 
has a mixture layer (1b) prepared by mixing a 

perfluoroelastomer having rubber elasticity and a fluorine resin, 
or a rubber selected from the group consisting of flourine 

rubber and silicone rubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fixing device
and a fixing roller for fixing a non-fixed image of an
image visualizing agent (toner) on a recording medium,
which image is formed and carried on a recording medium
such as a transfer medium, a photosensitive paper
sheet, an electrostatic recording paper sheet, or the
like by a transfer method (indirect method) or a direct
method in an image forming means section which adopts
an appropriate image formation principle or process
such as electrophotography, electrostatic recording,
magnetic recording, or the like in an image forming
apparatus such as a copying machine, a recording
apparatus, a printer, a micro-reader printer, or the
like.As a conventional fixing device for a general
image forming apparatus such as an electrophotographic
copying machine, devices adopting various fixing
methods have been proposed and are practiced. Of these
devices, a device of a roller fixing type, in
particular a heating roller fixing device (heat roll
fixing method) in which at least one of a pair of 
rollers is a heating roller heated by a heat source is
popularly used.Of the pair of fixing rollers, a roller contacting
the image carrier surface of a recording medium will be
referred to as a fixing roller or heating roller
hereinafter, and the other roller will be referred to
as a compression roller hereinafter.As the fixing roller, the following two rollers
are known:
1 ○ a so-called "hard roller" prepared by coating a
fluorine resin such as a PFA (a copolymer resin
of tetrafluoroethylene and
perfluoroalkylvinylether), a PTFE (a
polytetrafluoroethylene resin), or the like
onto the outer surface of a core metal such as
aluminum, iron, or the like; and2 ○ a so-called "soft roller" prepared by stacking
an elastic rubber layer of, e.g., silicone
rubber, fluorine rubber, or the like, on the
outer surface of a core metal.Since the hard roller has high mold release
characteristics, it has merits such as high anti-offset
characteristics, a high heat resistance, a high
durability, and the like.Since the soft roller has elasticity, it does not
excessively press a visualized image (toner image) on a
recording medium, and does not blur the image. 
Therefore, a fixed image has high image quality. Also,
since the roller surface finely elastically deforms at
the pressing nip portion, the contact area with a toner
image on the recording medium can be widened.
Therefore, the soft roller has high fixing
characteristics.The compression roller is required to have proper
elasticity for
