<ABSTRACT>
An intravenous fiber membrane oxygenator is disclosed 
in several embodiments wherein the fibers either run at a 

transverse angle relative to the longitudinal axis of the 
oxygenator and/or are of a reduced length to optimize the 

gas transfer efficiency of the oxygenator. Various helical 
or spiral wraps of fibers are disclosed. One embodiment 

utilizes two sets of longitudinally extending fibers 
wherein the oxygen gas is moved in opposite directions from 

a central location of the oxygenator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an elongated
percutaneous oxygenator according to the precharacterizing
portion of claim 1The present invention relates generally to gas
transfer devices and more particularly to a percutaneous
intravenous oxygenator utilizing hollow gas permeable
fibers.Many types of blood oxygenators are well-known in the
art. For example, during open heart surgery, the patient
is interconnected with an external oxygenator, commonly
known as a heart-lung machine, which introduces oxygen into
the blood system. Most types of oxygenators use a gas
permeable liquid impermeable membrane. Blood flows along
one side of the membrane, and oxygen is supplied to the
other side of the membrane. Given a sufficient pressure
gradient between the oxygen supply and the blood, the
oxygen will diffuse through the membrane and into the
blood. In addition, carbon dioxide will tend to diffuse
from the blood through the membrane. In other
situations, a smaller, implantable oxygenator may be
sufficient to adequately supplement the patient's
cardiopulmonary function by marginally increasing the
oxygen content of the patient's blood. For example,
patients suffering from emphysema, pneumonia, congested
heart failure, or other chronic lung disease often have 
blood oxygen partial pressures of approximately 5320Pa(40 torr).
A relatively small increase of 10% to 20% is generally
sufficient to adequately maintain the patient. This is a
particularly desirable alternative in that it avoids the
need to intubate the patient in such cases. In addition,
temporary use of this type of oxygenator is sufficient in
many cases to tie the patient over in acute respiratory
insult. Placing such patients on a conventional respirator
is often the beginning of a progressive down hill spiral by
damaging the patient's pulmonary tree and thereby causing
greater dependence on the respirator.The effective rate of diffusion in percutaneous
oxygenators can be limited in some instances by the problem
of "streaming" or "channeling," in which the blood stream
establishes relatively stable patterns of flow around and
through the oxygenator. Portions of the oxygenator are
exposed to a relatively high velocity, turbulent flow of
blood. These conditions tend to increase cross-diffusion
of oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, other portions of
the oxygenator are exposed to a low velocity, laminar flow
of blood which reduces diffusion of gases. Those portions
of the oxygenator immediately adjacent to the regions of
the high blood flow may continue to
