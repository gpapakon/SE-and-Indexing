<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors which 
incorporate a three terminal electrical component. One type of connector includes contact assemblies 
with diodes and/or filter components. Such contact 
assemblies divert to ground any high voltage pulses, and 
can filter out unwanted frequencies. If a diode is 
destroyed when diverting a high energy pulse to ground, the 
contact assembly can be removed and another installed by 
sliding it until a clip on the contact assembly wipes 
against a ground plane mounted in the insulator assembly. 
The replaceable contact assemblies connect to circuitry 
which may include circuit boards holding multi-terminal 
components such as transistors and integrated circuits. Due 
to the easy replaceability of contact assemblies, it would 
be desirable if components more complex than diodes could 
be readily replaced. United States of America patent Number US-A-5164873 
(Krantz) describes a connector having contacts each having 
two circuit components each having two terminals. The  
 
specification does not suggest any means for employing a 
three terminal device which allows the incorporation of 
transistors with the inherent advantages of their many 
capabilities such as amplification and digital to analogue 
conversion. The present invention seeks to provide a connector 
incorporating a three terminal device. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a connector comprising a replaceable contact 
assembly, characterised in that the contact assembly is 
provided with a circuit component thereon that has three 
terminals, one of which terminals is connected to the body 
of the contact assembly, a second of which terminals is 
connected to a first clip which engages a ground plane of 
the connector, and a third of which terminals engages a 
second clip. According to another aspect of the invention, 
There is provided a method of constructing a connector 
which includes installing a plurality of insulators in a 
shell that has an axis, with each insulator having faces 
lying primarily in planes normal to the axis, characterised 
in that the steps of locating a sheet-like ground plane  
 
between a first pair of the insulators, wherein the ground 
plane and insulators have a plurality of holes forming a 
plurality of passages, constructing a plate-like circuit 
board and locating it between a second pair of insulators, 
with the circuit board having a plurality of holes each 
aligned with one of the passages including a first hole
