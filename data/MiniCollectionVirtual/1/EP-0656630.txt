<ABSTRACT>
In a boiling water nuclear reactor fuel bundle, a 
debris catching arrangement is disclosed for incorporation 

within the flow plenum up stream or below the rod supporting 
grid of the lower tie plate assembly. The device is 

preferably placed within the lower tie plate flow plenum 
between the fuel bundle inlet orifice and the rod supporting 

grid structure supporting the fuel rods; alternate placement 
can include any inlet channel upstream of the fuel rods 

including the fuel support casting. Paired plates (100A,100B) defining 
offset holes (105) and bosses (110) are utilized. The bosses (110) are 

supported at plate webbing between the respective holes (105). The 
holes are preferably square in plan with appropriately 

relieved and rounded corners (103) defining the edges of the 
webbing. The bosses (105) may be cylindrical, 
square or rectangular 
in cross-section. In confrontation of plates (100A,100B) to form the 

debris catching grid, each boss (105) from one plate confronts a 
hole from the remaining plate. A system of edge ridges in 

conjunction with the bosses at each plate edge maintains the 
plates spatially separated with the bosses of each plate 

spaced from the webbing of the opposite plate. In the 
preferred embodiment, the plates are captured in the flow 

plenum of a two part tie plate. There results a three 
dimensional and sturdy debris catching construction which has 

low flow resistance through the continuum of defined flow 
passages while maintaining excellent debris retaining 

properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
In a boiling water nuclear reactor fuel bundle, a 
debris catching arrangement is disclosed for incorporation 
within the flow volume between the inlet nozzle and the rod 
supporting grid of the lower tie plate assembly. The 
disclosed debris catching arrangements include provision for 
excluding flowing debris from entrainment into the fuel rod 
region of the fuel bundle. Boiling water nuclear reactors operate for many 
years. Commencing with their initial construction and through 
their service lives, these reactors may accumulate debris in 
their closed circulation moderator systems. This debris can 
become an operating hazard if the debris is allowed to enter 
into the fuel bundle containing core region having the heat 
generating fuel rods. In order to understand this problem, a 
summary of reactor construction as it relates to the 
accumulation of debris in the core needs first to be given. 
Thereafter, fuel bundle construction will be set forth. 
Emphasis will be given to the need to preserve substantially 
unchanged the regions of pressure drop within the fuel 
bundles. Thereafter, the effects caused by debris entering 
into the fuel rod region of the fuel bundles will be 
summarized. Boiling water nuclear reactor construction can be 
simply summarized for purposes of understanding the debris 
entrainment problem. Such nuclear reactors are provided with 
a large, central core. Liquid water coolant/moderator flow 
enters the core from the bottom and exits the core as a water 
steam mixture from the top.  The core includes many side-by-side fuel bundles. 
Water is introduced into each fuel bundle through a fuel 
bundle support casting from a high pressure plenum which is 
situated below the core. Water passes in a distributed flow 
through the individual fuel bundles, is heated to generate 
steam, and exits the upper portion of the core as a two phase 
water steam mixture from which the steam is extracted for the 
generation of energy. The core support castings and fuel bundles are a 
source of pressure loss in the circulation of water through 
the core. This pressure loss assures the substantially even 
distribution of flow across the individual fuel bundles of the 
reactor core. When it is remembered that there are as many as 
750 individual fuel bundles in a reactor core, it can be 
appreciated that assurance of the uniformity of flow 
distribution is important. To interfere with the pressure 
drop within the fuel bundles could affect the overall 
distribution of coolant/moderator within the
