<ABSTRACT>
Free piston Stirling coolers and engines are improved by a spring coupling the displacer to the piston and having a variable spring constant. Controllable variation of its spring constant permits controllable variation of displacer stroke, engine power output and cooler thermal pumping rate and thus the invention is useful for stroke limiting and load matching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of free piston
Stirling engines and coolers, broadly termed Stirling
cycle thermomechanical transducers. The invention is
more specifically directed to power control and stroke
limiting for Stirling cycle thermomechanical
transducers.Free piston Stirling engines usually drive a
mechanical load such as a pump or an electrical
alternator. Free piston Stirling coolers are usually
driven by an electric motor or the like to transfer
heat from one place to another, for example from the
inside to the outside of a freezer cabinet. Due to
fluctuations in load power demands for engines and heat
transfer demands for coolers, the Stirling machine must
have a power control to match the engine's output or
the cooler's thermal transport to the needs of the
system with which the machine is cooperating. For
example, a free piston Stirling engine driving a load 
which decreases or increases its power demand at some
time, such as an electrical alternator, must increase
or decrease engine power output accordingly.An associated problem occurs if the load on an
engine decreases or cooler thermal transport demand
decreases because the amplitude of oscillation of the
displacer and piston may increase beyond desirable
limits, causing collision of internal engine parts and
possible damage. Such overstroke results because the
energy input to the engine equals the sum of the energy
output and the energy losses of the engine. When a
'load demand decreases, the excess energy no longer
coupled to the load tends to drive the displacer to
higher amplitude, usually beyond the maximum desired
amplitude and can result in a runaway condition.
Therefore, it is additionally desirable to limit the
amplitude of oscillation of the displacer and piston in
the event of a substantial decrease in load demand. US-A-4 912 929 discloses a free piston Stirling engine, having a gas spring with
a variable spring constant, connected between the power piston and the engine
housing, that is, ground.US-A-4 945 726 shows a gas spring having a variable spring connected
between the displacer of a free piston Stirling engine and the housing ground.The problem underlying the invention is to provide for a means for controlling
the power output and limiting the amplitude of a free piston Stirling engine and
controlling the thermal transport of free piston Stirling cooler.This problem is solved by the inventive concept defined in independent claims
1, 5 and 6. Particular embodiments are defined in the dependent claims. This
