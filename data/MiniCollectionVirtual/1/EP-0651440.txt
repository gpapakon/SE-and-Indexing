<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved chip package
containing a semiconductor integrated circuit.More specifically, the present invention relates to a chip
package incorporating in a body shell of synthetic plastic
material:
an integrated electronic circuit in a semiconductor
chip mounted on a chip support frame, anda heat dissipating element in contact with the chip
support frame.As known, in the specific field of application of the
present invention there is normally a requirement for
equipping the circuit chip with a heat dissipating device.The heat dissipating device is nothing but a metal slug or
in any case a good heat conductor having a mass decidedly
greater than that of the circuit chip and is placed in
contact with the latter to facilitate dispersion of heat
during operation of the circuit.The typical structure of a chip package equipped with a
heat dissipating device provides that the circuit chip be
housed and constrained on a central portion of a frame
consisting of a thin metal lamina.The circuit chip and frame are in contact along the surface
of the semiconductor substrate while the integrated circuit
is exposed on the open surface of the circuit chip. The
central portion of the frame is also connected to the heat 
dissipating element on the side opposite the circuit chip. In addition, in the frame are formed in a piece a plurality
of connectors consisting essentially of contact pins which,
after completion of the production process, allow mounting
and connecting of the circuit chip on a printed electronic
circuit board. Around the circuit chip are provided
predetermined contact points (pads) to which lead circuit
structure terminations. Between said pads and the internal
ends of the corresponding pins are connected thin wires.Finally, the metal frame, integrated circuit chip and heat
dissipating element are enclosed in a monolithic body shell
provided by injection molding with an electrically
insulating material, e.g. epoxy resin.The final result of this series of operations is shown
diagramatically in the annexed FIG. 1 which shows an
enlarged cross section of an embodiment of a chip package
provided in conformity with the known art. In FIG. 1 it is
seen that a major surface of the heat dissipating element
appears on the surface of the resin shell.To further clarify the aspects of the invention it is
useful to examine briefly the phases of a known type of
production process leading to the production of a chip
package and known as the 'drop-in process'.The heat dissipating element
