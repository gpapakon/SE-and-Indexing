<ABSTRACT>
A high frequency switching converter has a primary mosfet switch (14) controlled by an oscillator (34), and operating in resonant reset mode. The secondary includes a magnetic amplifier (38) associated with a circuit (40, 42) which applies a clamped bias voltage to the magnetic amplifier (38) to limit its flux swing. The magnetic amplifier may have an auxiliary winding (38b) arranged to produce a pedestal voltage in the secondary circuit for further reduction of flux swing. The converter also has an overload protection arrangement (60-68) operating entirely on the primary side by reference to the rise time of the reset capacitor (Cr).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dc-to-dc converters, 
particularly converters suitable for large-scale 
production at low cost. The invention is particularly 
directed at low power applications, but may also be 
applied to higher power applications. Low cost, low power dc-to-dc converters are commonly 
used as regulated power supplies in computer circuits 
and the like, and comprise basically a switching 
circuit, a transformer and an output filter. Our 
European Patent Application EP 0,481,682A (published 
after the priority date of the present application) 
describes converters operating in resonant reset mode 
at about 1MHz and using an integrated magnetic 
structure which may be in the form of a simple balun. 
One object of the present invention is to improve on 
that disclosure by providing an excellent degree of 
voltage regulation at low cost, and by producing very 
low power dissipation. The use of magnetic amplifiers (magamps) as control 
elements in switch mode converters has previously been 
considered, but these have not been extensively used as  
 
they have required special quality ferrites and have 
been poor in terms of size and energy dissipation. US-A-4,642,743 discloses a dc-to-dc converter having an 
isolation transformer having a primary and a secondary, 
switching means for switching an input voltage across 
the transformer primary, an output circuit across the 
transformer secondary which includes a low-pass filter; 
and regulating means comprising a magnetic amplifier 
connected between the transformer secondary and the 
low-pass filter, and means for applying a clamped bias 
voltage to the magnetic amplifier to limit the flux 
excursion therein. The present invention improves on such prior art, and 
is characterised in that the magnetic amplifier has a 
main winding connected in series with the secondary of 
the isolation transformer and an auxiliary winding 
connected across the input of the low-pass filter 
whereby transformer secondary voltage is applied to the 
low-pass filter when the magnetic amplifier is 
saturated and a pedestal voltage is applied to the low-pass 
filter at other times. The provision of the pedestal voltage reduces the flux 
swing while retaining full control of the output 
voltage. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by 
way of example, with reference to the drawings, in 
which:- 
Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a prior art 
converter using a magamp; Fig. 2 is a B-H curve illustrating the operation  
 
of the circuit of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a
