<ABSTRACT>
A filter assembly (10) employs a bracket (18) 
and a base (12) which mounts a disposable filter 

element cartridge (14). The bracket (18) has a 
bracket mounting portion for mounting the bracket 

(18) to a vehicle and a base mounting portion for 
mounting the base (12). The bracket mounting portion 

may be offset from the base mounting portion 
to provide mounting flexibility. The base mounting 

portion has a plurality of outwardly projecting 
catches that engage and support a corresponding 

number of hangers on the base. A threaded stud 
mounted on the bracket (18) is received between 

the hangers . A nut (24) in threaded engagement 
with the stud is torqued into engagement with the 

base (12), securing the base (12) to the bracket (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fuel filters
employed in connection with internal combustion
engines. More particularly, the present invention
relates to fuel filters and lubricating oil filters
having a replaceable cartridge for removing foreign
particles and/or separating water from the fuel supply
or oil system of an internal combustion engine.Commonly, filters employ a disposable filter
cartridge which is replaced at pre-established
intervals of filter usage. The cartridge is secured
to a base assembly that is mounted to the engine
header or some other fixed location. Variations
between mounting locations and space constraints
between different model engines and different
manufacturers require a wide variety of filter
configurations and orientations.In US-A-4,976,852, which is assigned
to the assignee of the present invention, one
disclosed fuel filter assembly is mounted to the
vehicle by means of a bracket having cooperative
shoulders which receive a clamp ring. A bolt extends
between aligned openings of the clamp ring and an
opening in the bracket for securing the clamp ring to
the bracket. The clamp ring surrounds and engages a
recessed neck of the filter base for securing the base
in position. In US-A-5,186,829, which is
also assigned to the assignee of the present
invention, one disclosed fuel filter assembly employs
a base that includes an integral mounting bracket.
The fuel filter base is mounted directly to the
vehicle. Both designs center the filter assembly on
Enclosure the mounting bracket. Additionally, in the
integral mounting bracket design the entire filter
cartridge is suspended below the mounting bracket.
Such designs impose additional design limitations on
the filter assembly due to space and mounting
constraints. WO-A-8401112 discloses an oil refiner having a filter mounted
on a bracket. The bracket comprises a main structural mounting
yoke and a positioning yoke. The base of the mounting
yoke is mounted to the fire wall and the ears are mounted to
the ears of the positioning yoke. The ends of the ears of the
positioning yoke are mounted to the filter. The positioning
yoke can be adjusted to hold the filter at a selected orientation
to conform to the space requirements within the engine
compartment.US-A-3 348 686 discloses a filter unit having a filter base
assembly that is mounted to a bracket. The base assembly
includes a horizontally extending arm and a vertically
extending flange. A fastener extends through an opening in
the flange and an opening in the bracket to clamp
