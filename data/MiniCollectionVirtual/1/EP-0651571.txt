<ABSTRACT>
A graphics data unit (17) for a digital television receiver (10) that uses 
a spatial light modulator (16). The graphics data unit (17) has a graphics 

processor (22), which offloads graphics processing tasks, such as for closed 
captioning and on-screen display, from a main processor (14). The graphics 

data unit (17) also has a character memory (24), which stores fonts for closed 
caption and on-screen display characters. A read-only memory (22a) stores 

graphics primitives. The character fonts and the graphics primitives may be 
adapted to compensate for staggered pixel layouts of the spatial light 

modulator (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to television receivers, and more particularly to
a graphics data unit as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1. Further, the
invention relates to a method of providing graphics displays on a television display screen
by use of such a unit.Today's television receivers are increasingly likely to provide special
graphics features such as closed captioning and on-screen displays. The
information for closed captioning is a part of the standard television
broadcast signal, for example, line 21 of the NTSC signal. The information
for on-screen displays is provided by a hand-held remote control unit, with
which the user changes operating parameters such as channel and volume.
The remote control unit transmits infra-red signals, which the television
receiver detects to display channel and other control-related information on
the display screen.In existing receivers, devices for detecting closed captioning and on-screen
display information provide analog outputs. These devices are
suitable for analog displays, such as cathode ray tubes. 
A captioning decoder to be used in a television receiver having a
cathode-ray tube display is known from IEEE Transactions on Consumer
Electronics, vol. 38, No. 3. August 1992, pages 261-267, XP000311847,
Hurley N.F. "A Single Chip Line 21 Captioning Decoder". The decoder
is a single-chip CMOS device known as LITOD (Line Twenty One Decoder),
which acquires, decodes and displays Line 21 captioning data from a
525 line composite video signal. The decoder may be controlled
directly for use as a stand-alone decoder or in 12C mode which also
allows for producing on-screen display captions. 
However,
analog output is not useful for digital displays, such as spatial light
modulators, which have an array of pixel elements that are addressed with
digital display data. 
In this context reference is made to U.S. Patent No. 5,079,544, which
discloses a video display system which can receive and display a
number of different video signals having different formats utilizing a
processor to extract the image from a stream of digital signals to
produce a digitized image to be displayed by a digital spatial light
modulator. 
For SLMs, the analog closed captioning and on-screen
display signals must be converted to digital form.Another characteristic of SLMs is the use of "staggered" pixel arrays,
in which the pixel elements are not laid out in square grid patterns. These
staggered patterns are advantageous in terms of overall picture quality.
However, when the

A graphics data unit (17) for a television receiver,
comprising:


a detector (21) for detecting a closed caption component of a
television signal and for converting said signal to closed caption

data, said graphics data unit (17) characterized in that its output
data are for display on a spatial light modulator (16), said spatial

light modulator (16) having a staggered pixel layout and that it
further comprises:
a graphics processor (22) for receiving said closed caption data
and for determining what characters are to be generated;
a character generator (23) in data communication with said
graphics processor, for generating pixel data representing said

characters; and
a first memory (24) in data communication with said character
generator, for storing pixel patterns representing said characters,

wherein said memory stores said characters in a form that substantially converts
staggered vertical lines caused by said staggered pixel layout into

smooth vertical lines.

infrared detector (25) for receiving infrared signals from a remote

control unit (18) and for decoding said infrared signals into a 
program for generating graphics images, and wherein said graphics

processor (22) executes said progam, using said vertical line drawing
