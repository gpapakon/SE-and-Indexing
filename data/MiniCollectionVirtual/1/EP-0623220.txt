 THREE DIMENSIONAL INTERFEROMETRIC SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR TERRAIN MAPPING EMPLOYING ALTITUDE MEASUREMENTTechnical FieldThe technical field of this invention is terrain mapping employing synthetic aperture radar.Background Art There is a need for inexpensive, guickly formed and accurate terrain elevation maps. It would be helpful it these terrain elevation maps could be constructed from radar sensor data taken from aircraft. The data could be obtained by flying over the area to be mapped while operating the radar sensor. The radar sensor data could then be.employed together with the known or measured path of the aircraft to produce the needed terrain elevation map. Synthetic aperture radar would be useful in construction of such terrain elevation maps except for some limitations in the prior art.In synthetic aperture radar the motion of the aircraft is employed to achieve greater angular resolution than obtainable by antennas that can be mounted on the aircraft. The motion of the aircraft permits formation of a synthetic antenna that is larger in size than the real antenna. This large synthetic antenna has an angular resolution corresponding to the angular resolution of an egually large physical antenna. The aircraft flies in a predetermined path and repeatedly transmits a radar signal. It is typical for this radar signal to be directed to the 

 side of the flight path via a small antenna. This cross track view may be directly perpendicular to the flight path or at some angle less than perpendicular. The same antenna receives return echoes of the transmitted signal. The return echo signals are processed in two dimensions. The time to receive an echo return from any particular piece of terrain corresponds to its slant range from the aircraft. This range is called slant range because it typically follows a downwardly slanting path from the aircraft to the ground. The echo returns also have differing Doppler frequencies. The motion of the aircraft imparts a Doppler frequency shift in the echo returns from the stationary ground. Areas directly ahead of the aircraft have a maximum closing Doppler frequency, those directly behind have a maximum opening Doppler frequency. Areas at varying angles between these extremes have intermediate Doppler frequencies. The combination of time of return and Doppler frequency permit production of a two dimensional feature map of resolution cells. Plural echo returns can be processed together with the known path and velocity of the aircraft to produce a terrain map.There is
