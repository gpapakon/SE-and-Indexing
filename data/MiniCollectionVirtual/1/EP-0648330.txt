<ABSTRACT>
Thermal conductivity of a sample (30), e.g. a diamond film, is measured by setting up a thermal gradient (38). This may be done, for example, using a heater (34) and heat sink (36). The temperature of a plurality of points (19) along the thermal gradient is then measured by illuminating them with a laser beam (10), and taking the ratio between the intensities of Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Having determined the temperature of such points, the thermal gradient, is calculated, and from that the thermal conductivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RAMAN ANALYSIS APPARATUS AND METHODSField of the InventionThis invention relates to spectroscopy.More particularly, it relates to the use of Raman spectroscopy in order to measure the thermal conductivity of a sample.Background of the InventionIt is already known that the temperature of a sample can be measured using Raman spectroscopy. See for example U.S. Patent No. 4,081,215 (Penney), in which Raman spectroscopy is used to determine the temperature of a flame. It is also known to use Raman spectroscopy to determine the temperature at a point of a solid sample. However, it has not previously been known to use such techniques to determine the thermal conductivity of a sample.One material in which it is particularly desirable to measure thermal conductivity is diamond. It has recently become possible to grow diamond films with very high quality by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) . Such a film can be grown on a substrate, e.g. silicon, and used as a heat sink for high-powered semiconductor devices such as semiconductor lasers. For such a use, the ability to measure the thermal conductivity is obviously desirable.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a method of measuring the thermal conductivity of a sample, comprising the steps of: locally heating the sample, thereby establishing a thermal gradient therein, measuring the temperature of at least a first part of the sample, and 

 deriving therefrom the thermal conductivity of the sample, characterised in that in said temperature measuring step, the temperature is measured by causing Raman scattering of light into a spectrum having at least two Raman lines, detecting said two Raman lines, and determining said temperature from the ratio of the intensities of said lines.Brief Description of the DrawingsExamples of apparatus and methods according to the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: Fig 1 is a schematic diagram of Raman analysis apparatus,Fig 2 is a schematic cross-section through a sample, the thermal conductivity of which is to be measured, andFig 3 is a diagrammatic representation of an image on a charge coupled device.Description of Preferred EmbodimentsMeasurements of thermal conductivity may be made using apparatus which is similar to that described in EuropeanPatent Application No. 92310387.3 (publication no.EP 543578) and the corresponding U.S. application no.07/976,513 and Japanese application no. 305,645/1992.Reference should be made to those earlier applications for full
