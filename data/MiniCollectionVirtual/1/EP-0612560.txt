<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention the non-catalytic high-pressure 
process for producing the melamine occurs in one single 

body having a vertical cylindrical shape divided into three 
sectors separated by means of diaphragms, each sector 

communicating with the other two through pipelines separated 
from one another. The top sector (L) is provided with 

at least one nozzle (1) for letting in the molten urea, 
with at least one distributor for the reaction gas (3), 

with at least one pipe (7) connecting said sector with the 
bottom reaction sector (R), with at least one valve (15) 

for extracting the residual gas and for adjusting the 
operating pressure of the reactor and with at least one 

exchanger cooling the urea. The bottom sector (R), wherein 
the reaction of the melamine synthesis occurs, is equipped 

with at least one element for the distribution (10) of the 
ammonia, with at least one pipe (7) for feeding the molten 

urea coming from the top sector, with at least one system 
(8) for obtaining the thermic energy necessary for the 

reaction, with at least one opening (110) made in the 
diaphragm (SR) and separating said bottom sector from the 

central sector. The central sector (S), wherein the separation 
of the gaseous products from the liquid phase of the 

reaction occurs, is provided with at least one pipe (11) 
for feeding the reaction products, with at least one distributor 

(12) of the ammonia, with means for keeping the 
temperature of said sector under control, with at least one 

opening (210) made in the diaphragm (LS), separating said 
sector from the top sector through which the reaction gases 

are transferred to the upper sector, with at least one 
tube (30) for the outlet of the melamine produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The synthesis process to produce melamine starting from 
urea is usually carried out in presence of excess NH₃, in 
order to limit the formation of deammonisation products 
such as melam-melem-melano, and it can be globally expressed 
with the endothermic reaction: 
6 CO (NH₂)₂ + n NH₃ = C₃N₃ (NH₂)₃ + 3 CO₂ + 6 NH₃ + n NH₃ 
From the chemistry of the process it can be seen that for 
every mole of melamine obtained, three moles of CO₂ and six 
moles of NH₃ together with the nNH₃ introduced in excess, 
are generated. The endothermic character of the reaction, industrially 
carried out at temperatures in the range of 400 C°, requires 
the supply of 649 KJ per mole of melamine (starting 
from molten urea at 135 C°) usually realized by heat transfer 
from molten salts circulating in coils or bayonet tubes 
situated in the reaction zone. At level of industrial application, the production processes 
of melamine from urea are usually classified in: 
catalytic processes at low-pressure: p ≦ 1 MPa non-catalytic processes at high-pressure; p ≧ 5 MPa  
Reference is made hereinafter to the non-catalytic processes 
at high-pressure and especially to the process steps 
required to obtain raw molten melamine and scrubbed reaction 
off-gas. The degree of purity of the raw melamine depends on the 
choices of a series of process parameters such as temperature, 
pressure, residence time and excess of ammonia, as 
described for instance in the U.S.A. patent 3,484,440 and 
it is generally over 95%. Following treatments of purification 
and crystallisation permit to reach purity degrees of 
≧ 99.9% as described for instance in the U.S.A. patent 
3.454.571. Also the composition of the raw off-gas produced by the 
reaction, depends on the choice of the above mentioned  
 
process parameters. Such gases, separated from the raw melamine in the liquid 
phase, contain considerable amounts of melamine, urea and 
other byproducts as described, for instance, in the U.S.A. 
patent 3,700,672 and quantified in the tables 1 and 2 of 
the same. Before recycling them to the urea-plant or before they 
undergo the process for the recovery of the ammonia they 
contain, they need to be properly washed for the recovery 
of the melamine and the urea and for the maximum possible 
energy recovery. At present and generally, the high pressure non-catalytic 
processes, industrially used, start from pressurized molten 
urea at temperatures comprised between 135° and 160° C, and 
operate in a pressure range of 5 to 20 MPa and temperature 
range of 370°
