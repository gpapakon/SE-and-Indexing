<ABSTRACT>
The tube (1) is formed by folding longitudinally a sheet steel strip whose face forming the tube external surface is coated with a brazing material (3). The tube has first (7,8) and second (11,12) opposite main walls connected by two complementary walls (9,10). The first main wall is formed from two zones of the median region of the strip width either side a fold (4) turned towards the tube interior. The second main wall is formed from two intermediate regions and two end regions (13,14) of the strip. The fold has a transverse U section whose side by side branches (5,6) extend perpendicularly to the main walls and form a reinforcing strut. The end regions support the bottom of the U. Each end region is folded into a U relative to the adjacent intermediate region and is supported by the bottom (15,16) of its U on the fold.

A flat tube (1) for the flow of a fluid within a
heat exchanger, especially a cooling radiator for the

propulsion engine of a motor vehicle, the tube being
formed by bending in its longitudinal direction a sheet

metal strip (2), a first face of which, defining the
outer surface of the tube, is coated with a braze

material (3), the tube having opposed first main walls
(7, 8) and second main walls (11, 12), which are

substantially flat and parallel to each other and which
are joined together through two complementary walls (9,

10) so as to define a closed profile, the first main
wall being formed from a middle region (7, 4, 8) of the

width of the strip, and the second main wall from two
intermediate regions (11, 12) situated on either side

of the middle region, which are juxtaposed
substantially in a common plane, and two marginal

regions (13, 14) of the strip, which are respectively
adjacent to the said intermediate regions, being bent

back substantially at 180° with respect to the latter
towards the inside of the tube, and being secured by

brazing to the internal face of the middle region,
characterised in that the first main wall is formed

from two zones (7, 8) of the middle region which are
situated laterally on either side of a pleat facing

towards the interior of the tube, with the said
marginal regions (13, 14) engaging on the pleat.
A tube according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the said pleat is located halfway along the width of

the first main wall of the tube. 
A tube according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the said pleat has a U-shaped

transverse cross section, the branches (5, 6) of which
are in mutual contact and extend at right angles to the

said main walls, the said marginal regions engaging on
the base of the U.
A tube according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that each marginal region (13, 14) is

bent back in a U-shape with respect to the adjacent
intermediate region, and engages, through the base (15,

16) of its U, on the said pleat.
A tube according to Claim 4, characterised in that
the base (15, 16) of the U in each marginal region is

in contact with that of the other marginal region and
with the said pleat (4), these three elements together

defining a cavity (18) adapted to fill with braze metal
during melting of the coating which is present on the

marginal regions.
A tube according to Claim 4 or Claim 5,
characterised in that each marginal region is bent back

flat on the adjacent intermediate region, the marginal
region and the intermediate region being in mutual

contact through the second face of the strip.
A tube according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the complementary walls (9, 10)

have a convex curved profile.
A tube according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the complementary walls have a substantially

semicircular profile. 
A method for making a tube according to one of the
preceding Claims, comprising successive steps in the

course of which:

(a) the said strip (2) is bent longitudinally so as to
form the said pleat (4), with the remainder of the

strip extending, substantially in one plane, on either
side of the pleat;
(b) the marginal regions (13, 14) of the strip are
bent back on the side of the said plane which contains

the pleat, at a predetermined distance from the latter
in the direction of the width of the strip; and
(c) the strip is reformed in a curve at a
predetermined distance from each side of the pleat so

as to define the complementary walls (9, 10) of the
tube, with the said intermediat
e regions pivoting
substantially through 180° so as to bring the marginal

regions of the strip into contact with the pleat.
