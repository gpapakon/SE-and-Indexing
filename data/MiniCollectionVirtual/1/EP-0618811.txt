<DESCRIPTION>
Escharase is a hydrolytic enzyme material free 
of caseinolytic activity with an isoelectric point of 
about six. It has a molecular weight of about 45,000 
daltons and is comprised of three subunits believed 
to be identical, each weighing about 15,000 daltons. Escharase and mixtures containing escharase are 
useful for the debridement of devitalized tissue from 
a mammalian host. It is particularly useful for the 
removal of devitalized tissue from human burn 
victims. The product, methods of isolation and methods of 
use are well known and are described for example by 
Houck, Chang and Klein in Int. J. Tiss. Reac. V(2) 
125-134 (1983) and in United States Patents 4,197,291 
issued April 8, 1980; 4,226,854 issued October 7, 
1980 and 4,307,081 issued December 22, 1981. The Houck et al publication and the patents 
describe methods of isolating escharase itself and a 
proteolytic mixture containing escharase by the 
procedures generally illustrated in Fig. 1 hereof.  
 
The proteolytic mixture containing the escharase and, 
of course, the escharase itself are useful for the 
debridement of devitalized tissue from mammals. As will be seen from the figure, the first step 
in the isolation process is to extract commercially 
available bromelain with an acetate buffer containing 
thioglycollic acid and then to filter. Specifically, 
the commercial bromelain is extracted (10 grams per 
200 ml) in acetate buffer 0.1 M, pH 5.5 which has 
been made up to 1% in thioglycolic acid. The pH of 
this solution is approximately 4. The solution is 
expressed through XM 50 Amicon Diaflo ultrafilter 
(Amicon Corp., Boston, Mass.) and concentrated over 
PM 30 Diaflo filters. The active solution containing 
a mixture of proteolytic enzymes having molecular 
weights of from 30,000 to 50,000 dalton can be either 
dialyzed at 2° to 6°C against deionized, distilled 
water (200 volumes), clarified by centrifugation, and 
the clear supernatant freeze dried; or the active 
fraction can be precipitated with 70% acetone. Both 
procedures produce useful proteolytic mixtures. As shown in Fig. 1, escharase can be isolated 
from the proteolytic enzyme mixture obtained after 
expression through XM 50 Amicon Diaflo ultrafilter as 
described above. In one isolation procedure, the enzyme mixture 
is subjected to molecular exclusion chromatography as 
a phenylmercuric salt [prepared by combining the  
 
mixture with an aqueous 0.2 M citrate buffer 
saturated with the salt in accordance with the 
procedure of Ota et al in Biochem. 3:180
