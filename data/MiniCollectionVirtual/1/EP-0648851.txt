<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tool steel article made of a
hot worked powder metallurgy tool steel having higher than
conventional sulfur content and a method for producing the
same.Tool steels are used conventionally in the manufacture
of tooling articles employed in both cutting and noncutting
tooling applications. This includes the manufacture of
broaches and hobs, as well as of rolls, punches and mold
components. In these tooling applications, it is necessary
that the tool steel have sufficient strength, toughness, and
wear resistance to withstand the service conditions
encountered in these typical applications. In addition, they
must have adequate machinability and grindability to
facilitate production of the desired tooling components.It is known that the presence of sulfur in tool steels
improves their machinability and grindability by forming
sulfides that act as a lubricant between the cutting tools
used to form the tool component and the chips removed from
the steel during this operation. The sulfides also promote
chip breaking during the cutting operation incident to tool
manufacture to thereby further facilitate this operation.The use of sulfur in amounts over about 0.10% is known
to reduce the hot workability of conventional ingot-cast tool
steels and adversely affect their mechanical properties, 
particularly their toughness. In conventional high sulfur
containing tool steels, the sulfides are typically larger and
elongated in the direction of hot working. Likewise, with
conventional wrought tool steels, the primary carbides in the
steel are strung out during hot working to form carbide
stringers in the direction of working. The carbide stringers
in these steels adversely affect mechanical properties, and
their negative effects are so pronounced that they generally
overshadow any adverse effects of the sulfides in this
regard.On the other hand, during the manufacture of high sulfur
containing tool steel articles by a powder metallurgy
practice wherein prealloyed particles of the steel are
consolidated to achieve a fully dense article, the carbides
are relatively small and well distributed compared to those
in conventional tool steels. Because of the favorable size
and distribution of the carbides achieved in these tool
steels, the adverse effects of the carbide stringers
encountered in conventional wrought steel are avoided. The
properties of the powder metallurgy produced tool steels are
therefore more sensitive to changes in sulfur content and to
the size and distribution of the sulfides
