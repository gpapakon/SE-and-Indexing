<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are composite films comprising: 

A) a single- or multilayer bioriented film, wherein the 
single layer or at least one layer of said bioriented 

film is propylene crystalline homopolymer; and 
B) a single- or multilayer cast film, wherein the single 
layer or at least one layer of said cast film is a layer 

of a composition comprising: I) propylene crystalline 
homopolymer, or a crystalline copolymer of propylene with 

ethylene and/or a C₄-C₈ α-olefin; II) a copolymer 
fraction containing propylene and ethylene, insoluble in 

xylene at ambient temperature; III) a copolymer of 
ethylene with propylene and/or a C₄-C₈ α-olefin and 

soluble in xylene at ambient temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composite films
comprising two films coupled together, each of them having one
or more layers. More particularly, the present invention
relates to polyolefin composite films having improved tear and
perforation resistance at low temperatures, improved resistance
of the seal to the pressure exercised on it and processability
when using packaging machines that fill either vertically or
horizontally.The composite films described below are particularly
suitable for use in the packaging field. In particular,
because of their mechanical and physical properties, the films
of the present invention are suitable for food packaging,
especially for the production of bags to be used for solid
and/or liquid products, and/or to preserve products that must
be kept at low temperatures.Already commonly used are polyolefin films coupled with
films made of materials of another nature, to produce composite
films that are used, among other things, in the food packaging
field. For example, used at present are composite films
comprising a polyethylene (such as LDPE, for example) or
polypropylene film and a polyamide or polyethylene
terephthalate film. Due to the particular selection of the
materials comprising said films and because of their
properties, they can be adequately used for the production of
bags using vertical or horizontal fill machines. Moreover, already known in the art are also composite
films comprising solely polypropylene films, as known, for
example, from European patent application EP-A-533 493. Said
EP-A-533 493 patent application describes composite films
produced by coupling together two or more films, with at least
one of them comprising an amorphous polyolefin, optionally
containing crystalline polypropylene, and one or more
crystalline polypropylene films. Said composite films, as well
as the films that comprise them, are nonoriented films, and in
the description it is never suggested that one of the films
comprising the composite films can be subjected to an
orientation process. Therefore, the composite films described
in said patent application, not having the properties and
characteristics of the films of the present invention, are not
suitable for the specific applications that the films of the
present invention are destined for.Composite films are also described in international patent
application WO 91/11324, whose object, among other things,
includes polypropylene composite films with high mechanical
resistance. To this end said patent application describes
