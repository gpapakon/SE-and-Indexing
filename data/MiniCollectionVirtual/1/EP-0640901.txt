<ABSTRACT>
In known numerically controlled machine tools, auxiliary functions such as tool changes are carried out only at the beginning or the end of a set of subprograms. This means, in the case of a tool change, that the machine must be driven into the exact tool-change position before the tool change is initiated. In fact, the tool change could be started before the exact change position is reached, and time could thus be saved. According to the invention, therefore, conditional instructions are provided in subprograms (PSP), which instructions permit further actions (ITP, PRG, ALE) to be initiated or carried out during the processing of the set of subprograms. The invention is applied in the case of numerically controlled machine tools.

<CLAIMS>
Machine tool or robot control, which is 
controlled by a part program consisting of records 

(N40, N50, N60, N70), whereby during the processing of 
the part program in dependence upon one or more given 

conditions one or more actions are started and whereby 
the part program consists at least of a motion record 

(N60) and at least one condition record (N50),
 
characterized in that 


a converter (UMS) is present, to which the motion 
record (N60) and the at least one condition record 

(N50) are supplied, 
the converter (UMS) enters the motion statement of 
the motion record (N60) into an internal buffer 

(PFR) and converts the at least one condition 
record (N50) into two further entries in the 

internal buffer (PFR) which contain the condition 
and the action to be performed after its 

fulfilment, 
the internal buffer (PFR) supplies: 

the motion statement to an interpolator (ITP) 
which forms from this desired values for the 

control of the movement of the machine, 
the condition to a monitoring unit (PRG) and 
the action to be performed after the 
fulfilment of the condition to a tripping 

unit (ALE) and 
the tripping unit (ALE) obtains a status signal 
from the monitoring unit (PRG) upon fulfilment of 

the condition and thereupon initiates the action 
to be performed. 
Machine tool or robot control according to 
claim 1, characterized in that 


the part program comprises the motion record 
(N130) and several condition records (N100, N110, 

N120),  
 
the converter (UMS) converts each condition record 
(N100, N110, N120) in each case into two entries 

in the internal buffer (PFR), 
the performance of each action is acknowledged to 
the tripping unit (ALE) and 
when all the actions to be performed are 
acknowledged to the tripping unit (ALE) the 

processing of the next program record (N140) is 
enabled. 
Machine tool or robot control according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the condition 

entered in the internal buffer (PFR) and the action to 
be performed after its fulfilment are each provided 

with the same identifier (EVENT, EVENT_1, ...) and in 
that the respective status signal is the respective 

identifier (EVENT, EVENT_1, ...). 
Machine tool or robot control according to one 
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the condition 

records (N50; N100, N110, N120) are put before the 
associated motion records (N60; N130). 
Machine tool or robot control according to one 
of the preceding claims 


having a tool changer which by means of a tool 
change replaces a tool to be changed for another 

tool, whereby to that end the tool to be changed 
is moved into a change position, 
 
characterized in that 


the motion statement is the movement of the tool 
to be changed to the change position, 
the action is the tool change and 
the condition is reaching a given desired position 
lying in front of the change position, with the 

tool to be changed passing through this desired 
position during the movement to the change 

position, and 
in this way the tool change begins at the same  
 

time as the exact motion of the tool into the 
change position. 
Machine tool or robot control according to one 
of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 


the motion statement includes as target position a 
change position (X=0, Y=0) and a speed at which 

the tool change position is started, and in that 
one of the condition records (N50; N100, N110, 
N120) includes as action a tool change and as 

condition the reaching of an axle position 
(desired position) different from the change 

position.
