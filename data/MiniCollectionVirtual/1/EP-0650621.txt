<ABSTRACT>
An access control system for a public transport system comprises, at each entrance/exit location (1) of the transport system, at least one entrance gate (12) provided with a ticket reader (8), at least one exit gate (20) provided with a ticket reader (16), a ticket issuing machine (22) and a local data processor (10) with which the other items communicate. The local processors (10) communicate via a central processor (14). The tickets bear unique identification codes which are stored, upon issue, in the local processors (10) at the location (1) at which they are valid for entry. Upon entry using a ticket the relevant code is cancelled at all locations and then it is stored again in the local processors (10) at those locations (1) at which it is valid for exit. Upon exit using a ticket the relevant code is cancelled at all locations. If entry or exit is attempted at a location (1) at which the relevant code is not stored, the relevant gate (12 or 20) is barred.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an access control system for a public transport system 
having a plurality of entrance/exit locations the control system comprising, at each 
entrance/exit location, at least one entrance gate which is provided with a ticket 
reading facility, at least one exit gate which is provided with a ticket reading facility, 
a local data processor, a data communication channel between the or each entrance 
gate and the local data processor, and a data communication channel between the or 
each exit gate and the local data processor, the control system further comprising both 
a data communication network interconnecting the local data processors and at least 
one ticket issuing facility for issuing single-fare tickets which carry respective 
identification codes. A known such system is disclosed in GB-A-1372180. In this known system, 
in which a ticket issuing facility is provided at each entrance/exit location, single-fare 
tickets are encoded on purchase with details of exit stations within the system together 
with further details of validity. The encoding is on a single magnetic track running 
down the centre of the ticket. Automatic checking takes place at entry to and exit 
from the system in order to establish validity. Upon presentation of a ticket to the 
ticket reading facility of an entrance gate the local data processor at the corresponding 
location inter alia causes some information to be encoded on the ticket aimed at 
minimising fraudulent use. Each local data processor inter alia stores the serial 
numbers of the last ten tickets processed at each entrance and exit gate. It then 
compares the next serial number with these serial numbers and, if it coincides with 
any of them, the ticket is declared invalid. thereby preventing so-called "pass-back" 
fraud. If a ticket is found to be invalid for any reason it is rejected. It is an object of the present invention to enable "read-only" tickets to be 
employed in a system as defined in the first paragraph. According to the invention a public transport system as defined in the first 
paragraph is characterized in that the or each ticket issuing facility is connected to the 
data communication network, 
in that each ticket issuing facility is arranged to communicate, upon issue 
thereby of a single-fare ticket, the identification code of that ticket and the location(s) 
for which the ticket is valid for opening an entrance gate, to the local data processor  
 
which is situated at the or each such location, and each such local

<CLAIMS>
An access control system for a public transport system having a plurality of 
entrance/exit locations (1) the control system comprising, at each entrance/exit location (1), 

at least one entrance gate (12) which is provided with a ticket reading facility (8), at least one 
exit gate (20) which is provided with a ticket reading facility (16) a local data processor (10), a data 

communication channel (5) between the or each entrance gate and the local data 
processor, and a data communication channel (7) between the or each exit gate and the 

local data processor, the control system further comprising both a data communication 
network interconnecting the local data processors and at least one ticket issuing 

facility (22) for issuing single-fare tickets which carry respective identification codes,
 
   characterized in that the or each ticket issuing facility is connected to the data 

communication network (3), 

in that each ticket issuing facility is arranged to communicate, upon issue 
thereby of a single-fare ticket, the identification code of that ticket and the location(s) 

for which the ticket is valid for opening an entrance gate, to the local data processor 
which is situated at the or each such location, and each such local data processor is 

arranged to respond by recording that a ticket bearing this identification code is valid 
for opening an entrance gate at the corresponding location, 
in that each entrance gate is arranged to communicate, upon presentation of a 
single-fare ticket to the ticket reading facility of that gate, the identification code of 

that ticket to the local data processor at the corresponding location and the local data 
processor is arranged to respond, if and only if it has a record that a ticket bearing this 

identification code is valid for opening an entrance gate at the corresponding location, 
by (i) permitting opening of the corresponding entrance gate and (ii) cancelling its 

record that a ticket bearing this identification code is valid for opening an entrance 
gate at the corresponding location, 
in that each local data processor is arranged to communicate, upon opening of 
an entrance gate at the corresponding location in response to the presentation of a 

single-fare ticket to the ticket reading facility of that gate, the identification code of 
that ticket to the local data processor at the or each location at which that ticket is 

valid to permit exit from the system and the or each local data processor to which this 
code is thus communicated is arranged to respond by recording that a ticket bearing  

 
this identification code is valid for opening an exit gate at the corresponding location, 
in that each exit gate is arranged to communicate, upon presentation of a 
single-fare ticket to the ticket reading facility of that gate, the identification code of 

that ticket to the local data processor at the corresponding location and the local data 
processor is arranged to respond, if and only if it has a record that a ticket bearing this 

identification code is valid for opening an exit gate at the corresponding location, by 
(i) permitting opening of the corresponding exit gate and (ii) cancelling its record that 

a ticket bearing this identification code is valid for opening an exit gate at the 
corresponding location, 
and in that each local data processor is arranged to communicate, upon opening 
of an exit gate at the corresponding location in response to the presentation of a 

single-fare ticket to the ticket reading facility of that gate, the identification code of 
that ticket to the local data processor at any other location at which that ticket was 

valid to permit exit from the system and the or each local data processor to which this 
code is thus communicated is arranged to respond by cancelling its record that a ticket 

bearing this identification code is valid for opening an exit gate at the corresponding 
location. 
A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the data communication network 
interconnecting the local data processors is provided by a central data processor (14).
