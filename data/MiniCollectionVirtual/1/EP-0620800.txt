<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention both an apparatus and a method is provided for altering the length of travel of an elevator counterweight (14) relative to the travel of an elevator car (12) in a hoistway, where the car (12) and counterweight (14) are attached to one another by a plurality of ropes (62). A tubular linear motor (31) having a movable member (34) and a fixed member (36), propels the car (12) through the hoistway. A first sheave (30) is attached to a movable member (34) and a second sheave (42) is fixed within the hoistway. A plurality of ropes (62) wrap around the first (30) and second (42) sheaves and attach to the car (12), thereby connecting the movable member (34) of the linear motor (31) and the elevator car (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Description A Roping Method for an ElevatorTechnical Field r-t This invention relates to elevators in general, 5 and more specifically to the roping of an elevator in a * hoistway.Background ArtElevators typically consist of an elevator car and a counterweight for travel within a hoistway. A pair of10 sheaves fixed within the hoistway above the car and counterweight guide a plurality of ropes which attach the car and the counterweight. One end of each rope attaches to the car and the other end attaches to the counterweight. The ropes extend from the car up the15 hoistway to the sheaves, around the sheaves, and back down the hoistway to the counterweight. Movement of either the car or the counterweight a distance causes the other to travel a like distance in the opposite direction.20 Tubular linear motors having a cylindrical shaped secondary and a tubular shaped primary may be used to power an elevator. The secondary is received within the center of the primary and an air gap is maintained between the secondary and the inner diameter of the25 primary. Introducing electrical current into the primary creates magnetic flux which travels between the primary and secondary. The magnetic flux, in turn, creates attractive and repulsive forces between the primary and the secondary, thereby causing relative30 motion between the two. Î› A disadvantage of the tubular linear motor, however, is that the travel of the motor is limited (and*
 therefore the travel of the car in a conventionally roped elevator) since the secondary may only be attached on the ends. Attaching the secondary on the ends causes two problems in elevator applications. First, the sinusoidal nature of the attractive forces created by the magnetic flux can cause the secondary to deflect and vibrate. A secondary attached only at the ends is more susceptible to deflection and vibration. Second, there are practical material limits to the length of a secondary which is supported only at each end. The longer the secondary is, the less rigid it will be. A vibrating or flexible secondary will compromise the air gap between the primary and the secondary, and thereby negatively effect the performance of the motor.Disclosure of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide an elevator driven by a tubular linear motor which minimizes the necessary travel of the linear motor, thereby allowing a shorter, more rigid secondary to be used which increase the efficiency of the motor.It is a further object of the present invention to provide an
