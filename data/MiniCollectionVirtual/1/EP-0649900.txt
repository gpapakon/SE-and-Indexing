<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
production of proteins. More particularly, the present
invention relates a method for enhancing the productivity
of proteins by adding a trichostatin to a culture medium.Various useful substances such as biologically
active proteins are produced in an industrial scale,
using as hosts microorganisms, animal cells, etc. by
recombinant DNA technology.Although the use of microorganisms such as E.
coli for the production of useful substances such as
proteins is advantageous in the productivity, they are
not applicable in the case where a desired protein to be
produced has a high molecular weight and a complicated
tertiary structure, it is difficult to refold the protein
formed by refolding by host from E.coli extracts, or
where a desired protein to be produced must be modified
by for example glycosylation for exhibition of its
biological activity. To produce such a protein, animal
cells are usually used. Known animal cells include
CHO-Kl (Chinese hamster ovary cell; ATCC CCL61), CHO-Kl-derived
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-lacking strain,
C127I (mouse breast cancer cell; ATCC CRL 1619), BHK
(new-born hamster kidney cell; ATCC CCL 10), Vero
(African green monkey kidney cell; ATCC CCL-81) etc.
However, in comparison of animal cells with microbial
cells, the animal cells are disadvantageous in that their
growth rate is low, culture media are expensive, and
their productivity for a desired product is low. It is
difficult to change low growth rate, because it relates
to properties of the cells per se. In addition, basic
improvement of cost of culture media is difficult because 
the media must contain all of essential components
necessary for the growth of the cells. Accordingly, in
an industrial production of a desired product using
animal cells, an improvement of productivity, i.e., an
increase of the desired product produced by each cell is
important.So far, for enhancement of productivity of a
desired protein by animal cells, straight chain alkanoic
acids such as butyric acid (Japanese Examined Patent
Publication (Kokoku) No. 56-46797, and Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 1-257492);
glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone, dexamethasone
etc. (Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku)
No. 5-32031, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 57-74093); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Japanese
Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 60-18398); and
the like have been used. It is reported that butyric
acid exhibits an action to inhibit
