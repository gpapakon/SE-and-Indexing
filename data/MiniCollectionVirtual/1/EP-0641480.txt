<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for preparing length symbols on products of high length/diameter ratio, especially on cable mantles includes at least one signing unit arranged in transporting means having drive (4, 5) for conveying a product of high length/diameter ratio, especially cable, wherein the signing unit has a contacting surface bearing a negative pattern of the symbols to be prepared on the surface of the product, the contacting surface being connected with respective outputs of at least one container for forwarding a paint substance to the negative pattern. According to the invention the apparatus is equipped with at least two detecting elements (1, 2) associated with a section of predetermined length of the product and on the contacting surface of the signing unit the negative pattern includes a part for preparing a length symbol (6) which is recognisable by the detecting elements (1, 2) and further the detecting elements (1, 2) are connected with positioning means (3) applied for controlling a system of regulating the drive (4, 5) of the signing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR PREPARING LENGTH SYMBOLS ON PRODUCTS OF HIGH LENGTH/DIAMETERRATIO, ESPECIALLY ON CABLE MANTLESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention refers to an apparatus for preparing length symbols on products of high length/diameter ratio, especially on cable mantles made of an appropriate plastic material. The proposed apparatus is equipped with drum type means for conveying a product of high length/diameter ratio, especially a cable, wherein the conveying means are prepared with a signing unit having a contacting surface bearing a negative pattern of the symbols to be brought onto the surface of the product, especially on the cable mantle, and the contacting surface is connected with respective output of at least one container for forwarding a paint substance to the negative pattern prepared on the contacting surface. The apparatus of the invention is capable of preparing length symbols at predetermined distances with high precision of their location on different products including cables, tubes, especially plastic tubes and bands.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe cable mantles and many other products of high length/diameter ratio manufactured in a continuous manner are usually made of plastics and especially of polyethylene or polyvinyl-chloride. These products usually and the cable mantles always are prepared with symbols referring to the kind of the application of the product and with length symbols prepared at predetermined distances. In the case of cables the length symbols are consisted of a set of numbers determining the length in an appropriate unit and of course further symbols can be used also. Different apparatuses for preparing length and other symbols on the cable mantles are known from the German patent specifications No DE-C3 23,57,494 and DE-C3 25,09.027. The specifications of the patents mentioned show a solution according to which the product (cable) is conducted between signing drums and the symbols are prepared with a paint substance which is bond rather by chemical forces then by adhesion with the material of the mantle. This is carried out in the way that a pulverised paint substance is brought to a negative pattern prepared on the surface of the drum contacting ther product during conveying the product in the manufacturing line. The paint substance is forwarded onto the surface of the cable by applying an appropriate pressure between the product and the contacting surface and it is fixed by applying elevated temperature. The pattern printed in this way in the surface of the mantle
