<ABSTRACT>
Universal support for manufacturing models of removable 
tooths, comprising a support plate (1) having dimensions superior than 

those of an ordinary dental tray support and provided on its lower face 
with a recess (2) having a substantially rectangular or square shape, said 

recess (2) having dimensions and thickness not lesser than the maximum 
dimension of an ordinary base for models of dental arches, and provided 

with pins for blocking the base introduced in passing holes (3, 4, 5) 
realized through the thickness of the plate (1). The support further 

comprises a shoulder (8) for the dental tray support, preferably divided in 
two sections (15 and 16) removably connected to said plate (1) along one 

side of the same, preferably comprosong a curved band (21) to contain 
the dental tray support on said plate (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an universal support for
manufacturing models of dental arches. More specifically, the invention
concerns an auxiliary device for the correct reciprocal positioning of the
negative impression and of the elements that will constitute the model
during the various steps of manufacturing of the same model.As it is well known, in order to realize dental prostheses,
bridges and caps, as well as orthodontic apparatuses, negative
impressions of the dental arch are taken, said negative impressions being
then developed in order to obtain the relevant model, pouring a suitable
casting stone material. Some pins are embedded within the stone material
crown model, before it solidifies, said pins being provided between the
various teeth or group of teeth upon will be necessary to intervene, and
axially aligned therewith.According to what is described in U.S.A. patent no. 3,890,710,
wherein the technique of the so called "Dowel Pins" is described, the pins
are positioned corresponding to the relevant teeth, using an alignment
device made up of a lower support plate upon which the dental tray
support with the negative impression is provided, and of an upper plate
provided directly above the other one and coupled to the same by two
telescopic vertical rods. To the lower face of the second plate a base
covered with a layer of a deformable material, e.g. a polymeric foam, is
fixed, in which the pins must be singularly coupled. The exact position of
each pin is determined centring it with respect to the negative impression
of the corresponding tooth and lowering the upper plate, so that the rear
part of the pin remains fixed within the layer of deformable material. As
soon as all the pins have been positioned, the stone material is poured in
the negative impression and the upper plate is lowered with the pins in
the mixture, so that they are embedded up to a predetermined height.When the stone material crown hardened, after having
separated the layer of deformable material from the pins, a second
quantitative of stone material is poured in the negative impression,
corresponding in the model to the gums section and to a terminal base.According to the European Patent No. 0 030 312, a method
similar to the previous one does not allow to realize sufficiently exact
models, either for the difficulties met while centring the pins with respect 
to the negative impression and disposing them perfectly, normal to the
model plane, or because the stone material mixture, is subject to
dimensional

Support for manufacturing models of dental arches,
comprising a support plate (1) and a shoulder (8) for a dental tray support

to be removably connected to said plate (1) along one side, said shoulder
(8) being normal with respect to said plate (1), characterised in that said

plate (1) is provided on its upwardly directed face with a recess (2) having a
substantially rectangular or square shape and being provided with

blocking pins introduced in passing holes (3, 4, 5) through the lateral
sides of the plate (1), and one side (7) of said recess (2) being exactly

aligned with said shoulder (8); said recess (2) having dimensions suitable
to accommodate the commonly used base plates for

models.
Support according to claim 1, wherein some peripheral flat
projections (11-14) are provided on the bottom of said recess (2).
Support according to claim 2, wherein said peripheral
projections (11-14) comprise a step (1 1) along a second side (6) of said

recess (2) normal with respect to said first side (7), two substantially
square projections (12 and 13) provided at the ends of a third side of said

recess (2) opposite to said side (6) and a further projection (14) placed in
an intermediate position along the fourth side of said recess (2), opposite

with respect to said first side (7), said projections (12-14) and said step
(11) having all the same thickness.
Support according to claim 3, wherein said passing holes (3,
4 and 5) for said blocking pins are three, two of them (3 and 4) being

parallel with respect to said fourth and first side (7), both having an
opening on said third side, and one (5) diagonal along a line converging

toward the angle of said recess (2) realized by said first (7) and second
(6) side, and with an opening on said fourth side.
Support according to each one of the preceding claims 1-4,
wherein said shoulder (8) is provided with a vertical projection (17) for

aligning said base during the production of the model, exactly aligned with
said second side (6) of said recess (2).
Support according to each one of the preceding claims 1-5, 
wherein said shoulder (8) is divided in two sections (15 and 16) by a

horizontal cut, said sections being removably connected to each other.
Support according to each one of the preceding claims 1-6,
wherein said support plate (1) is provided on its upper surface with a

reference line (9) exactly corresponding to said second side (6) of said
recess.
Support according to claim 7, wherein said support plate (1)
is provided on its upper surface with further reference lines corresponding to

the other sides of said recess.
