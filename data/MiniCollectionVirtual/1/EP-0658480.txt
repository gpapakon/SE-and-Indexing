<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an opening arrangement (1) with a hole (3) provided in the 
packaging material and covered by an outer strip (4). The strip (4) has an unsealed 

portion (5) folded over the sealed portion of the strip. Once the package has been filled 
and finally formed, the package is provided with a thermoplastic structure (6) 

surrounding the strip (4). The thermoplastic structure (6) consists of two parts, a 
pouring element (7) and a closure element (9). The closure element (9) is folded over 

and engages configurationally with the pouring element (7). A heel (10) is placed on the 
closure element (9) such that it is located flush with the lower surface of the pouring 

element (7). When the lower surface of the pouring element (7) is provided with the 
same substance, whereupon the thermoplastic structure (6) is sealed against the 

package (2). In this instance the surface area 11 of the heel (10) will be sealed to the 
unsealed portion (5) of the strip (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opening arrangement for liquid packages 
manufactured from a material web or a material sheet, and comprising a hole or hole 
indication which is punched in the material and which, prior to filling and forming of the 
package, is closed by means of a strip which has an unsealed portion folded over the 
sealed portion of the strip, and a thermoplastic structure surrounding the strip 
in such a manner that it is wholly discrete from said strip and 
consisting of a pouring element and a closure element, and being secured to the finally 
formed package. The type of package which is manufactured from a laminate consisting of a 
paperboard or paper core with thermoplastic and aluminum foil can be manufactured 
from a continuous material web or from individual blanks. This type of package is often 
provided with an opening arrangement consisting of a so-called pull-tab which is torn 
off when the package is opened. It is also known 
from EP-A- 0 558 946, to provide this type of package with an 
outer thermoplastic structure which surrounds the strip 
in such a manner that it is wholly discrete from said strip. This 
thermoplastic structure may be designed with a pouring element and a closure element 
and, by means of a hinge function, the two elements can be folded over one another 
and configurationally rigidly engage in one another. The strip lying beneath this 
thermoplastic structure often has a part which is unsealed and is folded over the sealed 
portion of the strip. This provision is to make possible, in a simple manner, the grasping 
of the strip and its tearing off when the package is opened. However, difficulties may be experienced in simply grasping the unsealed 
portion of the strip when the unsealed folded-over portion is pressed against the sealed 
portion as a result of the manufacturing process and treatment in the filling machine, so 
that the unsealed portion lies tightly pressed against the sealed portion. One object of the present invention is to realise an opening arrangement which 
possesses the properties of the above-disclosed prior art opening arrangements, but 
which obviates the problems inherent in lifting the unsealed, free end of the strip, so 
that it is easy to grasp the free end of the strip and manually tear it off or that the strip is 
teared off in the same opening procedure.  
 This and other objects have been attained according to the present invention in 
that the opening arrangement of the type described by way of introduction has

<CLAIMS>
An opening arrangement (1) for liquid packages (2) manufactured from a 
material web or a material sheet, and comprising a hole (3) or hole indication which is 

punched in the material and which, prior to filling and forming of the package (2), is 
closed by means of a strip (4) which has an unsealed portion (5) folded over the sealed 

portion of said strip (4), and a thermoplastic structure (6) surrounding the strip (4) 
in such a manner that it is wholly discrete from said strip (4) and 

consisting of a pouring element (7) and a closure element (9), and being secured to the 
finally formed package (2), 
characterized in that
 the unsealed portion (5) of the strip 
(4) is at a part area (4) fixedly sealed against the closure element (9) of the

characterized in that
 the 
closure element (9) is provided with a heel (10), designed such that it is located flush 

with the lower surface of the pouring element (7), when the closure element (9) is 
folded over the pouring element (7). 
The opening arrangement (1) as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said 
heel (10) has a surface area of at least 1 mm
2
. 
The opening arrangement (1) as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
outer thermoplastic structure (6) is fixedly sealed 

to the package material by means of a sealing substance. 
The opening arrangement (1) as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
sealing substance consists of hot melt adhesive.
