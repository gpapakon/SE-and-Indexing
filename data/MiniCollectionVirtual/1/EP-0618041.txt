<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for pretreating an electronic 
component manufacturing frame (F) which is prepared by 

punching. The method comprises blasting abrasive particles (S) 
entrained in a high speed air stream toward the frame, wherein 

the abrasive particles has an average diameter of no more than 
200 micrometers, preferably no more than 100 micrometer, 

particularly no more than 50 micrometers. The abrasive 
particles may be advantageously made of glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
pretreating an electronic component manufacturing frame such as
a leadframe. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a method for peening surfaces of a leadframe
before using it for manufacturing electronic components.As is well known, electronic components or semiconductor
devices such as ICs or LSIs are typically made by using a
specially designed manufacturing frame called a "leadframe". Due
to a recent tendency of highly integrating electronic
components, the leadframe also has a highly
sophisticated pattern.Figs. 15 through 18 show an example of a highly
sophisticated leadframe. Specifically, the leadframe generally
represented by reference sign F includes a plurality of chip
bonding islands (d) (only one shown) each surrounded by a
rectangularly arranged group of dam bars (a). Each of the
islands (d) is connected to the leadframe via support bars (h).The leadframe F further includes a group of outer leads
(b) extending outwardly from each dam bar (a), and a group of
inner leads (c) extending inwardly from the dam bar toward a
corresponding island (d). Initially, the group of inner leads
(c) have wire bonding ends connected to each other by a tie bar
(e), as shown in Fig. 16.The leadframe F may have a small thickness of 0.2mm for
example. Further, due to the high degree of integration, the 
outer leads (b) in each group may be densely arranged at a
small pitch,of 0.5mm for example. Obviously, the pitch between
the inner leads (c) in the same group is substantially equal to
that between the outer leads (b) but reduces progressively
toward the chip bonding island (d) (see Figs. 15, 16 and 18).In manufacture of electronic components, a semiconductor
chip (not shown) is first bonded to each chip bonding island
(d) of the leadframe F. Then, an electrically insulating
adhesive tape (f) is applied to the inner leads (c) near each
tie bar (e), and the tie bar (e) is cut off from the inner leads (C)
(see Fig. 18). Then, the chip is electrically connected to the
inner leads (c) via metal wires (not shown). Then, a resin
package is formed for a portion of the leadframe F (including
the non-illustrated chip) surround by each rectangular group of
dam bars (a), and portions of the dam bars (a) between the
respective outer leads (b) are removed to make the
respective outer leads (b) (and the inner leads as well)
electrically independent from each other. Finally, the outer
leads (b) and the support bars (h) are cut off from the leadframe F,
and the outer leads (b)
