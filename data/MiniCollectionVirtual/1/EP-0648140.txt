<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pulsed magnetic
induction and is particularly directed to improved
apparatus for inducing electrical activity
within and around the cells of the human body and
other biological matter for therapeutic purposes and
the like.It has long been known that electrical current
and electrical and magnetic fields have significant
effects on the human body and various therapeutic
techniques have been proposed heretofore for employing
such electrical and magnetic effects to achieve
beneficial results. In connection with this, it has
been determined that human body cells have an electric
potential across the surrounding membrane of the cell
which energizes the sodium-potassium activity of the
cell which, in turn, is responsible for the ion
concentration of the cell and the maintenance of the
transmembrane potential. When young and healthy,
human body cells have a transmembrane potential of the
order of 70 millivolts, whereas the transmembrane
potential of an aged or unhealthy cell is considerably
lower, approximately 50 millivolts. A cancer tumor
cell can have a transmembrane potential as low as 15
millivolts. It has been found that cells with a low
transmembrane potential are the source of pain
generation signals which cause a sense of strong pain.
At the same time, the membrane serves to resist
extremely strong external electrical fields of the
order at least of 70 mv/membrane thickness = 70 
mv/several Angstrom, which is of the order at least of
106 v/m. Only a stronger external electrical source
might serve to alter directly the transmembrane
potential and, hence, effect the health of the cell.
The value of 106 v/m for an applied electrical field is
prohibitive, as it surpasses the dielectric strength
of the atmospheric air, which is 10 Kv/cm, or just 106
v/m, i.e. the atmospheric air will break down by such
a strong electric field before the membrane of a cell
breaks down. This seems to be nature's way for
safeguarding the cell against outside electrical
disturbances.Working in this direction, Nordenstrom was
led to develop a quite successful method for the cure
of cancer by introducing electrodes to supply electric
current directly inside the cancerous area. An
electric contact in a small area creates a strong
field, of the order of several volts per meter v/m,
which is inversely proportional to the separation of
the electrodes. Theoretically, this field can reach
any value by reducing the separation distance of the
contact electrodes and might be independent of the
total potential in
