<ABSTRACT>
A Class L fuse comprises a pair of conductive elements (28) at the opposite ends of the fuse. A fusible element is secured to and makes electrical contact with each of the conductive elements (12, 14). A generally cylindrical housing (40) encloses the fusible element. Finally, an insulating, free-flowing arc barrier-forming body (46) or sealant is disposed within the housing. In particular, the arc barrier-forming body or sealant is disposed between a portion of the fusible element (28) and each of the conductive elements (12, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fuses for 
interrupting the flow of current through an electrical 
circuit upon predetermined overload conditions. More 
particularly, this invention has its most important 
application as an improvement in so-called Class L fuses 
for high-power applications.  
 Class L fuses are used in high-power 
applications. As an example, Class L fuses are typically 
specified for service entrance equipment, switchboard 
mains and feeders, distribution equipment, and motor 
control centers. Class L fuses provide effective branch-circuit 
protection for large motors, and can be used for 
short-circuit isolation of fire pump circuits. Class L 
fuses are relatively large and heavy, and may have 
voltage ratings between 300 and 600 volts. Such fuses 
may have an interrupting rating of 200,000 amperes rms 
symmetrical, and an ampere rating of about 600 to 2000 
amperes or more. Current Class L fuses include a pair of 
conductive elements at the opposite ends of the fuse. 
Several fusible elements are secured to and make 
electrical contact with each of the opposed conductive 
elements. A generally cylindrical housing encloses the 
fusible elements. Sand is placed within the generally 
cylindrical housing, and this sand acts as an arc-quenching 
medium. Upon meeting certain minimum 
standards, Class L fuses are listed under UL Standard 
198C promulgated by Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. 
(hereinafter "UL"). Class L fuses prior to the present invention 
had several drawbacks. First, no Class L fuse existed 
which had an equally high UL rating for alternating 
current (AC) and direct current (DC). For example, a 600 
volt, 1200 amp AC rated fuse typically had a DC rating of 
300 volts. The reasons for this are not entirely known. 
It appeared, however, that sand placed within the 
interior of prior art Class L fuses was adequate only for 
quenching the arcs generated by high voltage AC currents, 
and not those created by high voltage DC currents. A Class L fuse having both a 600 volt AC and a 
600 volt DC rating would be desirable. Such a fuse could 
lower the number of fuse models made by fuse 
manufacturers and the inventory requirements of these  
 
relatively expensive fuses for both manufacturers and 
users. A second drawback was that no known prior Class 
L DC fuse was UL rated at 600 volts. The highest rated 
Class L fuse previously known had a 500 volt rating. A third drawback of prior Class L fuses 
concerned their performance under overload conditions. 
As stated above,

ends of said fuse, and a housing (40) having a central 

portion (42) and end portions (44), said terminal-forming 
elements (12 and 14) having an inner wall (33) and an 

outer wall, a plurality of laterally-spaced fusible 
elements (28) secured between, and inserted into so as to 

make electrical contact with, the inner wall (33) of each
