<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to electromagnetic
vibrators, and more specifically to electromagnetic
vibrators comprising a resonant armature and used for
generating a tactile alert in a portable communications
receiver.Vibrators for generating tactile alerts in portable
communications receivers are well known. Early devices
comprised a motor driven offset mass for generating the
tactile alert. Disadvantageously, such devices tended to
have short lifetimes due to wear on bearings, commutators,
brushes, etc. Also, when the portable communications
receiver was worn on a person's body, the motor driven
tactile vibrator generated movement not only in a direction
useful for producing a tactile response, e.g., normal to
the body, but also in other less useful directions, e.g.,
parallel to the body. As a result, such vibrators
disadvantageously consumed large amounts of battery power
for the amount of tactile response the vibrators produced.As an improvement over the motor driven tactile
vibrator, a resonant armature tactile vibrator has been
developed that uses a movable mass suspended by a single
planar spring suspension element and incorporates an
axially polarized permanent magnet driven by an
electromagnetic means to effect a vibration in a
fundamental mode. Such a vibrator is known from US-A-5 107 540. This conventional resonant armature
tactile vibrator overcomes many of the problems of the
motor driven tactile vibrator, but has attendant
limitations of its own. One such limitation is that, for
mechanical clearance reasons during operation, the amount
of vibrating mass that can be suspended by the planar 
spring suspension element for a given device volume is
relatively small, thus requiring a relatively large device
to produce a sufficiently strong tactile vibration.
Another limitation is that the range of possible resonant
frequencies is restricted by the thickness and displacement
relationships of the single planar spring suspension
element.A further limitation to the performance of the
conventional resonant armature tactile vibrator results
from a critical coupling of the fundamental mode of
vibration to other, spurious modes of vibration. The
critical coupling exists because the design using a movable
mass suspended by a single planar spring suspension element
exhibits a torsional (second mode) resonant frequency that
is very close to the resonant frequency of the fundamental
mode. The second mode vibration that results from the
critical coupling reduces the amplitude of the desired
fundamental
