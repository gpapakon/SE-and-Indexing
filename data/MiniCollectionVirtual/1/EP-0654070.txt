<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic hot-melt-type adhesive based on a polymer blend of polyolefins is disclosed. An oligomer of an (alpha)-olefin with at least 4 C atoms in the monomer and a molecular weight of the oligomer of up to 5,000, as well as other known additives, are added to the known mixture of a largely amorphous poly-(alpha)-olefin and of a largely crystalline poly-(alpha)-olefin. The impact strength, the viscosity and the flexibility at low temperatures are above all improved in this manner. These hot-melt-type adhesives are therefore suitable above all for glueing non-polar plastics in the automobile and electric industry.

<CLAIMS>
A thermoplastic hotmelt adhesive based on a polymer blend of
polyolefins, characterized by the following components:


A) a substantially amorphous poly-α-olefin with a degree of
crystallization of 
<
30%,
B) a substantially crystalline poly-α-olefin with a degree of
crystallization of 
>
55%, as determined with DDK against a highly
crystalline poly-α-olefin standard and
C) an oligomer of an α-olefin containing 8 to 16 carbon atoms in the
monomer with a molecular weight (of the oligomer) of up to 5,000

and typical additives.
A hotmelt adhesive as claimed in claim 1, characterized by a
homopolymer or copolymer, more particularly a terpolymer of the monomer

components ethylene, propylene and butylene, as the substantially
amorphous poly-α-olefin with a molecular weight of more than 5,000.
A hotmelt adhesive as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the substantially amorphous poly-α-olefin and/or the substantially

crystalline poly-α-olefin contain functional groups, for example grafted-on
maleic anhydride.
A hotmelt adhesive as claimed in claim 2 or 3, characterized by an
isotactic polypropylene as the substantially crystalline poly-α-olefin with a

molecular weight of more than 5,000.
A hotmelt adhesive as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized by an oligomer of an α-olefin containing 8 to 16 carbon

atoms in the dimer, more particularly by a dimer, trimer or tetramer of dec-1-ene.
A hotmelt adhesive as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized by the composition of the polymer blend, the amorphous

polyolefin making up 35 to 45% by weight, the crystalline polyolefin making 
up 10 to 20% by weight and the oligo-α-olefin making up 7 to 15% by

weight, based on the polymer blend as a whole.
The use of the hotmelt adhesive claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 6 for bonding apolar plastics, more particularly of polypropylene and

polyethylene, preferably in the automotive and electrical industries and in

the construction of plastic pipelines.
The use of the oligo-α-olefin according to claim 1, 5 or 6 for the
production of the polymer blend according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4.
