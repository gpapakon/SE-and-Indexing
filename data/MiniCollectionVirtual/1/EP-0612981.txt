<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new method of deducing an 
angular velocity signal of a phase-modulated fiber-optic gyroscope. 
A fiber-optic gyroscope obtains an angular velocity by dividing 
light beams emitted from a light source in halves, introducing the 
divided beams to both ends of a fiber coil, propagating the light 
beams clockwise and counterclockwise in the fiber coil, letting the 
clockwise beams and the counterclockwise beams interfere, 
measuring the intensity of the interfering beams by a photodiode 
and detecting a phase difference of the clockwise beams and 
counterclockwise beams. The angular velocity of the fiber coil is 
in proportion to the phase difference. The angular velocity is 
obtained from the phase difference Δϑ between the clockwise 
waves (CW) and the counterclockwise (CCW) waves. Without modulation, a small phase difference were not 
sensitively measured and the sign (positive or negative) of the  
 
phase difference could not be determined, because the phase 
difference was included in the form of cosΔϑ in the output signal 
of a photodetector. Thus, some form of modulation is applied to 
the light waves spreading in a fiber path. For example, 
phase-modulation, frequency modulation and phase shift modulation. This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Applications No.61169/1993 filed February 24, 1993 and No.13145/1994 
filed January 10, 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to a new method for detecting 
the phase difference Δϑ from a phase-modulated gyroscope. Thus, 
a phase-modulated gyroscope will be now explained by Fig.ll. A 
light source emits light beams. The light beams ( waves ) enter an 
end of a single-mode fiber, pass through a first coupler and attain 
a polarizer P. The light waves are converted into 
linearly-polarized waves. The polarized waves are divided into 
halves by a second coupler. The divided waves are introduced to 
two ends of a fiber coil of a single-mode fiber wound a plurality of 
turns around a bobbin. The divided, partial waves propagate 
clockwise and counterclockwise in the fiber coil. No phase 
difference occurs between the clockwise spreading waves and the 
counterclockwise spreading waves, when the fiber coil is at rest.  However, when the fiber coil rotates, some phase 
difference occurs between the clockwise waves and the 
counterclockwise waves in proportion to the angular velocity of 
the fiber coil. The coupler combines the once divided clockwise 
and counterclockwise waves
