<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a controlling system for a horizontal continuous casting plant with a heat-retaining vessel (1) designed as a pressure chamber. Liquid metal can be fed to the heat-retaining vessel via a filling channel (3), the metal being heatable to a predetermined temperature and passed via a feed channel (7) with a discharge opening (8) to a continuous casting mould (10). As an extension of the feed channel (7), a discharge channel (9) is provided above the discharge opening and the molten-metal level (H4) in the discharge channel can be adjusted to a predetermined value by appropriate adjustment of the gas pressure in the heat-retaining vessel. The maximum permissible molten-metal level (H2) in the heat-retaining vessel (1) is specified such that the liquid-metal volumes (V1, V3) flowing from the filling channel (3) and from the discharge channel (9) via the feed channel (7) into the heat-retaining vessel after a pressure reduction has been carried out in the heat-retaining vessel result in a molten-metal level which is lower than or equal to the molten-metal level (H3) at the level of the discharge opening (8).
