<ABSTRACT>
Device for heating a gaseous fluid, which comprises at least two cells (A; B) which are joined together by a central part, the whole being lined with a thermal mass (3), which is equipped with means for introducing the gaseous fluid to be heated, means for extracting the heated gaseous fluid, means for introducing a hot heating gas and means for removing the cooled heating gas. The means for introducing the hot heating gas consist of a distributor (22), which is common to the cells (A) and (B), arranged in the aforementioned central part. The means for extracting the heated gaseous fluid comprise a pipe (6) connected to a manifold (15) which also opens into the central part of the device. The distributor (22) and the manifold (15) are preferably each composed of at least one perforated peripheral channel segment. A deflector (baffle) (24) arranged between the distributor (22) and the manifold (15) separates the gas streams.
