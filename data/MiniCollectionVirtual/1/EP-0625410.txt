<ABSTRACT>
A micromanipulator comprises a pair of hand 
modules (1) each of which includes a circular base plate 

(2) with three connection points (16), an end-effector (3) 
consisting of a circular moving plate (4) and a finger (5) 

attached to the moving plate, the moving plate being 
disposed above the base plate and having three connection 

points (17) offset 60 degrees from those of the base plate, 
six metal links (6) disposed between the base plate and the 

moving plate, six actuators (15) provided on the six metal 
links for extending and contracting them, six first metal 

wire members (11) connected between one end of the six 
metal links and the three connection points of the base 

plate so that two wire members are connected with each 
connection point of the base plate to be inclined in 

opposite directions, and six second metal wire members (11) 
connected between the other end of the metal links and the 

three connection points of the moving plate so that two 
wire members are connected with each connection point of 

the moving plate to be inclined in opposite directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a micromanipulator 
adapted for use in fields requiring precise positioning on 
the µm order, particularly for use in the integrated 
circuit (IC) industry (for precision wafer positioning), 
bioengineering, medicine (microsurgery), satellite 
communications (precise antenna positioning) etc. Micromanipulation is the technology of conducting 
operations on minute objects (for example, cells) with 
sizes on the order of several tens of µm. It can be 
effectively applied, for instance, for grasping a minute 
object with two fingers and positioning it by transational 
and rotational motion, as well as for operations such as 
gripping, pressing, cutting, stretching, compressing, 
perforating, mixing and propelling. As such, it has become 
an indispensable technology in a wide range of fields 
including biotechnology and medicine. However, since most 
of the micromanipulators that have become commercially 
available up to the present consist of a combination of a 
mechanism for transnational motion in three mutually 
perpendicular directions and a gripper, they are not 
optimally adapted for use with microscopic objects. In view of these circumstances and in light of 
the fact that in the microworld surface forces are dominant  
 
over inertial force, the inventor concluded that a two-finger 
microhand would be capable of sufficiently stable 
micromanipulation. He therefore developed a two-finger 
hand with a drive mechanism utilizing parallel linkages 
with six degrees of freedom (DOF). This micromanipulator, 
which is described in Japanese Patent Application Hei 
3(1991)-305,220, was confirmed to be highly effective as 
regards operability, controllability and the like. This earlier proposed micromanipulator is 
constituted as a two-finger hand employing a pair of hand 
modules with 6-DOF parallel linkages. Each hand module has 
a base plate and an end-effector consisting of a moving 
plate and a finger attached to the moving plate. The base 
plate and the moving plate are connected by six links that 
are extended and contracted by piezoelectric actuators. 
The six links are divided into two groups of three each. 
The links of both groups are connected with the base plate 
and the moving plate at points spaced along circles whose 
centers are the axial centers of the plates, but the links 
of one group are inclined in the opposite direction from 
those of the other group. Since the need for the 
micromanipulator to be compact makes it difficult to use 
ball joints or the like for
