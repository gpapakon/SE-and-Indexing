Component, more particularly a component adapted to
be highly stressed mechanically to an operating

temperature of up to 900°C and having long-term
resistance to oxidation and corrosion, based on

intermetallic phases of the system titanium-aluminium
with an aluminium content of between 42 At% and 53

At%,

characterised in that this component surface is
configured to have a lamellar, eutectoid Ti
3
Al/TiAl
structure which is limited only to the surface zone.
Process for producing components adapted to be highly
stressed mechanically and having long-term resistance

to oxidation and corrosion, based on intermetallic
phases of the system titanium-aluminium with an

aluminium content of between 42 At% and 53 At%,

characterised in that the titanium-aluminium melt or
a heat-treated component of titanium aluminide is

heat-treated at a temperature in or as near as
possible to the stability range of the α-titanium in

the titanium-aluminium phase plot and is subsequently
quenched in such a way as to form a lamellar,

eutectoid Ti
3
Al/TiAl structure on the component
surface as an alloy structure which is limited only

to said surface zone.
Process according to claim 2,

characterised in that a heat treatment temperature of
1300°C to 1430°C is chosen, more particularly 1400°C.
Process according to either of claims 2 and 3,

characterised in that the heat treatment lasts for up
to four hours, more particularly 30 minutes to four

hours. 
Process according to any of claims 2 to 4,

characterised in that the surface of the component
that has already been heat-treated is heat-treated

with an incomplete eutectoid Ti
3
Al/TiAl structure,
more particularly with said structure having

partially been removed.
Process according to any of claims 2 to 5,

characterised in that the component surface is heat-treated
in a locally defined manner.
Process according to any of claims 2 to 6,

characterised in that the heat-treatment involves the
use of a laser, an electron beam or a high-frequency

induction coil, or a combination of these methods.
Process according to any of claims 2 to 7,

characterised in that in the case where the heat-treatment
of the component involves a high-frequency

induction coil, the component is moved through the
coil at a suitable speed in dependence on the desired

depth of penetration of the surface structure
incorporating the finely lamellar, eutectoid

Ti
3
Al/TiAl struture, locally defined if appropriate.
