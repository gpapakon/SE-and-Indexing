<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a method of producing mineral-wool slabs with a higher-density layer on the upper and/or lower surface. The method is characterized in that a continuous strip of mineral wool with an uncured binder is conveyed continuously along a conveyor track and is subjected at at least one point along the conveyor track to high-frequency mechanical-impact treatment. The strip of mineral wool is subsequently fed to an oven to cure the binder and then divided into slabs.

Method of producing slabs of mineral wool, said slabs 
comprising a compacted layer on the upper and/or underside 

thereof, characterized in that a web of mineral wool (1) 
comprising a non-cured bonding agent is continuously conveyed 

and subject on one location of the conveying path to mechanical 
beating at a high frequency of beats, that the web of 

mineral wool (1) is subsequently fed to a hardening furnace 
for curing the bonding agent, and thereafter is divided into 

slabs. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
frequency of beats is selected to be between approx 500/min 

to 6000/min. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
mineral wool having a bulk density or volume weight of approx 

15 to 200 kg/m
3
 is selected. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the mineral fibers within the web of 

mineral wool (1) extend essentially parallel or at an acute 
angle to the large surfaces of the web. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the conveying speed of the web of 

mineral wool (1) is selected to be approx 0.5 to 30 m/min, 
and that the frequency of beats is adapted to said conveying 

speed. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to any 
one of the preceding claims, wherein a continuously driven 

conveying means (10, 11) for a web of mineral wool (1) which 
contains a non-cured bonding agent has associated to it a 

beating device (2) adapted to exert mechanical beats at a 
high frequency to the upper and/or underside of the web of  

 
mineral wool (1), that the beating device (2) is topped with 

a hardening furnace, and that said hardening furnace is 
followed by a slab cutting device. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the beating device (2) is adapted to be adjustable in height. 
Apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the frequency of beats can be adjusted or regulated 

between approx 500/min to 6000/min. 
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the length of stroke of the beating 

device (2) can be adjusted or regulated corresponding to the 
thickness of the layer to be compacted. 
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that the beating device (2) has a motor 

drive comprising an eccentric and a lifting rod. 
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that the beating device (2) comprises a 

hydraulic or pneumatic drive. 
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 6 to 11, 
characterized in that the beating device (2) comprises a 

beater blade (3, 13, 18, 22) that penetrates into the web of 
mineral wool. 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the beater blade (3, 13, 18, 22) is arranged transversely of 

the web of mineral wool (1) and is movable within a plane 
perpendicular to the large surfaces of the web of mineral 

wool (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the direction of stroke of the beater blade (3, 13, 18, 22)  

 
is adjustable relative to the web of mineral wool (1) within 

an angle range on both sides up to approx 30Â° to the perpendicular. 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the length (6) of the beater blade (3) corresponds to the 

width of the web of mineral wool (1), and that the beater 
blade (3) has a rectangular cross section and a width (4) of 

approx 1 to 50 mm as well as a height (5) of approx 10 to 500 
mm. 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the beater blade (3, 13, 18, 22) is comprised of hardened 

metal or hard metal. 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the beater blade (13, 18, 22) has a trapezoidal or sector-like 

cross section with a surface (14, 19, 23) upwardly 
sloping in a direction opposite to the conveying direction 

(12) of the web of mineral wool (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 17, characterized in that 
the upwardly sloping surface
 (14, 19) of the beater blade 
(13, 18), particularly in the upper part thereof, is formed 

to be stairlike or ribbed or corrugated (20). 
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 6 to 18, 
characterized in that the beating device (2), within the 

range of a complete production system, is arranged between a 
precompacting device, wherein the web of mineral wool (1) is 

uniformly compacted throughout its cross section, and the 
hardening furnace in a manner to be run in and run out.
