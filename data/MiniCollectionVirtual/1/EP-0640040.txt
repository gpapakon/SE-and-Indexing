<DESCRIPTION>
 STATIC DISSIPATIVE LAMINATE CONTAINING STAINLESS STEEL FIBERSThe present invention relates to static dissipative laminates especially suitable as work top surfaces for assembly of electronic components. The present invention more particularly relates to static dissipative laminates having a stainless steel fiber- containing layer in its core.Continuing interest exists for static dissipative and electrically conductive laminates for use in various environments, including static dissipative work surfaces and conductive flooring materials. Among the prior patents of interest are the U.S. patents to Economy et al 3,567,689; eiser 3,650,821; Wilks et al 3,922,383; Cannady 4,540,624; Berbeco 4,454,199 and 4,455,350; Grosheim et al 4,472,474; Cannady et al 4,480,001; and Ungar et al 4,784,908 and 4,724,187. Of particular interest are the patents directed to the use of carbon black filled paper, noting the patents of Economy et al, Meiser, and Ungar et al.The difference between the static electrical properties of static dissipative and conductive material is measured by the surface resistivity (in ohms/square) . The U.S.A. Department of Defense defines the electrical properties as follows:Anti-static : greater than 109 Static dissipative: between 106 and 109 Conductive : less than 106.A static dissipative environment having a resistivity on the order of about 106 to 109 ohms/square is needed for a work surface for the assembly and repair of electronic components. Electronic components often pick up charges in dry air. When the component is placed on a surface, the charge is discharged, destroying o damaging the component. If the work surface is static 

dissipative and connected to a ground, the charge will leak off and the damage can be avoided.Standard high pressure decorative laminates have a surface resistivity of about 1011 to 1013 ohms/square. If the work surface resistivity is too high an electrostatic discharge can occur, destroying the electrical components. If the work top resistivity is too low, less than 106 ohms, it becomes a safety hazard for electrical shock as well as a source of damage to electronic components. No particular surface product is suitable for all static dissipative and conductive environments as different usages and different environments require different properties.Static dissipative laminates prior to that of the Ungar et al U.S. patent 4,784,908 suffered from other disadvantages in addition to being too conductive or not conductive enough. Some laminates have an upper surface
