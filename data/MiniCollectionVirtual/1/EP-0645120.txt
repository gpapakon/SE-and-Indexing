<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a protective 
carpal tunnel grooved director catheter device 10 which is 

housed in a protective case 30. 
The grooved guide director device is constructed with 
a tubular member 12 with a blunt distal end 20 and a handle 

14 secured to the tubular member. The tubular member 
defines a lumen 16 which terminates at the distal end of 

the tubular member in a blind bore 17 and the handle 
defines a throughgoing lumen axially aligned with the 

tubular member lumen. A cut out section 22 is provided in 
the tubular member opening the tubular member lumen to the 

atmosphere to form a groove 23 for a balloon catheter 24 
which is mounted in the lumen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus
used in surgical procedures such as Carpal Tunnel
Syndrome. Apparatus in accordance with the pre-characterising
part of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-5179963.It is a frequent practice when introducing balloon
catheters and other catheters or instruments into the body
to first introduce a cannula or sheath to aid in the
introduction of the catheter or other instruments. The
present invention is directed to a
catheter director apparatus used in surgical procedures such
as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which increases the spatial
diameter of the carpal tunnel enclosing the nerve.Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been
treated nonsurgically by splinting of the affected hand and
wrist, oral anti-inflammatory medication, and local steroid
injection. If nonsurgical methods are unsuccessful,
surgical intervention is required.Open surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel
by division of the transverse carpal ligament was first
described in 1930 by Learmonth. Open procedures generally
entail a curved longitudinal incision parallel to the thenar
crease. Taleisnik has described an incision along the ulnar 
border of the ring finger axis (Taleisnik, J.: The palmar
cutaneous branch of the median nerve and the approach to the
carpal tunnel: An anatomical study; J. Bone Joint Surg,
55A: 1212, 1973). This incision may be extended proximally
to the wrist flexor crease. Angling the incision towards the
ulnar aspect of the wrist helps to avoid cutting the palmar
sensory cutaneous branch of the median nerve. This nerve is
located in the interval between the palmaris longus and the
flexor carpi radialis tendons. After division of the skin
and subcutaneous tissue, the transverse carpal ligament is
identified and divided along its ulnar border to avoid and
to prevent injury to the median nerve or its recurrent
branch. It is to this application that the present
director device has been developed.In contrast, EP-A-552980 describes apparatus for
release of the carpal ligament. An endoscope is used to
position a cannula. The cannula then receives a knife
which is used to cut the ligament.Various patents disclose devices for inserting or
placing catheters within chosen parts of the human body.
U.S. Patent No. 4,655,214 discloses a soft inflatable sheath
having a closed rounded distal tip that is inserted through
a catheter and inflated adjacent the distal tip of the
catheter prior to intubation. The proximal end of the sheath
is sealed to maintain it in expanded inflatable
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A surgical apparatus to assist in dilating tissue
which comprises:


a substantially rigid member dimensioned to be
inserted through tissue and having a proximal and distal

end portions, said member defining a catheter guide; and
a catheter which co-operates in use with the
rigid member

said catheter
including an elongated member defining a passageway for

passage of fluids and an expandable member in communication
with said passageway, wherein said expandable member is

expandable to a predetermined configuration in response to
inflation thereof, said apparatus being 

characterised in that:

i. said rigid member is tubular and has a lumen extending
therethrough and terminating at said distal end portion

thereof to form a blind bore (17), an outer wall portion of
said tubular member defining an opening in communication

with said lumen and
ii. in use, said catheter is at least partially supported
within said lumen of said tubular member,

said expandable member positioned
adjacent said opening in said outer wall portion

wherein said expandable member when in

said predetermined configuration extends outwardly through
said opening in said outer wall of said tubular member to

engage and dilate adjacent tissue.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
opening in said outer wall portion is disposed intermediate

said proximal and distal end portion of said tubular
member.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said
distal end portion of said tubular member defines a distal

most blunt closed tip, said blunt closed tip engaging said
distal end of said catheter upon positioning of said

catheter within said lumen to prevent further axial
movement of said catheter. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said catheter is connected to

said tubular member and wherein said expandable member is
positioned adjacent said opening.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein said
expandable member is secured to said tubular member at a

position adjacent said opening.
The apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said proximal end portion of said

tubular member has a handle dimensioned to facilitate
handling of said tubular member.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein said
handle includes a lumen in general alignment with and in

communication with said lumen of said tubular member.
The device as claimed in claim 6 or 7, wherein
said handle is disc shaped.
The device as claimed in claims 6, 7 or 8,
wherein said catheter has a proximal end which extends

outside of said handle member, and said proximal end
includes a connector means mounted thereto.
The apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said expandable member is a

balloon member axially secured to said tubular member at a
position fixed adjacent said opening of said tubular

member.
The device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims wherein said tubular member is stepped so that the

distal step portion is of a lesser diameter then the
proximal step portion.
