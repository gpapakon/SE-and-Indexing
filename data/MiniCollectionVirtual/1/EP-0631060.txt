<ABSTRACT>
A self-aligning bearing for a fractional-horsepower PMDC electric motor is formed 
from sheet metal coated with polytetrafluoroethylene to facilitate intermittent, short-term 

operation. A tubular first part (1) provides a journal-bearing surface (4). A 
second part (5) extends radially from a first end (2) of the first part (1) to provide 

radial support for the first part (1). A third part (8) is connected to and diverges 
radially from the second end (3) of the first part (1) for engagement with an abutment 

surface (17) of a bearing support (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bearings for fractional-horsepower PMDC electric motors having 
shafts of typically, 2 to 4 mm diameter. These bearings can be produced from sheet 
metal and then coated on their rotary load bearing surfaces with friction-reducing 
material. Bearings such as these are particularly, but not exclusively, suitable for use 
as self-aligning bearings. A bearing for a fractional-horsepower PMDC electric motor conventionally comprises 
a first part having axially spaced first and second ends and providing a journal- bearing 
surface, a second part having radially inner and outer first and second ends which is 
connected to the first part and provides radial support for the first part, and a third part 
for engagement with a bearing support. Thus, for a self-aligning bearing having a 
cylindrical journal-bearing surface and a part-spherical outer surface engageable with 
the bearing support, the first, second and third parts constitute radially inner, 
intermediate and outer parts of a ring member and, to provide lubrication, the ring 
member is normally formed from sintered material which is sufficiently porous to hold, 
typically, up to 20% of its volume of lubricating oil. Bearings of this construction function quite satisfactorily, but the cost of manufacture 
is significant, particularly where the outer surfaces of the bearings have to be part-spherical 
for self-aligning purposes. Moreover, in some applications, for example: car 
door locking motors, where the motor is only required to operate intermittently for a 
small number of revolutions the major problem is reducing static friction, or "stiction". 
There is insufficient time to develop a friction-reducing oil film and so the cost of 
providing a lubrication bearing is wasted. In fact, the presence of oil which does little 
to reduce friction can cause damage by flowing onto the contact surfaces of the 
commutator because, as a result of the limited operation of the motor, there is 
insufficient heat to burn this oil to thereby prevent the formation of an insulating 
coating. DE 3332323 discloses a self-aligning bearing made from sheet metal. The bearing has 
a hollow, cylindrical portion forming the journal bearing surface, and a dish-shaped 
portion formed at one end of the cylindrical portion and extending axially towards the 
other end. The dish-shaped portion has a convex part-spherical outer surface for 
bearing against a complementary surface of the bearing housing. A multi-fingered  
 
spring fixed to the bearing

<CLAIMS>
A self-aligning bearing assembly for a fractional horsepower PMDC electric 
motor comprising a bearing support (9) having a circular section aperture (18) 

a radially extending support surface (16) formed 
at one end of the aperture (18) 

and an abutment surface (17) formed on the other 
end of the aperture (18) and a 

sheet metal bearing having a tubular first part (1), disposed within the aperture (18), 
with axially spaced first and second ends (2,3) and a journal bearing surface (4), a second part (5) having a first end (6) 

connected to the first end (2) of the first part (1) and a radially outer second end (7), 
and a third part (8) connected to the second end (3) of the first part (1) and diverging radially outward from the second end (3) 

of the first part (1), characterised 
in that the journal bearing surface (4) is coated 

with a non-liquid friction-reducing material ; the aperture (18) 
tapers radially inward from the support surface (16) 

to the abutment surface (17); and in that
 
   the third part (8) of the bearing engages the abutment surface (17) and thereby holds the 

second part (5) of the bearing in frictional contact with the support surface (16) of the 
bearing support (9) so as to provide radial support for the first 

end of the first part. 
A bearing assembly according to claim 1 wherein the resilience of the 
bearing support, the resilience of the bearing and the outer diameter of the third part 

(8) of the bearing are such that the third part (8) can pass through the aperture (18) 
and snap into position.  

 
A bearing assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the non-liquid 
friction-reducing material is an electroless codeposit comprising fluorocarbon polymer 

particles dispersed within a layer of nickel.
