<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates primarily to the field of optically active lactones of formula (I) as defined below. The invention relates also to the utilisation of compounds of formula (I) so obtained as perfuming or flavoring ingredients. The process for producing the individual optically active lactones of formula (I), wherein the asterisk indicates a chirality center, n stands for zero or 1, R represents a C5- or C6-alkyl radical, which optionally may contain an additional double bond of either Z- or E-configuration, such additional bond being compulsory in case of n = 0, comprises the stereoselective enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester bond of the corresponding racemates in the presence of an esterase, recovering the enzyme-spared isomer, and, if desired, subjecting the hydrolysed isomer to lactonisation, provided the enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of potassium ions in case of n = 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICALLY ACTIVE LACTONESThe present invention relates primarily to the field of optically active lactones of formula Ias defined below.More exactly, the present invention provides an enzymatic process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I, which are strongly enriched in either the R- or the S- enantiomer, i.e. exhibiting optical purities of at least 50% ee.The invention relates also to the utilization of compounds of formula I so obtained as perfuming or flavoring ingredients.The process for producing the individual optically active lactones of formula IIwherein the asterisk indicates a chirality center, n stands for zero or 1, R represents a C5-or C6-alkyl radical, which optionally may contain an additional double bond of either Z- or E-configuration, such additional bond being compulsory in case of n = 0, comprises the stereoselective enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester bond of the corresponding racemates in the presenceUr/ 10.9.93 

of an esterase, recovering the enzyme - spared isomer, and, if desired, subjecting the hydrolysed isomer to lactonisation,provided the enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of potassium ions in case of n = 1.In the following table, the material products are depicted.
 (+) - (R) (-) - (S) δ-delactone2a 2b6 a 6b 
(-) - (S)(-) - (S)
 9bExcept for Jasmolactone (a synthetically prepared racemic lactone), all lactones mentioned in this context are known to occur naturally in either the R- and/or the S- configurated form.For instance, (-)-(R)-δ-jasmine lactone 2 is found in jasmine oil [Winter M. et al., Helv. Chim. Acta. A5.. 1250, 1962], whereas its (+)-(S) counterpart 2a is found in tuberose oil [Kaiser R., and Lamparsky D., Tetrahedron Lett. 2SL, 1659, 1976] together with (-)-(R)-tuberolactone £a, (-)-(R)-massoϊalactone 5a, and (+)-(R)-δ-decalactone 2a.γ-Jasmine lactone (Z-dec-7-en-4-olide) of unspecified absolute configuration was found in jasmine oil [Stoffelsma J., Sipma G., Brouwer H., and Cohen A.M., Joint symposium on recent advances in perfumery, 1973, British Soc. of Perfumers; cited by Garnero J., Joulain D., and Bui1 P., Riv. Ital. EPPOS. £1 (1),8, 1980].The natural occurrence of (+)-(S)-tuberolactone £ and (+)-(S)-massoϊalactone 5 has not been described in the literature. Actually, more and more examples become known, where the two enantiomeric forms of chiral compounds exhibit different organoleptic properties [for a recent review see Pickenhagen W., in Flavor chemistry,

CLAIMS
1. A process for producing optically active lactones of formula
I wherein the asterisk indicates a chirality center, n stands for zero or 1; R represents a C
5
- or Cβ-alkyl radical, which optionally may contain an additional double bond of either Z- or E-configuration, such additional bond being compulsory in case of n = 0, comprising the stereoselective enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester bond of the corresponding racemates in the presence of an esterase, recovering the enzyme - spared isomer, and, if desired, subjecting the hydrolysed isomer to lactonisation, provided the enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of potassium ions in case of n = 1.
2. A process according to claim 1, wherein the enzyme is an esterase, e.g. a lipase or a enzymatic extract containing the same, preferably horse liver esterase, pig pancreatic lipase or pig liver esterase.
3. A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein in formula I n stands for 1 and an alkenyl side chain is a pentenyl group, preferably (Z)-2- pentenyl or (E)-3-pentenyl.
4. A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein in formula I n stands for 0 and an alkenyl side chain is a hexenyl group, preferably (Z)-3- hexenyl.
5. A process for producing the optically active α,β- unsaturated δ-decalactones of formula I' 

r
wherein the side chain may contain an additional double bond as indicated by the dotted line comprising the additional step of introducing a ring unsaturation into the saturated δ-lactones of formula I as prepared according to any one of claims 1 to 4.
6. A process according to claim 5 wherein the double bond is introduced according to Tsuji, e.g. via formation of the corresponding allyl β-oxo esters of I followed by their palladium-catalyzed oxidative decarboxylation.
7. A perfume and/or flavour composition, containing at least a compound I of claim 1, prepared according to the process of any one of claims 1 to 6.
