<ABSTRACT>
A simplified layered imaging stack capable of bearing a latent photostatic image comprising only a single segmented electrode on one side of the stack, rather than plate electrodes on each side of the stack. Appropriate sizing of the segmented electrodes enables individual electrodes to serve at different times as either the ground reference formerly provided by the electrode on the other side of the stack, or the collector of charge carriers representing the latent photostatic image. The imaging stack may be used with a variety of types of imaging systems, and in flat or cylindrical configurations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMAGING SYSTEM AND DEVICE HAVING A SIMPLIFIED ELECTRODE DESIGNTechnical Field This invention relates to systems for producing images, and especially those systems which use photoconductive materials to absorb radiation to create a latent image, followed by a selective detection of the latent image in the photoconductive material.Background One type of imaging system employs photoconductive materials to absorb incident radiation representative of an image of an object. Suitable photoconductive materials will absorb the radiation and produce electron-hole pairs (charge carriers) which may be separated from each other by an electric field applied across the photoconductor, creating a latent image at the surface of the photoconductor (which is typically a thin planar layer). A narrow beam of scanning radiation substantially completes discharge of the photoconductor, by creating motion of a second set of charge carriers. The distribution of these second charge carriers in the plane of the photoconductor is affected by the distribution of the first charge carriers, i.e., by the latent image. The motion of the second charge carriers is detected and digitized in an appropriate circuit, and thus the latent image is captured in digital form. In one specific embodiment, the photoconductor is part of a multilayer structure comprising two electrodes, between which are the photoconductive layer and an insulating layer. A high voltage power supply maintains electric fields in the structure during exposures to the incident radiation and the scanning radiation (although not necessarily the same field strength is present during each exposure). An example of this type of system is taught in U.S. Patent 4,176,275 (Kom et al.).A second and closely related approach, known as the air-gap photoinduced discharge (PID) method, employs air as the insulating layer, and requires that a uniform separation be maintained between the two electrodes, typically by high-precision mechanical or piezoelectric devices. A corona charges the surface of the photoconductor prior to exposure to radiation, producing an electric field in the material. Thus, the incident radiation partially discharges the surface to 

produce a latent image, and the read-out signal is induced by the charge motion under the influence of the residual electric field in response to the scanning radiation. Such a system is described in Rowlands et al., Med. Phys. 18(3), May/Jun 1991 at 421-431. Various methods for scanning the latent image exist. For example, the method

(b) means for charging a first surface of the photoconductive insulative layer such that first charge carriers created in the imaging device by first incident radiation are subsequently separated to create a first current, resulting in the formation of a latent electrostatic image near the charged first surface of the photoconductive insulative layer;
