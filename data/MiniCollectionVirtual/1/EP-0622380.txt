<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns crystalline propylene polymers having an MFR (Melt Flow Rate according to ASTM D 123BL) ranging from 600 to 2000 g/10 min, and P.I. (Polydispersity Index) values lower than or equal to 3.7.Crystalline propylene polymers having high MFR values, generally ranging from 300 to 1500 g/10 min, have found in recent years consistent use in some application sectors, thanks above all to their high fluidity in the molten state, and their good mechanical characteristics. Examples of said application sectors are the one concerning webs for nonwoven fabrics obtained by various processes for forming nonwoven webs, such as air-laid or carding processes, especially by way of melt blown or spun-bonded processes, or the one concerning composites with highly porous organic fillers, such as wood flour.Crystalline propylene polymers having the above MFR characteristics have been prepared, up to now, by using two types of processes. The most commonly used one is based on thermodegradation (visbreaking) of crystalline propylene polymers obtained with stereospecific catalysts (Ziegler-Natta) and generally having MFR values ranging from 1 to 100, in particular from 1 to 10. Said thermodegradation process is carried out maintaining the polymers in the molten state, generally at temperatures ranging from 200 to 300°C, in the presence of radical generators, such as organic peroxides (such as 2,5-dimethyl-2,5[tert-butylperoxy]hexane, for example).Thus the polymer chains are degraded in segments whose length can be controlled by choosing the proper conditions for the thermodegradation process. However, the above process has the disadvantage of altering considerably the physical and chemical structure of the initial propylene. In fact, the high MFR polymers obtained with said process present particularly low Mw and Mz molecular weight average values (measured by way of GPC - Gel Permeation Chromatography and the resulting MWD curves). Consequently there is a considerable decline of the physico-mechanical properties related to the molecular weights, such as flexural modulus and tensile properties.Moreover, due to the high temperatures used and the presence of radicals, the above process causes secondary reactions that can bring to the formation of branched polymer chains containing double bonds.Furthermore, commercial production of such high MFR polymers with the use of extruders is not economical due to extrusion and pelletization difficulties. Consistent product quality is also difficult to achieve
