<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a connector for connecting 
a branch conductor (W
S
) to an insulated double core cable 
(W
M
) without cutting the cable or stripping the insulation 
from the cable. The connector includes a connecting 

element (14,34) adapted to pierce the cable insulation to 
contact the conducting core and a insulative wedge (35) 

adjacent the connecting element which pierces the cable 
insulation to maintain the conductive cores of the 

cable apart from one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulation 
displacement connector apparatus. In domestic low-voltage wiring, one form of wiring 
is a double-core flat cable insulated with vinyl 
insulation (referred to as VVF cable), in which two 
insulated electric wires extend in parallel and are 
surrounded by a sheath (protection cover) of a 
generally oval shape. To extend a branch electric wire from such a VVF 
cable two connections discussed below are selectively 
used; (1) a sleeve comprised of a metal tube which is 
provided, on an inner peripheral surface with a helical 
groove (see Japanese Utility Kokoku Publication No. 53-3418), 
and (2) a connector having a connecting element 
which pierces the insulation of the electric wires 
which are inserted in respective parallel circular 
holes, so that the connecting element comes into 
electrical contact with the electric wires to establish 
an electrical connection therebetween (see Japanese 
Patent Kokai Publication No. 51-1992). In the branching operation using the sleeve 
mentioned above, the VVF cable is cut to remove the 
sheath and the insulation to expose the electric wire. 
If the branch conductor is made of a similar VVF cable, 
the latter is similarly cut to remove the sheath and 
the insulation. If the branch conductor is a single 
wire, the insulation thereof is removed to expose the  
 
conductor. Thereafter, the exposed conductor portion 
of the main conductor and the exposed conductor portion 
of the branch conductor are forced into the sleeve to 
connect them. In the branching operation using the connector, 
the sheath of the VVF cable of the main conductor is 
removed to produce two portions corresponding to the 
electric wires. If the branch electric wire is made of 
the VVF cable, the sheath thereof is removed, and if 
the branch conductor is made of a single wire, no 
operation is needed. After that, one of the portions 
corresponding to the electric wires of the main 
conductor and the corresponding electrical wire or the 
portion equivalent thereto of the branch conductor are 
inserted in the respective holes of the connector. 
After that the connecting element is mounted to the 
connector body to pierce the insulation of the electric 
wires to thereby establish an electrical connection 
therebetween. Similarly to the foregoing, another 
connecting element is mounted to the connector body to 
electrically connect the other portion corresponding to 
the electrical wire of the main conductor and the 
corresponding electric wire or the

<CLAIMS>
A connector for electrically connecting at 
least one conductor of a cable having at least two 

electrical conductors electrically insulated from each 
other by a unitary sheath of insulative material to at 

least one branch conductor, said connector comprising: 
   a housing including a cable insertion portion in 

which the cable may be inserted, at least one branch 
conductor inserting portion in which a branch conductor 

may be inserted, and a connecting element inserting 
portion; 

   a connecting element for insertion into said 
housing connecting element insertion portion, said 

connecting element including at least two connecting 
recesses for contacting one of the cable conductors at 

one recess and the at least one branch conductor at the 
other of said recesses, and insulation-piercing 

portions adjacent said recesses; 
   wherein when said connecting element is inserted 

in the connecting element inserting portion with the 
cable and at least one branch conductor in said 

housing, one of said two recesses pierces the 
insulation of the cable to engage and electrically 

connect to one cable conductor, and the other of said 
recesses engages and electrically connects to the at 

least one branch conductor, so that an electrical 
connection therebetween is established; and 

   a wedge member adjacent said recess which connects 
to the cable conductor and which includes a point to 

pierce said the cable sheath between the conductors of 
the cable so as to facilitate the insertion of said 

conductive connection portion and maintain said 
conductors of the cable electrically isolated from each 

other. 
The connector according to claim 1 wherein 
said wedge member extends beyond said insulation-piercing 

portions of said connecting element. 
The connector according to claim 1 or 2 
including a second connection element aligned with said 

connecting element and wherein both connecting elements 
are connected to each other by said wedge member.
