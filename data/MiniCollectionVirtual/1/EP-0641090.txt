<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna
switching device or an antenna switching duplexer for
use in a radio communication apparatus such as a digital
portable radio telephone performing radio communication
by selectively connecting an antenna to a transmitter
or a receiver, i.e., using a TDMA (time division
multiple access) system.In the past, a single-pole double throw
switch (hereinafter, referred to as an SPDT switch) has
been used for selectively connecting an antenna to
a transmitter or a receiver in mobile communication
equipment. An exemplary conventional SPDT switch will
be described with reference to Figure 7.Figure 7 shows a circuit configuration of a
conventional SPDT switch. The SPDT switch includes
a first signal terminal 601, a second signal
terminal 602, a third signal terminal 603, a control
terminal 604, PIN diodes 605 and 606, a strip line 607
having a 1/4 wavelength of a signal frequency, a resistor
608, an inductor 609, and capacitors 610, 611, 612,
and 613. The resistor 608, the inductor 609, and the
capacitor 611 constitute a control circuit. One end of
the capacitor 611 is connected to one end of the inductor
609, and the other end of the capacitor 611 is
grounded. The capacitors 610, 612, and 613 function as
direct-current blocking capacitors. This conventional SPOT switch is used as a
transmit-receive switch. The operation of the SPDT
switch as a transmit-receive switch will be described.
It is noted that in this case, the first, second, and
third signal terminals 601, 602, and 603 work as a
transmitting terminal, an antenna terminal, and a
receiving terminal, respectively.When a signal is transmitted from the antenna
terminal, a positive voltage is applied to the control
terminal 604. A control current flows through the
control terminal 604, the resistor 608, the inductor
609, the PIN diode 605, the strip line 607, and the
PIN diode 606 in this order. Associated with the flow
of the control current, the impedance between an anode
and a cathode of the PIN diodes 605 and 606 becomes
low. The low impedance state between the anode and the
cathode of the PIN diode 606 renders an electrical
potential at one end of the strip line 607 connected to
the anode of the PIN diode 606 at almost a ground
level. This causes the impedance at the other end of
the strip line 607 with respect to the antenna terminal
602 to be remarkably increased. As a result, a
transmitting signal input from the transmitting terminal
601 is output from the antenna terminal 602 but is
not output from the
