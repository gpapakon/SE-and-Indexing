<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
enzymatic hydrolysis method for the preparation of
C-10 hydroxyl-bearing taxanes, and an enzymatic
esterification method for the preparation of C-10
acyloxy-bearing taxanes, which compounds may be
used, for example, as intermediates in the
preparation of pharmacologically active taxanes
such as taxol and taxol analogues.The present invention also relates to an
enzymatic hydrolysis method for the preparation of
C-13 hydroxyl-bearing taxanes useful as intermediates
in the preparation of C-13 acyloxy-bearing
taxanes, also particularly useful in the
preparation of taxol and taxol analogues.Taxanes are diterpene compounds which find
utility in the pharmaceutical field. For example,
taxol, a taxane having the structure: 

where Ph is phenyl, Ac is acetyl and Bz is benzoyl,
has been found to be an effective anticancer agent.Naturally occurring taxanes such as taxol
may be found in plant materials, and have been
isolated therefrom. Such taxanes may, however, be
present in plant materials in relatively small
amounts so that, in the case of taxol, for example,
large numbers of the slow-growing yew trees forming
a source for the compound may be required. The art
has thus continued to search for synthetic,
including semi-synthetic routes for the preparation
of naturally occurring taxanes such as taxol, as
well as for the preparation of analogues thereof.Due to the complexity of the taxane ring
structure, a taxane containing desired substituents
on the ring system may more readily be prepared by
the use of a starting material already having the
basic taxane ring structure. Thus, for example, a
compound having the taxane ring structure and
containing a hydroxyl group at C-13, and
particularly also containing a desired substituent
at C-10, may be coupled with an intermediate
compound to form a taxane having a desired
sidechain at C-13, such as a pharmacologically 
active taxane having an acyloxy sidechain at C-13
exemplified by taxol or analogues thereof.The present invention provides methods for
obtaining taxanes with desired substituents at
C-10. In particular, the present invention
provides methods for the preparation of C-10
hydroxyl-bearing, and C-10 acyloxy-bearing taxane
compounds, which compounds find utility as starting
materials in the preparation of taxanes such as
taxol and analogues thereof.In one embodiment, the present invention
provides a method for the preparation of at least
one taxane containing a hydroxyl group directly
bonded at C-10, comprising the steps of
