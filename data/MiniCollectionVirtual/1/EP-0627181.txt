A link (12) for a fine jewelry chain (10) which 
includes a base (23) defining an outward-facing surface (29), and 

a raised portion (24) formed integrally with and extending 
longitudinally along the outward-facing surface (29) of the base 

(23), wherein the raised portion (24) has at least one diamond-cut 
high luster surface (36) formed thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fine jewelry diamond 
cut chains and to methods of manufacture thereof. Fine jewelry chains, in general, and fine jewelry rope 
chains, in particular, are well known. In US Patents Nos. 
4,934,135 and 4,996,835, there are disclosed rope chains and 
methods for preparing such rope chains having reduced weight and 
labor costs compared with conventional rope chains of the same 
chain diameter. In the field of rope chains there are known both solid 
rope chains and hollow rope chains. A solid rope chain is a rope 
chain whose links are made from solid portions of metal, while a 
hollow rope chain is a rope chain whose links are hollow. While 
the general appearance of a rope chain is not affected by the 
links thereof being either solid or hollow, the amount of 
precious metal used in a solid rope chain of a given size is 
significantly greater than the amount of precious metal used in a 
hollow rope chain of the same size. Accordingly, a hollow rope 
chain of a given size is significantly cheaper than a solid rope 
chain of the same size. A particularly popular type of rope chain is a diamond 
cut rope chain. Such a chain comprises flat cuts or facets on 
the outer perimeter of at least some of the chain links to  
 
provide a high luster finish so as to make the chain sparkle. 
Diamond cut facets are known to be formed on solid rope chains by 
cutting or shaving a facet from a curved section of the links. Solid diamond cut rope chains have facets generally cut 
about one third or more into the thickness of the chain link in 
order to obtain a reasonable size shiny surface. In this case, 
the amount of precious metal sheared away can be as much as 10% 
of the weight of the chain and although the metal shearings are 
collected and recycled, a significant amount of precious metal is 
nevertheless lost in the process. Although it is known to form diamond cut facets on 
hollow rope chains, this presents certain problems due to the 
relative thinness of the outer wall of the hollow links used. In 
some cases the outer wall may be as thin as 0.05 mm. 
Accordingly, the forming of a facet in the way in which facets 
are formed on a solid rope chain would at least cause severe 
weakening of the outer wall of the link and would probably make a 
hole therein. In US Patent No. 5,125,225 to Strobel, there is 
described the making of hollow rope chains. The method involves 
wrapping a hollow rope chain about a lathe drum, freezing the 
drum, applying water to the chain to freeze it in
