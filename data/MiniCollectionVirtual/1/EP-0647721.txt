<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for
treating metal ions to recover metals which are valuable
from the viewpoint of both resources and economy, from
various aqueous solutions containing metal ions, such as
a metal ion-containing waste water discharged from a
process for producing a compound containing e.g. copper
or mercury by using a copper or mercury compound, a metal
ion-containing waste water discharged at the time of
producing electronic parts, a metal ion-containing waste
water discharged from a process of using an industrial
catalyst or from treatment of a used catalyst, and a
waste fixing solution containing a metal complex salt
such as a silver complex salt discharged from photograph
industry, to a process for producing such a metal ion-treating
agent, and to a method for treating metal ions
in aqueous solution such as various waste waters. More 
particularly, it relates to a treating agent useful for
recovering heavy metal ions such as copper or mercury
ions and/or so-called noble metal ions such as ions of
gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium or ruthenium,
contained in an aqueous solution, to a process for
producing such a treating agent and to a method for such
treatment.Further, the present invention relates to a
technology wherein a selective reduction reaction is
conducted by means of a metal ion-treating agent of a
redox reagent of hydroquinone type comprising a solid
porous carrier and anthraquinone or its derivative
supported on the carrier, so that metal ions contained in
a waste water are selectively converted to monovalent
metal ions or zero valent metals in the flowing aqueous
solution, and if necessary, monovalent metal ions
separated, accumulated and captured on the solid porous
carrier are eluted out of the system by supplying an
eluent solution and recovered as the monovalent metal
ions, whereby a waste water which is likely to adversely
affect underwater inhabitants, can be made harmless, and
the metal ion-treating agent having the monovalent metal
ions eluted or oxidized to lose the reducing ability, can
be reduced for restoration and reuse.In Japan, most metals are imported in recent years.
Large amounts of noble metals are used for electric parts
and for photosensitive materials to be used in photograph 
industry and for industrial catalysts such as industrial
oxidation catalysts and reduction catalysts to be used
for automobiles or oxidation treatment in industrial
waste gases. Accordingly, waste waters containing heavy
metal ions or noble metal ions are
