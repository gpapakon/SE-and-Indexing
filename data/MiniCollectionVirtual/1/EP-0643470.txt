<ABSTRACT>
A linear motor includes a stator 1 having an 
even number N of salient poles 11, 12, ... disposed at 

an equal angle pitch and a mover 3 disposed movably in a 
shaft direction. The salient poles are constituted by 

pairs of salient poles adjacent to each other and 
including m sets of salient pole groups composed of 

(N/2m) sets of salient pole pairs disposed at an angle 
of (720m/N) degrees. Windings W1, W2, ... wound on 


(N/m)-1 
 
 or 


(N/m)-2 
 
 salient poles belonging to each of 

the salient pole groups are connected to have opposite 
polarities between the pair of salient poles and are 

connected to have the same polarity between the salient 
poles which do not constitute the pair of salient poles 

and are disposed to interpose the salient pole of the 
other phase therebetween to constitute phase windings 

for m phases. Remaining salient poles of the salient 
pole group are caused to detect a position and a 

movement direction of the mover 3 as sensor poles S

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a linear 
motor, and more particularly to a linear motor operated 
as a two-phase and a multi-phase linear pulse motor or a 
brushless DC linear motor. Fig. 10 is a longitudinal sectional view 
illustrating a permanent magnet type cylindrical linear 
motor pertinent to the present invention. In Fig. 10, a stator core 101 of a stator 100 
of the permanent magnet type cylindrical linear motor 
includes a ring-like yoke portion having a small inner 
diameter and forming ring-like stator tooth tops 102a 
and a ring-like yoke portion having a large inner 
diameter and forming ring-like stator tooth bottoms 
102b, both the yoke portions being laminated alternately 
in the shaft direction. Thus, stator teeth 102 composed 
of a number of ring-like tooth tops 102a and ring-like 
tooth bottoms (grooves) 102b are formed in the inner 
peripheral surface of the stator core 101 at equal 
pitches in the shaft direction. Ring-like windings 103, 104, ... 110 are 
disposed in the ring-like tooth bottoms (grooves) 102b, 
respectively. The ring-like windings 103, 104, ... 110 
are configured to have two phases in total as shown in 
Fig. 11 so that the ring-like windings 103, 105, 107 and 
109 are connected so that the polarities thereof are 
reversed alternately to form one phase (A phase) and the 
ring-like windings 104, 106, 108 and 110 are connected 
so that the polarities thereof are reversed alternately 
to form the other phase (B phase). Since the stator 100  
 
is configured as above, the pole pitch of the stator 100 
is four times the tooth pitch of the stator teeth 102. Further, A mover core 301 of a mover 300 is 
cylindrical and permanent magnet poles 302 magnetized to 
have the polarities different radially and alternately 
are disposed on the outer periphery of the mover core at 
a pitch equal to twice the tooth pitch of the stator 
teeth 102. Consequently, the pole pitch of the mover 
300 is four times the pitch of the stator teeth and is 
coincident with the pole pitch of the stator 100. The two-phase windings disposed in the stator 
core 101 are shifted from each other by the tooth pitch 
of the stator teeth, that is, a quarter of the pole 
pitch of the stator in the shaft direction, and the 
linear motor constitutes a two-phase permanent magnet 
type cylindrical linear pulse motor having a basic 
amount of movement for each step which is equal to a 
quarter of the pole pitch, that is, the pitch of the 
stator teeth. In the permanent magnet type cylindrical 
linear pulse
