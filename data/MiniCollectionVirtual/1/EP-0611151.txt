<ABSTRACT>
An indicator comprises a shutter 20 having 
apertures 32 arranged to denote settings of the control 

passing over a light diffuser 34. The shutter 20 is 
coupled to an actuator 24 of the control by a lost 

motion mechanism comprising springs 56 arranged in 
peripheral grooves 52 of the actuator between the ends 

of the grooves and side walls of lugs 54 of the shutter 
20. The shutter is held in a desired setting position 

by a detent spring 48, but as the actuator 24 is 
rotated, springs 56a, 56b are loaded until they overcome 

the detent force, so as to flick the shutter to the next 
setting position under spring force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to indicators for 
apparatus, particularly electrical apparatus, having 
rotary control members and in particular, but not 
exclusively, to indicators showing a power level set by 
a rotary control for electrical heating appliances such 
as cooker hot plates, hobs, grills and ovens. In an attempt to improve the appearance of electric 
cookers and hobs, manufacturers have sought to devise 
new ways in which to indicate to a user the power 
setting of a heating element, for example. In 
particular, it has been proposed to include a display 
means providing a variable illuminated region the extent 
and/or pattern of which is indicative of the power 
setting. This form of display means may be provided 
instead of or in addition to a printed numerical scale 
which is traditionally associated with the or each 
control knob of the device. Recent proposals have 
included arrays of light emitting diodes or neon bulbs, 
arranged in a linear manner. These are controlled 
electronically in response to turning of a control knob 
of the element in question to illuminate more of the 
neons or l.e.d.'s as the power setting is increased. 
Other proposals have included arrays of neon bulbs 
arranged in a 'bar-eight' configuration in which by 
illuminating selected combinations of the bulbs, the 
numerals 0 to 9 may be displayed. Again, this type of 
array is controlled electronically in response to 
turning of the control knob. These arrangements are, however, expensive. The 
present invention seeks to provide an alternative 
mechanical system which avoids the need for large 
numbers of neons or l.e.d.'s and a multiple electrical 
switch means or electronic encoders and decoders for 
electronic controls.  
 A display for a rotary control according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-3,916,317. 
The present invention is distinguished over this disclosure by the features of 
the characterising part of claim 1. A modern illuminated type of display may therefore 
be provided without the need to provide a large number 
of individual electronically controlled indicator bulbs. In this regard the term 'level' will be understood 
to mean the magnitude of a parameter set by the control. 
For example, in the context of electrical cooking 
apparatus the level may be the power supplied to a 
heating element. The display means may be illuminated, for example 
from the front, but preferably it is illuminated from 
behind and comprises light transmission means whereby 
the light from a light

<CLAIMS>
A display for a rotary control (2;28) comprising a 
rotary actuating member (24) settable in a number of 

discrete positions representing different settings of 
the control (2;28), and a display modification member 

(8;20) coupled to said actuating member (24) for 
changing said display as said actuating member (24) is 

rotated, said modification member (8;20) being 
selectively retainable in a number of discrete positions 

by detent means (46,48), and coupled to said actuating 
member (24) via a lost motion mechanism (52,54) 

characterised in that said lost motion mechanism 
comprises spring means (56) which is pre-loaded by an 

initial rotary movement of said actuating member (24), 
and which moves said modification member (8;20) to an 

adjacent setting when the pre-loading force exceeds the 
retaining force of the detent means (46,48) such that 

said display is changed in an apparently instantaneous 
manner. 
A display as claimed in claim 1 wherein said spring 
means comprises springs (56) which may be loaded by 

motion of said actuating member (24) in either rotary 
direction. 
A display as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein said 
spring means (56) is arranged symmetrically about the 

axis of rotation (A) of said control (2;28). 
A display as claimed in any preceding claim, 
further comprising an illuminated scale (6), wherein a 

varying portion of the scale (6) is exposed or 
illuminated as the actuating member (24) is rotated, to 

represent the setting of the control (2;28).  
 
A display as claimed in claim 4 wherein said scale 
(6) is linear. 
A display as claimed in claim 5 wherein said 
modification member comprises shutter means (8;20) and 

said scale (6) comprises a series of discrete, aligned 
areas (13), in the form of apertures, transparent or 

translucent regions, through which light may be 
transmitted and which are selectively covered or 

uncovered by the shutter means (8;20). 
A display as claimed in claim 6 wherein said 
shutter means (8;20) comprises a rotary mask (8) having 

a cam profile (11), the profile (11) comprising discrete 
sections (12) joined by steps. 
A display as claimed in claim 7 wherein said 
discrete sections (12) are formed as arcs of 

successively increasing radii, and said steps (15) 
extend generally radially. 
A display as claimed in claim 6 wherein said 
shutter means (20) comprises a mask having symbols (32) 

passing in front of said illumination and representing 
settings of the control (28). 
A display as claimed in claim 9 wherein said 
symbols are digits formed by apertures (32) in said mask 

(20). 
Cooking appliance comprising a display as claimed 
in any preceding claim. 
An appliance as claimed in claim 11, wherein the 
display is arranged in or behind a fascia panel (1;22) 

of the appliance, and a rotary control (2;28) for said 
appliance is arranged behind said fascia panel (1;22),  

 
the actuating member (3;26) of the control of the 

appliance extending through said panel for manipulation 
by a user, and being coupled to the actuating member 

(24) of said display. 
An appliance as claimed in claim 12 wherein the 
appliance is an electric cooker and the control an 

energy regulator (2;28) for supplying electrical energy 
to an element of the cooker.
