<ABSTRACT>
In the process for the selective noncatalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, a liquid nitrogen-containing reducing agent is injected into the hot flue gas stream with the aid of two-component nozzle lances. The injection is performed in a pulsed mode at a frequency of 5 s
<

 to 70 s
<

, preferably 10 s
<

 to 20 s

. This mode of operation causes a spray cone having relatively coarse droplets of large range and a spray cone having relatively fine droplets of small range to be generated alternately at each two-component nozzle. The reducing agent used is ammonia dissolved in water (ammonia water) at flue gas temperatures of 1060@C to 1170@C. The apparatus for carrying out this process comprises a flue gas duct 3 in which are installed a plurality of two-component nozzle lances 4 operated by a pressure medium. The liquid and gas feed of a two-component nozzle lance 4 are each connected to a first resonance chamber 15 arranged in the two-component nozzle, downstream of which first resonance chamber is connected at least one further resonance chamber 18 separated from the first resonance chamber 15 by an orifice plate 17. The last resonance chamber 18, seen in the direction of flow, is then directly connected to the outlet orifice 19 of the two-component nozzle.

Process for the selective non-catalytic reduction of 
nitrogen oxides in hot flue gases, in which a liquid 

reducing agent which contains nitrogen is injected into the 
flue gas stream at a temperature of from 800 to 1300°C with 

the aid of two-fluid nozzle lances (4), characterised in 
that the two-fluid nozzles are operated in pulsating manner 

at a frequency of from 5 to 70 s
-1
, preferably from 10 to 20 
s
-1
, wherein there is generated at each two-fluid nozzle 
alternately an atomising cone (6) having relatively coarse 

droplets of a long range and an atomising cone having 
relatively fine droplets of a short range. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
ammonia dissolved in water (that is to say, ammoniacal 

liquor) is used as the liquid reducing agent, preferably at 
flue gas temperatures of from 1060 to 1140°C. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 2, characterised in 
that the throughput of compressed air and liquid is 

adjusted such that the mass flux ratio of the air stream to 
the liquid stream, averaged out over time, is within the 

range 0.01 to 0.2 at each two-fluid nozzle, while the 
transient value of the mass flux ratio fluctuates between 

two extreme values at the same frequency of pulsation. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 

that the pulsating operation takes place as a result of 
impinging compressed air or liquid in periodic manner on 

the two-fluid nozzle. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the pulsating operation is generated within the two-fluid 

nozzle itself with compressed air and liquid 
impinging in a manner which is constant as to time.  

 
Device for carrying out the process according to Claim 
5, comprising a flue gas duct (3) in which there is 

installed a plurality of two-fluid nozzle lances (4) 
operated with a compressed medium and having liquid and 

compressed gas supplies, characterised in that the liquid 
supply and compressed gas supply are connected to a first 

resonance chamber (15) which is disposed in the two-fluid 
nozzle and downstream whereof there is installed a further 

resonance chamber (18) which is separated from the first 
resonance chamber (15) by an orifice (17), and that the 

final resonance chamber (18), viewed in the direction of 
flow, is connected directly to the outlet opening (19) of 

the two-fluid nozzle. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
feed lines for the compressed medium and the fluid, which 

open into the first resonance chamber (15), are embodied 
such that the two phases are conveyed into the first 

resonance chamber (15) largely without intermixing. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
feed line for the liquid comprises an inner pipe (10) which 

is disposed in coaxial manner, and is centred with the aid 
of segmental rods (12), within an enclosing pipe (9), and 

the supply for the compressed medium comprises the annular 
gap (13) remaining between the enclosing pipe (9) and the 

inner pipe (10), and that the inner pipe (10) has a 
distributor (11) which is sealed on the face, drilled 

outlet holes (14) which are oriented perpendicularly to the 
nozzle axis and are distributed in uniform manner over the 

periphery and which, viewed in the direction of flow, are 
disposed in the dead space behind segmental rods (12) which 

partially close the annular gap cross-section.  
 
Device according to Claims 5 to 8, characterised in 
that the volume of the first resonance chamber (15) is 

adjustable. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
inner pipe (10) having the distributor (11) is disposed 

such as to be axially displaceable within the enclosing 
pipe (9), such that the length (a) of the first resonance 

chamber (15) is adjustable. 
Device according to Claims 5 to 10, characterised in 
that the nozzle is embodied as a flat jet nozzle.
