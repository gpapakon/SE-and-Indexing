<ABSTRACT>
A tube restoring apparatus includes a tube insertion 
passage (30) through which a connected flexible tube (2) having a 

deformed cross-sectional portion at a joint portion thereof 
can be passed, at least a pair of press members (3a,b) defining at 

least a part of the tube insertion passage and formed with 
press surfaces for pinching the deformed cross-sectional 

portion of the flexible tube therebetween, and driving 
mechanism (35a,b) for moving the press surfaces (31a,b) at least in 

opposite 
directions relative to each other under the condition that 

the deformed cross-sectional portion is pressed between the 
press surfaces. In the apparatus, the deformed cross-sectional 

portion of which inner surface is fused or stuck 
by a tube connecting device is disposed between the press 

surfaces of the press members, and then the press members 
are moved by the driving mechanism so as to press or roll 

back and forth the deformed portion of the tube to tear off 
or separate the fused or stuck portion between the press 

surfaces, thereby restoring the deformed portion to ensure 
fluid communication within the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates 
to a tube restoring 
apparatus and a tube restoring method of automatically 
restoring a deformed joint portion which is 
formed between flexible tubes connected by fusion and 
of which the inner surface is fused or stuck 
by fusion so as to ensure internal fluid communication of the 
connected tubes. Conventionally, as tubes for connecting bags of a 
liquid transfusing system or a blood transfusing system, 
polyvinyl chloride tubes are mainly used. Since the 
polyvinyl chloride tube is formed of a thermoplastic resin, 
there has been developed sterile tube connecting device 
(SCD) and connecting method by the device which can connect 
cut-off tubes under the sterilized condition by utilization 
of the thermoplastic characteristics of the tubes (which are 
disclosed in for example USP 4,369,779). With this result, 
it has become possible to cut off and further connect tubes 
used in a system in which a plurality of bags are connected 
through the tubes, under the sterilized condition. The above-mentioned sterile tube connecting device 
is composed of a cutting blade heated to such a temperature 
that the tube material can be melted, and two holding 
members for holding two tubes to be connected. For 
connection of the tubes, two tubes which are held 
horizontally and parallel with each other by the two holding 
members are cut off simultaneously with the heated blade. 
Further, under the condition that the cut-off surfaces of 
the tubes are in contact with the heated blade, the holding  
 
members are moved so that the cut-off surfaces of the two 
tubes can be brought into contact with each other, and then 
the blade is pulled out. However, when the blade is pulled 
out from between the two cut-off tubes, the cross-sectional 
shape of the connected tube is usually deformed, so that the 
tube (polyvinyl chloride) is hardened in the state where the 
cross-sectional shape of the tube is crushed. In other 
words, the cross-sectional shape of the tube is usually 
crushed at the respective joint portion, since the inner 
surface of the tube at the joint portion is fused or stuck 
by fusion, so that there is the possibility that the tube is 
closed at the joint portion. When the tube is crushed at the joint portion 
thereof after the tubes have been connected to each other, 
liquid or blood cannot flow therethrough. Therefore, in 
such a case, it becomes necessary to restore the shape of 
the deformed joint portion by applying external force to the 
stuck portion (fused portion)
