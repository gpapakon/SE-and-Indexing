<ABSTRACT>
The contact breaker (10) breaks a pair of electrical contacts comprising a fixed contact (11) and a movable contact (12). A pretensioned switch lever (17) for the movable contact can be moved into a ready position. To move the switching lever from the ready position in which it is maintained by a holding device (19), a pivotal dislocation is provided to apply an increased breaking force to the moveable contact. The slidable pivot (21) applies an initially high force, which decreases as the switching lever moves the contacts open. The switching lever comprises a first shank (18) which contacts the lever holding device (19), and a second shank (20) which contacts the moveable contact (12).

Arrangement (10) for breaking open a pair of electrical 
contacts tending to get stuck, which consists of a stationary 

contact (11) and a contact (12) movable away from 
the stationary one, particularly in a protective switching 

device, comprising a switching lever (17) biased in 
the contact break-open direction and pivotable from a 

stand-by position about a sliding pivot (21) for acting 
upon said movable contact (12), and a means (19) serving 

to hold said switching lever (17) in the stand-by position, 
with the direction of displacement of said sliding 

pivot (17) being oriented in a way that said switching 
lever (17) is pivotable, in a first phase of movement, at 

a high lever ratio, from the stand-by position about an 
abutment point (24) so as to achieve a great break-open 

force. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
said switching lever (17) comprises a first leg (18) for 

engagement of said holding means (19) and a second leg 
(20) for engagement on said movable contact (12), with 

said switching lever (17) being supported between its two 
legs for sliding pivoting movement (21) and on said second 

leg (20) for abutting pivoting motion (24). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the direction of displacement of said sliding  

 
pivot (21) is so oriented that in a second phase of movement 

said switching lever (17) is additionally or separately 
displaceable and, in a third phase of movement, 

pivotable about said sliding pivot (21) with a reduced 
continuing breaking-open force due to a comparatively 

lower lever ratio. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the positions of said abutment point (24) and said 

sliding pivot (21) are so selected that the line of action 
of the force directed toward said mobile contact 

(12) will coincide with the direction of movement of the 
contact when the latter opens, and subsequently diverges, 

while it reduces the force, under the pivoting motion of 
said switching lever (17). 
Arrangement according to any of the Claims 2 to 4, characterized 
in that said sliding pivot (21) is configured 

to include a stationary pivot (22) guided in an oblong 
hole (23). 
Arrangement according to any of the Claims 2 to 5, characterized 
in that said switching lever (17) includes 

bearing faces (25, 26) in mutual angular relationship on 
either side of said abut
ment point (24). 
Arrangement according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that a switching spring (30) is provided 

for biasing said switching lever (17), which spring is 
articulated on said first leg (18).  

 
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the line of action of the force of said switching 

spring is so selected that the length (a, a') of the 
resulting lever arm for the pivoting movement of said 

switching lever (17) in the third phase of movement is 
reduced relative to the corresponding length in the 

first phase of movement. 
Arrangement according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that said holding means (19) is designed 

to include a releasable latch lock (28, 29).
