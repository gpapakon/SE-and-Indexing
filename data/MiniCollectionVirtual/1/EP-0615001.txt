<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of monitoring electroless plating solutions. The 
solutions are used to plate a light-transmitting medium (11). Measurements are 

made to determine the time it takes for light transmission through the medium to be 
reduced to a certain level (t
i
, t
c
, t
1/2
). This measurement can be used to determine 
whether articles will be sufficiently plated by the solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fabrication of plated articles and, in 
particular, to a method of monitoring the solutions used to plate such articles. In the fabrication of printed circuit boards, complete coverage of certain 
areas by an electroless copper plating operation is an essential step. Unfortunately, 
slight changes in the composition of the solutions required for electroless plating can 
have a significant effect on the coverage. Consequently, the solutions should be 
constantly monitored. Present wet chemical analysis and backlight measurements have 
generally proven insufficient in either predicting problems or in identifying the cause 
of problems once they manifest themselves. This has resulted in enormous waste in 
terms of time and material until the problem is corrected. For example, in a typical 
printed circuit board fabrication process, it may take several hours for a particular 
board to traverse the various solutions used for electroless plating. Consequently, 
the effect of any adjustments in the solutions on the coverage of the board will not 
show up for a long time. According to the present invention, there is provided a method as 
defined in claim 1. In accordance with one aspect, the invention is a method of plating an 
article by applying thereto a plurality of solutions. The method includes the step of 
monitoring the solutions by applying the solutions to a specimen which permits light 
to be transmitted therethrough. As the specimen is plated, the level of light 
transmission therethrough is measured to determine a time in which the level is 
reduced to a predetermined value. In the drawing: 
FIG. 1 is schematic illustration of apparatus which can be utilized to 
practice an embodiment of the invention; FIG. 2 is a graph of light transmittance as a function of time illustrating 
a step in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; FIG. 3 is a graph of a certain time measurement as a function of 
concentration in one solution in accordance with the same embodiment;  
 FIG. 4 is a graph of a certain time measurement as a function of 
concentration in another solution in accordance with the same embodiment;

accordance with a further embodiment of the invention; FIG. 6 is a graph of a certain time measurement as a function of

<CLAIMS>
A method of plating an article by applying thereto a plurality of 
solutions, including the steps of monitoring the effectiveness of the solutions in 

plating the article CHARACTERIZED by the steps of: 

applying the solutions to a specimen (11) which permits light to be 
transmitted therethrough; and 
while the specimen is being plated, measuring the level of light 
transmission therethrough and determining a time (t
i
, t
c
, t
1/2
) in which light 
transmission decreases to a predetermined value. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the said time is compared 
with a threshold time to indicate if the article will be sufficiently plated by the 

solutions. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the decrease in light 
transmission as a function of time exhibits an essentially linear portion, and the said 

time (t
c
) is determined by extrapolating the linear portion to an axis at the point of 
no light transmission on the curve. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the said time is the time (t
i
) 
when the light transmission through the specimen begins to decrease a significant 

amount. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the said time is the time 
(t
1/2
) when light transmission decreases to a predetermined percentage of its initial 
value. 
The method according to claim 5 wherein said time is the time the 
light transmission decreases to one-half its initial value. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the article is a printed 
circuit board with holes therethrough, and the specimen is a transparent tube which 

simulates plating in the holes. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the article is a printed 
circuit board, and the specimen is the same material as the printed circuit board.  

 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the solutions comprise a 
conditioner, an activator, an accelerator and an electroless plating solution. 
The method according to claim 9 wherein the plating solution 
comprises a metallic plating solution. 
The method according to claim 10 wherein the plating solution 
comprises copper. 
The method according to claim 1 further comprising the step of 
correlating the said time with the activity of a component of the solutions.
