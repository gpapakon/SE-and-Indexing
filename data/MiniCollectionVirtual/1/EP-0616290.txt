<ABSTRACT>
A medical information processing system for supporting diagnosis, 
which allows an original image (eg. X-ray image) to be displayed 

together with a reduced image for indicating positions of 
abonormalities. The system includes a detecting unit for detecting 

abnormalities in the image, a unit for marking the abnormalities on the 
reduced image and a display unit for displaying the original and reduced 

images so that they do not interfere with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical information
processing system for comparing a plurality of diagnositic
information including doctors' findings and results of
computerized analysis of images and other examination data
and thus supporting doctors in evaluating examination more
efficiently.Diagnostic Imaging International, Vol.8 No.5, 1992, USA,
pages 29 to 37, discloses a medical information processing system
in accordance with the preamble of
claim 1.Generally, an image diagnosis in medical institutes
will be carried out according to the following
procedures:
(1) An examination requesting department (for
example, the Department of Internal Medicine) requests
the Department of Radiology to carry out an image
examination for a patient (for example, X-rays, CT, MRI
or the like). This request is performed by issuing an
examination request sheet in which the following items
are written:
The items of the examination request sheet contain:
a patient ID number, a patient name, a date of birth, a
sex, a name of examination requesting department, a name
of examination requesting doctor, an examination modality
(an X-ray machine, an X-ray computed tomography machine,
a magnetic resonance imaging machine etc.), a region to
be examined, a procedure of examination, a purpose of
examination, clinical information and the like;(2) An examination enginner of the Department of Radiology 
makes an examination (an image acquisition) of a patient
according to contents of the examination request sheet
to develop it on a film;(3) An interpreting doctor interprets the developed
films. At this time, it is often material to refer to the
past examination results (the past image) of the patient
to obtain higher interpreting quality. When the
interpreting doctor has completed the image, he/she will
prepare an interpretation report. The following items will
be described in this interpretation report:
These items include a finding from interpretation, a
conclusion, a name of the interpreting doctor, a date of
the interpretation, and the like; and(4) This interpretation report is returned to the
examination requesting doctor to finish image diagnostic
operations.By the way, as a digital image has a characteristic
that it simplifies a computerized image processing, this
feature facilitates attempts of analyzing digital images
using a computer to detect patient abnormalities. This
has born fruits. The technology is called a Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD), which is expected to further
improve accuracy in the image diagnosis and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis, the system comprising:


detecting means (4e) for detecting location of abnormality
from a first medical image in accordance with a predetermined

algorithm;
image forming means (4p, 4r) for forming a second medical
image narrower in size than the first medical image;

   
characterized by

   overlay data making means (4n, 41) for making a marker
indicating the location of the abnormality on the second medical

image and overlay display information;

   overlaying means (4q, 44) for overlaying the marker and
the overlay display information upon the second image;

   display means (4i) for displaying the first medical image
and the second medical image simultaneously,

   wherein the image forming means
comprises minifying means (4p) for minifying the first medical

image to treat the minified first medical image as the second
medical image.
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 1, wherein the minifying means (4p)

divides the first medical image into plural portions and
averages plural pixel values included in each portion to obtain

one pixel value for each portion, thereby minifying the first
medical image.
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 1, wherein the image forming means

comprises minifying means (4p) for minifying a predetermined
schematic image of an object imaged in the first image to treat

the minified schematic image as the second medical image. 
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 3, wherein the minifying means (4p)

divides the predetermined schematic image into plural portions
and averages plural pixel values included in each portion to

obtain one pixel value for each portion, thereby minifying the
predetermined schematic image.
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 1, wherein the overlaying means

(44) converts coordinates of the location of the abnormality
on the first medical image into coordinates thereof on the

second medical image, thereby overlaying the marker upon the
second medical image.
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 1, wherein the overlaying means

(44) converts pixel values of a desired portion of the second
medical image corresponding to the shape of characters of the

overlay display information into a desired value, thereby
overlaying the overlay display information upon the second

medical image.
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 1, wherein the overlaying means

(4q) overlays the second medical image upon the first medical
image.
A medical information processing system for supporting
diagnosis according to claim 1, wherein the overlay display

information comprises the type of abnormality and the degree
of abnormality.
