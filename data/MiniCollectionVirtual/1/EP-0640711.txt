<ABSTRACT>
A degumming device in which a silk fabric can be suspended easily and can 
be degummed uniformly. Radial arms (26) are provided in a cylindrical 

degumming kier (11). A silk fabric is suspended spirally from the arms by 
attaching its top edge to hooks provided on the arms. In this state, a gap 

is present between the adjacent layers of the spirally suspended silk fabric. 
Since degumming solution can smoothly flow through the gap, the silk fabric 

can be degummed uniformly. While degumming, the arms are gradually swung 
upwards so that the distances between the adjacent arms narrow gradually. 

With this arrangement, the top edge of the silk fabric is allowed to shrink 
at the same rate as its bottom edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a device for degumming 
a silk fabric. In order to give a silk fabric a gracious luster and a soft 
touch inherent to silk, and also for good dying and printing, 
its sericin content has to be removed by degumming. A method 
and device for degumming a fabric in a degumming kier as 
described in the first part of claims 1 and 3 is known from 
US-A-3753358 in which the silk fabric is hung in a spiral 
pattern as viewed from top so that its width extends 
vertically. For that purpose use is made of a device 
comprising a degumming kier, a supporting rod arranged 
vertically along the central axis of said degumming kier and 
a plurality of arms extending radially from said supporting 
rod at a predetermined height, each of said arms being 
provided with hooks arranged in a longitudinal direction. GB-A-1081479 
and FR-A-2228020 disclose similar fabric 
treatments. Fig. 10 illustrates another conventional method of degumming 
silk in which silk fabrics a folded in a 
longitudinal direction are hung in a rectangular degumming 
kier 1. A degumming solution b is fed into the degumming kier 
1 from its top, discharged from its bottom and resupplied 
into the kier from its top, so that the solution is 
circulated through the degumming kier 1. The degumming solution b flows downwards in the degumming 
kier, whereas the silk fabrics a are folded in a longitudinal 
direction. Thus, the degumming solution does not flow 
uniformly into the inner layers of the folded silk fabrics, 
so that they cannot be degummed uniformly over the 
entire length thereof. An object of the present invention is to provide a degumming 
method and device which permits a uniform circulation of the 
degumming solution throughout the degumming kier, while 
facilitating the work for fixing the fabric in the kier.  
 Another object is to provide a degumming method and 
device which improves the workability. The structure employed in this invention to solve 
these problems is disclosed in claim 3. The method related thereto is disclosed in claim 1. The top edge of the silk fabric are fixed at a 
plurality of points arranged in a spiral pattern as viewed 
from top so as to rise gradually outwardly from the center 
of the spiral pattern. While degumming the silk fabric hung in the degumming 
kier, the spiral shape of the silk fabric should be such 
that the inclination of the plane extending from the center 
of spiral pattern to its outer periphery increases 
gradually. The device for degumming a silk fabric

claim 1,
 
   
characterized
 in, that
 
   the angle formed by the top edge of said silk fabric 

(
a
