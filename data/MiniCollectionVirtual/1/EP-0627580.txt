means (3) for regulating the oil pressure to be fed to the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
controlling the shift of an automatic transmission
and, more particularly, to a shift control system for
controlling an oil pressure to be fed to frictional
engagement means directly by a pressure regulator
valve at a shifting time.As is well known in the art, an automatic transmission
for vehicles is constructed to change power
transmission paths in a gear train to execute a shift
by applying/releasing frictional engagement means including
clutches and brakes. Since the shifting operation
is followed by rotational fluctuations of the
rotary elements including the engine, the output shaft
torque is abruptly changed to cause a shifting shock
thereby to deteriorate the riding comfortableness, if
the frictional engagement means is abruptly applied or
released. In the case of the so-called "clutch-to-clutch
shift", in which a predetermined frictional 
engagement means is released whereas another is applied,
the engine will be either blown up or tied up
to lower the output shaft torque and the durability of
the frictional engagement means if the applying or
releasing timing is improper.In the prior art, the engaging pressure of the
frictional engagement means for absorbing the inertial
energy accompanying the rotational fluctuations of the
rotary elements is gradually augmented according to
the characteristics of an accumulator by attaching
this accumulator to the frictional engagement means.The oil pressure for applying the frictional
engagement means equipped with the accumulator will
change, as illustrated in Fig. 9. For time period
after the feed of oil pressure is started, the piston
of a hydraulic servo mechanism operates and advances
to reduce the pack clearance. For subsequent time
period 2 ○ , the oil pressure rises according to the
characteristics of the accumulator so that the torque
capacity of the frictional engagement means gradually
increases.If such accumulator is used, the frictional engagement
means comes into gradual engagement, as
described above, so that the inertial energy can be
absorbed by the slipping actions of the frictional 
elements to effect a smooth shift. However, the accumulator
having such action is required to have a
considerable capacity of oil. For reducing the size
and weight of the hydraulic control system, it is
desired to control the engaging pressure of the frictional
engagement means directly by a pressure regulator
valve in place of the accumulator. This desirable
control system is schematically shown in Fig. 10.
