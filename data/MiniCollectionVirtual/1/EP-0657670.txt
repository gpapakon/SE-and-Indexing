<ABSTRACT>
A support frame (12) and movable deck (13) on a lay 
vessel (24) support a tower (14) at the desired angle for 

pipe laying. The tower (14) has a travel block (16) that 
is movable between open and closed positions for receiving 

a pipe section and supporting the weight of the pipe or 
pipeline. The travel block (16) can move along the length 

of the tower (14) for raising or lowering the pipe or 
pipeline. A pedestal (18) that is movable between open and 

closed positions for receiving a pipe section and 
supporting the weight of the pipeline is positioned near 

the bottom of the tower (14) and arranged to transfer the 
weight of the pipeline from the travel block (16) to the 

pedestal (18) without the need to open the travel block 
(16). A strongback (20) with adjustable clamps is used to 

grasp a pipe section from a ready rack (64) and transfer 
the pipe section into the tower (14) for addition of the 

pipe section to the pipeline. The strongback (20) is 
guided into and up the tower (14) by rails. A stinger (22) 

extends down from the lower end of the tower (14) and is 
provided with clamps to grip the pipeline during 

operations. The main portion of the stinger (22) may be 
pivoted up adjacent the lay vessel (24) when pipe laying 

operations are not in progress.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is generally related to the laying of
pipeline and particularly to the near vertical laying of
pipeline offshore such as in deep water.The laying of offshore pipelines has been done for
many years utilizing the technique referred to as S-lay.
In the S-lay technique, joints of pipe are added to the
pipeline in a horizontal position on the deck of a lay
barge. The pipeline then curves over the stern of the
barge, angles down toward the seabed, curves back to-horizontal
and lays on the seabed. The profile of the
pipeline from the lay barge to the seabed is in the form of
a long "S", which leads to the name of S-lay.Although S-lay has been the method of choice for
virtually all pipeline installed to date, there are
physical limitations on the use of this technique. Chief
among these is water depth. As the water depth increases,
the ability to move the vessel on anchors becomes more and
more difficult and the horizontal component of the pipe
tension becomes greater and greater. The offshore pipeline
industry has been aware of this problem for years and has
as a solution, accepted the concept of near vertical lay,
called J-lay, as the system of choice for deep water pipe
laying. It should be understood that the definition of
deep water, when referring to the use of J-lay, is a direct
function of pipe diameter. This relationship is a result
of the minimum water depth required for pipe of a certain
diameter to achieve the proper flex during the vertical
laying operation. There is also a maximum practical depth
for specific pipe diameters. As an example, pipe having a
diameter of 168.3 mm (6.625 inches) requires a minimum
water depth, with no water in the pipe, of 37.8 m (124
feet). At the opposite end of the scale, pipe having a
diameter of 1.07 m (42 inches) requires a minimum water 
depth, with no water in the pipe, of 407.5 m (1,337 feet).Considerable work has been done over the years on the
theoretical aspects of the J-lay concept, but very little
work has been done on the actual hardware and equipment
needed for this type of system. Most of the systems
proposed have utilized existing semi-submersible drilling
units. These units, which are capable of being modified
for this service, were not built to be used as pipe layers
and cannot be made to be very efficient during pipe laying
operations.Another problem area in laying pipeline offshore is
the storage, transportation, and transfer of pipe to the
lay vessel. In normal operations, the line pipe for the
pipeline is transported to the field in
