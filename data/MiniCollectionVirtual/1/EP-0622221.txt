<ABSTRACT>
A sheet feeder for a computer driven printer moves a 
sheet of paper from a supply stack to a holding station at which 

movement of the sheet of paper is temporarily stopped. Any skew 
present in the leading edge of the paper is automatically removed 

by engagement of the leading edge with a pair of spaced bights 
(26, 28) between opposed rollers (30, 34; 32, 36) before the 

paper progresses from the holding station to a printing station. 
One sheet of paper can temporarily remain in the holding station 

as a previously fed sheet of paper is simultaneously being passed 
from the holding station to the printing station or it can pass 

essentially continuously through the holding station on its way 
to the printing station. Separate motors (20, 40) for driving 

paper feed rollers (12, 14) and paper drive rollers (30, 32) 
permit implementation of different algorithms to accomplish this 

objective.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to print media sheet feeders for computer
driven printer/plotters of the type which have a path of travel of the paper or
other print medium through the printer in a fore and aft direction and a print
head carriage mounted on one or more slider rods which moves back and forth
transversely of the path of paper travel through the printer. As used herein, the
term "paper" is used for convenience but is intended to include other media on
which printing is to take place such as transparent sheets and the like.Typical prior art printers use paper feeders which pick a sheet of paper
from a stack and continuously feed the sheet from the stack through the printer
past the print heads to an output tray or basket. In such arrangements, the
printing cannot commence until the sheet of paper has traversed the entire length
of the paper path from the paper stack to the printing station. Also, the sheet of
paper often becomes skewed during passage from the stack to the printing
station. In an attempt to alleviate one or more of these problems, DE A4 132 847
discloses a printing apparatus which has a feed mechanism based on information
from a host computer.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to reduce the time for
printing and to de-skew the paper immediately before it enters the print station.The present invention provides a method of feeding sheets of paper from
a stack thereof in a path of paper travel through a computer-driven printer/plotter
comprising the steps of:
a) rotating a sheet feed roller which engages a leading edge portion of
a sheet of paper in said stack to move said paper from said stack to a holding
station in said printer at a first rate of speed; b) guiding said sheet of paper in movement from said stack to said
holding station where the leading edge of said sheet of paper is proximate a pair
of spaced bights between spaced pairs of opposed rollers in the printer and at
which further movement of the sheet of paper is temporarily stopped;c) terminating movement of paper from said stack by said sheet feed
roller; andd) commencing rotation of said drive rollers to move said sheet of
paper between said drive rollers and said pinch rollers at a second rate of speed
from said holding station through a printing station when the leading edge portion
of said paper is engaged with each of said bights at said holding station, said
bights being defined by opposed sheet drive rollers and pinch rollers located on
opposite sides of the centerline of the path of

A method of feeding sheets of paper from a stack (10) thereof in a path
of paper travel through a computer-driven printer/plotter (2) comprising the steps

of:

a) rotating a sheet feed roller (12,14) which engages a leading edge
portion of a sheet of paper in said stack (10) to move said paper from said stack

to a holding station in said printer at a first rate of speed;
b) guiding said sheet of paper in movement from said stack to said
holding station where the leading edge of said sheet of paper is proximate a pair

of spaced bights (26,28) between spaced pairs of opposed drive and pinch rollers
(30,34;32,36) in the printer and at which further movement of the sheet of paper

is temporarily stopped;
c) terminating movement of paper from said stack by said sheet feed
roller (12,14); and
d) commencing rotation of said drive rollers (30,32) to move said
sheet of paper between said drive rollers and said pinch rollers (34,36) at a

second rate of speed from said holding station through a printing station when the
leading edge portion of said paper is engaged with each of said bights (26,28) at

said holding station, said bights being defined by opposed sheet drive rollers and
pinch rollers located on opposite sides of the centerline (C) of the path of paper

travel;
e) wherein said first rate of speed is faster than said second rate of
speed.
The method of claim 1, wherein said paper movement is arrested
at said holding station by engagement of the leading edge of said sheet with said

pair of spaced bights (26,28).
The method of claim 2, further comprising the steps of rotating said
feed roller (12,14) until said leading edge of said sheet of paper has been moved

a predetermined distance between said bights and thereafter terminating rotation
of said feed roller. 
The method of claim 1, wherein movement of paper from said stack
by said sheet feed roller is terminated by terminating rotation of said sheet feed

roller.
The method of claim 1, wherein movement of paper from said stack
by said sheet feed roller is terminated by disengaging said sheet feed roller from

said stack.
A sheet feeder for a computer-driven printer comprising:

a) a sheet feed roller (12,14) and means (20-24) for intermittently
rotating said sheet feed roller to feed a sheet of paper from a stack of paper to

a holding station at a first rate of speed;
b) at least one sheet drive roller (30,32) on each side of and spaced
from the centerline (c) of paper travel and means (38-44) for intermittently

rotating said drive rollers to drive a sheet of paper from said holding location to
a printing station;
c) a plurality of pinch rollers (34,36) between said holding station and
said printing station, each said pinch roller being opposed to and biased toward

an associated drive roller (30,32) to define a paper path therebetween:
d) guide means (50,60) for guiding a sheet of paper from said stack
to position the leading edge thereof in bights (26,28) between said opposed drive

rollers and pinch rollers; and
e) roller drive timing means for energizing said means for

means for intermittently rotating said drive rollers to move said sheet through

said bights to said printing station at a second rate of speed, wherein said first
rate of speed is faster than said second rate of speed.
