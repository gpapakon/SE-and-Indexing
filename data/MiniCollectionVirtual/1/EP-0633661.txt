<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a remote control 
device having a touch sensitive screen which both 

displays a set of icons for controlling a given device 
and is the means by which input is effected by the 

user. The screen can receive hand written instructions 
or finger pressure on specific areas of the screen. 

Character recognition is used to identify the hand 
written inputs. 
A control signal can be generated by the remote 
controller to effect programming and control of 

electrical equipment, such as TV's, videos, stereos and 
the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to remote control
systems for use with, for example, television sets,
videos, stereos and any other equipment where remote
control can be used.Many pieces of electrical equipment can be
controlled by remote control devices. These devices
typically include a key pad by which data can be
entered by the user. The data is then interpreted by
appropriate electronic circuitry and an IR signal is
transmitted to the equipment to enable the control of
the equipment.With conventional remote controls, each
different type of TV or video usually needs a
completely different remote control, since there are
different functions and facilities for different
televisions or videos. Obviously, this means the
manufacturer will have to make many different remote
controllers to cope with equipment's requirements
derived from customer's needs. The invention provides a
means to greatly simplify the development, production
and maintenance costs of remote controls, by providing
only one mechanical model customisable via software. In addition, use of the remote controller may
be very difficult for certain functions. For example,
when one is programming a video, via the remote
controller, to come on at a certain time and on a
certain day for a specified period of time, it is
necessary to press many buttons in a given sequence. It
is very easy to make a mistake either with or without
realising it. This can mean either having to reprogram
the video or missing the program you had wanted to
watch through errant programming.WO-A-8903085 discloses a remote control device
for remotely controlling one or more pieces of
electrical equipment comprising a touch sensitive
screen for displaying symbols indicative of control
variables of the or each respective piece of equipment
and for receiving inputs from a user, in use, a
microcontroller for generating the respective set of
symbols and interpreting said input, transmitter means
for transmitting a control signal to the equipment in
response to instructions from the microcontroller, and
a memory for storing one or more of said sets of
symbols accessible, in use, by the microcontroller to
display the required set of symbols on said screen.DE-A-4011067 discloses a transmitter for a
remote control comprising a switch device to provide a
set of commands including a plurality of operation
switches and a control device to generate a remote
control signal.JP-A-05035387 discloses a device comprising a

<CLAIMS>
A remote control device (136) for remotely
controlling one or more pieces of electrical equipment

comprising a touch sensitive screen (138) for
displaying one or more sets of icons indicative of

control variables of the or each respective piece of
equipment and for receiving inputs from a user, in use;

a microcontroller (210) for generating the respective
set of icons and interpreting said inputs; transmitter

means (216) for transmitting a control signal to the
equipment in response to instructions from the

microcontroller; (210); and a memory (212) for storing
one or more of said sets of icons accessible, in use,

by the microcontroller to display the required set of
icons on said screen, characterized in that the inputs

from the user are in the form script written characters
entered on the screen (138) with a stylus (140) and the

device further comprises character recognition means
(210) for recognising the user inputs.
A remote control device according to claim
1, characterized in that inputs are made by touching

icons appearing on the screen.
