<ABSTRACT>
To transmit PALplus helper signals, a level range around the blanking level reaching into the blacker-than-black region is provided. The helper signal is modulated onto the colour subcarrier. However, the said level range is not or only partially covered by standardized insertion test signals. According to the invention, the television signal contains a test signal which provides for analysis of the PALplus signal supplied by a transmission link or by a video recorder by means of components arranged within the blacker-than-black region. The test signal also contains frequence components which are within the frequency range of the colour subcarrier modulated with the PALplus signals. The test signal can be a cosine squared pulse at colour subcarrier frequency, the spectrum of which is adapted to the PALplus signal spectrum.

Method for measurement, adjustment and/or
distortion elimination (134) of transmission channels

(11) and/or decoders for a television signal, with a
test signal which is contained in the television signal

being evaluated and with the television signal being a
television signal, in particular a PALplus signal,

which is supplied from a transmission path or a video
recorder or a TV decoder (121,122,123;131,132,133) and

has additional video signal information added to it,
characterized in that the mesurement, adjustment and/or

distortion elimination are/is carried out (139) with
the assistance of amplitude components of the test

signal which are below the blanking level of a standard
composite-video signal, with the test signal containing

frequency components, which essentially cover the
frequency range of the expanded television signal, and

with the test signal containing a cosine-square pulse
on a carrier.
Method according to Claim 1, with the carrier
frequency of the cosine-square pulse being identical to

the frequency for the modulation of PALplus helper
signals.
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, with
the determining time constant T* of the cosine-square

pulse being between 450 ns and 2000 ns.
Method according to one of Claims 1 - 3, with
the measurement, adjustment and/or distortion

elimination (134) being carried out automatically.
Method according to one of Claims 1 - 4, with
the test signal being used for measurement, adjustment

and/or distortion elimination of a demodulation device
for PALplus helper signals.
Method according to one of Claims 1-5, with
the test signal being arranged in the vertical blanking

interval instead of the 20 T pulse of test line 17 or
in that half of the first and/or last active line of

the television frame in which there is no video signal. 
Method according to Claim 6, with the test
signal being arranged instead of the 20 T pulse in test

line 17.
