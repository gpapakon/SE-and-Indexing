<ABSTRACT>
An image pick-up apparatus comprising an image sensor with a matrix of 
radiation-sensitive elements, notably a CCD image sensor, is provided with a control 

circuit for selecting gate electrodes as collecting gate electrodes or as isolating gate 
electrodes by application of an electric potential of suitable polarity. Groups of 

collecting gate electrodes are separated from one another by isolating gate electrodes. 
The surface area of such a group of collecting gate electrodes co-determines the 

modulation transfer function and hence the spatial resolution of the image sensor; this 
surface area, and hence the spatial resolution, can be adjusted by adjustment of the 

electric potentials. Notably the spatial resolution can be rendered dependent on the 
different modes of operation of the image pick-up apparatus, for example when the 

image pick-up apparatus forms part of an X-ray examination apparatus which is suitable 
for fluoroscopy as well as for making X-ray images. Furthermore, the spatial resolution 

can be adjusted so that it differs in different directions. In the case of an image pick-up 
apparatus comprising a plurality of image sensors, each of which picks up the same 

image, be it with a shift relative to one another, an image is composed from the images 
supplied by the various image sensors. Differentiation of the spatial resolutions of the 

images constituting the composite image enables a spatial resolution in the composite 
image to be achieved which is the same and higher in all directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image pick-up apparatus, comprising an image
sensor with a plurality of gate electrodes which define light-sensitive elements in a
semiconductor body which convert incident radiation into collected charge carriers, and
also comprising a control circuit for the gate electrodes. The invention also relates to an
X-ray examination apparatus comprising such an image pick-up apparatus.An image pick-up apparatus of this kind is known from United States
Patent Specification US 4,926,225.The known image pick-up apparatus comprises an image sensor with light-sensitive
elements in a semiconductor body which are separated by gate electrodes, thus
forming a -called charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. When light radiation is
incident on a photosensitive element, electric charges are released at the area of said
element by absorption of light quanta and collected as a charge package with an amount
of charge which corresponds to the intensity of the incident light radiation. The
photosensitive elements together pick up a light image by conversion into a charge
carrier image, the brightness value in a pixel of the light image corresponding to the
charge in a corresponding light-sensitive element. The prior-art image pick-up
apparatus
comprises a control circuit in order to adjust the electric voltage applied to the gate
electrodes in conformity with a selected mode of operation of the image pick-up
apparatus. The region of a light-sensitive element wherefrom charges are collected
extends from the charge collection region of the light-sensitive element in the depth
direction of the semiconductor body. The depth of the region wherefrom charge is
collected can be influenced by adjustment of the gate voltage. In order to reduce
crosstalk between neighbouring light-sensitive elements, notably for radiation having a
comparatively long wavelength such as, for example infrared light, in the prior-art
image
pick-up apparatus the depth of the regions of the light-sensitive elements wherefrom
charge is collected is reduced as the wavelength of the incident radiation is longer, and
hence the penetration depth of the incident radiation is greater. The charge released by 
deeply penetrating radiation which is incident on a light-sensitive element is thus prevented
from being collected in a neighbouring light-sensitive element where it would cause crosstalk.
Consequently, during operation of the known image pick-up apparatus crosstalk is avoided
when incident image-carrying radiation of great
