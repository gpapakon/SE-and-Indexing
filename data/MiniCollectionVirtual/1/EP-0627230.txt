<ABSTRACT>
A metered dose inhaler comprises a piston (3) which is mounted 
in a cavity (2) within a body (1), and is urged by a pre-loaded 

spring (6) into a reduced cross-section pressure chamber (4). The 
piston (3) may be loaded by means of an actuating rod (31) having 

a handle (32), and may be latched in a loaded position by a latching 
means (33). A liquid drug (e.g. in aqueous solution) is contained 

in a collapsible bag (10). Metered quantities of the drug are 
successively presented in the pressure chamber (4), and then 

subjected to a sudden and great increase in pressure, to eject the 
liquid drug through an atomising head (22), to reduce it to a fine 

atomised spray of small mean particle size - for example, less than 
30 micrometres. Non-return valves (13 and 23) control the flow of 

liquid through the device. The sudden pressure pulse is caused by 
releasing the spring loaded piston (3), upon depressing an actuating 

button (35) connected to the latching means (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to atomising devices and methods, and, in its
preferred forms, aims to protide self contained hand held devices for
dispensing droplets of a mean size
less than about 10 to 12 micrometres without the use of
pressurised gas or liquefied propellants, and methods
for administering fluid droplets to a locus. In an attempt to overcome the problems associated with CFC
propellants, there have been many proposals to adapt the
mechanical pump type dispensers used to spray furniture
polishes, hair lacquers and the like. In such devices a
manually operated piston and cylinder or flexing diaphragm
type of pump is operated by depressing an axial plunger or
via a trigger type mechanism to force a fluid composition
through a mechanical break up device, for example a swirl
chamber and fine bore nozzle orifice, to form a spray of
droplets without the use of a propellant gas or airstream.
In general, the droplets formed are of a comparatively
large size, typically 30 to 200 micrometres diameter; and
the volume of the spray discharged at each operation of the
pump is of little concern to the user. Furthermore, it has not hitherto been considered possible
to achieve the required very small droplet size
consistently. A conventional hand operated pump type
sprayer is typically operated by the user manually
depressing the free end of the pump housing or plunger or
a trigger mechanism so as to discharge fluid held in the
pump, for example from the cylinder of the pump as the
piston of the pump is driven up the cylinder, see for
example US Patents Nos 3,838,686, 4,693,675 and 4,694,977.
However, not only is the pressure generated by the pump
comparatively low, but the pressure generated will depend
upon the speed at which the pump is operated and the
strength of the user. As a result, the droplet size in the
spray varies from operation to operation, even with the
same person operating the pump.It has been proposed to provide a spring against which the
pump mechanism acts as fluid is drawn into the pump on the
sucking stroke of the pump, for example into the cylinder
as the piston is retracted in a piston/cylinder type of
pump, see for example US Patents Nos 3,471,065, 3,790,034,
3,797,748, 4,260,082, 4,183,449 and 4,345,718. The spring
then provides a consistent driving force when released to
drive the fluid out of the pump. In these proposals, the
pump is designed so that fluid cannot escape from the
cylinder until a release or outlet valve is operated.
Therefore, the fluid is held within the pump
