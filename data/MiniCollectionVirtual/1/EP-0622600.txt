<ABSTRACT>
Oil cooler of plate-type design having at least one plate stack (4), through which flow can occur, which is provided with an inlet (10) and an outlet (11) and is arranged in a housing (1) through which flow can occur in the longitudinal direction and which is provided with an inlet and an outlet, and having sealing strips (8) which are arranged transverse to the longitudinal direction of the housing between the sides of the plate stack (4) and the walls of the housing (1) opposite said sides. The aim in such an oil cooler is to improve the cooling effect, lower the cost of production and simplify assembly. For this purpose, as the cooling water flows through the plate stack (4) and the oil flows through the housing (1) the plate stack is accommodated in an external cage (5) which is provided with grooves (6) which point towards the plate stack (4) and engage in recesses (7) in the latter. Furthermore, the sealing strips (8) are provided between the external cage (5) and housing (1), and mutually touching knobs (13) and baffles (splitters) (14) are provided in the plates (12).

Oil cooler of disk construction with at least one 
permeable set of disks (4) which is provided with an inlet and 

an outlet and is arranged in a housing (1) which is provided 
with an inlet and an outlet and can be permeated in the 

longitudinal direction thereof, and with sealing strips (6, 8, 
9) arranged between the sides of the set of disks and the 

walls of the housing opposed to them transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the housing, characterised in that, 

when cooling water flows through the set of disks (4) and oil 
through the housing (1), the set of disks (4) is held at least 

on the two sides extending in the longitudinal direction of 
the housing (1) in an external cage (5) having at least two 

grooves (6) which are directed to the set of disks (4), extend 
transversely to the longitudinal direction of the housing (1) 

and engage in corresponding recesses (7) in the lateral edges 
of the disks of the set of disks (4), in that the sealing 

strips (6, 8, 9) are arranged between the external cage (5) 
and the housing (1), in that knobs which touch one another are 

impressed in the half shells (12) which form a disk in pairs, 
and in that baffle plates (14) which reduce or prevent direct 

permeation of the disks from the inlet orifice to the outlet 
orifice are provided in the mutually connected orifices 

allowing the cooling water to flow through the set of disks 
(4). 
Oil cooler according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the sealing strips (8) are held in the grooves (6) on the 

exterior of the external cage (5). 
Oil cooler according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the baffle plates (14) in the disks have substantially 

the form of a circular cylindrical segment of which the centre 
line coincides substantially with the centre line of the inlet 

orifice/outlet orifice.  
 
Oil cooler according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that mutually facing knobs (13) on the half shells (12) 

forming a disk are soldered to one another. 
Oil cooler according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterised 
in that the external cage (5) consists of solderable sheet 

metal. 
Oil cooler according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the external cage (5) is soldered to the set of disks (4). 
Oil cooler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that oil baffle plates are provided between 

the disks. 
Oil cooler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the disks, the baffle plates (14) 

provided therein, the external cage (5) and the oil baffle 
plates consist of the same aluminium alloy. 
Oil cooler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the housing (1) is a component of a 

housing block of an oil filter produced by diecasting.
