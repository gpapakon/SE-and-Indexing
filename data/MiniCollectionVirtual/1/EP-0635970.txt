<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a color film analyzer for displaying 
simulated color print images of a plurality of picture frames 

of a color film and a plurality of reference color images in 
a matrix pattern on a video image display device. The 

analyzer comprises a color TV camera, memory means for 
storing color image data and means for processing said color 

image data read out from said memory means for a simulation 
of color print image of each picture frame. The memory means 

is divided into memory blocks corresponding to one of a 
column and a line of a matrix pattern, one of said memory 

blocks being allocated for storing color image data of said 
plurality of reference color images, whereas the remaining 

memory blocks are allocated for storing said color image data 
of said plurality of picture frames provided by said color 

TV camera, wherein said reference color images are different 
scenes comprising properly exposed color image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
used for analysing or inspecting color films.Video type color film analyzers are well known in the art.
One example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. JP-A-62 - 141,530 has a color TV camera for providing color image
data of picture frames of a number of rolls of color films
spliced one another. The color image data of the respective
picture frames are stored in a memory. The color image data of
each picture frame read out from the memory is, after having
been transformed in gradation based on its large area
transmittance density (LATD) and transformed from negative form
to positive form, sent to one of a plurality of CRT displays
arranged in a line to display a simulated color image thereon.
Color film analyzer of this type can display a plurality of
color images, simulated and to be simulated, on the CRT
displays in a line. The center CRT display displays a color
image under inspection and/or correction and the remaining CRT
displays, in particular on one side of the center CRT display,
color images inspected and corrected if needed and, on the 
opposite side of the center display, color images to be
inspected. Therefore, the simulated color image on the center
CRT display can be estimated comparing with adjacent corrected
and uncorrected color images.In another color film analyzer of this type disclosed in, for
example, U.S. Patent Nos. US-A-4 364 084 and US-A-4 531 150, the color
images simulated or to be simulated are displayed in a matrix
pattern. Any one of the displayed color images, if undesirable
in color and/or density as a printed image, is specified with
such as a light pen to correct exposure. Image data of the
specified image is transformed in gradation according to the
corrected exposure so that the color image is correctly
changed in color and/or density.The image data of picture frames to be displayed are written
in and read out from an image memory as is disclosed in, for
example, European Unexamined Patent Publication No. EP-A-0 108 158.It is difficult to determine whether each simulated image is
proper in color balance and/or density.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a video type color film analyzing method and
apparatus in which simulated color images are easily judged
in color balance and/or density.The above and other objects of the present invention can be
achieved by providing a method and apparatus for displaying
color images of a plurality of picture frames and a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A video-type color film analyzer (10,32) for
displaying simulated color print images of a

plurality of picture frames of a color film (13) and
a plurality of reference color images (200-203) in a

matrix pattern on a video image display device (33),
said analyser comprising:


a color TV camera (83) for providing color image
data of said plurality of picture frames;
memory means (101;120) for storing said color image
data; and
means (84) for processing said color image data
readout from said memory means (101;120) for

simulation of color print image of each said
picture frames;
said memory means (101;120) being divided into
memory blocks corresponding to a column or a

line of said matrix pattern, one of said memory
blocks (A13-A16, B13-B16) being allocated for

storing color image data of said plurality of
reference color images (200-203), and the remaining

memory blocks being allocated for storing said color
image data of said plurality of picture frames

provided by said color TV camera (83), wherein said 
reference color images (200-203) displayed in said

column or line of said matrix pattern are
different scenes comprising properly exposed color

image data.
A video-type color film analyzer (10;32) as defined
in claim 1, further comprising:


image specifying means (40) for specifying an
entire one of said color images to be corrected for

at least one of color and density,

wherein the column or line of said color
image matrix, in which said specified entire one of

said color images is disposed, is shifted to
the column or line of said reference color

images.
A video-type color film analyzer as defined in
claim 1 or 2,

wherein said reference images are recorded in a 
magnetic floppy disk (29) and transferred to said

memory block of said memory means (101;120) from
said magnetic floppy disk (29); and


shift means (40) for shifting the column
or line of color images which includes said

specified entire one of said color images so that
said spe
cified entire one of said color images is
adjacent to said column or line where

said reference color images are disposed.
