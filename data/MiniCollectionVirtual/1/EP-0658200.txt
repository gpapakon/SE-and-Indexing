<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides isolated DNA molecules comprising a DNA segment encoding a glucagon receptor. Also provided are DNA constructs comprising a first DNA segment encoding a glucagon receptor operably linked to additional DNA segments required for the expression of the first DNA segment, as well as host cells containing such DNA constructs. The present invention also provides amethod for detecting the presence of glucagon antagonists, comprising the steps of (a) exposing a compound in the presence of a glucagon agonist to a recombinant glucagon receptor coupled to a response pathway under conditions and for time sufficient to allow binding of the compound to the receptor and an associated response through the pathway, and (b) detecting a reduction in the stimulation of the response pathway resulting from the binding of the compound to the glucagon receptor, relative to the stimulation of the response pathway by the glucagon agonist alone and therefrom determining the presence of a glucagon antagonist.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cell surface receptors,
and more specifically, to glucagon receptors.Glucagon is a 29 amino acid hormone produced by the alpha cells
of pancreatic islets. Glucagon is responsible for the maintenance of normal
levels of glucose in many animals, including humans, by acting as an insulin-counteracting
hormone. In particular, while insulin is known to rapidly decrease
blood glucose levels, glucagon counter-balances these effects by contributing to
the elevation of blood glucose levels.The interactions of glucagon and insulin are very important to the
maintenance of glucose levels within the body. An imbalance of glucagon or
insulin is believed to play a role in several diseases, such as diabetes mellitus
and diabetic ketoacidosis. According to one theory, the hyperglycemic state of
diabetes mellitus may be brought on not only by glucose under-utilization (due
to decreased insulin), but also by the overproduction of glucose due to elevated
concentrations of glucagon (see, Unger, "Diabetes and the alpha cell," Diabetes
25: 136-151, 1976; Unger and Orci, "The essential role of glucagon in the
pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus." Lancet 1:14-16, 1975).An important factor in the study of glucagon, and glucagon's role
in diseases such as diabetes mellitus, is the glucagon receptor, which, upon
binding with glucagon, transduces a signal to the cell, thereby triggering
glycogenolysis (glycogen hydrolysis), and gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis).It is presently believed that glucagon's effects are mediated in part
by the elevation of the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP). In particular, the binding of glucagon to its cellular receptor activates
adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP, thus raising the levels of intracellular 
cAMP. This elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP is believed to result in
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, with the resultant rise in glucose
production by the liver (see, Unson et al., "Bioligical Activities of des-His1
[Glu9]Glucagon Amide, a Glucagon Antagonist, "Peprides 10:1171-1177,
1989).Additional pathways, however, have also been suggested for the stimulation of
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In particular, it has been reported that
glucagon binds to receptors in the hepatocyte membrane that are coupled via a
G-protein to phospholipase C. Upon stimulation, this protein causes the
breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 biphosphate to produce the second
messengers inositol triphospate and 1,2 diacylglycerol (see,
