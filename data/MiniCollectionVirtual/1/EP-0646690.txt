<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stay 9 for holding a flap or a lid in a closed position or open position in relation to a container to be closed thereby. It has a first arm 9 and a second arm 10. These are intended to be fixed to the container and lid respectively by means of a pivot bearing. The two arms are connected to one another via a further pivot bearing. Active between the two is a compression spring 16 which supports the arms 9, 10 relative to one another in a position near to or remote from one another. For this purpose, the compression spring 16 is supported at one end 17 on the first arm 9 and at its other end 18 on the second arm 10, in such a way that, on the second arm, it is arranged eccentrically to the pivot bearing 13. In the extended position of the arms 9, 10, the engagement point of the compression spring 16 on the second arm 10 is offset to one side of a connecting line 27 between the centre point of the first pivot bearing 6 on the first arm 9 through the third pivot bearing 13 between the two arms 9, 10 and, in the position which corresponds to the closed position of the two arms and in which these are near to one another, the said engagement point is offset to the other side of the connecting line 27. This ensures a stay which is of simple design and which assumes a reliable holding-shut position, so that the holding-shut and holding-open forces can be predetermined exactly. The necessary forces for the closed position or open position can be achieved and predetermined in a simple way by exchanging the spring or by varying the support of the second arm relative to the first arm via the spring.

A support (5) for holding a closing element (2), 
especially a flap or lid, relative to a container (1) 

to be closed thereby in a closed position or open 
position, having a first and a second arm (9, 10), with 

one (9) of the arms (9, 10) being connectable to the 
container (1) by a first pivot bearing (6) and the other 

arm (10) being connectable to the closing element (2) by 
a second pivot bearing (7) and with the two arms (9, 10) 

being connected to one another by a third pivot bearing 
(13) and being supported relative to one another by a 

spring (15) acting therebetween in a position of the 
arms (9, 10) which corresponds to the closed position 

wherein the pivot bearings (6, 7) approach one another 
or a position of the arms (9, 10) which corresponds to 

the open position wherein the pivot bearings (6, 7) are 
remote from one another, with the spring (16), by means 

of one end (17), acting eccentrically on the first arm 
(9) and, by means of its other end (18), acting 

eccentrically on the second arm (10) relative to the 
third pivot bearing (13) connecting the two arms (9, 

10), and furthermore, with the contact point (18) of the 
spring (16) relative to the second arm (10), in the 

position of the arms (9, 10) corresponding to the open 
position, being offset from the connecting line (27) 

between the centre of the first pivot bearing (6) at the 
first arm (9) through the third pivot bearing (13) 

between the two arms (9, 10) towards one side and 
in the closed position towards the other side of the 

connecting line (27),
 
characterised in
  
 

that the first arm (9) is provided in the form of a 
closed housing (11) with a cavity (19) and with a 

through-aperture (25) for the second arm (10); that the 
second arm (10) is supported in the cavity (19) in the 

third pivot bearing (13) and laterally guided in the 
cavity (19); and that the spring provided in the form of 

a pressure spring (16) is received in the cavity (19) 
and supported by means of its ends at the two arms (9, 

10). 
A support according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the position of the arms (9, 10) relative to one 

another, in their position corresponding to the open 
position, is delimited by stops (30, 31). 
A support according to claim 2,
 
characterised in
 
that the eccentricity (28) and thus the effective lever 

arm of the pressure spring (16), with reference to the 
connecting line (27), in the position of the arms (9, 

10) corresponding to the closed position, and the spring 
rate of the pressure spring (16) are calculated to achieve 

the required closing force. 
A support according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the eccentricity (19) and thus the effective lever 

arm of the pressure spring (16), with reference to the 
connecting line (27), in the position of the arms (9, 

10) corrsponding to the open position, and the spring 
rate of the pressure spring (16) are calculated to achieve 

the required supporting force for the closing element 
(2). 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in
  
 

that the housing (11) is closed by a cover (12) and that 
the second arm (10) is laterally guided between the 

housing (11) and the cover (12). 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in
 
that the pressure spring (16) is received on a guiding 

bar (24) which is provided with a bearing lever (20). 
A support according to claim 6,
 
characterised in
 
that the bearing lever (20), together with a bearing 

bore (22) of the second arm (10), forms the supporting 
means for the pressure spring (16) at the second arm 

(10). 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in
 
that the two arms (9, 10) are made of plastics, 

especially acetal homopolymer (POM). 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised
 
by being arranged at a container (1) with a closing 

element (2) which is optionally pivotable around the one 
or the other of two parallel side edges (3, 4), with the 

pivot bearing (6) of the first arm (9) being articulated 
at the container (1) and the pivot bearing (7) of the 

second arm (10) being articulated at the closing element 
(2), in each case centrally between the two side edges 

(3, 4) at the container (1) and the closing element (2) 
respectively.
