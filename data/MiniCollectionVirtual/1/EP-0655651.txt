<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a photosensitive material for the production of metal-coloured images which comprises     A) a transparent, flexible base film (support film) of plastic, B) a photosensitive layer containing a polymeric binder, a photosensitive substance and a pearlescent pigment, and optionally   C) a thermoplastic adhesive layer.   The material according to the invention enables the production of colour proofing images for metal-coloured multicolour prints, where metal-coloured single-colour images can if desired be combined with single-colour images in the conventional primary colours.

<CLAIMS>
Photosensitive material for making images bearing 
metal-like colours, which comprises 


A) a transparent flexible plastics support film, 
B) a 0.5 to 20 µm-thick photosensitive layer which 
contains a polymeric binder, a photosensitive 

substance and a pigment, and 
C) a thermoplastic adhesive layer, 
 
characterised in that the pigment is a pearlescent 

pigment which contains as a carrier material 
transparent mineral particles of a diameter of from 5 

to less than 50 µm. 
Photosensitive material according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the pearlescent pigment is 

coloured. 
Photosensitive material according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the diameter of the pearlescent 

pigment particles is from 5 to 20 µm. 
Photosensitive material according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the photosensitive layer (B) 

contains in addition to the pearlescent pigment 
another coloured pigment or a dye. 
Photosensitive material according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the pearlescent pigment 

particles comprise a carrier material which is formed 
from a plate-like sheet silicate, whereof the surface 

is coated with a white pigment, a coloured pigment or 
a dye.  

 
Photosensitive material according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that during exposure the adhesion of 

the photosensitive layer vis-à-vis adjacent surfaces 
changes. 
Photosensitive material according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that during exposure the solubility 

of the photosensitive layer changes. 
Process for making an image bearing metal-like 
colours, characterised in that a photosensitive 

material of the composition indicated in Claim 1 is 
laminated with the adhesive layer onto an image-receiving 

material under pressure and, before or after 
lamination, is exposed through the support film with a 

colour separation image, and the support film, 
together with the exposed areas of the photosensitive 

layer, is peeled from the image-receiving material. 
Process for making an image bearing metal-like 
colours, characterised in that a photosensitive 

material of the composition indicated in Claim 1 is 
laminated with the adhesive layer onto an image-receiving 

material under pressure and, before or after 
lamination, is exposed imagewise, the support film is 

removed before or after exposure, and the exposed or 
unexposed areas of the photosensitive layer are washed 

out with a developer solution. 
Process according to one of Claims 9 and 10, 
characterised in that the image-receiving material is 

a paper sheet.  
 
Process according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
the image-receiving material is a paper sheet having 

applied to it a colour image.
