<ABSTRACT>
A multi-cell stent has a stent structure with at least two different types of cells, including a
first type of cell and a second type of cell. Each type of cell preferably accomplishes a

different purpose. For example, a first type of cell (11) can provide a maximum radial rigidity
after stent deployment. A second type of cell (12) can provide increased longitudinal flexibility

prior to stent deployment and after stent deployment into a main artery. The second type of
cell can be readily balloon expanded at the ostium of a side branch artery to a comparatively

large diameter without breaking any of the struts of the stent cell. With this combination,
for example, unobstructed blood flow into the side branch can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is an expandable stent insertable into a vessel of a human body for the
purpose of creating and maintaining the patency of that vessel.Some of the earliest stents were merely helical coils that expanded radially outward after being
placed in a vessel of a human body. More recent stents have used uniform cellular structures
with the stent typically being expanded radially outward into a vessel by means of a balloon
located at a distal portion of a balloon angioplasty catheter. After radial expansion, some of
these stents have struts or wires that tend to block a side branch artery which comes off a main
artery into which the stent has been placed. With an expandable balloon, it is possible to break
open a strut of a particular cell of such a stent where the struts of that cell are impending blood
flow into that side branch. However, breaking open such a cell can leave strut ends protruding
into he lumen of the side branch or the main artery itself which is highly undesirable. Also,
breaking a cell open weakens the stent structure.US patent US-A-5,449,373 describes:
an articulated stent for delivering through a bodily conduit, for example, a peripheral or
coronary artery, which has one or more curved portions and for implantation therein. The
articulated stent includes at least two substantially rigid segments and a flexible connector for
connecting adjacent segments. The connector assumes a cylindrical configuration when relaxed
and a differentially stretched and compressed curved configuration when flexed. According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a multi-cell stent (10), having a
structure integrally formed as a thin-walled cylinder, the stent having a multiplicity of cells each
having a closed perimeter formed from thin, wire-like struts and curved sections and each cell
having two longitudinally separated ends, the perimeter of at least some of the cells of the multi-cell
stent including a pair of vertical struts (13) extending in a generally circumferential
direction and being longitudinally displaced each with respect to the other at the longitudinally
separated ends of each cell, each vertical strut having two curved end sections each being joined
to a diagonal strut (14) thereby forming a pair of diagonal struts connected to the two curved
end sections (17) of each vertical strut, at least one cell of the multi-cell stent being an
expandable cell forming a first type of cell (12), which includes within its perimeter at least one
undulating strut (16), the

cylindrical segments, each cylindrical segment consisting of only one type of cell, each

cylindrical segment having at least three cells disposed circumferentially and being one cell
wide in the longitudinal direction.

the first type of cells which cells are adapted to be expanded to a generally circular shape by

means of an inflatable balloon that is placed through the closed perimeter of the first type of cell
