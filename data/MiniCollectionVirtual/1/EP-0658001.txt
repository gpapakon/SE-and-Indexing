<ABSTRACT>
A comparator circuit for a switched resistive network, which may be combined with a 
transconductance amplifier, simultaneously and independently compares a plurality of input 

voltages to a reference voltage. The circuit comprises a current splitter having a current input, a 
plurality of comparator outputs, and a corresponding plurality of voltage inputs that control the 

fraction of the input current available at each comparator output. A reference output of the 
current splitter is provided as an input to a current mirror, and each of the comparator outputs 

of the current splitter is connected to a corresponding output of the current mirror. The current 
available at each of the current mirror outputs is a function of the reference input provided from 

the current splitter. The comparator circuit needs only one bias input and one reference input. 
The inclusion of a second biasing device with an associated mirror device produces a 

transconductance amplifier combined with the comparator circuit. This combination minimizes 
the integrated circuit area required for transconductors and comparators on image processing 

chips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic comparator circuits and, in particular, to a
comparator circuit for a switched resistive network in which a plurality of inputs are
simultaneously and independently compared to a reference input. A multiple input comparator according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-4 590 391.Special purpose analog processors have been previously developed for computationally
intensive machine vision tasks such as edge detection and noise point removal. Such
processors can be implemented on a single VLSI chip using a standard CMOS fabrication
process. Generally, they are compact, low cost, low power systems that can accept raw image
data and provide a digital output (such as an edge map), a processed gray-level image, or both.
Many of these chips include an array of photodetectors so that an image can be focused directly
onto the surface of the die. Other versions allow external data to be scanned in, as from an
infrared focal-plane array, for example. The resolution is limited primarily by the fabrication
process linewidth, the maximum die size, and the circuit design.Image smoothing, which can be implemented with a resistive grid, is generally the first
step in edge detection. At any given pixel, the presence of an edge can be determined by
comparing various quantities at or near that pixel. The difference between two adjacent pixels
of a smoothed image can be used to detect an edge. If the absolute value of this difference
exceeds a certain threshold, an edge is declared. This can be done on an image processor chip
with a voltage comparator. The brightness at each pixel is represented by a voltage source, and
the smoothed voltage appears on the resistor network (or "grid"). The resistors connecting
adjacent pixels can be denoted Hres ("horizontal" resistors), and those connecting the data
source to the smoothed node can be denoted Vres ("vertical" resistors), the nature of the
smoothing being determined by their i-v curves. The comparator at a pixel opens a switch in
series with the Hres if and only if the voltage across the Hres (of either sign) exceeds a certain
threshold, corresponding to a reasonably definite edge. The network, however, has hysteresis:
when a switch opens, the comparator voltage increases even further. To assure a unique 
solution for each image frame, the thresholds must be raised temporarily (to close all the
switches) and then gradually lowered. Thus, the strongest edges get detected first. Once the
edges are found, the network
