<ABSTRACT>
A lead frame forms the base for at least one IC fastened thereto. The first ends of the lead frame are electrically connected to the connections of the IC and encapsulated together with the IC in a plastic housing. The second ends of the lead frame are designed as plug-connection elements projecting out of the housing.

<CLAIMS>
A microsensor having a connector terminal, in which at least one integrated circuit 
(IC) is secured in a synthetic housing, a leadframe forming the base of at least one IC (9) 

secured thereto, and the leadframe comprising a plurality of elongate parallel parts 
whereof the first ends (3, 4, 5), at the housing end, are electrically connected to the 

terminals of the IC (9) and are embedded together with the IC (9) in the synthetic housing 
(1), 
characterised in that
 the second ends (6, 7, 8) lying opposite the first ends (3, 4, 5) are 
constructed as connector terminal elements which project out of the housing (1) and are to 

be electrically connected purely by insertion, and in that the leadframe is of two-stepped 
construction, the first ends (3, 4, 5) of the leadframe being flatter than the second ends (6, 

7, 8) at the connector terminal end of the leadframe. 
A microsensor according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 apart from the IC (9) 
additional discrete structural elements (10) are secured to the first ends (3, 4, 5) of the 

leadframe and are electrically connected to these ends. 
A microsensor according to one of Claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that
 a sensor IC 
and a bus interface IC are arranged on the leadframe. 
A microsensor according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the 
microsensor is constructed as a switchable magnetic field sensor, and in that at least one 

permanent magnet (12) is also embedded in the synthetic housing (1). 
A microsensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
connector terminal elements (6, 7, 8) are constructed as the blade contacts of a plug 

connector. 
A microsensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
connector terminal elements (6, 7, 8) are constructed as crimp connections. 
A microsensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
connector terminal elements (6, 7, 8) are constructed as insulation displacement 

connections.
