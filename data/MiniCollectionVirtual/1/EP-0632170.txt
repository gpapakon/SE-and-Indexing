<ABSTRACT>
A preformed multilayer structure for sealing coverings 
and roofings, formed by a layer (1) of a bitumen-based blend 

embedding a framework (2), and by a layer (5) of a preforming 
auxiliary material which forms the external surface thereof. 

An additional resin layer (3) of elastomeric copolymers in 
water emulsion, and a further additional layer (4) comprising 

a binder can be provided. 
The structure is incorporated in accessories of the 
building construction field of various shapes and types (10, 

15, 20, 25, 30, 38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the external sealing of
buildings and other kinds of constructions, and more
particularly multilayer and preformed accessories to be used
at the junctions between separate sealing coatings based on
bitumen, such as for example at corners, openings, etc. in
buildings, roofs and the like.For sealing or rendering rainproof buildings, e.g. at
terraces, roofs, etc. there are used the so called bitumen-polymer
membranes, formed by a framework which is impregnated
and coated by a bituminous mixture with added polymers. The
framework can comprise a continuos yarn or a nonwoven
polyester staple fabric and/or a so called nonwoven glass, or
glass fibers.Plastomers can be added to the bituminous mixture, such
as atactic polypropylene, i.e. having a random strucure, (so
called APP-Bitumen membranes), or elastomers such as block
copolymers (so called membranes of styrol-butadiene SBS
bitumen). Due to the physical characteristics of the polymer
employed, the former are also called bitumen-polymer
plastomeric membranes, while the latter are defined as
bitumen-polymer elastomeric membranes.In the sealing and rainproofing operations most of the 
continuous waterproof roofing or covering is built with these
bitumen membranes comprising a framework which is impregnated
by a hot bituminous mixture.The edge of the waterproof roofing accomplished by means
of bituminous sheaths, where the horizontal and the vertical
surfaces are to be joined together, is the most critic area of
the roofing and requires a proper protection.For such purpose there are presently available junctions
or accessories made of synthetic materials such as PVC, EPDM,
ECBM. These known sealers are practically impervious to vapor,
but their chemical composition is not compatible with the
bituminous sheaths forming the main portion of a sealing
system. Further, such incompatibility can lead to a degraded
sealing performance because of the different degrees of
resistance to ageing and to reactions involving ultraviolet
light. Finally, such known sealers cannot be applied by using
the flame of a gas burner, usually the one used for laying the
main roofing, since the flame would melt and permanently
deform such accessories of synthetic materials.DE-U-87 09 517 on which the preamble of claim 1 is based
discloses a multilayer preformed structure for use in the
building construction accessory field for sealing coverings
and roofings comprising a bitumen-based blend layer embedding
a framework, and an auxiliary material which form the
