<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of Casting Amorphous and Macrocrystalline Micro iresBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to the production of glass-insulated microwire with amorphous or microcrystalline microstructure. A method for casting microwires in glass insulation is disclosed inUS Patent No. 3,256,584 in which the charge metal and glass are melted by means of a high field inductor, after which a metal-filled capillary is drawn and collected onto a receiving bobbin. However, the issue of controlling the microstructure of the final wire has not been addressed. Amorphous metals have no grain boundaries, can be readily doped, have a zero-temperature dependence of resistivity and possess good electrical and magnetic properties. Amorphous and microcrystalline microwires provide substantial improvements of certain properties compared to wires of similar compositions having equilibrium crystalline structures. Microcrystalline metals often have intermediate properties of amorphous and crystalline metals. The electrical resistance of the amorphous wires increases from 160 KΩ m up to 2500 KΩ/m, and it becomes possible to obtain both positive and negative thermal coefficient of resistance. In the case of magnetically soft amorphous microwires, the initial magnetic permeability increase 5-7 times, and can reach 20x103. The mechanical strength of these amorphous microwires increases.Microcrystalline and amorphous microwires are well suited for applications such as sensors of temperature, static and dynamic pressure, velocity and liquid or gas consumption. It is the object of the present invention to prepare amorphous or microαystalline glass-insulated microwires.Summary of the InventionIn one aspect of the invention, a glass-coated microwire with an amorphous metal core is prepared by providing a glass tube containing the desired metal and melting the metal in a high frequency induction field. 

 The heat of the metal softens the glass tube and a thin capillary is drawn from the softened glass tube. If the metal wets the glass surface, a metal- filled capillary tube results. The rate of cooling is controlled such that an amorphous microstructure is obtained for the metal. In another aspect of the invention, a glass-coated microwire with a microcrystalline metal core is prepared by providing a glass tube containing the desired metal and melting the metal in a high frequency induction field and further heating the melted metal so that it becomes super heated. The heat of the metal softens the glass tube and a thin
