<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a coupling device for power-and-free conveyors in the case of which coupling carriages (3), which are drawn by a drag chain (2), have movable coupling parts, which are operatively connected to rigid coupling parts on the running gears (21, 23) of running carriages (20.1, 20.2) which run on a running rail (15). A coupling hook (5) is fastened to the coupling carriage (3) and has a front stopping slope (11) and an approximately rectangular cut-out (8) which is open at the bottom and has a carrying edge (8.1) and a holding edge (8.2). A locking finger (9) is fastened in a pendulum-like fashion in the cut-out (8) and its swinging angle is limited in the direction of the holding edge (8.2). The cut-out (8) is longer than the front gears (21) but shorter than the rear gears (23). This dimensioning and the stop slope (11) mean that the coupling device can be stored. It is also extremely reliable in operation and cheap as only two moving parts are present.
