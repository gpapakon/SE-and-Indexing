<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention consists of 
pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of 
thalassemia, containing butyric acid derivatives as 
active ingredient, particularly isobutyramide, said 
compositions being in the form of capsules and 
suppositories. It is known from EP 0 371 789 and from US 
4,822,821 that butyric or isobutyric acid and their 
derivatives can be used for the therapy of the clinical 
effects of β-globin disorders and in particular of 
thalassemiae. Under this name are grouped chronic, 
family-, haemolytic anaemias, occurring in certain 
geographical areas, particularly in the coastal 
Mediterranean countries, it is also referred as 
"Mediterranean anaemia", which is characterized by the 
production of abnormally thin erythrocytes, which show 
an accentuated mechanical fragility. Etiology of this 
disorder involves a reduced synthesis of the hemoglobin 
β- or α- polypeptide chain, and an insufficient 
erythropoiesis. The symptoms are those of a severe 
anaemia: jaundice, leg ulcers, cholelithiasis. 
Splenomegaly is frequent, so that spleen can become 
enormous. A collapse of the erythrocyte number occurs, 
and also the mean corpuscular volume is abnormously 
low. Few patients survive beyond puberty. According to the above mentioned European and 
United States patents, moderate therapeutical results 
can be obtained by administering butyric acid and its  
 
salts, α-aminobutyric acid, B-chloro-D-alanine, 
isobutyric acid, isobutyramide and others. Although 
said references mention the possibility to administer 
the active ingredient in capsules (or tablets), and 
other oral forms, it appears that the treatments are 
practically carried out by introducing the medicament 
directly in the blood stream (see EP 0 371 789, pag. 3, 
line 20 and following). It has now been found that therapeutically more 
encouraging results are obtained by administering the 
butyric acid derivatives, and particularly the 
isobutyramide, in the form of capsules or 
suppositories. The unitary doses of active ingredient 
(preferably isobutyramide) are comprised between 100 
and 500 mg for capsules, and between 500 and 1,500 mg 
for suppository. In the case of capsules a controlled 
release form, wherein the active ingredient is admixed 
with a controlled release hydrophilic matrix, proved to 
be particularly effective. The suppositories can contain a base consisting of 
common fatty acids or polyethylene glycol. The daily dosage can be such as to provide about 
1.2 g of active ingredient
