Immediate-effect medicament for the treatment of 
painful and/or inflammatory, and also febrile, disorders, 

containing ibuprofen in addition to customary pharmaceutical 
excipients and auxiliaries, characterized in 

that the ibuprofen is present in the form of a pharmaceutically 
administrable nanosol which essentially 

contains gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate or a gelatin 
derivative as the excipient, the nanosol 


a) having an inner phase of ibuprofen which has a 
particle size of 10 - 800 nm and possesses a surface 

charge, 
b) an outer phase of gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate or 
a gelatin derivative, which is oppositely charged, 

and 
c) an approximate or complete isoionic state of charge 
of the inner and outer phase and 
d) being physiologically absorbable. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the ibuprofen is present as a liquid, aqueous 

nanodispersion. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the ibuprofen is present as a solid, resuspensible 

nanodispersion. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen has an average 

particle size of below 400 nm. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the gelatin has a maximum in the 

molecular weight distribution of below 10‚Åµ D and bloom 
values of 0 - 240.  

 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
ch
aracterized in that the gelatin has a bloom value of 0 
- 170.

that the gelatin has a peptide content of 50 - 90 %. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the gelatin has a content of 

dextrorotatory amino acids of below 20 %. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the weight ratio of gelatin to 

active compound is 0.5 : 1 to 10 : 1, preferably 0.5 : 1 
to 3 : 1. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized by an outer phase of the nanosol which 

additionally contains polyvinylpyrrolidone in a weight 
ratio of gelatin to polyvinylpyrrolidone such as 5 : 1 to 

500 : 1, in particular 5 : 1 to 30 : 1. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the pharmaceutical form is a 

rapidly dissolving tablet. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the pharmaceutical form is a 

rapidly dissolving powder or granules. 
Medicament for the treatment of painful and/or 
inflammatory, and also febrile, disorders, containing 

ibuprofen in addition to customary pharmaceutical 
excipients and auxiliaries, characterized in that it is 

partly present as an immediate-effect form and partly as 
a sustained-release form containing ibuprofen in the form 

of a pharmaceutically administrable nanosol, the nanosol

particle size of 10 - 800 nm and possesses a surface 

charge, 
b) an outer phase of gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate or 
a gelatin derivative, which is oppositely charged, 

and 
c) an approximate or complete isoionic state of charge

racemate. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen is present as a 

pseudoracemate or as a mixture of the racemate with its 
enantiomers. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen is present as pure 

S- or R-ibuprofen. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 14,
