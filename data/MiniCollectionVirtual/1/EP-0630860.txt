<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (1) for controlling biological treatment of waste water employs a 
substantially air tight supported biological filter unit (2) having a liquid inlet (4), 

outlet (6) and exhaust gas vent (5). Substantially pure oxygen is supplied to 
said filter (2) and controlled in response to a control signal from a control 

means, adapted to monitor the oxygen consumption rate, to adjust the oxygen 
supply rate to maintain a predetermined oxygen consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlled biological 
treatment of waste water. The method and apparatus have been developed primarily for use in the 
treatment of sewage and will be described hereinafter with reference to this 
particular use. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is applicable to 
the biological treatment of other forms of waste. Essentially, there are two general types of aerobic waste water treatment 
processes. The first is commonly known as the activated sludge or suspended growth 
system. In this process, dissolved oxygen is fed into a storage tank of sludge to 
be treated, biomass forming as free-floating colonies or aggregates known as, 
"flocs". A clarification stage is usually added to this process to separate these 
flocs or sludge form the liquid component. If necessary, some of the sludge is periodically removed to prevent excessive 
solids build-up. Recycling is also practised, principally to selectively increase the 
residence time of the biomass over the hydraulic residence time. In this manner 
real time control of activated sludge systems is limited to flow control of the 
recycle sludge to maintain solids at constant levels, and control of dissolved 
oxygen injected into the system to reduce operating costs. The major problem with systems of this nature are that they are generally 
designed for maximum capacity and the effluent quality can not readily be 
controlled.  
 The other kind of treatment is known as supported growth system where the 
biomass grows on rigid support material. When the layer gets past a certain 
thickness, some of the sludge is sheared off or sloughed and has to be removed 
from the final effluent by a clarification stage. Recycling is generally practised 
to increase the liquid/biomass contact, and to dilute the incoming fluid with a 
partially treated liquid. Real time control of supported growth systems to 
achieve a predetermined effluent quality has not proved practical in the past. In summary, the key differences between activated sludge processes and other 
biological waste water treatment processes is that, operated to the present art, 
only the activated sludge process can be operated to give a reasonable 
assurance of meeting set effluent standards in the face of considerably 
fluctuating feed loadings. Other systems, such as supported growth units, and 
lagoons, have been capable to date of only removing a constant proportion of 
the pollution feed rather than meeting with a predetermined

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlled biological treatment of waste water characterised 
by the steps of: 


feeding waste water to a substantially airtight supported growth biological 
filter unit (2) that includes an exhaust gas vent (5), 
supplying substantially pure oxygen to said filter unit (2), 
measuring the oxygen consumption across said filter (2) by comparing the 
flow rate of oxygen into the filter (2) to the flow rate of oxygen exiting 

the filter (2) through said vent (5), and 
adjusting the feed rate of waste water to maintain a predetermined 
oxygen consumption. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by measuring the flow rate of 
gas venting from the biological filter unit and determining its oxygen mole 

fraction and subtracting the product of these values from the measured 
feed rate of substantially pure oxygen into the filter unit. 
A method as claimed in either of the preceding claims characterised in 
that the filter (2) is maintained at a pressure slightly above atmospheric 

pressure to prevent back-diffusion of air into the unit. 
A method as claimed in any one of the previous claims characterised in 
that waste water is fed to the upper portion of the filter unit (1) and 

treated effluent exits the filter (2) into a first reservoir (18) from which the 
product is optionally clarified and/or combined with the in-feed to the 

filter unit (1) to be recycled.  
 
A method as claimed in claim 4 characterised in 
that the recycle is adjusted until the filter unit oxygen consumption is at 

its design set point. 
An apparatus (1) for control of biological treatment of waste water 
characterised by: 


a substantially air tight supported growth biological filter unit (2) having a 
liquid inlet (4), liquid outlet (6) and exhaust gas vent (5); 
means (8) to supply substantially pure oxygen to said filter unit; 
means (10) to measure oxygen flow rate into the filter (2) and oxygen 
flow rate exiting the gas vent (5); 
feed means (22) responsive to a command signal to deliver a 
predetermined flow rate of waste water to the filter unit (20; and 
control means to compare the flow rate of oxygen into the filter and out 
of the gas vent to determine the oxygen consumption across the filter (2) 

and generate a command signal to adjust the feed means to maintain a 
predetermined oxygen consumption. 
An apparatus (1) as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in that the unit (1) 
includes means to maintain an internal pressure above atmospheric 

pressure to prevent back-diffusion of air into the unit (1). 
An apparatus (1) as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7 characterised by a wet 
well (18) which is gravity fed from an outlet adjacent to the base of the 

filter unit (2).  
 
An apparatus (1) as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 8 characterised by 
a combined sump (12) adapted to receive recycle waste water from the 

filter unit (2). 
An apparatus (1) as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 9 characterised in 
that the filter unit (2) is disposed to extract combined recycle waste and 

untreated waste from the combined sump (12). 
An apparatus (1) as claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 10 characterised 
by a clarifier or other purification or disposal means connected with the 

wet well (18) and adapted to receive a portion of the liquid flow 
therefrom.
