<ABSTRACT>
Use of a copolymer of ethylene and from 10 to 60 % by weight, based on the copolymer, of vinyl acetate as an adhesive laminating film for coating nonmetallic substrates, in particular cardboard products. At least one further protective layer is preferably applied to the adhesive laminating film. The adhesive laminating film used can be processed with nonmetallic substrates to give laminates without an expensive lamination process and is also suitable as, inter alia, a PVC substitute.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a copolymer of ethylene and from 13 to 45%
by weight, based on the copolymer, of vinyl

acetate as an adhesive laminating film for coating
nonmetallic substrates, wherein the adhesive layer

comprises no further copolymers from the group
consisting of ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers

and ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers.
Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one
further protective layer has been applied to the

adhesive laminating film.
Use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
further protective layer applied to the adhesive

laminating film comprises a thermoplastic polymer.
Use as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
the further protective layer applied to the

adhesive laminating film comprises a polyolefin.
Use as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the adhesive laminating film is used for coating

cardboard products.
