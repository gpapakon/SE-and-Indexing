<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
the use of certain compounds for the manufacture of
medicament for the treatment or prevention of
emesis in mammals, including humans.
The pharmaceutically active compounds
employed in this invention are substance P receptor
antagonists.The following references refer, collectively, to
quinuclidine, piperidine, and azanorbornane derivatives and
related compounds that exhibit activity as substance P
receptor antagonists: United States Patent 5,162,339, which

March 4, 1993.European Patent Application 533280A1, published March
24, 1993 refers to the use of substance P antagonists in the
treatment of emesis. The present invention relates to the use of a compound for the
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention
of emesis in a mammal, where the compound is selected from
the following group, or is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof: 
(2S,3S)-3-(2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethoxybenzyl)amino-2-phenylpiperidine; (2S,3S)-N-(5-isopropyl-2-methoxyphenyl)methyl-2-diphenylmethyl-1-azabicyclo
[2.2.2] octan-3-ainine; and(2S, 3S)-N-(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxyphenyl)methyl-2-diphenylmethyl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-amine.The treatment of emesis includes the treatment of
nausea, retching and vomiting. Emesis includes acute
emesis, delayed emesis and anticipatory emesis. The substance
P receptor antagonists of this invention are useful in the treatment of
emesis, however induced. For example, emesis may be induced
by drugs such as cancer chemotherapeutic agents (e.g.,
cycloph
