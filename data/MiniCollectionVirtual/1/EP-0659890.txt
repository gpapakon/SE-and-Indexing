<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a small planar anisotropic 
high-strength can steel plate. Hot-rolling is first 

performed on a steel slab at an Ar
3
 transformation point 
or higher to obtain hot rolled steel strip. The slab has 

a composition which essentially consists of and which 
satisfies the conditions of: C≦0.004%, Si≦0.02%, 

Mn=0.5% - 3%, P≦0.02%, Al=0.02% - 0.05%, 
0.008%≦N≦0.024%, and the rest being Fe and unavoidable 

impurities, wherein the conditions have the relationship 
of:Al%/N%
>
2. Then, the resultant strip is cooled at a 
cooling rate of 10°C/s or higher so as to reach a 

temperature of 650°C or lower. The resultant strip is 
further coiled at a temperature in a range of from 550°C 

to 400°C. Cold-rolling is performed on the resultant 
strip at a reduction ratio of 82% or higher preceded by 

removing a scale to obtain cold rolled steel strip. 
Subsequently, continuous annealing is performed on the 

resultant cold rolled steel strip at a recrystallization 
temperature or higher, being followed by temper-rolling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing thin can steel plate used for a tinplate,
tin-free steel, and the like. More particularly, the
invention relates to a method of manufacturing a higher-strength
can steel plate having a smaller thickness and
better workability compared to conventional can steel
plates.Can steel plates, in particular, beverage can steel
plates, are becoming thinner with a view to saving
resources and achieving weight reduction. Improvements
are being made to make the can steel plates thinner-walled.
There is also a demand for good workability in
the application of such steel plates to two-piece cans.Conventionally, for example, a box-annealing
material having a thickness of approximately 0.33mm or
greater and a tempering degree of approximately T1 (a
strength (TS) of from approximately 32 to 33kgf/mm2) is
used for DI two-piece cans. The thickness of such a
material has recently been gaged down to 0.29mm and even
to 0.25mm or smaller. Along with the downsizing of the 
material, there follows an increase in the use of high-strength
materials having a tempering degree of T2.5 (a
strength TS of approximately 37kgf/mm2), and high-strength
materials even having a tempering degree of from T3 to T4
(a strength TS of from approximately 38 to 39kgf/mm2).Further, since deep drawing is performed on the two-piece
cans in the manufacturing process, there is a
demand for a large degree of average r and a small degree
of Δr. For example, there is a demand that a DI can
steel plate should have an average r of 1.3 or greater
and Δr of 0.3 or smaller. A small degree of Δr is
demanded with a view to suppress earing during deep
drawing for improving yield of produced can and to avoid
breaking the earing during ironing performed on the
coarse form of the can and during a subsequent process of
removing the can from a punch.Although many proposals have been made for a method
of manufacturing a can steel plate, no proposal meets all
the requirements described above.For example, EP 556834A2, proposes a method of producing a steel sheet useful for
making cans, the method steps include hot rolling a slab, coiling the raw material, cold
rolling the material, continuously annealing the material and then temper rolling the
material.As another example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-118027
discloses a method of manufacturing a can steel plate
having good workability. This method is employed whereby
the so-called extremely-low carbon steel slab having a
predetermined composition is subjected to
