<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to detergent compositions in liquid or gel form. The compositions comprise 5-50 %wt by weight of a non-soap detergent, which is preferably a mixture of a betaine and at least one of SLES and isetionate, 0.01-15 %wt of a cationic polymer and 0.5-15 % of a silicone. The compositions are characterised by a rod-micellar structure which provides a viscosity of at least 6000 centipoise at a shear rate of 10/sec. This rod-micellar structure can be generated by the presence of electrolyte or perfume in the compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detergent compositions in liquid
or gel form suitable for personal washing and having a
specified minimum viscosity.There are a variety of commercially available detergent
products in liquid form which are intended for personal
washing. Shampoos intended for hair washing are
customarily formulated so as to have a viscosity which
does not substantially exceed 5,000 centipoise at a shear
rate of 10 sec-1. This enables such compositions to be
worked into the hair of the user without undue difficulty.By contrast some products intended for washing skin are
formulated with a rather higher viscosity so that they
will not run off too quickly when applied to the skin of
the user. Shower gels are a typical form of detergent
product frequently formulated to have relatively high
viscosity.It is known to include silicone in shampoo compositions as
a hair conditioning aid. A difficulty however is that the
emulsified droplets of silicone oil tend to come out of
suspension and form a separate layer at the top of the
liquid phase. It is known to include cationic polymer in
shampoo compositions together with the silicone oil. The
cationic polymer acts as another conditioning aid.
Nevertheless in order to obtain a shampoo composition
which is stable on storage some additional measure is
necessary. One possibility is to include a diester of a
dihydric alcohol such as ethyleneglycol distearate which
functions to structure the emulsion and inhibit the
separation of silicone oil. Another approach is to
incorporate compounds which are secondary alcohols having
2 alkyl chains extending from a central moiety which 
includes the secondary hydroxyl group.These secondary alcohols and the diesters can be classified
as compounds which incorporate 2 alkyl groups with a total
of at least 20 carbon atoms between them. Other materials
which have been proposed for this purpose are acyl
derivatives in which the acyl groups contain at least 16
carbon atoms, amine oxide with alkyl chains of at least 16
carbon atoms, and Scleroglucan gums.Specific compositions of the general type described above
are found in EP-A-432951 (Unilever:1989). EP-A-432951
describes shampoo formulations comprising sodium lauryl
ether sulphate and betaine surfactants, Jaguar cationic
polymer and a silicone conditioner.We have now found that when a detergent composition
containing silicone and cationic polymer is formulated with
a higher viscosity than is customary for a shampoo, the
storage stability improves very remarkably and effectively
