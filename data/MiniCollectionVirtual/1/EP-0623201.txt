<DESCRIPTION>
This report describes a stove with automatic control, 
more specifically an automatic and intelligent stove, 
providing the equipment a more practical, secure, 
rational and efficient use. People know that standard stoves present basically a 
burner set linked to a gas conducter network and also a 
flame driver operated by electric flash. Actually, technological improvements have been very 
simple and inefficient in terms of its specific 
function, that is, heating food. All the technological improvements applied to stoves, 
besides short, limits to the starting operation and not 
specifically to heat the conditioner containers of 
food. Even the most technologically advanced stove still 
presents inopportunities in terms of safety, economy 
and operational rationalization, and do not guarantee 
the sensorial aspects (smell, visual, texture, color, 
taste) and food nourishment value. The idea to use a computer to automate the procedures 
of food preparation was conceived by J. Carl Goodhouse 
in the patent number US-A-3889,875 on 17th of June, 1975, 
which set up automatically the cooking time in terms of 
weight, cooking degree (well done, medium, rare) and a 
constant for each meat type, always considering a fixed 
cooking temperature.  
 One aspect of the current invention is to supply the 
stove with an automatic control that brings high 
security to the user avoiding gas exhaust, improper 
operation or the burning of food during its 
preparation. Another aspect of the current invention is to supply 
the stove with an automatic control that limits its use 
to qualified person, avoiding non-authorized ones, as 
children for instance, operate any of the stove 
functions. One more aspect of this invention is to supply the 
stove with an automatic programming control, allowing a 
rational, fast and ordered use of the equipment. 
The aspects mentioned above and others besides the 
benefits of this invention will be obtained with the 
stove supply fit with an automatic control, which is 
the basic flame operating system, by resting a pan over 
the oven or burner grid, works together with support 
subsystems sequence integrated to a basic system that 
warns all the stove operational variants (temperature, 
time, dehydration degree, vapour percentage and food or 
ingredients weight), and the support subsystems 
arranged by: flame sensor system; timer; a checking 
"weight" system of food to be prepared; a nearness 
sensor system and an identifier of utensils and person  
 
authorized to operate the stove; a
