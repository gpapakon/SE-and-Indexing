<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises novel oral rapamycin formulations which have, 
per 100 ml of formulation, from about 0.05 to about 10.0 grams of rapamycin, from 

about 0.1 to about 25 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide, from about 0.1 to about 10 ml of 
surfactant, and from about 65 to about 99.8 ml of PEG 400.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to formulations containing rapamycin, or 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of rapamycin, which are useful in oral administrations 
for inducing immunosuppression and for treating transplantation rejection, host vs. 
graft disease, autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation, solid tumors, fungal 
infections, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas and hyperproliferative vascular disorders. Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus 
which was discovered first for its properties as an antifungal agent. It adversely affects 
the growth of fungi such as Candida albicans and Microsporum gypseum. Rapamycin, 
its preparation and its antibiotic activity were described in U.S. Patent No. 3,929,992, 
issued December 30, 1975 to Surendra Sehgal et al. In 1977 Martel, R. R. et al. 
reported on immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin against experimental allergic 
encephalitis and adjuvant arthritis in the Canadian Journal of Physiological 
Pharmacology, 55, 48-51 (1977). In 1989, Calne, R. Y. et al. in Lancet, 1989, no. 2, 
p. 227 and Morris, R. E. and Meiser, B. M. in Medicinal Science Research, 1989, No. 
17, P. 609-10, separately reported on the effectiveness of rapamycin in inhibiting 
rejection in vivo in allograft transplantation. Numerous articles have followed 
describing the immunosuppressive and rejection inhibiting properties of rapamycin, and 
clinical investigation has begun for the use of rapamycin in inhibiting rejection in 
transplantation in man. Rapamycin alone (U.S. Patent 4,885,171) or in combination with picibanil 
(U.S. Patent 4,401,653) has been shown to have antitumor activity. R. Martel et al. 
[Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 55, 48 (1977)] disclosed that rapamycin is effective in 
the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model, a model for multiple sclerosis; in the 
adjuvant arthritis model, a model for rheumatoid arthritis; and effectively inhibited the 
formation of IgE-like antibodies. The immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin have been disclosed in FASEB 3, 
3411 (1989). Cyclosporin A and FK-506, other macrocyclic molecules, also have 
been shown to be effective as immunosuppressive agents, therefore useful in 
preventing transplant rejection [FASEB 3, 3411 (1989); FASEB 3, 5256 (1989); R. 
Y. Calne et al., Lancet 1183 (1978); and U.S. Patent 5,100,899].  Rapamycin has also been shown to be useful in preventing or treating systemic 
lupus erythematosus [U.S. Patent 5,078,999], pulmonary inflammation [U.S. Patent 
5,080,899],
