<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a device (17) for connecting two profile parts (1, 2). The device has a first connecting part (18), which is arranged in a first anchorage groove (3) of the first profile part (1). A second connecting part (23) is provided for arrangement in a second anchorage groove (4) of the second profile part (2). The two connecting parts (18, 23) can be clamped together by means of a clamping part (24). Arranged between the two connecting parts (18, 23) is a supporting part (56), upon which the second connecting part (23) acts during the clamping movement of the clamping part (24). Due to said second connecting part acting on said supporting part, the supporting part (56) and the second connecting part (23) carry out a pivot movement relative to one another, which leads to the two parts (56, 23) being firmly clamped, such that they can be released, in the assigned second anchorage groove (4). The connecting device can be produced and handled in a simple manner and permits the profile parts to be connected without the removal of any material.

Connecting device with sections suitable for the construction
of structures such as tables, shelving, stands and the like

for connecting a first section (1) to a second section (2) extending
at right angles thereto with an end face pointing towards

a longitudinal side of the first section (1), the longitudinal
side (14) of the first section (1) facing the second section (2)

being provided with a first anchoring groove (3) extending in the
longitudinal direction, the slot-like lateral longitudinal opening

(5) of which is met by the longitudinal axis (16) of a second
anchoring groove (4) provided on the second section (2) and open

on the end face adjacent to the first section (1), with a first
connecting element (18) locatable in the first anchoring groove

(3) in an anchored position in which it is so supported on the
first section (1) that it resists removal through the slot-like

longitudinal opening (5), with a second connecting element (23)
locatable in the second anchoring groove (4) and with a clamping

element (24) acting on the two connecting elements (18, 23) and
capable of being driven to perform a clamping movement whereby

the two connecting elements (18, 23) are forced towards each
other substantially in the direction of the longitudinal axis

(16) of the second anchoring groove (4), the second connecting
element (23) being longitudinally fixed in the second anchoring

groove (4), characterized in that a support element (56) to be
located in the second anchoring groove (4) between the two connecting

elements (23) is provided, which support element (56) is
forced towards the first connecting element (18) by the second

connecting element (23) during the clamping movement of the
clamping element acting on the second connecting element (23),

being supported on the first section (1) with at least one supporting
section (57) via the open end face of the second anchoring

groove (4) while adopting a supporting position, and in that
the second connecting element (23) and the support element (56) 

are in operative connection with each other by way of a pivoting
area (63) to perform a relative pivoting movement at right angles

to the longitudinal axis (16) of the second anchoring groove (4),
thus being transversely braced in said second anchoring groove

(4) when the second connecting element (23) is increasingly forced
towards the support element (56) through the action of the

clamping element (24) in the support position of the support
element (56).
Connecting device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a deformation space (69) is provided between the second connecting

element (23) and the support element (56), said space
being bridged by a connecting section determining the pivoting

area (63) and connecting the two elements (56, 23).
Connecting device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the deformation space (69) has an inner part (74) located

immediately adjacent to the connecting section (68), where the
distance between the support element (56) and the second connecting

element (23) is greater than in the area of an outer part
(75) of the deformation space (69) following the inner part (74)

on the side opposite the connecting section (68).
Connecting device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the second connecting element (23) and the support element

(56) are integrally linked by way of the connecting section
(68) and able to perform the required pivoting movement by means

of resilience.
Connecting device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the second connecting element (23) and the support element

(56) form an integral part of a clamping element (66), in particular
a metal clamping element, with a transverse recess forming

the deformation space (69) while leaving the connecting section

(68). 
Connecting device according to any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the pivoting area (63) is located at a distance

next to the force axis (79) of the clamping element (24) forcing
the second connecting element (23) towards the support element

(56).
Connecting device according to any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the clamping element (24) is a tie-bar (34)

extending both through the second connecting element (23) and the
support element (56), the pivoting area (63) lying laterally next

to the tie-bar (34).
Connecting device according to any of Claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the support part (56) has a centring projection

(77) on the end face adjacent to the first section (1) dipping
into the slot-like longitudinal opening (5) of the first anchoring

groove (1) in the support position.
Connecting device according to any of Claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that the first connecting element (18) is a sliding

block.
