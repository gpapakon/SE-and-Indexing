<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of olefinically unsaturated isocyanates by reaction of a1) isophorone diisocyanate or of mixtures of isophorone diisocyanate with a2) other organic polyisocyanates containing b1.1) olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids or mixtures thereof with b1.2) other mono- or polybasic carboxylic acids, b2.1) olefinically unsaturated alcohols and/or b2.2) other mono- or polyhydric alcohols, the unsaturated isocyanates obtainable in this way and their use as binders for coating materials to be processed at room temperature as one component.

A method for the preparation of olefinically 
unsaturated isocyanates having an isocyanate content 

of from 4 to 20 wt.%, characterised in that 

a) an isocyanate component having an isocyanate 
content of from 20 to 51 wt.% and an (average) 

functionality of below 2.5, consisting 
substantially of 


a1) from 40 to 100 wt.% of isophorone 
diisocyanate (IPDI), 
a2) from 0 to 60 wt.% of other organic 
polyisocyanates having an isocyanate content 

of from 10 to 60 wt.% 
 
is reacted with 
b) an olefinically unsaturated reactive component 
having an (average) functionality in the 

isocyanate addition reaction of below 1.5 and an 
iodine number of above 70, consisting 

substantially of 

b1) from 1 to 100 wt.% of a carboxylic acid 
component consisting of 


b1.1) from 80 to 100 wt.% of at least one 
monobasic, olefinically unsaturated 

carboxylic acid having 10 to 22 carbon 
atoms per molecule and 
b1.2) from 0 to 20 wt.% of other monobasic or 
polybasic carboxylic acids in the  

 
molecular weight range of from 46 to 

350, and 
b2) from 0 to 99 wt.% of an alcohol component 
consisting of 


b2.1) from 0 to 100 wt.% of at least one 
monohydric olefinically unsaturated 

alcohol having 10 to 22 carbon atoms 
per molecule and 
b2.2) from 0 to 100 wt.% of other monohydric 
or polyhydric alcohols in the molecular 

weight range of from 32 to 4000, with 
the proviso that the total quantity of 

the alcohols b2.2) is at most 20 wt.%, 
referred to the total weight of 

component b), 
 
optionally in the presence of catalysts and/or other 

auxiliary substances and additives of isocyanate 
chemistry, with an equivalent ratio of isocyanate 

groups of component a) to carboxyl and optionally 
hydroxyl groups of component b) of from 4:1 to 40:1 

being maintained, and the reaction products are 
subsequently freed by distillation from excess, 

distillable starting isocyanates a1) and/or a2) to a 
residual content of such isocyanates of at most 

0.5 wt%. 
The method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
component a) consists of isophorone diisocyanate to an 

extent of at least 60 wt.%.  
 
The method according to claim 1 and 2, characterised 
in that component b) consists of carboxylic acids b1) 

to an extent of at least 80 wt.%. 
The method according to claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that component b) consists entirely of unsaturated 

carboxylic acids b1.1). 
Olefinically unsaturated isocyanates, obtainable by 
the method according to claims 1 to 4. 
Use of the olefinically unsaturated isocyanates 
obtainable according to claims 1 to 4 as binders for 

coating materials to be processed as one-component 
products at room temperature.
