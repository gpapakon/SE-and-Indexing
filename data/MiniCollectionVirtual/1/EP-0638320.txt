<ABSTRACT>
An air cleaning agent which comprises a double salt composed of at least one metal salt selected from among 
salts of nickel, aluminum, zinc and titanium and hydrazine or which comprises the double salt supported on a molding 

of chain magnesium silicate as the carrier. The production process comprises either dipping chain magnesium silicate 
in an aqueous solution of a mixture of the metal salt with hydrazine, followed by drying to support the double salt 

on the silicate, or dipping chain magnesium silicate in an aqueous solution of the metal salt and then in an aqueous 
solution of hydrazine, followed by drying to deposit the double salt on the silicate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air purification agent, and a process for producing the same, for
removing acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), formaldehyde (HCHO), trimethylamine ((CH3)3N), ammonia (NH3), and
other foul smelling or unpleasant smelling substances, from the air.Foul smelling gases in the air are treated by the adsorption method using activated carbon, the masking
method using other scents, the chemical method for effecting a chemical reaction with, for example, the
odorous substances, so as to eliminate or reduce the foul smelling or unpleasant smelling substances. The
adsorption method using activated carbon, however, has the problem of degradation of the deodorizing
capability in a short time period. Further, since the activated carbon is flammable, there is the disadvantage
of its easily becoming a causative factor in fires. In the masking method using other scents, the scents
sometimes cause new unpleasantness, and therefore, this cannot be said to be a fundamental solution to
the problem. In the chemical method for removal of the foul smelling or unpleasant smelling substances by
chemical reactions, there is known, for example, the method of oxidation and decomposition of foul smelling
gaseous substances by, for example, ozone, but excessive ozone is harmful to human health, and therefore,
there is the problem that a new type of harm is caused. That is, since it is difficult to control the amount of
the chemical substance for reacting stoichiometrically with the foul smelling gaseous substance, an
unnecessary chemical substance remains and thus this is, again, not a fundamental solution to the problem.For example, it is difficult to remove acetaldehyde, the main odorous component in cigarette smoke,
even using activated carbon. For this purpose, various measures have been taken, such as the improvement
of the removal capability by adding the highly chemically reactive aniline to activated carbon, as
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 56-53744, and removal by effecting a
chemical reaction with phenylhydrazine, as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
No. 56-95319. However, according to the discoveries of the present inventors, the foul smelling odor of the
chemically reactive substance itself becomes a problem or the maintenance of the activity of the chemical
substance is difficult and the usage life is short. Therefore, these are not fundamental solutions either.The present inventors previously invented a deodorant composition superior in
