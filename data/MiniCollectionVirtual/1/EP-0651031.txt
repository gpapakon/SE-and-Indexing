Process for the colouration of organic media with 
granulated inorganic pigments, characterised in that 

inorganic pigments are granulated in a multistage 
process with the addition of oils having a kinematic 

viscosity at 40 Â°C of 1.6 to 1500 mm
2
/s as binders to 
granulated pigments of an average particle size of 0.2 

to 2 mm without the recycling of a fines component, by 
placing the inorganic pigments together with the oils 

in a mixer, by subjecting the pigment powder thus 
pretreated to a compacting stage with line forces of 

between 0.1 and 15 kN/cm, by breaking down the flakes 
of a density of 0.5 to 3.0 g/cm
3
 formed in the course 
of this by subsequent rough grinding on a screen 

granulator into pregranulate and powder and 
completely pelletizing these by rerolling on a 

rotating pan or in a rotating drum, and by mixing the 
inorganic pigment granules with the organic media. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the organic media are plastics. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the plastics are thermoplastics, thermosetting 

plastics and/or elastomers. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the organic media are polymers with elastomeric 

properties. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the line forces amount to 0.5 to 10 kN/cm. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that iron oxide pigments, titanium  

 
dioxide pigments, chromic oxide pigments and/or rutile 

mixed-phase pigments are used as inorganic pigments. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that vegetable oils, technical or 

synthetic oils of paraffinic or naphthenic nature or 
oily compounds such as, for example, silicone oils 

(polysiloxanes) are used in an amount of 0.01 
to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 6 wt.%, most preferably 

0.3 to 4 wt.%. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1, 2, and 5 
to 7, characterised in that the granulated pigments 

are mixed with liquid synthetic materials. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1, 2, and 5 
to 7, characterised in that the granulated pigments 

are used for the production of powder coatings.
