<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new silacyclohexane compound,
a method of preparing it, and a liquid crystal composition
which contains it as well as a liquid crystal display element
which contains said liquid crystal composition.A liquid crystal display element utilizes the optical
anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances.
Display methods include the TN mode (twisted nematic mode),
the STN mode (super twisted nematic mode), the SBE mode (super
birefringence mode), the DS mode (dynamic scattering mode),
the guest-host mode, the DAP mode ("deformation of aligned
phase" mode) and the OMI mode (optical mode interference mode).
The most common display device has a twisted nematic structure
based on the Schadt-Helfrich mode.The properties required of the liquid crystal substance
used in these liquid crystal displays are somewhat different 
depending on the display method. However, a wide liquid crystal
temperature range and stability against moisture, air, light,
heat, electric fields, etc., are commonly required in all display
methods. Furthermore, it is desirable for the liquid crystal
material to have a low viscosity, and also to have a short
address time, low threshold voltage and high contrast in the
cell(s).Currently, there is no single compound which satisfies
all these requirements. In practice, liquid crystal mixtures
are obtained by mixing several to more than ten liquid crystal
compounds and latent liquid crystal compounds. Because of
this, it is also important that components of a liquid crystal
composition mix easily.The components of the liquid crystal mixture described
above can be classified into several categories based on their
functions, as shown below:
1) Compounds which contribute to a reduction in viscosity
and a lowering of the melting point of the mixed liquid crystal
composition2) Compounds which mainly control the electro-optical functions
of the mixed liquid crystal composition 3) Compounds which contribute to raising the clearing point
of the mixed liquid crystal composition4) Compounds which contribute to refraction anisotropy control
of the mixed liquid crystal composition 5) Compounds which control the colored display and orientation
of the mixed liquid crystal compositionFor compounds which belong to the category "1) Compounds
which contribute to a reduction in viscosity and a lowering
of the melting point of the mixed liquid crystal composition"
in this classification, compounds with a so-called EPCH structure
such as
