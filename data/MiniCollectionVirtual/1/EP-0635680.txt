valves for feeding a pilot flame nozzle (16), a pilot 
flame detecting thermocouple (12) for powering said 

magnetic assembly (11) and holding said first safety 
valve (5) open in the presence of the pilot flame and a 

thermopile (21) for powering an electromagnetic device 
(20) driving said second valve (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
flame-safeguarded thermostatically regulated gas burner 
actuator. It is known that increasingly stricter safety 
requirements are being enforced on gas-burning heaters, 
such as household ovens, boilers, and the like, 
especially in connection with the use of inflammable 
(air/methane) mixtures having a high available heat 
value and high rate of flame propagation, and hence a 
high potential for blasting. Thus, the actuators are provided with 
protections, and comprise two cascaded shutoff valves, 
a first safety valve being preferably controlled, but 
not limited thereto, by a pilot flame detector, which 
flame is to be constantly lit, a second regulator valve 
being controlled by a thermostatic device which 
generally applies a regulation of the on/off type by 
opening and closing electric contacts which allow an 
electromagnet driver for the regulator valve to be 
energized intermittently. The "off" response of the safety valve, in 
the event of the pilot flame being extinguished, should 
be specially fast. A further requirement of the actuators is a  
 
capability for self-supported operation, whereby they 
can operate without requiring an external power source. Known are twin shutoff valve actuators 
wherein a first safety valve is driven by an 
electromagnetic assembly powered from a thermocouple 
heated by the pilot flame. The assembly is set manually, whereupon the 
safety valve is opened and gas is admitted to the 
nozzle of the pilot flame, which may be lighted using 
piezoelectric spark-making devices or another 
equivalent means. The safety valve is then held open by the 
current flowing through the electromagnetic winding on 
account of the thermoelectric electromotive force 
generated by the thermocouple. Retention of the open state is ensured a few 
seconds after the pilot flame is ignited, as necessary 
to heat up the thermocouple and its protective case 
which have low thermal inertia. In the event of the pilot flame going off, 
and the thermocouple being cooled the thermocouple 
current decreases rapidly and is no longer able to 
oppose the force exerted by a bias spring of the 
electromagnetic assembly and for closing the safety 
valve, which is therefore promptly shut off.  The mechanical power for setting and loading 
the spring is supplied by the operator and to retain 
the open condition the small power, on the order of few 
milliwatts, provided by the thermocouple is sufficient, 
since no work is involved. Quite different is the situation
