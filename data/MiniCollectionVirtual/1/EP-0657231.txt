<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an apparatus A for 
bending a band plate (100), such as a band edge, in 

which a fixed mold (1) having a slit (11) through 
which the band plate (100) is passed is provided 

unitarily with a shaft (3), a movable mold (2) for 
bending the band plate (100) in cooperation with 

the fixed mold (1) being cylindrically formed, a 
rotational force being transmitted from an electric 

motor (5) to one end portion only of the movable 
mold (2). The shaft (3) is fastened at its lower 

portion to a machine base (4) with bolts (85) via 
a mount member (8), whereby the changing of the 

fixed mold (1) can be done easily. In order to change 
the fixed mold (1) for another, the bolts (85) are 

removed, and the shaft (3) is drawn out along with 
the mount member (8) toward the lower side of the 

machine base (4), another shaft being inserted from 

the lower side of the machine base to fix the mount 
member to the machine base by using the bolts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for bending a strip
material which is used to bend a steel strip such as a band blade for a Thomson
blade wooden model.Conventionally, as an apparatus for bending a strip material, known
is an arrangement according to the preamble of claim 1 wherein a stationary
die having slit through which a strip material is passed is provided, and the
strip material projected from the slit is pressed by a movable die against an
outlet corner of the slit, so that the strip material is bent in one direction by a
fixed angle. Such an arrangement is for example known from EP-A-0317637.Furthermore, the inventor has developed a bending apparatus in
which a movable die is moved along an arcuate path so that a strip material
can be bent by an angle greater than a right angle by a single pressing operation of
the movable die, and the strip material can be bent in either of the rightward
and leftward directions.Fig. 8 shows a stationary die and a movable die which are used in the
bending apparatus developed by the inventor. It is to be noted that the
apparatus as shown in Fig. 8 and described in the following passages had not
been made available to the public prior to the date of the claimed priority and
does therefore not constitute prior art in the sense of Art. 54(2) EPC. Furthermore,
the apparatus does not from part of the prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC. In Fig. 8, the stationary die is designated
by reference numeral 1 and the movable die by reference
numeral 2. The stationary die 1 is integrated with a
middle portion in the axial direction of a shaft body 3,
and comprises a slit 11 through which a strip material
(not shown) is to be passed. The movable die 2 consists
of a pair of arcuate members 2a, 2a having pressing die
portions 21, 21. The arcuate members 2a, 2a are disposed
at both sides of the stationary die 1 so as to
sandwich it. During the process of bending the strip
material, the movable die 2 consisting of the pair of
arcuate members 2a, 2a is rotated about the shaft body 3
in the forward or reverse direction by a predetermined
angle, and the strip material projected from the slit 11
of the stationary die 1 is pressed against an outlet
corner 11a or 11b of the slit 11 by one of the pressing
die portions 21 of the movable die 2, whereby the strip
material is bent by a fixed angle in a predetermined
direction.In such a bending apparatus, from the view point of
improving the working accuracy, it is indispensable to
set the parallelism of the pressing die
