<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to modulated focus voltage
circuits for television apparatus.The need for focus control is well understood in the
art. It was experienced early in television apparatus as an
incident to the scanning of cathode-ray tubes because the distance
from the center of deflection to the scanned raster is not uniform.
Actually, that distance varies markedly as the beam is deflected
horizontally and vertically from the central portion of the screen
and, consequently, defocusing is most severe at the corners of the
raster. The adaption of picture tubes of increased size and wider
deflection angles in recent years has emphasized the defocusing
effect at the corners of the scanning pattern.Efforts have been made to control focus in
electrostatically focused tubes by changing the magnitude of the
focus potential with displacement of the beam from the center of
the raster. This technique is referred to as dynamic focusing. It
comprises the application of a unidirectional potential to the focus
electrode of the electrostatically focused cathode-ray tube to
establish the proper focus condition at the center of the raster and
the concurrent application of a suitable varying potential to
preserve that condition throughout the scanning raster. Since, in
the usual case, the beam focus changes approximately in
accordance with a parabolic function along either scanning
direction, the varying components of focus potential may have a
parabolic waveform in both axes.Typically, a vertical rate parabolic waveform is
produced by integrating a sawtooth waveform that is
synchronized to, for example, a vertical deflection current. Also,
multiplication can be used. Disadvantageously, both techniques
may require complex circuitry. A focus voltage generating apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is
disclosed in US-A-3 084 276. In US-A-3 796 913 a focus waveform generator for
dynamic focussing is disclosed in which an input signal is coupled to a differential
amplifier which produce a pair of output signals coupled to the inputs of two
transistors, which output signal indicate the polarity and absolute magnitude of
the input signal. The output signals of the transistor pair are shaped to
approximate a parabola by a pair of networks of parallel resistive paths. Each of
the resistive paths are selectively inserted to reduce the slope of the output
signal. The number of resistive paths determines the number of breakpoints
which can be increased or decreased to generate a desired waveshape.The present invention
