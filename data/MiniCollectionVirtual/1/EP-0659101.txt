<ABSTRACT>
An adsorption system, such as a composite dryer bed (10), having at least two distinct adsorption regions for simultaneous drying and removing metallic/inorganic and organic forms of mercury from a fluid including a container having an entrance area and an exit area; a distinct first region (11) located within the container and proximal to the entrance area of a porous substrate having elemental silver associated therewith; and a distinct second region (12) adjacent thereto of a porous substrate having elemental gold associated therewith. The first region substantially removes water and metallic forms of mercury and the second region substantially removes organic forms of mercury and residual water from the fluid. A method of removing both metallic and organic mercury simultaneously with water as well as a means for regenerating the dryer-bed are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a method for 
simultaneously removing mercury and water from fluids 
by contacting the fluids with porous adsorbent 
substrates having elemental silver resp. gold 
impregnated or coated thereon. This invention further 
relates to an adsorption reactor having at least two 
distinct adsorbing regions each of which has a porous 
substrate as the adsorbent material 
whereby the porous substrate of the first distinct 
region is mixed, coated or impregnated with elemental 
silver and the porous substrate of the second distinct 
region is mixed, coated or impregnated with elemental 
gold. It is often desirable to remove water from fluids, 
such as from hydrocarbon fluids, an example being 
natural gas. Water can be effectively removed from 
such fluids by means of molecular sieves, particularly 
the synthetic crystalline zeolite known as zeolite A. 
Zeolite A contains cavities formed by sodalite cages 
stacked in simple cubic form. These cages are made up 
of truncated octahedra having a silica or alumina 
tetrahedron at each point. The cavities are surrounded 
by eight oxygen atoms, and are partially blocked by 
cations that balance the charge on the oxygen atoms. 
In zeolite A, each alumina moiety is balanced by two 
positive charges. If the cation is sodium, the cavity 
is reduced to 4.2 x 10-7 mm (4.2 angstroms) in diameter. 
If the cation is potassium, the cavity is reduced to 3 
x 10-7 mm (3 angstroms) in diameter. If the cation is 
calcium, the cavity is reduced to 5 x 10-7mm (5 
angstroms) in diameter. Thus, zeolite A having sodium, 
potassium and calcium ions are known respectively as 
zeolite 4A, zeolite 3A and zeolite 5A. The pore 
diameters of zeolite A make them especially suitable as  
 
drying agents, since the pores are large enough to 
accommodate water molecules, but not most other 
molecules found in nature. When a zeolite used for drying fluids becomes 
saturated with water, it must be regenerated, which is 
often accomplished by heating with flowing hot gas. 
Zeolite 4A is the most commonly used molecular sieve 
for this purpose. It is also important to remove mercury from fluids 
such as natural gas, liquid condensate, oil and waste 
waters. For example, natural gas may contain as much 
as 250 ppb (micrograms/m3) mercury. Following the 
drying procedure described above, the natural gas is, 
in many commercial liquefaction operations, transported 
to aluminum heat exchangers. Mercury present in the 
natural gas causes corrosion of the aluminum and must 
therefo
