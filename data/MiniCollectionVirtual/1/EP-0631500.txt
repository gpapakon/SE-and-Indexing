<ABSTRACT>
1 alpha -Hydroxy-24-epi-vitamin D4 and novel intermediates formed in a novel method of preparing this compound. The method includes campesterol as a starting material which is converted to 24-epi-vitamin D4 which is in turn hydroxylated to 1 alpha -hydroxy-24-epi-vitamin D4 via tosylated and cyclic derivatives of 24-epi-vitamin D4. 1 alpha -Hydroxy-24-epi-vitamin D4 has been found to be bioactive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biologically active
vitamin D4 compounds. More specifically, this invention
relates to novel 1α-hydroxy-24-epi-vitamin D4 and a
method for preparing this compound as well as novel
intermediates formed in the synthesis.The vitamins D are a group of compounds that are
steroid derivatives and are known to be important in the
regulation of calcium metabolism in animals and man.
See, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine:
Part Eleven, "Disorders of Bone and Mineral Metabolism,
Chapter 335," E. Braunwald et al., (eds.), McGraw-Hill,
New York, 1987, pp. 1860-1865.The naturally occurring form of vitamin D in
animals and man is vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is synthesized
endogenously in the skin of animals and man. In
animals, including man, vitamin D3 is activated by being
hydroxylated in the C25 position in the liver, followed
by 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney to produce the hormone
1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3. See, U.S. Patent
No. 3,880,894.1α,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 is the hormonally active
form of vitamin D3. This hormone is taken up in the
intestine by specific cytoplasmic receptor proteins to
stimulate calcium and phosphate transport from the
intestinal lumen to circulation. The vitamin D3 hormone
also is taken up by specific cytoplasmic receptors in
the parathyroid glands, the kidney, the osteoblasts, and
other target tissues, to elicit cellular responses 
which, synergistically, stabilize blood levels of
calcium and phosphorus, control the formation and
removal of bone, and regulate the further production of
1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 itself. It is now recognized
that the 1α-hydroxy group is important in the binding of
1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 with its specific cytoplasmic
receptors. It has also recently been reported that the
vitamin D3 hormones may play a role in cell proliferation
and differentiation.Vitamin D2 is the major, naturally occurring form of
vitamin D found in plants. Vitamin D2 differs
structurally from vitamin D3 in that vitamin D2 has a
methyl group at C24 and has a double bond between C22 and
C23.Considerable interest has focused on discovery and
synthesis of various hydroxylated and dihydroxylated
derivatives of vitamins D3 and D2. Examples of
hydroxylated and dihydroxylated metabolites of
vitamins D3 and D2 which have been found to occur
naturally and/or have been synthesized include
25-hydroxy vitamin D2, 24, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, 25,
26-dihydroxy vitamin D3, 1α-hydroxy vitamin D2, 23,
25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, all of which have been found to
exhibit
