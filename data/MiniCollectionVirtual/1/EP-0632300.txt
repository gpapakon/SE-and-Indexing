An optical wavelength multiplexing and 
demultiplexing device includes a first waveguide and a 

plurality of waveguides having different propagation 
constants. The first waveguide is caused to be coupled 

with the plurality of waveguides in different modes. 
The plurality of waveguides have different structures or 

different indices so as to provide different propagation 

constant one another. According to the optical 
wavelength multiplexing and demultiplexing device, light 

components having various wavelengths and modes can be 
simultaneously multiplexed or demultiplexed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
wavelength multiplexing and demultiplexing device used
in optical communications and a photodetector using the
same.A directional coupler having two asymmetrical
waveguides and a grating, as described in Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2-239209 is proposed as
a conventional optical wavelength multiplexing and
demultiplexing device for multiplexing or demultiplexing
an optical signal. Advantageous features of such an
element are a pass band of about several nm,
transmission of an optical signal having a nonfiltering
wavelength, and the like. An odd mode εodd and an even
mode εeven having an electric field distribution shown in
Fig. 1 are present in the directional coupler. The
grating is used as a phase matching means for coupling
these two modes.As shown in Fig. 1, input signal light consists of
wavelengths λ1, λ2,..., λe,..., λn. When this input 
signal light is incident on a first waveguide 1 serving
as an input waveguide, it is coupled to the odd mode εodd
and propagates. However, the TE-like component of the
optical signal having the wavelength λe satisfying the
following equation with respect to a grating pitch Λ:
βoTE(λe) - βeTE(λe) = 2π/Λ
is coupled to the even mode εeven, and the optical power
shifts to a second waveguide 2 serving as a detection
waveguide. As a result, wavelength demultiplexing is
achieved to detect output signal light which is then
transferred to another functional element.In the above equation, βoTE(λe) and βeTE(λe) are
propagation constants of the odd and even modes of the
TE-like polarized components of the light wave having
the wavelength λe.The remaining wavelength and polarized components
directly pass through the input waveguide and are
transferred to the next stage.When TM-like mode light having the wavelength λm
satisfying the following equation:
βoTM(λm) - βeTM(λm) = 2π/Λ
is mixed in, this light is demultiplexed in the same
manner as described above. When an optical output is to
be detected immediately after demultiplexing, the S/N
ratio may deteriorate. It is, however, easy to set a
larger difference |λm - λe| between these two
wavelengths than the multiplexed wavelength range Δλ, 
i.e.,
λm - λe> Δλ
thus posing no practical problem.The TE- and TM-like modes (polarization) represent
modes in which the electric field vectors point in
directions parallel and perpendicular to the surface of
the substrate, respectively.According to the conventional example, however,
only a specific polarized component having a
