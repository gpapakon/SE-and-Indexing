<ABSTRACT>
Industrial truck (10) in which a steerable, motor-driven driving wheel (26) is arranged between two lateral supporting wheels (22, 24). The driving wheel (26) is pressed into engagement with the ground by spring means (38, 40) and is provided with a guide (42, 44), with which a holder (28) for the driving wheel (26) is guided linearly and vertically in the frame (12) of the truck (10), and a linear guide (46) lying outside the drive steering axis (60) and preferably designed as a roller- or ball-circulation unit or as a rolling-element flat guide.
