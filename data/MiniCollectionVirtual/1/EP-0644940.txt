<ABSTRACT>
The enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic naproxen esters by ester hydrolases using hydrolases derived from a panel of microorganisms is described, the most suitable of which was the microorganism Zopfiella latipes. The ester hydrolases are of use in a low cost, high yield hydrolysis of racemic naproxen esters.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENZYMATIC PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OP (S)-6-METHOIY-α-METHYIi-2-NAPHTHALENEACETIC ACIDField of the Invention This invention relates to the preparation of (S)-δ-methoxy-α-methyl- 2-naphthaleneacetic acid by the enantiσβelective hydrolysis of racemic esters using microorganisms and enzymes derived therefrom.Background of the Invention 6-Methoxy-α-methyl-2-napthaleneacetic acid, which has the following structural formula:is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,904,682. It has a center of asymmetry at the α-carbon (indicated by the asterisk), and thus possesses two enantiomers.It is known that the S-enantiomer, (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl- 2-naphthaleneacetic acid, has 28-fold greater anti-inflammatory activity than the corresponding A-enantiomer (I.T. Harrison, et al . , J. Med. Chem. , 13 : 203 (1970)); and the S-enantiomer alone is marketed as the anti-inflammatory drug Naprosyn* (Barnhart, et al . , Physician 's Desk Reference, 44:2200 (1990))."Naproxen" is the USAN and INN nonproprietary name for (S)- 6-methoxy- -methyl-2-napththaleneacetic acid. For convenience, however, in this application the terms "naproxen" and "A,S-naproxen" mean a mixture of the A- and S-enantiomers of 6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-napththaleneacetic acid, especially a racemic mixture; and "A-naproxen" and "S-naproxen" mean the two enantiomers individually. Thus, the term "S-naproxen" used in this application corresponds to the USAN/INN name "naproxen". Further, for convenience in this application, although naproxen is an acid, the terms "naproxen", "A,S-naproxen", "A-naproxen", and "S-naproxen" include not only the acid form of the compound, but also the anion form and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the acid form, unless the context requires otherwise.The chemical synthesis of 6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid typically leads to a racemic mixture of the A- and S-enantiomers 

( ,S-naproxen), which must be resolved to obtain the desired S-naproxen from the racemic mixture. A number of microorganisms, as well as a few selected commercial lipases and esterases, belonging to the genera Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter , Hucor and Streptomyces have been reported to hydrolyze racemic mixtures of A, -naproxen esters with some chiral preference. The actual application of these microorganisms or enzymes in S-naproxen manufacturing, however, has been made impractical by their lack of sufficient chiral specificity and relatively low rates of conversion of A,S-naproxen ester into
