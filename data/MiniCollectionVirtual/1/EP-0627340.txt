is provided including a seat bun frame (3) having fore 

and aft ends (5,9), a seatback frame (2) joined to the 
seat bun frame (3) adjacent the aft end (9) of the 

seat bun frame (3), and a headrest cushion (6) 
pivotally attached to the seatback frame (2) along a

said headrest cushion (6) being provided with impact 
means (10) responsive to the body weight of an 

occupant of the vehicle seat whereby, upon a rear

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is that 
of seat headrest arrangements and methods of 
utilisation thereof. The present invention relates in 
particular to a vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
as specified in the preamble of claim 1, for example 
as disclosed in DE-A-2 206 329. Headrests are known in the vehicle seating 
art. Examples of vehicle seat headrests can be found 
by review of US-A-4,822,102 (Duvenkamp), 
US-A-4,762,367 (Denton), and US-A-3 655 241. The present invention provides a vehicle 
seat headrest arrangement which provides an 
alternative to the aforementioned patents with special 
unique advantages to be explained hereinafter. A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
according to the present invention is characterised by 
the features specified in the characterising portion 
of claim 1. The invention and how it may be performed 
are hereinafter particularly described with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a 
preferred embodiment of a vehicle seat headrest 
arrangement according to the present invention; Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the headrest 
shown in Figure 1, with portions of a seatback cushion 
removed for clarity of illustration; Figure 3 is a side view illustrating the 
operation of the headrest shown in Figure 2; Figure 4 is a perspective view of an 
alternative preferred embodiment of the present 
invention; and Figure 5 is a side view illustrating the 
operation of the headrest shown in Figure 4. Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle seat 
and headrest arrangement 7 according to the present 
invention has a seat bun frame 3. The seat bun frame 
3 has a fore end 5 and an aft end 9 generally 
positionally aligned with fore and aft segments of a 
vehicle in which the seat and headrest arrangement 7 
is placed. Joined to the seat bun frame 3 generally 
adjacent its aft end 9 is a seatback frame 2. The 
seatback frame 2 is generally in the shape of an 
inverted U having two sides 22 joined by a cross-frame 
member 4. Typically, the seat bun frame 3 and seat 
back frame 2 will be made from steel or other 
structural metallic members. Providing a surface for contact with the 
head of a vehicle seat occupant is a headrest cushion 
6. The headrest cushion 6 has extending therefrom two 
posts 8. An impact target plate 10 is pivotally 
mounted to the cross-frame member 4 along a fixed 
pivotal axis 13 extending generally perpendicular to 
the fore and aft direction of the vehicle. The plate 
10 has two formed alignment

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement comprising a seat 
bun frame (3) having fore and aft ends (5,9); a seatback frame (2) having two 

sides (22) joined to the seat bun frame (3) adjacent the aft end (9) of the seat 
bun frame (3); a headrest cushion (6) pivotally attached to the seatback frame 

(2) along a pivotal axis extending substantially perpendicular to the fore and 
aft ends (5,9) of the seat bun frame (2); and impact means (10,34) joined to 

the headrest cushion and responsive to movement by an occupant of the 
vehicle seat; characterised in that the impact means (10,34) is located on the 

opposite side of the pivot axis to the headrest cushion (6) and between the 
sides (22) of the seatback frame (2), whereby, upon a rear vehicle impact, the 

torso of the vehicle seat occupant moves the impact means in a rearward 
direction thereby moving the headrest cushion (6) in a forward direction 

towards the head of the vehicle seat occupant.  
 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 1, in which the headrest 

cushion (6) is separated from the seatback frame (2) 
by at least one post (8,30). 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 2, in which the post (8) is 

positionably held by a clamp (14,16) having a 
generally fixed pivotal axis (13) with a cross-frame 

member (4) of the seatback frame (2). 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which a 

spring (18) operatively associated with the seatback 
frame (2) biases the headrest cushion (6) against 

pivotal movement. 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 4, in which the spring (18) 

elastically biases the headrest cushion (6) against 
pivotal movement up to a predetermined limit and 

thereafter plastically deforms.  
 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 2, in which the impact means 

comprises an impact plate (34) operatively associated 
with the post (30) and at least one cam guide member 

(46) wherein a force exerted upon the impact plate 
(34) causes the headrest cushion (6) to rotate 

forwardly relative to the seatback frame (2). 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 6, in which the seatback frame 

(2) has a cross-frame member (4) and the post (30) has 
a pivotal axis with respect to the cross-frame member 

(4) which is non-fixed with respect to the post (30) 
upon impact of the vehicle seat occupant upon the 

impact plate (34), causing the headrest cushion (6) to 
pivot forwardly and extend upwardly relative to the 

seatback frame (2). 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 1, in which the headrest 

cushion (6) effectively extends upwardly relative to 
the seatback frame (2) upon its pivotal movement 

toward the head of the seat occupant. 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 8, in which the headrest 

cushion (6) is connected with a post, and the headrest 
cushion (6) extends rearwardly of the pivotal axis of 

the headrest cushion (6). 
A vehicle seat and headrest arrangement 
(7) according to claim 1, in which the impact means 

comprises a target plate (10) pivotally mounted to the 
seatback frame (2) along a pivotal axis (13) generally 

perpendicular to the fore and aft ends (5,9) 
underneath the headrest cushion (6) and operatively 

associated with the headrest cushion (6) so that 
rearward loading of the target plate (10) causes the  

 
headrest cushion (6) to pivot forwardly relative to 

the seatback frame (2).
