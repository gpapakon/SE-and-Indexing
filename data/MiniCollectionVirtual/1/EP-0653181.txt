<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (30) for determining a physical condition in a 
living being by determining peripheral resistance to flow is 

described. Peripheral resistance to flow is determined by 
measuring changes in the pressure drop characteristic in an 

artery during diastole. The pressure drop characteristic can be 
determined by measuring absolute pressure, relative pressure or 

dimensional changes in the artery during diastole. The apparatus 
(30) can advantageously be used in a rate-responsive heart 

stimulator (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rate-responsive heart stimulator for sensing a
physical condition in a living being, comprising a sensor for
acquiring a measurement signal related to blood pressure in the
living being."Physical condition" refers to both the general state of health
and the workload, i.e. whether the person is at rest or under
slight or heavy physical strain.For people with various pathological heart conditions or
functional defects in different tissues, the heart in particular,
indications of the patient's state of health is desirable
information. It is also desirable to have the ability to
stimulate the function of the heart of patients with heart
problems, so the function of a healthy heart is simulated as
accurately as possible.Blood pressure is a parameter which reflects a person's state of
health and which can also be utilized for controlling a heart
stimulator's stimulation of a heart.In EP-A-0 178 528 is described a heart stimulator which can
stimulate a heart at a variable rate according to systolic peak
pressure or its time derivative. Here, a pressure sensor is
placed in the right ventricle to measure blood pressure. Systolic
pressure increases when the patient's level of physical activity
increases, and an appropriate stimulation rate can be set
according to the peak value or the time derivative of pressure.However, systolic pressure is a heart parameter which does not 
solely depend on the patient's degree of physical exertion but is
also affected by other factors, such as stress, body position
etc. In addition, there are natural variations in the systolic
pressure of patients. So this all means that systolic pressure is
not a particular appropriate parameter for use in attaining the
most natural variation in stimulation rate possible.One object of the invention is to achieve a heart stimulator for
sensing a physical condition related to blood pressure in a way
which avoids the aforesaid problems.Another object of the invention is to achieve a rate-responsive
heart stimulator which stimulates the heart at the most natural
rate possible.The first object is achieved in accordance with the invention in
that the heart stimulator comprises an analyzer for determining
peripheral resistance to flow in the living being by determining
a pressure drop characteristic for the drop in blood pressure in
an artery during diastole on the basis of the measurement signal, the
analyzer also comprising a timer for determining said pressure drop characteristic in the
blood pressure.Peripheral
