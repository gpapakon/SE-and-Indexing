<ABSTRACT>
A fabric having both a high degree of user comfort and a high degree of Ultraviolet Radiation protection is provided. The preferred yarn is at least 40 Denier by 40 Denier, preferably 70 Denier by 2 \ 70 Denier Nylon Yarn. The yarn is woven into a fabric with a yarn count of at least 80 by 50, preferably about 118 by 68 yarns per inch. The fabric is sanded, preferably moderate to heavy, on one side. The fabric is jet treated, preferably air jet laundered. The fabric provides an Ultraviolet sun protection factor of at least about 30, preferably about 70 or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fabric for providing
protection against Ultraviolet Radiation and, in particular,
woven fabric which provides a high degree of wearer-comfort while
providing a high Ultraviolet sun protective factor.With the increasing awareness of dangers posed to human
health by over-exposure to solar radiation and, particularly,
Ultraviolet components of radiation, a number of attempts have
been made to provide protection from such radiation while
permitting outdoor activities. Among the protective measures
available are various types of clothing. The degree of
protection against Ultraviolet Radiation afforded by clothing is
highly variable and depends on a number of factors. Among these
factors is the Ultraviolet characteristics of the yarn or fiber
of the fabric and the type of weave of the fabric. The
characteristics of the weave of the fabric which are of interest
include the ratio of the surface area which is occupied by the
fibers or yarns to the area of the apertures between the yarns.
The principal determinates of this ratio are the tightness of
weave (typically measured as the finished yarn count (FYC) or
yarns per inch) and the thread size (typically expressed as a
Denier number). The characteristics of the yarn which are of
principal interest are the transmission characteristics of the
yarn or fiber, particularly the percent of Ultraviolet Radiation
which is transmitted through or along the fiber or yarn, as
opposed to being absorbed or reflected.In attempting to provide radiation protection, one
approach to dealing with the ratio of threads to apertures is to
provide a fabric having a relatively tight weave, or a very high
thread count. Another approach involves coating the fabric.
Both of these approaches greatly reduce or eliminate the
apertures in the fabric. While this may increase Ultraviolet 
protection, it results in a fabric which is
uncomfortable. It is believed that the lack of
comfort arises from the reduction or elimination of
the apertures in a fashion which makes it impossible
for the fabric to "breathe". This is an undesirable
approach for achieving Ultraviolet protection since it
discourages users from wearing the fabric particularly
during hot weather when exposure to Ultraviolet
Radiation is most likely. Accordingly, there is need
for a sun-protective fabric, and particularly an
Ultraviolet protective fabric which is also
comfortable, particularly in warm weather.US-A-4331724 discloses a polyester textile
material which simulates the feel, opacity, bulk

A method for fabricating a fabric
comprising:


providing a warp yarn having a yarn size of
at least about 40 denier;
providing fill yarn having a yarn size of at
least about 40 denier;
weaving said warp yarn and said fill yarn to
provide a fabric with a finished yarn count of at

least about 32 yarns per cm (80 yarns per inch) of
said warp yarn and at least about 20 yarns per cm (50

yarns per inch) of said fill yarn, said fabric having
first and second surfaces;
sanding at least said first side of said
fabric causing fill yarns on said side of the fabric

to break to provide a fabric having a sun protective
factor of at least about 30; and
dyeing and jet laundering said fabric,
following sanding.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said jet laundering of said fabric is not followed by

a step of substantial stretching of the fabric.
A method, as claimed in claim 2, further
comprising drying, after said step of jet laundering.
A method, as claimed in claim 3, further
comprising collecting said fabric in a collection bin

after said step of jet laundering and before said step
of drying, and without a step of stretching said

fabric following said step of jet treating.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said yarn comprises nylon.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said yarn has a nominal yarn size of about 70 denier.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said fabric has a finished yarn count of about 47

yarns per cm (118 yarns per inch) of said warp yarn.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said fabric has a finished yarn count of about 27

yarns per cm (68 yarns per inch) of said fill yarn.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said step of sanding comprises sanding only one side

of said fabric.
A method, as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said fabric is provided with a sun protective factor

of at least about 50.
A method of producing a fabric comprising:

providing a plurality of multi-filament
nylon warp yarns having a yarn size of about 70

denier;
providing a plurality of multi-filament
nylon fill yarns having a yarn size of about 70

denier;
weaving said warp yarns and said fill yarns
in a 1 x 2 pattern to provide a fabric with a finished

yarn count of about 47 yarns per cm (118 yarns per
inch) of said warp yarns and about 27 yarns per cm (68

yarns per inch) of said fill yarns to provide a fabric
with a weight of about 0.10 kg/m
2
 (3 ounces per square
yard), said fabric having first and second surfaces; 
sanding only said first surface of said
fabric to cause fill yarns thereon to break;
dyeing and air jet laundering said fabric,
following said step of sanding;
collecting said fabric in a collection
region;
air-drying said fabric, in the absence of
stretching said fabric after said jet laundering to

provide a fabric having a sun protective factor of at
least about 30.
A fabric providing comfort and solar
radiation protection comprising:


a plurality of warp yarns having a yarn size
of at least about 40 denier, woven with a plurality of

fill yarns having a yarn size of at least about 40
denier to provide a fabric with a finished yarn count

of at least about 32 yarns per cm (80 yarns per inch)
in the warp direction and at least about 20 yarns per

cm (50 yarns per inch) in the fill direction, said
fabric having first and second surfaces, said yarns

defining apertures therebetween;
fill yarns on said first surface of the fabric
being broken by sanding said surface;
and a plurality of fibres of said yarns on at
least said 
first
 surface 
being
 aligned with said
apertures at least partially to prevent ultraviolet

radiation transmission through said apertures to
produce a sun protection factor of at least about 30,

while permitting free flow of air through said
apertures.
A garment formed from a fabric as claimed in
claim 12.
A garment as claimed in claim 13, wherein in
the fabric is sanded on one side only.
A garment as claimed in claim 14, wherein
the sanded side of the garment is on the outside of

the garment.
