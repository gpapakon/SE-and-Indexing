<ABSTRACT>
The invention can be used to convert into electric control signals in a highly reliable way items of motor information which succeed one another rapidly or are present in a successive fashion. For this purpose, a bar magnet (2) which is connected to a tongue-receiving piece (1) is centred via a multifunctional rubber ring (4) and mounted in a defined position in a hollow cylindrical housing (6). A multiplicity of Hall elements (7) are arranged in a sealed region of the hollow cylindrical housing, in order to detect an analogue Hall voltage in accordance with the movement of the bar magnet, which is moved via the tongue-receiving piece with the aid of tongue movement. It is possible in this way to determine the final position of the deflection of the bar magnet and the amount and the direction of the movement directly and in a fashion analogous to the actuation performed by the tongue. The dimensions of the mouthpiece can be reduced by means of a minimum number of structural elements therein, with the result that the wearing and actuation properties are improved.
