<ABSTRACT>
A crucible capable of withstanding high temperatures and receiving materials to be melted, decomposed or generally converted while avoiding any physical or chemical interaction between the material making up the crucible and its contents. The crucible is made of a refractory material and designed to contain high temperature materials, and its inner wall comprises a coating based on a thin layer with a thickness below 10  mu m. The layer is preferably oxide-based and at least the inner wall of the crucible is advantageously made of vitreous silica.

<CLAIMS>
Crucible of refractory material intended to contain materials at high
temperatures, whereof the inner wall incorporates a coating based on a film

with a thickness less than 10 µm, characterized in that said coating is
obtained by pyrolysis and that the substance to be pyrolyzed is based on

organometallics.
Crucible according to claim 1, characterized in that the crucible has at
least one inner wall of vitreous silica.
Crucible according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the film is
based on oxide.
Crucible according to claim 3, characterized in that the film is made
from metal oxide or metals chosen from within the group including magnesium,

calcium, yttrium, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, chromium, aluminium,
tin and silicon.
Process for the production of a crucible according to claim 1, characterized
by the pyrolytic deposition, particularly within the crucible, of a

substance based on chemical elements compatible with the materials to be
contained in the crucibles, the substance to be pyrolyzed being based on

organometallics.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that the temperature of
the inner surface of the crucible is, during deposition, between 600 and

1500°C.
Process according to one of the claims 5 or 6, characterized in that the
organometallic is chosen from within the group including chelates and alkoxides

and in particular aluminium isopropylate and magnesium, yttrium, zirconium
and aluminium acetyl acetonates.
Process according to one of the claims 5 to 7, characterized in that
pyrolysis takes place with powder suspended in a gas.
Apparatus for performing the process of claim 8, characterized in that it 
comprises a powder supply system having a nozzle with an inner chamber, whose

orifice adopts the internal shape of the crucible in relative movement with
respect thereto, in that the inner chamber is supplied with organometallic

compound powder and in that the apparatus comprises crucible heating means.
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterized in that the nozzle incorporates
a pre-expansion element.
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that the pre-expansion
element is a tube having an orifice issuing into the inner chamber of the

nozzle.
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that the orifices of
the inner chamber of the nozzle and the tube are slots extending over the

entire height of the crucible.
Apparatus according to one of the claims 9 to 12, characterized in that,
upstream of the powder supply system, a dosing distributor followed by a

venturi tube introduce the powder into the gas.
Application of the crucible according to one of the claims 1 to 4 to the
melting of superalloys.
Application of the crucible according to one of the claims 1 to 4 to the
calcination and/or decomposition of powders, such as electroluminescent

substances, organic compounds such as oxalates or sulphates such as alums.
