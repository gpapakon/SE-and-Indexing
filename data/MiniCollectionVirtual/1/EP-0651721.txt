<ABSTRACT>
A re-useable aerosol container (100) is disclosed. Such an aerosol container defines an aperture (114) and an inner chamber (104) for containing a fluid. The aerosol container includes an aerosol valve for dispensing fluid contained within the aerosol container. The aerosol container further defines a neck (132) surrounding the aperture and further includes a plug (134) defining a cavity that is removably insertable into the inner chamber via the aperture. The plug includes a collar (144) surrounding its cavity. The plug collar and the aerosol container neck are so relatively dimensioned and adapted as to be removably engageable in a fluid-tight manner when the plug cavity is inserted into the aerosol container inner chamber via the aerosol container aperture. The aerosol container further includes dry chemical formulation ingredients, disposed within the plug cavity (138, 140). Such dry chemical ingredients, when mixed with water, are able to produce gas, for purposes of pressurizing the fluid container chamber. The aerosol container still further includes a water-soluble membrane (146), removably affixed atop the plug cavity, for retaining the dry chemical ingredients within the plug cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RE-USEABLE AEROSOL CONTAINER Technical Field Our invention, in general, is directed to a novel, re- useable aerosol container.Background Art U.S. Pats. Nos. 4,513,884 and 4,553,685, both to Magid, are presently believed to be illustrative of current re- useable aerosol container technology. Upon our review of this particular technology, however, in view of certain consumer requests, we have come to learn that many consumers are presently seeking re-useable aerosol containers that are simpler in design as well as simpler in operation and lower in cost than what is presently available to them in the marketplace.Summary Disclosure Of Invention The present invention is directed to an improvement in a re-useable aerosol container. Such an aerosol container defines an aperture and an inner chamber for containing a fluid. The aerosol container further includes an aerosol valve for dispensing fluid contained within the aerosol container.The improvement in the re-useable aerosol container of the present invention can be summarized as follows. Our improved aerosol container, in addition to the various elements recited above, further includes a neck surrounding the aerosol container aperture. Our improved aerosol container additionally includes a plug defining at least one cavity that is removably insertable into the aerosol container inner chamber via the aerosol container aperture.The plug includes a collar surrounding the plug cavity. The plug collar and the aerosol container neck are so relatively dimensioned and adapted as to be removably engageable in a fluid-tight manner when the plug cavity is inserted into the aerosol container inner chamber via the aerosol container aperture.The improved aerosol container further includes dry chemical formulation ingredients, disposed within the plug 

cavity. Such dry chemical ingredients, when mixed with water, are able to produce gas, for purposes of pressurizing the fluid container chamber. Our improved aerosol container still further includes a water-soluble membrane, affixed atop the plug cavity, for retaining the dry chemical ingredients within the plug cavity.These and other aspects and features of our present invention are discussed below in detail.Industrial Applicability Those skilled in the art know of various dry chemical ingredients that are able to produce gas upon being combined with water.When the dry chemical formulation ingredients include sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, the novel, improved, re- useable aerosol container of our present invention

<CLAIMS>
We Claim:
1. In a container (100) defining an aperture (114) and an inner chamber (104) for containing a fluid, the container including valve means for dispensing fluid contained within the container, characterized in that: the container defines a container neck 132 surrounding the container aperture and the container further (138, 140) has; plug means 134 defining at least one plug cavity that is removably insertable into the container inner chamber 104 via the container aperture 114, the plug means 134 including a plug collar 144 surrounding the plug cavity, the plug collar
144 and the container neck 132 being so relatively dimensioned and adapted as to be removably engageable in a fluid-tight manner when the plug means 134 is inserted into the container inner chamber 104 via the container aperture
114; chemical means disposed within the plug cavity 138, 140 which, when mixed with water, is able to produce gas, for purposes of pressurizing the fluid container inner stel 104; and membrane means 146 carried by the plug means for retaining the chemical means within the plug cavity 138, 140. 2. The container of claim 1 further including foil means
(150) carried by the membrane means 146 for preventing liquid water and/or water vapor from contacting the membrane means
146.
3. The container of claim 1, wherein the plug means defines two cavities (138, 140) one of the plug cavities (140) containing the chemical means, the other of the two cavities (138) containing a dispersible formulation.
4. The container of claim 1, wherein the chemical means includes sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. 5. The container of claim 3, wherein the chemical means includes sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, and wherein the dispersible formulation includes an insecticidally-active ingredient.
