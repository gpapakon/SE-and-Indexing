<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a use of 
a specific thienotriazolodiazepine compound 
for the production of an autoimmune disease treating drug. Organ transplantation has been carried out 
extensively in recent years, with the use of immuno-suppressive 
drugs such as ciclosporin, azathioprine, 
steroidal drugs and the like in order to inhibit rejection 
reactions caused by the transplantation. However, frequent 
use of these immunosuppressive drugs causes renal toxicity or 
other serious side effects, thus bringing about problems in 
the field of medical treatment. It has been disclosed, for example, in 
Transplantation Proceedings, vol.20, no.2, supplement 1, 
pp.313 - 315 (February, 1988) that a platelet activating 
factor antagonist (PAF antagonist), which is expected to be 
used as a drug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, 
allergic diseases and the like, is effective in increasing 
immunosuppression action of ciclosporin, and in Japanese 
Patent Application Toppyo No. Hei-3-500898 that side effects 
of ciclosporin are reduced by the combined use of a 
thienotriazolodiazepine.  
 Also, it has been revealed that intercellular 
adhesion molecules are taking an important role in rejection 
reactions at the time of organ transplantation. It has been 
reported that rejection reactions accompanying organ 
transplantation were suppressed with prolonged survival of 
the grafts when antibodies specific for LFA-1 (leukocyte 
function-associated antigen-1, a molecule composed of CDlla 
(α chain) and CDl8 (β chain)) and ICAM-1 (intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1), both known as intracellular adhesion 
molecules, were administered to mice which have been 
subjected to allogenic heart transplantation (Science, 
vol.225, pp.1125 - 1127, February 28, 1992). In consequence, 
it is possible to suppress the organ transplantation-accompanying 
rejection reactions by the use of specific 
antibodies to inhibit the cell adhesion caused via the 
intercellular adhesion molecules LFA-1 and ICAM-1. In addition, great concern has been directed in 
recent years toward the development of a method for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis which is regarded as an 
considerable autoimmune disease because the disease is 
chronic by itself and progressive and entails joint function 
disorder. Though nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
steroidal drugs, immunomodulators and the like are used in 
the pharmacotherapy of articular rheumatism, it is necessary 
to develop more effective therapeutic drugs because 
nonsteroidal
