 COOKING APPARATUS, BURNER CONSTRUCTION THEREFOR ANDMETHODS OF MAKING THE SAME Technical FieldThis invention relates to a new cooking apparatus and to a new burner construction therefor as well as to new methods of making such a cooking apparatus and such a burner construction. Background ArtIt is known to provide a cooking apparatus comprising a frame means having a top surface means provided with an opening means passing therethrough, and a burner construction carried by the frame means so that the burner construction projects out of the opening means above the top surface means, the burner construction comprising a first portion that extends above the top surface means, the first portion having a chamber means therein and having a port means out of which fuel can issue from the chamber means to burn externally to the first portion above the top surface means, the burner construction comprising a second portion that extends below the top surface means and has means for interconnecting with a fuel source conduit means and for delivering fuel therefrom to the chamber means. For example, see the U. S. patent to Riehl, No. 5,002,038; the U. S. patent to Riehl, No. 5,040,970; and the U. S. patent to Kwiatek, No. 4,846,671. Disclosure of the InventionIt is one of the features of this invention to provide a new cooking apparatus wherein a burner construction thereof provides unique installation flexibility by permitting the same to have various parts thereof disposed in one 

 of a plurality of selectable rotational positions so as to simplify the inherent problems of the installation plumbing, electrical wiring and general appliance assembly. In particular, it was found according to the teachings of this invention that a burner construction can be formed of two separate portions, one of which extends above the top surface means of the cooking apparatus and the other of which extends below that top surface means and has means for interconnecting with a fuel source conduit means and for delivering fuel therefrom to the first portion so as to issue out of port means thereof to burn externally to the first portion and above the top surface means.It was further found according to the teachings of this invention that the first portion and the second portion of the burner construction can have means for interconnecting the same together in any one of a plurality of selectable rotational positions therebetween so as to select the position of the igniter assembly that is carried by the first portion relative to the
