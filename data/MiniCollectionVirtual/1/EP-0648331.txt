<ABSTRACT>
To determine a fraction of a gas mixture, especially the hydrogen fraction in the containment atmosphere of a nuclear power station, the temperature change occurring in a catalytic reaction is measured. In order to cover the largest possible range of a fraction of a mixture, according to the invention the gas mixture is rarified with a driving gas of known composition. The rarefaction is preferably performed by means of a fluid entrainment pump (28, 28').

<CLAIMS>
Method for determining a fraction of a gas 
mixture, in the containment atmosphere of a nuclear power 

station, by measuring the temperature change arising in 
a catalytic reaction, characterized in that the gas 

mixture fed to the catalyst is diluted with a motive gas 
of known composition, the dilution being effected in a 

jet pump (28, 28'). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the dilution is adjustable, pr
eferably in the ratio 
of from 1:1 to 1:10. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the motive gas used is inert gas, preferably 

nitrogen. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the motive gas contains an 

oxidizing fraction, preferably oxygen. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the motive gas contains an 

oxidizable fraction, preferably hydrogen or carbon 
monoxide. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the catalyst is heated. 
Device for implementing the method according to 
any one of Claims 1 to 6, having means (34, 34') for 

measuring the temperature change arising in a catalytic 
reaction, characterized in that there is provided, for 

diluting the gas mixture fed to the catalyst (26, 26') 
with a motive gas of known composition, a jet pump (28, 

28') which on the input side is connected to a motive gas 
line (8, 30, 30') and on the output side is connected to  

 
the catalyst (26'). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the jet pump (28) debouches directly into the 

catalyst (26), a filter (32) being connected upstream of 
the jet pump. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the jet pump (28') is disposed in an at least 

partially gas-permeable housing (50) and via an outflow 
line (48) is connected to the catalyst (26').
