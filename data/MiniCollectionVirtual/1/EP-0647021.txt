<ABSTRACT>
A transformer is in this case used which has an auxiliary winding in addition to a main winding for electrical impedance matching. The auxiliary winding results in the magnetisation current being adapted so that good electrical balancing is always provided even in the event of a serious electrical mismatch.

Circuit arrangement for matching an unbalanced line system to a balanced line
system, in which


the matching is carried out with the aid of a transformer, which is connected
between the line systems, with magnetically coupled coils,
a main winding (HPW) is present on a magnetisable core of the transformer (UE)
for electrical matching of the unbalanced line system to the balanced line system,
the main winding (HPW) consists of a two-wire line, so that a first and a second coil
(Sp 1, Sp 2) arise,
an auxiliary winding (HIW) is additionally present on the magnetisable core and
consists of a two-wire line, so that a first and a second auxiliary coil (HSP 1, HSP 2) arise

and
the main winding and auxiliary winding are arranged on the magnetisable core to
be spatially separate, characterised in that
the main winding and the auxiliary winding (HPW, HIW) each consist of twisted
two-wire lines and
each have the same winding number and
one coil end of each coil of the auxiliary winding (HIW) is connected with the
system earth (ground) and the respective other end with a respective line of the balanced

line system (2) and wherein the first coil of the main winding is connected to both the
unbalanced line system and the balanced line system.
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the magnetisable
core is constructed as a magnetisable ring core.
