<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus capable of transmitting and receiving multiplexed 
signals as serial data in such a manner that, even in a state where a continuous signal 

such as an audio digital signal is not in synchronism with another signal such as a video 
digital signal, the continuous signal can be properly reproduced on a reception side 

(20). Address data based on a word clock of another digital signal is sampled (16) on a 
transmission side in accordance with a sampling clock of the continuous signal, and the 

sampled address value is included (13) in the multiplexed signals to be thereby 
transmitted together to the reception side (20). Then on the reception side (20), a word 

clock synchronously locked to the word clock of the transmission-side another digital 
signal is reproduced (22) from the received serial data, and address data is generated 

(23) on the basis of the reproduced word clock, so that the reception-side clock of the 
continuous signal is reproduced (26) from the generated address data and the 

transmitted address value included in the multiplexed signals, whereby the continuous 
signal is reproduced (25) in accordance with the clock thus reproduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for multiplexing, for example, a digital audio
signal with a digital video signal by time division and
transmitting and/or receiving such multiplexed signals
as serial data, and more particularly, to a method and
an apparatus capable of transmitting and/or receiving
multiplexed signals even in a state where an audio
signal is not synchronized with a video signal.For transmission of a digital video signal,
there is known an exemplary system employing a serial
digital interface. According to this interface, a
digital video signal is transmitted as 1-bit serial
data. More specifically, there is proposed in the
serial digital interface a technique which utilizes that
a blanking period of the video signal is rendered vacant
due to non-transmission of horizontal and vertical sync
signals, and transmits a digital audio signal together
during such blanking period through time-base
compression and multiplexing. In U.S. Patent No. 5,199,030, there is disclosed
a method of multiplexing and transmitting a digital
video signal and a digital audio signal.The serial digital interface mentioned above has
a merit that both a digital video signal and a digital
audio signal can be transmitted via a single coaxial
cable without signal deterioration, whereby signal
connection between digital video apparatus can be
remarkably simplified.Generally, sampling clock frequencies for the
digital video signal and the digital audio signal are
different from each other. For example, the sampling
rate in the case of NTSC video signal is 14.3 MHz,
whereas the rate for the audio signal is 48 kHz.
Meanwhile the transmission clock rate for the audio
signal is generally set to be equal to that for the
digital video signal. Assuming in the above example
that each sample is composed of 10 bits, it follows that
the transmission rate is 143 Mbps. The audio data is
compressed in its time base and is multiplexed to form
data of the above transmission rate.In this case, for reproducing the digital audio
data, it is generally necessary that the sampling clock
on the transmission side and that on the reception side 
are coincident with each other. However, occurrence of
a frequency error is practically unavoidable even by the
use of quartz oscillators. For attaining synchronism
between the clocks on the transmission and reception
sides, it is customary in the prior art to adopt means
of synchronizing, on the transmission side, the sampling
clock of the audio data with the video signal
