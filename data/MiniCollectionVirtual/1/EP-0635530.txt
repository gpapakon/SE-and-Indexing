<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vinyl chloride resin 
compositions having excellent tensile strength and 
processability with remarkably improved compression set and 
a method of producing the compositions. The present 
invention also relates to molded products obtained from the 
compositions and a method of producing the products. Soft vinyl chloride resins are materials which are 
well-balanced with respect to processability, physical 
properties and price. Moreover, they can be processed into 
products having a rubber-like texture. For these reasons, 
these resins have been widely used in a variety of fields 
including automobiles, machinery, electric appliances, 
medicines and buildings. However, they have extremely high 
compression set as compared with vulcanized rubber, and 
therefore, they have poor recovery from deformation caused 
by external force. Due to this drawback, the use of these 
resins has been limited. Conventional approaches to overcome the above-described 
shortcoming include a method in which a vinyl chloride resin  
 
having a high polymerization degree is blended, or a method 
in which a partially-crosslinked vinyl chloride resin is 
blended. However, these methods provide only limited 
improvements, and products obtained by either of these 
methods still have high compression set, which requires 
further improvement. According to another known method, a crosslinked 
rubber-like material is incorporated into a partially-crosslinked 
vinyl chloride resin. A product obtained by 
this method has a compression set comparable to that of 
vulcanized rubber when the proportion of the rubber 
component is high. However, as the proportion of the vinyl 
chloride resin component becomes higher, the compression set 
of the product becomes worse. It is therefore necessary to 
use a large amount of rubber component in order to impart 
compression set comparable to that of vulcanized rubber. As 
a result, the production cost is inevitably increased, and 
the excellent properties inherent to vinyl chloride resins, 
such as high weather resistance and good surface properties 
of the products, are impaired. There is also a method in which a polyisocyanate 
compound is incorporated into a vinyl chloride resin having 
a reactive group. Japanese Patent Publication (kokoku) No. 
52-32900 discloses a method of improving compression set, in 
which a crosslinked molded product is obtained by  
 
incorporating a polyisocyanate compound serving as a 
crosslinking agent into a vinyl chloride polymer
