<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a catheter which is capable of performing both an angioplasty procedure using a dilatation balloon (40) and application of therapeutic drugs using an infusion balloon (50). The catheter according to the present invention is advantageous because it eliminates the need for removal and reinsertion of separate catheters or repositioning of the same catheter to perform the dilatation and infusion procedures. The present invention also relates to a dual dilatation balloon and infusion balloon catheter, wherein the infusion balloon (50) is capable of infusing insoluble therapeutic agents to the treatment site. This is advantageous because the insoluble agents exhibit improved tissue residence profiles and more beneficial treatment characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DUAL DILATATION BALLOON AND INFUSION BALLOON CATHETERThis is a continuation-in-part application of United States application, serial number 07/897,635 filed June 12, 19-92.BackgroundThe present invention relates to a catheter which can be sequentially used to perform angioplasty and then the administration of therapeutic agents. In particular, the present invention relates to a catheter having both dilatation and infusion balloons, wherein the infusion balloon has pores optimally sized to allow infusion of insoluble therapeutic agents.Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures typically are performed using a guiding catheter which may be percutaneously introduced into the cardiovascular system of the patient through the brachial or femoral arteries and" advanced therein until the tip thereof is properly positioned in the ostium of the afflicted artery. A guidewire and a dilatation balloon catheter are then introduced through the guiding catheter, the guidewire being disposed within an inner lumen of the balloon catheter. The guidewire and balloon are advanced until the dilatation balloon is properly located within the area of lesion to be treated. Once positioned, the dilatation balloon is inflated to a predetermined size using a radiopaque liquid, such as contrast medium, in order to radially compress the atherosclerotic plaque of the lesion against the inside of the artery wall and thereby dilate the lumen of the artery. The dilatation balloon is then deflated and the balloon catheter removed so that blood flow may be resumed through the dilated artery. 

 Another means of treating stenosed arteries is through the administration of drugs such as anticoagulants, anti- proliferatives or gene transfection reagents. These drugs are commonly delivered to the stenosed artery through an infusion catheter which includes small holes formed through the catheter wall or through the wall of a balloon formed on the catheter, so that the drug may be allowed to contact with the area of treatment over a prolonged time period.It may also be desirable to infuse therapeutic agents which have been encapsulated into insoluble particles, such as, microspheres, liposomes, viruses, viral like particles, or other insoluble or colloidal formulations which provide for more controlled release of the therapeutic agent. Such insoluble particles exhibit improved tissue residence profiles, and therefore, may provide more favorable treatment results than primarily soluble agents.Unfortunately, when balloon angioplasty is
