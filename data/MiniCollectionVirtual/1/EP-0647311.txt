Sagnac effect optical gyrometer comprising a probe constituted by 
an optical loop in the form of a planar spiral (2) produced with the 

aid of optical circuits integrated on a substrate, having light guides 
for the propagation of two light waves from a light source (20) and 

traversing the spiral in opposite directions, the two ends (10, 12) of 
the guides of the spiral being connected to means (14) for the introduction 

of two light waves in the spiral and means (16, 18) for the 
detection of each of them when they leave the spiral (2), characterized 

in that the connection between the ends (10, 12) of the light guides 
and the light source (20) and the detection means (16, 18) being brought 

about by a tricoupler (8) having three parallel, rectilinear guides integrated 
on the same substrate as the spiral and whose central guide (14) 

is connected to the light source (20) and whose two lateral guides (10, 
12) are in each case connected to a detector (16, 18), the characteristics 

of the tricoupler (8) being chosen in such a way as to produce between 
the two light waves traversing the optical loop the equivalent of a 

phase shift in the inoperative position which is as close as possible to 
π/2, in that the tricoupler is integrated on the same substrate as the 

spiral and in that the central guide (14) of the tricoupler (8) is provided, 
at its end opposite to the light source, with an absorbent structure 

(26) for checking and/or eliminating the residual guided light on 
leaving said central guide. 
Gyrometer according to claim 1, characterized in that the clearing 
(25) of the turns of the loop by one of the two ends of the guides of 

the spiral (2) is brought about, in integrated optics, by direct crossing 
of the light guides in the plane of the loop, the crossing angles of 

the different guides preferably exceeding 10°.

Gyrometer according to claim 1, characterized in that the clearing 
of the turns of the loop (2) by one of the two ends of the guides of the 

spiral takes place in the form of an upper or lower passage in the manner 
of a bridge, by superimposing two crossed, guiding structures, whereof 

the lower structure constituted by the actual spiral is optically coupled 
to the upper clearing structure by means of two couplers located on the 

entrance or exit end respectively on either side of the waveguides of the 
spiral. 
Gyrometer according to claim 6, characterized in that the two guiding 
structures are identical and the two couplers (29, 31) are single couplers. 
Gyrometer according to claim 6, characterized in that the two guiding 
structures are different and the two couplers (29, 31) incorporate gratings 

(47, 49). 
Gyrometer according to claim 1, characterized in that the light guides 
of the spiral (2) are made optically independent of one another by an 

absorbent structure located either between the guides of the spiral and on 
either side thereof, or on the complete spiral. 
Gyrometer according to any one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the light source (20) is a source having a limited coherence length. 
Gyrometer according to claim 10, characterized in that the light 
source (20) is a superradiant diode.

Gyrometer according to any one of the claims 1 to 13, characterized 
in that the light guides have, at the ends of the spiral (10, 12) and 

following the exit from the tricoupler (8), a funnel-shaped widened portion 
(72) for increasing the width of the guides of the spiral.
