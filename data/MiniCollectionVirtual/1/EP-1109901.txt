<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the novel GABAB receptor subtypes GABAB-R1c and GABAB-R2 as well as to a novel, functional GABAB receptor which comprises a heterodimer of GABAB-R1 and GABAB-R2 receptor subunits. The present invention also relates to variants of the receptors, nucleotide sequences encoding the receptors and variants thereof and novel vectors, stable cell lines, antibodies, screening methods, methods of treatment and methods of receptor production.GABA (Î³-amino-butyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) activating two distinct families of receptors; the ionotropic GABAA and GABAC receptors for fast synaptic transmissions, and the metabotropic GABAB receptors governing a slower synaptic transmission. GABAB receptors are members of the superfamily of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Activation results in signal transduction through a variety of pathways mediated principally via members of the Gi/Go family of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. GABAB receptors have been shown to inhibit N, P/Q and T-type Ca2+ channels in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (Kobrinsky et al., 1993; Menon-Johansson et al., 1993; Harayama et al., 1998) and indeed there is also some evidence for direct interactions between GABAB receptors and Ca2+ channels since Ca2+ channel ligands can modify the binding of GABAB agonists (Ohmori et al., 1990). GABAB receptor-mediated Ca2+ channel inhibition is the principle mechanism for presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Post-synaptically the major effect of GABAB receptor activation is to open potassium channels, to generate post-synaptic inhibitory potentials.Autoradiographic studies show that GABAB receptors are abundant and heterogeneously distributed throughout the CNS, with particularly high levels in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, interpeduncular nucleus, frontal cortex, olfactory nuclei and thalamic nuclei. GABAB receptors are also widespread in the globus pallidus, temporal cortex, raphe magnus and spinal cord (Bowery et al., 1987). GABAB receptors are an important therapeutic target in the CNS for conditions such as spasticity, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, pain, affective disorders and feeding. GABAB receptors are also present in the peripheral nervous system, both on sensory nerves and on parasympathetic nerves. Their ability to modulate these nerves gives them potential as targets in disorders of the lung, Gl tract and bladder (Kerr and Ong, 1995; 1996; Malcangio and Bowery,
