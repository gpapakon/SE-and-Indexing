<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a preparation of blood coagulation factor XIII without viruses, obtainable by heating an aqueous solution containing blood coagulation factor XIII with a specific activity of at least 2 U/mg of total protein, which solution contains less than 10 % of known stabilisers selected from the group consisting of sugars, polyols, amino acids, peptides and carboxylic acids, and less than 0.5 mole of ammonium sulphate per litre, with the heating being carried out for a sufficient time to inactivate infectious agents, preferably for 30 min to 100 h.

A virus-safe blood coagulation factor XIII preparation,
which is obtainable by heating an agueous solution comprising

the blood coagulation factor XIII with a specific acitivity of
at least 2 U/mg total protein, which solution contains less than

10 % of known stabilizers selected from the group of sugars,
polyols, amino acids, peptides and carboxylic acids, as well as

less than 0.5 mol of ammonium sulfate per liter, wherein heating
is effected for a period of time sufficient to inactivate

infectious agents, preferably for 30 min to 100 h.
A virus-safe blood coagulation factor XIII preparation
according to claim 1, characterised in that heating has been

effected in the presence of a tenside, preferably a non-ionic
tenside.
A virus-safe blood coagulation factor XIII preparation
according to claim 1, characterised in that the solution is

substantially free from known stabilizers.
A method of producing a virus-safe blood coagulation factor
XIII preparation, wherein infectious agents are inactivated by

heating, characterised in that an agueous solution of a factor
XIII-containing solution which contains less than 10% of known

stabilisers selected from the group of sugars, polyols, amino
acids, peptides and carboxylic acids, as well as less than 0.5

mol of ammonium sulfate per liter, and has a specific activity
of at least 2 units/mg of total protein, is heated at a

temperature of from 40 to 65°C for a period of time sufficient
to inactivate infectious agents, preferably for 30 min to 100 h.
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that
heating is effected in the presence of a tenside, preferably a

non-ionic tenside.
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that the
solution is substantially free from known stabilisers. 
A method according to any one of claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that heating is effected at a temperature and

for a period of time at which more than 50% of the biologic
activity of factor XIII is preserved.
A method according to any one of claims 4 to 7,
characterised by the following measures:


providing a factor XIII-containing COHN I-fraction,
precipitating factor XIII from the COHN I-fraction
and separating the precipitate,
short-term heating the dissolved precipitate and separating
heat-denatured fibrinogen,
heating the factor XIII-containing solution without the
addition of stabilizers at a temperature of from 40 to 60°C for

a period of time of from 30 min to 2 h.
The use of the blood coagulation factor XIII preparation
according to claim 1 for producing preparations for therapeutic

and prophylactic applications, for the production of tissue
adhesives and for diagnostic purposes.
The use of the virus-safe blood coagulation factor XIII
preparation according to claim 1 for preparing a virus-safe

tissue adhesive preparation as an addition to an already virus-inactivated
fibrinogen preparation.
