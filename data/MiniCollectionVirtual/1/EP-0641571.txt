<ABSTRACT>
The vein puncture cannula has a puncturing needle (10) with a Y-shaped attachment member (11) fastened thereon. The continuous shoulder (15) of the attachment member (11) is designed as a syringe holder for a syringe (12) which can be used as a handle during advance of the puncturing needle (10). On aspiration of the syringe (12) blood is drawn into the syringe if the vein has been encountered, so that successful puncturing is indicated. The branching-off shoulder (16) is intended for introduction of the guide wire (13) into the puncture cannula. This shoulder (16) comprises a self-closing valve means which allows the guide wire (13) to pass and seals the passage of the guide wire. This prevents blood from emerging from the introduction device after venipuncture or the risk of an air embolism.

<CLAIMS>
A venipuncture cannula for placing catheters according to the Seldinger
technique, comprising a hollow puncturing needle (10), a Y -shaped hub

member (11) rigidly mounted at the rear end of the puncturing needle
(10), the hub member having a first hub (15) extending rearward from

the puncturing needle and coaxial with the puncturing needle (10) and
a second hub (16) laterally branching obliquely rearward therefrom and

a guide wire (13), the second hub having a passage for the guide wire
(13) and a self-closing sealing device, and the first hub (15) being

designed as a syringe holder for tubelessly mounting a syringe (12)
immediately to the hub member (11),
characterized in

that
 the self-closing sealing device is a valve device (31, 32) opening
upon insertion of the guide wire (13), while enclosing the guide wire

in sealing manner, that the valve device comprises a slot valve (31) and
an elastic disk (32) with a hole successively arranged in the second

hub (16), the diameter of the hole of the disk (32) being so small that
it is widened by the guide wire (13), and that a funnel-shaped wire guiding

member (34) is located between the disk (32) with a hole and the slot
valve (31).
The venipuncture cannula of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the second
hub (16) extends under an angle of less than 35Â° to the
 first hub (15).
The venipuncture cannula of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the second
hub (16) comprises an insertion funnel (37) for the guide wire (13) located 

upstream of the valve device (31, 32) seen in the direction of insertion
of the guide wire (13).
The venipuncture cannula of one of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that

the wire guiding member (34) protrudes into a cavity of the cup-shaped
slot valve (31).
The venipuncture cannula of one of claims 1-4, 
characterized in that

another funnel-shaped wire guiding member (35) is located in the hub
(16) downstream of the slot valve (31) seen in the direction of insertion

of the guide wire (13).
