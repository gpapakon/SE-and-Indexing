<ABSTRACT>
A steering assembly (10) for turning steerable
wheels of a vehicle in response to rotation of a steering

wheel (12) includes a pinion (30). A steering
member (14) is movable axially to effect turning movement

of the steerable wheels of the vehicle. The steering
member (14) has a rack portion (34) for engagement with

the pinion (30) and an externally threaded screw
portion (38). A ball nut (140) extends around the screw

portion (38) of the steering member (14) and has an
internal thread (144). A plurality of balls (200) are

disposed between the internal thread (144) on the ball
nut (140) and an external thread (40) on the steering

member (14) for transmitting force between the ball nut
and the screw portion (38) of the steering member. An

electric motor (50) includes a rotor (132) drivingly
connected to the ball nut (140) and a stator (70). The

stator (70) when energized effects rotation of the
rotor (132) and, thereby, rotation of the ball nut (140).

The steering assembly includes a one-piece molded
plastic member (60) having a first axial portion (62)

disposed adjacent to the pinion (30), a second axial
portion (66) encapsulating and supporting the stator

core (72) and the stator windings (82), and a third axial
portion (110) supporting the ball nut (140) for rotation

with the rotor (132).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle power
assist steering system. In particular, the present
invention relates to an electric power assist steering
system which includes an electric assist motor for
applying force to a steering member, such as a rack.A known type of vehicle power assist steering system
includes a ball nut for transmitting force between a
steering member and an electric assist motor. Upon
actuation of the electric motor, the ball nut is driven
to rotate relative to the steering member. The
rotational force of the ball nut is transmitted to the
steering member to drive the steering member axially.
Axial movement of the steering member effects turning
movement of the steerable wheels of the vehicle.The housing of the assist motor is made from metal.
The metal housing weighs up to about five pounds or
more. This becomes a substantial portion of the weight
of an electric assist steering system. US-A-5 555 951 discloses an electrically operated power steering apparatus having
an electric motor for producing forces to assist in axially moving a rack shaft having
rack teeth held in mesh with a pinion mounted on an end of a steering shaft with a
steering wheel mounted thereon. The electric motor and the rack shaft are
accommodated in a housing assembly which comprise a first housing and a second
housing which are separate from and fastened to each other in an axial direction of
the rack shaft. The second housing comprises a smaller-diameter portion, a
medium-diameter portion, and a large-diameter portion which are axially
successively joined by tapered portions. The electric motor has a stator fixed to an
inner surface of the larger-diameter portion and a rotor rotatably disposed around
the rack shaft in the larger-diameter portion.It is noted, that the preamble of independent claim 1 takes reference on this
document.EP-A-0 667 279 discloses an actuator for steering rear wheels. An electric coil is
disposed on the outside while a rotor is disposed on the inside, assisting in heating
dissipation. One of the bearings which support a rotor and an electric coil are
integrally secured to a casing when a resin is molded thereon. At the same time, a
ring gear is formed by the molding of the resin. In addition, the molding operation of
the resin forms one of sun gears, integrally with a rotor. The casing is formed with a
recess or projection, thus preventing a slip of the resin member from occuring. A
first permanent magnet which is separate from a second permanent magnet used
for driving is
