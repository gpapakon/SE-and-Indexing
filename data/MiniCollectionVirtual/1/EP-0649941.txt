<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of certain N-vinyl amide polymers for use in controlling pitch in paper mill systems.The problem of pitch control in papermaking has previously been recognized. The pitch in the fibers of wood pulps
is associated with naturally occurring lignin dispersing agents. Cooking and mechanical agitation which occur during
the pulping by the sulfite process liberate pitch and these natural dispersing agents. But, as a result of the mechanical
work on the fibers, the natural dispersing agents liberated along with the pitch are inadequate to keep the pitch from
depositing on the equipment employed in beating, hydrating, refining, bleaching, and even on the wire used for forming
the sheet. Because of the tendency of the pitch to agglomerate within the pulp suspension or deposit on the surfaces
of the wire or other equipment, the pitch frequently causes the formation of spots or holes in the sheet formed or may
adhere to the wire or press rolls or drier rolls and cause tearing of the sheet. This results in the production of sheets
with numerous imperfections. Among other consequences involved are the expense of cleaning the machinery frequently
either with solvents or steam, and the loss of production during cleaning and during replacing operations caused
by breakdown of the sheet.Cationic water soluble polymers are used commercially in the paper mills as pitch control agents. The present
invention is predicated upon the discovery that certain water soluble lower alkyl N-vinyl amide polymers give colloidal
pitch particle reduction in aqueous pulps.The invention refers to the use of a specific water soluble polymer for controlling pitch deposition in pulp and papermaking systems as defined in claims 1 to 6. It comprises
adding to the pulp a specific amount of a water soluble polymer which contains at least 5 mole percent of a
lower alkyl N-vinyl amide or hydrolized lower alkyl N-vinyl amides. The lower alkyl N-vinyl amide polymers and the
hydrolized lower alkyl N-vinyl amide polymers for use in the practice of the invention have average molecular
weights within the range of between 10,000 and 500,000.The polymers used in the practice of the invention contain at least 5 mole percent of the lower alkyl N-vinyl amide.
In most instances the amount of the lower alkyl N-vinyl amide present in the polymer will be greater than 25 mole
percent. The lower alkyl group of the N-vinyl amide usually contains from one to three carbon atoms. Illustrative of the
lower alkyl N-vinyl amides that are
