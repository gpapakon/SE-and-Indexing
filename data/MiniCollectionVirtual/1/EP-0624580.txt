<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
styrylcoumarin derivative, and more specifically, it
relates to a photosensitizer comprising a
styrylaminocoumarin derivative which functions as a
photosensitizer (a sensitizing dye) for a
polymerization initiator and/or a crosslinking agent, a
photopolymerizable and/or photocrosslinkable
photosensitive composition using the photosensitizer,
and a hologram recording medium containing the
photosensitive composition as a main component.With the development of triplet sensitizers and
dye lasers, various novel coumarin compounds have been
synthesized. Above all, ketocoumarins have absorption
maximum ranging from 330 nm to 470 nm and so they have
been developed as effective triplet sensitizers
[Tetrahedron 38, p. 1211 (1982)].In consequence, nowadays, the coumarin compounds
have been widely used as the photosensitizers for
polymerization initiators such as diphenyliodonium
salts, triazine, peroxides and halogen compounds.
Above all, compounds represented by the formulae (1) to 
(3) are known as preferable photosensitizers in a
photosensitive system using an argon laser at 488 nm.
However, these dyes have absorption maximums in a
wavelength region shorter than 488 nm, and a wavelength
of 514.5 nm for the argon laser is their absorption
edges. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance their
sensitivity. In order to enhance the sensitivity of a
photosensitive material, an absorbance of the
photosensitive material is required to be increased,
and as a conventional technique for increasing the
absorbance, there has been only one method of
increasing the amount of a dye.In recent years, for the purpose of solving these
problems, it has been suggested to use a styrylcoumarin
compound represented by the following structural
formula (4) as a photosensitizer (a sensitizing dye)
[Polymer Engineering And Science, 23, p. 1022 (1983)].
However, the suggested photosensitizer is not
sufficiently suitable for exposure at 514.5 nm by the
argon laser.
EP-A-0 022 188 discloses co-initiator compositions for photopolymerization
containing 3-keto-substituted coumarins as sensitizer
components besides an activator component, wherein the
coumarins have a maximum absorption of radiation between 250 and
550 nm. The amino-substituted ketocoumarins have a variety of
structures wherein an alkenylene group is present which has one
or two double bonds.JP-A-2-279 702 discloses a photopolymerization initiator composition
comprising an aminocoumarin compound and an organic
peroxy acid ester. The
