<ABSTRACT>
A liquid foam-discharging, squeezable bottle (4) is disclosed, which 
has a twist cap (1,2) screwed onto the vessel body, the twist cap (1,2) 

being composed of an inner cap (2) amd outer cap (1). The inner cap (2) 
has formed therein two independent fluid-passing mechanisms (51,3) at 

about its central position and at a position adjacent thereto, 
respectively. One of the fluid-passing mechanism (3) is a liquid 

foam-generating mechanism comprising a pipe-shaped member having a net 
screen (31) on one end thereof, and the other (51) functions as a check 

valve. The outer cap (1) has engaged inside of the foam-discharging 
opening an adapter fully covered with a net screen (14) on one end 

locating nearer to the content of the vessel (4). This vessel (4) 
enables one to rapidly discharge a uniform, creamy liquid foam by simple 

squeezing operation and, if desired, the foam can be sprayed by using an 
adapter having a small-diameter nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a squeezable vessel for discharging liquid foam according to
the precharacterized part of claim 1. Such a vessel enables a user to conduct rapid and
repeated discharge of uniform and fine liquid foam by simple operation.Conventional vessels for retaining a liquid detergent for cleaning panes or wall
surface of bathrooms have the defect that, when applied to a perpendicular plane as
a liquid, the detergent runs downward, thus failing to exhibit its function. Therefore, it
has recently been proposed to discharge the detergent or like liquid as a foam.US-A-4 509 661 which is based on Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.
6020262 discloses a liquid foam-discharging, squeezable vessel having an air inlet
passage with a check valve and a separatedly positioned foam-generating passage,
wherein the ratio of the area of opening for outlet pipe-holding pipe joint to the cross
area of the inlet passage is limited to a particular range and wherein average size of
the air-passing pores of a porous body provided on the way of the foam-generating
passage is limited to a specific size.Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. 63-13810 discloses a similar liquid
foam-discharging, squeezable vessel wherein the foam-generating means comprises
a porous plate provided on the upstream side and a net or nonwoven fabric on the
downstream spaced from the porous plate.On the other hand, there have been known those liquid foam-discharging,
squeezable vessels which have a fine net provided in the nozzle. For example, 
Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. 57-147602 discloses a liquid foam-discharging,
squeezable vessel which has a porous cylinder within a circular cap
intended for foaming the retained liquid by introducing air and the liquid thereinto
and, in addition, a net in the nozzle. Japanese Examined Utility Model No. 57-149802
discloses a liquid foam-discharging, squeezable vessel which similarly has a
porous cylinder within a circular cap with the central portion of the porous cylinder
being excluded and a valve being provided therein which functions to prevent a liquid
content from passing therethrough from under the valve and to introduce air from
outside. When the body of the disclosed vessel is squeezed, air and a liquid content
are introduced into the porous cylinder, and the mixture is foamed upon being
ejected from the porous cylinder, the foam being made finer by a net provided in the
nozzle.However, the vessel disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.
