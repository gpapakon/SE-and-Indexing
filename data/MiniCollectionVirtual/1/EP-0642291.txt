<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker includes a diaphragm having a neck with 
an annular edge (21), a voicecoil former (14) having an 

annular edge, and a spider (10). The annular edge (21) of 
the neck and the annular edge of the voicecoil former (14) 

are connected together in an annular groove structure (11) 
in fixed relationship to the spider (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to loudspeaker
diaphragm attaching and more particularly to an improved
joint among diaphragm neck, spider and voice coil former.FR-A-2 668 018 shows a loudspeaker comprising, a
diaphragm having a neck with an annular edge which is formed
in a mould with a voice coil former having an annular edge
moulded into the annular edge of the diaphragm; and, a
spider which is secured to the diaphragm adjacent the
annular edge.The present invention is characterised in that the
annular edge of the neck and the annular edge of the voice
coil former are disposed and connected together in an
annular groove structure in fixed relationship to the
spider.In one specific form of a loudspeaker according to the
invention a loudspeaker driver basket has the motor
structure located in front of the cone with the spider
behind the motor structure resiliently supporting the rear
edge of the coil former. The voice coil is located at the
front end of the coil former. The neck joint is in a groove
in the spider.The dual shear action of the neck joint in the novel
cone/coil former/spider configuration increases the buckling
load of the coil former. The spider groove provides a large
bond area between the cone, former and spider, thus making
a stronger neck joint. In addition, the groove aids in
confining the bonding adhesive to a localized region which
improves manufacturability by preventing the adhesive from
flowing out of the desired joint. This invention also helps
provide consistent acoustic properties of the manufactured
loudspeaker drivers embodying the invention.Generally, the adhesives used to couple the dustcap to
conventional loudspeakers have variations in their
stiffness, mass and damping characteristics. These 
variations are difficult to control and therefore result in
variations in the frequency response of the loudspeakers.
The novel cone/coil former/spider configuration eliminates
the need for a dustcap and its associated adhesive joint,
yet still prevents the ingress of dust into the motor
structure and reduces variations in acoustic properties of
manufactured drivers embodying the invention.Numerous other features, objects and advantages of the
invention will become apparent from the following
specification when read in connection with the accompanying
drawings in which:
Fig. 1 is a mostly exploded view of a loudspeaker;Fig. 2 is a bottom view of a loudspeaker;Fig. 3 is a top view of a loudspeaker;Fig. 4 is a sectional view through section 4-4 of Fig.

(25) surrounding a bottom opening and a front edge

surrounding an opening;
the voice coil former (14) having front and rear edges
and having a central lumen, the voice coil former being

constructed to pass between the inner and outer walls of the
motor structure (20); 
a voice coil (15) coupled around said front annular
edge of said voice coil former (14);
the diaphragm (12) having an outer annular edge coupled
between the rearward edge of the front basket (30) and the

front edge of the rear basket (24);
the spider (10) having an outer edge coupled to the
bottom edge of the rear basket (24) and having a front face

coupled to the rear edge (21) of said voice coil former (14)
and said annular edge of the neck, the spider resiliently

supporting the voice coil former and the neck.
A loudspeaker in accordance with claim 1, wherein

the spider (10) extends over the entire expanse of the
bottom opening of the rear basket (24); and
the rear edge of the voice coil former (14) and the
annular edge (21) of the neck are coupled to the spider at

a central groove (11) disposed in the front face of the
spider.
