<ABSTRACT>
Previously disclosed methods for continuously determining the concentration of hydrogen peroxide or oxidising agents therefor in aqueous solutions are in some cases susceptible to interference and/or measure only a concentration range within narrow limits. The method according to the invention for determining the H2O2 concentration overcomes these problems; it is based on measurement of the O2 concentration both in a dilution stream to which an oxidising agent for H2O2 has previously been admixed, and in a reaction stream formed from the latter and from a sample stream, after a reaction zone using oxygen electrodes and establishing the H2O2 concentration from the measured O2 concentration and the dilution factor. The device according to the invention comprises devices for obtaining a continuous sample stream (5) and dilution stream (14), a metering device (23) for the oxidising agent, mixing devices (12 and 7) in the dilution stream and reaction stream (6), devices for measuring the O2 concentration (13 and 9) and for process control (26).
