<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coal fed power
plants, and pertains particularly to an improved control
system for a power plant having pressurized combustion or
gasification of coal for powering a gas turbine to generate
electric power.There always exists in the power generating industry a
need for more efficient power plants for converting fossil
fuels to electrical power. The most efficient commercially
available technology for power generation systems is the
combined cycle gas/steam turbine operating on premium
fuels. However, the cost and uncertainty of the
availability of premium fuels make premium fuel combined
cycle power generating plants impractical. Therefore,
there exists an even greater need for power plants capable
of efficiently handling lower grades of fuels, particularly
solid fuels, such as coal, that exist in abundance in many
regions of the world for powering gas turbines. Gas turbines can be operated from either pressurized
combustion or gasification of coal or a combination of the
the two. Thus, the pressurized combustion or gasification
of coal allows the integration of a gas turbine for
generating electrical power. One major problem of these
systems is the safe shutdown of the turbine in case of
malfunction of the turbine, such as a loss of load or
balance of the turbine.The prior art approach is to use a fast acting valve
to shutoff or partially shutoff the flow of hot gases or
fuel to the turbine, similar to shutdown systems used in
natural gas fired combined cycle plants. The purpose of
this fast acting valve is to allow rapid shutoff of the gas
flow from the pressurized gasifier and/or combustor (PG/C)
to the expander inlet in the event of loss of load on the
gas turbine's generator or other malfunction. A major
problem with this approach is that a complex and costly
fast acting, high temperature valve must be used to allow
an emergency shutdown of the system. The valve must
operate under very high temperature, must close very
quickly (on the order of less than 0.3 - 1.0 seconds), and
must be very effective and reliable. In order for the
valve to be effectively rapid or fast acting, a butterfly
valve is typically used. This valve technology is 
generally considered to have a high degree of risk. Such
fast acting butterfly valves cannot typically provide a
tight seal, so some of the gas will leak through the valve
when it is closed. This can pose two problems:
1. If too much hot gas leaks through the valve
during a shutdown, the gas turbine may continue
to accelerate,
