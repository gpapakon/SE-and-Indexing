<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lactol derivative
having cathepsin L inhibitory and bone resorption
inhibitory activities, their

production and a pharmaceutical composition for the
prophylaxis or therapy of osteoporosis which comprises
said derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof as an active ingredient.Osteoporosis is a pathologic state or disease
entity characterized by a loss of bone mass over a
certain level thereby giving rise to certain symptoms
or increasing one's risk for getting the symptoms. Its
major symptoms are spinal kyphosis and compression
fracture of the dorsolumbar vertebrae and vertebral
bodies, neck of the femur, distal end of the radius,
the rib, proximal end of the humerus, and other bones.
In bone tissues, normally bone formation and resorption
are going on at matched rates, with osteoblasts and
osteoclasts playing central roles in the formation and
resorption, respectively. However, when the balance of
bone formation and bone resorption is disrupted in
favor of resorption, a net loss of bone mass results.
Therefore, drugs capable of inhibiting bone resorption
are considered useful for the prophylaxis and therapy
of osteoporosis and several bone resorption inhibitors
such as estrogens and calcitonins have been suggested
in the treatment of osteoporosis. However, these drugs
have various deficiencies, some are restricted in the
scope of indication and/or indefinite in efficacy so
that no satisfactory responses have been clinically
obtained others can be associated with various other 
health risks. Therefore, a demand exists for a new
prophylactic/therapeutic regimen for increased bone
resorption.Recently it has become clear that cathepsin L, a
protease secreted from osteoclasts in the process of
resorption, is a major factor in the degradation of the
bone matrix protein, collagen. Therefore, it is
believed that the decomposition of bone collagen due to
resorption can be controlled by inhibiting cathepsin L
activity and that this approach is useful for the
prophylaxis and therapy of osteoporosis. Heretofore, a
few substances including leupeptin and antipain as well
as the epoxysuccinic acid derivatives disclosed in
Japanese published unexamined patent application (Kokai
tokkyo koho hei) Nos.2-304074, 2-304075 and 2-304085
are reported to have cathepsin L inhibitory activity as
one of their inhibition activities.

Moreover, EP-A-0504938 discloses di- and tripeptide derivatives which are cathepsin
L inhibitors and are suitable for the treatment of osteoporosis.Lactol
