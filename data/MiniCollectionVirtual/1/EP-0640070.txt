<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel series of styryl derivatives, to processes 
for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and 
to their use in medicine. Many hormones and neurotransmitters modulate tissue function by 
elevating intra-cellular levels of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate 
(cAMP). The cellular levels of cAMP are regulated by mechanisms which 
control synthesis and breakdown. The synthesis of cAMP is controlled by 
adenylyl cyclase which may be directly activated by agents such as 
forskolin or indirectly activated by the binding of specific agonists to cell 
surface receptors which are coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The breakdown 
of cAMP is controlled by a family of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 
isoenzymes, which also control the breakdown of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic 
monophosphate (cGMP). To date, seven members of the family have 
been described (PDE I-VII) the distribution of which varies from tissue to 
tissue. This suggests that specific inhibitors of PDE isoenzymes could 
achieve differential elevation of cAMP in different tissues, [for reviews of 
PDE distribution, structure, function and regulation, see Beavo & 
Reifsnyder (1990) TIPS, 11: 150-155 and Nicholson et al (1991) TIPS, 12: 
19-27]. There is clear evidence that elevation of cAMP in inflammatory leukocytes 
leads to inhibition of their activation. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP in 
airway smooth muscle has a spasmolytic effect. In these tissues, PDE IV 
plays a major role in the hydrolysis of cAMP. it can be expected, 
therefore, that selective inhibitors of PDE IV would have therapeutic 
effects in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, by achieving both antiinflammatory 
and bronchodilator effects. The design of PDE IV inhibitors has met with limited success to date, in 
that many of the potential PDE IV inhibitors which have been synthesised 
have lacked potency and/or have been capable of inhibiting more than one  
 
type of PDE isoenzyme in a non-selective manner. Lack of a selective 
action has been a particular problem given the widespread role of cAMP in 
vivo and what is needed are potent selective PDE IV inhibitors with an 
inhibitory action against PDE IV and little or no action against other PDE 
isoenzymes. We have now found a novel series of styryl derivatives, members of which, 
compared to known structurally similar compounds, are potent inhibitors of 
PDE IV at concentrations at which they have little or no inhibitory action on 
other PDE isoenzymes. These compounds inhibit human
