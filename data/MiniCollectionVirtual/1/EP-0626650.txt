<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to digital memories and in 
particular to devices, systems, and methods for implementing a Kanerva 
memory. A Kanerva memory system is random access memory system which 
uses long addresses, typically in the range of 100 to 10000 bits, to store and 
retrieve information. Most importantly, Kanerva memories are associative 
such that storage locations do not have to be precisely addressed. The 
address space is partitioned into a number of key addresses. A set of 
addresses within a Hamming distance of the key address (the Hamming 
distance being the number of bit positions in which two N-bit binary vectors 
differ) "activate" that key address allowing access to a storage element 
associated with that key address. The Hamming distance (or radius of 
capture) may vary from key address to key address. Each storage element 
includes a series of multibit counters or registers, each storing data as a 
signed integer typcially represented by 2-8 binary bits. One counter or 
register is provided in each element for each bit position in the data words 
being stored/retrieved. When an actual address is received by the Kanerva memory 
requesting access, a test is performed to determine which key address or 
addresses are activated. During a read operation a number of key addresses 
may be activated and a best-average value is determined for the data 
retrieved from the corresponding storage elements accessed. During a write 
to an accessed storage element, a logic 1 at a given bit position of a data word  
 
being written to the element increments the corresponding counter while a 
logic 0 at a given bit position decrements the corresponding counter. Kanerva memory systems are useful many data processing 
applications requiring associative memory, such as pattern recognition and 
pattern classification. Thus, the need has arisen for a fast, simple and 
inexpensive implementations of Kanerva memories. According to embodiments of the present invention, a memory system 
is provided which includes a processor and an active memory coupled to the 
processor. The active memory includes a first memory for storing a plurality 
of possible addresses and a second memory for storing an actual address 
received from the processor. Circuitry for identifying is provided which 
identifies at least one active address from the possible addresses stored in the 
first memory as a function of the actual address stored in the second memory. According to further embodiments of the present
