<ABSTRACT>
A battery terminal includes a main member (11) and 
ring member (12), each made from a conductive metal. A stud 

bolt (14) for cable connection projects from the main member. 
A post fitting (12a) is provided in the ring member. The ring 

member is placed on top of the main member with one end of the 
ring member supported by the main member and the other end at 

an angle floating free above the main member. This other end 
is passed over the stud bolt and the post fitting (12a) of the 

ring member is fit over the battery post (1). The battery 
cable terminals (T1, T2) are fit onto the stud bolt. When the 

nut (15) is tightened on the stud bolt (14), the terminals 
(T1, T2) are tightened against the ring member, which is at 

an angle to the battery post, and the post fitting of the ring 
member is forced down and clamped against the battery post. 

Thus, securing the battery terminal to the battery post and 
securing the cable terminals to the battery terminal can be 

simultaneously completed by a single thread tightening 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery terminal 
mounted to the battery post of a battery installed in a motor 
vehicle, and relates specifically to a battery terminal 
whereby the task of securing the battery terminal to the 
battery post and the task of securing the terminal to the 
cable connector of the battery terminal can be accomplished 
by a single thread tightening operation. In a conventional battery terminal of this type (JP-A-3-16 214), the 
task of securing the battery terminal to the battery post and 
the task of securing the cable-side connecting terminal to the 
cable connector of the battery terminal are separate tasks. As shown in Fig. 11, the battery terminal is made 
from a single metal member, and comprises a ring-shaped post 
fitting 2 of which one end is open and which is formed to fit 
over the battery post 1, clamping members 3a and 3b contiguous 
on both sides to the open ends of the post fitting 2, and a 
cable connector 4 contiguous to the closed side of the post 
fitting 2. In a stud type battery terminal of this type wherein 
a stud bolt 5 projects from the cable connector 4, the bolt  
 
holes of the terminals T1 and T2 separately crimped to the 
cables W1 and W2 connected to the battery are passed over the 
stud bolt 5 and clamped from above by a nut 6. The post fitting 2 is similarly fit over the battery 
post 1, and a nut 8 is tightened onto the bolt 7 previously 
passed through the clamping members 3a and 3b, thus closing 
the open end of the post fitting 2 contiguous to the clamping 
members 3a and 3b, and thereby clamping the post fitting 2 
securely to the battery post 1. With this conventional battery terminal, however, 
an impact wrench or similar tool is used from the side to 
clamp the battery terminal to the battery post. In most late-model 
passenger vehicles, however, the engine room is 
extremely crowded, and the proximity of other components makes 
it difficult to adequately tighten the post fitting by 
applying a horizontal force because of interference from other 
components. It is even possible for the impact wrench to 
contact the negative terminal while tightening the positive 
post fitting, possibly causing an electrical short which, in 
a worst-case scenario, could cause an engine room fire. In addition, this battery terminal design requires 
separate tasks to secure the battery terminal to the battery 
post and secure the battery cable terminal to the cable 
connector of the battery terminal. The separation of these 
tasks increases the total

cable connector portion (12b) being bent at a predetermined angle with respect 
to the post fitting portion (12a) of the ring member, said post fitting 

portion being supported on the main member (11) such that, when the nut 
(15) is tightened for clamping the cable connector portions (11b, 12b) of the 

main member (11) and the ring member (12) and the cable terminals (T1, 
T2) together, the post fitting portion (12a) of the ring member is tilted to 

clamp the battery post (1).
