<ABSTRACT>
The settler (decanter) comprises a mechanical assembly (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f and 3) which is placed in the mechanical region (M) in order to allow a settler bowl (4) and an Archimedean screw (5) which are arranged in the active region (A) to be driven in rotation about a vertical axis, in which leaktight means make it possible to decouple the mechanical assembly from the bowl (4) and from the screw (5) in order to make it possible to operate thereon without risk of contamination.

<CLAIMS>
A continuous decanter for the processing of 
nuclear products, of the type comprising an active zone 

(A) separated from a mechanical zone (M) by a load-bearing 
structure (2), characterised in that a 

mechanical assembly (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, and 3) is 
placed in the mechanical zone (M) to permit a decanter 

bowl (4) and an Archimedes' screw (5) arranged in the 
active zone (A) to be driven in rotation about a 

vertical axis and in that hermetic means consisting of 
a bore (2b) formed in the removable slab (2a) of the 

load-bearing structure (2), at least one of the 
shoulders (2d) of which slab comprises an O-ring (2f), 

whilst the decanter bowl (4) is driven in rotation by a 
shaft (4a) passing through the removable slab (2a) 

through a bore (2c), to be connected by means of a disc 
(3) to a sleeve (1f) guided axially in a frame (la) to 

cooperate with a reducer (1c) such that there is a play 
(X) between the shoulder (2d) and the disc (3) in the 

operating position to make it possible to uncouple the 
mechanical assembly from the bowl (4) and the screw (5) 

in order to be able to intervene therein without risk 
of contamination. 
A continuous decanter according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that a joint (1h) surrounds firstly 

the bore (2b) and secondly the outer wall of a bearing 
block (1e) to form a seal between the zone (M) and the 

zone (A) in the operating position. 
A decanter according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the seal between the zones (A and M) is effected 

by means of the disc (3) which comes to bear on the 
shoulder (2d) of the bore (2b) to crush the joint (2f) 

when the mechanical assembly is removed.  
 
A decanter according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the decanter bowl (4) and the Archimedes' screw 

(5) are guided axially solely in the zone (M) by means 
of rolling bearings and a bearing block (1e). 
A decanter according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that upon the dismantling of the mechanical assembly, 

the Archimedes' screw (5) comes to bear on the conical 
part of the decanter bowl (4). 
A continuous decanter according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the play (X) is zero when the 

mechanical assembly is removed. 
A continuous decanter according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the feed means (6b) is fixed to 

the vessel (6) which is integral with the load-bearing 
structure (2).
