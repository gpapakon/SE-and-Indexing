<ABSTRACT>
Compositions are disclosed containing fabric softener compound having two hydrophobic groups attached to the remainder of the compound through ester linkages (DEQA), said compositions being concentrated and containing viscosity/dispersibility modifiers which are single long chain cationic surfactants, highly ethoxylated nonionic surfactants and/or mixtures thereof. Premix mixtures of the DEQA and viscosity modifiers to lower the viscosity of the molten DEQA are disclosed. Processes for making aqueous liquid compositions from solid particulate compositions containing the DEQA and processes of softening fabrics with the compositions are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to concentrated liquid textile treatment compositions. In particular, it relates to
textile treatment compositions for use in the rinse cycle of a textile laundering operation to provide fabric softening/static
control benefits, the compositions being characterized by excellent storage stability and viscosity characteristics,
as well as biodegradability.The prior art discloses many problems associated with formulating and preparing fabric conditioning formulations.
See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,904,533, Neiditch etal. issued Sept. 9, 1975. Japanese Laid Open Publication
1,249,129, filed Oct. 4, 1989, discloses a problem with dispersing fabric softener actives containing two long hydrophobic
chains interrupted by ester linkages ("diester quaternary ammonium compounds°) and solves it by rapid mixing.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,414, Chang, issued Nov. 19, 1991, teaches and claims compositions containing mixtures of quaternary
ammonium salts containing at least one ester linkage, nonionic surfactant such as a linear alkoxylated alcohol,
and liquid carrier for improved stability and dispersibility. U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,547, Straathof et al., issued Aug. 30,
1988, claims compositions containing either diester, or monoester quaternary ammonium compounds where the nitrogen
has either one, two, or three methyl groups, stabilized by maintaining a critical low pH of from 2.5 to 4.2.U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,578, Verbruggen, issued Aug. 30, 1983 discloses hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty acid
esters, and fatty alcohols as viscosity control agents forfabric softeners (the fabric softeners are disclosed as optionally
comprising ester linkages in the hydrophobic chains). WO 89/115 22-A (DE 3,818,061-A; EP-346,634-A), with a priority
of May 27, 1988, discloses diester quaternary ammonium fabric softener components plus a fatty acid. European Pat.
No. 243,735 discloses sorbitan esters plus diester quaternary ammonium compounds to improve dispersions of concentrated
softener compositions.The art also teaches compounds that alter the structure of diester quaternary ammonium compounds by
substituting, e.g., a hydroxy ethyl for a methyl group or a polyalkoxy group for the alkoxy group in the two hydrophobic
chains. Specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 3,915,867, Kang et al., issued Oct. 28, 1975, discloses the substitution of a hydroxyethyl
group for a methyl group. A softener material with specific cis/trans content in the long hydrophobic groups is
disclosed in Jap. Pat. Appln. 63-194316, filed Nov. 21, 1988.
