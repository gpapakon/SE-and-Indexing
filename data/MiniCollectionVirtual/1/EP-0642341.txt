<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to use of inhibitors
of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in treating
cancer. More specifically the invention relates to use of
lovastatin and its homologues or analogues to treat human
adenocarcinoma and selected sarcomas.Metastatic prostate cancer and stomach cancer are
refractory to all available cytotoxic agents. There is no
curative medical therapy for these common adult carcinomas.
Lovastatin, widely used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia,
is generally believed to be useful for synchronizing tumor
cell growth in one cell cycle phase. Although there exist
scattered reports of the cytotoxic activity of lovastatin, it
has not been pursued as an anticancer drug.Adenocarcinoma is a group in the histological
classification of cancer. For instance, 95% of prostate
carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Cancers of the stomach,
intestine and colon are almost always adenocarcinomas, as are
gall bladder cancers. Breast cancer is also an adenocarcinoma
in perhaps 90% of the cases. Cancer of the esophagus is
adenocarcinoma in about 10%-15% of cases and adenocarcinoma of
the lung represents about 30% of pulmonary cancers.One of the challenges in treating cancer is the
ability to follow the course of the disease and the efficacy
of therapy with some objective marker. Ideally, the marker
would be obtainable by either noninvasive or minimally
invasive means such as a blood test. The marker may be useful
in diagnosing a type of cancer as well as in evaluating the
prescribed therapy.An example of a tumor marker is prostate specific
antigen (PSA). Serum PSA is clinically useful to monitor the 
therapeutic response of prostatic cancer patients. See Hudson
et al., Clinical Use of Prostate Specific Antigen in Patients
With Prostate Cancer, Journal of Urology 142:1011-1017
(October 1989).Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
reductase (HMG Co-A) are known. HMG Co-A catalyzes a crucial
step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Inhibitors of this
enzyme are well known as cholesterol lowering agents. See
United States Patent 3,983,140 to Endo et al.Examples of these
inhibitors include the group of physiologic active substances
ML-236. Compactin (ML-236B) is a member of this group, and it
has been isolated from cultures of Penicillium brevicompatum
and Penicillium citrinum. See '140 to Endo et al. See also
