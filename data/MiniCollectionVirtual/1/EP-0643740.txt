<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to elastosols, to a process for 
the preparation of such elastosols, to a process for use of these 
elastosols and to products derived from them. With the term "elastosols" as used throughout this 
specification is meant dispersions of very fine elastomeric block 
copolymer particles in liquid organic media, or more specifically, 
in rubber compatible liquid plasticizers. At present polyvinylchloride plastisols, i.e. dispersions of 
very fine PVC particles in liquid organic media, are widely used 
for a variety of applications, such as in the preparation of bottle 
cap seals, conveyor belts, carpet backing and wall- and 
floor-coverings. In other applications PVC plastisols are processed 
by means of dipping, such as in the case of industrial gloves, 
surgical gloves, shoes, boots and coated wire products. The shaping 
of products by means of roto-casting or moulding, which is the 
reverse of dipping, is also a widely used technique. The latter 
method is particularly suited for the production of hollow goods, 
such as certain toys (balls, dolls and the like). Since there is an 
increasing demand for environmental friendly products, PVC 
containing compositions are the subject of many discussions due to 
the presence of the environmentally charging element chlorine in 
PVC. It will be appreciated that upon disposal of PVC containing 
products, e.g. by incineration, toxic compounds containing chlorine 
may be released into the environment. Therefore, extensive research 
effort is put in by industry to find halogen-free alternatives for 
PVC. However, a significant problem is to find such alternatives, 
which provide at least the same processing and product 
characteristics as the presently applied PVC plastisols. One of the  
 
main advantages of using PVC plastisols namely, is their ability to 
be processed by the above mentioned inexpensive processing 
techniques, such as spreading, moulding or roto-casting and 
dipping, followed by zero-shear fusion of the plastisol to form the 
desired product. These techniques are much more flexible and 
provide higher production speeds than the conventional 
thermoplastics processing techniques like extrusion and injection 
moulding. Up to now not any satisfactory halogen-free alternative 
for PVC plastisols has been found, which can be prepared and 
processed according to said advantageous plastisol processing 
techniques. Moreover, as in the present situation these techniques 
are widely used in the PVC-plastisol industry, it is by
