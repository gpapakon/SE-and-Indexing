<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for convening an enantiomeric form of 
certain aliphatic carboxylic acids into a racemic mixture of enantiomers. This 
invention specifically relates to the racemization of one of the enantiomers of 
profen-type carboxylic acids or ester. Profen-types of compounds are typically defined as propionic acids (or esters) 
bearing at least one aromatic substituent, usually α- to the carboxylic function. These carboxylic acids have an asymmetric carbon atom (the carbon atom 
adjacent to the carbonyl group) that typically produces a racemic mixture of these 
acids [a mixture of both the (+) and (-) or dextro and levo rotorary forms]. For 
example, ibuprofen [(2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid)], a commercially and 
pharmaceutically important chemical compound, is typically produced and sold 
as the racemic mixture. Many other of the pharmaceutically-active profen drugs 
are also produced as racemates and administered in this form. However, it is well 
known that the physiological utility of the racemic mixtures is almost exclusively 
focused on one enantiomer, the other having either no effect or even diminishing 
the effect of the active enantiomer. Thus the S(+) form of ibuprofen is 
physiologically active in reducing inflammation and in providing an analgesic effect. 
See, for example, U. S. Patent Nos. 4,851.444 and 4.877.620. The R(-) enantiomer 
is devoid of activity for these indications, although it is, in part, converted in vivo 
into the S(+) compound. Other profens, i.e., naproxen, are only prescribed as the 
single enantiomer. Patent abstract of Japan, vol. 13, no. 262 (C-608) (3610) 
discloses a method for racemizing an optically active α-substituted 
aryl acetic acid, wherein a mixture of 1-(p-tolyl)ethylamine 
and the optically active a-substituted aryl 
acetic acid is heated in a solvent. It has been found that the inactive or undesirable enantiomer of these 
carboxylic acids or esters may be converted into the other usable, desirable 
enantiomer by heating an aequous solution of the enantiomer at 
70-200°C in the presence of from 0,01% to 10%, based on the 
mole-% of the carboxylic acid enantiomer, of an aliphatic, 
aromatic or mixed aliphatic and aromatic tertiary amine and an 
aliphatic hydrocarbon as a cocatalyst for a time sufficient  
  
 
to racemize the enantiomer. The carboxylic acids and esters useful in the process of the present invention 
have the formula: 
 
where R1 is hydrogen or C1 to C6 linear or branched alkyl, R2, R3 and R4 are 
different
