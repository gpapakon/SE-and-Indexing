<ABSTRACT>
In a picture display arrangement, for example a personal computer and a 
monitor coupled thereto, the PC generates control signals for adjusting monitor settings 

(brightness, contrast, picture position, picture dimensions). The control signals are 
transmitted to the monitor by modulating the sync
hronizing signal (preferably by pulse-width 
modulation). The monitor comprises a demodulator for deriving the control 

signals. This enables manual controls on the monitor to be dispensed with. For this, the 
interface between PC and monitor is not modified. Pulse-width modulation of the 

synchronizing signals is possible by means of a utility program loaded into the PC.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a picture display arrangement comprising a
picture source for generating a video signal and a synchronizing signal, the synchronizing
signal comprising synchronizing pulses whose frequency is representative of the line
frequency or picture frequency of the video signal, and a monitor for displaying a picture
represented by said signals, which monitor has an adjustment circuit for adjusting picture
parameters in response to control signals applied to the circuit, the picture source being suited
to generate the control signals and modulate the synchronizing signal with the control signals,
the monitor having a demodulator for demodulating the synchronizing signal in order to obtain
the control signals. The invention also relates to said picture source and said monitor
separately.An arrangement of the type defined in the opening paragraph is known
from DE 43 05 026 A1. The known arrangement comprises a personal computer and a picture
monitor coupled thereto. The personal computer has a video card, which generates the video
signal and the synchronizing signal. The synchronizing signal is representative of the line
frequency and the picture frequency of the video signal. The arrangement enables adjustment
of picture parameters, such as picture position and brightness, to be controlled from the
computer. When a user inputs a control instruction for adjusting a picture parameter, control
signals are generated and added to the synchronizing signal during a vertical retrace period.
The monitor is adapted to detect these control signals, separate them from the synchronization
signal and apply them to a display control circuit which actually performs the adjustment of
the picture parameters.A disadvantage of the known arrangement is that problems arise when the computer is
combined with a conventional monitor. The control signals which are added by the computer
to the synchronization signal disturb the operation of the conventional monitor. Similar 
problems are to be expected when the prior-art monitor is combined with a conventional
computer. In that case, disturbances in the vertical retrace period (e.g. noise) can be interpreted
by the prior-art monitor as control signals.It is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement which
mitigates the above problems.To this end the arrangement in accordance with the invention is
charactenzed in that the picture source is adapted to modulate the pulse width of the
synchronizing pulses with the control signals and that the demodulator is
