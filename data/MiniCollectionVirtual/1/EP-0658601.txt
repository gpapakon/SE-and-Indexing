<ABSTRACT>
Polyurethane foams having improved flame retardant properties 
employing small quantities of halogenated polyaromatic resin flame-retardant 

additive have been discovered. Brominated polystyrene resin 
is particularly preferred. The additives may be physically suspended in 

the polyol prior to reaction with a polyisocyanate in the presence of a 
polyurethane catalyst in a conventional manner to produce improved 

polyurethane foams. The additives are not chemically bound to other 
components in the foam, such as the polyol. Because small quantities of 

the additives are used, the physical properties of the foams are not 
adversely affected by their presence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the polyurethane foams and methods for 
their preparation, and in one aspect, more particularly relates to polyurethane 
foams having enhanced flame retardant properties through the 
use of solid additives. Polyurethane foams, formed by the reaction of a polyisocyanate 
with a polyhydroxyl-containing compound in the presence of a suitable 
catalyst, are widely accepted as padding materials for cushions in 
furniture, automobiles and the like. Such foams typically burn readily, 
and considerable effort has been devoted to reducing the flammability 
of the foams. One technique by which this may be done is through the 
use of additives to the foam that retard its flammability or help to 
extinguish the burning foam should it ignite. Known flame retardant 
additives include 2,3-dibromo-1,4-butenediol; tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate 
and triethylphosphate, for example. However, a disadvantage 
of using the phosphate-containing additives is that often relatively large 
quantities of the expensive materials must be used, higher than about 
1%. Additionally, liquid phosphorus and halogen-containing flame 
retardants create a plasticizing effect which causes the polyurethane 
foam to be reduced in hardness, lower in compressive strength and 
increased in density so that the foam is detrimentally affected. Ideally, 
the load bearing properties of the foams, such as ILD - indentation load 
deflection and CFD - compression force deflection, should not be 
adversely affected by the presence of the additive. These conventional 
flame retardants are also somewhat volatile and may evaporate out of 
the polyurethane foam over time, thus decreasing the available fire 
retardancy. Finally, there are indications that these materials may be 
corrosive to certain metals on which the foams are applied.  Considerable research has been conducted on flame retardant 
additives for polyurethane foams. For example, melamine is a common 
flame retardant additive for polyurethane foams; see, for example, U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,221,875; UK Patent Applications GB 2,177,405A and GB 
2,177,406A. It is further well known to use polyvinyl chloride in polyurethane 
compositions. U.S. Pat. No. 3,931,062 to Cobbledick teaches that when 
a minor amount of an oxide, hydroxide or basic salt of certain metals 
from Group 2a of the Periodic Table is introduced into a formulation 
for low density flexible and semiflexible hot-molded flame-retardant 
polyetherurethane foam compositions which also contain finely-divided 
solid
