<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic resin composition having in 
admixture a polyphenylene ether resin and an 

elastomeric block copolymer wherein the block 
copolymer has in admixture a triblock copolymer 

A-B-A' and a diblock copolymer A-B with A and A' 
being polymerized vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon 

blocks such as styrene and B being an ethylenealkylene 
block such as ethylene-butylene. The 

composition of this invention can also include 
other additives such as silozane fluids, flame 

retardants, polyolefins, and phosphates, as well 
as fillers, etc. Also included in this invention 

is the process of preparing such compositions and 
articles of manufacture prepared therefrom, such 

as electrical conductor articles or formed 
articles. The compositions of this invention

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to thermoplastic
compositions containing polyphenylene
ether resin and elastomeric multiblock copolymers,
and more particularly, to a blend of multiblock
polymers, and to articles made therefrom.Polyphenylene ether resin (also known and
hereinafter referred to as "PPE") has become
widely accepted in the plastics industry because
of its desirable physical and chemical properties,
such as high heat resistance and dimensional
stability. PPE by itself is dielectric and also
somewhat flame-retarding. Such benefits promote
its use in certain products, for example, as an
insulating material for electrical wire.PPE-based compositions for these insulating
applications sometimes include polyolefins, and
exhibit improved impact strength and chemical
resistance. Reference is therefore made here to
U.S.-A-5 166 264, filed June
23, 1989 (G. Lee, Jr., and J. Yates III), and EP-A-0413972
both of which are assigned to the assignee
of the present application.However, the inclusion of olefinic components
can decrease the flame retardance of the overall
composition, thereby necessitating the addition of
special additives to regain this important
property. As an illustration, U.S. -A-4,808,647 
(V. Abolins et.al.) describes the use of a multi-component
flame retardant composition which
includes an organic phosphate and a brominated
material such as a tetrabromobisphenol-A oligomeric
polycarbonate.While the compositions described in the Abolins
patent exhibit excellent properties suitable for
many applications, it is often desirable to
minimize or eliminate the use of bromine or other
halogen-containing additives in compositions
designed for certain products. For example, the
wire insulation compositions mentioned above
frequently cannot contain halogen additives
because they could form corrosive compounds when
exposed to high temperatures, thereby resulting in
considerable damage to surrounding electrical
equipment. Nevertheless, any modification of such
an insulation composition must not result in significant
decreases in the other important properties
necessary for very durable products, e.g. flexibility
and "stretchability" (elongation).In co-pending U.S.-A- 5294655 filed May
15, 1992 there are disclosed combinations of PPE
resins with certain elastomeric multiblock
copolymers and other additives such as siloxane
fluids, poly-olefins, flame retardants,
stabilizers, fillers and reinforcing agents.
These compositions as reported therein have
improved flexibility and elongation.EP-A-0467113
