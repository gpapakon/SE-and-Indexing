characterized in that a hidden modification to a tariff 

stage is displayed after the taximeter switches over to a 
different tariff stage or to the TOTAL operating mode. 
A taximeter according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a hidden modification to a tariff 

stage is only displayed if evidence of entitlement to 
perceive the display is produced by the user.
