Aqueous dyestuff finish, characterized in that it
contains 0.1-20% by weight of one or more copper 

phthalocyanine dyestuffs of the formula (I)
according to Claim 1 and exhibits a pH of 7 to 13.
Process for dyeing and printing cellulose-containing
material, characterized in that at

least one dyestuff according to Claims 1 or 2 is
used.
Process for dyeing cellulose-containing material,
characterized in that a dyestuff finish according

to Claims 3 is used.
Process according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that the cellulose-containing material is paper

or wood pulp.

fluid using an ink-jet recording system,

characterized in that the recording fluid is a
printing ink according to Claim 7.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the substrate is paper, wood, textiles,

plastic or metal.
