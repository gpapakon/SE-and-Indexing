<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible barrier comprising at least one rail (2) and a secondary rail (10'). The barrier is remarkable in that the rail (2) is supported by two or more spaced apart diamond-shaped mechanical assemblies (3') each consisting of four arms hinged together at their ends, in that said rail (2) is attached to one hinge of each assembly, i.e. a rail hinge (5), while the opposite hinge, i.e. a ground hinge (4), is fixed to the ground or to a member (1) placed on or fixed to the ground, said secondary rail consisting of a rod (10') parallel to the rail passing through or passed through by the other two hinges (6, 7) of each assembly, and in that at least one locking system is provided for locking the barrier in at least one operative position.

Extensible barrier comprising at least one top rail 
(2) and a lower rail (10, 10' 10''), characterised in that 

the top rail (2) is supported by at least two mechanical 
rhombuses (3, 3') separated from one another and each 

formed by four arms articulated together by their ends, 
in that the top rail (2) is fixed to one of the 

articulations of each rhombus, called the top rail 
articulation (5), the diametrically opposing 

articulation, called the ground articulation (4), being 
designed to be fixed to the ground or to an element (1) 

to be fixed or laid on the ground, while the lower rail 
is constituted by at least one rod (10, 10' 10'') which is 

parallel to the top rail and passes through the other two 
articulations (6, 7; 6', 7'; 6'', 7'') of each rhombus, 

called lower rail articulations, or is traversed by 
these, and in that at least one locking system is 

provided to lock the barrier in at least one position of 
use. 
Barrier according to claim 1, characterised in that 
on at least one of the lower rail articulations (6) of 

each rhombus the locking system comprises a tapped ring 
(8), designed to engage with a threaded portion (10a) of 

the lower rail rod (10). 
Barrier according to claim 2, characterised in that 
a means of entrainment in rotation (11) is additionally 

provided so as to be in engagement with the lower rail 
rod (10) such that the rotation of the latter leads to 

the widening or the narrowing of the gap between the 
lower rail articulations (6, 7) and reciprocally the 

narrowing or the widening of the gap between the top rail 
articulations (5) and the ground articulations (4). 
Barrier according to one of claims 2 and 3,  
 

characterised in that for each rhombus (3) the lower rail 
rod (10) exhibits a threaded portion (10a) for just one 

(6) of the lower rail articulations of said rhombus and a 
smooth portion (10b) for the other lower rail 

articulation (7), the latter comprising a ring (9) in 
which said lower rail rod can slide freely. 
Barrier according to claim 1, characterised in that 
for each rhombus and on at least one of the lower rail 

articulations (6", 7") the locking system comprises a 
pawl (12, 13) designed to engage with at least one notch 

(14, 15) formed on the lower rail rod (10") which is made 
capable of rotation in order to be able to disengage from 

the pawl through simple rotation. 
Barrier according to claim 5, characterised in that 
at least one counter weight (16) is provided to maintain 

the lower rail rod (10") in a position in which the 
notches (14, 15) formed in it are turned towards the 

pawls. 
Barrier according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it is constituted by a plurality of 

elementary barriers connected together by means (16') 
which control the lower rails (10") in rotation at will, 

while a rotational locking means can be provided on at 
least one of said elementary barriers. 
Barrier according to claim 1, characterised in that 
for at least some of the rhombuses (3') the locking 

system comprises a double-acting jack (26) whose rod (27) 
acts on one of the arms of said rhombus (3'), while the 

lower rail articulations (6', 7') are mounted slidingly 
in the lower rail (10') such that the operation of the 

jack (26) causes the widening or the narrowing of the gap 
between the lower rail articulations (6', 7') and 

reciprocally the narrowing or the widening of the gap 
between the top rail articulations (5) and the ground  

 
articulations (4). 
Barrier according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the cylinder of the jack is positioned substantially at 

ground level, parallel to the lower rail (10') and to the 
top rail (2), while the rod (27) of said jack is 

articulated through at least one link rod (29) to the 
adjacent one of the arms of the ground articulation (4) 

of said rhombus. 
Barrier according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the end of the rod (27) of the jack (26) is articulated 

to the link rod (29) through the intermediary of at least 
one roller (28). 
Barrier according to one of claims 8 to 10, 
characterised in that one (6') of the two lower rail 

articulations (10') of at least some of the rhombuses 
(3') are linked together by a linking bar (30). 
Barrier according to one of claims 8 to 11, 
characterised in that at least some of the lower rail 

articulations (7') are subjected to the action of a 
compression spring serving notably as a damper during 

lowering. 
Barrier according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the lower rail rod exhibits a 

plurality of sections linked together by articulated 
connectors (17), thus making it possible to form a 

barrier in a jagged line. 
Barrier according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the ground articulation (4) is 

fixed to a base (1) forming at least one plinth, said 
base being designed to be fixed or to rest on the ground. 
Barrier according to claim 14, characterised in that 
the base (1) takes the form of a U. 
Barrier according to one of claims 14 and 15, 
characterised in that the base (1) is designed to be  

 
disposed in an excavation provided for that purpose. 
Barrier according to claim 16, characterised in that 
the base (1) is framed on either side of its length by 

elements (19, 20) forming a ramp and in that it is 
articulated (24, 25) to at least one of said elements 

(19, 20) which rests on the ground such that the other 
element is raised when the barrier is forced towards the 

articulated element. 
Barrier according to one of claims 1 to 17, 
characterised in that the ends of the top rail (2) are 

mounted slidingly in two side uprights (21, 22). 
Barrier according to claim 18, characterised in that 
means (23) are provided in at least one of the uprights 

(21, 22) to operate the barrier by acting on the top rail 
(2).
