<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cleaning assemblies.Various types of cleaning assemblies are known. The following U.S. Patents are
believed to be representative of the most relevant prior art: 2,841,147; 2,925,084;
3,054,403; 3,144,866; 3,337,117; 3,401,695; 3,545, 604; 3,896, 807; 4,159,718;
4,484,904; 4,723,956; 5,006,339.Further, US-A-5,111,934 discloses a cleaning assembly comprising a flat, flexible,
liquid impermeable packet having two separate, stacked, fluid-tight chambers. In the
first chamber a dry towel is enclosed, In the second chamber a wetted sponge is
enclosed. The wetted sponge is used for cleansing and the dry towel is used for drying
the cleansed area. The chamber containing the wetted sponge does not contain a supply
of liquid in addition to the liquid absorbed in the sponge.The present invention seeks to provide an improved cleaning assembly. There is
thus provided in accordance with the present invention a cleaning assembly comprising
a wet tissue and a liquid impermeable packet lying generally in a plane and containing the wet tissue, the cleaning
assembly being characterised in that the liquid permeable packet further comprises a
supply of cleansing liquid and a movable nozzle element selectably extendible from the liquid
impermeable packet in a direction generally co-planar therewith.According to the invention the cleaning assembly may further comprise a dry liquid
absorbent tissue mounted onto the liquid impermeable packet.Preferably, the liquid impermeable packet is generally elongate and extends along
a longitudinal axis and the nozzle element extends perpendicular to the longitudinal 
axis.In accordance with a preferred embodiment present invention, the nozzle element
is integrally formed with a spring.Preferably, the assembly also includes a retractable piercing element which is located
within the nozzle element.Preferably, the dry liquid absorbent tissue includes a multiple ply tissue whose plies
are separable and separately foldable.Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
the packet serves as a liquid impermeable backing for the dry liquid absorbent tissue
during use thereof.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the integrally
formed spring includes a compression spring.The present invention will be understood and appreciated more fully from the following
detailed description, taken in conjunction with the drawings in which:
Figs. 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D illustrate an intimate cleaning assembly

<CLAIMS>
A cleaning assembly comprising:

a wet tissue (18) and a liquid impermeable packet (10) lying generally in a plane and
containing said wet tissue (18), characterised in that the liquid impermeable packet

(10) further comprises a supply of cleansing liquid and a movable nozzle element
(28) selectably extendible from the liquid impermeable packet (10) in a direction

generally co-planar therewith.
A cleaning assembly according to claim 1, characterised in that it further
comprises a dry liquid absorbent tissue (24) mounted onto the liquid impermeable

packet (10).
A cleaning assembly according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
liquid impermeable packet is generally elongate and extends along a longitudinal axis

and that the nozzle element (28) extends perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.
A cleaning assembly according to any of the preceding claims, charactised
in that the nozzle element (28) is integrally formed with a spring (32).
A cleaning assembly according to claim 4, characterised in that the integrally
formed spring (32) comprises a compression spring.
A cleaning assembly according to any of the preceding claims, characterised
in that it further comprises a retractable piercing element (26) which is located

within the nozzle element (28). 
A cleaning assembly according to claim 6, characterised in that the piercing
element (26) is hollow and arranged such that the liquid contained in the packet
