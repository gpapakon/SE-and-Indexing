<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a drive transmission and a gearbox for engine-powered road vehicles, in particular passenger cars. Fitted in the drive train between the engine and the differential gear in the driven axle is, in addition to the main gearbox, an intermediate gearbox, with a gear shift, designed for retrofit.

<CLAIMS>
Gearbox for engine-powered road vehicles, in particular 
passenger cars, with a drive line which exhibits a standard 

drive gear between the engine (1) and a differential gear 
(6) of a driven axle (4), whereby the gearbox exhibits, in 

addition to a drive gear (2), a selectable intermediate 
gear intended for subsequent installation, which has two 

shafts (8, 9), which are connected together in a pivoting 
manner by a bearing, for example by a fixed bearing or an 

adjusted bearing, and form a common, two-part main shaft, 
an intermediate shaft (21) with toothed wheels (22, 23) 

which cooperate with toothed wheels (15, 16) of the main 
shaft, and a coupling device (17), which is selectable via 

an adjusting device in such a way that the power 
transmission in one selected state of the coupling device 

(17) comes direct via the two shafts (7, 8) of the main 
shaft, and in another selected state of the coupling 

device, comes via the toothed wheels (15, 16, 22, 23) and 
the intermediate shaft, whereby the coupling device is a 

synchronising device (17) and the adjusting device is 
formed by at least one hydraulic cylinder (25), 

characterised in that the intermediate gear is designed 
symmetrically in such a way that its drive and output are 

exchangeable, i.e. the intermediate gear may as desired be 
fitted as the speed increasing or speed reduction gear. 
Gearbox according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
intermediate gear (7) exhibits a selector shaft (20) for 

selection, which is movable by a prescribed stroke in a 
housing (14) of the intermediate gear (7), and that the 

selector shaft (20) has a piston (24) at least at one end, 
which is movable in a cylinder (25) of the adjusting 

device. 
Gearbox according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
selector shaft (20) exhibits at both ends a piston (24) in 

a cylinder (25) to form two hydraulic cylinders.  
 
Gearbox according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised in 
that the selector positions of the intermediate gear (7) 

are each fixed in a counterlock (34) by engagement of at 
least one spring lock element (31, 32). 
Gearbox according to one of claims 1 - 4, characterised in 
that the intermediate gear (7) only has two selection 

positions, the first with a transmission ratio of one and 
a second selection position with a transmission smaller or 

greater than one. 
Gearbox according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
first selection position corresponds to a through drive, 

preferably in a form such that the transmissions of both 
shafts (8, 9) are directly connected to one another. 
Gearbox according to one of claims 2 - 6, characterised in 
that to adjust the stroke of the selector shaft (20) an 

adjustable stop projecting above the surface of the piston 
surface is provided on at least one piston (24), and that 

this stop is formed by the head of a screw (29). 
Gearbox according to claim 7, characterised in that to 
adjust the stop between the head of the screw (29) and an 

adjacent surface of the piston (24) different numbers 
and/or thicknesses of washers (30) are used. 
Gearbox according to one of claims 1 - 8, characterised in 
that the gearing of the intermediate gear (7) corresponds 

to approximately half the progressive ratio of the standard 
drive gear, for example between 0.9 and 0.8, preferable 

0.88. 
Gearbox according to one of claims 1 - 9, characterised by 
at least one propeller shaft (5, 35) connecting the 

intermediate gear (7) with the drive gear (2) and/or with 
the differential (6), which, together with the intermediate 

gear, forms a kit or retrofit kit matched to the vehicle.  
 
Gearbox according to one of claims 1 - 10, characterised by 
a torque support between the drive gear (2) and the 

intermediate gear (7), which is preferably also a component 
of the kit. 
Transmission for engine-powered motor vehicles, in 
particular passenger cars, with a gearbox according to one 

of claims 1 - 11 in a drive line between the engine (1) and 
a differential gear (6) of a driven axle (4).
