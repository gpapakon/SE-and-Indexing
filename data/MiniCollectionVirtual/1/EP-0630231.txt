Liposomes containing a pharmaceutical active 
substance,
wherein
 
they contain 30 to 50 mol % cholesterol, 49 to 

56 mol % phospholipids and 1 to 14 mol % of one or 
several compounds of the general formula I 


 
or salts thereof in relation to the total lipid 

components of the liposomes,
 
in which R¹ and R² can be the same or different and 

represent hydrogen, C₁-C₄ alkyl groups or saturated 
or unsaturated C₈-C₂₄ acyl groups which can, if 

desired, be branched or/and substituted provided 
that at least one of the residues R¹ and R² is an 

acyl group as defined above, and which can be 
obtained by dissolving 1 to 14 mol % of compounds 

of the general formula I together with the other 
lipid components of the liposomes in an amount that 

together with the compounds of the general 
formula I amounts to 100 mol % in a suitable 

solvent, removing the solvent in a vacuum and 
taking up the remaining finely dispersed lipid film 

with an aqueous buffer solution with formation of a 
lipid suspension and pre-heating, during which in 

order to entrap water-insoluble active substances, 
these are dissolved together with the lipid 

components and in order to entrap water-soluble 
active substances, these are admixed as an aqueous 

solution with the lipid film the suspension is  
 

converted into a liposome suspension by being 
pressed from a pressure cell under increased 

pressure and this is sterilized by filtration. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 1,
wherein
 
they contain 3 to 10 mol % of compounds of formula 

(I) or salts thereof. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein
 
R¹ is a C₁₄-C₂₄ acyl group and R² is hydrogen. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 3,
wherein
 
the compounds of formula (I) are selected from the 

group comprising 1-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 
acid, 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid, 1-myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 

acid and 1-erucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 
acid as well as 

salts thereof. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 4,
wherein
 
the compounds are the monosodium salts of the said 

phosphatidic acids. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein
 
R¹ and R² are C₁₄-C₂₄ acyl groups.  

 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 6,
wherein
 
the compounds of formula (I)
 are selected from the 
group comprising 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 

acid, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 
acid, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 

acid and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric 
acid as well as the salts thereof. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 7,
wherein
 
the compounds are the monosodium salts of the said 

phosphatidic acids. 
Liposomes as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 8,
wherein
 
the phospholipids are phosphoglycerides. 
Liposomes as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 9,
wherein
 
they contain lecithins of the general formula II as 

phospholipids 

 
in which R³ and R⁴ can be the same or different and 

represent saturated or unsaturated C₈-C₂₄ acyl 
groups which if desired, can be branched or/and 

substituted. 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 10,
wherein
 
R³ and R⁴ are C₁₄-C₂₄ acyl groups.  

 
Liposomes as claimed in claim 11,
wherein
 
R³ and R⁴ are stearoyl, palmitoyl, myristoyl or 

erucoyl residues. 
Liposomes as claimed in one of the previous claims,
wherein
 
the compound of formula (I) is 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate 

and the phospholipid is 1,2-disteraroyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine. 
Liposomes as claimed in one of the previous claims,
wherein
 
the active substance is selected from the group 

doxorubicin, anthracyclin antibiotic, idarubicin, 
carboplatin, taxol and cytokine.
