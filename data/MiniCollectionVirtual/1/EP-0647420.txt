<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a piece of furniture for sitting and lying on, at least one carriage (2; 24, 26) is extendably arranged in a furniture frame (1, 21), the carriage being provided with upholstery (23, 25) and forming a lying area in its extended position. The carriage (2; 24, 26) is connected via at least one push-and-pull member (5) to a motor drive (11, 12) arranged expediently in the furniture frame (1, 21), so that it can be extended and retracted by motor. In order to achieve simple installation into the furniture frame (1, 21), the push-and-pull member is designed as a link chain (5), the individual links (6) of which are provided with stops (8, 9) which cooperate with one another and limit pivoting of the links (6) in one direction.
