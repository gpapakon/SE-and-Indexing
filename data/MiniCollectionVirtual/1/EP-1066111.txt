<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to Raney nickel catalysts obtained by allowing the melt of an alloy consisting of 50 to 95 wt. % aluminium, 10 to 50 wt. % nickel, 0 to 20 wt. % iron, 0 to 15 wt. % cerium, cerium misch metal, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum or manganese and optionally, other glass-forming elements with a cooling rate of

 K/s to harden rapidly, and then subjecting the rapidly hardened alloy to a treatment with organic or inorganic bases. The invention also relates to a method for producing the inventive Raney nickel catalyst and to its use in the hydrogenation of organic compounds, especially aromatic nitro compounds.

a rotating cooling wheel or into the gap between two

cooling wheels rotating in opposite directions and the
rapidly solidified alloy is then subjected to a

treatment with organic or inorganic bases.
