<ABSTRACT>
A low-cost miniature coaxial connector is provided, which attaches securily to a coaxial cable. The connector includes inner and outer contacts (30, 32, Fig. 2) constructed of rolled sheet metal and separated by an insulator (34). An inner ferrule (70) formed form a seamless tube, is first crimped around the jacket (24) of the coaxial cable. The braided outer conductor (22) of the cable is wrapped backwards around the crimped inner ferrule. The rear end (60) of the outer contact is held tightly around the braiding by an outer ferrule (72) that is crimped around the rear end of the outer contact. By crimping to the jacket (24) of the cable, the connector is securily held to the cable to withstand relatively large forces pulling the cable away from the connector. The sheet metal outer contact (32) can be reliably crimped in place by the seamless outer ferrule (72) which is crimped around it to hold it tightly around the braiding of the cable outer conductor (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
Miniature coaxial connectors are often constructed with machined 
inner and outer contacts. Since the contacts are of a relatively complex shape, 
machining them can be expensive. Sheet metal parts have not been widely 
used because it can be difficult to attach them to the cable so as to withstand 
moderate forces pulling the cable away from the connector. U.S. Patent 
4,891,022 shows a crimped ferrule around sheet metal parts. A connector 
which could be constructed at low cost, but which could be reliably held to a 
coaxial cable, would be of value. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a 
low-cost coaxial connector and cable assembly is provided, as well as the 
connector itself, wherein the connector is reliably secured to the cable. The 
connector includes inner and outer contacts and an insulator between them. 
The outer contact is formed of sheet metal rolled to a largely cylindrical shape. 
A rear portion of the outer contact is mechanically and electrically connected 
to the cable by first crimping a ferrule around insulation of the cable, preferably 
around the outer insulation or jacket of the cable. The outer conductor of the 
cable is placed around the crimped inner ferrule, the rear portion of the outer 
contact is placed around the cable outer conductor, and an outer ferrule is 
crimped around the sheet metal outer contact. Where the inner ferrule is 
crimped to the outer insulator or jacket of the cable, the connection provides 
a high holding force between the outer contact and the jacket of the cable to 
withstand substantial forces that tend to pull the cable out of the connector. 
Although the ferrules are seamless, they can be constructed at low cost from 
ordinary seamless tubing. This allows the connector contacts, especially the 
outer contact, to be constructed of  
 
rolled sheet metal, which enables contact construction at 
low cost. The novel features of the invention are set forth 
with particularity in the appended claims. The invention 
will be best understood from the following description when 
read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a sectional isometric view of a coaxial 
connector and cable assembly constructed in accordance with 
the present invention. Fig. 2 is a side view of the assembly of Fig. 1, 
with the portion above the central line or axis being shown

A coaxial cable assembly comprising a coaxial connector which terminates 
a coaxial cable 

(14) that includes a cable inner conductor (16), a cable inner insulation (20) 
around said inner conductor, a cable outer conductor (22) in the form of a 

braiding that surrounds said inner insulation, and an insulative cable jacket (24) 
around said braiding with said jacket having a forward end, wherein an inner 

ferrule (70) lies closely around said cable jacket and said jacket is trimmed 
forward of said inner ferrule with said braiding having an exposed portion 

wrapped backward around said inner ferrule, and said connector includes an 
outer contact (32) having a rearward portion (60) lying about said exposed 

wrapped braiding portion, and an outer ferrule (72) which is crimped around 
said outer contact rearward portion to hold said outer contact rearward portion 

crimped around said braiding, characterized by 

said inner ferrule (70) has a forward end that lies substantially 
even with said jacket forward end, with said inner ferrule being in a crimped 

state lying around and pressing against said cable jacket (24) independently 
of said outer ferrule, to enable the effective transfer of mechanical force 

between said cable jacket and said rearward portion of said outer conductor. 
A method for terminating a coaxial cable that has cable 
inner and outer conductors (16, 22) lying respectively within cable inner and 

outer insulators (20, 24), to a coaxial connector (12) which includes inner and 
outer contacts (30, 32) and an insulator (34) between them, by connecting said 

inner conductor to said inner contact, placing an inner ferrule (70) around said 
cable outer insulator (24), wrapping a portion of said outer cable conductor 

around said inner ferrule, inserting said inner ferrule and the portion of said 
cable outer conductor lying therearound into a rearward portion (60) of said 

outer contact, and crimping an outer ferrule (72) around a part of said outer 
contact rearward portion which lies around said inner ferrule, to keep said outer 

contact part tightly squeezed around said outer conductor, characterized by: 

said step of placing said inner ferrule, includes crimping it around 
said one of said cable insulators, and said step of crimping an outer ferrule 

includes placing said outer conductor and said outer ferrule around said 
crimped inner ferrule and said outer cable conductor, and crimping said outer 

ferrule. 
The method described in claim 2, wherein: 

said step of crimping said inner ferrule, includes locating said 
inner ferrule forward end substantially even with said outer insulator forward 

end, and then crimping said inner ferrule around said cable outer insulator (24).
