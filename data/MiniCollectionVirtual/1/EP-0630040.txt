<ABSTRACT>
A composition change and a 3-dimensional 
strained structure in an interface or thin film of a 

layered thin film specimen are detected with a 
resolution of atom order and quantitatively analyzed. 

An accelerated electron beam (11) is impinged upon a 
specimen (12) cleaved in a wedge form. An equal 

thickness fringe (23) appearing on a transmitted image 
(19) is detected. By utilizing such a phenomenon that 

the distance t of the equal thickness fringe (23) is 
changed by a lattice plane inclination, angle distribution 

of lattice plane inclination is measured. An 
analysis of the strained structure is made. Furthermore, 

processing is conducted so that the equal 
thickness fringe (23) may represent only the composition 

change, and a quantitative analysis of the composition 
distribution is also made. By estimating the 

composition change and strained structure in the 
heterointerface and thin film with a resolution of atom 

order, relations between characteristics and the 
composition change and strained structure of a strained 

superlattice device or the like can be elucidated. 
Thus, not only defective analysis can be made, but also 

information concerning optimization of the process 
condition and device structure is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron
microscope apparatus for composition and strain analysis
and an observation method thereof for providing guides
to process check, optimization, and device design by
analyzing quantitatively composition and strained
structure of corpuscles located in a heterointerface or
a thin film of a device formed by crystalline growth,
especially a device utilizing a strained superlattice
such as a high mobility transistor or a super-high-speed
semiconductor laser.For evaluating the composition distribution
and strained structure in a thin film or in the vicinity
of a heterointerface of a strained superlattice device,
there is needed a technique capable of measuring the
composition and strained structure with a high depth
resolution while keeping association with the cross-sectional
structure of the device. In order to satisfy
this need, several measuring methods using an electron
microscope have heretofore been invented. For example,
in "Method for quantitatively analyzing composition by
using electron microscope" described in JP-A-62-26755,
composition changes in a thin film or in the vicinity of
a heterointerface are measured by impinging an electron
beam upon a specimen cleaved in a wedge form, obtaining 
a bright-field image formed by its transmitted wave,
detecting an equal thickness fringe appearing on the
image, and utilizing such a phenomenon that intensity
distribution of the equal thickness fringe is changed
according to composition. Furthermore, in a strain
measuring method described in Japanese Journal of
Applied Physics, Vol. 30, 1991, pp. L52-L55, strain
distribution is measured as an amount of inclination of
a lattice plane by using a bright-field image and such a
phenomenon that intensity distribution of the equal
thickness fringe is changed by a slight inclination of
the lattice plane caused by lattice strain.According to the above described composition
distribution measuring method, composition distribution
can be determined beforehand for an unstrained specimen
on the basis of a change in intensity distribution of
the equal thickness fringe. Whether there is bending or
not in the lattice plane and its angle distribution can
be determined, only in case where the structure factor
is similar between thin films and the intensity
distribution of the equal thickness fringe does not
change even if the composition is changed. This method
can be applied to only specimens placed under restricted
conditions.Furthermore, even if the above described two
conventional
