<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing shaped sintered parts containing finely divided carbon by shaping a mixture of     a) a ceramic and/or metallic powder and b) polyoxymethylene and/or a copolymer containing a predominant proportion of oxymethylene units to give a green body, removing the binder by treatment with a gaseous acid, pyrolysis and sintering, with there being added to the mixture of a) and b) a thermoplastic c) which, at temperatures of from 90 to 220 DEG C, is molten, miscible with polyoxymethylene and stable and does not undergo a crosslinking reaction with formaldehyde, and also a composition for this process.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing shaped sintered parts by shaping a
mixture of


a) a ceramic powder and
b) polyoxymethylene and/or a copolymer containing a predominant
proportion of oxymethylene units

to give a green body, removing the binder by treatment with a
gaseous acid and sintering, where there is added to the mixture

of a) and b) a thermoplastic c) which is molten at from
90°C to 220°C, is miscible with and stable to b) and does not

undergo a crosslinking reaction with formaldehyde, wherein a
pyrolysis step is carried out prior to the sintering in order

to convert the thermoplastic c) into finely divided carbon.
A process for producing shaped sintered parts as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the thermoplastic used is a phenoxy resin of

the general formula I


where n is from 20 to 500. 
A process for producing shaped sintered parts as claimed in
claim 1, wherein SiC, WC, TiC, TaC, ZrC, SiO
2
 and/or TiO
2
 are
used as ceramic powder.
A process for producing shaped sintered parts as claimed in
claim 1, wherein α-SiC and/or β-SiC are used as ceramic

powder.
A process for producing shaped sintered parts as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the pyrolysis is carried out at from 600 to

1500°C under inert gas.
A process for producing shaped sintered parts as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the pyrolysis is carried out at from 600 to

1200°C under inert gas.
