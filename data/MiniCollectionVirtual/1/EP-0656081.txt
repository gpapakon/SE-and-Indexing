<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a washing process known per se in which the detergent concentration is analytically determined indirectly by determining the content of a reducing sugar which, when the detergent is prepared, is added in a quantity which is proportional to that of the active washing substance. To this end the sugar may be added before the preparation of the actual detergent in a given constant ratio to the active washing substance or the washing agent to be used.

<CLAIMS>
A washing process using an aqueous solution of washing-active 
substance, in which the concentration of washing-active 

substance in the solution is determined, characterized 
in that the determination is carried out indirectly 

by determining the content of a reducing sugar which is 
added during preparation of the wash liquor in a quantity 

proportional to the quantity of washing-active substance. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the sugar is 
present in a certain quantity in the detergent used to 

prepare the wash liquor. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the sugar 
content is photometrically determined after a colour-forming 

reaction between the sugar and a reagent added to 
the analysis solution. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, in which the sugar 
content is continuously determined by flow injection 

analysis in a stream branched off from the wash liquor. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, in which an aromatic 
hydrazine derivative is used as the colour-forming reagent. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, in which 4-aminobenzhydrazide 
is used as the reagent. 
A washing process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
in which the result of the content determination is used in 

a partly or fully automated process for controlling detergent 
dosage in the preparation or regeneration of the wash 

liquor. 
The use of reducing sugar in detergents as a tracer 
substance for determining the concentration of detergent in 

a liquor prepared from the detergent.
