<ABSTRACT>
A signal conditioner (116) is provided for the output of a digital sound source (110) in a dual digital/analog motion picture theater sound system so that the digitally derived audio signal emulates the analog sound track (58) signal. This allows the digitial source to be easily integrated into the overall sound system, without displacing the existing analog sound track system. The theater sound playback mechanism (124) is provided with the conditioned audio signal when the digital sound source is actuated, and receives the analog sound track signal at other times. The conditioning circuit includes an adjustable impedance (P1, P2) to match the current from the digital sound source to the current from the analog sound track reader (102), a high frequency variable signal adjuster (146) that is complementary to a high frequency emphasis built into the theater playback system, and an optional subwoof output (118).

 DIGITAL SOUND SYSTEM FOR MOTION PICTURES WITH ANALOGSOUND TRACK EMULATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to digital sound systems for motion picture films.Description of the Prior ArtCurrent motion picture films employ analog sound re¬ cording techniques. Most motion pictures use an analog optical sound track that is printed onto the film along with the picture, and is optically scanned to reproduce the sound. Another technique is to record the sound onto mag¬ netic strips that are coated along the edges of the film; this process is used for example in producing "Dolby® 70mm Sound". Optical sound tracks can become dirty and produce a noisy output. Magnetically recorded sound tracks are sub¬ ject to noise problems similar to those encountered with other audio tapes. It would be highly desirable to upgrade the quality of motion picture sound to a level comparable to that achieved with a compact disc.The majority of multitrack motion picture theaters are designed to exhibit Dolby stereo-optical films. This is a two track optical sound format that provides left and right analog sound tracks with derived center and surround tracks. The sound tracks for this format are recorded as two "dual bilateral" variable area tracks in the conven¬ tional optical track area of the motion picture release print. During the motion picture post production sound mixing process the sound tracks are mixed through a two- track matrixing device that allows the sound mixers to hear exactly how the left, right, and derived center and sur¬ round tracks will sound in a stereo-optical theater; this is the current standard method of mixing motion picture sound tracks. Although the dual tracks are recorded using noise re-] SUBSTJTUTESHEET 

 duction techniques such as Dolby type A, they have a dynam¬ ic range that is significantly less than that of magnetic or digital tracks. The dual tracks are also susceptible to all of the well known failings of optical sound tracks, including a limited frequency response and a susceptibility to noise caused by dust on the film. In addition, the film exposing and developing steps used to produce the optical sound tracks are quite variable, resulting in an optical sound track quality that can vary dramatically. However, the majority of all current motion pictures are released with this standard type of sound track.It has previously been proposed to replace the analog optical sound track with a digital sound track that digi¬ tally encodes the sound.
