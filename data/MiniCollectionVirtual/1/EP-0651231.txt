<ABSTRACT>
The thickness of printed matter (2) resting astride a support (3) is measured by means of a scanning unit (7) which has two scanning elements (sensing elements, contact elements) (12, 13) which can be forced back counter to the force of a spring. In a measuring zone (Z), the one scanning element (12) is seated on the support (3) and the other scanning element (13) is seated on the printed matter (2). Two laser sensors (19, 20) are then used, on the one hand, to measure the length (l) of the path (section) (a) between the one laser sensor (19) and a measuring surface (22a) of the first scanning element (12) and, on the other hand, the length (l') of the path (b) between the other laser sensor (20) and a measuring surface (23a) of the second scanning element (13). The thickness of the printed matter (2) can then be determined from the difference between the lengths (l, l') of these two paths (a, b). By comparing this actual thickness value with a prescribed thickness value, it can then be established whether the measured printed matter (2) is complete or whether pages, parts or supplements are missing or whether the printed matter (2) has too many sides, parts or supplements.

A method for measuring the thickness of passing printed 
products, such as newspapers, magazines and parts thereof, lying 

on a support (3), characterized in that for the thickness measurement 
on one product (2) at a time, there is established, on 

the one hand, by means of a first laser sensor (19) arranged 
fixed in position, the length (l) of a distance (a) characteristic of the 

interspacing between this first laser sensor (19) and the 
support (3) serving as a reference element, and on the other 

hand, by means of a second laser sensor (20) also arranged fixed 
in position, the length (l') of a distance (b) characteristic of the 

interspacing between this second laser sensor (20) and the top 
(2a) of the product (2) remote from the support (3), and that 

subsequently, the thickness of the product (2) is determined 
from the difference of the lengths (l, l') of these two 

distances (a, b). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
length (l, l') of each distance (a, b) between each laser sensor 

(19, 20) and a measuring face (22a, 23a), associated with the 
support (3) or the top (2a) of the product (2), is measured in 

each case by means of one associated feeler element (12, 13) 
which bears during the measurement stage on the support (3) or 

on the product (2), in which arrangement the feeler elements 
(12, 13) move along with the product (2) or the support (3). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
for detecting incorrectly assembled mulitsheet or multipart 

products (2), the determined thickness of a product is compared 
with a desired value, and an identification signal (t) is generated 

in the case of a deviation of the measured actual value 
from the desired value, which exceeds a threshold value. 
A device for measuring the thickness of printed products, 
such as newspapers, magazines and parts thereof moving past a  

 
measurement station (5) and lying on a support (3),
 
characterized by two laser sensors (19, 20) fixed in position in 

the measurement station (5) and connected to an evaluation unit 
(46), disposed down the line, the first laser sensor (19) 

whereof serves to measure the length (l) of a distance (a) 
characteristic of the interspacing between this first laser sensor (19) 

and the support (3) serving as a reference element, and the 
second laser sensor (20) serves to measure the length (l') of a 

distance (b) characteristic of the interspacing between this second laser 
sensor (20) and the top (2a) of the product (2) to be measured, 

remote from the support (3), in which arrangement the thickness 
of the measured product (2) is determined in the evaluation unit 

(46) from the difference of the lengths (l, l') on the basis of 
the measured values (U
a
, U
b
) delivered by the laser sensors (19, 
20). 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that at 
least one feeler unit (7) is provided which runs along with the 

product (2) or the support (3) during the measurement stage and 
has two feeler elements (12, 13) associated with one laser 

sensor (19, 20) each, one feeler element (12) whereof can during 
the measurement stage be positioned on the support (3), and the 

other feeler element (13) can be positioned on the product (2), 
and each feeler element (12, 13) whereof has a measuring face 

(22a, 23a) facing the associated laser sensor (19, 20), between 
which and the assigned laser sensor (19, 20), the distance (l,
