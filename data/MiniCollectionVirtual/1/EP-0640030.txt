Method of manufacturing a lightweight plate-shaped 
or square building component as building 

material for load-bearing structures for board-type 
linings, boards, tiles, flags, panels etc., consisting 

of a plate- or block-shaped base material of foam, 
recycled granules or similar with a fabric or 

textile, which is secured by a binder, to protect 
and strengthen the surface, characterised in that, 

before the introduction of the textile or fabric, 
a grid is formed in the base material, the depth 

of which corresponds to the thickness of the textile 
or fabric, whereafter the textile or fabric is 

then introduced into the grid-like cavities and 
grooves, whereafter the surface is overcoated 

with the binder, brushed, pressed or rolled smooth, 
so that the textile or fabric is embedded only 

in the upper layer of the base material according 
to its thickness in such a way that the textile 

or fabric forms a level, smooth face with the 
surface of the base material together with the 

binder.

linings, boards, tiles, flags, panels etc., consisting

and strengthen the surface, characterised in that, 
before the introduction of the textile or fabric, 

a grid is formed in the base material, the depth 
of which corresponds to the thickness of the textile 

or fabric, whereafter a binder is applied to the 
surface which penetrates the grooves or channels 

of the grid and whereafter the textile or fabric 
is then introduced into the grid-like cavities 

and grooves, whereafter the surface is brushed, 
pressed or rolled smooth, so that the textile 

or fabric is embedded only in the upper layer 
of the base material according to its thickness 

in such a way that the textile or fabric forms 
a level, smooth face with the surface of the base 

material together with the binder. 
Method of manufacturing a lightweight plate-shaped 
or square building component as building 

material for load-bearing structures for board-type 
linings, boards, tiles, flags, panels etc., consisting  

 
of a plate- or block-shaped base material of foam, 

recycled granules or similar with a fabric or 
textile, which is secured by a binder, to protect 

and strengthen the surface, characterised in that 
the textile or fabric is so pressed into the surface, 

which is shapeable or still shapeable before hardening, 
of the plate- or block-shaped base material by 

means of a roller which has several profiled 
elevations around its circumference or a corresponding 

pressure die that it forms a surface level with 
that of the base material, whereafter the surface 

is overcoated with the binder and brushed, pressed 
and/or rolled smooth, so that the textile or fabric 

is embedded only into the upper layer of the base 
material corresponding to its thickness, in such 

a way that the textile or fabric forms a level, 
smooth face with the surface of the base material 

together with the binder. 
Method according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that synthetic or natural 

binders or mixtures of synthetic and natural binders 
are used as binders. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that thin-bed mortar is used 

as the binder.  
 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that lime- or gypsum-based binders 

are used as the binder.
