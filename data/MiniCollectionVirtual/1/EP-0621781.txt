<DESCRIPTION>
 Use of 3-arylindole and 3-arylindazole derivatives for the treatment of psychoses.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the use of a certain class of 3-arylindole and 3- arylindazoie derivatives or salts thereof for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of psychoses.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONDamping of dopamine (DA) overactivity by the use of DA receptor blocking drugs is today the most important principle in the treatment of schizophrenia, more particu¬ larly the positive symptoms thereof. "Classical neuroleptics" such as haioperidol, cis(Z)-flupentixol or chlorpromazine are believed to induce antipsychotic effect via DA receptor blockade. Pharmacologically, such compounds antagonize stereoty- pies induced by dopaminergic compounds (i.e. methylphenidate, apomorphine, amphetamine) in mice or rats and they inhibit pergolide-induced circling behavior in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions. Unfortunately, the incidence of severe extrapy- ramidal side effects (EPS) (dystonia, akathisia and parkinsonism) is very frequent in long term treatment with these neuroleptics and causes great concern among clinicians. The EPS are difficult to treat, and unsuccessful treatment often leads to poor medication compliance. Some of these neurological side effects, which generally involve involuntary movement disorders, have been correlated to the propensity of the drugs to induce catalepsy in rats (Arnt. et al., Neuropharmacology, 1981 , 20, 1331-1334).A few compounds, which do not produce EPS and which are effective in the treat¬ ment of schizophrenic disorders, are termed "atypical neuroleptics". Clozapine is such a drug. Clozapine is an effective antipsychotic in man but, due to the risk of drug induced agranulocytosis, regular monitoring of blood parameters is required, and its use is therefore costly and restricted. Pharmacologically, clozapine induces no catalepsy in rats, neither does it inhibit stereotypies induced by dopaminergic 

compounds in rodents. Clozapine blocks central cholinergϊc, serotonergic and noradrenergic receptors in animal studies.In recent years several reports have suggested that inhibition of the spontaneous ac- tivity of DA neurones in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the rat brain upon re¬ peated treatment with a drug is indicative of the antipsychotic potential of the drug, whereas inhibition of the activity in substaπtia nigra pars compacta (SNC) is indicative of the development of EPS. "Classical neuroleptics" are active in both areas in
