<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a solid cosmetic composition with the help of plaster, in which:   - a pulverulent mixture (P) consisting of the following is prepared:       1) calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO4 . 1/2 H2O) in powder form, 2) a hydrophobic fraction (FO) comprising at least one fatty substance and/or at least one pulverulent material which has been treated by chemical grafting or coating so as to impart hydrophobic characteristics thereto, 3) a hydrophilic fraction (FI) in powder form, the FI/FO weight proportion being between 0.08 and 7.5;     - an aqueous phase (AP) is prepared in liquid form; - the pulverulent mixture (P) and the aqueous phase (AP) are blended in a P/AP weight proportion of between 0.2 and 2, so as to obtain a flowable mixture;   - the flowable mixture is poured into a mould; - it is left to harden (set) by hydration of the calcium sulphate hemihydrate to calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO4.2H2O) and is removed from the mould.
