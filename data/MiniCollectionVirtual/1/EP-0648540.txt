<ABSTRACT>
Method for the treatment of waste products which have aspects 
hazardous to health to produce a non-hazardous product or 

substance, by encapsulating said waste products, such as, for 
example, products containing asbestos or rock dust, with which 

method said products are ground, chopped or comminuted in some 
other way, in a chamber (1) which is completely isolated from 

the surroundings and from the operators, to produce small 
particles in such a way that said products pass during and/or 

immediately after comminution into a liquid (11) which engulfs 
the particles obtained and the particles encapsulated in this 

way are removed and/or packaged under airtight conditions. The 
invention also comprises an installation with which a road 

surface which, for example, contains asbestos can be cleared 
away.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the treatment of 
waste products which have aspects hazardous to health to 
produce a non-hazardous product or substance, by encapsulating 
said waste products, such as, for example, products containing 
asbestos or rock dust. It is nowadays generally known, and also a legal 
requirement, that waste products which are hazardous to health, 
in particular asbestos products which, for example, are 
released during demolition work, must be packed in plastic 
before they are handed over to waste treatment companies. This 
demands a very large quantity of plastic. Moreover, it is a 
legal requirement that employees carrying out this packaging 
must have a one hour break after every two hour work period. As 
asbestos-containing products, such as corrugated sheeting, are 
frequently encountered during demolition work, the treatment of 
asbestos-containing products is an expensive and unpleasant 
operation. Apart from asbestos there are, of course, other 
substances which are unhealthy, for example products which 
contain or produce rock dust and which, for example, can give 
rise to pneumoconiosis. The aim of the invention is to provide a method and 
installation with which it is possible, in a very simple and 
inexpensive manner, to treat these products which are hazardous 
to health, such as asbestos, in such a way that packaging in 
plastic is no longer required and said making safe of said 
hazardous products can be carried out not only by companies 
equipped for this purpose but also on site using a relatively 
small, for example mobile, installation of suitable design. This aim is achieved according to the invention firstly 
in that said products are ground, chopped or comminuted in some 
other way, in a chamber which is completely isolated from the 
surroundings and from the operators, to produce small particles 
in such a way that said products pass during and/or immediately 
after comminution into a liquid which engulfs the particles  
 
obtained and the particles encapsulated in this way are removed 
and/or packaged under airtight conditions. It is necessary, therefore, merely to feed the waste 
products via a suitably dimensioned inlet opening into the 
container in which said products are then comminuted to produce 
particles which pass into a liquid which completely engulfs 
them, after which the particles can be removed in the 
encapsulated state in an airtight manner. There is thus no risk 
whatsoever of particles escaping from the container, which risk 
can

Method for the treatment of waste products which 
have aspects hazardous to health to produce a non-hazardous 

product or substance, by encapsulating said waste products, 
such as, for example, product
s containing asbestos or rock 
dust, characterised in that said products are ground, chopped 

or comminuted in some other way, in a chamber (1) which is 
completely isolated from the surroundings and from the 

operators, to produce small particles in such a way that said 
products pass during and/or immediately after comminution into 

a liquid (11) which engulfs the particles obtained and the 
particles encapsulated in this way are removed and/or packaged 

under airtight conditions. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a reduced pressure is maintained above the liquid in the 

chamber (1). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the liquid is essentially water and the airtight removal 

takes place into sealable reservoirs or tanks. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the liquid is a liquid which sets or is capable of setting 

and removal takes place in a manner such that shaped compacts 
are formed. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the liquid contains cement. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the liquid contains bitumen. 
Installation for carrying out the method according 
to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that 

said installation comprises a closed container (1) having an 
inlet opening provided with an automatic seal or air lock, a 

grinding or crushing device close to the inlet opening, and a 
discharge conveyor which runs from the base of the container to 

or through the discharge opening in a manner such that it is 
isolated from the outside air. 
Installation according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the container has a liquid feed above the level of the 

 
liquid in order to maintain the level in the container. 
Installation according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the container is connected, above the 

level of the liquid, to a suction box provided with a filter. 
Installation according to Claim 7, 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the inlet and/or outlet have a funnel 

mouth, located inside or outside the container, into which the 
liquid level of the liquid in the container extends to a height 

such that ingress of air via the inlet or outlet can not occur. 
Installation according to one or more of the 
preceding Claims 7 to 10, characterised in that the discharge 

conveyor is a screw conveyor which extends from the lower end 
via a funnel-shaped base through a pipe forming the outlet. 
Installation according to one or more of Claims 7 
to 11, characterised in that the container has side walls which 

have razor-sharp bottom edges (17), a mouth (19), the top of 
which is located at a higher level and is provided with a seal 

(20), and a sealed rear edge (21, 22). 
Installation according to Claim 12, characterised 
in that the height of the grinding or crushing device is 

adjustable.
