<ABSTRACT>
Water in a process water system, such as a cooling tower or pulp and paper processing plant, is treated to destroy biological microorganisms by diverting the portion of the water flowing through the system to a side stream. In the side stream, chemicals are added such as halide ions or sodium chlorite. The water is then passed through an electrolysis unit or a UV radiation unit to oxidize the precursor to form an active oxidant. Advantageously, the pH of the side stream can be lowered to significantly improve the oxidization of the halide ions. When a very small portion of the flow rate is passing through the side stream, the acid added does not significantly alter the pH of the entire system. In a preferred embodiment, the acid added is phosphonic acid which acts as an antiscalant. Also included in the present invention is a method to inject oxidant precursors into a process water system through an oxidant generation station.

<DESCRIPTION>
Virtually all open water systems have 
problems with microorganisms such as bacteria and 
algae, and various treatments are used to eliminate 
the microorganisms. For example, in swimming pools it 
is common to add a source of chlorine to destroy 
microorganisms. Other water systems employ additional 
biocides and algicides. It is very common to add 
chlorine or ozone or other chemicals to drinking water 
to destroy microorganisms. Environmental and health regulations have 
generally insured that chemical treatments are safe. 
However, due to increased sensitivity to environmental 
concerns, philosophically it is preferable to minimize 
or eliminate the use of chemicals for treatment of 
water, particularly where the water is either consumed 
or discharged into the environment. One particular method of destroying microorganisms 
is ultraviolet irradiation. At approximately 
254 nanometers, ultraviolet radiation will destroy 
most microorganisms. Ultraviolet irradiation is used  
 
to treat potable water. It has also been used to 
treat swimming pools. Electrolytic treatment of brine solution is 
used to generate hypohalite species which is added to 
waste water to destroy microorganisms. Cooling towers and similar water systems 
require a sophisticated combination of chemical 
treatments to overcome a variety of problems. 
Antiscalants, bactericides, and other chemicals must 
be added to the cooling tower water. High intensity 
ultraviolet irradiation can cause a breakdown of 
certain chemicals. Also, with a system such as a 
cooling tower, algae tends to grow on the portion of 
the system which is exposed to the environment. There 
is no good way to expose this surface to ultraviolet 
radiation to prevent algae growth. Other microorganisms 
also grow on areas such as heat exchangers 
which are totally inaccessible. Therefore, some 
biocide or algicide is required. Also, in cooling towers, the heat generated 
by the ultraviolet light source is prone to cause 
scale formation on the U.V. lamp particularly with 
medium pressure lamps. This is in part due to the 
temperature, alkalinity and total hardness of the 
water. Turbity also interferes with U.V. light 
transmission. For these reasons, ultraviolet 
radiation has not been used to destroy microorganisms 
in open water systems.  
 Accordingly, it is an aim of the present 
invention to provide a method of treating water in a 
water system such as cooling towers which reduces the 
need to add typical chemical biocides and algicides 
and permits the use
