<ABSTRACT>
A steering column lock, for application to a motor vehicle, 
has a steering shaft (2), a locking element in the form of a 

sleeve (12) engageable with the shaft; a latch device (18,19) 
moveable to a locked position in which the locking sleeve (12) 

is engaged to be prevented from rotation with the shaft, and 
drive means provided between the sleeve (12) and shaft (2) 

comprising intermeshing surfaces urged into engagement by 
resilient means (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steering column lock, in
particular for application to a motor vehicle.Conventionally, a steering column lock includes a locking
mechanism in which a locking bolt is spring-biased towards a
steering shaft on removal of an operating key for the vehicle.
One or more slots or detents are formed in the shaft or in a
collar fixed around the shaft so that rotation of the locking
shaft allows the locking bolt to snap into a slot or detent on
appropriate alignment. Thereafter, the steering shaft and
steering wheel cannot be rotated, making the vehicle unsteerable,
and helping to prevent theft of the vehicle.A problem with this lock is that it is possible to break the
lock through application of a destructively high torque through
the steering wheel, such as can be applied if an implement which
allows excessive leverage to be exerted on the steering wheel is
employed. Such abuse generally causes failure of the body of the
locking mechanism or the locking bolt, or the slot in the
steering shaft. Present regulations require such devices to be
able to withstand application of a torque of at least 200 Nm
before failure of the lock. However, this represents a torque
which can be relatively easily applied by a suitably equipped car
thief.FR-A-2161392 discloses a steering column lock having the
features of the preamble of claim 1.The present invention seeks to provide a steering column 
lock which cannot be destroyed by application of a high torque
through the steering wheel.According to the present invention there is provided a
steering column lock, comprising: a steering shaft having a
collar portion; a sleeve disposed about said shaft and arranged
to be engageable with said shaft for rotation therewith through
drive means; a latch device movable between a locked position in
which said sleeve is engaged so as to be prevented from being
rotated with said shaft, and an unlocked position in which said
sleeve is not so engaged; wherein said drive means comprise
intermeshing camming surfaces formed on said sleeve and on said
shaft, and resilient means to urge said intermeshing camming
surfaces into engagement with each other, whereby, when said
latch device is in the locked position, on application of a
torque exceeding a predetermined value said intermeshing camming
surfaces cam over each other against the force of said resilient
means; characterized in that said intermeshing camming surfaces
comprise a plurality of balls or radially disposed cylindrical
rollers seated in respective

A steering column lock, comprising:

a steering shaft (2) having a collar portion (10);
a sleeve (12) disposed about said shaft (2) and arranged to
be engageable with said shaft (2) for rotation therewith through

drive means;
a latch device movable between a locked position in which
said sleeve (12) is engaged so as to be prevented from being

rotated with said shaft (2), and an unlocked position in which
said sleeve (12) is not so engaged;

   wherein said drive means comprise intermeshing camming
surfaces (11, 13) formed on said sleeve (12) and on said shaft

(2), and resilient means (14) to urge said intermeshing camming
surfaces (11, 13) into engagement with each other, whereby, when

said latch device is in the locked position, on application of
a torque exceeding a predetermined value said intermeshing

camming surfaces (11, 13) cam over each other against the force
of said resilient means (14);

   characterized in that said intermeshing camming surfaces
(11, 13) comprise a plurality of balls (20) or radially disposed

cylindrical rollers (26) seated in respective seats (22, 28),
each formed in part at an end surface of said sleeve (12) and in

a surface of said collar portion (10) which faces said end
surface of said sleeve (12).
A steering column lock according to claim 1, wherein said
intermeshing camming surfaces (11, 13) provide a plurality of

angularly spaced relative positions in which they are fully
meshed, whereby, on application of a torque exceeding the

predetermined value said shaft (2) jumps between the spaced fully 
meshed positions.
A steering column lock according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
said sleeve (12) is formed with one or more slots (17) therein,

and said latch device includes a locking bolt (19) extendable in
the locking position into a slot (17), and retracted from said

slot (17) in the unlocked position.
A steering column lock according to any one of claims 1 to
3, wherein said resilient means (14) comprises a spring disposed

about said shaft (2), a first end of which axially abuts said
sleeve (12), and the opposite end of which abuts a bearing for

said shaft (2).
A steering column lock according to any one of claims 1 to
4, wherein said resilient means (14) and intermeshing camming

surfaces (11, 13) are arranged so that when said latch device is
in the locking position disengagement between said shaft (2) and

said sleeve (12) occurs at above a torque of about 45 Nm.
