<ABSTRACT>
A weighing device for rail vehicles, comprising: a transverse beam formed as a cross-tie, which provides the underlying support for a rail pair fastened to the crossbeam; a load cell (21) for each rail (3), which load cell is placed between the rail and the transverse beam and is of a type which has a substantial load receiving surface and an insubstantial height and is lateral load insensitive, the load cells preferably being of the sort having a pressure registering fluid (23) disposed in the form of a thin layer between two parallel plates; means (19, 31, 33, 35) to controllably pre-bias the load cells (21); and means to evaluate the output signals from the load cells. The load cells (21) and associated fluid pressure controlled pre-bias units (19) are placed in the rail anchor plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the weighing 
of a vehicle which runs on a track, i.e. a rail vehicle 
such as a goods wagon. The invention relates in particular 
to a device enabling dynamic weighing. There has long been a substantial need for devices 
enabling the weighing of rail vehicles such as goods 
wagons with the necessary accuracy, especially in 
connection with industrial consignments and marshalling. 
As will be appreciated without further elaboration, it is 
preferable to be able to weigh dynamically, i.e. while the 
rail vehicle is in motion on a railway or other track. There have been attempts to construct weighing devices for 
the above field of application but the resulting 
constructions have been very complex, expensive and 
required extensive installation work, usually without 
providing the desired accuracy at least in relation to 
dynamic weighing. A weighing device according to the pre-characterising part of claim 
1 is known from EP-A-0 468 397. The objects of the present invention are to provide a 
weighing device which is simple, easy to install without 
substantial interference with the rail system, preferably 
very cheap and which provides accurate weighing results, 
even on a rail vehicle passing over the device at a 
relatively high velocity.  
 The above objects are attained in a device which exhibits 
the features defined in the accompanying claim 1. The device of the invention is thus based upon the insight 
that load cells of a particular design can provide evaluation 
amenable measurement signals if the load cells are 
placed under each rail in a rail pair against an underlying 
transverse beam, which is conveniently shaped as a 
cross-tie or sleeper, the rails being fastened in conventional 
fashion to the transverse beam. The latter can take 
the form of an ordinary cross-tie or sleeper in the rail 
system although of course a transverse beam specifically 
configured for load cell installation can be used. In the 
latter case, this special transverse beam advantageously 
replaces an ordinary cross-tie or sleeper. The load cell is of a type having a substantial load 
receiving surface and an insubstantial height and is 
substantially insensitive to lateral load. Preferably, a 
pressure detecting fluid is disposed in the form of a thin 
layer between two steel plates which are best circular. The load cells are advantageously of the type described in 
EP 0 342 305 B1 to which reference is made in relation to 
the details of a preferred load cell. In

<CLAIMS>
A weighing device for rail mounted vehicles, 
in particular goods wagons, 

comprising 

a transverse beam (5) formed as a cross-tie or sleeper 
which provides the underlying support for a rail pair (3, 

4) fastened to the transverse beam, 
a load cell (9,21) for each rail, the respective load cells 
being placed between the associated rail (3, 4) and the 

transverse beam (5) and being of a type which has a substantial 
load receiving surface and an insubstantial 

height and is lateral load insensitive, the load cells 
preferably being of the sort which has a pressure detecting 

fluid disposed in the form of a thin layer (13) 
between two parallel plates, 
 
characterized by further comprising 


means (19, 31, 33, 35) to controllably pre-bias the load 
cells in order to compensate for loading fluctuations 

in connection with the passage of wheel pairs (1) 
onto and away from the device, and for calibration and 

readjustment, and 
means (13) for evaluating the output signals of the load 
cells. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the respective load cells (9,21) are arranged in a mounting 

plate (7) which is simultaneously a rail anchor plate. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said means (19, 31, 33, 35) to controllably pre-bias 

the load cells are disposed between the load cells (9,21) and 
the transverse beam (5).  

 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said means (19, 31 33, 35) to 

controllably pre-bias the load cells (9,21) are fluid 
pressure controlled. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the transverse beam (5) constitutes 

an ordinary cross-tie or sleeper in the rail system. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the rails (3, 4) are supported, 

movably and elastically dampened, on the load cells. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the load cells (9,21) have a circular 

configuration with a load receiving surface diameter to 
height ratio of at least about 5. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by comprising three parallel, spaced 

transverse beam-load cell arrangements (5, 7, 9) connected 
to said evaluation means (13), the distance between the 

two outer arrangements exceeding the interaxle distance of 
a bogie. 
A device according claim 8, characterized in that the 
three arrangements (5, 7, 9) each constitute an ordinary 

cross-tie or sleeper and are disposed with an ordinary 
cross-tie or sleeper interposed between the first and 

second arrangements and between the second and third 
arrangements.
