<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to inflate easily a tyre mounted on a wheel rim with a sealing ring (6) located between the two beads, without having the usual drawbacks of fitting, the inflation device is formed of a valve (V, V') equipped with a locking element (2, 2') intended to be associated with a locking member (83, 51) outside the valve. The inflation method consists then in inserting the valve (V, V') equipped with its stem (1, 1') and with its locking element (2, 2') into the orifice (64) provided in the ring (6) and in the locking member (83, 51), then in rotating the valve V.

A device for the inflation of a tyre mounted 
on a rim (J) having several parts (80, 81, 82) and a 

flat base (80) provided with a passage opening (83) for 
a valve (V, V'), with a sealing ring (6) arranged 

between the inner walls of the beads of the tyre, said 
ring (6) being provided with a cylindrical orifice (64) 

of diameter ⊘ intended to be arranged to coincide with 
the opening (83), said device comprising at least an 

inflation valve (V, V') and an attachment means for 
said valve, characterised in that said valve (V, V') 

comprises a rectilinear stem (1, 1') of a diameter ⊘1, 
⊘'1 which is between 1.2 and 2.0 ⊘ and intended to 

penetrate by force into the orifice (64) of the ring 
(6), said stem being provided, at a distance λ from its 

end (11, 11') which is at least equal to the length of 
the orifice (64), with a male locking element (2, 2') 

intended to cooperate with a female locking element 
(83, 51) external to the valve (V, V'), the stem (1, 

1') of said valve (V, V') being extended on the other 
side of the element (2, 2') by a threaded bent stem 

(3). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the male locking element (2) of the valve (V) is 

a metal plate having four sides, two of which are 
rectilinear and parallel and spaced apart by a distance 

less than the width of the valve opening and the length 
of which is greater than the width of said opening, the 

locking member external to the valve being the passage 
opening (83) for the valve (V). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the locking element (2) of the valve (V') is 

formed of two spurs and in that the locking member  
 

external to the valve (V') is a metal washer (51) 
having a central circular orifice (53) provided with 

two diametrically opposed notches (56). 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the metal washer (51) is housed in a cavity 

(63, 630) provided for this purpose on the radially 
inner face of the sealing ring (6). 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the metal washer (51) is an integral part of 

the sealing ring (6). 
A device according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the metal washer (51) is covered radially on 

the inside and outside by two backing reinforcements 
(71, 72) in the form of circular rings and formed of 

textile cords. 
A method of inflating a tyre mounted on a rim 
(J) having several parts (80, 81, 83) and a flat base 

(80), provided with a valve passage opening (83) with a 
sealing ring (6) arranged between the inner walls of 

the beads of the tyre, said ring (6) being provided 
with a cylindrical orifice (64) of diameter ⊘, 

characterised in that, after the mounting the tyre and 
sealing ring (6) on the rim (J), taking care to have 

the orifice (64) of the ring (6) coincide with the 
valve opening (83) of the rim (J), the lubricated stem 

(1, 1') of the valve (V, V') is manually inserted in 
the orifice (64) of the ring (6) in a position such 

that the locking element (2, 2') of the valve (V, V') 
can penetrate through the locking member (83, 51) 

external to the valve, resting against the radially 
inner face (61) of the sealing ring (6) and subjecting 

the locking element (2, 2') of the valve (V, V') to a  
 

rotation of an angle α, the angle α preferably being 
equal to 90°.
