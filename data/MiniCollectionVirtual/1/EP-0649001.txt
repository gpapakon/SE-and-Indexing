<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for measuring the shape and/or the flatness (planarity) of a longitudinal fibre of a moving strip. The altitudes (yi) of a set of n points of rank (i) in the said fibre are measured and a function (y(l)) depending on the shape of the said fibre is determined. When the altitude of the point of rank (i) is measured, the altitudes of at least two other points which are close to it and which are located on either side of it are simultaneously measured, and the curvature (K(x)i) of the said fibre in the vicinity of the said point of rank (i) is approximately calculated, then a function (k(l)) representing the change in the curvature between the said points of rank 1 and of rank n is determined and, by successive integrations (k(l)), a function (Y(l)) representative of the intrinsic shape of the said fibre between the said points of rank 1 and of rank n, and the length L of the said fibre are determined, on the basis of which its degree of extension is calculated. The invention also relates to a device for implementing this method.
