<ABSTRACT>
In a method for atomising liquid fuel (6) in an atomiser nozzle assisted by gaseous media and intended for the operation of gas turbines and atmospheric firing plants, the gaseous auxiliary atomising medium used is flue gas (7), separate feeds being used for the flue gas and the combustion air required after atomisation. The flue gas can also be mixed with steam in any desired ratio. It is possible to use the known designs of steam- and air-assisted and straight-pressure atomiser nozzles for this method if the special properties of flue gas are taken into account in their design.
