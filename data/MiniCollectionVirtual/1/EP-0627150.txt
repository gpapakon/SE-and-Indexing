<ABSTRACT>
A system and a method for enabling a subscriber with a radio terminal (5) to use another terminal (6), which does not belong to his radio terminal subscription, includes an automatic network service enabling for said subscriber to open subscription to said service while storing information concerning said radio terminal subscription in said network (2). After having become a subscriber to said service the radio terminal subscriber may request use of said service by calling it via the radio terminal (5) while entering the number of said other terminal (6) as well as the number of a destination terminal (310). This results in the subscriber being able to communicate from said other terminal to said destination terminal. After use of the service a specified account is charged.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally the invention relates to a method and a system
enabling third party charge at the use of a terminal or a telephone
in a telecommunication network.More particularly, the subject invention relates to a
method and a system enabling a subscriber with a radio
terminal to use another terminal or telephone, which does not
belong to his radio terminal subscription.Examples of such a subscriber is a telephone subscriber,
who has a mobile telephone, and at the same time is a
subscriber in a fixed telecommunication network and wishes to
charge the last mentioned subscription at the use of another
telephone in the network, which does nor belong to this
subscription, e.g. a coin box.A mobile telephone subscriber has normally a subscription
also in the wirebound telephone network. If a wirebound
telephone is available at the location where the subscriber
is located, the subscriber may prefer to use this wirebound
telephone instead of his mobile telephone due to the lower
cost for the call and the higher speech quality or just to
save the batteries of the mobile telephone. For the
subscriber it is then desirable to enable the call to be
charged to the wirebound subscription.The procedure in today's existing networks for charging a
third terminal, or third party charge, is carried out
manually by an operator, involving extra costs and time,
which implies that the function has little interest in the
described situation.The manual procedure for these in Sweden so-called Bt-calls
which should be charged to a third party is as follows.Call an operator on 0018, ask for a Bt-call and state: 
the telephone number from which you wish to call,the requested startup time for the callthe subscription which should be charged.The operator calls the number intended for charging to
get a confirmation that the charge will be accepted. The
operator calls the terminal, from which the call is to be made,
at the requested time and following this the called subscriber
number can be entered.In Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol 8, No 78, E-237 there
is described a system for charging a specific telephone
subscription when the owner of the subscription makes a call
from another subscription in the network. This system cannot
result in an automatic and simplified service to a subscriber
with a radio terminal, which enables the subscriber to request
via this terminal permission to use another terminal or
telephone, which does not belong to his radio terminal
subscription, and to enable the use to be charged to an account
which may be

<CLAIMS>
A method for enabling a subscriber with a radio
terminal (5) to use another terminal (6), which does not

belong to his radio terminal subscription, said method
comprising


the step of providing an automatic network service
enabling for said subscriber to perform the substeps of
opening subscription thereto while filing information
concerning said radio terminal subscription,
requesting use of said service by calling it via said
radio terminal (5) while entering the number of said another

terminal, resulting in the subscriber being able to
communicate from said another terminal (6), and
being charged for the use of said service to a specified
account other than that of the radio terminal subscription.
A method according to claim 1, comprising the step
entering said account before requesting use of said service,

such as at opening subscription thereto.
A method according to claim 2, comprising the step of
entering several accounts in advance and stating a particular

one of these desired to be charged after use of said service
by entering an abbreviated code number, e.g. an extra digit,

assigned to said particular account.
A method according to claim 1, comprising the step of
informing said service of said specified account not until at

requesting use of said service.
A method according to any of claims 1-4, comprising
the step of enabling said another terminal (6) to be located

at an optional distance, which can be nearby or distant, from
said radio terminal (5) when requesting use of said service.
A method according to any of claims 1-4, comprising
enabling for the subscriber, in case said another terminal

(6) is nearby the radio terminal (5), to perform the step of

   requesting use of said service via said radio terminal
(5) while also entering, on the radio terminal, the number of

a further terminal (310) with which said subscriber wishes to 
communicate from said another terminal (6), resulting in the

subscriber being directly connected by said service for
communicating with said further terminal (310) from said

another terminal (6).
A method according to any of claims 1-6, comprising
enabling for the subscriber to perform the step of

   auxiliary signalling (312, 512) via the radio terminal
(5) a message to said service, said message being associated

with a call in progress in which said radio terminal
subscriber participates from said another terminal (6).
A method according to claim 7, further comprising the
step of

   directing said auxiliary signalling (512) to said service
for requesting connection, without necessitating interruption

of the call, of one or more further participants (510) to the
call in progress.
A method according to claim 1, comprising providing
said service to allow said radio terminal subscriber to

perform the steps of

opening subscription on said service in a wirebound
network (2) while storing information concerning the radio

terminal (5) subscription and a wirebound (1) subscription
belonging to the subscriber in said network,
requesting use of said service from said radio terminal
(5) while entering the number of a fixed telephone (6), such

as a coin box, which does not belong to his said wirebound
subscription, and which the subscriber desires to use, and
being charged for the use of said telephone (6) via his
said wirebound (1) subscription.

further comprising the step of assigning to said radio

terminal subscriber at the opening of said service a personal
code, which the subscriber must enter in connection with

requesting said service for communicating from another
terminal (6).

further comprising the step of using, in case the number of 

said another terminal (6) is available in association
therewith as a bar code, a bar code reader associated with

said radio terminal (5) for entering the number of said
another terminal, in the step of requesting use of the

service.

terminal (5) to use another terminal (6), which does not

belong to his radio terminal subscription, comprising

an automatic network service enabling the subscriber to
open subscription thereto while storing information

concerning said radio terminal subscription in the network
(2),

service by calling it via said radio terminal (5) while

entering the number of said another terminal (6), resulting
in the subscriber being able to communicate from said another

terminal,
means enabling the subscriber to be charged for the use
of said service to a specified account other than that of the

radio terminal subscription.

terminal (6) is nearby the radio terminal (5), to enter also

on the radio terminal, when requesting use of said service
via said radio terminal, the number of a further terminal

(310) with which said subscriber wishes to communicate from
said another terminal (6), resulting in the subscriber being

directly connected by said service for communicating with
said further terminal (310) from said another terminal (6).
A system according to any of claims 12-17, comprising
