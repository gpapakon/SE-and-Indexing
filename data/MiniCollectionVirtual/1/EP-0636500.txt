<ABSTRACT>
An insert (10) for a pad holder and the like 
includes a tongue (42) for insertion into an inside 

pocket (36) of a cover (14 or 16) of the pad holder, 
the inside pocket being intended to receive a back (38) 

of a pad of paper (40), and a flap (44) hingedly joined 
to said tongue (42) along an upper edge thereof. The 

flap (44) overlies the inside pocket (36) when the 
tongue (42) is inserted into the pocket (36) and allows 

the back of (36) of the pad of paper (40) to be 
inserted into the pocket along with the tongue (42), 

whereby the pad of paper overlies the flap (44). The 
insert further includes holder means (50) for holding 

and storing articles, the holder means being hingedly 
joined to the flap along a side edge (48) thereof and 

pivotable with respect to the flap, whereby the holder 
means (5?) is also pivotable with respect to the pad of 

paper (40) when the pad of paper is inserted into the 
inside pocket (36). The holder means (50) lies between 

the pad of paper (40) and an opposed cover (14 or 16) 
of the pad holder when the pad of paper (40) is 

inserted into the inside pocket (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inserts for pad holders and 
the like, and in particular to inserts which can be placed in a standard pad 
holder designed to hold a cardboard-backed pad of paper without 
interfering with use of the pad and other standard features of the pad 
holder. Pad holders are staple items of stationery and are widely used 
to carry pads of paper as well as loose papers and other items. As is well 
known, a typical pad holder consists of front and back covers joined by an 
integral hinge. In most cases, the front and back covers are made of a stiff 
cardboard material and are sandwiched between two layers of leather, vinyl, 
cloth or other suitable covering material. The covering material typically extends 
over both the front and back covers, and the portion of covering 
material between the front and back covers forms the integral hinge. A slit 
is usually provided near the top of the inside back cover of sufficient length 
to receive the backer of a pad of paper between the inside back covering 
material and the stiff cardboard of the back cover. Thus, a pad of paper 
may be inserted and retained in the pad holder and removed and replaced 
as desired.  Such pad holders also typically have a flap pocket on the 
inside front cover to hold loose papers and other items such as tickets and 
so forth, and may also have additional small pockets on the outside of the 
flap pocket to hold business cards. A pen or pencil loop is also often 
provided along the inside of the hinge. An advantage of a typical pad holder is that it is fairly light 
and easily carried. A disadvantage of the typical pad holder is that it does 
not have a great capacity for holding much more than a pad of paper and 
a few loose sheets. A typical flap pocket cannot accommodate a large 
number of papers. Moreover, the typical pad holder usually has no room 
to store other items such as a calculator, an appointment book, a personal 
telephone directory, keys, and other items one finds necessary. 
Consequently, the typical pad holder is of limited utility, and one must 
usually also carry a portfolio or briefcase to hold these other items. There is a need for a pad holder insert which can provide 
additional storage in a typical pad holder so as to enable the user to store 
and carry additional items in the pad holder without the need to resort to 
a portfolio or briefcase. Such an insert should preferably be available in a 
number of different configurations to hold a variety of different items, such 
as computer
