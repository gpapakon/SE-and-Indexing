<ABSTRACT>
The method comprises simultaneous addition of acid and aluminate in controlled amounts, optionally in the presence of a water miscible solvent, followed by separation of the supernatant from the precipitate. Hereby impurities are more effectively separated from the enzyme which remains in the supernatant.

<DESCRIPTION>
In order to purify or concentrate an aqueous enzyme solution,
especially an enzymatic fermentation broth, different purification methods are
known in the art. Examples are salting-out and treatment with activated carbon.
However, the selectivity, with which these purification methods separate enzymes
from carbohydrates, non enzymatic proteins, colored compounds, and other
impurities is open to improvement.Thus, the purpose of the invention is the provision of a method for
purification of an aqueous enzyme solution by means of which the enzymes can
be effectively separated from carbohydrates, non enzymatic proteins, colored
compounds, and other impurities. Usual sources of aqueous enzyme solutions
are fermentation broths or filtered fermentation broths.The method for purification of an aqueous enzyme solution according
to the invention is characterized by the fact that a soluble aluminate is added to
the aqueous enzyme solution, and that simultaneously an acid is added in such
amounts that the pH-value of the solution is maintained between 4 and 10 and
that the pH-value differs at least 1 pH unit from the isoelectric point of the enzyme
to be purified, whereby the soluble aluminate is added to the solution in an
amount between a maximum amount, which will precipitate no more than a
negligible amount of enzyme and a minimal amount, which will leave no more
than a negligible amount of impurities, mainly carbohydrates, in solution, and that
the supernatant subsequently is separated from the precipitate, which is
discarded.It has been found that the precipitation process proceeds in the most
efficient manner at lower pH-values. However, most enzymes exhibit low stability
at low pH-values. Thus, a compromise pH-value with a reasonably efficient
process and a reasonably good enzyme stability has to be chosen.According to the invention it surprisingly has been found that the
"window", i.e. the interval of added aluminate, in which practically no enzymes are
precipitated and practically all impurities are precipitated, is larger than for other 
precipitating agents, if the precipitation is carried out by means of the method
according to the invention.It is to be understood that the addition of the soluble aluminate to the
pH-adjusted enzyme solution with subsequent precipitation of aluminum
hydroxide will change the pH, but that according to the invention the pH-value will
be readjusted with formic acid, if the changed pH-value should not fulfil the above
indicated conditions, i.e. if the changed pH-value should
