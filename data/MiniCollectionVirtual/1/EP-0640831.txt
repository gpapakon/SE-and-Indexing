<ABSTRACT>
Method, in particular in radiosondes, for measurement 
of relative humidity by using a capacitive 

humidity detector (10) or a combination of detectors 
(10₁,10₂;10P), as well as humidity detectors. In the 

detector, between the capacitor plates, an insulating 
material (12) is used, whose permittivity is a function 

of the amount of water absorbed by the insulating 
material (12). The detector (10) or the combination 

of detectors is heated in order to remove any 
ice, frost or condensed humidity deposited on the 

face and/or in the environment of the detector. The 
detector capacitance (C
M
) or a part (C₁...C
N
) of 
same is heated, in time and/or in place, periodically 

by means of electric current (I). The detecting of 
the detector capacitance (C
M
) is carried out without 
measurement of the detector temperature after the 

detector capacitance or a part (C₁...C
N
) of same has 
cooled down substantially to the temperature of the 

environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of measuring relative humidity.In the prior art, a number of different electrically detected temperature and humidity
detectors are known whose impedance changes as a function of the quantity to be measured.
Such humidity detectors are known, e.g. from the US Patents Nos. 3,168,829 and 3,350,941
and from the applicant's Finnish Patent No. 48, 229.As is known in the prior art, for measurement of temperature, capacitive detectors are
used, which are usually based on the fact that the permittivity of the insulating material
between the capacitor plates is dependent on the temperature, in which case the capacitance
detected from the terminals of the detector also depends on the temperature.The FI Patent No. 48,229 is related to the prior art concerned in the present
invention, in which patent a capacitive humidity detector is described in which the dielectric
insulating material is a polymer film, whose permittivity is a function of the amount of water
absorbed by the polymer film.In the detectors described above and also in other detectors based on change in
impedance, undesirable phenomena occur, which include freezing and wetting of detectors,
radiation error, slowness of the detectors, and hysteresis.In the applicant's FI Patent No. 58,402, a method is described for reduction of
undesirable properties produced by reversible changes in an electric humidity detector based
on change in impedance, in particular in a capacitive humidity detector, in which the material
sensitive to humidity is an organic polymer, which is heated, at least with higher humidities,
to a temperature higher than the temperature in the environment of the humidity detector. If
necessary, the heating power of the detector can be regulated as a function of the humidity to
be measured. In said FI patent, the temperature of the humidity detector and/or the outside
temperature is/are measured, and this or these auxiliary quantities are utilized in the
computing of the humidity measurement values. In said FI patent it is stated that the heating
of the detector can be switched off for the time of the measurement, but it is not stated more
specifically in what way and for what purpose this switching-off takes place. In any case, in
said FI Patent 58,402, measurement of the temperature of the detector is always required, and
the measurement result is corrected on the basis of said measurement of temperature because, 
owing to its raised temperature, the detector "shows" an excessively low value of relative
humi
