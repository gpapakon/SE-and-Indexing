<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists in an internal combustion 
engine (or gas engine) shaped by an internal profiled 

static ring where run blades (or segmants) drived by a 
central rotor connected by a slip fit. 
 
The lateral surfaces of the ring are connected to 
seal flanges where the driving shaft connected to the 

central rotor comes through. 
 
During rotation, the blades provide for volume 
variation necessary to absolve the strokes: i.e. 

inlet, compression, firing and exhaust. 
Figure 1 of the attached drawing showes how it 
works. 
The applications fields are all those where it is 
possible to employ a gas engine, for example: motor 

car, aero-engine, naval, agricultural industries, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
At the moment, the technics disposes of internal 
combustion engine as: gas turbine, pistone engine (Otto 
or Diesel) and rotating engine (Wankel). These kinds of engines have reached such a 
perfection through the years that any further effort to 
improve them could be uneconomical compared whith the 
new efficiency obtained. The advantages of the invention are: 
1- more power at the same cubic capacity2- low ratio weight/power 3- less volume 4- low production cost The invention is shown in the attached figures. 
Figures, 1 through 7, represent the working strokes of 
the engine. By these crossing sections, the shape 
proposed is the preferred design, but it could also be 
a different one. The engine we are talking about can have one or 
more stages connected between each other. The following description is refererred to one  
 
stage only in order to show its items and how the 
engine works. The figure 1, of the attached drawings, shows a 
schematic crossing section where the ring 15 is static 
and his internal surfaces is shaped and the central 
rotor 10 runs around the axis 6. The couple of blades 
12 and 13 have a radial motion inside the rotor and the 
end seal of blades describe the internal shape of the 
ring 15 during rotation. The blades are pushed to contact the internal 
shape of the ring 15 by a radial pressure. The pressure can be: pneumatic, hydraulics, 
mechanical or of a different kind. At a given R.P.M. the centrifugal thrust could be 
sufficient to ensure the sealing of blades to the 
profile of ring 15 without requiring any additional 
pressure. The number of blades is not binding, it fixes the 
shape of the inner ring surface which permits the 
working strokes of the engine. The working strokes of the engine are: inlet, 
compression, firing and exhaust.The following description is referred to the 
running of the segment marked by the arrow showing the 
rotation direction. The figure 2 shows the beginning of the inlet 
stroke (see arrow F).The exhaust hole is sealed from the inlet hole by 
a seal 17 which is loaded on the rotor by the spring 
18. Any different energy may be employed. The inlet of gases is realized during the rotation 
of the rotor 10 in direction of arrow F. The volume variation is defined by the external 
diameter of rotor, by the internal profile of ring 15 
and the left lateral surface of blade 12.Gases comes through the inlet hole 1 (see arrow) 
that is on the sealing lateral flanges fixed at the 
lateral surfaces of the ring 15.The inlet holes and the exhaust

1) Gas engine with rotating blades based on a new 
working principle. 
2) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claim, based on the fact that the new working way is 

that the volume change, necessary to develope the 
engine strokes, is obtained by slide blades (12,13) 

located in a central rotor (10) and sliding on a 
special shaped stator (15).
3) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the inlet and 

compression stroke could be done by an external 
fastener and flowing the gases in the engine we are 

talking about. 
4) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the parts configuration 

is not binding. 
5) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the rotating direction 

is not binding. 
6) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the position of the 

inlet and exhaust holes (1,14) is not binding. 
7) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the position of the 

spark plug (9) is not binding. 
8) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
 

claims, based on the fact that the presence of the 
spark plug (9) is not binding if the compression ratio 

is so much to allow a self ignition (like Diesel 
engine). 
9) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the load done by the 

blades (12,13) on the shaped surface of the stator (15) 
to assure the correct sealing can be applied 

pneumatically, hydraucally or in any other way. 
10) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the load done by the 

blades (13,13) on the shaped surface of the stator (15) 
to assure the correct sealing could be generated by 

centrifugal load only during the rotor (10) rotation. 
11) Gas engine with rotating blades, like as previous 
claims, based on the fact that the seal between the 

inlet and exhaust hole (1,14) can be realized in any 
technical way and could also be not necessary.

claims, based on the fact that the relieve piston (7)
