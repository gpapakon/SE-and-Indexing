<ABSTRACT>
An erection walkway for conveying loads and persons at buildings to be reconstructed or redeveloped comprises a walkway which is rotatably held on the cage (12) via a ball slewing ring (13). A second walkway part (19) is held on the rotatable walkway part (14) in such a way as to be displaceable in the longitudinal direction. At its free end, the second walkway part (19) carries a third erection-walkway part (25) which can be swung out about a horizontal axis. By these measures, the working range of the erection walkway is extended by the walkway, and the working position at the end of the walkway can be adjusted continuously.
