<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light 
emitting diode (hereinafter referred to as LED) 
aggregate module and a method for manufacturing an LED 
aggregate module. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an LED aggregate module which 
includes a printed circuit board on which LED chips are 
mounted, and lens sections made of translucent resin 
each of which is disposed in correspondence to each LED 
chip, and a method for manufacturing the LED aggregate 
module. From the past, an n x n matrix type LED 
aggregate module or 1 x n line type LED aggregate 
module, both LED aggregate module including a printed  
 
circuit board on which LED chips are mounted and a lens 
board having plural lenses which lens board is stuck to 
the printed circuit board with adhesive agent and the 
like, for example, are known as LED aggregate modules. When the LED aggregate module having the above-mentioned 
arrangement is manufactured, after mounting 
the LED chips and electronic parts on the printed 
circuit board, the lens board is stuck to the printed 
circuit board by interposing the adhesive agent and the 
like therebetween. Therefore, bubbles are highly 
possible to be contained in an adhesive layer made of 
the adhesive agent and the like. Further, a special 
matching operation is necessary, of optical axes of 
light emitting sections each section has the LED chip as 
a main portion and of the lens sections of the lens 
board, when the lens board is stuck to the printed 
circuit board. Therefore, sticking operation requires 
much labor, and it is raised its possibility that 
matching of optical axes is not performed with 
sufficiently high accuracy. Furthermore, the lens board 
is resin shrinked after the forming thereof. Therefore, 
warp is generated in the LED aggregate module based upon 
a difference between thermal expansion of the printed 
circuit board and thermal expansion of the lens board, 
when the lens board is stuck to the printed circuit  
 
board. To eliminate the disadvantages above-mentioned, 
a method for manufacturing an LED aggregate module is 
thought, to omit sticking of the lens board using the 
adhesive agent and the like by mounting the LED chips 
and electric parts on the printed circuit board, 
thereafter forming the lens board by insert molding in 
which the printed circuit board is set in a die having 
lens cavities each corresponding to each LED chip, and 
molten resin is inserted in the die. When the LED aggregate module is manufactured 
using the method above-mentioned, the
