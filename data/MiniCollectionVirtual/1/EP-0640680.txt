<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a two-stroke engine oil which 
comprises polybutene base oils which are either very low in or are 

substantially free of n-butenes in the polymer backbone. The 
absence of n-butenes in the polybutenes significantly reduces smoke 

emission in exhaust gases generated by the use of the engine oil. 
Polybutenes such as ULTRAVIS® which are substantially free of 

chlorine and have a high degree of terminal unsaturation are 
particularly preferred.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to two-stroke oils which comprise polybutene base oils which are either very
low in or substantially free of n-butenes in the polymer backbone.Two-stroke engine oils are usually lubricating compositions which are used in admixture with a fuel and lubricate
the moving parts of two-stroke engines. Such engines may include outboard engines with a power higher than
50 hp and rising upto 100 hp, air-cooled engines which may not only be used in motorcycles but also, for example, in
chain-saws, skidoos or snowmobiles. A feature of these engines is their high speed of rotation and as a result they
are hotter than engines used hitherto.Initially, the principle requirement of a lubricant for such an engine was for it to be able to form a stable and
continuous film of oil on the affected parts not only at low temperatures to facilitate start-up but also at relatively higher
operating temperatures in order to avoid fouling by the formation of deposits on engine parts which in turn could reduce
performance of the engine or cause damage to the affected parts.More recently, the focus has been on oils which are environmentally friendly, ie the exhaust gases resulting
from the combustion of the fuel and lubricant are clean, have minimum odour, do not give out visible smoke and, in
addition, have reduced oil/fuel ratios.Polybutenes have been used for many years as components in two-stroke oils where, they give advantages
over mineral oils in that they emit low visible exhaust smoke and result in low carbon deposit formation in the engine
exhaust system. GB-A-1287579 (The British Petroleum Co Ltd) applied for in 1968 describes, for instance, the use of
polyisobutylene polymer as a lubricant. However, typically, this specification does not give any method of manufacture
of the poly(iso)butene nor indeed the source of C4 feedstock used as raw-material to produce these polyisobutylenes.
It is well known that poly(iso)butenes used hitherto have invariably been produced from a mixture of butenes including
n-butenes and isobutene eg from a feedstock which is primarily butadiene raffinate or a crude C4 stream from a fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC) process and contains from 20-40% n-butenes. That was the case around the time of application
of GB-A-1287579 as is apparent from GB-A-1340804 (Labofina SA, applied for in 1972) which describes the polymers
as being manufactured from fractions containing hydrocarbons with 4 carbon atoms and the polymers produced therefrom
are said to contain polybutylene and
