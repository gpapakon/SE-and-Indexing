<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct current
(hereinafter abbreviated to DC) oil-filled self contained
(hereinafter abbreviated to OF) cable used as a long power
cable, particularly a long distance submarine power cable,
for large electric power transmission.Heretofore, oil immersed solid power cables, or
mass-impregnated non-draining (MIND) cables and OF cables
have been adaptable as DC cables. In the case of DC OF
cables, kraft paper with high impermeability which is
excellent in breakdown strength is often used, because such
dielectric characteristics as permittivity or dielectric
tangent are, unlike alternating current (hereinafter
abbreviated to AC) cables, not significant to DC cables.
They are otherwise not much different from AC cables in
basic structure. A cable as stated in the preamble
of claim 1 is known from GB-A-1185474.DC Cables must have (1) sufficient DC
withstanding characteristics, (2) sufficient withstanding
characteristics against such abnormal voltages as
lightening surge etc. and (3) sufficient withstanding
characteristics against polarity reversal, and moreover 
satisfy the required carrying capacity.DC stress distribution in insulation is
determined by the ρ-characteristic of the insulation. This ρ-characteristic
in turn varies with temperature and stress.
It undergoes a complex change, as the temperature
distribution in the insulation changes.As far as the conventional DC cables in use with
the kraft paper insulation are concerned, the DC stress
distribution determined by the aforementioned ρ
characteristic is not the prominent factor of design, but
these cables have been designed on a basis of impulse
design as with AC cables, more particularly, on a basis of
the electric stress which will develop when an impulse with
opposite polarity superposed onto DC is applied on the
conductor.For discussions on DC cables for large electric
power transmission, not only impulse strength as in AC
cables but withstand-voltage strength to DC as well are
required. In this case, evaluating the necessary thickness
of insulation would generally result in a large thickness,
detracting from ensuring the required transmission
capacity. As a countermeasure, the conductor resistance
may be reduced by increasing the conductor size, to cut
down its current loss, thereby ensuring the transmission
capacity. But this approach would involve productivity 
reduction, cable size increase, cost rise and other various
problems.The present invention consists in an oil-filled direct
current cable comprising a
