<ABSTRACT>
EPDM compositions comprising EPDM and specified carbon blacks which, when extruded or shaped, exhibit either a highly gloss or a textured matte finish. The carbon black is present in an amount of 100 to about 300, and more preferably about 150 to about 250 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight EPDM.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing EPDM compositions
containing certain carbon blacks which when extruded or shaped
have a high gloss finish.Carbon blacks have been widely utilized as fillers and
reinforcing pigments in the compounding and preparation of
EPDM compositions. Carbon blacks are generally characterized
on the basis of their properties including, but not limited
to, their surface areas, surface chemistry, aggregate sizes,
and particle sizes. The properties of carbon blacks are
analytically determined by tests known to the art, including
iodine adsorption number (I2No.) and dibutyl phthalate
adsorption (DBP).Heretofore generally known carbon black containing EPDM
compositions yield profiles having a dull and flat surface
finish when extruded or shaped. In contrast, a smooth glossy
finish has a high degree of reflectance when viewed at any
angle, in part due to the smooth nature of the surface.
Conversely, a textured matte finish has a low degree of
reflectance due in part to the rugged nature of the surface.
EPDM compositions with high gloss or textured matte finishes
are useful in industrial applications such as automotive
weather stripping.According to the present invention
EPDM compositions were discovered containing certain
carbon blacks that yield profiles having high gloss
finishes when extruded or shaped. The EPDM
compositions comprise ethylene-propylene diene monomer (EPDM) 
and a specified carbon black, which when incorporated into the
EPDM will provide articles having a desired high gloss
finish.The amount of carbon black in the EPDM composition is
such that the EPDM composition will, when extruded or shaped,
yield profiles having a high gloss finish.
The amounts of carbon black utilized range from 100 to
300 parts by weight for each 100 parts by weight of EPDM. It
is, however, preferred to use amounts varying from 150
to 250 parts by weight of carbon black per 100 parts by
weight of EPDM.EPDM is well known and is commercially available from a
variety of sources. The EPDM composition prepared according to the present
invention may be produced by techniques generally known to
those of ordinary skill in the art for mixing rubbers or
polymers and carbon black. As will be understood by those of
ordinary skill in the art the high gloss
finish EPDM compositions prepared according to the present invention are produced
after extruding or otherwise shaping the carbon black-EPDM
mixture.The high gloss finish EPDM compositions
prepared according to the present invention
