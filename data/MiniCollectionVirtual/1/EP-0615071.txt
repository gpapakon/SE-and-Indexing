<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic retaining element 1, having a basic body 2 and an adjoining resilient stop 3, a plurality of in each case mutually opposite resilient latching lugs which are directed, with their end surfaces 6, 6'; 7, 7', towards the resilient plate 3 being integrally formed on said basic body. The basic body is of a cross-sectionally rectangular design and exhibits a release 8 in its interior. Furthermore, the basic body is provided, on all four side surfaces, in each case with diagonally mutually opposite, resilient latching lugs 4, 4'; 5,5'. At least two diagonally mutually opposite latching lugs are each in the form of a T, the transverse web 9 exhibiting the end surface 7 and the vertical web 10 being arranged between two cutouts 11, 12 located in the plane of the side surfaces of the basic body 2, and each latching lug 4, 4'; 5, 5' being surrounded by through-passages 13 which extend as far as the release 8 in the basic body 2.

<CLAIMS>
Plastic retaining element, having a basic body
(2), which has a relieved portion (8) in the interior,

and at least one adjoining elastic stop (3), a plurality
of elastic catch lugs (4, 4'; 5, 5'), which are in each

case opposite one another and are directed with their
end faces towards the stop, being integrally formed on

the basic body (2), each catch lug (4, 4'; 5, 5') being
surrounded by apertures (13) extending up to the

relieved portion (8) in the basic body (2),
characterized in that the basic body (2) is of

rectangular design in cross section, in that the basic
body (2), on all four side faces (A, B, C, D), is

provided in each case with diagonally opposite, elastic
catch lugs (4, 4'; 5, 5') and is thus designed as a

centring cage, and in that at least two diagonally
opposite catch lugs (5, 5') in each case have a T-shape,

the transversely lying web (9, 9') having the end face
(7, 7'), and the perpendicular web (10, 10') being

arranged between two recesses (11, 12; 11', 12') lying
in the plane of the side faces (A, B, C, D) of the basic

body (2).
Retaining element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the stop is designed in an elastic

manner as an encircling spring plate (3).
Retaining element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the basic body (2) is of square

design in cross section.
Retaining element according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that catch lugs (4, 4') which are 

rectangular in front view are integrally formed on two
opposite side faces (A, C) of the basic body (2), and

two T-shaped catch lugs (5, 5') are integrally formed in
the adjoining side faces (B, D).
Retaining element according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the end region (14, 14') of the

rectangular catch lugs (4, 4') is drawn into the
relieved portion (8) relative to the side faces (A, C)

of the basic body (2), and in that the relieved portion
(8) has two diagonally opposite, drawn-in regions (15,

15').
Retaining element according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the end faces

(6, 6'; 7, 7') of the catch lugs (4, 4'; 5, 5') lie in
the same horizontal plane.
Retaining element according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the end faces (6, 6'; 7, 7') of

the catch lugs (4, 4'; 5, 5') lie in at least two
different horizontal planes.
Retaining element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a connecting region (16) for a

mounting, retaining or catch element is arranged above
the elastic stop (3).
Retaining element according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the basic body

(2) is provided with an insertion bevel (17) at the
front end.
