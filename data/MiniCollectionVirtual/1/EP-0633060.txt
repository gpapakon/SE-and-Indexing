<ABSTRACT>
This gas-liquid reaction apparatus comprises a leakproof and pressure-resistant container (1), a rotary stirring device (3) ensuring the production of gas-liquid contact, and a heat exchanger device. This heat exchanger device consists of a set of plates (4) arranged vertically around the stirring device and so as to form an angle between 0 and 70 DEG  relative to the radius in the direction of rotation of the stirring device, a heating fluid circulating inside these plates.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for carrying out gas - liquid reactions including a 
sealed pressure resistant vessel, a rotatory stirring device for ensuring 

the gas - liquid contact and a heat exchanger device, characterized 
in that this heat exchanger device is formed by an assembly of plates 

arranged approximately vertically around the stirring device and in 
such a manner as to form an angle comprised between 0 and 70Â° relative 

to the radius, in the direction of rotation of the stirring device and 
in that a thermal fluid circulates inside these plates. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the plates 
exhibit a non smooth surface and in that they are flat, folded or curved 

in the direction of rotation of the stirring device. 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that 
said vessel is cylindrical and said plates are fastened by their upper 

part at least to one manifold provided for the introduction and the 
evacuation of the thermal fluid, in such a manner that their lateral 

end edges be located in the vicinity of the internal wall of the 
vessel. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the heat exchanger device includes intermediate plates placed 

between said plates and presenting a lower surface thereto. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the stirring device includes a hollow rotatory shaft having in its 

upper part openings for the intake of gas and a gassing turbine, which 
gassing turbine includes an inlet for the liquid in its lower part.  

 
An apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the stirring 
device further includes one or several circulation promoting devices 

integral with the rotatory hollow shaft. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that it includes a sealed chamber in the upper part of the vessel. 
An apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that said sealed 
chamber is situated at the level of the intake openings provided in 

the hollow shaft of the stirring device.
