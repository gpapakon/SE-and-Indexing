<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dry toners for electrophotography comprising
resin, coloring matter, and a charge control agent. This invention employs a
novel mixture of dyes as the charge control agent.Chromium complex dyes are widely known as a class of materials
useful as charge control agents in dry toner corresponding to this invention.
U.S. Patent 4,401,741 to Miyakawa is illustrative. Commercial suppliers offer
various chromium complex dyes explicitly for use as such charge control
agents, but none are known to be so offered which are closely similar to
either of the dyes used together in accordance with this invention.The Material Safety Data Sheet for the IBM 3812 and 3816 toners
includes a dye as the apparent charge control agent as follows: Azoid dye,
CAS No. 41741-86-0. BASF offers commercially a dye with this CAS No.
41741-86-0. It is called Zapon Yellow 156™. (Zapon is a registered
trademark.) The Material Safety Data Sheet for Zapon Yellow 156™ states that
both Solvent Yellow 21 and C.I. 18690 are synonyms to Zapon Yellow 156™.
The Colour Index gives the following description of C.I. 18690: A chromium
complex of 

Anthranilic acid->3-methyl-1-phenyl-5-pyrazolone, (meaning the acid is first
diazotized and then coupled with the pyrazolone).Nevertheless, attempted use of Zapon Yellow 156™ in toners formulated
otherwise in accordance with this invention was not successful.This invention employs a mixture of Solvent Yellow 81 dye and Solvent
Orange 56 dye, sold as Zapon Yellow 141™. The following two references are
known only from database summaries in English. The first mentions Solvent
Yellow 81 and the other mentions Solvent Orange 56 as dyes in toner, but
not as general purpose charge control agents and not in combination:
Japanese patent JP3094270-A issued April 19, 1991, to Ricoh KK and
Japanese patent JP62024268-A issued February 2, 1987, to Ricoh KK. A dry resin toner having Zapon Yellow 141™ as a charge control agent,
dispersed moderately in the toner. Zapon Yellow 141™ is about 95% by weight
Solvent Yellow 81 and about 5% by weight, Solvent Orange 56. Extreme
mixing impairs the functioning this charge control agent. The preferred range
of Zapon Yellow 141™ is 0.25% to 0.75% by weight of total toner.Zapon Yellow 141™ is a commercial product of BASF Corporation
(Chemicals Division 100 Cherry Hill Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054).
According to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), its CAS No. is
"proprietary". However, it does state on the MSDS:Mixture of Solvent Yellow 81, similar to

resin of said toner is styrene/acrylic copolymer.
