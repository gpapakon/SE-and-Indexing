<ABSTRACT>
Tubular casing with a food filling is linked and hung by a rotatable hanging stick having an array of notches or grooves (18) extending along the length of the stick at its perimeter. The grooves (18) are generally V-shaped but the trough has straight parallel sides and a curved bottom. The straight tubular casing is simultaneously gripped and formed or necked into a pigtail by the grooves (18) and links are formed between pigtails. The loaded stick is suitable for hanging in a smoke house.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotatable linking and
hanging device for foodstuffs of the kind comprising a
tubular casing with a food filling. The casing may, for
example, be a collagen casing, a plastic casing, a casing
of animal gut or any other generally tubular food casing.
The food filling may, for example, be sausage-meat or
hamburger meat or may be a non-meat filling such as a
vegetarian filling or a cheese based filling or any other
food filling. The casing may be prefilled with the food
filling or formed by coextrusion with the food filling.An object of the invention is to provide a new and
improved device which hangs a length of tubular casing with
a food filling and renders it suitable for cooking or
smoking in an oven or smoke-house. Devices of this type
are already known as hanging sticks and are used in a smoke
oven to support an array of linked sausages, for example,
in a smoke-filled atmosphere. A typical known form of
hanging stick is disclosed in USA 2780831.According to the present invention there is provided
a winding machine for linking and hanging foodstuffs in the
form of a length or strand of tubular casing with a food
filling, said machine comprising a rotatable hanging stick
having a longitudinal axis around which the stick is
rotatable, the stick having an array of notches or grooves
extending along its length with the array being adjacent
the perimeter of the stick and offset from the longitudinal
axis, each notch or groove in the array being generally V-shaped
and terminating at its trough in a straight-sided
slot which extends generally radially, the arrangement
being such that as the stick is rotated about its
longitudinal axis an unlinked strand is wound around the
stick and the notches or grooves act to simultaneously grip
the strand and form or neck the strand into links which
extend in curves around the stick characterised in that the
machine further comprises a following guide which, as the 
stick rotates, moves along a shaft parallel to but spaced
from the axis of the stick, the following guide including
a pre-portioning device whereby the unlinked strand is
automatically delivered to the stick via the following
guide and the pre-portioning device assists in the
formation of a pigtail or neck between links prior to the
strand reaching the notches or grooves and the links extend
in curves around the stick without a twist having been
imparted to the strand.Thus the winding machine, according to the invention,
simultaneously links and hangs a length of cased sausage 
meat
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A winding machine (30) for linking and hanging
foodstuffs in the form of a length or strand (9) of

tubular casing with a food filling, said machine (30)
comprising a rotatable hanging stick having a

longitudinal axis around which the stick is rotatable,
the stick having an array of notches or grooves (18)

extending along its length with the array being
adjacent the perimeter of the stick and offset from

the longitudinal axis, each notch or groove (18) in
the array being generally V-shaped and terminating at

its trough in a straight-sided slot (16) which extends
generally radially, the arrangement being such that as

the stick is rotated about its longitudinal axis an
unlinked strand (9) is wound around the stick and the

notches or grooves (18) act to simultaneously grip the
strand (9) and form or neck the strand (9) into links

(8) which extend in curves around the stick
characterised in that the machine (30) further

comprises a following guide (34) which, as the stick
rotates, moves along a shaft (35) parallel to but

spaced from the axis of the stick, the following guide
(34) including a pre-portioning device (39) whereby

the unlinked strand (9) is automatically delivered to
the stick via the following guide (34) and the pre-portioning

device (39) assists in the formation of a
pigtail or neck (7) between links (8) prior to the

strand (9) reaching the notches or grooves (18) and
the links (8) extend in curves around the stick

without a twist having been imparted to the strand
(9).
A machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the stick
further comprises at least one smooth-surfaced spacer

bar (38) offset from the longitudinal axis and
circumferentially spaced from the array of notches or 

grooves (18) whereby the curved links (8) are ring
shaped.
A machine as claimed in claim 2, wherein the or each
spacer bar (38) is in the form of a curved plate.
A machine as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, wherein
the or each spacer bar (38) is adjustably mounted on

the stick so as to be movable between radially inner
and outer positions, the latter being used when the

stick is being loaded with a length or strand (9) of
filled tubular casing.
A method of linking and hanging foodstuffs in the form
of a tubular casing with a food filling, the method

including the steps of winding a strand of unlinked
tubular casing with a food filling around a hanging

stick having an array of generally V-shaped notches or
grooves extending along its length each notch or

groove acting simultaneously to grip the strand and
form or neck the strand into links which extend in

curves around the stick, characterised in that the
strand is delivered to the V-shaped notches or grooves

without any twist to the strand, and prior to the
strand reaching the notches or grooves the length or

strand is passed through a pre-portioning device to
assist in formation of a pigtail or neck between

links.
A ring shaped food product when produced by the method
of claim 5.
