acid and heat resistances, which is produced 

by a microorganism of the genus 
Bacillus

corn starch under an acidic condition of 

pH 4.0-5.5 at a temperature of 90-110 °C. 
Furthermore glucose can be obtained in 

a high yield by saccharifying corn starch 
with glycoamylase without adjusting the pH 

value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel α-amylase, 
more particularly to a novel α-amylase having excellent 
resistance to acids and heat and which is capable of 
liquefying corn starch under acidic conditions at a pH 
4.0 to 5.5 and a temperature of 90° to 110°C. The 
invention further relates to a process for preparing the 
α-amylase, and to a method for decomposing starch using 
this enzyme. In the preparation of glucose oligosaccharides, from 
starch, the starch first is liquefied with a liquefying 
enzyme (α-amylase) produced by a microorganism belonging 
to the genus Bacillus, and then saccharified with 
glucoamylase produced by a mold belonging to the genus 
Aspergillus or Rhizopus. Starches from sources which 
grow underground, such as starches from potatoes or sweet 
potatoes, can be liquefied with comparative ease. Corn 
starch, which is a major starch source at the present 
time, is more difficult to liquefy. Corn starch can be 
liquefied by a two-stage liquefaction method, in which 
the starch first is partially liquefied and caused to 
swell by reacting it for a short period of time at a high 
temperature of about 135°C, and then further liquefied at  
 
about 90°C, after the addition of α-amylase. Another 
method, which is currently more popular, comprises 
treating corn starch with a heat resistant α-amylase 
produced by a microorganism of Bacillus 
stearothermophilus (K. Ogawa, A. Imanishi, T. Isemura, J. 
Biochem., 67, 65-75 (1970), S. Endoh, J. Fermentation 
Technology, 37, 353, 356 (1959)), Bacillus licheniformis 
(F.J. Morgan, et al, J. Applied Bacteriology, 50, 107-114 
(1981), or R.M. Antrim, et al., Starch, 43, 355 (1991)), 
or Bacillus subtilis (Japanese Patent Laid-open (kokai) 
No. 34117/1983) using an apparatus called a jet cooker at 
pH 6 to 6.5 and a temperature of 103° to 110°C (residence 
time: about 5 minutes), injecting the treated starch, and 
holding it at 90° to 95°C for 1.5 to 2 hours to perform 
the liquefaction. Almost all α-amylases heretofore known have 
exhibited poor acid resistance and have optimum activity 
at pHs between 6 and 9. Therefore, starch liquefaction 
typically has been carried out at a pH in the range of 6 
to 6.5. However, the glucoamylase produced by 
Aspergillus niger, which is used for saccharification of 
the liquefied starch in the manufacture of glucose, has 
an optimum activity at a pH of about 4.5 and an optimum 
temperature of 60°C. Thus, to reconcile these 
conditions, a complicated process must be used which  
 
comprises liquefying
