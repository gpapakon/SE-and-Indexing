<ABSTRACT>
The sensor device is capable of detecting the occurrence of 
a fire and the type of the fire. Th
e sensor device includes a 
detection element (1) made of an organic semiconductor element or 

an inorganic semiconductor element which varies in characteristic 
value (e.g. resistance) in response to both gas produced in a 

flaming-type fire and a smouldering-type fire. The variation in 
resistance caused by gas produced in a flaming-type fire is 

different in polarity from the variation caused by gas produced 
in a smouldering-type fire. The resistance of the detection 

element (1) is extracted by a resistance extractor (11) and then 
fed to a resistance decrease discriminator (12) and a resistance 

increase discriminator (13), whereby a decrease or increase in 
resistance of the detection element (1) is discriminated. An 

information output circuit (14) outputs a predetermined signal 
(Y1, Y2, Y3) depending on the discrimination results provided by 

the discriminators (12, 13), to thereby indicate occurrence of a 
fire (signal Y1) and the type of the fire (signal Y2 or 

signal Y3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sensor device, and more
particularly to a sensor device for detecting
a fire, and
electronic equipment having the sensor device incorporated
therein.A sensor device which has been conventionally used for
detecting a disaster such as a fire or the like includes a heat
sensor, a photoelectric smoke sensor, an ionization-type smoke
sensor, a flame sensor and the like. Such a conventional sensor
device is located at a predetermined position in a room of a
building to constitute a disaster prevention system.In general, fires are classified into a flaming-type fire
and a smouldering-type fire. Unfortunately, the
conventional sensor device fails to be satisfactorily applicable
to both types. For example, it is known, in the art that the
above-described heat sensor, photoelectric smoke sensor,
ionization-type smoke sensor, flame sensor generally exhibit
characteristics as shown in Table 1. 
Type of FireABCDFlaming-Type Fire (Complete Combustion)○XX○Flaming-Type Fire (Incomplete Combustion)○▵○○Smouldering-Type FireX○▵XA---Heat sensor
B---photoelectric smoke sensor
C---Ionization-type smoke sensor
D---Flame sensor○---satisfactory detection
▵---not too satisfactory detection
X---failure in satisfactory detectionMore particularly, the heat sensor and flame sensor each
exhibit a satisfactory detection function with respect to a
flaming-type fire but fail to exhibit a satisfactory detection
function with respect to a smouldering-type fire. The
photoelectric smoke sensor and ionization-type smoke sensor fail
to satisfactorily detect a flaming-type fire of complete
combustion.Thus, when a disaster prevention system is to be constructed
using any of the sensors described above, it is required to
previously investigate the type of a fire which tends to occur in 
the zone in which the sensor is to be located, to thereby select an appropriate sensor.
Thus, when the selected sensor is not suitable for use in the zone, it fails to detect a
fire. Also, when an unexpected fire occurs even if a sensor which is suitably selected
out of the above-described sensors is located in the zone, it fails to detect the fire.Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 011, no. 253 (P-606), is an abstract of
JP-A-62-059834 and discloses a fire detector for an engine. The fire detector has an
oxygen sensor with a first detection element made of n-type semiconductor and a
second detection element made of p-type semiconductor. The output resistances of
the detection elements change in the same direction in response to ignition
