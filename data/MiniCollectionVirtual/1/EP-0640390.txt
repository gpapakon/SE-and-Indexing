of ferritic stainless steel and aluminum are solid state 
metallurgically bonded together forming a composite material 24. 

Such composite material 24 is further rolled to the final foil 
gauge with no heat treatment and then subjected to a thermal

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite material having
corrosion resistance at high temperatures and a method for its
manufacture and, more particularly, to the material and method
for producing a metal foil material for use in catalytic
converters.As well known, exhaust gases discharged from motor vehicles
may contain halogen gases, halogen compounds and lead compounds,
for example, Cl2, Br2, PbCl2, C2H2Cl2, C2H2Br2 etc., besides unburnt
noxious gases including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and the
like, and components or parts made of ferrous base alloy material
for exhaust system of the motor vehicles or the like, for
example, heat exchangers, air ducts, containers, etc., tend to be
subjected to corrosion by the noxious compounds as described
above. Moreover, halogen compounds (e.g. salt) employed for
preventing freezing during cold seasons are liable to enter these
components of ferrous base alloy material, which are then
corroded by the atmosphere containing halogen gas produced when
the halogen compounds are decomposed at high temperatures.It has been known to use metal foil materials as substrates
with an appropriate catalyst coating in place of ceramic material
substrates. Such metal foil material has been made from steel
sheets containing aluminum and also chromium in order to have the
desired corrosion resistance at high temperature. These FeCrAl
alloys, however, are difficult to produce by conventional rolling 
and annealing processes. To overcome the processing
difficulties, it has been suggested, as in EP-A-475 420,
to produce the foil by a rapid solidification
processing method; but such processing is expensive and requires
very precise controls. It has also been suggested to dip the
stainless steel in a molten bath of aluminum or aluminum alloy to
apply melt-plating on the surface of the stainless steel (U.S.
Patents No. 3,907,611, 3,394,659 and 4,079,157). This stainless
steel with the aluminum is then subjected to a heat treatment to
form an alloy layer having Fe and Al as the main components.
Still further, surface layers of aluminum in binder materials, as
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,228,203, have also been suggested.
GB-A-1458997 discloses a method for making a composite
material comprising the steps of providing a multi-layered metallic
substrate, cold bonding the substrate and diffusion heat
treatment at a temperature lower than the melting points of the
metals in the substrate 
However, in all of these applications the control of the
processing parameters is complex and

A method for making a foil substrate
material for catalytic converters comprising the steps

of:

providing a layer of a first material chosen from
the group consisting of chromium containing ferrous

metals and aluminum and aluminum alloys, sandwiching said
layer of first material between first and second layers

of a second material chosen from the group consisting of
chromium containing ferrous metals and aluminum and

aluminum alloys not chosen for the first material,
metallurgically bonding said layers together by reducing

the thickness of said layers thereby forming a multilayer
composite material of said first and second materials,

reducing the thickness of the composite material to the
final desired thickness for the foil substrate material

and heating said composite material at a temperature
between 900°C and 1200°C for a sufficient period of time

to cause diffusion of metal constituents of said layers
throughout the composite thereby providing a uniform

solid solution material for the foil substrate.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein
metallurgical bonding by reducing thickness is effected

by pressure rolling, and reducing thickness to the final
desired thickness is carried out by further pressure

rolling without thermal treatment that would cause 
formation of intermetallic constituents of the first and

second materials.
The method according to claim 2, wherein the
thicknesses of the layers of said first and second

materials are chosen so that the composite formed from
them can be easily pressure rolled to the desired

finished thickness for the foil substrate without a
thermal treatment.
The method according to claim 2, wherein
said first material is a ferritic stainless steel sheet

having an initial thickness of between 0.045 and 0.070 of
an inch (about 1.1 to 1.8 mm) and said second material is

essentially pure Al with each layer having an initial
thickness of between 0.004 and 0.007 of an inch (about

0.1 to 0.18 mm).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein said first material is a ferritic stainless steel

and said second material is aluminum.
The method according to any one of claims 1
to 5, wherein said heating of said composite is carried

out at about or above 1100°C.
The method according to any one of claims 1 
to 6, wherein said time for heating said composite is

between 1 and 60 minutes.
The method according to any one of claims 1
to 7, wherein the chemical composition of the uniform

solid solution material generally is between 18 and 20
wt. percent Cr, at least 5 wt. percent Al and the balance

Fe.

chemical composition further includes a small amount of

rare earth metals.
The method according to claim 9, wherein
said small amount of rare earth metals is between 0.01

and 0.10 wt. percent.
The method according to any one of claims 8
to 10, wherein the chemical composition further includes

a content of S of less than 0.003 wt. percent.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to

at a temperature between 900°C and 1100°C for sufficient
time to form a thin surface layer of an aluminum oxide

whisker network.

ceramic wash coat is applied to said aluminum oxide

whisker network.
A foil substrate material for catalytic
converters made according to the method of any one of
