<ABSTRACT>
A solid phase junction method using a simpler process 
for accurately bonding solid phases without operating in an 

ultra-high vacuum. This method for bonding at least two 
solid members includes a step (A) of forming at least one of 

i) a monomolecular film; and ii) a monomolecular built-up 
film on at least one of the two junction surfaces, a step 

(B) of adhering the members through the junction surfaces, a 
step (C) of applying an electric field to the junction 

surfaces, and, if necessary, a step (D) of heating the 
junction surfaces or a step (E) of irradiating the junction 

surfaces with laser light.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid phase bonding methods
and, more particularly, to a solid phase bonding method of
bonding solid bodies (solid phases) by applying an
insulating monomolecular film or monomolecular built-up film
to the interface of the solid bodies or junction surfaces.Conventionally, bonding of solid phases is ordinarily
made by a method such as one disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Publication No. 56-53886 in which interfaces are
first cleaned by ion bombardment in an ultra-high vacuum or
by other means. Before a contamination due to adsorption
takes place, the surfaces to be bonded are brought into
abutment so that the distance between the bonded surface is
reduced to the interatomic distance.However, this conventional method, necessitating the
operations for cleaning and bonding interfaces in an ultra-high
vacuum atmosphere, entails problems described below.
1) A large-scale processing apparatus for forming an 
ultra-high vacuum atmosphere is required.2) Aligning interfaces in an ultra-high vacuum atmosphere
is difficult.3) The bonding accuracy is unsatisfactory.In view of the above-described problems of the
conventional art, an object of the present invention is to
provide a solid phase bonding method for accurately bonding
solid bodies (solid phases) by a simple process.To achieve this object, according to one aspect of the
present invention, there is provided a method for bonding at
least two solid members, comprising a step (A) of forming a
monomolecular film or a monomolecular built-up film on at
least one of two interfaces, a step (B) of adhering the
members through the interfaces, and a step (C) of applying
an electric field to the interfaces.According to another aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a method for bonding at least two solid
members, comprising a step (A) of forming a monomolecular
film or a monomolecular built-up film on at least one of two
interfaces, a step (B) of adhering the members through the
interfaces, a step (C) of applying an electric field to the
interfaces, and a step (D) of heating the interfaces.According to a further aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method for bonding at least two solid
members, comprising a step (A) of forming a monomolecular
film or a monomolecular built-up film on at least one of two
interfaces, a step (B) of adhering the members through the
interfaces, a step (C) of applying an electric field to the
interfaces, and a step (E) of irradiating the interfaces
with laser light.Fig. 1 is a
