<ABSTRACT>
Before the actual instruction execution, the virtual addresses (VPAD) of all the necessary memory pages are translated and the absolute page addresses (APAD) are temporarily stored in additional registers (AR-Pxy) and declared as valid. The respective register stage for the most significant address bit is used for the validity control in that said stage is set to logic "1" before each instruction execution and is set to logic "0" again by means of the valid page address. If an invalid page address (APAD) is used for the memory access, the respective memory instruction is modified into a NOOP instruction and the memory access is denied. The system can thus transfer to a loop control, consisting of only two machine cycles, when processing successive partial operands which have overlapping prefetch and execute, without any tests for page overrun.

Method for accelerating the execution of array-processing
commands, e.g. memory-memory commands, in data

processing systems that operate on the pipeline
principle, having a command preparation processor (PLU)

for reading commands, calculating addresses and providing
operands, and having a command execution processor (EXU)

for the actual execution of the command in conjunction
with a memory system (MM-SYST) which is subdivided into

pages of equal size and has a double-word spacing for
reading and writing independently of the beginning of an

operand within a double word, a check being made in each
case, within the context of preparing a command using the

length statements for the operands, as to whether it is
necessary to go beyond a page in providing the operand,

and the respective result (PCAR...) being communicated to
the command execution processor (EXU) when the prepared

command is transferred, so that, in the event of going
beyond a page being signalled (PCAR...), the said command

execution processor can perform an address conversion for
any following pages that may be needed before actually

executing the command and can subsequently load any
following pages that are not present, characterized


in that the absolute page addresses (APAD) that are
derived from the virtual page addresses (VPAD) for the

provision of the operands are stored in a first
register (AR-Px1, AR-Px2) and declared as valid,
in that, in the event of going beyond pages being
indicated, the virtual addresses (VPAD) for the 

following pages needed in each case are also
translated, and the corresponding absolute page

addresses (APAD) are stored in further registers (AR-PE1
or AR-PO1, or AR-PE2 or AR-PO2) and declared as

valid,
in that, in the case of each subsequent provision of a
new part operand that is to be introduced in the

context of executing the command, the stored absolute
page address (APAD) that is relevant and declared as

valid is used directly, together with the byte address
(VAD20-31) of the extrapolated virtual memory address

(VAD...), for forming the necessary absolute address
(AAD) and the latter is used to access the memory

system (MM-SYST), whereas, in the case of an invalid
absolute page address (APAD), the memory access is

prevented.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that


the most significant address bit (VADO) of a virtual
address (VAD) which is not decisive for the address is

used as a validity bit (V) for declaring the validity
of the page address (APAD) that is respectively translated

and temporarily stored in the registers (AR-Px1,
AR-Px2) with the address bits (AAD1-19).
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that


the validity bits (V) in the registers (AR-Px1, AR-Px2)
are in each case set to logic "1" before starting the

command execution processor (EXU) for executing a
command provided by the command preparation processor

(PLU), in order to declare the respective register
content as invalid, and are reset again, with reference

to a register, at the time of each transfer of a valid
absolute page address (APAD) into one of the registers

(AR-Pxy).
Method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that


at the time of each memory access, the validity bit (V) 
that is forwarded together with the absolute page

address (APAD) as an address bit (AADO) modifies the
respective access command into a NOOP command if the

said validity bit is set to logic "1".
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized

in that after each start-up phase for the execution of
the command by the command execution processor (EXU),

with reading in advance of the double word (NEXT DW-OP2)
that is needed for the execution of the (n=2)th

part operand from the second operand in the last-but-one
machine cycle, and with reading in advance of the

(n=2)th double word (NEXT DW-OP1) from the first
operand, with simultaneous alignment of the first part

operand already provided from the second operand and
subsequent transfer of the double word previously read

in advance from the second operand into the provision
register (RD2...), in the last machine cycle of the

start-up phase a transition is made into a loop control
(LOOP) consisting of two machine cycles, and
in that in the first machine cycle (EOL1) of the loop
control, beginning with the (n=1) th part operand, in

each case the execution of the command takes place for
the part operands provided and aligned, the next double

word read in advance is transferred from the first
operand into the provision register (RDI) and the next

double word is already read in advance from the second
operand, while in the subsequent, second machine cycle

(ELO2), in each case the next part operand, provided
two machine cycles previously in the provision

registers (RD2-A or RD2-B), of the second operand is
aligned, the next double word (NEXT DW-OP1) is read in

advance from the first operand, and the double word
read in advance from the second operand in the first

machine cycle is taken over into the provision
register.
Method according to Claim 5, characterized

in that in the first machine cycle (EOL1) in each case 
of the loop control (LOOP), monitoring is additionally

carried out to see whether the end of the operand to be
processed has been reached,
in that, in the second machine cycle (EOL2) in each
case, in the event of executing linking commands having

result-dependent further processing, monitoring is
carried out to see whether the abort condition is given

in the linking result previously obtained in the
machine cycle, and
in that, following the processing of the operands or in
the event of the abort condition being present, the

associated indicator (CC) is set and the execution of
the command is thus completed.
Method according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that


the start-up phase for executing the command begins
with a start phase consisting of three machine cycles,
in the 1st cycle, the command parameters (PAR) consisting
of operation code (OP), operand length (L) and

further parameters (e.g. PCAR...), being transferred by
the command preparation processor (PLU) to the command

execution processor (EXU),
in the 2nd cycle, the start address being provided for
the microprogram that controls the execution of the

command, and the absolute page address (APAD) for
reading the first double word of the first operand,

which address is present on the memory address bus (AD-BUS),
and the virtual address (VAD-OP2) for the second

operand, which address is supplied by the command
preparation processor (PLU), being taken over by the

command execution processor (EXU), and
in the third machine cycle, the selected microprogram
for executing the command being started and the virtual

address (VAD-OP1) for the first operand being taken
over by the command preparation processor.
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in
that


in the further course of the start-up phase, firstly 
the virtual address (VAD-OP2) for the 2nd operand is

translated and then, depending on the respective
parameters (PCAR 12=1, OPCOMPL, NREADOP2), the respectively

corresponding µ-program branch is called.
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in
that


in the event of going beyond a page being indicated
(PCAR 12=1), for the operands that are affected by

this, firstly the respective operand end is calculated
and the associated virtual address is translated,

before the 1st double word for the 2nd operand is read,
and, in the event of going beyond the double word

boundary for the necessary 1st part operand of the 2nd
operand, a further double word is read.
Circuit arrangement for accelerating the
execution of array-processing commands, e.g. memory-memory

commands, in data processing systems that operate
on the pipeline principle, having a command preparation

processor (PLU) for reading commands, calculating
addresses and providing operands, and having a command

check being made in each case, within the context of

preparing a command using the length statements for the
operands, as to whether it is necessary to go beyond a

page in providing the operand, and the respective result
(PCAR. . .) being communicated to the command execution

processor (EXU) when the prepared command is transferred,
so that, in the event of going beyond a page being

signalled (PCAR...), the said command execution processor
can perform an address conversion for any following pages

that may be needed before actually executing the command
and can subsequently load any following pages that are

not present, characterized

in that in addition to the two address registers 
(AR-OP1, AR-OP2) for taking over the virtual operand

addresses (VA-OP1, VA-OP2) from the preparation processor
(PLU) and an adder/subtracter mechanism (ADD)

for calculating the respective operand ends and for
writing the virtual address in the address registers in

double-word steps corresponding to the preceding
execution of a command, the address translation unit

(DAT) of the command execution processor (EXU) has, for
each operand, at least two registers (AR-PE1, AR-PO1 or

AR-PE2, AR-PO2) for the temporary storage of the
absolute page addresses (APAD) necessary for executing

the command, and devices for controlling the validity
indicator (V) for the individual absolute page

addresses in the registers, and
in that coupled to the outputs of the registers (AR-PE...,
AR-PO...) for the absolute page address (APAD)

are selection switches (MUX4 to MUX6) which can be set
as a function of the least significant address bit (VAD

19) of the virtual page address (VPAD) and of the
operand select signal (OP-AW2) of the microprogram

controller (µ-ST) of the command execution processor

(EXU), and which enable the respectively necessary
absolute page address (APAD) for the direct driving of

the memory system (MM-SYST) in conjunction with the
respective byte address (VAD20-31) from the associated

address register (AR-OP1 or AR-OP2), and
in that switching devices are connected to the outputs

register stage in the individual registers (AR-Pxy) for 
the temporary storage of the absolute page addresses

(APAD) and
in that, when the command execution processor (EXU) is
started by the microprogram controller (µ-ST), the

register stages in each case serving as a validity
indicator (V) can be set to logic "1", irrespective of

taking over a valid absolute page address (APAD) with a
logic "0" as the most significant address bit (AADO), in

order to declare the respective register content as
invalid.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 11,
characterized in that the circuit devices are provided in

such a way that, in the event of a most significant
address bit (AADO) of an absolute page address (APAD)

that is to be provided for the memory access being set to
logic "1", the said devices modify the respective memory

command (read, write) into an NOOP command and hence
prevent the memory access.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 10
to 12, characterized in that a further select switch

(MUX3) is connected upstream of the registers (AR-Px1)
for the temporary storage of the absolute page addresses

(APAD) for the first operand and is connected by one of
