<ABSTRACT>
An automated financial system (6) includes a plurality
of wall-mounted user interface units (10, 12, 14) and a

central module system (8), including a plurality of modules
(40, 42, 46, 48) such as may be employed in a conventional

ATM, located in a safe area remote from the interface units
(10, 12 or 14). A track (20) connects each interface unit

(10, 12 or 14) to the central module system (8). A motor-driven
carriage (24) rides on each track (20) and has a

cassette (26) fixed thereto, which is capable of carrying
currency or other media between the respective interface

unit (10, 12 or 14) and the central module system (8). A
receptacle (18) for holding small amounts of currency is

associated with each interface unit (10, 12 or 14) for
supplying small amounts of currency to a user without the

need for obtaining such currency from the central module
system (8). A central track (32) with a carriage-mounted

cassette (38) thereon is associated with the central module
system (8), this cassette (38) having the capability of

transferring media to, or receiving media from, one of the
other cassettes (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automated financial 
system. Automated teller machines (ATMs) have come into 
increasing use in recent years because of the convenience to 
customers of providing fast efficient service at a large 
number of locations and because of the economic advantage 
which they provide to financial institutions in enabling a 
reduction of staffing requirements. Since automated teller machines are relatively large, 
complex machines, any arrangement which reduces their 
overall purchase and maintenance costs is highly desirable. 
In addition, any arrangement which reduces the vulnerability 
of automated teller machines to criminal activity, such as 
"ram raiding", in which a machine may be rammed by a vehicle 
to obtain access to its currency supply, would be highly 
desirable. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
automated financial system which is of reduced cost. Another object of the invention is to provide an 
automated financial system which provides enhanced security 
against "ram raiding" criminal activity. According to the invention there is provided an 
automated financial system for carrying out financial 
transactions, including a plurality of user interface units 
each including apertures for receiving and dispensing media, 
and entry means for determining the type of transaction to 
be made by a user, characterized by a central module system 
remote from said interface units and including an array of 
modules each arranged to receive or dispense specific media, 
and media transport means for transporting media between 
said central module system and said interface units. One embodiment of the invention will now be described 
by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:-  Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a system 
in accordance with the present invention; Fig. 2 is an elevation view showing three wall-mounted 
user interface units; and Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing the interconnections 
for control purposes of the various elements of the system. As shown in Fig. 1, an automated financial system 6 
includes a central module system 8 and a plurality (three, 
in the illustrated embodiment) of ATM fascias, or user 
interface units, 10, 12 and 14, which are mounted in an 
exterior wall 16 (Fig. 2) of the financial institution in 
which the system 6 is installed. Associated with each 
customer interface unit 10, 12 or 14 is a security 
receptacle 18, in which a relatively small quantity of pre-counted 
bundles

<CLAIMS>
An automated financial system (6) for carrying out financial 
transactions, including a plurality of user interface units (10,12,14) each 

including apertures (62,63,64,65) for receiving and dispensing media, 
and entry means (56) for determining the type of transaction to be made 

by a user, characterized by a central module system (8,32,34) remote 
from said interface units (10,12,14) and including a plurality of modules 

(40,42,46,48) each arranged to receive or dispense specific media, and 
media transport means (22) for transporting media between said central 

module system (8,32,34) and said interface units (10,12,14). 
A system according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
media transport means includes a plurality of media transport devices 

(22) respectively associated with said interface units, each transport 
device (22) being arranged to move back and forth along a 

predetermined path between the respective interface unit (10,12 or 14) 
and said central module system (8,32,34) for carrying media from said 

central module system to the respective interface unit and vice versa. 
A system according to claim 2, characterized in that said 
media transport devices (22) are respectively mounted on a plurality of 

tracks (20) for movement therealong, each track (20) extending between 
said central module system (8,32,34) and a respective one of said 

interface units (10,12,14). 
A system according to claim 3, characterized in that said 
central module system (8,32,34) includes a central track (32) associated
