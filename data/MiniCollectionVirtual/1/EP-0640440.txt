<ABSTRACT>
A surface treatment of free-standing and essentially vertical walls is carried out with the aid of a cabin (5) movable relative to the ship wall (2). At least one means for the surface treatment is arranged in the cabin (5). The particles flying around freely during the surface treatment can be taken up and carried away by the cabin. Its side facing the ship (1) is provided with sealing elements running all the way round. To be able to carry out the surface treatment with the aid of the cabin simply and safely and with high stability, two mast elements (8.1, ... 8.n, 9.1, ... 9.n) are arranged on an undercarriage (10). The mast elements (8.1, ... 8.n, 9.1, ... 9.n) are substantially of the same construction and are extended upwards in that they can be joined one above the other on the undercarriage (10) successively from the first to the last mast element (8.1, ... 8.n, 9.1, ... 9.n) according to the desired height. A stabilizing device is arranged on at least one of the mast elements so as to be directed towards the ship wall (2). The cabin (5) has at its opposite ends mast drives (16, 17) connected to the masts (8, 9). Arranged between the open front side of the cabin (5) and the sealing elements running all the way round is a bellows device. The bellows device consists of bellows elements formed from concertina-like folds with an inner wall-bellows covering element located thereabove. If the means for the surface treatment in the cabin (5) is an abrasive blasting nozzle, the cabin (5) is connected to a plant for the preparation of abrasive blasting material.
