<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal
printing of colored images which uses a carrier having
a repeating series of spaced dye frames of different
colored dyes.In one type of thermal printing which prints
colored images, a carrier contains a repeating series
of spaced frames of different colored heat transferable
dyes. Such frames are often yellow, magenta, and cyan
(YMC), or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYB) dye
frames. In such thermal printing apparatus, the
carrier is disposed between a receiver and a print head
formed of, for example, a plurality of individual
heating elements. When a particular heating element is
actuated, it produces heat and causes dye from the
carrier to transfer to the receiver. The density or
darkness of printed colored dye is a function of the
energy delivered from the heating element to the
carrier.Thermal dye transfer printers offer the
advantage of true "continuous tone" dye density
transfer. This result is obtained by varying the
energy applied from each heating element, yielding a
variable dye density image pixel in the receiver.The carrier is sometimes mounted in a
cartridge which includes take-up and supply spools.
While some thermal printers are configured to receive
carrier contained in a cartridge, not all thermal
printers are so configured.A problem is that sometimes there are
defective dye frames. If a single dye frame in a
series is defective, then an unsatisfactory print will 
be produced by the thermal printer. In addition, the
color dye densities in the dye frames may vary from
cartridge to cartridge. If the print head is set up
for a standard series of dye frames, this also can
cause less than satisfactory prints to be produced.The European Patent Application 0 562 979 A2
discloses a thermal printer
(see preable of claim 1)
which uses a cartridge for
mounting a carrier, such carrier having repeating
series of dye frames of different colors and a receiver
which receives dye from a series of spaced dye frames
to form a colored image, such printer including a print
head having one or more selectively actuable elements,
means for moving the carrier and the receiver along
respective paths so as to sequentially move each dye
frame of a series and the receiver relative to the
print head so that as the elements are actuated, dye
from each dye frame of a series is transferred to the
receiver and forms a colored image in the receiver, this
document also discloses:
(a) means for identifying each particular dye
frame series in the carrier and producing a
signal;(b
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A supply for a thermal printer
having a cylindrical spool (20, 70)

and a carrier (14) having a
repeating series of dye frames of different dye colors,

said carrier being spirally wound on said spool such
that the carrier can be unwound from the spool;

electronically-operable memory means
(60) for

storing data corresponding to designated dye frames of
the carrier, whereby upon connection of the supply

to the thermal printer, the printer reads the data;
characterized in that the spool includes a hollow end in which

the memory means is mounted.
Apparatus as set forth in Claim 1,
further characterized by the memory means being adapted

to store data indicative of corrective action to be
taken by a thermal printer to correct the color of a

printed image.
Apparatus as set forth in Claim 2,
further characterized by the memory means being adapted

to store color density correcting data.
Apparatus as set forth in Claim 1,
further characterized by the memory means being adapted

to store data representing a location of a defective
dye frame of the carrier.
Apparatus as set forth in Claim 1,
further characterized by the memory means being non-volatile

memory.
