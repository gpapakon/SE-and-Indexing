<ABSTRACT>
A displacement converter in which a pressure difference is 
determined by detecting capacitances C1 and C2 between fixed 

electrodes (3, 4) and a diaphragm (1), which receives pressure 
differences on both of its sides and can be displaced. The pressure 

difference is output as a process-unified signal via a V/I converter 
(209). This eliminates the need for tedious adjustments involving 

hardware such as a compensation capacitor in order to compensate the 
floating capacitance in capacitances (C1, C2), which is unrelated to 

diaphragm displacement. Instead, adjustment (calibration) is 
simplified without decreasing measurement precision, in that a 

microprocessor (205), in an initial calibration mode, takes a 
plurality of known pressure differences and measures capacitances 

(C1, C2) using time constant measuring unit (202), A/D converter 
(203) and timer counter (206). This data, which is needed to 

determine the constants needed to perform correction on floating 
capacitance and detection of pressure, is stored in memory (204). In 

measurement mode, pressure difference is calculated by using the 
measured capacitances (C1, C2) and the constants stored in memory 

(204). The results are output by the converter via D/A converter 
(207) and V/I converter (209).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for detecting
pressure differences and a device for converting displacements which
detects very small displacements in a diaphragm caused by pressure
differences as differential changes in capacitance, and converts
these changes into a unified signal in order to perform process
control.In the drawings referred to below, like numbers designate
like or corresponding parts.Figure 1 is a drawing for the purpose of describing a
so-called parallel flat plate type of sensor comprising the
following: a movable electrode comprising a planar circular diaphragm
that is displaced in a direction perpendicular to its plane by a
distance of Δd, which is proportional to a pressure difference p
(=PH-PL) between the two surfaces; and two fixed electrodes arranged
on either side of the diaphragm so that they are parallel to and face
the diaphragm. The two fixed electrodes and the movable electrode
(i.e. the diaphragm) form a pair of capacitors. Figure 1(A) shows
the arrangement of the electrodes and Figure 1(B) shows the
electrical circuit.In Figure 1, diaphragm 1 (1A, 1B) indicates a diaphragm
(movable electrode) at different displacement positions. Fixed
electrodes 3, 4 are arranged on either side of diaphragm 1 so that
they are parallel to the surface of diaphragm 1. PL and PH indicate
the low (negative) and high (positive) pressure applied to the left
and right surfaces of diaphragm 1 via small holes 3a and 4a arranged
on fixed electrodes 3, 4. Distance 2d indicates the distance between
the fixed electrodes 3, 4. The areas of electrodes 1, 3 and 4 are
all substantially equal.Position 1A indicates the position of diaphragm 1 when the
pressures applied to diaphragm 1 are PH=PL (i.e. when pressure
difference P=0). Distances d1 and d2 indicate the gaps between 
diaphragm 1 and respective fixed electrodes 3 and 4 when PH=PL.
Similarly, δ indicates a displacement of diaphragm 1 from the centre
point between fixed electrodes 3 and 4.Position 1B indicates a position of diaphragm 1 when the
applied pressure difference between the diaphragm surfaces is
P=PH-PL>O. Δd is the displacement of diaphragm 1.Referring to Figure 1(B), capacitance CA is the part of
total capacitance C1 between diaphragm 1 and fixed electrode 3 that
changes according to the displacement of diaphragm 1. Similarly,
floating capacitance CS1 is the part of capacitance C1 that does not
change according to the displacement of diaphragm 1. Capacitance CB
is the part of total capacitance C2 between diaphragm 1 and fixed
el
