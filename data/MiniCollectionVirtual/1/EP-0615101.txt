<ABSTRACT>
Cooling tower consisting of a casing (1) with a sealed bottom and a 
heat exchange area (2) through which water circulates in the downward 

direction and air in the upward direction. The water collected at the 
lower part (4) of the cooling tower is transported with a pump to heat 

sources, from which the heated water is passed through a water-air heat 
exchanger (7) located at the air inlet of the cooling tower before it is 

returned to the cooling tower at the upper part of its heat exchange 
area (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of this invention is a new cooling tower, 
of the type of tower constructed from a casing or housing 
sealed at least at one of its ends and whose interior is 
provded with certain cooling elements past which falls 
water driven by an external pump. The main problems presented by cooling towers of the 
type stated above lie in the consumption of water and in 
low efficiency, due to the humidity difference existing in 
the air in the different places. The first of the problems has already been considered 
by Spanish patent NÂº 9001466. With the aim of remedying the 
problem and avoiding the provision of the auxiliary water 
device that these cooling towers require, that patent 
proposes that a circuit be provided in which the water 
accumulated at the bottom of the tower is driven by a pump 
towards the elements to be cooled. The hot water is then 
made to pass to a radiator provided in the upper part of 
the tower and which is cooled by the same fan that cools 
the water during its descent which takes place when the 
outlet from the radiator is connected to a sprinkler 
element, the water falling to the bottom via at least one 
perforated tray. The objective of the invention is to achieve the dual 
aim of, on the one hand, reducing water consumption as far 
as possible and, on the other, increasing the efficiency of 
the cooling tower. The invention achieves its objectives by 
means of the prior drying of the air that is made to 
circulate inside the tower, which leads to a greater heat 
exchange capacity between the two fluids.  Drying of the air introduced into the cooling tower is 
achieved by providing the air intake in the tower, 
preferably outside the tower, with a heating element 
through which the air is made to circulate so that it can 
dry, the air then being introduced into the tower for 
circulating in countercurrent with the water to be cooled. Clearly, the heating element can be of any kind, for 
example it could be a heat pump, a dryer, one or several 
resistances, etc. Nevertheless, with the aim of ensuring 
that the provision of this heating element does not imply 
additional energy consumption, it can consist of one or 
more radiators fed by the hot return water coming from the 
cooling apparatus fed by the cooling tower. In this way, drying of the air is achieved at the same 
time as reducing the temperature of the water returning to 
the cooling tower. The heating element mentioned above can have a fan 
associated with it in order to drive the air to be dried, 
which then

<CLAIMS>
Cooling tower of the type consisting of a casing 
(1) with a sealed bottom, inside which is a heat exchange 

area (2) through which circulates water in the downward 
direction and air in the upward direction, the lower part 

(4) being connected through a pump to the elements to be 
cooled, from which the hot water returns to the upper part 

of the tower for cooling, characterized by the fact that 
provided in the air intake to the tower is a heating 

element (7) responsible for drying the air before it is 
introduced into the tower for circulation in countercurrent 

with the water to be cooled. 
Cooling tower according to patent claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that the heating element (7) 

preferably consists of a radiator, around which the hot 
return water from the cooling apparatus can be made to 

circulate. 
Cooling tower according to patent claim 2, 
characterized by the fact that the radiator (7) is 

associated with a fan (8) for driving the air to be dried.
