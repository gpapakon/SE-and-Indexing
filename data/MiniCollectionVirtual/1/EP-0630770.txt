<ABSTRACT>
The McPherson-type rear suspension for front-wheel 
drive motor vehicles comprises a wheel hub 

(10), a spring - shock absorber assembly (2), 
articulated to the body and to the wheel hub (10), 

a cross member (16) which is fixed to the body and 
articulated by means of two symmetrical arms (12, 

14) to the wheel hub (10), and a third arm (20) 
for articulation between the end (18) of the 

spring - shock absorber assembly (2) and the cross 
member (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the rear 
suspensions of motor vehicles, in particular those 
of the McPherson type, mounted on front-wheel 
drive vehicles. Rear suspension systems of the 
type specified above are known in which the spring 
- shock absorber unit is articulated, at one of 
its ends, to the vehicle body and, at its other 
end, to the wheel-bearing hub of the vehicle 
itself. The wheel-bearing hub is articulated by means 
of two arms to a rear cross member which is fixed 
to the vehicle body. Although they are satisfactory from the point 
of view of behaviour, suspensions of the type 
described above do not enable the camber angle to 
be controlled in optimum fashion and, in 
particular, they do not enable the camber angle to 
be controlled for the entire travel of the wheel, 
such that it tends to open out progressively 
downwardly as it rises towards the vehicle 
body. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a McPherson-type rear suspension for 
front-wheel drive vehicles which overcomes the  
 
above disadvantage, is of simple construction and 
of low cost. A further object of the present invention is 
to produce a suspension in accordance with the 
above which is completely interchangeable with a 
conventional suspension without alteration of 
the body. These objects are achieved by means of a 
McPherson suspension having the characteristics 
specified in the following claim. The invention will now be described with 
reference to the appended drawings provided solely 
by way of non-limiting example and in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the 
suspension to which the invention relates; and Figure 2 shows a partial plan view of the 
suspension to which the invention relates. With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in which 
the common parts are indicated by the same 
reference numerals, the spring - shock absorber 
assembly articulated at its end 4 to the vehicle 
body (not shown) is indicated 2; its end portion 6  
 
is fixed to a bracket 8 articulated to the 
wheel hub 10 by the articulation 9. The wheel hub is articulated by two arms 12 
and 14 to a cross member 16 which is fixed to the 
vehicle body. The articulations of the arms 12 and 
14 to the body and to the wheel hub 10 are 
preferably produced by means of rotational 
couplings, for example, by means of cylindrical 
bushes, or by couplings by means of rubber bushes 
(silent blocks). The lower end 18 of the spring - shock 
absorber assembly 2 is connected in an articulated 
manner to the cross member 16 by means
