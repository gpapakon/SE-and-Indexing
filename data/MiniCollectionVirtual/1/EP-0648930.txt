<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling and/or monitoring the knocking of an internal combustion engine with a plurality of cylinders and such an internal combustion engine are proposed, in which the combustion conditions in one cylinder are purposely varied in advance so that this cylinder begins to knock first and it is only necessary to monitor this cylinder for knocking, and so that by purposely varying parameters the internal combustion engine can still be reliably operated even when knocking combustion starts to occur due to changes in the fuel quality or other operating parameters.
