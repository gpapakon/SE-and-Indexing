<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
displaying an image of a wide field angle, and
particularly to an image display apparatus adapted to
be mounted on the head portion or face of a person who
observes an image and enable the person to observe the
image information of a small display element such as a
liquid crystal display element or a CRT therethrough
while enlarging the image information as a virtual
image.A display apparatus using a multilayer film
reflecting surface or an optically transparent beam
coupling element such as a hologram optical element to
enable display information (image information) from a
display element and image information such as a scene
in the external world to be spatially superposed one
upon the other in the same field of view and observed
is generally called a head up display apparatus and is
utilized in various fields. Also, a display apparatus
in which the beam combiner is provided at a location
relatively near to an observer's eyes in order to make
the parts of the optical device of the head up display 
apparatus small and the optical device is mounted on a
helmet is called a helmet mounted display apparatus
(HMD apparatus), and its various applications to a
display apparatus for the operation of an aircraft, a
display apparatus for amusements such as games or for
virtual reality, etc. have been proposed. Prior art document GB-A 2,259,213 discloses a variable
resolution view-tracking panoramic display, wherein the
panoramic display apparatus is mounted on the helmet to be
worn by an operator. A specific head position tracking
device and an eye position tracking device are operated in
combination and enable an operator to watch specifically
displayed images and in particular a high resolution stereo
display within a small first field of view containing the
foveal line of sight of an operator's eyes and a low
resolution display outside the first field of view. Control
of the panoramic display apparatus is performed on an
output information according to the detected line of sight
and the operator's detected head position. Both displays of
different resolution are displayed by means of a liquid
crystal display means which is mounted on or form part of
an eye shield of the helmet. The combined image can
simultaneously be watched and specifically the content of
the high-resolution image being smaller than the panoramic
(low-resolution) image is controlled by considering the
operator's line of sight.Furthermore, document US 4,479,784 discloses an eye line-of-sight
