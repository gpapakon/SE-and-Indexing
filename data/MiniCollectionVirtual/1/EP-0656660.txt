<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to semiconductor processing and more
specifically to BiCMOS processes.The integration of MOSFET structures and bipolar transistors on a single
substrate has become very desirable. As is well known in the art, digital and
linear functions are often performed by integrated circuits using either bipolar or
metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology. Bipolar integrated circuits, of
course provide higher speed operation and greater drive currents than the MOS
circuits, at the cost of higher power dissipation, especially when compared
against complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits. Advances in manufacturing
technology have allowed the use of both bipolar and CMOS transistors in the
same integrated circuit (commonly referred to as BiCMOS devices). Bipolar
transistors are typically formed by using a moat region for the base of the bipolar
transistor, doped polysilicon for the emitter, and a well region for the collector.
Additional moat regions are then used to form any source/drain regions of PMOS
transistors. Further exploitation of the high current driving capabilities of the
bipolar transistor is important to obtaining even higher levels of bipolar or
merged bipolar CMOS integration.A BiCMOS device as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim 13 is known
from US-A-4,868,135. That document further discloses a method for fabricating a
BiCMOS device. The process steps include forming the reach-through N+
subcollector to the bipolar device without extra processing steps; combining into
one mask the threshold adjust/well implants with self-aligned isolation leakage
protection implants by using a self-aligned, removable oxide mask prior to field
isolation; using a resist etch-back scheme to protect against emitter-to-base punch-through
via self-aligning the pedestal and base; and also providing for the removal
of the gate oxide at the emitter while maintaining it at the FET, without extra
masks. To achieve a low resistivity, a silicide is formed on the polysilicon for the
gates and emitters and a CVD oxide or intrinsic polysilicon is used to cap the
silicide. The gate/emitter stacks are then patterned by directional etching.Reference is further made to US-A-5,031,020, which discloses a semiconductor
device comprising a P channel MOSFET having a gate, a source, and a drain, and
a bipolar transistor having a collector, a base, and an emitter. The semiconductor
device also includes an N- collector diffusion layer formed in an epitaxial layer on
a P-type semiconductor substrate and
