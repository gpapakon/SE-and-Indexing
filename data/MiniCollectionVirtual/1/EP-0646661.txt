<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an improved method 
for removing soldering flux using aqueous cleaning 

compositions, in particular for removing rosin soldering 
flux or other residues from electronic circuit assemblies 

such as printed circuit boards or printed wiring boards, 
comprising (a) contacting the board with an aqueous flux 

removing solution comprising from about 0.1 to 15 percent by 
weight of a flux removing composition comprising alkaline 

salts, said solution having a pH of from about 10 to 13; 
(b) allowing the contact to continue for sufficient time to 

emulsify and remove soldering flux or residues; and 
(c) removing the combined composition and soldering flux or 

other residues from the board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to improvements in 
methods for removing soldering flux. In particular, the 
invention is concerned with improvements in a method for 
using aqueous cleaning compositions to remove rosin 
soldering flux or other residues from electronic circuit 
assemblies such as printed circuit boards or printed wiring 
boards.
 
As described in commonly-assigned co-pending European 
application 93908434.9, it has been found that solder fluxes 
contained on electronic circuit assemblies, such as printed 
circuit boards and printed wiring boards, can be effectively 
removed by contact with aqueous solutions of alkaline salts 
such as alkali metal carbonates and mixtures of alkali metal 
carbonates and bicarbonates. It has further been found that 
the addition of alkali metal silicates to such formulations 
greatly improves the corrosion protection of ceramic and 
metal components on such electronic assemblies. The improved aqueous cleaning methods of this invention 
are useful in many and varied types of cleaning 
compositions, such as dishwashing detergents, laundry 
detergents and the like, the compositions of this invention 
and are particularly useful in removing solder flux and 
other residues from electronic circuit assemblies such as 
disclosed in the above-mentioned commonly assigned 
application. The cleanliness of electronic circuit assemblies (ECA), 
such as printed circuit boards (PCB) or printed wiring 
boards (PWB), is generally regarded as being critical to 
their functional reliability. Ionic and non-ionic 
contamination on circuit assemblies is believed to 
contribute to premature failures of the circuit assemblies 
by allowing short circuits to develop.  In the manufacture of electronic circuit assemblies, 
ionic and non-ionic contamination can accumulate after one 
or more steps of the process. Circuit assembly materials 
are plated, etched, handled by operators in assembly, coated 
with corrosive or potentially corrosive fluxes and finally 
soldered. In the fabrication of electronic circuit assemblies, 
e.g., printed circuit boards, soldering fluxes are first 
applied to the substrate board material to ensure firm, 
uniform bonding of the solder. These soldering fluxes fall 
into two broad categories: rosin and non-rosin, or water 
soluble, fluxes. The rosin fluxes, which are generally only 
moderately corrosive and have a much longer history of use, 
are still widely used throughout the electronics industry. 
The water soluble fluxes, which are a more recent

A method for removing rosin soldering flux alone 
or with other residues from a printed wiring board, 

comprising 

(a) contacting the board with an aqueous flux removing 
solution comprising from about 0.1 to 15 percent by weight 

of a flux removing composition comprising alkaline salts, 
said solution having a pH of from about 10 to 13; 
(b) allowing the contact to continue for sufficient time to 
emulsify and remove soldering flux or residues; and 
(c) removing the combined composition and soldering flux or 
other residues from the board.

adequate reserve of titratable alkalinity, at least 

equivalent to from about 0.2 to 4.5 percent caustic potash 
when titrated to the colorless phenolphthalein end point.
