<ABSTRACT>
A number of tables based on condition series, such as 
"0 run, value" or "size", are formed by repeatedly executing 

operation in which quantization coarseness of a quantizer is 
controlled by supplying total code length data obtained in 

Huffman code processing to the quantizer. When coefficient data 
is coded by using these tables, a table corresponding to a size 

of coefficient data provided before that coefficient data is 
selected and the coefficient data is coded on the basis of the 

selected table, thereby making it possible to suppress the total 
code length to be short. The coding apparatus includes a 

Huffman table generating apparatus, a transform circuit (2), a 
quantizer (3), and a variable length coder (4) having a memory 

(4a) which stores therein tables provided for every condition 
series.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to coding of
digital signals and provides coding apparatus for use for
example with apparatus for transmitting or recording and
reproducing a variety of information, such as video and
audio signals or the like.A variety of video signal coding apparatus have
hitherto been proposed to transmit or record an image at a bit
rate as low as possible with a sufficiently high picture
quality.As one of such coding apparatus, there has been proposed
a high-efficiency coding apparatus using a DCT (discrete cosine
transform) and a Huffman coding.In this coding apparatus, data such as
video and audio data to be coded is converted into coefficient
data by a discrete cosine transform (DCT) circuit, for example,
at every block from a DC component to a high-order AC component.
The coefficient data is then quantized and the coefficient data
thus quantized is coded by a variable length coder.The DCT circuit converts a DC component to a high-order
AC component of the blocked data into two-dimensional
coefficient data. Converted coefficient data is scanned (in a
so-called zigzag scan fashion) and then coded, as shown in FIG.
1. Coding is carried out in accordance with the scanning order, 
and coefficient data of the last coefficient which becomes non-zero
after quantization lies in a coding range.Coefficient data obtained within the coding range by
the zigzag scanning are arrayed in a line as shown in FIG. 2,
for example. The coefficient data thus arrayed are coded by the
variable length coder according to some suitable methods, such
as the Huffman coding method or the like. U.S. patent No.
4,901,075 describes the Huffman coding technique.In FIG. 2, DC represents DC component coefficient data
("168" in this example shown in FIG. 2), and AC01 through AC33
represent AC component coefficient data. The AC component
coefficient data becomes high-order as their numerals become
large. As shown in FIG. 2, the DC component coefficient data DC
to the high-order AC component coefficient data AC33 are coded
as codes C1 to Cn, in that order. Also, as shown in FIG. 2,
when coefficient data are coded, they are coded at the unit of
consecutive "0"s and the succeeding value. In the following
description, "0 run" means the number of consecutive "0"s.
Expression of "0 run 0" shows that the number of "0 run" is "0",
i.e., there exists no "0".In FIG. 2, AC component coefficient data AC20 is "0",
the next AC component coefficient data AC11 is "0", the next AC
component coefficient data AC02 is "0" and the next AC
