<ABSTRACT>
A prefabricated structural wall unit for houses, comprising a load-carrying reinforced concrete panel (2) and a rigid insulating material (4) in abutment against the broad face (3) and secured to said broad face (3) by means of thin bars (11) of thin galvanized sheet metal, said bars having flanges (14) in abutment against the face (13) of the insulating material (4) that is turned away from said broad face (3), and also anchoring members (15) which are embedded into the concrete of the panel (2) and extend transversely to and through the insulating material (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PREFABRICATED STRUCTURAL UNITThe subject invention concerns a prefabricated structural unit for use in the construction of buildings, such as houses or similar structures, said structural unit having an essentially rectangular configuration and comprising a load-bearing panel of preferably reinforced concrete and a preferably rigid insulating material in abutting relationship with at least one of the broad faces of the panel and essentially covering said panel face.Structural units of this kind are used above all as load-bearing wall units for exterior walls or partition walls and/or as load-bearing units or as floor panels, the concrete of the panel or board being either conventional concrete or light weight concrete, depending on the intended application.In one prior-art structural unit of the kind defined above, the insulating material is attached to the broad face of the concrete panel during the manufacturing process proper by means of such methods as pounter- casting, glueing or the like.In many cases, these attachment measures are insufficient, for instance because in course of time the insulating material tends to separate from the concrete panel, and for this reason supplementary securing means are often used, such as wooden nailing battens which are applied to the insulating material face that is turned away from the broad face of the panel. These wooden battens are usually nailed through the insulating material and into the concrete panel by means of concrete nails or similar fasteners, which are applied manually or by gun.In order to be able to penetrate through the insulating material and a sufficient distance into the concrete panel to ensure safe anchoring of the wooden nailing battens -.he nails or fasteners must be compara¬ tively long and it is important that they are directed at right angles to the concrete panel when nailed into the 

latter. If directed obliquely, the nail will often fail to penetrate sufficiently far into the concrete panel, resulting in deficient anchoring of the wooden battens and/or the nail heads splitting the wooden battens which thus need to be replaced.In addition, the wooden nailing battens have a con¬ siderable thickness in themselves, usually about 20-40 mm. , which means that they project by the corresponding length outwards from the face of the insulating material that is turned away from the concrete panel broad side. One disadvantage of this arrangement is the detraction from the aesthetic appearance of the structural unit which therefore cannot be

CLAIMS
1. A prefabricated structural wall unit (1) for use in the construction of buildings, such as houses or similar structures, said structural unit (1) having an essentially rectangular configuration and comprising a load-carrying panel (2) of preferably reinforced concrete and a preferably rigid insulating material (4) in abutting relationship with at least one (3) of the broad faces of the concrete panel (2) and essentially covering said broad face (3) of the panel, said insulating material (4) being securely anchored to said broad face (3) of the concrete panel (2) by means of bars (11) of thin, preferably galvanized sheet metal, said bars (11) formed with flanges (14) in abutting relationship with the face (13) of the insulating material (4) that is turned away from said broad face (3), and also with anchoring members (15) extending transversely through the insulating material (4) and into the concrete panel (2) in which they are embedded, said concrete slab (2) having flanges (7, 8) which are cast integrally with said panel and which extend along the two oppositely positioned lengthwise panel edges (5, 6) so as to at least partly cover the edge faces (9) of the insulating material (4) that are turned towards said panel edges, the sheet metal bars (11) being positioned alongside the lengthwise and transverse edges (5, 6, 12) of the concrete panel (2) and also intermediate the oppositely positioned longitudinal or transverse bars ( 11 ) , c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that alongside the lengthwise and transverse edges (5, 6, 12) of the concrete panel (2) said sheet metal bars (11) form the head and bottom battens and end uprights, respectively, of the structural unit (1) and are configured essentially as L- section members one flange (14) of which is in planar position of abutment against and flush with the face (13) of the insulating material (4) that is turned away from 


the broad face (3) of the concrete slab (2) and the second flange (16) of which is flush with the lengthwise and transverse edges (5, 6, 12) of the concrete panel (2), in that intermediate said oppositely positioned lengthwise and transverse sheet metal bars (11) said bars (11) form intermediate uprights configured essentially as T-section members the crossbar (14) of which is in planar position of abutment against and flush with the face (13) of the insulating material (4) that is turned away from the broad face (3) of the concrete slab (2) and the shank (17) of which is doubled and extend into the joint (18) between neighbouring sheets (10), positioned edge to edge, of the insulating material (4), and in that the anchoring members (15) are formed by sheet metal strips (19) which are attached, preferably by welding, to the sheet metal bars (11) in spaced apart positions, said strips having end portions (20) extending at an angle to the strips and being embedded into the concrete of said panel (2).
2. A structural wall unit as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that along the lengthwise edges (22) of the flanges (14, 16) on the bars (11) the latter are somewhat bent in the direction towards the face (13) of the insulating material (4) that is turned away from the broad side (3) of the concrete panel (2) so as to engage said face (13), as well as toward *-*.s the lengthwise flanges (7, 8) of the concrete panel (2) for stabilizing and edge-lining purposes.
3. A structural wall unit as claimed in claims 1 and 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that at least some of the sheet metal bars (11) have tongues (21) which are punched from the bar material and which are bent in over or into the insulating material (4) to be secured relatively thereto.
4. A structural wall unit as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that in a manner known per se the insulating material (4) is formed by sheets (10) of cellular plastics and/or mineral 


wool.
5. A structural wall unit as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the sheet metal bars (11) forming the end and intermediate uprights are provided with apertures for passage-through of electrical tubes or the like and forming attachments for electrical boxes and the like.
6. A structural wall unit as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that wall covering, preferably in the shape of building panels or gypsum boards, is mounted on the sheet metal bars (11), preferably by means of screws and/or glue, and in that the centre distance between the sheet metal bars (11) forming the end and intermediate uprights, is flexible and amounts to 900 mm. when gypsum bords and cellular plastics insula¬ tion is used.
