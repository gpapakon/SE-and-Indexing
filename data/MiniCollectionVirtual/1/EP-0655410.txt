<ABSTRACT>
The test assembly acts on a slack rope device 
(4,5,6) for activating a safety system (8) of the 

elevator. The test assembly includes an attachment 
strap (2, 15) of a rope (1) slideably engaged with a 

fastening device (1), a flange (14) carried on said 
attachment strap (2,15), above said fastening device 

(1), a system of levers (9,10, 12) engaged with said 
flange (14) to prevent movement of the attachment strap 

(2, 15) and means (16) for remote activation of the 
lever system (9, 10, 12). Activation of the system of 

levers (9,10,12) permits movement of the rope (3) 
sufficient to activate the slack rope device (4,5,6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an assembly to
facilitate testing of safety mechanisms in hydraulic
elevators.As is well known, hydraulic elevators can be
actuated directly or indirectly. In the latter type of
elevators, a piston or.pistons are connected to the
framework of the car by means of a series of ropes,
which are, in turn, sent back over pulleys. As is
obvious, in this type of elevator it is also necessary
to provide safety mechanisms that intervene in case a
rope slackens, i.e., loses tension, or breaks.
Generally, a speed governor is used to prevent the rate
of descent from exceeding a predetermined value.In some configurations a slack rope system is
provided instead of a governor. Such a mechanism, used
along with a rupture valve over the piston, substitutes
for the governor. In case a rope breaks or loses
tension, small wheels provided along the running guides
of the elevator car are automatically pressed against
the running guides, thus stopping the travel of the
elevator car.When a new elevator is installed, a building
inspector is expected to test the efficacy of the safety
mechanisms, such as the slack rope system. According to
the standard procedures, such a test must typically be
effected outside of the hoistway. Therefore, a device
that allows a slack rope condition to be simulated must
be provided to be able to conduct such a test before the
system is approved.Currently the cars of hydraulic elevators are
mounted on a framework consisting of two uprights and a
base. On each upright are the slide runners or rollers
of the elevator car and a safety plate. The safety 
plate includes a roller that moves vertically and which,
if activated, presses against the guide, stopping the
elevator car. Each of the rollers is engaged by a
torsion bar that actuates the rollers.If a slack rope device is installed on the
elevator, the building operators may adopt several
solutions to allow the test to be conducted by the
inspectors. One solution includes the steps of directly
connecting a rope to the torsion bar and pulling it from
the pit to engage the rollers with the guide and thereby
block the full path of travel of the elevator car. As
can be understood, this system is not particularly
efficacious in that it does not actually de-tension the
rope.In other devices, straps are mounted onto the
guides and directly onto the framework of the elevator
car. The straps on the car are used to keep the torsion
bar of the safety system in the rest position by means
of the pressure of the springs of the hoist

<CLAIMS>
A test assembly for facilitating safety tests in an
elevator having a slack rope device, the test assembly

including:

a fastening device (1) for a rope (3);
means (2,15) for attaching a rope to said fastening
device (1);
abutment means (14) carried on the attachment means
(2,15);
means (10) for engaging the abutment means (14) to
prevent relative movement between the abutment means

(14) and the fastening device (1); and
means (16) for remotely disengaging the engagement
means (10) from the abutment means (14), wherein such

disengagement permits movement of the attachment means
(2) relative to the fastening device (1) sufficient to

activate the slack rope device;

characterised in that the means to engage the
abutment includes a support (9) on which a first (10)

and a second (12) lever are hinged, and wherein in the
deactivated position of the device, one end of the first

lever (10) is engaged with the abutment means (14) and
its opposite end is positioned above one end of the

second lever (12), the means of remote disengagement
(16) being connected to the opposite end of the second

lever (12), the two levers (10,12) being positioned with
respect to each other in such a way that, when the means

to remotely disengage is acted upon, the second lever
(12) rotates, releasing the end of the first lever (10)

with which it is engaged, allowing the first lever (10)
to rotate and thereby release the abutment means (14).
The test assembly according to claim 1, further
including means (19) to prevent activation of the test

assembly. 
The test assembly according to claim 2, wherein the
means to prevent activation of the test assembly

includes a safety pin (19) engaged with the engagement
means (10).
The test assembly of any of the preceding claims
wherein said abutment means comprises a flange (14).
The test assembly of any of the preceding claims
wherein said abutment means (14) is arranged above said

fastening device (1).
The test assembly of any of the preceding claims
wherein said attachment means comprises a strap
 (2).
The test assembly according to any of the preceding
claims, further including a return spring (17) disposed

between the fastening device and the end of the
attachment means.
The test assembly according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein the means to remotely disengage includes

a cord (16) connected to the means (10) to engage the
abutment means (14).
