<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a
solventless method for making polycarbonates by a
transesterification reaction between diaryl carbonate
and aromatic bis hydroxy compound. More particularly,
the present invention relates to the employment of a
guanidine catalyst to facilitate the melt condensation
between diphenyl carbonate and bisphenol A.Methods for making polycarbonate by a
solventless melt condensation reaction between
diphenyl carbonate and bisphenol A are shown by
Sakashita et al, U.S. Patent 5,026,817 and EP-A-535261. In one
procedure, Sakashita et al uses reactants having a
particular range of hydrolyzable chlorine. In another
method, a mixed catalyst is used, such as a nitrogen
containing basic compound and an aromatic hydroxy salt
of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. Some of
the preferred basic compounds are tetraalkylammonium
hydroxides, such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide. It
has been found, however, that during the
polymerization reaction, the tetramethylammonium
hydroxide decomposes to produce a variety of products
which can contaminate the final polymer. A second
catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide is often employed
as a finishing catalyst.EP-A-0535261 discloses a process for melt-producing
polycarbonates by polycondensing at least one dihydric
phenol and biphenyl carbonate in the presence of a
catalyst which is a combination of an electron donating
amine compound and an alkali metal or alkaline earth
metal compound.  A further method for making polycarbonates
by melt transesterification of diphenyl carbonate with
2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane is shown by Yangsoo
Kim et al, Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research,
1992, 31, 2118-2127. Kim et al employ a lithium
hydroxide catalyst. The effects of reaction
temperature and catalyst concentration and conversion
of oligomer are analyzed.Although alkali metal hydroxides have been
found effective either as a finishing catalyst or as a
condensation catalyst, these materials are carried
into the final resin which can be adversely affected.Basic catalysts which are sufficiently
volatile, such as organic nitrogen compounds, for
example organic amines, also have been evaluated as
condensation catalysts. Although such organic
compounds can be readily removed from the
polycarbonate resin at the termination of the
condensation reaction, color bodies are often
generated. It would be desirable therefore, to
provide organic compounds useful as catalysts for
effecting the condensation between a diaryl carbonate
and an aromatic bis hydroxy
