<ABSTRACT>
A car-cleaning implement (1) comprises a spongy resiliently-flexible liquid-absorbent block (2) having an exposed face (3) for applying soapy water, and its opposite face sheathed with a thin flexible skin (4) which is not water absorbent and is formed with parallel ribs (5) extending between opposite ends of the block. By inverting the block after washing off the soapy water, the ribbed skin can be used to remove water droplets from the painted surface of the car without streaking.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the washing of extended surfaces 
open to atmospheric pollution and grime, and is 
specifically, although not exclusively, concerned with 
hand-cleaning the paint-work of a motor vehicle. The conventional way of cleaning the paint-work of a motor 
vehicle by hand, is to sponge down the paint-work with 
water, apply a cleaning agent such as a detergent or soap to 
the paint-work with a sponge and plenty of water, wash down 
the paint-work after cleaning with plenty of water usually 
supplied by a hose, and finally wiping residual spots of 
water from the paint work with a chamois leather which 
removes any free surface water from the paint-work. 
An implement according to the prior art is disclosed in document 
GB-A-836238. An object of the invention is to provide an improved 
implement for cleaning an extended surface by hand. According to the present invention, there is provided a soft 
implement for cleaning grime and for wiping 
standing liquid from an extended curved surface, comprising 
a resiliently-flexible block of water-absorbent 
spongy material having one face exposed for applying a 
cleaning solution, such as soapy water, to the surface to be 
cleaned, wherein the opposite face is sheathed 
with a resiliently-flexible 
skin of material which is non-absorbent to water 
and which is bonded over substantially its entire area to  
 
said opposite face so as to be effectively integral 
therewith characterised in that, said skin has non-absorbent V-shaped 
ribs formed on the exposed surface of the 
skin, said ribs flexing with the skin 
so as to act with a squegee action for removing a 
standing liquid from a curved surface being cleaned. The implement enables the cleaning solution to be hand-applied 
by way of the exposed face of the spongy block, and, 
after the cleaning solution has been washed off with clean 
water, residual drops of the water are removed by wiping the 
ribbed face of the block across the surface. The ribs on 
the face flex to conform to the contour of the surface 
beneath the block and act with a squeegee action to provide 
dams which remove water droplets from the area of the 
surface over which the ribbed face of the block is passed, 
so that the water droplets are removed and a clean and 
virtually drop-free surface emerges from beneath the block. In the preferred form of the invention the block has a flat 
rectangular face on one side, and its opposite side is of 
generally semi-cylindrical shape and is sheathed with the 
ribbed skin. The ribs of

<CLAIMS>
A soft implement (1) for cleaning 
grime and for wiping standing liquid from an extended curved 

surface, comprising a resiliently-flexible block (2) of 
water-absorbent spongy material having one face 

(3) exposed for applying a cleaning solution, such as soapy 
water, to the surface to be cleaned, wherein 

the opposite face is sheathed with a 
resiliently-flexible skin (4) of material 

which is non-absorbent to water and which is 
bonded over substantially its entire area to said opposite 

face so as to be effectively integral therewith, characterised in that 
said skin has non-absorbent V-shaped ribs (5, 6, 7) 

formed on the exposed surface of the skin, said ribs 
flexing with the skin so as to act with a squeegee action for 

removing a standing liquid from a curved surface being cleaned. 
An implement as claimed in claim 1, in which the ribs 
are spaced and substantially parallel and extended in 

continuous fashion between opposite ends of the block. 
An implement as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which 
the ribs are each formed from spaced rib sections which 

are staggered with respect to the rib sections of the 
neighbouring ribs. 
An implement as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
in which the exposed face of the block is rectangular, and 

said skin provides a semi-cylindrical hand-hold for the 
implement. 
An implement as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
in which the block is made from open cell soft foam and the skin is 

made from a closed cell foam layer integrally formed with the ribs.  
 
An implement as claimed in claim 5, in which the 
material of the block is polyurethane and the material of 

the skin is ethylene vinyl acetate or polyethylene. 
An implement as claimed in claim 6, in which the ribs 
are heat formed onto the skin. 
An implement as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
in which the ribs are in the shape of letters.
