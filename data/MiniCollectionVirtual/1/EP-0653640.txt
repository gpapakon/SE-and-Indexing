<ABSTRACT>
The degree of a structure change of the sugar 
chain of a glycoprotein caused by a disease can be 

measured with high precision rapidly by separating and 
measuring two or more forms of glycoproteins which 

are different in sugar chain structure but have 
substantially the same protein structure, by using a 

combination of a lectin capable of recognizing the 
specific sugar chain structure of at least one of these 

glycoprotein analytes to be measured, and a first 
antibody which has a property of binding to all the 

glycoprotein analytes but is kept from binding to 
glycoprotein analyte(s) having the lectin attached 

thereto; and separating and measuring glycoprotein 
analyte(s) having the first antibody attached thereto 

and glycoprotein analyte(s) having no first antibody 
attached thereto, by utilizing differences in properties 

between the former glycoprotein analyte(s) and the 
latter glycoprotein analyte(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
separating and measuring two or more forms of glycoproteins
which are different in sugar chain structure.In not only human beings but also most
animals, many of proteins contained in body fluids are
glycoproteins having one or more sugar chains. Recently,
because of the diversity of its structure and the
like, the sugar chain moiety is particularly noted as a
substance carrying some information concerning the
interior of a living body and is studied in many
universities and research institutes both inside and
outside Japan.In the course of the study, a change in the
sugar chain structure of a specific glycoprotein caused
by some disease was often observed. For example, in
human α-fetoprotein (AFP), it was confirmed that the
addition of an α-L-fucose residue or an N-acetyl-glucosamine
residue (bisecting N-acetylglucosamine) to
AFP sugar chain is frequently observed with the progress
of hepatic cellular carcinoma. Furthermore, the degree
of such a change of the sugar chain structure is independent
of the AFP concentration in serum and the change
is confirmed even in early hepatic cellular carcinoma.
Therefore, it is considered that the investigation of 
the degree of the change permits diagnosis of cancer.
Thus, the change of the sugar chain structure is noted.The degree of change of the sugar chain
structure of a glycoprotein is measured mainly by an
analytical method using a lectin, such as lectin column
method or lectin electrophoresis method. The reason why
the degree of change of the sugar chain structure is
measured mainly by use of a lectin is, for example, as
follows. Lectins are not expensive. Moreover, since
the immunogenicity of the sugar chain moiety of a
glycoprotein is lower than that of the protein
portion of the glycoprotein, no effective anti-sugar
chain antibody can be obtained except that for a part of
the non-reducing terminal structure, namely, the
preparation of an antibody to the sugar chain of the
glycoprotein is very difficult.However, although lectins have a high
recognizing specificity for the sugar chain structure,
their bonding strength (coupling constant) to the sugar
chain is one over thousands to one over tens of
thousands as high as that of the antibody. Therefore,
it is difficult to form a complex of a lectin and the
sugar chain which is stable like a complex formed by
antigen-antibody reaction. Accordingly, when a lectin
is used in place of an antibody in an analytical method
requiring a washing procedure after the formation of a
co

A process for separating and measuring two or
more forms of glycoproteins as analytes that are

different in sugar chain structure but have substantially
the same protein structure, which comprises reacting

a sample containing two or more forms of glycoproteins
with a lectin capable of recognizing the specific sugar

chain structure of at least one of these glycoproteins
to be measured, and a first antibody which has a

property of binding to all the glycoproteins but is kept
from binding to glycoprotein(s) having the lectin

attached thereto; and separating and measuring
glycoprotein(s) having the first antibody attached

thereto and glycoprotein(s) having no first antibody
attached thereto, by utilizing differences in properties

between the former glycoprotein(s) and the latter glycoprotein(s).
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the
first antibody has, as a substance attached thereto, a

substance capable of changing properties of a complex of
glycoprotein(s) to be measured and the first antibody,

or a labeling substance.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein a
second antibody which has an ability to bind to all

the glycoproteins to be measured including glycoprotein(s)
having the lectin attached thereto and has a

labeling substance attached thereto is used together
with the lectin and the first antibody. 
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the
glycoproteins to be measured are previously treated with

glycosidase, or glycosidase is present at the time of
reacting the glycoproteins with the lectin, and the

A process according to Claim 3, wherein the

A process according to Claim 1, wherein the

concentration of the first antibody is
