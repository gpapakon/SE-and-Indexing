<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a rinse aid composition containing a 
chelant component selected from ethylenediamine 

disuccinic acid ethylenediamine diglutaric acid 
(EDDG), 2 hydroxypropylenediamine-disuccinic acid 

(HPDDS) or any of the salts or complexes of said 
chelant components. The pH of said composition as a 

1% solution in distilled water at 20
o
C is preferably 
less than 7.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rinsing (rinse aid)
compositions, particularly acidic rinsing compositions
containing an ethylenediamine disuccinic acid
component. The invention also relates to the use of a
chelant component in the rinse cycle of a dishwashing machine.Rinse aid compositions designed for use in automatic
dishwasher machines are well known. These compositions are
added during the rinsing cycle of the machine, separately
from the detergent composition employed in the main wash
cycle(s). The ability to enhance rinsing, and in
particular the ability to prevent spot and film formation
are common measures of rinse aid performance.Rinse aid compositions typically contain components
such as nonionic surfactants and/or hydrotropes which
aid the wetting of the items in the rinse, thereby
improving the efficacy of the rinsing process. These
surfactants, and rinse aid compositions in general,
are not designed for the achievement of a primary soil
removal purpose. The Applicants have found that certain resistant
soils/stains, especially bleachable soils/stains, most
especially tea stains, can remain on tableware, especially
chinaware at the end of the wash cycle of an automatic
dishwashing machine.The Applicants have also found that said resistant
soils/stains, especially tea stains on chinaware, may
'recolourise' under the conditions of the rinse, thereby
enhancing the colour of the soils/stains.The Applicants have found that the inclusion of certain
chelants having disuccinic or diglutaric acid components
into said rinse aid formulation enhances the removal of
said resistant soils/stains from the tableware during the
rinse cycle. The problem of stain recolourisation is thus
also avoided. The removal of tea stains from chinaware is
particularly enhanced.The Applicants have also found that the inclusion of said
chelants having disuccinic acid or diglutaric acid
components into the rinse aid formulations reduces the
propensity for the leaching out of any silicious material
constituents of the articles in the wash. Hence improved
china and glassware properties are provided.The chelants themselves and their use in detergent compositions are
disclosed in WO-A-92/09680, EP-A-0267653, US-A-3158635 and
WO-A-94/20599, published on 15.09.94.There is provided a rinse aid composition containing a
chelant component selected from ethylenediamine
disuccinic acid, ethylenediamine diglutaric acid
(EDDG), 2 hydroxypropylenediamine-disuccinic acid
(HPDDS) or any of the salts or complexes of said
chelant components,
