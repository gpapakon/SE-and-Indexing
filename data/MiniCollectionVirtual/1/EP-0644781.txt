<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a tissue equivalent is described. A length of polyester tube is threaded over a mandrel (H) and attached at either end by clips at A and D. A block (F) is then screwed into place. The polyester is then pre-soaked by injecting through Tap (2) an acidified collagen solution for approximately one hour. After a suitable period of time the excess solution is aspirated off. Following this stage, a second, alkaline solution is injected into the apparatus which contains smooth muscle cells (SMC). Thus, neutralisation of the collagen impregnated within the fabric of the tube occurs leading to spontaneous fibrillogenesis within the interstices of the cloth, eliminating the risk of delamination. The apparatus is then incubated. The collagen contracts down onto the fabric tube and the cell-impregnated gel becomes incorporated into the presoaked collagen. The pre-impregnated collagen and the collagen provided in the aqueous mixture contract down as one into a coherent whole with the SMC. The tissue equivalent is then lined with endothelial cells and the apparatus again incubated and fed at increasing intraluminal pressures applied either statically or dynamically. This is believed to cause the vessel to become preconditioned to the pressure it will work under as an implant. This allows organisation of the basement membrane which in turn promotes EC attachment and theoretically prevents smooth muscle cell hyperplasia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with the creation of tissue
equivalents and methods for their preparation. Although
reference will be made hereinafter to the preparation of
vascular grafts, it should be understood that the present
invention has applications to various other tissue
equivalents, for instance heart valves. The invention has
application to a suitable implantable or reconstructive
material with an active cellular lining, for example
endothelial, whether autologous or not.There are a number of clinical situations in which implants
are required. A vascular graft may be desirable in order
to replace a section of vessel damage during trauma, or to
bypass vessels exhibiting occlusive diseases, for instance,
for coronary artery bypass. The two major alternatives
available for vascular grafting are the use of an
autologous vessel from elsewhere in the body, or the use of
biological or synthetic prostheses. Both alternatives have
drawbacks. The former may be surgically time consuming and
availability limited. Prosthetic materials, while
surgically convenient, have a number of performance
disadvantages.Coronary artery bypass grafting remains the most effective
longer term treatment for coronary artery disease. Since
the introduction of the bypass technique, many different
types of vascular grafts have been evaluated. The most
obvious source of a vascular conduit is autologous vein or
artery removed or transposed from elsewhere in the body.
Saphenous vein and internal mammary artery have been used.
Saphenous vein conduits suffer from early thrombotic
occlusion and also from late failures so that more than 50%
have occluded by 10 years. A major drawback with the use
of autologous material is that, when occlusion does occur, 
there is often insufficient autologous conduit left for re-operations.
This is particularly relevant when multiple
bypass operations are required. Alternatively, saphenous
vein may be unavailable, for instance, due to varicosities.Artificial prostheses constructed from such diverse
materials as woven Dacron(TM), Gore-Tex(TM) and expanded
microporous polytetrafluoroethylene all suffer to a greater
or lesser extent from thrombus formation. Attention has
therefore turned towards biological grafts of non-autologous
origin.Allograft veins and arteries from post mortem donors have
been used with variable success. However, reliance on this
source is unlikely to fulfil demand. To overcome this
availability problem, the use of human umbilical veins and
arteries has been considered.

A method of forming a tissue equivalent comprising
impregnating a fibrous substrate with collagen

fibrils, applying to the impregnated substrate an
aqueous mixture of collagen fibrils, a nutrient medium

and a cellular contractile agent, and incubating the
system to allow a gel to form from the aqueous mixture

and to contract and express aqueous medium therefrom.
A method according to claim 1 in which preimpregnating
the fibrous substrate comprises soaking the substrate

in an acidic aqueous collagen solution.

mixture of collagen fibrils, a nutrient medium and a

cellular contractile agent is alkaline.

cellular contractile agent comprises smooth muscle

cells.
A method according to any preceding claim including
