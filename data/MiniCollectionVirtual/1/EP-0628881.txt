<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel organic photoconductive
material and a photosensitive material for electronic photography using
it. More particularly, the present invention relates to an organic
photoconductive material comprising a specific azo compound and a
novel photosensitive material for electronic photography comprising a
photosensitive layer containing it.Recently, electronic photography has been adopted not only in the
field of photocopier but also widely in the fields where photographic
technology has been used, such as printing form plates, slide films,
microfilms and the like. Application to high speed printing using
RASER, LED or CRT as the light source is also being developed.
Application of electronic photosensitive materials to fields other than the
photosensitive materials for electronic photography, such as electrostatic
recording elements, sensor materials and the like, is also a subject of
recent studies. Therefore, requirements for electronic photoconductive
materials and photosensitive materials for electronic photography using
them are becoming higher in degree and wider in range.Materials comprising a photosensitive layer containing an 
inorganic photoconductive material, such as amorphous selenium,
cadmium sulfide, zinc oxide and the like, as the main component thereof
have been used mainly as the photosensitive material for electronic
photography. Even though the photoconductive materials using
inorganic materials are useful, they are not always satisfactory with
respect of sensitivity, heat stability, moisture resistance and durability.
Particularly, they have problems on handling during production because
of toxicity of amorphous selenium and cadmium sulfide.Photosensitive materials for electronic photography using various
kinds of organic photoconductive materials have been proposed and
adopted in practical applications as materials having no such problems.
Obviously, a photosensitive material for electronic photography is
required to have the function of carrier generation and the function of
carrier transportation. Various kinds of organic pigments, such as
phthalocyanine pigments, multi-ring quinone pigments, indigo
pigments, dioxadine pigments, quinacridone pigments, azo pigments
and the like, have been proposed as organic materials used as the carrier
generating substance but only limited kinds of them have been
practically applied. Only limited kinds of the carrier transporting
substance have also been practically applied. Therefore, it is the actual
situation
