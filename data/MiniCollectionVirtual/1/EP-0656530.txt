<ABSTRACT>
A multi-point cell type weighing machine has a plural 
number of scale cells (1,2) set on a floor (5) to support 

a table (10) and to output weight signals indicative of 
weights measured thereby of a target object placed on the 

table. One or more floor vibration detecting cells (16) 
are set on the same floor and output floor vibration 

detection signals indicative of the vibrations of the 
floor. The weight signals are corrected on the basis of 

vibration components of the floor vibration detection 
signals. A standard weight is placed at a larger plural 

number of places on the table (10) than there are scale 
cells and output sensitivity ratios among the scale cells 

are calculated from outputted values from the scale cells, 
and the weight signals are further corrected on the basis 

of the output sensitivity ratios. These weight signals are 
added together and the weight of the target object is 

obtained from the added signal. A plurality of floor 

vibration detecting cells may be set on the floor, each 
near different one of the scale cells, or they may be set 

anywhere on the floor and a mode of floor vibrations may be 
calculated from their outputs. A single floor vibration 

detecting cell may be set between the scale cells. The 
table is supported by the scale cells through elastic 

pieces such that only vertical forces are communicated to 
the scale cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a weighing machine of the so-called
multi-point cell type having a weighing
table supported by a plurality of scale cells in which the weight signals
from these scale cells are added to measure the weight of
a target object placed on the weighing table. In particular,
this invention relates to such a machine capable of high-speed
weighing.Weighing machines of the multi-point cell type, as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Publication Tokko 63-285941, have been in
use for measuring the weight of a large or heavy target
object, such as an automobile, by supporting a weighing table
by a plurality of weighing cells and adding the weight signals
outputted from the individual cells. Compared to weighing
machines with only one cell adapted to measure the entire
weight of a target object, weighing machines of the multiple-point
cell type are advantageous because the size of the
weighing table can be made larger since many weighing cells of
about the same size can be used to support it. The scale
cells are typically comprised of a deformable body with strain
gauges attached thereon. When such a weighing machine is used to measure the weight of
a target object moving on a weighing conveyor, mechanical
vibrations are caused to the plurality of scale cells due, for
example, to the shock associated with the shift of the weight
of the target object from a conveyor for its transportation to
the weighing conveyor. In view of the above, it has been
known, as shown in Fig. 13, to use amplifiers 22, filters
(with cutoff frequency 5Hz-10Hz) 27 and A/D converters 24 to
process weight signals outputted from a plurality of scale
cells 1 and 2, to add these processed signals together by a
CPU 25 and to thereafter extract a filtered signal with its
high-frequency vibration components attenuated. This process
is illustrated in Fig. 14.It takes, however, a significantly long time (referred to as
the stabilization time S), say, of about 200msec until such a
filtered signal becomes stabilized, and this has indeed been a
source of problem in the attempt to achieve high-speed
weighing. In view of the above, it has been known to carry
out a stabilization routine on weight data in order to speed
up a weighing process. For example, if there is a set of
time-sequenced signal values a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, ... , a
final equilibrium value to which the signal values are
expected to converge, may be predicted by first taking the
average of a1, a2 and a3, next taking the average of a2, a3
and a4, then taking the average
