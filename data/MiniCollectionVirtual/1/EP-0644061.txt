<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dye donor elements
used in thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to
the use of a certain subbing layer for a slipping layer
on the back side thereof, the subbing layer having
antistatic properties.In recent years, thermal transfer systems
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures
which have been generated electronically from a color
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to
color separation by color filters. The respective
color-separated images are then converted into
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals.
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal
printing head has many heating elements and is heated
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a
screen. Further details of this process and an
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S.
Patent No. 4,621,271.A slipping layer is usually provided on the
backside of the dye-donor element to prevent sticking
to the thermal head during printing. A subbing layer 
is also usually needed to promote adhesion between the
support and the slipping layer.For media transport and handling, an
antistatic layer is usually needed in a dye-donor
element, since there is dust accumulation on a
statically charged surface and potential sparking which
may destroy heating elements in the thermal head. The
antistatic material is usually located in or over the
slipping layer of the dye-donor element.U.S. Patent No. 4,753,921 discloses the use
of a titanium alkoxide as a subbing layer between a
polyester support and a slipping layer. While this
material is a good subbing layer for adhesion, problems
have arisen with hydrolytic instability, and the layer
is difficult to coat in a reproducible manner. It has
also been observed that the titanium alkoxide may
migrate to the slipping layer surface causing sticking
to the thermal head.U.S. Patent 5,106,694 and Research Disclosure
