<ABSTRACT>
A method for inhibiting calcium sulfate scale formation 
and deposition and/or dispersing iron from a feedstream 

passing through a reverse osmosis system which comprises the 
steps of: controlling the pH of the feedstream within the 

range between about 6.0 to about 7.0; controlling the 
temperature of the feedstream within the range between about 

50 to about 80°F; and adding a scale inhibitor and/or iron 
dispersant to the feedstream in an amount between about 

0.002 ppm per ppm hardness (as CaCO₃) of the feedstream to 
about 0.005 ppm per ppm hardness (as CaCO₃) of the 

feedstream, the scale inhibitor and/or iron dispersant 
comprising a water-soluble organic phosphonate, an N-substituted 

acrylamide polymer, caustic and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
A method for inhibiting calcium sulfate scale formation
and deposition and/or dispersing iron from a feedstream
passing through a reverse osmosis system which comprises the
steps of: controlling the pH of the feedstream; controlling
the temperature of the feedstream; and adding a scale
inhibitor and/or iron dispersant which comprises an acrylic
acid/acrylamide/acrylamidomethylsulphonic acid terpolymer, a
phosphonate, caustic and water to the feedstream.Purification of water by reverse osmosis (RO) is
growing in popularity. Specifically, it is used for
seawater desalination, potable water production, cooling
tower make-up, process water generation, boiler feedwater
pretreatment and the like. It offers the advantages of
removing both organic and inorganic contaminants to yield
water which is up to 98% pure. If ion exchange polishing is
used downstream of the RO unit, it also saves money by
reducing the frequency of demineralizer regenerations and
their associated waste disposal costs.The RO process consists of using pressure to drive
water through a semipermeable membrane. As the pure water 
(permeate) passes through the salt rejecting layer of the
membrane, the remaining water (retentate) is enriched in
contaminants. A turbulence promoter, present within the
membrane module, helps prevent the formation of large
concentration gradients within the unit. Nevertheless, next
to the barrier layer, an area of concentration polarization
develops, and the concentrations of common scale forming
salts such as CaCO3 and CaSO4 often exceed their solubility
limits and precipitate on the surface. In addition, the
presence of insoluble iron fines may also foul the membrane
surface. Such scaling and fouling decreases the production
of pure water. To regain the product water flow, higher
driving pressures are necessary, which result in increased
energy costs and potential damage to the membranes.A significant operating cost factor of a reverse
osmosis system is the cost of the membranes themselves.
With proper care membranes can last for years before
replacement becomes necessary. If the membranes experience
fouling by deposits of material on their surface, this may
result in increased energy consumption, or membrane failure
which would ultimately cause an unscheduled shutdown and
significant replacement costs. Most RO systems incorporate
some type of pretreatment system consisting of filters to
remove suspended matter which minimizes fouling. Also,
chemical addition is often required to inhibit scaling.
