<ABSTRACT>
A device for sorting chips (3) on gaming tables has a conveyor, arranged underneath the gaming table, for the chips (3) which are inserted via an insertion orifice (2), the conveyor guiding the chips (3) past a reading head recognising their type, and the reading head controlling the feed of the chips (3) into chip cylinders (1) which are provided with centring members (8) and in each of which is guided a jack (4) which deposits the chips (3) in a stack above the table. In order to simplify the centring of the chips (3) in the chip cylinder (4), the centring members are designed as curved centring bodies, preferably as balls (8) which project through essentially uniformly distributed orifices in the chip cylinder (1) into the latter and which are held resiliently.

Device for sorting chips on gaming-tables, with a 
conveyor, arranged below the gaming-table, for the 

chips inserted via a slot, the conveyor leading the 
chips past a read head which recognises their type and 

controls the delivery of the chips into chip cylinders 
(1) provided with centering members (8), in each of 

which cylinders a lifting device (4) is guided, which 
deposits the chips (3) in a pile on the table, 


characterised in that
 the centering members are 
designed as curved centering bodies, preferably spheres 

(8), which project into the chip cylinder (1) through 
apertures distributed substantially evenly round the 

circumference of same and are held by springs. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
at least two rows (5, 6, 7) of centering bodies (8) are 

disposed the one above the other, the upper row (5) 
projecting further into the chip cylinder (1) than the 

lower row (6). 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 
two rows (5, 6) of centering bodies (8) are disposed 

the one just above the other with a third row at a 
greater interval below them, the lowermost (7) and 

middle (6) rows projecting the same distance into the  
 

chip cylinder (7) and the slot (2) for pushing the 
chips into being arranged between the lower and middle 

rows. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 leaf springs (10) adjoin the 
centering bodies (8) on the outside.
