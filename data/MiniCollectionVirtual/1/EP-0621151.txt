<ABSTRACT>
A guide-support (1) for motor vehicle tarpaulin, such as typically 
trucks 

and vans, is provided at the top with a substantially C-shaped 
portion (2) 

facing the vehicle center-line which is capable of carrying out the 
double 

function of support for the crossbars (7) of a fixed roof or of guide 
for the 

supporting carriages (10) of the crossbars of a mobile roof (8). The 
guide-support 

lower portion consists of two C-shaped rails (9) facing downwards side 
by 

side, obtained from a single sheet directly drawn with the shape which is 
usually obtained by welding together two single rails.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns tarpaulin supporting structures for 
motor vehicles and in particular a guide-support for tarpaulins which can 
be used to obtain both fixed and mobile roofs. It is known that truck tarpaulins are secured on horizontal crossbars 
which form the roof frame and may be either of the fixed type or of the 
type sliding in the longitudinal direction of the body. Prior art structures 
used to obtain fixed roofs are different from those used for mobile roofs. 
They usually have an upper portion with a square or rectangular cross-section, 
and a lower portion provided with one or two C-shaped rails 
facing downwards which act as a support for carriages carrying the 
tarpaulin on the body side and possible internal posts. For example, GB-A-2168011 discloses a guide-support for a motor vehicle tarpaulin including an upper portion and 
a lower portion, said lower portion consisting of one rail for carriages. The upper portion of this guide-support is made up 
of two sections welded together and forming a structure which is therefore weaker and more difficult to manufacture than 
a box-like structure made of a single section. In GB-A-2071582 is disclosed a guide-support whose lower portion consists 
of two coupled rails for carriages, according to the preamble of claim 1. 
However, said coupled rails are manufactured separately and welded together along 
their central web, which thus becomes the only portion of the double-rail structure having double thickness. There are apparent drawbacks of practical and economical nature 
deriving from the use of two different types of supporting members for the 
two types of roof, as well as from the need of a working to obtain a lower 
double rail. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to overcome the 
above-described drawbacks by providing a guide-support capable of 
carrying out the double function of support for the crossbars of fixed roofs, 
or of guide for those of mobile roofs, and which is also provided with a 
stronger lower double rail obtained from a single piece, thereby not 
requiring further working. This object is achieved by means of a guide-support having the 
characteristics cited in claim 1. The main advantage of said guide-support is, therefore, that of being 
universally usable for both types of roof, as well as that of allowing to 
realize a partially fixed and partially mobile roof. A further advantage of the guide-support according to the present 
invention stems from the greater strength of the lower double rail
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A guide-support for motor vehicle tarpaulin including an upper 
portion fixed onto a lower portion, said lower portion consisting of one or two supporting rails 

(9) for carriages (10), characterized in that the upper portion is made up of a 
single section (1) bent so as to form a substantially C-shaped channel (2) 

whose open side faces 
the vehicle center-line and a box-like structure (3) facing outwards, 

said channel (2) being provided at the top with a substantially horizontal segment 
of wall (5) having holes for the passage of bolts (6) for mounting fixed 

crossbars (7). 
A guide-support according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
lower portion consists of a single section (8) bent so as to form two side 

by side rails (9) each one provided with two tracks (20), a central one and 
an outer one, for the sliding of carriages (10), said section (8) having a 

double thickness on the central web (11) and on the lower central portion 
(12) which connects said rails (9) and forms the central tracks (20). 
A guide-support according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
central tracks (20) of the two rails (9) are positioned at a higher level with 

respect to the outer tracks (20).
