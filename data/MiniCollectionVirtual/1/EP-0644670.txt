<ABSTRACT>
A line setting and phase adjusting apparatus for 
synchronous multiplex communications is provided which 

adjusts phase differences of main signals caused between a 
plurality of synchronous multiplexing sections and a line 

setting section during line setting, in which to reduce the 
scale of circuitry of the line setting section in a transmission 

device for carrying out multiplexing and line 
setting on large-capacity signals, a plurality of pointer 

modifiers (13-15) are arranged on a shelf (4) on which the line setting 
section is arranged. The pointer modifiers (13-15) connect the 

line setting section to the respective synchronous multiplexing 
sections. The pointer modifiers (13-15) are supplied with 

multiplexed signals of respective signal series whose data 
head positions are shifted from one another. The head 

positions of these signals are synchronized with a timing 
signal from a timing generator (12) by the pointer modifiers. 

Line switching is then effected by time switches (5-7, 9-11) and a 
space switch (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a line setting 
and phase adjusting apparatus for synchronous multiplex 
communications which is capable of adjusting phase differences 
of main signals caused between a line setting unit 
and a respective synchronous multiplexing unit during a 
line setting operation, and more particularly, to a line 
setting and phase adjusting apparatus for synchronous 
multiplex communications, which is used for the line setting 
of main signals in a transmission device having a line 
setting function according to SONET (Synchronous Optical 
NETwork) or SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). With the recent development of communications 
technology, the amount of signals dealt with in synchronous 
networks keeps on increasing on a worldwide scale. 
Accordingly, the amount of signals subjected to 
multiplexing or line setting (line switching) in a 
transmission device is also increasing, and situations are 
expected where a synchronous multiplexing section and a 
line setting section of the transmission system cannot be 
incorporated in the same shelf due to a circuitry scale.  
 
In such situations, a plurality of synchronous multiplexing 
units and a line setting unit must be set on separate 
shelves. In a conventional transmission device in a 
synchronous network, multiplexing and line setting of 
small-capacity signals can be carried out by a synchronous 
multiplexing section and a line setting section, both 
arranged on a single shelf, as shown in FIG. 1. Specifically, 
the synchronous multiplexing section comprises, for 
example, three multiplexers (MUXs) 51 to 53, three pointer 
modifiers 54 to 56 connected to the respective multiplexers, 
and a timing generator 57 the output of which is 
inputted to the pointer multiplexers 54-56, and the line 
setting section comprises six time switches (T-SW) 58 to 60 
each being interconnected to the respective pointer modifier 
of the synchronous multiplexing section switches 62 to 
64 and a space switch (S-SW) 61. The multiplexers 51 to 53 are each supplied with 
signals of n channels (CH1 to CHn) for multiplexing from a 
low-level hierarchy device at the same bit rate. It is 
here assumed that three series (#1 to #3) of multiplexed 
signals are to be obtained. FIG. 2(A) schematically illustrates the frame 
structure of n-channel signals supplied to each multiplexers 
of Fig. 1. The illustrated example uses a VT frame; 
and in the figure, each block consists of one byte, and V1  
 
and DT1 each represent the data name of the corresponding 
b
