<ABSTRACT>
A guidewire replacement device (10) having an elongated catheter shaft with an inner lumen (15) extending within the catheter shaft, a proximal guidewire port (14) spaced at least 1 cm from the distal end of the catheter which is in fluid communication with the inner lumen and distal guidewire port in the distal end of the catheter which is also in fluid communication with the inner lumen. The proximal end of an in-place guidewire (28) is inserted through the distal guidewire port (14) and advanced through the inner lumen until the proximal end of the guidewire extends through the proximal guidewire port. The exchange device is advanced over the guidewire. With the distal end of the exchange device well seated within the proximal guidewire port of the dilatation catheter (27), the in-place guidewire can be withdrawn from the patient. A replacement guidewire (21) is advanced through the inner lumen of the exchange device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to intravascular procedures, such as
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and particularly to the exchange
of guidewires during such procedures.In classic PTCA procedures, a guiding catheter having a preshaped distal
tip is percutaneously introduced into the cardiovascular system of a patient and advanced
therein until the preshaped distal tip thereof is disposed within the aorta adjacent the
ostium of the desired coronary artery. The guiding catheter is twisted or torqued from its
proximal end, which extends outside of the patient, to turn the distal tip of the guiding
catheter so that it can be guided into the coronary ostium and seated therein. A dilatation
catheter having a dilatation balloon on the distal end thereof and a guidewire slidably
disposed within an inner lumen of the dilatation catheter are introduced into and advanced
through the proximal end of the guiding catheter to the distal tip of the guiding catheter
seated within the coronary ostium. The distal tip of the guidewire is usually manually
shaped (curved) by the physician or one of the attendants before it is introduced into the
guiding catheter along with the dilatation catheter.The shaped distal tip of the guidewire is first advanced out the distal tip of
the guiding catheter into the patient's coronary artery. A torque is applied to the proximal
end of the guidewire, which extends out of the proximal end of the guiding catheter as it
is advanced within the coronary anatomy, to guide the curved or otherwise shaped distal 
end of the guidewire into a branch artery targeted for dilatation. The advancement of the
guidewire within the target artery continues until it crosses the lesion to be dilated.The dilatation catheter is then advanced out of the distal tip of the guiding
catheter, over the previously advanced guidewire, until the balloon on the distal extremity
of the dilatation catheter is properly positioned across the lesion to be dilated. Once
properly positioned across the lesion, the flexible, relatively inelastic dilatation balloon on
the catheter is inflated to a predetermined size with radiopaque liquid at relatively high
pressures (e.g., generally 4-12 atmospheres) to dilate the stenosed region of the diseased
artery. One or more inflations of the balloon may be required to complete the dilatation
of the stenosis. After the last dilatation, the balloon is deflated so that the dilatation
catheter can be removed from the dilated stenosis and so that blood flow can resume
