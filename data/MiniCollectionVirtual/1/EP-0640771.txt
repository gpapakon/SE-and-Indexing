<ABSTRACT>
A blind rivet includes a tubular shell (10) formed with 
an enlarged head (11) and a shank (12), and a mandrel (20) formed with a 

stem (22) and an enlarged head (21). The shell (10) and mandrel (20) are 
insertable from one side of a plurality of members to be 

fastened together through aligned openings such that a pull 
force applied to the mandrel (20) from that side causes the shell 

shank (12) to bulge outwardly, and thereby to securely fasten the 
members between the shell head (11) and the bulged portion of the 

shell shank (12) . The mandrel (20) includes 
two gripping portions (23,25) 

axially spaced from the mandrel head (21) and each other by 
bridging portions (24,26) of smaller diameter than the gripping 

portions (23,25) such that the shank (12) is firmly gripped by the outer 
surfaces of the two gripping portions (23,25) when the mandrel (20) is 

pulled to outwardly bulge the shell shank (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fastening devices 
for fastening a plurality of members together, and 
particularly to a blind rivet which enables a plurality of 
members to be fastened together where access is available 
only from one side of the members. The conventional blind rivet comprises a tubular 
shell formed with an enlarged head at one end and a shank at 
its opposite end, and a mandrel formed with a stem at one 
end and an enlarged head at its opposite end. The shell and 
mandrel are insertable from one side of a plurality of 
members to be fastened together through aligned openings in 
the members, with the shell head engaging the one side of 
the members and with the mandrel head engaging the end of 
the shell shank at the opposite side of the members. The 
construction is such that a pull force applied to the 
mandrel from the one side of the members in the direction to 
axially compress the shell shank by the mandrel head, causes 
the shell shank to bulge outwardly, and thereby to securely 
fasten the plurality of members between the shell head and 
the bulged portion of the shell shank. Examples of such 
known blind rivet constructions are described in US Patents 
2,030,167, 2,030,168, 2,030,169, 2,061,628, 3,149,530, 
3,286,580, 3,414,965, 3,515,028, 4,189,977, 4,222,304 and 
4,639,174. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
blind rivet of the foregoing type having an improved 
gripping action between the mandrel and the shell. Another 
object of the invention is to provide a blind rivet of a 
relatively simple construction which can be produced in 
volume and at low cost. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a blind rivet of the construction described above, 
characterized in that the mandrel includes a first gripping 
portion axially spaced from the mandrel head by a first 
bridging portion; and a second gripping portion axially  
 
spaced from the first gripping portion by a second bridging 
portion; the outer diameters of the first and second 
bridging portions being smaller than the outer diameters of 
the first and second gripping portions such that the shank 
is firmly gripped by the outer surfaces of the two gripping 
portions axially spaced from each other by the second 
bridging portion when the mandrel is pulled to axially 
compress the shell shank. Such a blind rivet thus produces a double gripping 
action between the mandrel and the shell, which more 
securely fixes the mandrel to the shell. According to further features in the described 
pre

A blind rivet, comprising: a tubular shell 
formed with an enlarged head at one end and a shank at its 

opposite end; and a mandrel formed with a stem at one end 
and an enlarged head at its opposite end; said shell and 

mandrel being insertable from one side of a plurality of 
members to be fastened together through aligned openings in 

said members, with the shell head engaging said one side of 
the members and with the mandrel head engaging the end of 

the shell shank at the opposite side of the members, such 
that a pull force applied to said mandrel from said one side 

of the members in the direction to axially compress the 
shell shank by the mandrel head, causes the shell shank to 

bulge outwardly, and thereby to securely fasten the 
plurality of members between the shell head and the bulged 

portion of the shell shank; 
   characterized in that said mandrel includes: 

   a first gripping portion axially spaced from the 
mandrel head by a first bridging portion; 

   and a second gripping portion axially spaced from 
the first gripping portion by a second bridging portion; 

   the outer diameters of said first and second 
bridging portions being smaller than the outer diameters of 

said first and second gripping portions such that the shank 
is firmly gripped by the outer surfaces of the two gripping 

portions axially spaced from each other by said second 
bridging portion when the mandrel is pulled to axially 

compress the shell shank. 
The blind rivet according to Claim 1, wherein 
the outer diameters of said first and second gripping 

portions are substantially the same as or slightly smaller 
than the inner diameter of said shell shank. 
The blind rivet according to either of Claims 
1 or 2, wherein said shell is formed with a juncture portion 

between its enlarged head and shank, said juncture portion 
having an inner diameter smaller than the outer diameter of 

said gripping portion and located with respect thereto such 
 

that, when the mandrel is pulled to axially compress the 
shell shank and to bulge it outwardly, the second gripping 

portion is forcefully moved axially into said juncture 
portion and is firmly gripped thereby. 
The blind rivet according to any one of Claims 
1-3, wherein the inner surface of said mandrel head is 

inwardly dished such that, when the mandrel is pulled to 
axially compress the shell shank and to bulge it outwardly, 

the end of the shank is forcefully deformed radially 
inwardly into firm contact with said first bridging 

portion. 
The blind rivet according to any one of Claims 
1-4, wherein the outer surfaces of both of said gripping 

portions are formed with gripping ribs. 
The blind rivet according to Claim 5, wherein 
said gripping ribs in said first and second gripping 

portions extend axially of their respective gripping 
portions and are circumferentially spaced from each other. 
The blind rivet according to any one of Claims 
1-6, wherein said mandrel further includes a stem having a 

break-point connection to said second gripping portion to be 
broken away after the mandrel is pulled to axially compress 

the shell shank and to bulge it outwardly. 
The blind rivet according to Claim 7, wherein 
said break-point connection is located such that the end of 

said second gripping portion is recessed within said shank 
head when the stem has been broken away from the remainder 

of the mandrel. 
The blind rivet according to either of Claims 
7 or 8, wherein said stem is formed with circumferentially-extending, 

axially-spaced gripping ribs. 
The blind rivet according to any one of Claims 
1-9, wherein said first and second bridging portions are of 

substantially the same outer diameters.
