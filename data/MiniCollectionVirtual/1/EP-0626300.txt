<ABSTRACT>
A cart for the collection and transportation of rubbish in 
general, particularly suitable for use for gardening, comprises 

an upper tubular element (5) and a lower tubular element (6) 
forming an operating handle and a supporting base, 

respectively, and a coupling ring (15) for a collection bag 
mechanically coupled to said upper tubular element (5). The 

cart also comprises a pair of supporting sides (1), each 
provided with a succession of lightening holes (2), with 

reinforcing ribs (7), with a pair of seats (3) suitable for 
allowing the introduction and the clamping of the ends (4) of 

said upper (5) and lower (6) tubular elements, and with a 
through hole (8) for the insertion and the clamping of a shaft 

(9) for supporting a pair of wheels (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cart for the collection 
of rubbish in general and its transportation over uneven 
terrain, particularly suitable for use in gardening. In the British patent No. 2177895 in the name of CLABER 
S.p.A. there is described a cart for the collection and 
transportation of leaves and rubbish in general constituted by 
two parts, that can be joined together by means of two 
connection joints, forming a tubular supporting structure, 
wherein the upper part forms an operating handle and has a ring 
for coupling a collection bag, while to the lower one there is 
fastened, by means of clamps, the common shaft of a pair of 
wheels. A similar device is disclosed in GB-A-2 078 633. In a similar sector, represented by devices for winding up 
irrigation hoses, the tendency has been developing to provide 
structures comprising a central supporting part, usually made 
in plastic material, to which tubular elements are coupled 
constituting handles or grips and supporting bases. In the European patent application No. 0 525 868 
there is 
described a supporting side for a hose-winding drum of a device 
for winding flexible hose, provided with seats for the 
introduction of ends of handle and base elements, and a snap 
coupling for a shaft supporting a pair of wheels. The use of such sides for making rubbish-carrying carts as 
well appears to be of considerable interest, as it allows a  
 
reduction in design costs. However, due to the type of coupling of the shaft supporting 
the wheels, the use on uneven terrain, such as for example 
stone surfaces, can cause the shaft itself to come out of its 
seat and the consequent detachment of one or both wheels and 
the possibility of the rubbish container to tip over. In view of the described state of the art, the object of the 
present invention is to provide a rubbish-carrying cart that 
uses the same solutions adopted for hose-winding devices, 
without, however, exhibiting the mentioned drawbacks. According to the present invention, such object is attained 
thanks to a cart for the collection band transportation of 
rubbish in general, as defined in claim 1. In a preferred embodiment, said bag coupling ring is  
 
provided with a cover that can be tipped over, having a shape 
such that its centre of gravity rotates correspondingly going 
from one side to the other of its axis of rotation, so as to 
obtain a stable open position. Thanks to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a 
reliable rubbish cart, that exploits solutions common

<CLAIMS>
Cart for the collection and transportation of rubbish in 
general, comprising an upper tubular element (5) and a lower 

tubular element (6) forming an operating handle and a 
supporting base, respectively, a coupling ring (15) for a 

collection bag mechanically coupled to said upper tubular 
element (5), and a pair of 

supporting sides (1), each provided 
with a pair of 

seats (3) suitable for allowing the introduction and the 
clamping of the ends (4) of said upper (5) and lower (6) tubular elements, 

characterized in that each supporting side (1) is provided 
with a succession of lightening holes (2) and reinforcing ribs (7) 

and with a through hole (8) for the insertion and the clamping of a shaft (9) for supporting a 
pair of wheels (10), and 

said coupling ring (15) of the bag is coupled to the upper tubular 
element (5) by means of a pair of sleeves (16) that can slide 

vertically along vertical rectilinear sections (17) of the 
latter's, so as to be able to adjust the distance of the ring 

(15) itself from the supporting base (6) to accept collection 
bags having a variable height. 
Cart according to claim 1, characterized in that inside 
said through hole (8) of each supporting side (1) there is a 

pin (13) suitable for inserting itself in a corresponding slit 
(14) obtained in said supporting shaft (9) so as to prevent the 

latter's axial sliding movement. 
Cart according to claim 1, characterized in that each of 
said sleeves (16) is provided with a lever (18) rotatable and 

integral with a cam (19) co-operating with the wall of said 
vertical sections (17) to prevent the sliding movement of the  

 
sleeves (16) themselves. 
Cart according to claim 1, characterized in that said bag 
coupling ring (15) is provided with a cover (21) that can be 

tipped over, having a shape such that its centre of gravity 
rotates correspondingly going from one side to the other of its 

axis of rotation, so as to obtain a stable open position.
