<ABSTRACT>
In a method for reducing the bit error rate in the transmission of digital data by radio by means of an m-channel radio system, the bit error rate is reduced according to the invention in that first the transmitted data signals are extracted from the received signals with carrier in the individual m receiving channels, then the data clock rate is determined and the data signals and the data clock rate are used for calculating a cross correlation for each data bit. Following this, the resultant cross correlation values of the individual receiving channels are compared with one another for each data bit. For the further processing of the data bit, the one of the m receiving channels which has the highest cross correlation value for this data bit is selected. In order to be able to carry out the method, the received signals are in each case supplied to a diversity switch via a bit synchroniser (which determines the data clock rate) and to a cross correlator (belonging to the channel) in the individual receiving channels. In a comparison and control unit, the resultant correlation values of the individual channels are compared with one another. The receiving channel having the best correlation value is then switched to the evaluating circuit via the diversity switch.

another for each data bit or for some of the data bits

for the further processing of the data bit(s), the
receiving channel from among the m receiving channels

that has the highest cross-correlation value for that
data bit or those data bits is selected.
