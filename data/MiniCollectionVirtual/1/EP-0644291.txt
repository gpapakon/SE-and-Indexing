<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A known method determines laundry-specific parameters, such as the introduced dry laundry mass, the water level and the bound liquor, by means of a float-actuated or diaphragm-actuated mechanical linkage, to the end of which an iron core guided in a coil is attached. Rising water levels and the mechanical lowering of the tub mounted on shock absorbers induce in the coil electrical quantities which are fed to an evaluation circuit. 2.2 The method according to the invention determines during the reversing mode, specifically solely in the drum standstill times (ts), the lye quantity (L1, L2) expressed from the laundry and running back into the tank and its outflow velocities (v1, v2), by means of an electronic analogue pressure cell. Its output signals

 are compared with other quantities and information relating to the introduced laundry quantity and the type of laundry is obtained therefrom. 2.3 The method is suitable for optimizing washing programmes in electronically controlled domestic washing machines.
