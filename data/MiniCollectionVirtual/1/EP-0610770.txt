least a third transistor (3, 2, 1; 6, 5, 4)

are connected to one another and are connected via 

a respective current source (7; 8) to a terminal for 
a first supply potential (VEE),

each group are connected to one another and are 
connected via a first resistor (11) to a terminal 

for a second supply potential (VCC),
