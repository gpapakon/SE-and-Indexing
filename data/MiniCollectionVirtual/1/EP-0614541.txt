<ABSTRACT>
Overhead head-up display systems that has an image display source located above the operator of a vehicle. The display source may be mounted off-axis or in-line with the operator's forward viewing direction depending on the vehicle passenger compartment configuration. The image display source and a spherical (or aspheric) optical combiner are used to display sensor and communications data at an optimum viewing location. A roof mounted overhead head-up display is ideal for retrofitting a vehicle passenger compartment with a virtual image display because of the simplicity and flexibility of its design. The present invention is particularly useful as a head-up virtual image display for use in a vehicle that displays instrumentation information, and provides a vehicle head-up dynamic instrument display that provides for a virtual image instrument display at or ahead of the windshield of the vehicle. The present invention requires no mirrors and uses an optimized optical combiner surface for improved image clarity and brightness. The image display source location is ideal because there is generally ample room in the overhead area of the passenger compartment to mount equipment without interfering with an operator's field of view in any direction or his or her freedom of movement. The overhead mounted configuration requires minimal modification to the existing passenger compartment of any vehicle. The optical combiner may be roof, dashboard or windshield mounted whichever is most convenient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle having 
a windshield, a passenger compartment, a roof and a combiner 
which is disposed at an adjustable angle with respect to the 
display source and the operator of the vehicle. Such a head-up display system included in such a 
vehicle is known from US-A-4,831,366. In the known arrangement 
a projector unit is disposed at the ceiling of the vehicle to 
project display images and a combiner unit for reflecting the 
projected display images to the driver is disposed adjustable 
in its angular position and adjustable in its height, so that 
virtual display images can be appropriately seen by the driver 
ahead of the combiner unit along the driver's eye direction 
variable according to the vehicle speed. The known design is difficult to retrofit into existing 
vehicles without major dashboard modification, since it requires 
a height adjustment mechanism that must be fitted into the dashboard. Another state-of-the-art head-up display is described 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,973,139 which discloses a head-up display 
system that includes an image source for producing imaging 
illumination, optical apparatus for directing the illumination 
provided by the source to a windshield of a vehicle, and a 
combiner that comprises a portion of the windshield for partially 
reflecting the directed imaging illumination to produce a virtual 
image of the image source that is viewable by the operator of 
the vehicle.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a vehicle with an overhead mounted head-up display 
which can be easily fitted into existing vehicles without major 
modification of the dashboard and which allows to accommodate 
for operators having differing heights and that sit at different 
locations and which provides for the display of a virtual image 
at different locations in front of the windshield of the vehicle. This object is achieved using a vehicle mentioned 
at the outset in which the combiner of the head-up display system 
has a large adjustable spherical radius of curvature 
to provide for the display of a virtual image at 
different locations in front of the windshield of the vehicle. The image display source can be mounted off-axis or 
in-line with the viewer's or operator's forwarding viewing 
direction depending on the vehicle passenger compartment 
configuration. The display image source is used in conjunction 
with a spherical or an aspheric optical combiner to display 
sensor and communication data, for example, at an optimum

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle (11) having a windshield (12), a passenger 
compartment, a roof (11a), and a head-up display system (10), 

wherein the head-up display system (10) is adapted to project 
a virtual image (18) for viewing by an operator (17) of the 

vehicle (11), said system comprising: 

a display source (16, 16a) that is disposed in the 
passenger compartment adjacent the roof (11a) of the vehicle 

(11) and above the operator (17) of the vehicle (11); and 
a combiner (14) which is disposed at an adjustable 
angle with respect to the display source (16, 16a) and the 

operator (17) of the vehicle (11); 
 
characterized in that
 
   said combiner (14) has a large, adjustable spherical 

radius of curvature (15) 
to provide for the display of a 

virtual image (18) at different locations in front of the 
windshield of the vehicle (11). 
The vehicle of claim 1, characterized in that the 
display source (16) is disposed off-axis and at an angle relative 

to a forward viewing direction of the operator (17) defined 
by a line passing through the center of the seat (19) in the 

longitudinal direction of the vehicle (11).  
 
The vehicle of claim 1, characterized in that the 
display source (16a) is disposed in-line with respect to a 

forward viewing direction of the operator (17) defined by a
