<DESCRIPTION>
Many products include a substrate which is coated 
with a particulate substance, such as fibers or granules 
adhering to a surface of the substrate. For example, 
common forms of such fibers are often referred to as 
flock, whereas particles, in general, may be abrasive 
particles, such as are used in sandpaper. Because flock 
usually has the largest length-to-width ratio of commonly 
applied particulate materials and is usually made of 
flexible materials, with a typical length between about 
3/4 to 2 mm and a mass per unit length of between about 0.11 and 2.0 g/km 
(a denier of between about one and eighteen 
denier), it is usually the most difficult particulate 
substance to deposit at high density levels. 1 denier = 0.111 tex, and 1 tex = 1 g per kilometer. With regard to flocked products, for example, the 
highest density of fibers on commercially available 
products, generally do not exceed 135 g/m2 (about four ounces of 
flock per square yard). It is rarely possible to exceed 
about fifteen or so percent of the theoretical flock 
density possible for a given flock length and mass per unit length (denier), i.e. 
where maximum theoretical flock density on the surface 
exists when the substrate is essentially packed with 
straight fibers, each fiber touching adjacent fibers along 
its whole length. There are several problems associated with limited 
particulate density. For example, multiple applications 
of a weight or a frictional shuffling action, as on a 
flocked carpet, or on any of the commonly available carpet 
structures, often bends the fibers at the base where the 
fibers enter the adhesive layer or base structure, tending  
 
to break the fibers without actually abrading or wearing 
them away throughout their lengths. In contrast, the same weight or shuffling action on a 
high-density surface bends the fibers, but not at their 
bases, since the close proximity of adjacent fibers 
"support" each other, causing the weight or abrasive force 
to wear the top ends of the fibers, allowing the whole 
length of the fibers to wear, thus presenting a great deal 
of material to resist the abrading action. The ratio of 
the abrasion resistance of two flocked surfaces, one in 
which the fibers are systematically abraded along their 
whole length verses the cutting of fibers at the base and 
carried away, is many times the ratio of the flock 
density. Hence, even the highest density flocked 
substrates commonly available generally do not offer 
adequate abrasion resistant surfaces for use in many 
appli

<CLAIMS>
A method for increasing the density of a particulate 
substance adhering to a substrate, wherein the 

substrate is sufficiently resilient to distension to 
cause the substrate to thereafter relax and thereby 

cause a surface of the substrate to diminish, 
comprising the steps of: 


a) disposing the substrate on a support so as to be distensible; 
b) directing a material such as a liquid or a gas 
between the substrate and 

the support to thereby distend the substrate to 
a convex shape; 
c) disposing an adhesive onto the substrate surface; 
d) disposing a particulate substance onto the 
substate surface and adhering the particulate substance thereto; and 
e) discharging the material from between the 
substrate and the support, whereby the substrate 

relaxes, thereby diminishing the substrate 
surface area and consequently increasing the 

density of the particulate substance on the 
substrate surface. 
A method of Claim 1 further including the step of 
forming the substrate, wherein the substrate is 

formed by: 

a) at least partially immersing the support in a 
fluid substrate precursor, whereby the support 

is at least partially coated with the fluid 
substrate precursor; and  

 
b) exposing the support and the fluid substrate 
precursor coated onto the support to conditions 

sufficient to cause the fluid substrate 
precursor to form the substrate. 
A method of Claim 2 wherein the fluid substrate 
precursor includes a latex, and 

the conditions sufficient 
to cause the fluid substrate precursor to form the 

substrate e.g. include exposure of said fluid substrate 
precursor to a coagulant which causes the latex to 

substantially coagulate on the support. 
A method of any preceding Claim wherein adhesive is disposed 
on the substrate by at least partially immersing the 

substrate in a fluid adhesive, whereby at least a 
portion of the fluid adhesive adheres to the 

substrate surface. 
A method of Claim 4 further including the step of 
spinning the substrate and support while the 

substrate is at least partially immersed in the fluid 
adhesive, the axis of rotation of the substrate and 

the support being at an acute angle to the surface of 
the fluid adhesive bath, thereby forming a coat of 

the adhesive over at least a portion of the 
substrate. 
A method of Claim 8 wherein the particulate substance 
is a flock of fibers which, for example, 

is deposited on 
the adhesive by electrostatic deposition.  

 
A method of Claim 6 wherein the substrate has a 
shape which is substantially hemispherical. 
A method for increasing the density of a particulate 
substance adhering to a flat substrate, wherein the 

substrate is sufficiently resilient to distension to 
cause the substrate to thereafter relax and thereby 

cause the surface area of the substrate to diminish, 
comprising the steps of: 


a) supporting a first edge of the substrate with a 
first support; 
b) support a second edge of the substrate with a 
second support, wherein said second support is 

movable relative to the first support, and 
wherein said second support is extendable along 

the second edge of the substrate; 
c) disposing an adhesive onto the substrate; 
d) moving the second support relative to the first 
support, thereby distending at least a portion 

of the substrate; 
e) extending the second support to elongate the 
second edge of the substrate; 
f) disposing the particulate substance onto the 
adhesive disposed on the substrate whereby the 

particulate substance adheres to the substrate; 
and 
g) thereafter releasing the substrate allowing it to relax and its 
surface area to diminish, consequently 

increasing the density of the particulate 
substance on the substrate. 
A method of Claim 8 wherein moving the second 
support relative to the first support and expanding 

the second support forms a gradient of distension of 
the substrate, whereby the particulate substance on 

the adhesive, following relaxation of the substrate, 
has a continuous gradient of density which 

corresponds to the gradient of distension of the 
substrate during deposition of the particulate 

substance onto the adhesive. 
Apparatus for increasing the density of a particulate 
substance adhering to a resilient substrate, 

comprising: 

a) a support, defining a conduit extending 
therethrough; 
b) means for disposing the resilient substrate onto 
the support, whereby one end of the conduit is 

covered by the resilient substrate in a relaxed 
position; 
c) means for directing a fluid material through the 
conduit in between the resilient substrate and 

the support to cause the resilient substrate to 
move from the relaxed position to a distended 

position; 
d) means for adhering for particulate substance 
onto the resilient substrate when said 

resilient substrate is in the distended 
position; and 
e) means for releasing the fluid material from 
between the support and the resilient substrate, 

to allow the density of the particulate 
substance bound to the resilient substrate to 

increase during movement of the 
resilient substrate from the distended position 

to the relaxed position. 
Apparatus for increasing the density of a particulate 
substance adhering to a resilient flat substrate, 

comprising: 

a) a first supporting means for supporting a first 
edge of the substrate; 
b) a second supporting means for supporting a 
second edge of the substrate, wherein the second 

supporting means is movable from a first 
position to a second position relative to the 

first supporting means to thereby distend the 
substrate, and wherein the second supporting 

means is extendable along the second edge of the 
substrate, to thereby elongate the second edge 

of the substrate; and 
c) means for adhering the particulate substance 
onto the substrate while the substrate is in the 

elongated, distended position, whereby release 
of the substrate increases the density of the 

particulate substance adhering to the substrate. 
A system of Claim 11 wherein the first supporting 
means is extendable along the first edge of the 

substrate, to thereby elongate the first edge of said 
substrate.
