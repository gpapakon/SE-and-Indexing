<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a life-size imaging rod
lens array comprising a plurality of small-diameter rod lenses
arranged in one row. The invention also relates to a life-size
imaging optical apparatus which has the surface of a document and
a sensor provided on opposite sides of the rod lens array such that
the image on the surface of a document is read and transmitted to
the sensor. The technology of the invention is useful when applied
to the optics of facsimile and other optical machines.Optical machines such as facsimile, copiers, printers and
scanners employ various types of scanning apparatus in order to
convert the information on the surface of a document to readable
electrical signals. A common scanning apparatus is of a "contact"
type that comprises illumination optics, a rod lens array as
life-size imaging optics, a sensor, a cover glass (transparent
substrate) and other parts mounted in a frame. The document is
placed in contact with the surface of the cover glass and
illuminated with light from the illumination optics. The
illuminated image on the document passes through the rod lens array
to be focused on the sensor, where it is converted to an electrical 
signal. The rod lens array is life-size imaging optics in which
a plurality of rod lenses each having a refractive-index
distribution in the radial direction are arranged, typically in
one or two rows.The lens material of which the rod lens array is made is
either glass or plastics. Glass rod lenses with a refractive-index
distribution are manufactured by ion-exchange or thermal
interdiffusion or a like method. For example, the rod lenses in
a commercial glass rod lens array have a minimum outside diameter
of 0.6 mm.A single rod lens forms a life-size image in a range defined
by a circle with a radius of X0 (i.e., the view radius) and the
quantity of light which is maximal on the optical axis decrease
with the increasing radial distance. Therefore, the distribution
of the quantity of light along the length of the lens array
experiences unevenness at a period which is equal to the distance
between adjacent lenses. The magnitude of the unevenness is
determined by the degree of overlap m which is defined by m = X0/2R,
where 2R is the distance between the optical axes of adjacent rod
lenses.Fig. 1 shows how the unevenness in the quantity of light
varies as a function of the degree of overlap m in a one-row rod
lens array for a so-called "line scanning system" which utilizes
light in an extremely narrow range near to the overall
