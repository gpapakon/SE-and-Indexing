<ABSTRACT>
In a procedure for controlling braking in motor vehicles:   a) the wheel speed is sensed at at least one wheel of the front axle of the motor vehicle, b) the brake pressure in the brake cylinders at each axle of the motor vehicle is electrically controlled or regulated, c) the beginning and the progress of the braking operation are determined, d) a time window is defined between two instants chosen during the braking operation, e) one or more wheel-speed-dependent or slip-difference-dependent threshold values are specified, f) the variation with time of the wheel speed(s) or slip difference is recorded and evaluated by comparison with the threshold value(s), g) the evaluation is used to allocate the motor vehicles to different classes with different behaviour as regards dynamic changes in axle load, h) depending on this classification, the braking is regulated by specification of the brake pressure.

Method of regulating the braking process of motor vehicles, 
whereby 


a) at least one wheel of the front axle of the vehicle the 
wheel speed (n
V
) is sensed, 
b) at each axle of the vehicle the brake pressure (p) in 
the brake cylinders is electrically controlled or 

regulated, 
c) the instant (t
0
) of the commencement of braking and the 
timing (t
B
) of the braking process are determined and 
used to determine the time characteristic of the wheel 

speeds (n(t)), 
d) the time characteristic of the wheel speeds (n(t)) is 
evaluated by comparison with at least one preselected 

wheel speed-dependent threshold value (SW), 
 
characterized in that: 


e) a time window (t
F
) is defined between two instants (t
0
, 
t
6
) selected during the braking process, 
f) the braking processes of lorry-trailer combinations 
comprising a towing vehicle and a trailer/semi-trailer 

are regulated by evaluating the time characteristic of 
the wheel speeds (n(t)) of the towing vehicle during the 

time window (t
F
), 
g) in dependence upon the evaluation of the wheel speeds 
(n(t)) of the towing vehicle, the braking force 

distribution between towing vehicle and trailer/semi-trailer 
as well as the braking force deployment over 

time of towing vehicle and trailer/semi-trailer are 
preselected. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that, in 
dependence upon the evaluation of the wheel speeds (n(t)) of  

 
the towing vehicle, the lorry-trailer combinations are 

assigned to various classes presenting different behaviour in 
response to a variation in dynamic axle load. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that at 
least one wheel of the rear axle of the vehicle the wheel 

speed (n
H
) is sensed, that the slip difference (SD) is 
determined from the wheel speed (n
V
) of the front axle and the 
wheel speed (n
H
) of the rear axle, and that the time 
characteristic of the slip difference (SD(t)) is acquired and 

evaluated by comparison with at least one slip-dependent 
threshold value (SW). 
Method according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterized in 
th
at variations in dynamic axle load are evaluated as 
significant when the threshold values (SW) are exceeded 

during the time window (t
F
). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that, in the event of significant variations in dynamic axle 

load, the instant (t
2
) of attainment of the threshold values 
(SW) and the period (t
D
) of exceeding of the threshold values 
(SW) are determined and that, in dependence upon the 

evaluation of the two instants (t
2
, t
4
) determining the 
exceeding of the threshold values (SW), a control of the 

braking process is effected. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the time window (t
F
) is defined at the start of the 
braking process between the start of braking (t
0
) and the 
instant 0.6 s (t
6
). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that one of the threshold values (SW) is preselected as a 

variation of the wheel speed (n) or of the slip difference 
(SD) amounting to 3 to 4% of the rolling slip value 

determined prior to the start of the braking process. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7 for controlling the 
braking process of motor vehicles presenting large variations 

in dynamic axle load, in particular the braking process of  
 

motor vehicles with a high centre of gravity and a short 
wheel base.
