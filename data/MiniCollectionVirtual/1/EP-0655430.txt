<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to gassed emulsion explosives.Emulsion explosives usually consist of a water-in-oil emulsion, containing
oxidisers. Historically they were manufactured with the aid of emulsifiers
based on sugar esters. More recently the generic family of PIBSA (polyisobutylenesuccinicanhydride)
based emulsifiers found application in this
respect. PIBSA based emulsifiers result in more stable emulsions, which
can be made under a wide range of process parameters, and which
exhibit the required shelf life.AU-B-615597 discloses an emulsion explosive comprising an
emulsifier blend. The first emulsifier can be a condensation
product of a poly(alkenyl)succinic acid and/or anhydride with a
primary amine and the second emulsifier can be a phosphate esterIt is common practice in the field of emulsion explosives to manipulate
the density of the explosive by controlled gassing thereof. Gassing can
be accomplished by chemical or mechanical means.Chemical gassing can be based on a number of reactions, such as the
reaction of a metal with a strong acid to form hydrogen, but the most
commonly used reaction is the catalytic decomposition of sodium nitrite
in an acid medium to form nitrogen.PIBSA based emulsifiers are generally able to react with the acid required
for chemical gassing, usually with a deleterious effect on the 
emulsification properties of the emulsifier. The commonly used chemical
gassing reaction can thus not be used to gas the known PIBSA based
explosive emulsions.It is also known that porous ammonium nitrate prills (PPAN), which are
used in an admixture with fuel oil to form ammonium-nitrate-fuel-oil
explosives (ANFO), can be stabilised with naphthalene sulphonate
against the thermal degradation of the prill at 32Â°C. Such a sulphonate
is a surfactant which has an opposite emulsifying action to the
emulsifiers commonly used in emulsion explosive technology
as is known from US-A-5076867 and US-A-5034071.
The
customary admixture of ANFO, made from prills stabilised in this way,
with emulsion explosives to form a product commonly known in the
explosives art as "Heavy ANFO", results in the degradation of the
emulsion part of the admixture and the failure of the explosive due to the
incompatibility of the sulphonate and the emulsifier.It is an object of this invention to provide a PIBSA - based emulsion
explosive with which the aforesaid problems can be overcome or at least
minimised. According to the invention a PIBSA based emulsion explosive is provided
which includes a suitable ester of
