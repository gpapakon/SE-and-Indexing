<ABSTRACT>
An optical isolator comprising first through fourth 
plate-like birefringent substances, each for receiving and 

transmitting an incident beam of light. Each plate-like 
birefringent substance has a corresponding optical axis which 

is inclined with respect to a direction of the incident beam of 
light. The optical isolator also includes first and second 

magneto-optical materials (2) and (5), each for rotating a plane of 
polarization of the incident beam of light. The optical axis 

of the second plate-like birefringent substance (3) is rotated by 
one of -45° and 135° about a first axis which is perpendicular 

to a surface of the first plate-like birefringent substance (1). 
The optical axis of the third plate-like birefringent substance (4) 

is rotated by one of 45° and 225° about a second axis which is 
perpendicular to the surface of the first plate-like 

birefringent substance (1). The optical axis of the fourth plate-like 
birefringent substance (6) is rotated by one of -90⁰ and 90⁰ 

about a third axis which is perpendicular to the surface of the 
first plate-like birefringent substance (1). The first and third 

plate-like birefringent substance (1) and (4) 
having thicknesses which are 

equal. The second and fourth plate-like birefringent 
substances (3) and (6) each have a 

thickness which is (1 + √2) times as 
thick as the first plate-like birefringent substance (1). The 

second magneto-optical material (5) rotates the plane of 
polarization in a direction which is opposite to the direction 

of rotation of the first magneto-optical material. Finally,  
 

the optical isolator includes a magnetized element for 
magnetizing the first and second magneto-optical (2) materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polarization
independent optical isolators for shielding return beams which
are reflected by optical systems (i.e. optical fiber
communication systems utilizing semiconductor lasers or optical
fiber amplifiers).Semiconductor lasers, which are used as light sources
for performing input and output operations in optical fiber
communication systems and optical disks, suffer from unstable
oscillations when return beams are reflected by the optical
system. These return beams are caused by factors such as an
end surface of an optical fiber, connecting points between
optical fibers, coupling lenses, and optical connectors. The
unstable oscillation caused by return beams leads to
significant impairment of performance such as an increase in
noise and fluctuations in the output.Optical isolators of various types have been developed
so as to remove such instability in the operation of the
semiconductor lasers. One such type of optical isolator is the
polarization independent optical isolator. The polarization
independent optical isolator may utilize the 
separation/synthesis of the ordinary ray (hereinafter "O ray")
and the extraordinary ray (hereinafter "E ray") through the use
of plate-like birefringent crystals such as rutiles and
calcites. An advantage of the use of this type of polarization
independent optical isolator is that it exhibits isolation
effects upon all planes of polarization without being dependent
on the direction of polarization.For example, Examined Japanese Patent Publication No.
Sho. 60-49297 discloses an optical isolator in which a first
plate-like birefringent crystal, a magneto-optical material
(i.e. Faraday rotator), an optically active crystal, and a
second plate-like birefringent crystal are arranged in order
from an incident end. That optical isolator has a permanent
magnet for magnetizing the magneto-optical material.
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-46419 and
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-68515 each
disclose an optical isolator in which not only two or more
magneto-optical materials and three or more plate-like
birefringent crystals are arranged, but also a permanent magnet
for magnetizing the magneto-optical materials is provided.EP-A-489 315 and EP-A-252 509 disclose further examples of an
optical isolator. Each of these optical isolators comprises four
birefringent crystal plates and two Faraday rotators.In such conventional optical isolators, the direction
and angle of rotation of a plane of polarization by the
