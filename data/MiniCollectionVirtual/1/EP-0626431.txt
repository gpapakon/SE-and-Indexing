static-charge buildup must be strictly avoided, such as semiconductor wafer packages, electronic and electric members,

general coating techniques and readily cured by ultraviolet or visible light to give a coating film excellent in antistatic 

property, transparency, hardness and marring resistance. The composition comprises: (a) 100 parts by weight of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photo-setting
conductive coating composition which can be easily set by
ultraviolet or active irradiation to form a coating film
superior in conductivity, transparency, marring resistance
and hardness.Heretofore, materials having antistatic properties
have been used for storage vessels for semi-conductor
wafers, electronic/electric parts, floor/wall coverings for
a production factory of semi-conductors, etc., wherein
static electrification must be avoided.In order to impart antistatic properties to a molded
article of a synthetic resin, for example, there can be
normally used a method of coating a molded article with a
paint containing a carbon powder, metallic powder, etc., or
a method of molding a molded article using a synthetic
resin kneaded with a carbon powder, carbon fiber, metallic
fiber, etc.However, the above methods have a problem that a
transparent molded article can not be obtained due to the 
paint and coloring of the molded article itself, and the
content can not be seen through the molded article in case
of application for the window part.In order to solve the above problems, various trials
have been made. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 57-85866 discloses a transparent paint
comprising a conductive fine powder of tin oxide as a main
component and a binder.The above paint can forms a coating film which is
transparent and has antistatic properties, however, the
resulting coating film normally has low hardness because
the binder is a thermoplastic resin, thereby, a coating
film having excellent marring resistance and solvent
resistance can not be obtained.Further, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 60-60166
discloses a transparent paint comprising a conductive
fine powder of tin oxide as a main component and a photo-setting
resin binder.The coating film formed by using this paint is
superior in marring resistance and solvent resistance,
however, storage stability of the paint is liable to be
affected by a temperature, humidity, etc., which results in
deterioration of transparency with time. Further, the
paint has a problem about process, that is, sag is arisen
during coating by a normal bar coating method, doctor blade 
coating method, roll coating method and dipping method
because of it's low viscosity. There is also a problem
that productivity such as raw material efficiency is
inferior and nonuniformity is arisen on the surface of the
coating film during coating by a spraying method suitable
for a low viscosity paint.In
