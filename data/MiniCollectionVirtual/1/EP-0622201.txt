<ABSTRACT>
A thermal ink jet printhead cartridge priming apparatus 
that includes a plurality of caps (113) respectively 

associated with a plurality of printhead nozzle arrays for 
controllably sealing printhead nozzle arrays pursuant to 

engagement thereof against the printhead cartridge to 
surround the nozzle arrays, a plurality of vacuum conveying 

elements (115, 119) respectively associated with the caps 
for individually conveying priming vacuum to an associated 

cap, a manually actuated selector assembly (20) for 
connecting a selected one of the vacuum conveying elements 

to a source of priming vacuum, and a source of priming 
vacuum (251, 253) spaced apart from the manually actuated 

selection means for selectively engaging the selector 
assembly for application of vacuum thereto. By separating 

the vacuum source from the selector, positive pressure is 
not applied to the nozzle arrays when the caps are brought 

into engagement with the printhead cartridges since venting 
is provided by the unobstructed vacuum conveying elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention generally relates to ink-jet 
printer technology, and is directed more particularly to 
apparatus for priming a thermal ink jet printhead cartridge 
without removal of the printhead cartridge from the printer 
carriage. Thermal ink jet printers commonly utilize printhead 
cartridges, often called pens, which typically include one 
or more ink reservoirs and an integrated circuit printhead 
that includes a nozzle plate having an array of ink ejecting 
nozzles which emit ink droplets in response to electrical 
pulses provided to the printhead. An important consideration with thermal ink jet 
printhead cartridges is the need to ready a printhead for 
printing. For example, when a new printhead cartridge is 
installed in a printer or after a period of non-usage, the 
cartridge might be unable to produce ink drops at one or 
more nozzles, for example as a result of foreign contamination 
of the nozzles, dried ink in the nozzles, or air 
ingested into the nozzles. Known systems for priming include those which 
involve the application of pressure to the ink supply in 
order to cause ink flow into the ink containing chambers 
that are adjacent the ink ejecting nozzles. Considerations  
 
with such known systems is need for access to the ink 
reservoir, and the various mechanical impedances between 
the ink reservoir and the nozzles which reduce the pressure 
that eventually reaches the nozzles. Another known system requires that a printhead cartridge 
be removed from the printer carriage and inserted 
into a separate priming station for priming, which further 
requires that the printhead cartridge be removed from the 
priming station after priming and inserted back into the 
carriage. Considerations with these systems include the 
additional wear and tear on the electrical contacts of the 
printhead cartridge and the printer carriage, as well as 
the inconvenience of having to perform the remove and 
insert procedure two times for one priming. A further known system includes a movable cap that is 
engageable with a printhead nozzle array and is directly 
connected to a tube of a peristaltic pump. Considerations 
with this system, however, include the need for separate 
pump for each printhead of a multiple printhead carriage, 
and clogging of the pump tube with ink. It would therefore be an advantage to provide an 
improved ink jet printhead cartridge primer which provides 
for priming of a printhead cartridge nozzle array without 
removal of the printhead cartridge from the printer,

<CLAIMS>
Primer apparatus for priming one of a plurality of 

printhead cartridges (C1, C2, C3, C4) supported by a print 
carriage (51) that is movable along a carriage scan axis, 

wherein each printhead cartridge includes a nozzle array 
comprised of ink ejecting nozzles, and wherein the nozzle 

arrays of the cartridges are arranged in a predetermined 
arrangement, comprising: 


a plurality of caps (113) respectively associated 
with the printhead nozzle arrays for controllably sealing 

said printhead nozzle arrays pursuant to engagement thereof 
against the printhead cartridge to surround the nozzle 

arrays; 
a plurality of vacuum conveying means (115, 119) 
respectively associated with said capping means for 

individually conveying priming vacuum to an associated 
capping means; 
a source of priming vacuum (251, 253) for 
application of vacuum thereto, characterised by manually 

actuated selection means (20) spaced apart from the source 
of priming vacuum for connecting a selected one of said 

vacuum conveying means to the latter. 
Primer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
plurality of caps (113) are supported by a movable sled 

(111). 
The primer apparatus of claim 1 or 2, wherein each of 
said plurality of vacuum conveying means includes: 


a chamber (115) for supporting a respective capping 
means at a capping means opening; 
filtering means (129) contained within said chamber 
for trapping ink; and 
a flexible tube (119) connected between said 
chamber and said manually actuated selection means. 
The primer apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
selection means includes: 


a slider (123) for receiving each of the flexible 
tubes connected to the chambers of the vacuum conveying 

means, said slider includes a plurality of bores (127) in 
respective communication with said flexible tubes; and 
lever means (139) for controlling the position of 
said slider such that vacuum from said vacuum source is 

applied to a selected one of said bores. 
The primer apparatus of claim 4, further including 
detent means (165, 167) for controlling the position of said 

slider.
