<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for mixing compositions of matter into a 
homogeneous mixture and detecting on-line the homogeneity and potency of the 
mixture, and a method for using the same. More particularly, this invention relates to 
an apparatus for mixing the components of a pharmaceutical composition into a 
homogeneous mixture and detecting on-line the homogeneity and potency of said 
pharmaceutical composition. The mixing of pharmaceutical compositions is a crucial step in processing an 
active drug into a form for administration to a recipient. Pharmaceutical compositions 
usually consist of five (5) or more separate components, including the active drug, 
which must be mixed into a homogeneous mixture. It is critical to determine the 
concentration of the active drug in a pharmaceutical mixture. It is also advantageous 
to determine the concentration of the other non-active components within the final 
homogeneous mixture. The assurance that the pharmaceutical composition is 
homogeneous is necessary in order to ensure the appropriate dosage of the active 
drug is delivered to a recipient. The concentration of the non-active components in a pharmaceutical mixture is 
also important because it determines the physical properties of the mixture. For 
example, the non-active components of pharmaceutical compositions are known as 
excipients. An example of an excipient is a disintegrant. Disintegrants determine the 
rate of dissolution of a tablet in a recipient's stomach. Therefore, if the disintegrant is 
not homogeneously distributed in the pharmaceutical mixture, then the resulting tablets 
may not dissolve at a uniform rate. This could give rise to quality, dosing and 
bioavailability problems. Typically, homogeneity of a pharmaceutical composition referred to the 
distribution of the active drug in the pharmaceutical composition. Potency of a 
pharmaceutical composition referred to the amount of the active component in a 
pharmaceutical composition. Traditionally, the determination of the potency and 
homogeneity of a pharmaceutical mixture has been time consuming. In addition, 
traditional methods measure the potency and homogeneity of only the active  
 
component in a pharmaceutical composition and gives no information concerning the 
homogeneity of the non-active components. The traditional methods typically involve using a conventional blender such as 
a core blender, a ribbon blender, a "V"-blender or the like, to mix the components of 
a pharmaceutical composition. When the
