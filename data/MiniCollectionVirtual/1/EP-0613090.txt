<ABSTRACT>
In advance preparation of a channel program by one of the processor units (PROC) of a data processing system, the addresses for the channel command words (CCW), the data tables for indirect addressing (CCW-AD, IDAW-AD), and the data transfer addresses (DAT-AD) which are included in the working memory (MM) in the prepared channel program to be stored, are checked by a check which is integrated in the run of the preparation program, immediately before they are supplied, to establish whether the data which is identified by the real memory addresses is present in the physical working memory (MM), which can be configured in various ways. For this purpose, a part (AORS) of the microprogram memory (CM) contains entries which are assigned to the physical addresses of the individual 4k byte pages or groups of them, can be addressed using a base address (AOR-BAD) and a distance (X ...) which is derived from address bits of the address to be checked (CCW-AD, IDAW-AD, DAT-AD), and are selected by jump instructions (JIND) which are inserted at corresponding points of the preparation program. If, according to the entry (RETURN), the address is admissible, the preparation program is continued. In the other case (GOTO ERROR), an error routine (ERROR) is entered.
