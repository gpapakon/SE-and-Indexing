<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carboxylic acid 
derivatives. More specifically, the present invention relates to 
carboxylic acid derivatives having retinoic acid type 
Pharmacological activities. Retinoic acid (Vitamin A acid) is considered to be an 
active metabolite of Vitamin A. This compound has extremely 
important pharmacological activity for the maintenance of life. 
For instance, it induces differentiation on embryonic immature cells 
by which mature cells having characterized functions are produced. 
It also accelerates the proliferation of cells. From a clinical 
standpoint, retinoic acid is found to be useful for the treatment of 
avitaminosis of Vitamin A, epithelial hyperkeratosis, leukemia, and 
certain types of cancer. Various derivatives of Vitamin A prepared 
to date, much as the benzoic acid derivatives disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 61-22047 and 61-76440, are found 
to have such pharmcological activities. These compounds, including 
retinoic acid, which exhibit retinoic acid-type pharmacological 
activities are referred to as retinoids. However, all of the 
presently known retinoids are benzoic acid-type derivatives like 
those disclosed in the aforementioned publications, and no pyridine  
 
carboxylic acid-type retinoid is known to date. The inventor of the present invention has conducted 
research toward the development of useful retinoids, and as a 
result, found that carboxylic acid derivatives represented by the 
following formula: 
have extremely high retinoic acid-type pharmacological activities. 
The present invention was achieved on the basis of these findings. The present invention thus provides a carboxylic acid 
derivative having the above-described formula wherein R¹, R², and R³ 
independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group with the 
exception that all of R¹, R², and R³ do not simultaneously represent 
hydrogen atoms and R¹ together with R² optionally represent a 
cyclic structure formed by the combination thereof; R⁴ represents a 
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group; X represents a nitrogen atom or C-OH; 
and A represents -CO-NH- or -NH-CO-. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition 
comprising an effective amount of at least one of the above-described  
 
carboxylic acid derivatives or their pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts together with a pharmaceutically acceptable 
carrier or coating. In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present 
invention,
