<ABSTRACT>
The improvements consist in fixing the polar nucleus (1) of each coil 
to the chassis (2) of the brake through its polar plate (4), being this 

placed in the corresponding hole of the chassis, and being the 
thickness of the polar plate (4) greater 

than the thickness of the chassis 
(2). That and the feature of being fixed to the chassis by means of 

electric weld (6) allows the polar nucleus to be totally independent 
from the chassis (2) presenting itself in all of its length for 

the placement of the appropriate electromagnetic coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to improvements 
introduce to electric brakes for vehicles, like the 
electric brakes used on trucks, improvements desing for a 
better use of the polar nucleus, thus a better brake 
functioning. Traditionally the electric brake of a vehicle 
was been placed on the transmission shaft of it, 
fractioning the transmission in order to establish a 
support chassis for a bearing on the electric brake, that 
is provided with an axial and cylindrical section from 
which a radial wall surfaces until medium level. This wall 
is provided with holes from which the polar nucleus go 
through over which the coils are placed. These coils are 
grap hold, axially and from the outside by the appropriate 
polar plates that enframe the mentioned nucleus. Therefore, the mentioned chassis, to what is 
concern to it's support of the polar nucleus, form a plate 
that is crossed by the mentioned polar nucleus, in such a 
way that these polar nucleus adopt a symmetrical 
disposition with respect to the mentioned plate, to which 
the polar nucleus are fixed by electric welding or any 
other method. On a typical electric brake, there are 16 
coils, 8 for each side of the mentioned plate or chassis. Another known solution is to place the electric 
brake on the exit of the gear box, so the number of coils 
used is exactly half of the needed with the other 
disposition. At the same time, the polar nucleus in this  
 
new disposition are not place at the medium level of the 
chassis but through one of its sides. Of the two solutions metioned above, the second 
one clearly presents an extrordinary reduction of the 
number of coils used, but both of them present the problem 
that an important part of both polar nucleus are used to 
attach them to the chassis and therefore, such nucleus 
becomes partially unprofitable to what refers to the 
placement of the coil over it. The improvements that the invention presents are 
applicable to electric brakes for vehicles of the second 
mentioned type. Therefore for the ones where that the 
electric brake is mounted at the exit of the gear box, on 
which the polar nucleus are fix to one of it's sides and 
on which only half of coils are needed. On a more simple form, the improvements of the 
invention focus on the fact that the fixation of the polar 
nucleus to the chassis is not done directly as is usual, 
but through the corresponding polar plate, so that the 
polar nucleus could be totally used for the implatation of 
the correspoondig coil. Obviously, in order to

Improvements on electric brakes for 
vehicles, specially of electric brakes on which the carrier 

chassis of the polar nucleus for the corresponding coils 
recieves such nucleus by one of its sides, characterized 

in that the polar nucleus (1) is used totally in its length 
for the placement of a coil (9), doing it by the 

integration of the polar plate (4) of each polar nucleus 
(1) to the chassis (2), so the polar plate (4) is place on 

the hole (5) of the chassis (2), fixing it by electric weld 
or by any other appropriate way and being the thickness of 

the polar plate (4) greater than the thickness of the 
chassis (2), with the purpose of fixing it to the chassis 

by electric weld (6), or other appropriate method, and so 
the polar nucleus (1) results totally independent from the 

chassis (2).
