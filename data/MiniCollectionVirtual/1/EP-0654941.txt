<ABSTRACT>
A motion detection circuit and method using spatial 
information obtains the correlation information in various 

directions on a field which is advantageous for motion 
detection performance, and compares the obtained 

correlation information with a value corresponding to a 
previous frame, thereby effectively using a frame memory 

to accurately detect the motion. The motion detection 
circuit uses a number of line memories and delays, thereby 

delaying an input signal and making the delayed signal 
into a form of samples necessary for extracting spatial 

correlation information, and obtaining a subtraction value 
of the sample signals, comparing the subtraction value 

with a reference value, and extracting spatial correlation 
information of a number of bits. Also, the motion 

detection circuit uses a comparator, thereby comparing 
proper bit spatial correlation information with a value 

corresponding to a previous frame stored in a frame memory 
and determining whether the input signal is in a motion 

domain or a still domain. Accordingly, degradation of a 
picture quality can be removed, and an amount of hardware 

can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technology of
motion detection when processing a video signal, and more
particularly to a motion detection circuit and method
using spatial information, in which the number of bits of
a video signal is not limited as only one bit and spatial
information of various directions is obtained as
necessary, thereby accurately detecting motion as well as
effectively using a frame memory.Generally, in a video signal processor equipment such
as a high definition television, a video tape recorder and
a camera, detection of motion is used for encoding a video
signal. To compress motion image data, an adjacent
interframe difference signal is encoded. To improve a
quality of a picture, the picture is divided into blocks
each of which has a predetermined magnitude, adjacent
interframe motion is found, the picture is shifted by a
moved distance and an interframe difference signal is made
small. Here, finding the interframe motion by blocks is
called a motion estimation and a moved distance is called
a motion vector. Also, it is called a motion compensation
that a block of a currently processed frame is compensated
using a block of preceding frame corresponding to the
currently processed frame block.A conventional and basic motion detection circuit
uses a frame memory to obtain an interframe difference
signal and/or between two frames, determines whether the
video signal is in a motion domain or a still domain by
comparing the difference signal with a preset reference
value. Such a motion detection circuit requires a frame
memory, thereby causing an increase of costs. Thus, such 
an existing motion detection circuit has not been used in
a normal video equipment except for an improved definition
TV or an enhanced definition TV. Most video equipment
processes a video signal in a horizontal vertical two
dimensional domain. However, a still domain processing is
advantageous for processing a signal using a frame memory,
while a motion domain processing is advantageous for
processing a signal in a spatial domain. Thus, it is not
efficient to process a signal in only a spatial domain.
To effectively solve such a problem, it is necessary to
simplify hardware of the motion detection circuit and to
lower the costs therefor.Figure 1 is a circuit diagram for a conventional one
bit motion detection circuit. As shown in Figure 1 the
conventional motion detection circuit includes a bit
limiter 1 which compares an input 8-bit video signal Yin
with a predetermined value and converts the input video
sign
