<ABSTRACT>
Aromatic structures can be introduced into the molecular structure of polyalpha-olefin (PAO) lubricant oligomers by subjecting the polyalpha-olefin to a dehydrocyclization reaction which converts a portion of the pendant or branching alkyl groups in the recurring polymeric unit of PAO to aromatic structures. When the starting material for dehydrocyclization is PAO prepared by oligomerization of C6-C20 alpha-olefins in contact with reduced chromium oxide catalyst on porous support the dehydrocyclization reaction produces a lubricant oligomer with increased aromaticity without significantly degrading the viscometric properties of the feedstock lubricant, particularly the high VI of the starting material. The aromatic structures introduced lend increased thermal stability, wear resistance and solubilizing characteristics to the liquid lubricant oligomers so modified. The polyalpha-olefins produced by the dehydrocyclization process comprise novel compositions of matter containing up to five weight percent of aromatic structure attached as pendant groups to the backbone of the polyalpha-olefin structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEHYDROCYCLIZATION OF POLYALPHA-OLEFIN LUBRICANTSThis invention relates to novel compositions of polyalpha-olefin (PAO) oligomers containing aromatic structures useful as lubricant basestock and lubricant additives and to their means of preparation. More particularly, the invention relates to novel lubricant compositions having high viscosity index (VI) and enhanced thermal stability prepared by dehydrocyclization of polyalpha-olefin oligomers that exhibit high VI and low pour point.The synthesis of oligomeric hydrocarbon fluids, which have improved performance over those of mineral oil based lubricants, has been the subject of important research and development in the petroleum industry for many years and has led to the relatively recent market introduction of a number of superior polyalpha-olefin synthetic lubricants, primarily based on the oligomeri- zation of alpha-olefins or 1-alkenes. The thrust of the industrial research effort on synthetic lubricants has been toward fluids exhibiting useful viscosities over a wide range of temperature, i.e., improved viscosity index, while also showing lubricity, thermal and oxidative stability and pour point egual to or better than mineral oil. These new synthetic lubricants lower friction and hence increase mechanical efficiency over a wider range of operating conditions than mineral oil lubricants.Notwithstanding their generally superior properties, PAO lubricants are often formulated with additives, or an additive package, to enhance those properties for specific applications. The more commonly used additives include oxidation inhibitors, rust inhibitors, metal passivators, antiwear agents, extreme pressure additives, pour point depressants, detergent- dispersants, viscosity index (VI) improvers, foam 

 inhibitors and the like. This aspect of the lubricant arts is specifically described in Kirk-Othmer "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", 3rd edition, Vol. 14, pp. 477-526. Lube additive packages are complex and costly materials. Therefore, a significantly superior new lubricant is one in which the properties conferred on lube mixture by known additives are intrinsic to the structure of the new lubricant molecule, obviating or at least reducing the need for additives. Consequently, improvements in lubricant technology pursued by artisans in the field flow from both new additive development addressed to deficiencies in lubricant oligomers and new oligomer development for inherently better properties to displace additives.
