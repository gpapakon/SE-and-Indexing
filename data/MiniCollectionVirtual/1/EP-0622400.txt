<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
removal of isocyanate from air streams and is 
particularly applicable to the removal of unreacted 
toluene diisocyanate from the production of polyurethane 
foam. Polyurethane foam is used in many applications 
including, for example, insulation, furnishings, 
construction, surface coatings, sport and medical care. 
Initially, polyurethane foams were manufactured in a 
"two-step" process. In this process, toluene 
diisocyanate was first reacted with polyether polyol or 
polyester resin to form a polyurethane prepolymer, which 
was in turn reacted with water to produce polyurethane 
foams. At present, however, the typical production of 
flexible polyether and polyester urethane foams is a 
"one-step" process. In this process, toluene 
diisocyanate is reacted with polyether polyol or 
polyester resin, water and auxiliary chemicals, such as 
catalysts, emulsifiers, and additives, in a common mixing 
chamber and is poured onto a moving conveyor which has 
been lined with a film such as paper or plastic. The 
blend of the reactants undergoes a polymerization 
reaction which forms polyurethane foam. After the 
urethane foam has sufficiently formed, the film is 
removed, the foam is cut to the desired length and then 
stored for final cure. Toluene diisocyanate is generally a mixture of two 
isomers - 2,4-toluene diisocyanate and 2,6-toluene 
diisocyante - which are most commonly available in 80/20 
(2,4 isomer to 2,6 isomer) or 65/35 mixtures. Toluene 
diisocyanate is typically introduced into the reaction in 
an amount in excess of the stoichiometric quantity  
 
required for a complete reaction with the polyether 
polyol or polyester resin because some of the toluene 
diisocyanate is vaporized during the reaction. The major 
portion of excess diisocyanate is consumed in additional 
cross-linking reactions in the later stages of 
polymerization or cure. Toluene diisocyanate emissions 
due to vaporization typically occur throughout the 
production process, including during the pouring stage, 
at the film separation stage, and at the cutting stage. 
Post-production fabrication processes involving heat, 
such as thermoforming, hot wire cutting flame laminating 
and heat embossing, also cause toluene diisocyanate 
emissions as the toluene diisocyanate present in the 
polyurethane foam is liberated by heat degradation of the 
foam. Unfortunately, toluene diisocyanate poses serious 
health and environmental risks. Because of its toxicity, 
extreme care must be taken
