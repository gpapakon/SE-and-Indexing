<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with thickeners for aqueous 
systems and eliminates the need for organic cosolvents. More 
particularly, the invention relates to use of a β-cyclodextrin to 
reversibly supress the viscosity of an aqueous system containing a 
hydrophobically modified thickener. The invention also relates to a 
method for reversibly suppressing the aqueous system. Aqueous systems, such as for example coatings containing 
emulsion polymer binders, typically employ thickeners to obtain 
the desired degree of viscosity needed for the proper formulation 
and application of the aqueous system. One general type of 
thickener used in aqueous systems is referred to in the art by the 
term "associative." Associative thickeners are so called because the 
mechanism by which they thicken is believed to involve 
hydrophobic associations between the hydrophobic moieties on the 
thickener molecules themselves and/or with other hydrophobic 
surfaces. A number of different types of associative thickeners are 
known including, but not limited to hydrophobically-modified 
polyurethanes, hydrophobically-modified alkali soluble emulsions, 
hydrophobically-modified hydroxyethyl cellulose or other 
hydrophobically-modified natural products, and hydrophobically 
modified polyacrylamides. Certain of these associative thickeners, such as for example 
the hydrophobically-modified polyurethane thickeners, are sold as 
aqueous solutions containing organic cosolvents. The function of 
the organic cosolvent, such as for example propylene glycol and 
butyl carbital, is to suppress the viscosity of the aqueous solution  
 
containing the associative thickener to allow for ease in its handling 
before its use as a thickener. While these organic cosolvents 
perform their intended function, they possess potential 
environmental, safety and health disadvantages. Viscosity 
suppression may also be accomplished by the use of surfactants. 
While this presents no specific health/environmental hazard, it 
does degrade paint performance. US-A-5,137,571 discloses a method for reversibly complexing 
a cyclodextrin compound with the hydrophobic moieties on a 
hydrophobically modified thickener to suppress the viscosity of the 
aqueous solution containing the thickener so that such solutions 
can be easily handled, and then decomplexing the cyclodextrin 
compound from the thickener to permit the thickener to perform 
its intended function. The patent discloses that α,β-cyclodextrin, 
and γ-cyclodextrins can be used effectively to suppress

<CLAIMS>
Use of methyl-β-cyclodextrin as a β-cyclodextrin having 
hydrophobic groups for reversibly suppressing the viscosity of an 

aqueous system containing a hydrophobically-modified thickener. 
Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the aqueous system is a 
paint. 
A method for reversibly suppressing the viscosity of an 
aqueous solution containing a hydrophobically-modified thickener, 

the method comprising the steps of: 

i) complexing the hydrophobic moieties on the thickener 
with a pre-determined amount of a β-cyclodextrin 

having hydrophobic groups; 
ii) adding the complexed thickener and β-cyclodextrin to 

an aqueous system which is to be thickened; and 
iii) decomplexing or desorbing the β-cyclodextrin from the 
thickener; characterized in that the β-cyclodextrin is 

methyl-β-cyclodextrin.

polyethoxylated urethanes, hydrophobically modified alkali soluble 
emulsions, hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose and  

 
hydrophobically modified polyacrylamides. 
The method of claims 3 or 4, wherein the methyl-β-cyclodextrin 
is decomplexed or desorbed from the thickener by 

addition of a pre-determined amount of an anionic, nonionic or 
cationic surfactant. 
The method of claim 5, wherein the surfactant is added to the 
aqueous system at a concentration of one mole per mole of methyl-β-cyclodextrin. 
The method as claimed in claims 3, 4, 5 or 6, wherein the 
aqueous system is a paint.
