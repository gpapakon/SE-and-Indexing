 DEGRADABLE MULTILAYERED STRUCTURES5 Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of pending UnitedStates Patent Application Serial No. 07/806,769, filed"*■ December 12, 1991, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. . 10Field of the Invention This invention relates to a novel polymeric blend having enhanced environmental degradability properties comprising a non- biodegradable thermoplastic polymer. This invention also relates 15 to multilayered structures of non-biodegradable thermoplastic polymers that are environmentally degradable, to degradable radiation-resistant compositions and articles, and to methods of forming and using such structures, compositions and articles.20 Background of the InventionThere are numerous patents dealing with enhancing the degradability of conventional non-biodegradable polymers such as polyolefins by use of additive systems. These additive systems are quite frequently designed to enhance the polymers25 degradability in a specific type of environment and over a specific length of time. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,840,512 (Brackman) exemplifies prodegradant systems comprising ferric stearate with various free fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated. Manganese stearate is also exemplified in a system30 with stearic acid. Brackman states that thermoplastic films (e.g., polyolefin films) formed with these prodegradant systems will embrittle when exposed to artificially UV-activated irradiation at times ranging from 2 to 35 days. It is specifically stated that the nature of the hydrocarbon group on35 the fatty acid does not have a large influence on the rate of UV degradation. Brackman does not address the issue of degradability in other environments, such as in a compost environment. A patent dealing with a similar prodegradant system, U.S. Patent No. 4,067,836 (Potts et al.), discloses40 adding a transition metal salt, an auto-oxidative susceptible additive, and an anti-oxidant to polyethylene. The only* exemplified auto-oxidative susceptible additives were polypropylene and polyethylene oxide (which did not work as acceptably as polypropylene). The degradation of the samples was45 tested by exposure to an artificial solar light spectral 

 distribution. The degradability characteristics of these prodegradant additives were never demonstrated in other environments such as a compost environment. Generally, additive systems as described above, designed to make a polymer degrade when exposed to environmental
