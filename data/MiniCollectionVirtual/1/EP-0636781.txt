<ABSTRACT>
The plastics housing (2) for guiding the cold fluid stream has a moulded guide rib (9). This guides a part of the fluid stream over a section (10) of the valve closing member (4) which is spaced from the plastics housing. The valve closing member comprises a tube (5) guiding the hot fluid stream (3) and a valve plate (6) fitted on the tube end. The section of the valve closing member biased by the cold fluid stream is a wall section (10) of the tube. An operating device (14) for the valve shaft (6a) which supports the valve plate is mounted on the outside of the plastics housing.

A mixing valve for adding a hot fluid stream to a cold fluid stream, especially 
an exhaust-gas circulating valve in an internal combustion engine, 

comprising a casing (2) for conveying the cold fluid stream (1) and a valve 
closure member (4) supplying and guiding the hot fluid stream (3), which 

comprises a pipe (5) conveying the hot fluid stream (3) and extending 
through the casing (2), which is mounted in the casing (2), and a valve disc 

(6) for mounting on the end of the pipe,
 
characterised in that the casing (2), which is made of plastics material, has 

a guide rib (9) which conveys a part of the cold fluid stream (1) over at least 
one portion of the valve closure member (4) remote from the plastics 

material casing (2). 
A mixing valve according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the valve closure member portion acted upon by the 

cold fluid stream (1) via the guide rib (9) is a wall portion (10) of the pipe 
(5). 
A mixing valve according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the tubular plastics material casing (2) has a branch 

flange (8) extending substantially at right angles to the direction of flow of 
the cold fluid stream (1) and in which the pipe (5) conveying the hot fluid 

stream (3) extends along a wall portion (10) at a distance from the plastics 
material casing (2). 
A mixing valve according to any of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the valve closure member (4), especially the pipe (5), 

projects into the flow cross-section of the cold fluid stream (1) and extends 
in a recess (12) through the guide rib (9), which is substantially L-shaped 

and integrally moulded on the inner wall of the plastics material casing (2).  
 
A mixing valve according to claim 3 or claim 4,
 
characterised in that the end portion, outside the plastics material casing (2), 

of the pipe (5) conveying the hot fluid stream (3) is secured via a bearing 
flange (7) to a shoulder (8') on the branch flange (8). 
A mixing valve according to any of claims 3 to 5,
 
characterised in that a valve stem (6a) bearing the valve disc (6) extends 

through the side of the plastics material casing opposite to the branch flange 
(8), and a device (14) for actuating the valve stem (6a) is mounted on the 

outside of the plastics material casing. 
A mixing valve according to claim 5 or claim 6,
 
characterised in that the actuating device (14) and/or the bearing flange (7) 

is secured to the plastics material casing (2) by a jointed-flange or clip 
connection. 
A mixing valve according to any of claims 5 to 7,
 
characterised in that the bearing flange (7), which is made of light metal, 

has a holder (18) for a fluid line (17) connected to the pipe (5) conveying the 
hot fluid stream (3).
