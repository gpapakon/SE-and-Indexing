<ABSTRACT>
A variety of specific esters and mixtures of esters of polyhydric alcohols, particularly pentaerythritol, that are especially valuable lubricants for chlorine-free fluorocarbon refrigerant heat transfer fluids, particularly Refrigerant 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyol ester lubricant,
refrigerant working fluids including said lubricant
along with primary heat transfer fluids, and methods for
using these materials. The lubricant and lubricant base
stock is particularly suitable for use with
chlorine-free, fluoro-group-containing organic
refrigerating heat transfer fluids such as tetrafluoro-ethanes.Chlorine-free heat transfer fluids are desirable for
use in refrigerant systems, because their escape into the
atmosphere causes less damage to the environment than the
currently most commonly used chlorofluorocarbon heat
transfer fluids such as trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane.
The widespread commercial use of
chlorine-free refrigerant heat transfer fluids has been
hindered, however, by the lack of commercially adequate
lubricants. This is particularly true for one of the most
desirable working fluids, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, commonly
known in the art as "Refrigerant 134a". Other
fluoro-substituted ethanes are also desirable working fluids.U. S. -A- 5,021,179 of June 4, 1991 to Zehler et
al. (the same applicants as for this invention) discloses
and claims many general classes and specific types of polyol
esters suitable for refrigerant lubricants, including
some but not all of the specific teachings below.The following patents and published patent applications
also teach many general classes and specific examples 
of polyol esters useful as refrigerant lubricants
with chlorine-free fluoro group containing heat transfer
fluids, but are not believed to teach any of the specific
esters or mixtures of esters in the appended claims herein:U. S. -A- 5,096,606 of March 17, 1992 to Hagihara
et al., WO-A-90/12849, EP-A-0 406 479, EP-A-0 430 657,
EP-A-0 435 253, EP-A-0 445 610 and 0 445 611,
GB-A-2 216 541, EP-A-0 415 778, EP-A-0 449 406,
EP-A-0 458 584.The present invention relates to a polyol ester lubricant
resulting from reaction between an alcohol component
consisting of more than 98% by weight of pentaerythritol
with an acid component consisting of 7% by weight of adipic
acid, 33% by weight of 2-methyl butanoic acid, and 60% by
weight of pentanoic acid.Furthermore, the present invention relates to a refrigerant
working fluid consisting essentially of:
(A) a chlorine-free fluoro-group-containing heat transfer
fluid; and(B) a polyol ester lubricant resulting from reaction
between an alcohol component consisting of more than
98% by weight of pentaerythritol with an acid 
component consisting of 7% by weight of adipic acid,
