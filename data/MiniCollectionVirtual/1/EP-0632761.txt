<ABSTRACT>
In a process for manufacturing a three-dimensional object, the object is manufactured layer after layer. Each layer made of an electromagnetic radiation-hardenable material is applied, then radiation-hardened at spots corresponding to the object. Because of long heating and cooling times in the device used for manufacturing such objects, this manufacturing process is strongly delayed. In order to solve this problem, an area of the material which surrounds the object in each layer is irradiated, thus hardened, forming a containment wall (26) for the material (21).

Process for manufacturing a three-dimensional 
object, in which the object (3) is produced layer-by-layer 

by respectively applying a layer of material (21) 
which can be made to set by irradiating with electromagnetic 

radiation and subsequently making it set at the 
appropriate locations for the object (3) by irradiating 

it, a container wall (26) for the material being produced 
in each layer by irradiating a region of the material 

enclosing the object (3) and thereby making it set, 
characterized in that a material layer of defined 

thickness is introduced into a cutout (2) in a workbench 
(1) and in that the container wall (6) is produced by 

irradiating the material region adjacent to the inner 
wall of the cutout (2), so that the material layer is 

enclosed by the container wall (26). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a powdered solid material is used as the material 

(21) and the irradiation is carried out in such a way 
that the solid material sinters together at the 

irradiated locations. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that an appropriate annular region is made to set in 

each layer, so that a cylindrical container wall (26) is 
produced. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the material layer is applied to an 

underlying support (9) which, in its highest position, is 
arranged at least partially within the cutout (2) and, 

for forming each layer, is lowered downwards by an amount 
corresponding to the thickness of this layer.  

 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, before and after producing the 

container wall (26) and the object (3), a material layer 
is made to set over the entire area enclosed by the 

region of the container wall, so that a closed base (25) 
or a closed cover (27) is produced for the container 

(28). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, after completion, the container 

wall (26) with the object (3) enclosed by it is 
introduced into a removal container (15) and is cooled 

there under controlled conditions. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the object (3) is produced in an 

inert gas atmosphere. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a controlled laser beam (7) is used 

for the irradiation. 
Device for carrying out the process according to 
Claim 1, having a height-adjustable underlying support 

(9), a device (20) for applying to the underlying support 
(9) a layer of a material (21) which can be made to set 

by exposure to electromagnetic radiation, an irradiating 
means (4) and a control system (8, 24) for the irradiating 

means (4) for irradiating appropriate locations of 
the layer for the object (3), characterized in that a 

workbench (1) with a cutout (2) is provided and the 
underlying support (9) can be raised into a position such 

that within the cutout (2) there is formed a lowered 
region which is bounded to the sides by the walls of the 

cutout and underneath by a surface of the underlying 
support (9) and in that the control system (8, 24) is 

designed in such a way that, in every layer, it irradiates 
a region (26) of the material (21) enclosing the object 

(3) and adjacent to the walls of the cutout (2). 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the underlying support (9) can be raised into a 

position in which its surface lies within the cutout (2) 
substantially in a plane with the surface of the workbench  

 
(1). 
Device according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that the underlying support (9) is designed as a bench 

guided at the sides or from below and having a height-adjusting 
device (10) arranged to the side of it. 
Device according to Claim 10 or 11, characterized 
in that the underlying support (9) can be lowered into a 

position in which it lies in a plane with a receiving 
plate (12) adjacent to the side. 
Device according to Claim 12, characterized by a 
discharging device (19), acting on the container wall 

(26), for displacing the container (28) enclosing the 
object from the underlying support (9) onto the receiving 

plate (12). 
Device according to Claim 12 or 13, characterized 

by a closable opening (13) for the discharge of the 
container (28) enclosing the object (3). 
Device according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that there is provided a removal container (15), which 

can be connected right up against the closable opening 
(13). 
Device according to Claim 15, characterized in 
that the removal container (15) has an inert gas supply, 

preferably a nitrogen supply (17), and also a variable-output 
heater (18). 
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 16, 
characterized by a radiation heater (23) directed at the 

material layer.
