<ABSTRACT>
To prevent an erroneous operation of the key 
interlock mechanism (cylinder key) (60) and further to 

improve the function of the key interlock mechanism and the 
operability of the shift lever (30), a shift lever 

apparatus comprises: a shift lever (30) having a position 
pin (31) shifted between a park position (P) and drive 

positions; a shift lever lock mechanism (40) for locking 
the position pin located at the park position having: a key 

lock lever (41) formed with a first arm portion (41a) and a 
second arm portion (41b); a support lever (42) pivotally 

supported by the second arm portion (41b) of the key lock 
lever and formed with an end arm portion (42a), the 

position pin (31) being pinched between the first arm 
portion (41a) of the key lock lever (41) and the end arm 

portion (42a) of the support lever (42); a first spring 
(44) for urging the first arm portion (41a) of the key lock 

lever (41) toward the position pin; a second spring (45) 
for urging the end arm portion (42a) of the support lever 

(42) toward the position pin; and a lock lever (43) 
associated with the key lock lever (41) to lock the 

position pin located at the park position; an actuator (46) 
for selectively pivoting the lock lever (43) between lock 

and unlock positions of the position pin located at the 
park position; and a key interlock mechanism (60) driven by 

an engine key and linked with the second arm portion (41d)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shift lever 
apparatus, as indicated in the preamble portion of claim 1 and more specifically to a shift lever apparatus 
for an automatic transmission of an automotive vehicle, 
which is provided with both a shift lever lock mechanism 
and a key interlock mechanism linked with the shift lever 
lock mechanism. Such a shift lever apparatus is already known from document 
JP-A-4119251. In this case, a position pin is pinched between 
a first upper arm portion of the key lock lever and a lower arm 
portion of a support lever. If an engine key is switched to an 
unlock position, an actuator moves the lower arm portion of the 
support lever into an unlocked state relative to the first 
upper arm portion by pivoting around a pivot pin attached to a 
lower support. The first upper arm portion also pivots urged 
by the force of a single spring. Thus, the position pin is 
moved from a park position to a drive position. A further example of the shift lever apparatus 
is disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined (Kokai) 
Patent Application No. 60-135352, for instance, as shown in 
Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, a shift lever 1 is pivotally supported 
by a frame 7 at a base portion la thereof. The shift lever 
1 is provided with a position pin 2 movable in the axial 
direction of the shift lever 1. This position pin 2 is 
engaged with or disengaged from a position groove 3a formed 
in a position plate 3 fixed to the frame 7 under such a 
condition as to be always urged upward. This position pin 
2 can be moved downward when a knob button (not shown) 
attached to a top of the shift lever 1 is pushed.  
 Further, a bell-crank shaped key lock lever 4 is 
pivotally supported on the position plate 3. When the 
position pin 2 is engaged with a Park position P of the 
position groove 3a, an engage groove 4a of this key lock 
lever 4 is simultaneously engaged with the position pin 2, 
as shown in Fig. 1. The key lock lever 4 is a part of a 
shift lever lock mechanism, and always urged clockwise by 
an urging means (a spring) (not shown) and further linked 
with a key interlock mechanism (not shown) via a key lock 
cable 6. Therefore, the urging means for the key lock  
 
lever 4 is also urges the key lock cable 6. In the prior art shift lever apparatus as described 
above, however, in the state where an engine key (ignition 
key) is removed from the key interlock mechanism (i.e., 
under steering lock condition), when the knob button is 
pushed to move the position pin 2 downward in order to 
shift

<CLAIMS>
A shift lever apparatus comprising: 

a shift lever (30) having a position pin (31) shifted 
between a park position (P) and drive positions; 
a shift lever lock mechanism (40) for locking the 
position pin located at the park position; 
an actuator (46) for actuating the shift lever lock 
mechanism (40) between lock and unlock positions of the 

position pin located at the park position; and 
a key interlock mechanism (60) driven by an engine key 
and linked with the shift lever lock mechanism via a key 

lock cable (61), 
wherein the shift lever lock mechanism (40) comprises: 
a key lock lever (41) formed with a first arm portion 
(41a) and a second arm portion (41b); 
a support lever (42) formed with an end arm portion 
(42a), the position pin (31) being pinched between the 

first arm portion (41a) of the key lock lever (41) and 
the end arm portion (42a) of the support lever (42); 
a first spring (44) wound around a first axis for urging 
the first arm portion (41a) of the key lock lever (41) 

toward the position pin; and  
 
a lock lever (43) associated with the key lock lever 
(41) to lock the position pin located at the park 

position, 
characterized in that
 
said support (42) lever is pivotally supported by the 

second arm portion (41b) of the key lock lever, and said 
shift lever lock mechanism includes a second spring (45) 

wound around a second axis separated from said first 
axis for urging the end arm portion (42a) of the support 

lever (42) toward the position pin.

the shift lever is shifted to the park position and the 

engine key is removed from the key interlock mechanism, the 
key lock cable (61) is locked by the key lock mechanism  

 
(60) and thereby the key lock lever (41) is also locked, so 

that the position pin (31) is pressure pinched between the 
first arm portion (41a) of the key lock lever (41) and the 

end arm portion (42a) of the support lever (42) and further 
the key lock lever (41) pivots the lock lever (43) to the 

lock position of the position pin. 
The shift lever apparatus of claim 2, wherein under 
these conditions, a load applied to the position pin (31) 

is transmitted to only the support lever (42), and a slight 
elastic force of the first urging means (44) is applied to 

the key lock lever (41) without moving the key lock cable 
(61) for prevention of erroneous operation of the key 

interlock mechanism (60). 
The shift lever apparatus of claim 2, wherein under 
these conditions, a slight elastic force of the first 

urging means (44) is applied to the position pin (31) to 
reduce a force for moving a knob button (34) of the shift 

lever (30). 
The shift lever apparatus of claim 2, wherein under 
these conditions, the position pin (31) is pinched between 

the first arm portion (41a) of the key lock lever (41) and 
the end arm portion (42a) of the support lever (42) by a 

strong elastic force of the second urging means (44) to 
eliminate a play between the position pin (31) and the

the engine key is rotated to an ON position, the actuator 

(46) is energized to pivot the lock lever (43) to the lock 
position of the position pin (31) and further the key lock 

cable (61) is unlocked by the key lock mechanism (60); and 
when a brake pedal is further depressed, the actuator (46)  

 
is deenergized to move the lock lever (43) to the unlock 

position of the position pin, so that the position pin (31) 
can be shifted from the park position to the drive position 

by pivoting the key lock lever (41) and the support lever 
(42). 
The shift lever apparatus of claim 6, wherein under 
these conditions when the shift lever (30) is shifted to 

the drive position, the key lock lever (41) and the support 
lever (42) are both pivoted in contact with the position 

pin by an elastic force of the first urging means (44) 
without delay of a downward motion of the position pin. 
The shift lever apparatus of claim 6, wherein under 
these conditions when the shift lever is returned to the 

park position, the actuator (46) is energized to pivot 
the lock lever (43) to the lock position of the position 

pin, and the key lock lever (41) is pivoted by the 
shifted position pin (31) to pull the key lock cable 

(61) so that key interlock mechanism (60) is set 
unlocked to allow the engine key to pivot to a lock 

position at which the engine key can be removed.
