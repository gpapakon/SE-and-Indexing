<DESCRIPTION>
 Alphalospori ns and l-carba-l-deth1a cephalosporlnsThis invention relates to novel β-lactam compounds, their preparation and their use, and in particular to a novel class of cephalosporins. These compounds have antibacterial properties, and are therefore of use in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals caused by a wide range of organisms.WO 92/01696 (Beecham Group pic) discloses cephems of general formula (A):(A)wherein Ra, RD and Rc are various substituents and m is 0 or 1. EP 0477717A (Bayer) discloses an analagous class of compounds having a furyl ring in place of the tetrahydrofuranyl ring shown in formula (A).We have found a particularly advantageous class of cephems and carbacephems bearing a cyclic ether or thio-ether substituent at the 3-position of the cephem nucleus.The present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:wherein:Rl is hydrogen, methoxy or formamido;R2 is an acyl group, in particular that of an antibacterially active 

cephalosporin;C02R is a carboxy group or a carboxylate anion, or R^ is a readily removable carboxy protecting group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt- forming group or in vivo hydrolysable ester group; R represents hydrogen or up to four substituents, which may be present on any of the carbon atoms in the ring system shown, selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, amino, alkylamino, acylamino, dialkylamino, CO2R, OCOR, CONR2, SO2NR2 where R is hydrogen or alkyl, aryl and heterocyclyl, which may be the same or different and wherein any R^ alkyl substituent is optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from the list from which R^ is selected; X is S, SO, SO2 or CH2; Y is O, S, SO or SO2; n is 0 or 1; m is 1 or 2; and wherein in thering system the dotted line indicates that one pair of adjacent ring carbon atoms is joined by a C=C double bond.The bonding carbon atom of the unsaturated cyclic ether or thio-ether moiety which links the ring to the cephalosporin nucleus is generally asymmetric. The present invention includes either stereoisomer, as well as mixtures of both isomers.In compounds of formula (I) wherein l is formamido, the formamido group can exist in conformations wherein the hydrogen atoms of the -NH-CHO moiety are cis- or trans-: of these the cis conformation normally predominates.Since the compounds of the present invention are intended for use as therapeutic agents for antibacterial use in pharmaceutical compositions, it will be readily appreciated that preferred
