<ABSTRACT>
A process for the modification of  alpha -olefin (co)polymers to introduce branching, is disclosed. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process of branching  alpha -olefins by contacting said  alpha -olefins with a peroxide compound containing an activated unsaturated group at a temperature above 120  DEG C. The process may be carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere or in the melt form under an oxygen-containing atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the modification of α-olefins 
to introduce branching therein. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a process of branching α-olefins by 
contacting said α-olefins with a peroxide compound containing an 
activated unsaturated group at a temperature above 120°C. Typical commercially available polypropylene is a normally solid, 
predominantly isotactic, thermoplastic polymer mixture formed by the 
polymerization of propylene monomers in the presence of a 
Ziegler-Natta catalyst. This type of polypropylene generally has a 
linear structure. Although commercial polypropylene has many 
beneficial properties, it is unsatisfactory in melt strength and 
strain hardening. Therefore, it exhibits a number of shortcomings 
when melt-processed. As a result, its use has been limited in 
applications such as extrusion coating, blow moulding, profile 
extrusion and thermoforming. Low molecular weight, amorphous (predominantly atactic) polypropylene 
with a branched molecular structure is known from Fontana, et al., 
Ind.&Eng.Chem., 44(7), 1688-1695 (1952) and U.S. patent 2,525,787. 
However, the average molecular weight of this material is generally 
below 20,000 making it unacceptable for many applications. Numerous patent publications disclose the treatment of linear 
polypropylene with ionizing radiation to either degrade or cross-link 
the linear polymer chains. A typical example of such a patent 
publication is European patent application 0 190 889 which describes a 
high molecular weight, long chain branched polypropylene made by 
irradiating linear polypropylene with high-energy ionizing radiation. 
The free-end branched polymer is gel-free and has strain-hardening 
elongational viscosity.  
 Further there are a number of publications describing the treatment of 
polypropylene with peroxides. Such references generally refer to a 
degradation or cross-linking of the polypropylene and degradation 
normally predominates. Generally, such peroxide treatments lead to a 
polypropylene with a narrow molecular weight distribution and having 
both lower number average and weight average molecular weights. A 
typical example of such publications is, "Degradation of Polyolefins 
during Melt Processing," Hinsken et al., PolymerDegradationandStability, 34, pp. 279-293 (1991). Canadian patent 999,698 discloses the degradation of polypropylene in 
a nitrogen atmosphere at 150-220°C by using organic peroxides such as 
t-butyl peroxymaleic acid and
