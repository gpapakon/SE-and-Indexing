<ABSTRACT>
A projected portion 7 extending in a lengthwise direction 
of a tab portion 6 and having a given width is formed in the 

middle of one layer of the tab portion 6 where there is no seam 
before the tab portion is formed by folding back the metal 

plate. The tab portion 6 is allowed to have a specified thickness 
by the presence of the projected portion 7. 
The tab portion 6 thus formed enables the fabrication of a 
more light-weight male terminal fitting at reduced costs and an 

increase in its strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a male terminal fitting to 
be secured to an end of an electric wire for connection purposes 
and to a method of producing the same. A general construction of a male terminal fitting of this 
kind is illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. A tab portion b is 
formed at a leading end of a barrel portion a formed by bending 
a metal plate and to be tightly secured to an end of an electric 
wire. The tab portion b fulfils its connecting function by being 
inserted and tightly held in a mating female terminal fitting, 
and the width and thickness thereof are specified. On the other 
hand, in pursuit of easy workability, the base metal plate preferably 
has a smaller thickness provided that the necessary 
strength is assured. Thus, the tab portion b has been conventionally formed by 
folding back opposite lateral ends of the base metal, i.e., by 
means of folding, to obtain the necessary thickness. However, the formation of the tab portion b by merely folding 
back the base metal plate may, in some cases, necessitate 
the use of a base metal plate which is thicker than necessary in 
order to obtain the specified thickness of the tab portion b.  For example, let it be assumed that a base metal plate 
having a thickness of 0.25 mm has a sufficient strength and the 
specified thickness of the tab portion is 0.64 mm. If the tab 
portion is formed of the base metal plate having a thickness of 
0.25 mm by means of folding, the thickness of the formed tab 
portion b is 0.25 Ã— 2 = 0.5 mm, which falls short of the specified 
thickness. Thus, the base metal having a thickness of 0.3 
or 0.32 mm needs to be used. This leads to the fabrication of a male terminal fitting 
which is heavier and costlier than necessary. A male terminal fitting and a male terminal fitting production 
method according to the present invention are developed to 
overcome the above problem and the invention according to claim 
1 is directed to a male terminal fitting comprising a barrel 
portion which is formed by bending a metal plate and with which 
an electric wire is to be connected, and a tab portion which is 
formed at a leading end of the barrel portion by folding back 
the metal plate, wherein at least one projected portion projecting 
in the thickness direction of the tab portion is formed at 
the tab portion. A preferred embodiment according to claim 2 is characterized 
in that the projected portion extends to a base end of the 
tab portion neighbouring the barrel portion. According to the invention, the tab

<CLAIMS>
A male terminal fitting comprising a barrel portion (1) 
which is formed by bending a metal plate and with which an electric 

wire is connected, and a tab portion (6) which is formed at 
a leading end of the barrel portion (1) by folding back the 

metal plate, wherein at least one projected portion (7;7a;7b;7c) 
projecting in the thickness direction of the tab portion (6) is 

formed at the tab portion (6). 
A male terminal fitting according to claim 1 wherein the 
projected portion (7a) extends to a base end (8) of the tab 

portion (6) neighbouring the barrel portion. 
Method of producing a male terminal fitting, comprising 
the following steps: 


a) cutting a metal plate having a certain shape from a 
metal sheet, 
b) bending said metal plate so as to form a barrel portion 
for connecting a wire, 
c) folding back said metal plate at a leading end of said 
barrel portion so as to form a tab portion, and 
d) press-working said metal plate, preferably before step 
c, so as to form a projected portion at said tab portion. 
A male terminal fitting unitarily formed from a metal 
plate material having a selected thickness according to one or 

more of claims 1 to 3, wherein said male terminal fitting comprises 
opposed longitudinal ends, a barrel portion at one said 

longitudinal end for electrical connection to a wire, a tab 
portion at the opposed longitudinal end for engagement in a 

mating female terminal fitting, said tab portion having opposed 
first and second layers unitarily joined along at least one fold 

and disposed substantially in face-to-face relationship, at 
least one said layer being embossed with at least one projection 

for defining a thickness of said tab greater than twice said 
thickness of said metal plate material. 
A male terminal fitting as in claim 4, wherein said 
tab portion includes opposed first and second longitudinally 

extending sides, said second layer being formed from first and 
second lateral sections unitarily joined to said first layer 

along first and second folds defining the respective first and 
second longitudinally extending sides of said tab portion, said 

second layer comprising a longitudinally extending seam between 
said first and second lateral sections thereof, said projection 

being formed in said first layer of said tab portion. 
A male terminal fitting as in claim 5, wherein said 
projection is longitudinally extending on said tab portion and 

 
is disposed intermediate said sides of said tab portion. 
A male terminal fitting as in claim 6, further comprising 
a neck portion extending unitarily between said barrel 

portion and said tab portion, said projection extending 
unitarily from said tab portion into said neck portion for 

enhancing strength of said male terminal fitting. 
A male terminal fitting as in claim 4, wherein the 
thickness of the metal plate is selected to achieve a 

sufficiently strong connection of said barrel portion to said 
wire and wherein said projection is embossed to define the 

thickness of said tab portion as being sufficient for engagement 
of said tab portion in said mating female terminal fitting.
