<ABSTRACT>
A multi-piece, non-take-apart full-face vehicle 
wheel assembly having a multiple-part disc in which a 

wheel mounting disc centre part (114) and a disc outer 
part (116) are each made separately from one another. The 

disc parts have annular connector flanges (122,124) which 
engage one another in assembly and are permanently 

secured together. In one joint embodiment, the connector 
flanges have either conical or cylindrical shape and 

slidably telescopically overlap with a press fit in 
assembly. In another joint embodiment, the overlapping 

flanges of the disc centre and outer parts extend 
generally radially of the wheel assembly and are riveted 

together. In one method of making the wheel, the parts 
are temporarily assembled in a fixture with the connector 

flanges movably engaged with one another, and the centre 
part is precision located relative to the rim in a 

predetermined orientation relative to the rim bead seats 
by bodily shifting of the centre part as and if necessary 

relative to the rim to accomplish such alignment. The 
parts are then permanently assembled in fixed 

relationship while so located by permanently securing the 
connector flanges together in a non-take-apart mode to 

provide a final predetermined permanently fixed 
orientation of the centre part relative to the rim bead 

seats.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle wheels, and 
more particularly to automotive passenger vehicle wheels 
of the so-called "full-face" type in which at least the 
wheel disc is fabricated from sheet metal, such as steel 
or aluminum and methods for manufacture thereof. For well over sixty years, wheels for automotive 
passenger vehicles (which includes light trucks as well 
as passenger cars) adapted for button-hook mounting of 
pneumatic tires thereon have been fabricated from sheet 
metal, usually steel, to provide a rolled one-piece rim 
with a drop-centre well to which is affixed a disc (also 
variously termed "body", "spider", "web" or "centre") 
adapted for mounting the wheel to the hub or other wheel 
mounting part of the vehicle. Usually, the rim is made 
with both inboard and outboard bead seats and associated 
tire bead retaining flanges, and the disc is secured to 
the base of the drop-centre well of the rim. Such wheels 
are well suited for use with tubeless tires and are in 
extensive use today as so-called "base wheels" or 
"plain-Jane" wheels utilizing discs of relatively simple, 
standardized shape. Although more costly, highly 
stylized deep drawn discs have been successfully used 
since the 1960's to enhance the appearance of such wheels 
(so-called "styled wheels"). Because of the limited 
opportunity to provide varying appearance and in order to 
reduce manufacturing cost, removably attached decorative 
hub caps, wheel covers and/or trim rings have been 
provided at additional cost as retail customer add-on 
options to enhance the appearance of "plain-Jane" wheels. Such wheels may also be aesthetically enhanced if 
used as a "backbone" of composite plastic and sheet metal 
styled wheels such as those extensively commercialized  
 
and sold under the trademark "POLYCAST" by the present 
applicants, Motor Wheel Corporation, Lansing, Michigan, 
USA. Such wheels have a decorative plastic body 
permanently affixed to the outboard (also variously 
termed "street-side","curb-side" or "beauty-side") of 
the sheet metal "backbone", as described in more detail 
in our US-A-5 098 272 and the patents cited therein. Another effort to enhance the appearance of 
automotive wheels has been the development of aluminum 
styled wheels made by such processes as sand casting, 
permanent die casting, forging, etc., and finished by 
machining. Such wheels may have the outboard tire bead 
seat and retaining flange joined integrally with the 
disc, to impart a so-called "full-face look", with this 
port
