<ABSTRACT>
A drawframe with a first drive device (Mx) and with a second drive device (My), which are provided for driving respective cylinders of the drawframe, is characterised in that the first drive device (Mx) driving the delivery cylinder is a master motor, whilst the second drive device (My) is formed by a slave motor, the desired value of which can be derived from the master motor.

Draw frame with a first drive unit and a second drive unit, which are
intended for driving of each cylinder of the draw frame, in that the first

drive unit is a master motor (Mx) which drives the delivery cylinder,
whereby the second drive unit is formed by a slave motor (My) of

which actual value can be deduced of the master motor (Mx),

characterised in that
 the master motor (Mx) is a rotation controlled
direct current motor and that the slave motor (My) is a position

controlled direct current motor and that the master motor is equipped
with a code device which supplies the actual value for the slave motor.
Draw frame with a first drive unit and a second drive unit, which are
intended for driving of each cylinder of the draw frame, in that the first

drive unit is a master motor (Mx) which drives the delivery cylinder,
whereby the second drive unit is formed by a slave motor (My) of

which actual value can be deduced of the master motor (Mx),

characterised in that
 the master motor (Mx) is a position controlled
direct current motor and that the slave motor (My) is a position

controlled direct current motor and that the master motor is equipped
with a code device which supplies the actual value for the slave motor.
Draw frame according to one or several of the claims, 
characterised
in that
 the motors are brushless direct current motors.
Draw frame according to claim 3, characterised in that the motors
have electronic commutation. 
Draw frame according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 the
brushless direct current motor has a position detecting system which

relates to the rotor to make electronic commutation possible and which
is equipped with a position controlled back up loop.
Draw frame according to one or several of the claims, 
characterised
in that
 the slave motor (My) is intended for driving the middle cylinder
of the draw frame .
Draw frame according to one or several of the claims, 
characterised
in that
 at least the slave motor (My) is coupled with an additional
gyrating mass in order to ensure a controlled running-out of the draw

frame in case of an electrical fall out.
