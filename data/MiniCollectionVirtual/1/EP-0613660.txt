<ABSTRACT>
A medical forceps has two gripping elements (12, 14) which can be moved relative to one another and by which two bit members (30, 32) can be moved relative to one another via an actuation member. Both bit members (30, 32) are movably arranged on that end of the forceps which is in the vicinity of the patient. The actuation element can be used to pivot both bit members (30, 32) conjointly in a first range of movements of the gripping elements (12, 14), and one bit member (32) can be moved relative to the other bit member (30) in a second range of movements of the gripping elements (12, 14).

Medical forceps with two handle elements (12, 14), which 
can be moved relative to one another, disposed at the end 

remote from the patient, by means of which two jaw parts 
(30, 32) disposed at the end nearest the patient can be 

moved relative to one another via an actuation element 
(62), and wherein both jaw parts (30, 32) can be pivoted 

together without a relative movement one to another, 
characterized in that, via the actuation element (62), 

in a first movement range of the handle elements (12, 14) 
both jaw parts (30, 32) can be pivoted together, and, in 

a second movement range of the handle elements (12, 14), 
one jaw part (32) can be moved relative to the other jaw 

part (30). 
Medical forceps according to claim 1, characterized in 
that both jaw parts (30, 32) are arranged pivotedly about 

a common shaft (34) at the end nearest the patient. 
Medical forceps according to claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that in the second movement range of the handle elements 

(12, 14) one jaw part (30) is immobilized, and the other 
jaw part (32) can move relative to the immobilized jaw 

part (30). 
Medical forceps according to anyone of claims 1 through 
3, characterized in that the actuation element (62) is 

connected at one end to a handle element (14) and at the 
other end is connected in an articulated fashion to the  

 
jaw part (32) that can also be moved in the second movement 

range. 
Medical forceps according to anyone of claims 1 through 
4, characterized in that the jaw part (30) that is immobilized 

in a fixed position in the second movement range 
can be moved, in the first movement range, against the 

force of a spring (50) away from the immobilized position 
toward shared pivoting of the jaw parts (30, 32); and in 

the opposite direction this spring force supports the shared 
movement of the two jaw parts (30, 32) together. 
Medical forceps according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the jaw part (30) that can be immobilized in a fixed 

position is connected in an articulated fashion to a control 
element (36), acted upon by a spring (50), which is movably 

mounted on the handle element (12) that is not connected 
to the actuation element (62). 
Medical forceps according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the control element (36), at the end remote from the 

patient, is provided with an end piece (42) on which the 
spring (50) acts. 
Medical forceps according to anyone of claims 1 through 
7, characterized in that the forceps (10) is curved at 

the end nearest the patient. 
Medical forceps according to anyone of claims 1 through 
8, characterized in that the forceps is configured as an 

integral component of an endoscope.
