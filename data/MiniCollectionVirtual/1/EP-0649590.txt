<DESCRIPTION>
Component moduleTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a component module according to the first part of claim 1 as well as to component modules comprising transceiver modules according to the first part of claim 28. When fabricating different components such as for example opto-components but also for example small oscillators, filter, power units or adaption units etc, it is of importance that the distances between circuit and components are as short as possible, that the geometrical dimensions are as small as possible among others to ensure that the electrical functions will be as good as possible, the need of space is to be kept down, parasitic capacitances are to be kept as low as possible etc. Also the cost of the fabrication method will be of great importance. As, for example, opto-components are concerned, the requirements are high especially when high speeds are involved. For economic reasons it has therefore been tried to apply conventional fabrication methods as far as possible, but this involves problems at higher speeds among others depending on the physical dimensions becoming to large.The requirement that the distance between circuit and component is to be as small as possible difficult to combine with the requirements that the components are to be encapsulated in order to achieve a sufficiently good environmental protection. This means that concessions are necessary either as far at the distances are concerned or the encapsulation or the shielding or a compromise where both the distances will have to be increased as well as the encapsulation will be poorer. Too big geometrical dimensions means a lowered performance. It is also of importance that a fabrication method is such that testing of the components can be carried out in an as easy and cheap way 

as possible so that the discarding costs will not be too high which would be the case if testing only can be carried out on a high level or with essentially completely finished products. Particularly it means high costs if the series which are to be made are small.What has been said above is generally valid for different components as well as it is valid for the particular embodiment relating to a transceiver. Normally the circuits are mounted in conventional standard capsules but if those have been mounted on the printed board and from there been connected to the opto- components to be driven by the circuit or which are driven by the circuit, it is often the case that the distance between the circuit and surrounding components
