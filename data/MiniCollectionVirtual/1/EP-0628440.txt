<ABSTRACT>
A pressure control valve for controlling vapor pressure 
in a fuel tank (10) has an inlet line (20) from the fuel 

tank, a pressure sensing (18) line from the filler 
pipe (12), and an outlet line (22) to a canister (24) for 

handling the fuel vapor. Fuel vapor flow through the 
valve (16) is controlled by ambient pressure from the filler 

pipe and tank pressure from the fuel tank (10), with those 
pressures acting on two diaphragms (32,42) within the valve 

to alternately allow flow through the valve during normal 
vehicle operation and to prevent flow during refuelling. A 

pressure relief valve is connected between the filler pipe 
line (12) and the canister outlet line (22) to prevent tank 

overpressurization should the valve malfunction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to vehicle fuel tank 
pressure control valves, and particularly to such valves 
designed to control vapor pressure in the fuel tank during 
refuelling or other operation of the vehicle. Fuel inside a vehicle fuel tank regularly produces a 
vapor which collects above the fuel and, if not released, 
causes an increase in tank pressure. Control of this fuel 
vapor is necessary to prevent overfilling and 
overpressurization of the tank. In addition, environmental 
concerns and regulations dictate that the fuel vapor be 
controlled so that it does not escape to the atmosphere. Several methods and devices have been used to control 
and recapture fuel vapor, most employing a carbon canister 
to trap the vapor. These devices differ mainly in the type 
of valve used to route the vapor to the carbon canister and 
the mechanism for triggering the valve. Many such valves 
are triggered by insertion of a fuel pump nozzle or by 
removal of the gas cap during refuelling. These valves 
include, for example, a vacuum actuated piston vent valve 
(U.S. Patent 5,014,742, Covert, et.al.), a solenoid assisted 
float valve (U.S. Patent 5,054,528, Saitoh), a two-way valve 
(U.S. Patent 4,343,281, Uozumi et.al.), and a check valve 
(U.S. Patent 4,040,404, Tagawa). The valve type disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,099,880 
(Szlaga et.al.) uses spring-biased diaphragm assemblies to 
maintain sufficient tank pressure during refuelling to 
prevent overfill. The diaphragm assemblies are arranged such 
that fuel vapor remains in the tank while refuelling, but is 
routed to a canister when the filler cap is replaced and 
tank pressure exceeds a preset value. Several chambers in 
the valve allow the diaphragm assemblies to route the fuel 
vapor to the canister. However, operation of such a valve 
will fail if an equalisation orifice (for example, bleed 
passageway 56 in Figure 1 of the '880 patent) between 
chambers on either side of a diaphragm becomes blocked. 
When equalisation of pressure between chambers does not  
 
occur, opening of the diaphragm may be impeded, thus 
hindering the vapor flow from the tank to the canister. 
Tank pressure could then exceed design limits. Such a valve 
design does not allow for the possibility of contamination 
and the consequent tank overpressurization. Another valve utilizing a diaphragm arrangement for 
venting a fuel tank was disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,054,508 
(Benjey). This valve, however, has no mechanism to relieve 
tank pressure should contamination or malfunction
