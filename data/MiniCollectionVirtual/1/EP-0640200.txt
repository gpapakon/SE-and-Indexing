<ABSTRACT>
This heat exchanger comprises a pair of tubular containers (3, 7) adjacent to each other and connected by one end, suitable for containing a first fluid which is inlet at a predetermined pressure. Furthermore, each one of the containers houses a circuit (4, 5) in which a second fluid flows, in a direction which is generally in countercurrent in respect of the flowing direction of said first fluid. Both ends of the containers are tightly sealed by means of a suitable cover, of which the head cover (1) comprises the inlet and outlet connectors of both fluids, and the bottom cover (2) comprises the connectors by means of which the fluids pass from one tubular container to the other one.

<DESCRIPTION>
 QUICK OPERATING HEAT EXCHANGER DEVICE * * * * *TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a quick operating heat exchanger device.More particularly, the present invention relates to a heat exchanger device having a relatively large surface of thermal exchange allowing a quick thermal exchange between two fluids to be carried out, thereby keeping the loss of pressure at a very low level.The invention may be maily applied in the field of thermo-mechanical industry.BACKGROUND ARTThe known heat exchangers are devices which are normally used in various hydraulic circuits (e.g. for producing hot water for sanitary an heating use by means of a boiler or a tele-heating network, or in cooperation with heat pumps, systems for cooling induction furnaces, co-generation systems etc. ), and inside of refri erat in /heat ing machines.By way of example, tube-nest heat exchangers are known, in which the tube nest may assume various configurations inside of the device, in accordance with design requirements also known are plate-type heat exchangers, which are formed by a stack of corrugated plates superimposed to each other in order to form circuits for heat exchange between two different fluids, which are generally flowing in countercurrent .All known heat exchangers involve disadvantages and drawbacks which are essentially due to the fact that the loss of pressure of the fluids are, in operation, relatively high; consequently, these exchangers need 

 high-power pumps and their operation causes a relatively high energetic consumption.Furthermore, all known heat exchangers are generally delivered in different dimensions in accordance with the required thermal exchange energy, and they are not formed by modular and/or composable elements.As a consequence, a large series of different types of heat exchanger has to be produced in order to fulfil10 all the different possible design requirements, and the production costs feel this effect.Document DE-A-2,236, 954 discloses a heat exchanger characterised by a large thermal exchange surface and by a low speed. - _ The fluid circulating into this exchanger does not contact the whole thermal exchange surface, but only the central portion thereof; the apparatus may not then achieve good performances.Document EP-A-0,057,850 discloses an apparatus 0 constituted by a pair of heat exchanger which are connected in parallel, and therefore the water flow is distributed in parallel over said exchangers.The water flow is not forced, and then the water amy flow only in the inner part
