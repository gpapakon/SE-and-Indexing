<ABSTRACT>
A device to measure vascular function of an 
artery includes a cuff (51) that is attachable to a specified 

part of a body to constrict the artery, a pulse wave 
amplitude calculating device (57) responsive to 

a pulse wave that is synchronous with a heartbeat and is 
based on a change in a volume of the artery, and an 

inference device (57) that infers a pressure-to-volume 
characteristic for the artery based on the amplitude of the 

pulse wave and a corresponding pressure. A blood pressure 
meter (58) incorporated in the measuring device uses 

the vascular function to determine a degree of sclerosis in 
the artery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to measuring, in a non-invasive,
non-surgical fashion, a vascular function that provides an
indication of the expansibility of an artery.Arteriosclerosis is the most common disease of the
circulatory system, and is also the primary cause of a
number of other serious illnesses. As arteriosclerosis
progresses, qualitative changes and thickening of the
material constituting the arterial walls lead to decreased
expansibility (the rate of change of the volume, or cross-sectional
area, of the arterial lumen with respect to an
increase or decrease in internal pressure) of the arteries
with respect to internal pressure (i.e., blood pressure).When arteriosclerosis is advanced, various
characteristic symptoms can be observed. Based on these
symptoms, a number of methods to estimate the degree of the
sclerosis have been devised. These methods include
measuring the speed at which pulse waves propagate through
the artery, measuring the acceleration of such pulse waves,
and monitoring a spectrum of so-called Korotkov sounds.
All of these methods involve the detection of changes in
particular properties of a signal, where those changes
correspond to changes in the dynamic characteristics, such
as expansibility, of an artery.Expansibility of arteries has been measured in animals
through experiments in which the internal volume of an
extracted artery is measured while the pressure within the
artery is gradually increased or decreased, and has also
been measured in humans through similar experiments
performed subsequent to autopsies. For example, Fig. 1
shows the pressure-to-volume curve for the femoral artery
of a dog over a range of negative and positive pressures.
As shown in Fig. 1, sufficient negative pressure causes the
artery to buckle, and thereby close completely, while 
increasing positive pressure eventually causes the artery
to become fully expanded so that increasing pressure causes
minimal increases in volume.Because the shape of the pressure-to-volume curve
changes as arteriosclerosis progresses, production of such
a curve in a clinical setting would offer a significant
diagnostic tool. Though direct measurement of the cross-sectional
area (or volume) of an artery in vivo is
difficult, indirect methods, such as ultrasound imaging or
angiography, have been used. However, in a live subject,
the blood pressure within an artery is readily variable
over only a limited range (i.e., between the systolic and
diastolic pressure). Thus, the full pressure-to-volume
curve cannot be produced
