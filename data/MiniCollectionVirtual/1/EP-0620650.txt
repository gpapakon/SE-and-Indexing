<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interface circuit in a 
semiconductor integrated circuit (IC), and more particularly 
to an interface circuit serving as an interface 
between a circuit of high power supply voltage system 
and a circuit of low power supply voltage system which 
commonly use a bus line. From document GB-A-2 258 101 a CMOS output circuit is known, 
serving as an interface between a circuit of high power supply 
voltage system and a circuit of low power supply voltage 
system. An n-channel MOS transistor is additionally inserted 
in series in the push-pull output stage, between the pull-up 
p-channel MOS transistor and the output terminal of the CMOS 
output circuit. The gate of the said n-channel MOS transistor 
is connected to the positive supply voltage whereas the 
backgate thereof is controlled by two switching transistors, 
connecting the backgate either to ground or to the output 
terminal, depending on the logical state of input and enable 
signals. Conventionally, semiconductor elements formed based 
on the 0.8 micron design rule, for example, are operated 
on a power supply voltage of 5V. In contrast, it is 
intended that semiconductor elements formed by the fine 
pattern technology based on the 0.5 micron design rule, 
for example, are operated on a power supply voltage of 
3.3V or 3.0V since the gate oxide film thereof is made 
thin and the withstanding voltage thereof is lowered 
(generally, it is estimated to be 3.6V). In a case where an IC which is forced to be operated 
on a low power supply voltage because of a reduction 
in the withstanding voltage due to miniaturization 
of the elements is used together with an IC of 5V 
system, the IC of low power supply voltage system is 
sometimes used in an interface circuit with a signal 
system having a signal amplitude (for example, 5V) 
higher than the withstanding voltage thereof. FIG. 1 schematically shows the construction of 
a circuit in which an IC of low power supply voltage 
(for example, 3.3V) system and an IC of high power  
 
supply voltage (for example, 5V) system commonly use a 
bus line. An IC 91 of 3.3V system and ICs 92-1, 92-2 of 
5V system are connected together via a bus line 93. In 
the IC 91, an output circuit 91a operated on a power 
supply voltage of 3.3V is provided, and in the IC 92-1, 
an output circuit 92a operated on a power supply voltage 
of 5V is provided. The output circuits 91a, 92a are 
supplied with output enable signals OE, OE respectively 
and the output states thereof are controlled. Further,
