<ABSTRACT>
The tyre removal machine comprises a frame (1) which contains a 
rotatable vertical shaft (6) carrying a self-centering unit (2), 

and is provided with a rear column (3) for supporting a tyre 
mounting/removal tool (10), and a rotatable arm (13) for 

supporting a bead release tool (12), and further comprises at 
least one flexible element (35) which at one end is connected to 

the rod (112) of a double-acting pneumatic cylinder-piston unit 
(11), its other end forking into two branches (130, 131) which 

wind in opposing directions about two coaxial pulleys (30, 31) 
which are idly mounted on said shaft (6) and with which there are 

associated respective coupling devices for making them selectively 
rigid with this latter, and means (34) to cause them to rotate in 

order to rewind said branches (130, 131).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a tyre removal machine, and 
more particularly to a pneumatically operated tyre removal 
machine comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1 
(see CH-A-479414). With particular but not exclusive reference to wheels (wheel rim + 
tyre) for light motor vehicles, such as automobiles and vans, and 
motorcycles, tyre removal machines are known comprising basically 
a frame on which there are mounted a self-centering unit of 
vertical axis for locking the wheel rims, and a rearward column 
which supports, in a manner enabling it to be adjusted in both a 
vertical and horizontal direction, a tool for mounting and 
removing tyres onto and from the respective wheel rims. In such known tyre removal machines the self-centering unit is 
rotated by a step-down gear coupled to the vertical shaft 
supporting said self-centering unit, and driven by an electric 
motor by way of a belt transmission. In addition, these tyre removal machines are usually provided with 
a lateral arm which at one end is hinged to one side of the frame 
on a rear vertical axis, and at its other end supports a bead 
release tool. Between said frame and said arm there is interposed a single-acting 
cylinder-piston unit which is coupled to the arm with 
unilateral engagement, the bead release tool being able to rotate 
by virtue of said arm, between a rest position in which it is 
spaced from the corresponding side of the frame, and a working  
 
position in which it makes contact with the bead of a wheel (wheel 
rim + tyre) resting in an upright position against said side. In these described tyre removal machines, during the mounting and 
removal of a tyre the self-centering unit is rotated at constant 
speed by said geared motor unit, both if the tyre beads are easy 
to mount on and withdraw from the respective bead stop edges of 
the wheel rim and if this mounting and withdrawal require 
considerable force. However the combination of this considerable force and the 
rotational speed of the self-centering unit, which as stated does 
not change when the resistance offered by the bead varies, means 
that the bead is subjected to a sharp sudden action which can 
result in, and indeed has resulted in, inconvenient damage to the 
bead, such as stretching and cracking. In addition, with the aforedescribed tyre removal machines the 
tyres can also suffer damage during bead release. This is particularly so if the bead strongly adheres to the bead 
stop edge and to its containing seat, and/or if this latter is

<CLAIMS>
A tyre removal machine, of the type comprising a frame (1) 
which contains a rotatable vertical shaft (6) carrying a self-centering 

unit (2), and is provided with a rear column (3) for 
supporting a tyre mounting/removal tool (10), and a rotatable arm 

(13) for supporting a bead release tool (12), characterised by 
comprising at least one flexible element (35) which at one end is 

connected to the rod (112) of a double-acting pneumatic cylinder-piston 
unit (11), its other end forking into two branches (130, 

131) which wind in opposing directions about two coaxial pulleys 
(30, 31) which are idly mounted on said shaft (6) and with which 

there are associated respective coupling devices for making them 
selectively rigid with this latter, and means (34) to cause them 

to rotate in order to rewind said branches (130, 131). 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said double-acting pneumatic cylinder-piston unit (11) is housed 

and fixed within said column (3). 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
comprising a further flexible element (18) having one end 

connected to said rotatable arm (13) and its other end wound about 
a pulley (19) coaxial with the preceding pulleys. 
A machine as claimed in claims 1 and 3, characterised in 
that said two flexible elements (35) and (18) consist of metal 

cables, of which the first (35) is provided with deviation means 
such as pulleys. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said coupling devices consist of frontal clutches. 
A machine as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that 
said frontal clutches each comprise two mutually facing conjugate 

toothings (37) and (137), of which the first (37) is provided on a 
lateral face of the respective pulley (30) or (31), and the second  

 
(137) is provided at the end of a piston (23) which is torsionally 

constrained to said shaft (6) and is slidingly mounted within a 
cylindrical body (22), with which it forms a chamber (28) to be 

connected to a source of compressed air. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said rewinding means (34) consist of a torsion spring wound as a 

flat spiral, which lies between said two pulleys (30), (31) and 
has its ends connected to
 these latter. 
A machine as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
said further pulley (19) is rigid with one (31) of said two 

pulleys (30), (31).

that said shaft (6) is rotatably mounted on the frame (1) between 

two supports (21), (37), of which the first (21) is provided at 
the base of the frame (1) and the other is provided on the upper 

wall of this latter where an aperture (38) is formed to enable the 
shaft (6) with its relative accessories applied thereto to pass.
