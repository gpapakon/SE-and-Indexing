Compressed-air actuated disk brake comprising a caliper 

(2)
 which reaches around a brake disk 
(1)
 and on one 
side of which an application device 
(3)
 is arranged 
which, by way of at least one actuating spindle 
(72, 
73)
 and a pressure member 
(70, 71)
 mounted on the end 
thereof facing said brake disk, acts upon a brake pad 


(10)
 which, on the application side, is disposed in 
said caliper 
(2)
 to be displaceable with respect to 
said brake disk 
(1)
, an adjusting means 
(74)
 which is 
coupled in a rotationally fixed manner to said actuating 

spindle 
(72, 73)
 and which maintains the clearance 
varying due to lining wear essentially constant being 

coupled with an externally operable rotational drive 
means whereby said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 may be 
returned to its home position,
characterized by
 
a stop 
(90, 92)
 which essentially acts circumferentially 
on said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 when the 
latter is in its home position. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 one end of said actuating 
spindle 
(72, 73)
 cooperates in the direction of its 
return rotation with a rotationally fixed stop member 


(90, 92)
 which eccentrically acts on said actuating 
spindle 
(72, 73)
 and applies a supporting force, which 
inhibits the rotational movement of said actuating 

spindle 
(72, 73)
, in a direction essentially parallel 
to the radial plane. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 at one end of said actuating  
 

spindle 
(72, 73)
, at least one eccentrically arranged 
stop surface 
(731)
 is formed which extends essentially 
in the radial direction at a predetermined angle with 

the radial plane and engages a rotationally fixed stop 
member 
(90, 92).
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 

3, characterized in that
 the predetermined angle with 
the radial plane is approximately 90 degrees. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the said end of 
said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 is the one end thereof 
which faces away from said brake disk. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 3 
or 4, 
characterized in that
 a front side of said actuating 
spindle 
(72, 73)
 which has the shape of a hollow 
cylinder and faces away from said brake disk is formed 

as a plane 
(730)
 inclined in the axial direction whose 
transition from the starting point to the end point 

represents said stop surface (Fig.3). 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 3 
or 4, 
characterized in that
 a side wall of a radial 
groove 
(731)
 which is eccentrically formed at the end 
of said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 which faces away 
from said brake disk represents said stop surface (Figs.4 

to 7). 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 3 
or 4, 
characterized in that
 a side wall of a radial 
projection eccentrically formed at the end of said 

actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 which faces away from said 
brake disk represents said stop surface.  

 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 3 
or 4, 
characterized in that
 said stop surface is represented 
by at least one of the teeth of axially aligned 

teeth formed inside said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 
(Figs. 8 to 10). 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that
 said rotationally 
fixed stop member is formed by an angular metal sheet 


(90)
, one end of which is fastened to the housing of 
said application device 
(3)
 (Fig.3). 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that
 said rotationally 
fixed stop member 
(92)
 is formed on a member 
(92)
 which 
is mounted on a driving shaft of said actuating spindle 


(72, 73)
 and supported in a rotationally fixed manner 
on a housing projection 
(202)
 or on a housing recess 

(201)
 (Figs. 4 to 10). 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that
 said stop member 

(92)
 has the form of a projection 
(92)
 extending in a 
radially external direction on the outer circumference 

of an annular element 
(90)
 which is rotationally fixed 
on a driving shaft of said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 
(Fig.9). 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 2 to 12, 
characterized in that
 said stop member 

(90, 92)
 is mounted in an axially displaceable manner, 
and that a spring element 
(91)
