<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treatment of neo-plastic
diseases using polymeric drugs with increased
therapeutic efficacy. These drugs are composed of a
polymer combination with two or more different drugs
attached, one of which is photoactivatable: By
combination is meant either a mixture of two copolymers,
one containing a photosensitizer (photoactivatable drug)
and the other containing an antineo-plastic drug, or a
single copolymer having a photosensitizer and an
antineo-plastic drug attached to the same polymer
molecule. Such combinations are useful for the
treatment of neo-plastic diseases. The polymers may
also contain a suitable targeting moiety. The
photoactivatable drug may be bound to the polymeric
carrier either by a nondegradable or by an enzymatically
degradable bond. The antineoplastic drug is always
bound to the polymeric carrier via bonds stable in the
blood stream, but susceptible to cleavage by lysosomal
enzymes. When so formulated, both drugs enter the same
cells almost concurrently because the body distribution
of both drugs will generally be the same. This is
fundamentally different compared to the combination
therapy of two low molecular weight drugs not attached
to polymer chains because the body distribution of each
drug is different. Moreover, after reaching the
lysosomal compartment of the cell, the drug bound via an
enzymatically degradable bond is released from the
carrier by the action of lysosomal enzymes and diffuses
through the lysosomal membrane into the cytoplasm. The 
photoactivatable drug, remains inactive in the cell.
It becomes activated only after light of a suitable
wavelength is applied (a laser or a chemiluminescence
reaction or any other suitable source may be used as a
light source). One of the main advantages of this
approach is the optimization of the action of both
drugs. The rate of release of the first anticancer
agent (e.g. adriamycin) by lysosomal enzyme cleavage may
be controlled by the structure of the side-chain, for
example the oligopeptide sequence, P. Rejmanova et al.,
Makromol. Chem., 184, 2009(1983). After an optimal
time period, light can be applied, resulting in the
activation of the photoactivatable drug. This will
cause the death of those cells which were not destroyed
by the first anticancer drug.The present invention minimizes the amount of
cancer cells which are resistent to chemotherapy, thus
decreasing substantially the possibility of tumor
recurrence. This approach has a higher potential in
the successful treatment of multidrug resistant
