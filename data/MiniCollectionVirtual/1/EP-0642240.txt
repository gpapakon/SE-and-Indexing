<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a test circuit 
for a test of a traffic signal in a multiplex equipment. 
By using this test circuit, the number of test cables is 
reduced and a working time for the cable connection can 
be shortened. Multiplex equipment which multiplexes low speed 
signal groups, forms high speed signal groups, and 
transmits a multiplex signal, is used in a general 
asynchronous multiplex transmission system or in a 
synchronous multiplex transmission system wherein all the 
transmission system operates synchronously. When multiplex equipment is installed or a 
failure occurs in the equipment, any failure of a low 
speed unit must be detected by the error test for the 
traffic signal. A reduction in the cost of a test cable 
and in the amount of testing time are required. In an error test for the traffic signal, in 
conventional multiplex equipment, many connecting cables 
are necessary, because the low speed units of one station 
must be connected in tandem. If the number of the low 
speed unit in N, then N-1 connection cables are 
necessary. For example, in the case when the low speed 
signal group is comprised of 63 channels and 2 Mb/s is 
multiplexed to form a high speed signal group of 
140 Mb/s, 62 connection cables are necessary so the cable 
cost for test equipment increases. Usually, the cables for the low speed units are 
connected manually, and accordingly, when many low speed 
units are connected, a large amount of time is required 
to connect and disconnect the many test cables. 
Particularly, when the failing units are detected, the  
 
labor time for testing increases, and the cost for the 
test also rises. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
test circuit for multiplex equipment to be used when the 
multiplex equipment is installed or a failure occurs in 
the equipment, wherein the number of the connecting 
cables and the time taken for the test are reduced. In a first aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a test circuit of multiplex equipment in a 
multiplex and transmission system, wherein signals 
supplied to a plurality of first low speed units, each of 
which is provided in one channel, are multiplexed using a 
first high speed unit, in multiplex equipment provided in 
one station. The multiplexed signal is transmitted to a 
second high speed unit in multiplex equipment in another 
station. A signal from the second high speed unit is 
demultiplexed to derive signals that are supplied to a 
plurality of second low speed units in the
