<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to N-heteroaryl substituted derivatives
of propanamide useful in the treatment of cardiovascular
diseases and, more particularly, it relates to N-heteroaryl substituted
phosphorylated derivatives of propanamide useful in the treatment
of cardiovascular diseases as inhibitors of the metabolism of
vasoactive peptides.The pharmacologic interest towards the study of molecules which
inhibit the metabolism of vasoactive peptides derives from the role
that said peptides exert on the cardiocirculatory system.For instance, among the inhibitors of the metabolism of vasoactive
peptides, the so-called ECE-inhibitors and NEP-inhibitors hold
particular interest.In particular, ECE-inhibitors are able to inhibit the endothelin
converting enzyme (ECE), which is responsible for the transformation
of big-endothelin into endothelin, a 21 amino acid peptide with
vasoconstrictor activity.NEP-inhibitors, instead, are able to inhibit the neutral endopeptidase
enzyme (NEP), also called enkephalinase, which is responsible
for the inactivation not only of endogenous enkephaline, but also of
the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a vasodilator hormone secreted
by heart.Therefore, both ECE-inhibitors and NEP-inhibitors are useful in
therapy in the treatment of hypertension, renal failure and congestive
heart failure.The molecule which is considered the parent of the ECE-inhibitors is
phosphoramidon [N-[N-[[(6-deoxy-α-L-mannopyranosyl)oxy]hydroxyphosphinyl]-L-leucyl]-L-tryptophan], 
first isolated as microbial metabolite
[Umezawa et al., Tetrahedron Letters, No. 1, pages 97-100,
(1972)] and subsequently studied as inhibitor of the metabolism of
vasoactive peptides [see, for instance, Matsumura et al., European
Journal of Pharmacology, 185 (1990), 103-106].The molecule which is considered the parent of the NEP-inhibitors is
thiorphan [DL-(3-mercapto-2-benzylpropanoyl)glycine] first described
by Roques et al. in Nature, Vol. 288, pages 286-288, (1980).The European patent application N. 0419327 (Societé Civile Bioproject)
describes, among others, some phosphorylated derivatives of
amino acids endowed with both inhibitory activity on enkephalinase
and ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme). Phosphonomethyl biaryl substituted dipeptide derivatives, endowed with neutral
endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitory activity, are claimed in the European patent
application N. 0511940 (Ciba-Geigy AG). The aminoacid derivatives disclosed in this
document differ from the compounds of the present invention, in that they never bear
