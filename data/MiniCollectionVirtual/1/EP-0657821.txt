<ABSTRACT>
The memory security circuit detects when a memory 
unit (NVM3) has been accessed independently of an address 

instruction (AS) of a programmable microprocessor (13). 
The microprocessor (13) is programmed to provide a unique 

address signal (AS) for write enabling a discrete memory 
unit (NVM3). The memory unit has a write enable pin (P5) 

and chip select pin (P6) which when enabled in 
combination permits writing into the memory unit (NVM3). 

The address decoder (28) receives the unique address 
instruction (AS) and causes a write enable signal and a 

chip select signal to be generated for that memory unit 
(NVM3). The write enable signal and chip select signal 

are to be received, respectively, by the write enable pin 
(P5) and the chip select pin (P6) of the memory unit 

(NVM3). The memory security circuit monitors the write 
enable pin (P5) and the chip select pin (P6) of the 

memory unit (NVM3) and generates a first output signal 
when the memory unit has been properly addressed. A 

second output signal (INTERRUPT 2) is generated when the 
memory unit (NVM3) has not been addressed by the address 

decoder (28) and the write enable and the chip select 
signals are present at the memory unit (NVM3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory security
circuit for enabling access to one or more memory units
for writing information into a selected one or more
memory units under particular circumstances and, more
particularly, to a monitoring circuit for detecting
external access to one of the memory units independent of
the enabling circuit.In particular the invention relates to a memory
security circuit for detecting when a memory unit has
been accessed independently of an address instruction of
a programmable circuit means arranged to provide a unique
address signal for write enabling a said memory unit,
said discrete memory unit having a write enable pin and a
chip select pin, which when enabled in combination,
permits writing into said memory unit, comprising:
address decoding means for receiving said unique
address instruction and causing a write enable signal and a
chip select signal to be generated for said memory unit,first means for electrically communicating said
write enable signal and chip select signal to be received
respectively by said write enable pin and said chip
select pin of said memory unit, andsecond means for monitoring at least one of said
write enable pin and said chip select pin of said memory
unit and having a first output signal when said memory
unit has been addressed by said circuit means and said
write enable and said chip select signals have been
generated, and a second output signal when said memory
unit has not been addressed by said circuit means and
said write enable and said chip select signals have been
generated. Such a memory security circuit is disclosed
in EP-A-0 608 060.Document EP-A-0 608 060 constitutes a prior art
document under Acticle 54(3)EPC. A conventional postage metering system includes an
accounting system for recording the amount of funds and
other transaction information dispensed during the
metering process. These records are electronically
maintained in the non-volatile memory units which are
part of the accounting system. It is therefore important
to detect when the accounting system has been accessed
for the principal purpose of unauthorized alteration of
the accounting records, for example, fraudulently
increasing the posting funds available.In order to provide fund security, it is
conventional to place the accounting system within a
secure housing which includes some means of visually
detecting whether the housing has been opened without
postal service authorization, e.g., tamper seal. Each
secure housing therefore must be visually
