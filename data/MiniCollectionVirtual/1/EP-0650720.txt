<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
composition in which phytic acid is present in the form of 
a salt with a metal ion, and more particularly to a skin 
care or deodorant composition which comprises a phytic acid 
metal salt. In the present disclosure, the term "skin care 
composition" is understood to include skin beautifiers, 
facial creams and other preparations having some 
considerable action on ameliorating corneous tissue and 
preventing the aging of the skin, and the term "deodorant 
composition" is understood to refer to various forms of 
compositions that can be used to remove bad or foul smells 
from every site on the body of humans or warm blooded 
animals. Phytic acid has long been known as a chelating 
agent, and used in the form of additives for foods and 
industrial products. However, the inventors have recently 
found that phytic acid, when administrated perorally to 
humans, has actions not only on removing uraroma and other 
offensive smells but also on medicating metabolic diseases 
(see JP-B 4-76971, JP-B 5-39929, and USP 4,929,438). White cosmetics making use of the action of kojic 
acid, etc, on inhibiting tyrosinase are also known (JP-A 63-208510). Skin beautifiers are now studied from physical 
aspects of inhibiting skin secretions, removing foul smells 
from such secretions and providing protection against the 
skin, as well as from their destructive aspects, and used 
to this end are primarily cosmetics and deodorants composed 
of alcohols, oils and fats, and perfumes or aromatics. 
However, almost all of these provide only aesthetic effect. 
Acne, and moles and warts parasitic on the skin, are known 
to manifest themselves due to metabolic dysfunction,  
 
pathogenic microparasites, and tissue dysfunction caused by 
exposure to light and to toxic substances. These disorders 
are treated merely by surgical removal of disordered tissue 
(eg, cauterization with salicylate drugs, and freezing of 
cells with liquid nitrogen), removal of pathogenic 
substances, and cleansing of the skin; and never until now 
has any efficacious procedure of preventing and medicating 
these disorders been established. Body smell is derived from sweat secreting from 
sweat glands such as eccrine and apocrine glands, but this 
sweat itself is odorless. In the mechanism of generating 
body smell, it is believed that sweat from eccrine and 
apocrine glands, keratin protein derived from epidermic 
cell, etc, cause odoriferous substances such as ammonia, 
lower fatty acids, aldehyde, and
