<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic chip carrier is disclosed which preferably includes 
a ceramic substrate having a circuitized surface, at least one 

semiconductor chip mounted on the circuitized surface, and at 
least one pin which is mechanically and electrically connected 

to a contact pad on the circuitized surface. Each 
mechanical/electrical connection between a pin and a contact 

pad includes a conventional solder connection. In addition, 
each such solder connection is at least partially encapsulated 

in a material, including an epoxy resin, which is chosen in 
relation to the solder connection to enable the solder 

connection to withstand a standard thermal fatigue test.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains generally to ceramic chip carriers and, 
more particularly, to ceramic chip carriers which include lead 
frames or edge clips, or pins. One type of semiconductor chip package includes one or more 
semiconductor chips mounted on a circuitized surface of a 
ceramic, e.g., alumina, substrate. Typically, such a 
semiconductor chip package, conventionally termed a ceramic 
chip carrier, is intended for mounting on a printed circuit 
card or printed circuit board. If surface mounting is to be 
used, then, conventionally, a ceramic chip carrier will 
include a lead frame which is mechanically and electrically 
connected to electrical contact pads formed around the 
periphery of the chip-bearing, circuitized surface of the 
ceramic substrate. Ceramic chip carriers of the type referred to above include 
both single-layer and multi-layer ceramic substrates. In the 
former case, the chip carrier is fabricated by initially 
circuitizing an upper surface of the single ceramic layer 
using conventional thick film metal screening techniques. The 
metal employed is, for example, an alloy of silver (Ag) and 
palladium (Pd), which has a melting temperature of 1145°C and 
an electrical resistivity of 20 x 10⁻⁸ ohm-meters (Ω-m). The 
resulting circuit lines typically have thicknesses and widths 
of, for example, 12.7 µn and 76.2 µm (0.5 mils and 3 mils), 
respectively. After circuitization, the resulting ceramic 
layer is fired in air at a temperature of, for example, 850-950°C  
 
which is readily withstood by the Ag-Pd alloy. A 
semiconductor chip or chips is then mounted on the circuitized 
surface using conventional wire bonding techniques. In the fabrication of a multi-layer ceramic substrate, each 
ceramic layer is usually circuitized using conventional thick 
film screening techniques, and these circuitized ceramic 
layers are then cured and laminated together at firing 
temperatures of, for example, 1900°C. To withstand these high 
temperatures, the circuitry on each of the circuitized layers 
typically consists of a refractory metal such as molybdenum 
(Mo) or tungsten (W), which have melting temperatures equal to 
or greater than 2625°C and corresponding electrical 
resistivities equal to or greater than 5.2 x 10⁻⁸ Ω-m. As 
before, a chip or chips is conventionally mounted on the 
multi-layer ceramic substrate using conventional wire bonding 
techniques. Regardless of whether the ceramic chip carrier includes a 
single-layer substrate or a multi-layer substrate, a lead 
frame has
