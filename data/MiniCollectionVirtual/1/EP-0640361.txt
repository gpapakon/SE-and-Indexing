<ABSTRACT>
Swimming flipper (1) formed by a blade (3) and a shoe 
(2), wherein the blade (3) comprises a body (4) of an 

ethylene vinyl acetate-based polymer made by injection 
moulding and at least partially covered by at least one 

flexible and elastic film of polyethylene additioned 
with ethylene vinyl acetate, having a decorative and/or 

protective and/or mechanical function. The film (6) is 
applied onto and permanently connected by chemical-thermal 

adhesion to the body (4) of the blade (3) 
directly during the moulding operation thereof, being 

previously inserted within the mould (A, B) as an 
insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to swimming 
flippers, comprising a flexible but relatively rigid 
blade and a relatively soft shoe associated to one end 
of the blade, wherein the blade comprises a body of 
moulded thermoplastic material and wherein such 
thermoplastic material is for instance an ethylene 
vinyl acetate-based polymer. Comprised are in the above definition flippers the 
blade of which is formed by a single body of moulded 
thermoplastic material, with the shoe (constituted by 
an elastomeric material or by a soft and elastic 
thermoplastic rubber) permanently secured by moulding 
over the rear end of the blade, such as generally 
disclosed in USP 5,163,859 in the name of the same 
Applicant, or wherein the shoe is constituted by an 
element which can be separated and coupled relative to 
the blade by means of a rigid automatic snap fit, such 
as disclosed in EP-A-0572853, also in the name of the 
same Applicant. Even comprised in the said definition are flippers the 
blade of which comprises a main body and at least one 
insert, both made of thermoplastic material and 
permanently joined to each other by means of chemical-thermal 
adhesion, such as disclosed in EP-A-0579046, 
also in the name of the same Applicant.  
 More generally, falling within the above definition are 
all flippers presently known, the blade of which 
comprises a substantial portion, designated in the 
foregoing and in the following as "body", formed by 
injection moulding of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and 
like polymeric materials. The known flippers of the above referenced type involve 
a series of problems related to the nature and to the 
inherent characteristics of the EVA body of the 
flipper. A first problem resides in that the ethylene vinyl 
acetate material has an extremely low resistance to 
abrasion. Following only a few hours of use thereof in 
underwater environments including rife, rocks or sand, 
the flipper blade is disfigured and altered, as well as 
made fragile owing to the numerous kerfs caused by the 
deepest scratches. In order to solve this problem, expensive solutions 
have been proposed in the past: further to a partial 
covering of the blade by a rubber layer, or by the same 
elastomeric material which constitutes the shoe 
according to USP 5,163,859, already mentioned, with 
aesthetical and anti-kerf purposes, flippers have been 
produced having a blade made of thermoplastic 
polyurethane of various hardness, much more resistant 
to abrasion. These flippers however are

(3) comprises a body of thermoplastic moulded material 

(4), said thermoplastic material being an ethylene vinyl 
acetate-based polymer, said body (4) of the blade (3) 

being at least partially covered by at least one flexible 
and elastic layer (6, 60) of a thermoplastic material 

which is permanently connected to said body (4) by 
chemical-thermal adhesion, characterized in that said 

thermoplastic material layer consists of a film (6, 60) 
of polyethylene admixtured with ethylene vinyl acetate, 

the admixtured amount of ethylene vinyl acetate being 
comprised between 1 and 30% by weight.
