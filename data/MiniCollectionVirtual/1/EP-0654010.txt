<ABSTRACT>
The valve described, which is suitable for use in bag-in-box packaging, consists of a housing (1), an obturator (2) and actuating means (3). The obturator (2) has a bottom plate (20) which seals off the valve outlet (11). The obturator (2) consists essentially of a piston (22) with an internal thread (27). The internal thread in the piston (22) engages with the external thread (31) of a pin (30) forming part of the actuating means (3) which is designed as a twist grip. Suitable positively locking means (16, 17, 34, 37) enable the actuating means (3) to be snapped directly on to the valve housing (1).

Check valve made from plastic for a liquid container, comprising a valve 
housing (1) with an inlet connection (10) and an outlet orifice (11), which 

forms the valve seat (12), as well as a longitudinally displaceable valve sealing 
body (2), comprising a valve tappet and a valve plate (20) and which by 

means of said valve tappet is movable away from the valve seat, the hydraulic 
pressure acting on the side of the valve tappet on the valve sealing body and 

the valve plate (20) is movable from the valve seat (21) into the interior of 
the valve housing (1), the valve sealing body (2) being a sealing piston (22), 

which can be screwed into an internal thread (141) and which is movable by an 
actuating means (3) in the form of a control grip with its lower area serving 

as a valve plate (20) into the valve seat (12), characterized in that the 
sealing piston (22) is double-walled and the inner wall (120) has guides (122), 

which cooperate with cams (130) on the actuating means (3), whilst to the 
outer wall (121) is fitted a wall thickening (123) with an external thread 

(124), which meshes with the internal thread (14) made in the valve housing (1). 
Check valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the valve sealing 
body (2) can be moved into the valve housing (1) to such an extent that the 

full through-flow space (13) between the inlet connection and the outlet 
orifice is free. 
Check valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the wall thickening 
(123) has an annular groove (125), which aids a radial, sealing spring 

pressure of the thread (124). 
Check valve according to claim 1, characterized in that on the valve 
housing (1) is fitted an annular sealing lip (142), which engages on the 

sealing piston (22). 
Check valve according to claim 1, characterized in that a marginal, 
circumferential sealing lip (26) is fitted to the valve plate (20).
