<ABSTRACT>
Cyclopentadienyl derivatives are deprotonated by a process whereby the 
cyclopentadienyl derivatives are reacted with a Grignard reagent in an inert solvent 

which contains from about 0.5 to 1.5 equivalents per equivalent of cyclopentadienyl 
derivative of a cyclic ether or an acyclic polyether, so as to form a dianionic salt of said 

cyclopentadienyl derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the preparation of salts of cyclopentadienyl
derivatives which are useful intermediates in the preparation of metallocenes
and more specifically to an improved process for the deprotonation of cyclopentadienyl
derivatives using a Grignard reagent.Metallocenes are useful components of olefin polymerization systems. The
metallocenes include a cyclopentadienyl ligand which is complexed with a transition
metal salt. Before coordinating the ligand to the transition metal salt, the ligand must be
deprotonated using a Grignard reagent to form dianionic salt of the ligand. In one such
process, a ligand is added to a solution of a Grignard reagent in a 4:1 by volume
toluene/THF mixture. This process is disclosed in WO93/08221, for example. The THF is present in about a ∼ 10 times molar excess to the
amount of ligand and the reaction requires 1 to 2 days. At shorter times, the product
contains relatively large amounts of the monoanion salt.We have now discovered a deprotonation process which can provide
dianionic salts in high yields and purity in reduced reaction times.In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for the
deprotonation of a cyclopentadienyl derivative. The process comprises reacting a
Grignard reagent with the cyclopentadienyl derivative in an inert solvent which contains
from about 0.5 to 1.5 equivalents, per equivalent of the cyclopentadienyl derivative, of a
cyclic ether or a acyclic polyether so as to form a dianionic magnesium halide salt of the
cyclopentadienyl derivative.Cyclopentadienyl derivatives which can be deprotonated by the process of
this invention include those having a single cyclopentadienyl group or two cyclopentadienyl
groups connected by a bridging group such as an alkylene or a silanylene
group. The cyclopentadiene ring can be substituted, for example, with alkylene, cyclic
alkylene, germanyl and/or silyl groups. Such ligands are known in the art. One type of
ligand to which the process is especially applicable has the formula Cp'YZH wherein 
Cp' is a cyclopentadienyl or a substituted cyclopentadienyl group, Y is a covalent
bridging group which contains one or more Group 14 elements (new IUPAC notation,
Group IVA of the old notation) and, preferably, silicon, germanium and/or carbon, and
ZH is a heteroatom ligand of an element having a coordination number of 2 or 3 and,
preferably, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur which may include a radical selected
from C1-C20 hydrocarbyl radicals and substituted C1 to C20
