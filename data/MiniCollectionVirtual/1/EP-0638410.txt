<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of pneumatic radial tires each 
having an annular groove in its central portion, a green 

tire is formed from a belt-tread band (9) having a 
constricted portion (10) formed by concavely depressing 

a belt (5) and a tread (8) inward in a radial direction 
of the tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
manufacture of pneumatic radial tires in which an 
annular groove having a wide width and a deep depth is 
arranged in an approximately central portion of a tread 
portion in a widthwise direction thereof and continuously 
extends in a circumferential direction of the tire, and 
more particularly to a process for the manufacture of 
a pneumatic radial tire capable of developing an 
excellent drainage property even at a completely worn 
state of a tread portion in a tire product. As this type of tire, there have hitherto 
been proposed pneumatic radial tires as disclosed, for 
example, in JP-A-4-243601, JP-A-4-243602, JP-A-4-243603 
and the like. These tires can develop an excellent 
drainage property even at the completely worn state of 
the tire tread. In these conventional techniques, however, it is 
necessary that a constricted portion is disposed in an 
approximately central portion of each of the carcass and the belt 
in the widthwise direction thereof for the formation of 
a large annular groove located at the central portion of 
the tread. For this end, it is proposed to form such a  
 
constricted portion in each of the carcass and the belt in 
the vulcanization building of an ordinary green tire. 
In this case, the given constricted portions are formed 
in the carcass and belt during the formation of the 
large annular groove through a vulcanization mold when 
the carcass and belt somewhat protruding outward in the 
radial direction of the green tire at a transverse 
section thereof are vulcanized in the same manner as in 
the conventional ordinary radial tire. Thus, the 
depth of the annular groove can be deepened in 
accordance with the constricted portion formed in the 
carcass and belt, and consequently a groove volume 
sufficient to provide a given drainage property can still be 
ensured owing to the presence of the constricted portion 
even at the complete worn state of the tread. However, when the above forming is applied to 
the carcass, belt and the like in the vulcanization 
building, it is very difficult to ensure a sufficient 
constricted amount, which undesirably affects size 
expansion ratio of each portion in a tire product, 
tension of each belt layer and the like after the 
vulcanization building. That is, in the above vulcanized tire, the size 
expansion amount in the vulcanization building is small 
in the constricted portion of the belt, while the size 
expansion amount becomes large in the portion of the  
 
belt located apart

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing a pneumatic radial tire 
comprising a tread wherein an annular groove (14) is 

arranged in an approximately central portion of the 
tread in a widthwise direction thereof and continuously 

extends in a circumferential direction of the tread, 
characterized in that a constricted portion (10) formed 

by concavely depressing a belt (5) and a tread (8) 
inward in a radial direction of the tire is formed on an 

approximately central portion of a cylindrical 
belt-tread band (9) in a widthwise direction thereof, and 

the belt-tread band (9) is fitted onto an outer side of 
a green case to form a green tire (11) in which an 

annular concave groove (14) is existent in an 
approximately central portion of the green tire (11) in 

a widthwise direction thereof as it is. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the belt 
(5) is stuck onto an outer periphery of an approximately 

cylindrical and smooth belt-tread forming drum, and then 
the drum is subjected to a locally size-enlarging or 

reducing deformation and the tread (8) is placed on the 
outer periphery of the belt (5) to form the belt-tread 

band (9) having constricted portions of the belt and 
tread in an approximately central portion thereof in  

 
its widthwise direction, and thereafter the belt-tread 

band (9) is fitted onto the outer side of the green case 
and built to form a green tire (11) having an annular 

concave groove (14) in an approximately central portion 
thereof in its widthwise direction. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the 
belt-tread band (9) is provided with an auxiliary belt 

layer(s) (6, 7) arranged between the belt (5) and the 
tread (8).
