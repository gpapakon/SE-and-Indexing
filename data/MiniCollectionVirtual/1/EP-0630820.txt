<ABSTRACT>
A method for monitoring the flow of material in the treatment of sterile goods comprises the following steps: sterile goods are packaged in a sterile-good container (14). Data characterising the sterilising unit (12) thus formed are recorded and stored on a data carrier (32) connectable to the sterilising unit (12). The sterilising unit (12) is sterilised in a steriliser, and the data characterising the sterilising operation are recorded and registered. Data characterising the sterilising unit (12) are entered in a data-processing device (46) connected to the steriliser. A suitable sterilisation method is selected as a function of data characterising the sterilising unit (12). The data characterising the sterilising unit (12) and the sterilisation operation are stored jointly.

<CLAIMS>
A method of monitoring the material flow in the 
processing of sterile material, the latter being packed 

in a sterile material container (14), data identifying 
the resulting sterilisation unit (12) being acquired 

and stored on a data support (32) adapted to be 
connected to the sterilisation unit (12), said unit 

(12) is sterilised in a steriliser (36) and the data 
identifying the sterilising operation are acquired and 

recorded, characterised in that data identifying the 
sterilisation unit (12) are input into a data 

processing device (46) connected to the steriliser 
(36), in that a suitable sterilisation process is 

selected according to the data identifying the 
sterilisation unit (12), and in that the data 

identifying the sterilisation unit (12) and the 
sterilisation operation are stored jointly. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the data identifying the sterilisation unit (12) 

and the sterilisation operation are recorded on a 
protocol (50). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the data are recorded in machine-readable form 

on the protocols (50) and/or the data supports (32, 34) 
connectable to the units (12) for sterilisation. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that before sterilisation of a sterile 

material charge a plurality of sterilisation units (12) 
are combined and a collective data support (34) in  

 
addition to the data supports (32) associated with the 

individual units (12) is prepared for the plurality of 
units and contains the data identifying said units 

(12). 
A method according to claim 4, characterised in 
that a charge protocol is prepared for the sterile 

material charge comprising a plurality of sterile 
material units (12) and subjected to the same 

sterilisation operation. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the data supports (32) are 

adapted to be releasably connected to the sterile 
material units (12). 
A method according to claim 6, characterised in 
that adhesive labels are used as data supports (32). 
A method according to claim 6 or 7, characterised 
in that each data support comprises two sections on 

which identical sets of data are recorded, one of the 
sections being removed by the sterile material consumer 

from the sterilisation unit, while the other remains on 
th
e sterilisation unit returned by the consumer for 
renewed sterilisation. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the data supports (32) for the 

sterilisation units (12) and the protocols (50) are 
prepared by electronic data processing devices (16; 46, 

44), in that the operator identifies himself at the 
associated device by inputting a personal  

 
identification, and in that the personal identification 

is recorded on the data support (32) or protocol (34). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that when a sterilised sterilisation 

unit (12) is delivered to a consumer the data on the 
data support (32) are again acquired and stored 

together with data identifying the consumer and the 
circumstances of delivery. 
A method according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the data stored on delivery of the sterilisation 

unit (12) to a consumer is transmitted to the data 
processing device (46) of the steriliser (36), where it 

is tested against the data already stored for the 
associated sterilisation unit (12) and in that a 

release signal depending upon the result of the test is 
transmitted to the delivery station and an inventory 

control is carried out. 
A system for monitoring the flow of material in 
the processing of sterile material, comprising a 

packing station for packing the material for 
sterilisation in a sterile material container (14), a 

sterilisation station with a steriliser (36) for 
sterilising the sterile material and a store (52) for
