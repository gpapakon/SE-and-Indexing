<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes novel random copolymers and their preparation and utility. Copolymers are described which are water-soluble and crosslinkable and which contain the product of the copolymerization of a monomer mixture essentially comprising a vinyl lactam (a) and at least one further vinyl monomer (b) of a different type, selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and functional vinyl monomers, characterised in that the monomers are present in the copolymer as randomly distributed units, where, in the case where the copolymer contains a functional vinyl monomer as unit, the latter has optionally been modified by means of a reactive vinyl monomer (c), where the reactive vinyl monomer (c) is linked to a unit of a functional vinyl monomer with retention of its vinylic groups and with formation of a covalent bond.
