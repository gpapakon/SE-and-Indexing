<ABSTRACT>
A shared vehicle system includes a central facility 12, at least one vehicle
distribution port facility 14 and a plurality or fleet of vehicles 16, each having a

vehicle subsystem 18. In general, the central facility 12 and port facility 14 and the
vehicle subsystems 18 communicate in a manner to allow a user to enter

information at a port facility 14. That information, including an estimated distance
and time duration of a trip, is then communicated to the central facility 12, where

the information is processed to select a vehicle 16 from the fleet to allocate to the
user 20 at the port facility 14. Selection of a vehicle 16 for allocation to a user 20

may be based on selecting an available or soon to be available vehicle according to
various algorithms that take into account the vehicles state of charge. The central

facility 12 also communicates with the port facility 14 and the vehicle subsystem 18
to notify the user 20 of the selected vehicle 16, to provide secure user access to the

selected vehicle 16, to monitor the location and operating status of vehicles in the
fleet, to monitor the state of charge of electric vehicles and to provide other

functions. The vehicles communicate with the central station to notify the central
station of the PIN number of the individual attempting to use the vehicle, and of

vehicle parameters such as state of charge and location of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to systems and methods for sharing a fleet of
vehicles among a plurality of users and, in preferred embodiments, to such systems and methods
for sharing a fleet of electric vehicles, including systems and methods relating to allocating,
tracking, securing, managing and relocating of shared vehicles and, in yet further preferred
embodiments, to systems and methods relating to allocating, tracking, securing, managing,
relocating and charging of shared electric vehicles.In most modern, industrial countries, private automobiles play an important and
sometimes indispensable role as a means for transporting people within and beyond local areas,
for example, to and from places of work, study or worship, on errand trips or in commercial
activities, such as deliveries, sales visits, repair visits or the like. As a result of these important
roles, the number of automobiles in and around most industrialized cities and neighboring
regions continues to grow. The increasing numbers of automobiles results in higher occurrences
of traffic jams and higher demands for parking spaces.Mass transit systems, such as busses, commuter trains, subways, streetcars or the like can
fulfill some of the transportation needs of those communities and municipalities that have such 
systems. However, travel with such systems is confined to pre-set stop locations and times, set
by the route and time schedule of the bus, train, subway or streetcar. The prescribed routes and
time schedules typically do not meet many travelers' needs or are too inconvenient for practical
usage of the mass transportation system by some travelers. For many mass transportation users,
the pre-set stop location is far enough from their origination or destination locations that they
must find additional modes of transportation to or from the pre-set stop. For example, some
users drive private vehicles to and from pre-set stop locations and park the vehicles near the stop
locations. Some mass transportation systems even provide vehicle parking facilities near pre-set
stop locations for such users.For example, commuter train stops and bus stops in and near some cites are often
provided with parking lots for train users to park private vehicles. However, vehicles in such
parking lots typically remain parked throughout a large part of the day, and are driven only in
the morning to bring the user to the train or bus stop and in the evening to take from the train or
bus stop. Thus, while modem mass transportation systems can
