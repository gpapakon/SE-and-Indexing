<ABSTRACT>
A phenoxymethylpyrimidine derivative represented by general formula (1) and a herbicide containing the same as an active 
ingredient, wherein X represents halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower acyloxy or nitro ; n represents an integer of 0, 1 or 

2 ; Y represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, substituted lower alkyl, substituted lower alkenyl, substituted 
lower alkynyl, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, or optionally alkyl-substituted 

ammonium ; and R¹ and R² represent each independently 
lower alkyl. This compound has a high herbicidal effect, a wide herbicidal spectrum and a high safety for crops 

and hence is useful as a herbicide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel phenoxymethylpyrimidine 
derivative and the utilization thereof as a 
herbicide. More detailedly, this invention relates to a 
novel phenoxymethylpyrimidine derivative having such 
structure that a phenyl group having a specific substituent 
binds to the 2-position of a 4,6-di-lower 
alkoxypyrimidine through an oxygen atom and a methylene 
group, a herbicide containing it as an effective 
ingredient, and a method for the control or weed killing 
of weeds comprising applying the herbicide onto a piece 
of agricultural land. Heretofore, many proposals have been made over 
many years about compounds having a phenoxypyrimidine 
skeleton and the utilization thereof as a herbicide. 
Representative literatures thereon are introduced below. The following phenoxypyrimidine derivatives are 
disclosed as representative examples in this publication. 
wherein R'₃ denotes a halogen atom. It is disclosed in this publication that the 
above compounds have a miticidal action, but there is no 
suggestion about a herbicidal action. In this publication, the following substituted 
phenoxypyrimidine derivatives are disclosed and suggested  
 
to have a herbicidal activity, but specific herbicidal 
activities are not disclosed at all. 
In this publication, the following phenoxypyrimidine 
derivatives having a herbicidal activity are, 
for example, disclosed. 
In this publication, a pyrimidine derivative 
represented by the following general formula and a 
herbicide containing it as an effective ingredient are 
disclosed. 
wherein X denotes O or S. In this publication, a 2-phenoxypyrimidine 
derivative represented by the following general formula 
and a herbicide containing it as an effective ingredient 
are disclosed. 
However, compounds disclosed in the above 
literatures do not necessarily have satisfactory 
performance in practical viewpoints on aspects such as 
weed killing spectrum, the amount thereof to be applied 
and crop selectivity, and the development of further 
excellent herbicides is desired. The present inventors intensely studied for 
development of a herbicide having a wide weed killing 
spectrum and a high herbicidal effect and excellent in 
safety on crops, and as a result they found that 
phenoxymethylpyrimidine derivatives having such specific 
structure that a phenyl group binds to the 2-position of 
a di-lower alkoxypyrimidine through an oxygen atom and a 
methylene group exhibit an excellent herbicidal effect on 
not only annual but perennial weeds and, in addition, 
ha
