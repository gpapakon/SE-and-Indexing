<ABSTRACT>
In a method of making a lined trench in the ground, a 
trench is dug into the ground, and, immediately after that, 

shells are placed consecutively and in sealed adjoining 
relation in the trench, and are anchored by anchoring 

elements. The shells are composed of engaging shell elements, 
around which a prestressing element is provided, the shells 

being supported at the upper ends by the anchoring elements. 
The invention further comprises the lining produced according 

to this method, as well as an apparatus for implementing the 
method, which comprises a leading digging machine and a 

trailing shell-mounting device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of making a lined
trench in the ground, wherein successively a trench is dug
into the ground, and, immediately after that, shells are
placed consecutively and in sealed adjoining relation in the
trench, said adjoining shells being anchored to each other by
anchoring elements. The invention further relates to such a
lined trench and to an apparatus for making such lined trench
with the method according to the invention.BE-A-894.870 describes such a method of making a
lined trench in the ground, wherein successively a trench is
dug into the ground and immediately after that shells are
placed consecutively and in sealed adjoining relation to each
other in the trench. The apparatus for making the lined trench
comprises a leading digging machine and a traling shell
mounting device. The shells are shaped as prefabricated
elements whereby the lined trench when finished has a
rectangular cross-section. The problem with this known method
and apparatus for making a lined trench is that in areas with
a high ground water level, the making of the trench is complex
and expensive. Often drastic and long-lasting drainage by well
points has to be executed at the cost of the surrounding soil.
If no drainage is executed the elements forming the lined
trench according to BE-A-894.870 will move upwardly due to the
water pressure exerted on these elements from below.The invention aims firstly to provide a method
enabling a fast and continuous construction of a lined trench,
which does not require drainage by well points, yet does not
suffer from the upward forces due to the groundwater level.
To this end, the method according to the invention is
characterized in that the shell elements are combined to a
semicircular shell and straight elements are placed between
the semicircular shell and girders placed on piles on both
sides of the trench to be formed, which girders are positioned 
on and anchored to the piles prior to digging the trench to guide an apparatus for
implementing the method.As a result of these measures, the groundwater level
does not have to be lowered. On the contrary, the upward
pressure exerted on the trench lining by the surrounding
ground and any groundwater present therein, can be made
useful, said lining having a semicircular shape in order to
advantageously convert all ground forces exerted thereon
primarily into pressure forces in the circular walls of the
trench lining.The shells are preferably composed of engaging shell
segments, around which or inside which a
