<ABSTRACT>
A simplified method of sorting scrap batteries and accumulators of different shapes, sizes and chemical compositions consists in measuring several physical parameters during shifting of the batteries or accumulators through a measuring device: at least one dimension, the metallic mass and/or the mass (total weight), the ferromagnetic mass and preferably a derivative of the ferromagnetic mass by filtering of harmonics, or measurement of a colour or distinctive sign. For each type of battery or accumulator, an identification signal or signature consisting of a characteristic combination of the digital values of the measured parameters is established and, based on the identification signal, a sorting signal is determined according to battery or accumulator chemical composition.
