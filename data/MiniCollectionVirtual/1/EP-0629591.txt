<ABSTRACT>
A UV absorbing soda-lime glass containing specific 
amounts of cerium oxide and iron oxide permits the use 

of significantly less Ce0â‚‚ than is used in prior art 
glass. The amount of cerium oxide and iron oxide 

present is .02-.07 wt. % and 02-.06 wt. %, 
respectively, with a combined total typically no more 

than .13 wt. %. This glass is useful for fluorescent 
lamp envelopes in absorbing UVB radiation having a 

wavelength between 280-320 nm, while being transparent 
to visible light radiation without effecting the color 

of the light emitted by the lamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to UV absorbing glass 
useful for lamp envelopes. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a soda-lime glass which absorbs UV 
radiation below 320 nm and which contains both iron 
oxide and cerium oxide as the UV absorbing materials in 
the glass. Electric arc discharge lamps having mercury in the 
arc discharge emit ultraviolet (hereinafter "UV") 
radiation which at wavelengths below 320 nm are harmful 
to the human eye, fabrics, plastics and other 
materials. Such lamps include fluorescent lamps, 
mercury vapor lamps and metal halide lamps. For high 
intensity arc discharge lamps such as the mercury vapor 
and metal halide lamps, UV emission has been 
substantially reduced or eliminated by the use of such 
lamps in fixtures having lenses which absorb UV 
radiation and also by using outer glass jackets 
surrounding the lamp wherein the jacket contains UV 
absorbing materials. With fluorescent lamps, the 
combination of one or more phosphor layers adjacent the 
inner wall of the lamp envelope and a lamp envelope 
containing relatively large amounts of iron oxide in 
the glass has been sufficient to reduce the UV 
radiation emitted by these lamps to satisfactory levels 
that are not harmful to the surrounding environment or 
to humans. Iron oxide absorbs UV radiation, including  
 
the harmful UVB radiation between 280-320 nm. However, 
the use of significant quantities of iron in lamp glass 
tends to make the glass slightly discolored, thereby 
reducing the visible light emitted by the lamp and 
effecting the color of the light. UV absorbing glass for various uses such as 
lenses, insulators and lamp glass envelopes are known 
and have had incorporated therein various amounts of UV 
absorbing material such as oxides of titanium, cerium, 
iron, vanadium, manganese and the like. Many of these 
materials result in a green or brown tinted glass as is 
disclosed in U.S. 2,582,453. Combinations of cerium 
oxide along with vanadium oxide and titanium dioxide 
have also been disclosed in U.S. 2,862,131 and 
3,148,300 as useful for UV absorbing soda lime glasses 
used for fluorescent lamp envelopes. However, the use 
of vanadium as an ingredient in glass presents its own 
problems in that vanadium oxide produces a glass with 
a greenish yellow or amber color, which glass has been 
suggested for tinted ophthalmic lenses (2,582,453). 
Vanadium is also known to volatilize, thereby 
contaminating the surrounding atmosphere during the 
glass manufacturing process and it also combines with
