<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for creating and displaying a form from a 
description of how the form is laid-out, structured or organized. The 

form description is stored in separate file from the source code and 
executed object code of the software program executing the method. 

The form description includes a description of each of the elements in 
the form. Each of the elements may include a description of its 

position on a form and how it should appear when it is displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to user interface methods for 
displaying a variety of different forms and, in particular, to a method 
for displaying forms from a description of a layout, arrangement or 
organization of elements on the form. Conventional user interface methods usually embed or 
"hardwire" the layout, structure or organization of data-entry forms 
directly into the source code of a software program. The only way to 
add a new form or change or modify an existing form is to add to or 
change the source code itself; hence, a software program has to be 
recompiled every time any additions or changes are made to any of the 
forms. Therefore, if a completely new form is added or a minor change 
is made to the layout of an existing form, the process of recompiling 
the source code into executable machine-readable code may consume 
and waste a large amount of time. Accordingly, there exists a significant need for a method which 
can add new forms or modify existing forms without modifying the 
source or object code of a software program. The present invention has utility in interpreting a description of 
a form, menu or template in order to create and display a form 
requested by a user. The form description or layout of a form can be 
stored separately from a source code version and an executable version 
of the software which is executing the method. Thus, any of the data-collection 
forms can be updated or modified without having to modify 
any source or object code. The method retrieves a form description from a central location 
and interprets the form description to create and display the selected 
form, menu or template. Each of the data-entry forms are described by 
a number of elements. Each of the elements may include a description 
of its position on a form and how it should appear when it is displayed,  
 
such as its dimensions, color or shading, for example. There is no 
standard format for describing the forms. Once the form is displayed based on the form description, a user 
can enter data into the form. As data is entered, real-time error 
checking is performed on the data to make sure it is within an 
acceptable range. The range or limits of the data are also downloaded 
with the form description. Thus, it is an advantage of the present invention that the layout, 
structure and organization of a form does not have to be embedded or 
hardwired into the source or object code of a software program. Another advantage of the present invention is to allow a user to 
select a form
