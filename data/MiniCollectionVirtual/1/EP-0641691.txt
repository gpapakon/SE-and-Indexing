<ABSTRACT>
In a safety belt pretensioner, the safety belt (22) can be tightened 
around a passenger under the action of a cable (24) pulled by a piston 

(36), in a cylinder (26), driven by expanding gas from a gas generator 
(32). To reduce the length of travel of the piston (36) necessary to 

achieve sufficient tightening of the belt, and hence reduce the total 
size of the device, the cable (24) is passed over a pulley (40) attached 

to the piston (36), and also over a fixed pulley (46). On detection of a 
sudden deceleration the gas generator (32) is activated. Gas from the 

generator (32) drives the piston (36) along the cylinder (26). The cable 
(24), one end of which (60) is anchored to the cylinder, is then pulled 

over the two pulleys (40,46), causing a drum (18), onto which the second 
end of the cable (24) is anchored, to rotate in direction A. The 

rotating drum (18) engages the belt take-up shaft (20) in rotation via a 
clutch mechanism (19,19A,21). The safety belt (22), which is wound onto 

the shaft (20), is thereby tightened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pretensioner 
according to the upper portion of claim 1, which 
is used in a webbing take-up device, and which causes a 
webbing to be applied closely to a vehicle occupant when a 
vehicle suddenly decelerates. A seat belt device must insure the safety of a vehicle 
occupant by tightly restraining the vehicle occupant by a 
webbing when the vehicle suddenly decelerates. The pretensioner is designed such that the webbing can 
be freely taken up or pulled out without any interference 
with the rotation of the take-up shaft during ordinary 
running of the vehicle. When the vehicle suddenly 
decelerates, the take-up rotary force of the pretensioner is 
transmitted to the take-up shaft of the webbing by a clutch 
mechanism provided between the take-up shaft and the 
pretensioner, so that the webbing is taken up in the 
direction which restrains the vehicle occupant. The take-up rotary force of such a pretensioner is 
obtained in the following manner. A gas is fed under  
 
pressure into a cylinder so that a piston is caused to move 
suddenly, thus causing instantaneous rotation of a rotating 
drum around which a wire, one end of which is connected to 
the piston, is wound. The rotary force of the rotating drum 
is transmitted to the take-up shaft of the webbing by the 
clutch mechanism. A pretensioner of the kind previously described is known from 
DE 30 40 667 A1 and WO 89/01430. The movable pulley of the 
respective pretensioner arrangements are disposed on a 
respective piston rod extending to outside of the cylinder 
therefore requiring a large attachement and operating space. In view of the afore mentioned, the object of the present 
invention is to provide a pretensioner of the art previously 
described which requires a reduced attachement space and which 
is more compact and less expensive than known pretensioners. This object is achieved by a pretensioner having the features 
of claim 1.  
 In the pretensioner of the present invention, when the 
vehicle suddenly decelerates, a large amount of gas is 
generated and the gas flows into the cylinder. Due to the 
pressure of the gas, the movable pulley moves 
instantaneously together with the piston, so that the wire 
trained around the movable pulley is pulled. The amount by 
which the wire is pulled is twice the amount by which the 
wire is pulled in cases where the wire is directly connected 
to the piston, as in conventional devices. Accordingly, the 
same amount of wire can be pulled with half the length of a 
conven
