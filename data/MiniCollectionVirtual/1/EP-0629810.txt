<ABSTRACT>
A low heat-leak cryogenic system comprising a 
cryogenic fluid (14), a first lamina (12) having an external side 

facing toward and exposed directly to, or indirectly 
to, the cryogenic fluid and an internal side facing 

away from the cryogenic fluid; a second lamina (16) spaced 
apart from the first lamina, and at least one block (18) or 

layer of coherent aerogel extending from the first 
lamina to the second lamina. In another version, the 

aerogel is in a gaseous environment having a pressure 

not greater than 250,000 micrometers of mercury. In 
another version, at least one of the lamina is flexible 

so as to at least partially transmit an external load, 
such as that imposed by the atmosphere, to the coherent 

aerogel, and the coherent aerogel is capable of at 
least partially transmitting a load imposed on it from 

one lamina to the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low heat-leak system
for containing or guiding fluids at cryogenic
temperatures.In the containment or guidance of fluids at
cryogenic temperatures, namely, cryogenic fluids, it is
important to provide a system that will have a very low
rate of heat transmission, that is, heat leak from the
surface exposed to ambient atmosphere to the surface
exposed to the fluid at cryogenic temperature. Because
of the large temperature difference, the thermal
driving potential is very high. Heat leak into a fluid
at cryogenic temperature is particularly costly and
undesirable because of the large amount of work
required in achieving the cryogenic temperature,
particularly, in liquefying a gas to form a fluid at
cryogenic temperature.The cryogenic temperature range has been
identified in publications, and as is used herein
extends from 0K to about 172K. Insulative systems that
perform satisfactorily at temperatures above cryogenic
temperatures usually do not perform satisfactorily at
cryogenic temperatures. At temperatures below the
freezing temperature of water, insulative systems have
low internal vapor pressure, which creates high
potential for atmospheric moisture to enter the system
and impair the insulative quality of a system.In systems for containing or guiding fluids at
cryogenic temperatures, heat leak is usually decreased
by providing a space of reduced gaseous pressure, that
is, a space evacuated of air or gas to some degree to
reduce heat transmission by gaseous conduction. The
structure necessary varies with the subatmospheric
pressure in the space or degree of evacuation. Higher 
degrees of evacuation require stronger and thicker
walls and structures to support the pressure
differential between the evacuated space and the
ambient atmosphere.To reduce heat transmission by radiation, the
space usually is filled at least in part with radiation
shields, a powder or a matrix of solids and voids. A
high degree of evacuation is still typically necessary
to achieve tolerable rates of heat transmission across
the space. The matrix or powder usually contributes
somewhat to the heat transmission rate across the space
by conduction through the solid portion of the matrix
or powder.What is needed is a system for containing or
guiding fluids at cryogenic temperatures wherein low
heat leak is attained without a high degree of
evacuation and without a high strength structure. This
invention satisfies these needs. The invention employs
a coherent aerogel to achieve low rates of heat
transmission
