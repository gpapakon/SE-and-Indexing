<ABSTRACT>
A thermal control covering which is flexible and highly conformable and which is made of a thin substrate of porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene which has a conductive film on one of its surfaces to provide a thin film (usually aluminum) at the surface. A multilayer construction is made up by joining together a plurality of layers at intervals over the areal extent of the construction. The material is light, strong and has excellent drape characteristics, together with good thermal insulation properties, and is conductive due to contact of the conductive films of each layer caused by folding back tabular cut-outs of each layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal shield materials for 
covering and protecting equipment from temperature extremes. More 
particularly, the invention is directed to such materials that are 
also shape-conformable and lightweight. Many types of equipment and instruments used, for example, in 
industrial and communication system environments are adversely 
affected by temperature extremes and sudden variations in 
temperature which may be commonplace in such environments. To 
ensure proper operation, these devices should be kept at uniform 
temperatures within specified temperature limits. There are various ways known to accomplish such temperature 
control, for example, by using auxiliary equipment to control 
temperatures inside equipment and instrument enclosures or within 
the structures housing the devices. These, however, suffer the 
drawbacks of excessive bulkiness, weight and energy usage, and are 
undesirable for applications where space, load carrying ability and 
available energy are limited. An alternative method to control heat transfer to and from 
surfaces and enclosures is the use of high efficiency thermal 
shield or control coverings or blankets. These have the advantages 
of relatively low bulkiness, light weight, and no energy usage. 
Such materials are normally applied closely to the surfaces and 
structures whose temperatures are to be controlled. It can be seen then that these constructions should be 
sufficiently strong, tough and flexible to withstand assembly and 
use without appreciable deterioration in integrity and performance. 
They should also be highly conformable and easily shaped in order  
 
to be closely attached to irregularly shaped surfaces and 
structures without damage. In addition, it is often very important 
that the construction be ultra lightweight. The construction must also be capable of reducing all three 
modes of heat transfer, namely, conduction, convection and 
radiation in order to minimize heat transfer to and from the 
structures which it covers. Additionally, the construction is 
desirably electrically conductive in three dimensions in order for 
it to be used as a path to conduct electrostatic charges to a 
common ground. Commonly used thermal shield or control materials are Kapton® 
polyimide and polyolefin plastic films with metallized surfaces 
that are formed into multilayer constructions. Between layers of 
the plastic films is typically placed an open porous spacer 
material such as a light fabric or nonwoven scrim to prevent 
contact of the
