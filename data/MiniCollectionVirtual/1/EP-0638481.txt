<ABSTRACT>
In wrapping as packaging (6) comprising flat 
backing part (1A) and shaped part (1B), in which window (4) 

can be made, these two parts (1A, 1B) being formed from a 
single piece which has been punched out and folded from a 

flat sheet (1) of packaging material. 
The use of cardboard is preferred, and it is 
possible to use recycled cardboard without detracting from 

the aesthetic appearance of the package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of packaging, in particular a
wrapping for packaging which is called "blister" in specialist's jargon.As the persons expert in the filed know, such wrapping is formed
by a first flat backing part joined to a second protruding part closed
on all sides with the possible exception of windows
and forming a container portion surrounded by flat rims
and provided with a desired shape suitable to the product to be
contained. Usually blister packs are provided with means, for example
an opening or a window, that enable the product contained therein to be
seen through and are consequently dispayed in stores.In the current state of the art, this type of wrapping, with or
without this window, is produced by using glue or a similar system to
join a first flat blank part in which this window can be made if
necessary, and a second separate part shaped so as to hold the product.In most cases the flat part is made of cardboard and the second
part of plastic, transparent or not quite transparent, as described by
EP-A-0 337 228, disclosing a wrapping according to the preamble of claim 1.This type of wrapping as packaging entails many problems and
disadvantages, such as for example the complicated dimensions of the
parts constituting the wrapping, in particular the protruding part,
which must be transported, the necessity
of having to dispose of the two parts of the wrapping in different ways
since they are made of different materials, and the necessity in most
cases of having to imprint each part in two separate operations in
order to apply graphics such as the company logo, instructions, or
other information. In some other cases, such as that described by FR-A-2
617 137, both said parts are of plastic materials involving also other
different kinds of problems.Moreover, in some types of wrapping produced more recently, in
which cardboard is used as a material for both these parts, all the
problems described above remain, with the exception of the difficulty
in disposal.It is further known (e.g. GB-A-2 079 725) to provide a wrapping as a packaging for
a particular product, namely an electric lamp bulb. The package being formed from one
piece of flat material has at least one window through which the bulb partially extends and
with which it cooperates. Due to this dedication to a particular product this packaging
is not of the "blister"-type concerned. In particular, the object of this invention is
wrapping as packaging of the type described above, which avoids
the problems referred to

<CLAIMS>
Wrapping as packaging (6) for a product, which can
be provided with one or more windows that allow

the product contained therein to be seen, formed by
a first flat backing part (1A) joined to a second protruding

part (1B) closed on all sides with the possible
exception of the one or more windows and

forming a container portion with a desired shape
suitable to the product to be contained, said second

protruding part (1B) having flat rims (7) which
totally surround its outer

profile characterized in that this first part

(1A) and this second part (1B) are made from one
piece by punching out and folding a flat sheet (1) of

packaging cardboard or the like all the portions
of which parts (1A, 1B) either directly face or are incident

to one another after folding so that, by printing graphics
or by applying an adhesive on a single face of

this sheet (1), the desired graphics or a strip of
adhesive are applied on different sides (6A, 6B) of

this wrapping (6). 
Wrapping according to claim 1, wherein the product
is rendered visible by one or more windows made

either on the said first (1A) or second part (2A) or
on both of them in correspondence with the container

portion.
Wrapping according to claim 2 in which the cardboard
used is of the type obtained by recycling

paper material.
