<ABSTRACT>
A voltage multiplier for relatively high output current has its 
design output voltage stabilized and rendered independent of process 

spread, temperature, supply voltage and output current level, by a 
stabilization loop driving the switch that cyclically connects to ground 

a charge transfer capacitance of the functional voltage multiplier 
circuit. The feedback loop comprises an integrating stage, stabilized by 

creating a low-frequency zero in the transfer function for compensating 
one of two low-frequency poles of the transfer function of the whole 

circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a charge pumping circuit (e.g.
voltage multiplier or voltage booster), which is provided with an
innovative arrangement for stabilizing its output voltage.Often in electronic systems there is a need of generating a DC
voltage higher than the supply voltage. Such a voltage boosting
function is commonly effected with a so-called voltage multiplier or
voltage booster. However, the circuit implementations of a voltage
booster may be differ considerably depending on the level of the
current that the circuit should be able to deliver.For relatively low output current levels (in the order of 10 µA),
as in the case of write operations of EPROM memories, an often used
solution is the circuit shown in Fig. 1a (employing bipolar junction
transistors BJT) or in Fig. 1b (employing MOS transistors), as
described in Witters et al., "Analysis and Modelling of On-Chip
High-Voltage Generator Circuits for Use in EEPROM Circuits", 24
IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS 1372 (October 1989), which 
is hereby incorporated by reference.Conversely, when the voltage multiplier must deliver output
currents of a remarkable level (in the order of ten mA), as in the case
of analog integrated circuits wherein the supply voltage must be
doubled or tripled for attaining certain performances, a typical solution
requires the employment of at least two large capacitances (normally
external to the integration circuit). A first capacitor C1 is used for
loading and transfering electric charge, while the second capacitor C2
has the function of storing the periodically transferred charge, as
schematically depicted in Fig. 2. The four switches (SW1, SW2, SW3,
SW4) are driven by first and second phase control signals (1 and 2).Basically, during a first phase (1) of the control clock, the
capacitance C1 is connected between VCC and ground (GND) and
therefore a voltage equal to VCC develops on the "upper" terminal as
referred to the "lower" terminal of the capacitor that is connected to
ground. During a second phase (2) of the control clock, the lower
terminal is connected to VCC while the upper terminal is connected to
the output node (on C2), onto which a voltage Vsur develops.If the output current is null, then it is easy to see that, after
several clock periods, the output voltage Vsur would become equal to
2VCC and perfectly stable. The output capacitance C2 stores the output
voltage Vsur.When a load connected to the output node (Vsur) draws current,
the resulting value of the output voltage Vsur will be
