<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a sports conveyance (10) having a frame (12) mounted on a pair of spaced front wheels (20) and also supported by rear wheel means (16), the front wheels having interconnecting means (29) whereby they may be turned in unison to either side of the line of intended motion, a board (11) mounted on the frame (12) to support a rider and having or comprising tiltable platform means adapted to be depressed at a respective side of the longitudinal centre line (31, 32) of the conveyance (10), said tiltable platform means being adapted to be disposed in inoperative attitude with the front wheels (20) unturned but so connected to the said interconnecting means (29) of the front wheels that depression of said platform means (11) by body weight of the rider at a respective side of the board causes pivoting of the wheels in unison in the respective direction upon movement of the platform means (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a sports conveyance, and it is
more particularly concerned with a sports conveyance of the type
having land wheels, with or without motor propulsion, and adapted
to carry a rider after the manner of a skateboard.Sports-minded people derive great satisfaction and
enjoyment, as well as pleasure in demonstrating their
athleticism, from skateboards which enable them to traverse land
at not-inconsiderable speed, standing on a wheeled platform which
must be constrained in its directional requirements without the
presence of steering wheels, handlebars or other manual control
means. Conventional skateboards have not changed appreciably
since they came into vogue about four decades ago. They are
developed simply by placing a board - commonly called a "deck" -
on roller skates at front and rear, and the turning mechanism
has essentially remained the same, with the wheels being allowed,
when the board is leaned by body weight, to turn in the direction
of the lean. In certain further developments, larger skateboards
have been produced - and with sails in some instances - aimed at
obtaining better turning abilities, but without any noteworthy
success. The fact remains that difficulty or limitation in
turning invariably arises when small wheels are used and are
located essentially under the board, with the wheels being unable
to be spaced apart more than say 25 cm.Another disadvantage associated with current types of
skateboards is that their small, substantially solid wheels cause 
them to be limited to firm-surface terrain such as roads and
footpaths, so that they cannot be used on sand or on grassed
surfaces which may include soft areas. In consequence they
cannot compete with grass skis where the latter are usable, and
if fitted with sails or the like they are fraught with danger
even exceeding the normal high incidence of accidents and damage
to the person occurring when normal skateboard are used on
concrete or the like surfaces, especially when their inherently
low-stability characteristics are combined with the low-ability
problems of inexperienced or accident-prone riders.US Patent No. 4,740,000 by Moessner and Australian Patent
Application see 34630/84 by Rouge both disclose a land vehicle
for sporting purposes which includes a board mounted on a frame
supported by relatively large front and rear wheels. However,
in the devices of both of these documents the board is positioned
rearwardly of the front wheels which results in an undesirably
long vehicle having associated

<CLAIMS>
A sports conveyance (10) including:-

a substantially flat, elongate, rider-supporting board (11)
having spaced longitudinal side edges extending between front and

rear ends of the board;
frame means (12) connected to the board (11) in such manner
that the board is tiltable about a longitudinal tilt axis, the

board being symmetrical to either side of the tilt axis so that
the longitudinal side edges of the board are at equal distances

on opposite sides of the tilt axis, said frame means (12)
including a rear frame section (14) supported by rear wheel means

(16) permitting motion of the board in the direction along said
tilt axis and a forward frame section (19) supported by a pair

of steerable front wheels (20) disposed at equal distances on
opposite sides of the board (11) and spaced from the longitudinal

side edges of the board;
interconnecting means (24, 26, 27, 28, 29) between the front
wheels (20) whereby they may be turned in unison to either side

of the direction along said tilt axis;
the board (11) being adapted to be disposed in either an
untilted substantially horizontal disposition in which the front

wheels (20) permit motion of the conveyance (10) in the direction
along the tilt axis or in a selected tilted disposition, the

board being operatively connected to said interconnecting means
(24, 26, 27, 28, 29) such that depression of the board (11) by

body weight of the rider at a respective side of the board causes
turning of the front wheels (20) in unison for steering in the

corresponding direction; 
characterised in that said forward frame section (19)
extends transversely beneath the board rearwardly of the front

end of the board and that said tilt axis is located intermediate
the ends of said forward frame section (19) and said forward

frame section (19) to each side of said tilt axis is of a shape
defining a depression or bowed portion at a lower height than the

tilt axis into which a respective side edge of the board (11)
will move when the board is tilted.
A sports conveyance (10) according to Claim 1, wherein said
forward frame section is of substantially W-shaped formation when

viewed in the direction along the tilt axis.
A sports conveyance (10) according to Claim 2, wherein said
frame means includes rod-like side frame members (13) extending

longitudinally below the level of the tilt axis and connecting
said rear frame section (14) to said forward frame section.
A sports conveyance (10) according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said side frame members (13) towards

their rear ends but forwardly of the rear wheel means, are
interconnected by a rear transverse mounting member (33) of rod-like

form, said rear transverse mounting member having an
elevated portion constituting a rear support on which the board

is mounted for movement about said tilt axis.
A sports conveyance (10) according to Claim 4, wherein the
elevated portion of the rear transverse mounting member and the

elevated portion of the front transverse frame member are each
provided with a fixed journal sleeve (42, 34) to receive

respective pivot pins secured longitudinally beneath the board
and defining said longitudinal tilt axis. 
A sports conveyance (10) according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the board (11) has attached thereto at

least one foot-grip member (47) for holding the rider's foot or
feet in desired temporarily retained attitude, said at least one

foot-grip member being pivotally mounted for quick release action
but biased towards a foot-securing disposition.
A sports conveyance (10) according to anyone of the
preceding claims, wherein the interconnecting means includes a

parallel motion steering arrangement operatively connected to a
control rod secured to the rider-supporting board.
