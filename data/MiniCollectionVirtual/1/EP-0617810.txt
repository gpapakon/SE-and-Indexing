<ABSTRACT>
Described is a device for monitoring a lock element (1) to determine whether it is closed or open. Even when manufacturing and installation tolerances are large, operation of the device is very simple, secure and reliable by virtue of the fact that a light-transmission path (7) passes through the lock element, the light path being unobstructed when the lock element (1) is in the closed position. The light path (7) has at least two optically discrete light-transmission zones (7a, 7b, 7c) disposed adjacent to each other with respect to the direction of motion of the element (1).

Device for monitoring a lock element (1) to determine, 
whether it is closed or open, said device comprising a 

light-transmission path having on one end thereof a light 
emitter (5) and on the other end thereof a light receiver 

(6) and further comprising a light-transmission path (7) 
passing through the lock element (1) that is unobstructed 

when the lock element (1) is in the closed position, 
characterized in that the light-transmission path (7) is 

designed oblique in the lock element (1) with respect to 
its direction of motion (4, Z) and having at leas
t two

adjacent to each other with respect to the direction of 
motion (4, Z) of the lock elements (1) and optically 

separated from each other. 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
light emitter (5) is located outside from the spatial 

light reception area or field of the light receiver (6) 
if the lock element (1) is open. 
Device according to claim or 2 characterized in that 
the light-transmission path (7) in the lock element (1) 

is S-shaped. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the light-transmission path (7) is 

a channel in the lock element (1) that comprises at least 
two optically separated channel regions. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the light-transmission path (7) 

comprises a light wave guide.  
 
Device according to claim 5 characterized in that the 
light wave guide comprises at least two optically 

separated light wave guide regions (7a, 7b, 7c). 
Device according to claim 5 or 6 characterized in that 
the optically separated light wave guide regions (7a, 7b, 

7c) are located in the same light wave guide and are 
optically separated from each other by light reflecting 

boundary layers (8a, 8b). 
Device according to claim 7 characterized in that the 
boundary layers (8a, 8b) are formed by a metal coating or 

metal vaporization. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the light transmission regions (7a, 

7b, 7c) transverse (Y) to the direction of motion (Z) of 
the lock element (1) have dimensions that are at least as 

big as the largest variations or tolerances of the motion 
of the lock element transverse (Y) to the direction of 

motion (Z) of the lock elements (1). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that an alarm signal is generated if the 

light-transmission path is obstructed. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the light emitter (5) is a light 

pulse emitter and in that the light receiver (6) is a 
light pulse receiver. 
Device according to claim 11 characterized in that 
the output signal of the light pulse receiver inhibits 

the further emission of the light pulse. 
Device according to claim 12 characterized in that 
the light pulse emitter is activated with a time-lag with

light pulse receiver. 
Device according to claim 13 characterized in that 
the time lag period is large compared to the light pulse 

duration. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized by a clock signal generator and a following 

counter that controls the light pulse emitter and that is 
resettable from the output signal of the light pulse 

receiver. 
Device according to claim 15 characterized in that

characterized by a starting circuit for resetting the 

counter when a supply voltage is supplied. 
Device according to any of claims 15 to 18 
characterized by an alarm generating circuit generating 

an alarm signal when no output signal of the light pulse 
receiver is applied to the reset input of the counter 

within a predetermined period of time. 
Device according to any of claims 15 - 19 
characterized in that the light pulse duration is small 

in comparison to a predetermined time period while the 
counter does not supply an alarm signal.  

 
Device according to any of claims 15 - 20
