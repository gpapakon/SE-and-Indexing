<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, distinct full motion video segments may 
be reproduced on a plurality of playback platforms by storing duplicate 

video segments on each of a plurality of direct access storage devices. 
In response to a request for a video segment, a direct access storage 

device for retrieval of the video segment is selected from among devices 
listed in a drive information table. The selected direct access storage 

device is then instructed to retrieve the video segment. Finally, the 
drive information table is updated to reflect use of the selected direct 

access storage device for retrieval.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems and methods for reproducing 
asynchronous full motion video on a plurality of playback platforms, for 
example a plurality of nodes of a network. Use of disk memory continues to be important in computers because 
it is nonvolatile and because memory size demands continue to outpace 
practical amounts of main memory. For conventional data processing 
applications, single disks deliver data at rates slower than the system 
central processing unit (CPU) can utilize it. While main memory buffers 
the CPU from the disk, system performance for conventional applications 
is often limited by disk access speed. Thus, it has been seen as 
necessary for improving overall system performance to increase memory 
size and data access speed of disk drive units. For a discussion of 
this, see Michelle Y. Kim, "Synchronized Disk Interleaving", IEEETransactions On Computers, Vol. C-35, No. 11, November 1986. A variety of techniques have been utilized to improve data access 
speed. Disk cache memory capable of holding an entire track of data has 
been used to eliminate seek and rotation delays for successive accesses 
to data on a single track. Multiple read/write heads have been used to 
interleave blocks of data on a set of disks (data striping) or on a set 
of tracks on a single disk. Common data block sizes are byte size, word 
size, and sector size. Disk interleaving is a known supercomputer 
technique for increasing performance, and is discussed, for example, in 
the above-noted article. While data striping yields advantages in data bandwidth, it 
unfortunately reduces the mean time to failure, which varies inversely 
with the number of disks in the array used to store the data. To correct 
for this decreased mean time to failure of the system, error recognition 
and correction has been added to the data to produce so called Redundant 
Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) architectures. Five types of RAID 
architecture are referred to as RAID levels 1-5. See, David A. 
Patterson, et al., "A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks 
(RAID)", Report No. UCB/CSD 87/89, December, 1987, Computer Science 
Division (EECS), University of California, Berkeley, California 94720.  RAID level 1 utilizes complete duplication (mirroring) of data from 
a primary disk to a backup disk. RAID level 1 has been primarily 
regarded as a data redundancy scheme to provide fault tolerance. Because 
of its relatively small performance per disk ratio over a conventional 
drive it has rarely been used in
