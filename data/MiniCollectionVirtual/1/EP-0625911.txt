<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating or preventing clinical manifestations associated with diseases caused by infectious organisms which express antigens which in the patient stimulate secretion of harmful levels of at least one cytokine, other than diseases caused by organisms which stimulate secretion of cytokines only by expression of lipopolysaccharide, which method comprises administering to a human in need thereof an effective non-toxic amount of a material selected from the group consisting of inhibitors and immunogens wherein said inhibitors are pharmacologically acceptable materials which, in vitro, reduce or abolish secretion, by at least one of human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages, of tumour necrosis factor following stimulation with a phospholipid-containing, tumour necrosis factor-inducing antigen other than lipopolysaccharide, and wherein said immunogens are pharmacologically acceptable materials comprising at least one B-cell epitope and which stimulate production of antibodies which, in vitro, reduce or abolish secretion, by at least one of human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages, of tumour necrosis factor following stimulation with a phospolipid-containing, tumour necrosis factor-inducing antigen other than lipopolysaccharide. Examples of inhibitors include inositol monophosphate and phosphatidyl inositol lipids. Immunogens include these inhibitors optionally with carrier proteins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment and 
prevention of malaria and certain other infectious diseases, 
especially to materials for use in such treatment and 
prevention. Malaria is caused by organisms of the genus Plasmodium 
which infect and multiply within erythrocytes. Blood-stage 
infection is usually characterised by severe fever, sometimes 
accompanied by anaemia, hypoglycaemia, pulmonary oedema, 
renal or hepatic failure, and coma which may occasionally 
prove fatal. Immunity may develop so as to reduce the 
severity of infection but takes many years and in individuals 
living in endemic areas complete elimination of parasites 
rarely occurs. Nevertheless, children from these areas do 
appear to develop resistance to the above clinical 
manifestations of infection even while carrying heavy 
parasite loads. The conventional approaches to controlling malaria have 
aimed at: 
(a) preventing the spread of the disease by eliminating 
the mosquito vector or (b) killing or controlling the parasite by 
chemotherapy.   
 
Insecticides have not been effective in controlling the 
mosquito due to the rapid development of resistance and also 
present environmental difficulties rendering this approach 
unsatisfactory. Chemotherapy has been relatively effective 
but is expensive; there are dangers to the patient if the 
parasites are killed too rapidly and supportive measures are 
generally required to deal with the major effects of the 
disease, such as hypoglycaemia which is treated by 
administration of glucose. Experimental vaccines aimed at 
eliminating one or other stages of the parasite are under 
trial but do not seem to protect all individuals. None of 
these control measures have been fully successful and the 
disease is on the increase world wide. Protection can be 
provided by various drugs for those travelling to endemic 
regions, but this is not a practical solution for the whole-at-risk 
population. Various investigators have observed that the major 
clinical problems raised by episodes of malarial disease are 
associated with the over-secretion of tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF), and possibly, other cytokines and that secretion of 
cytokines by macrophages can be stimulated invitro by 
malaria antigens. This originally led the present inventors 
and their collaborators to postulate that antigens which 
stimulated cytokine release by macrophages would be 
particularly useful in generating anti-disease immunity 
against malaria [Playfair et al. Immunology Today, 1990, 11, 
25], resulting

<CLAIMS>
A material for use in the treatment or 
prevention of clinical manifestations associated with a 

disease caused by infectious organisms which express 
antigens which in the patient stimulate secretion of 

harmful levels of at least one cytokine, other than 
diseases caused by organisms which stimulate secretion of 

cytokines only by expression of lipopolysaccharide, which 
material is selected from immunogens which are 

pharmacologically acceptable materials comprising inositol 
monophosphate or a phosphatidyl inositol and at least one 

B-cell epitope and which stimulate production of antibodies 
which, 
in vitro
 reduce or abolish secretion by at least one 
of human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages, of 

tumour necrosis factor following stimulation with a 
phospholipid-containing, tumour necrosis factor-inducing 

antigen other than lipopolysaccharide. 
A material according to claim 1, wherein the 
immunogen also comprises a T-cell epitope. 
A material according to claims 1 or 2, wherein 
the immunogen further comprises a carrier protein. 
A material according to any one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the disease is malaria. 
A material according to any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the disease is trypanosomiasis. 
Use of a material selected from immunogens 
which are pharmacologically acceptable materials comprising  

 
inositol monophosphate or a phosphatidyl inositol and at 

least one B-cell epitope and which stimulate production of 
antibodies which, 
in vitro
, reduce or abolish secretion, 
by at least one of human monocytes and mouse peritoneal 

macrophages, of tumour necrosis factor following 
stimulation with a phospholipid-containing, tumour necrosis 

factor-inducing antigen other than lipopolysaccharide, in 
the production of a medicament for use in the treatment or 

prevention of clinical manifestations associated with a 
disease. 
A use according to claim 6 wherein the 
immunogen also comprises a T-cell epitope. 
A use according to claims 6 or 7, wherein the 
immunogen further comprises a carrier protein. 
A use according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 
wherein the disease is malaria. 
A use according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
wherein the disease is trypanosomiasis.
