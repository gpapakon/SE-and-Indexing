<ABSTRACT>
A pearlescent lamp comprising a hollow glass 
envelope enclosing a source of electric light has its 

interior surface coated an iridescent optical 
interference film over which is disposed a layer of 

particulate titanium oxide, wherein both the iridescent 
film and titanium oxide layer have been formed in-situ 

inside the lamp envelope as a reaction product of 
gaseous TiCl₄ and H₂O. The iridescent film is first 

formed on the interior envelope surface and then an 
electrostatic potential is applied to the envelope 

which changes the reaction product to particulate 
titanium oxide which deposits on the interference film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vitreous article 
having a pearlescent coating. More particularly, this 
invention relates to an electric lamp having a 
pearlescent coating on the interior surface of the 
glass envelope to give the lamp a pearlescent 
appearance and to a process for producing the coating 
which comprises an iridescent film formed on the glass 
surface with a layer of titanium dioxide particles 
formed in-situ disposed adjacent the interference film. Conventional incandescent lamps having a generally 
pear-shaped or round configuration comprising a sealed 
glass envelope with a metal screw base enclosing a 
filament within are known in the art as A-line and G-type 
lamps which consumers regard as ordinary electric 
bulbs. Most of these types of incandescent lamps are 
produced with the interior glass surface being etched 
or frosted and/or coated with a coating of a silica, 
alumina or titania powder inside to reduce or eliminate 
the filament image and provide more uniform 
illustration as is disclosed, for example, in U.S. 
Patent 4,042,747 and 4,441,087. These lamps are also 
available with clear glass envelopes and in various 
colors for use as decorative lamps and also as bug 
lamps. Attempts have been made in the past to coat the 
interior envelope or bulb wall with a particulate, 
light-scattering metal oxide powder coating formed in-situ  
 
inside the envelope. However, these methods have 
not met with commercial success. The light-scattering 
or diffusing particulate coatings are now 
electrostatically applied to the interior envelope 
surface using an electrostatic deposition process such 
as that disclosed in U.S. 4,081,709. One type of 
decorative incandescent lamp employs a single-layer 
titanium oxide optical interference film formed in-situ 
on the inner wall surface of the lamp envelope which 
gives the lamp envelope an iridescent appearance. The 
iridescent film is a reaction product of titanium 
tetrachloride and water vapor. Lamps of this type are 
manufactured and sold by GE as Auradescent lamps. 
Although the interference film produces an iridescent 
appearance when applied to a clear glass envelope, it 
is light transparent and therefore the filament is 
visible during operation of the lamp. It would be an 
improvement to the art if such lamps could also have a 
light-scattering coating to diffuse the filament image, 
provide more uniform illumination and provide 
additional decorative effects. Conventional light-scattering 
particulate coatings mentioned above have 
be
