<ABSTRACT>
Device for positioning a rotating body which is movable about an axis of rotation with respect to a stator body including a magnetic bearing (7'), detection means intended to detect the inclination ( beta ) of the rotating body with respect to the axis of rotation, an actuation assembly adapted to apply a tilting torque, to the rotating body, transversely to the axis of rotation, and a tilting servo- control circuit (7A) having one input configured to receive a tilting inclination datum value, one input connected to the detection means and an output connected to the actuation assembly.

<CLAIMS>
Device for positioning a rotary body
(4, 4') mobile about a rotation axis (X-X) with limited

range of movement in rotation, relative to a stator body
including,


two axially offset magnetic bearings (7, 7') in which
the rotary body is engaged and each including:


at least one pair of diametrally opposite
electromagnetic coils (27),
position or speed sensors (13), and
radial centring control electronics adapted to
receive a variable set point for centring transversely to

the rotation axis,
detector means adapted to detect the inclination (Î²) of
the rotary body relative to the rotation axis, including

said position or speed sensors of the magnetic bearings,
an actuator system including said electromagnetic coils
(27) and the sensors adapted to apply to the rotary body

a tilting torque transverse to the rotation axis, and
a tilt control circuit having an input adapted to
receive a tilt set point, inputs connected to the

detector means and outputs connected to the actuator
system, this control circuit including means for

determining variable radial centring set points for each
of the bearing control electronics as a function of the

tilt set point.
Positioning device according to claim 1
characterised in that the two magnetic bearings have

parallel active radial axes.
Positioning device according to claim 1 or
claim 2 characterised in that it includes an

electromagnetic device disposed axially between the two
bearings.
Positioning device according to claim 3
characterised in that the electromagnetic device is a 

motor (8) adapted to drive the rotary body in rotation.
Positioning device according to claim 3
characterised in that the electromagnetic device is a

locking device (10).
Positioning device according to any one of
claims 1 to 5 characterised in that a payload (6) is

mounted cantilever fashion on the rotary body.
Positioning device according to claim 6
characterised in that this payload is a scanning mirror.
