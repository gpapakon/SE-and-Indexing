<DESCRIPTION>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING MONOSIALOGANGLIOSIDE GM1 OR A DERIVATIVE THEREOF SUITABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE. Technical Field This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing monosialoganglioside GK^ or a derivative thereof suitable for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.Prior artParkinson' s disease is a neurodegenerative disease, which has a high rate of incidence (20 persons in 100 , 000 in the U . S . A . ) and generally affects people older than 45-years .Parkinson's disease is characterized by a dopaminergic deficit, which brings about a series of neuronal events resulting in akinesia, muscle rigidity, and tremors.Symptomatology is believed to manifest itself with the loss of at least 85% of the striatal dopaminergic innervation, consequent to the degeneration of the neurons producing DA (dopamine) in the substantia nigra and pars compacta (Kish S.J. et al. , The New England J. of Med: , 318, 876, 1988). It is to be stressed that although pharmacological therapy for Parkinson's disease has been studied for over 25 years, the disease is still a critical problem especially due to the slow and progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic system (McGeer P.L. et al., Ann. Neurol., 24, 57*4, 1988) . 

As known, the therapy based on L-dopa, associated with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors (carbidopa or benserazide) , with monamine oxidase inhibitors (Shoulson I. et al. : "Effect of Deprenyl on the progression of disability in early Parkinson' s disease" . The New England J. of Med. , 16, 1364-1371 , 1989) . as well as the therapy based on long-acting direct dopaminergic agonists (pergolide , cabergoline) , in the great majority of early-stage cases considerably improves the clinical picture and, in some cases , provides a total control of symptoms . However, after some years treatment, i.e. from 2-3 years min. to generally 10 years max. or even more , symptoms - mainly characterized clinically by fluctuation and dyskinesias of various types - appear anew in most patients (8θ-90/£) .Said motor fluctuations ( in particular on-off phenomena) and hyperkinesias deeply upset the patient who, after years of well- being resulting from the disease being compensated by the therapy, relapses into a decompensated condition that prevents him/her from enjoying an adequate family, social, and work life. With a view to solving the main problem to be faced by Parkinson' s disease therapy, i.e . the decompensated phase , present clinical practice uses slow-release

CLAIMS
1. Use of monosialoganglioside GM^ or of a derivative thereof as active ingredient for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for Parkinson's disease therapy. 2. The use according to claim 1 wherein said monosialoganglioside GM^ derivative is selected out of the group consisting of the inner ester AGF2 and the methyl ester AGF4 thereof.
3- The use according to claim 1 wherein said pharmaceutical compositions contain a therapeutically effective quantity of said active ingredient, mixed with pharmacologically acceptable excipients and diluents.
4. Pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmacologically effective quantity of monosialoganglioside GM^ or of a derivative thereof, mixed with pharmacologically acceptable excipients and diluents, suitable for Parkinson's disease therapy.
5. The compositions according to claim 4 wherein said monosialoganglioside GM^ derivative is selected out of the group consisting of the inner ester AGF2 and the methyl ester AGF4 thereof and N-dichloroacetyl lyso GM^. 6. The compositions according to claim 4 prepared as oral formulations.
7. The compositions according to claim 4 prepared as parenteral formulations.
8. Therapeutic method for treating Parkinson's disease consisting in the administration of a pharmacologically effective quantity of 


monosialoganglioside or a derivative thereof selected out of the group consisting of its inner ester AGF2 and its methyl ester AGF4 and N-dichloroacetyl lyso GM^ alone or in association with other drugs.
9. The therapeutic method according to claim 8 wherein administration is by the oral way.
10. The therapeutic method according to claim 8 wherein administration is by the parenteral way.
11. The therapeutic method according to claim 8 wherein said administration is associated with pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical combinations used for assuaging the parkinsonian symptomatology and for dopaminergic functionality recovery.
12. The therapeutic method according to claim 8 wherein said administration is associated with pharmaceuticals selected out of the group consisting of L-dopa, BDNF and combinations thereof with decarboxylase or monamine oxidase inhibitors.
