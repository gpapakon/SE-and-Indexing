<ABSTRACT>
Device of the type comprising a complex of fibrous and/or textile elements assembled by adhesive bonding. According to the invention, the various elements (4, 5) are assembled using an active refractory adhesive (6), which holds up to approximately 1300@C, and includes components and active additives containing chemically bound water which are stable at temperatures less than 80@C. Application to protecting cable ducts.

<CLAIMS>
A flexible device having fire-retardant 
properties, of the type comprising a complex of fibrous 

and/or textile elements assembled by gluing, 
characterised in that the assembly of the various 

elements (4, 5) is effected by means of an active 
refractory glue (6), having a resistance of up to about 

1,300°C, and comprising active components and additives 
containing chemically bound water, and stable at 

temperatures below 80°C. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the glue (6) contains a plurality of components 

which retain water at different temperature levels, up 
to temperatures greater than 200°C. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that it comprises additives which, 

upon an increase in temperature, undergo an intumescent 
vitrification reaction. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it comprises mineral-fibre 

elements (5), such as those known under the name 
MS 2000. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it comprises coated glass fabric 

(4), such as that known under the name SILCO. 
A device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the glass fabric (4), of the type known under the 

name SILCO, is polarised and has an outer face coated 
with silicone, and an uncoated inner face in contact 

with the fibrous elements.  
 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the glue (6) is an active silico-refractory 

glue, such as that known under the name 
Réf. F.active. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the active refractory glue (6) 

contains hydrates of metallic oxides, such as hydrated 
aluminium oxide Al

A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that it comprises several layers of 

glue (6) spaced apart. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that it comprises alternate layers of 

fabric (4) of the type SILCO and fibrous elements (5) 
of the type MS 2000, the two outer faces being of 

fabric.
