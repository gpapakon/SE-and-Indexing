<ABSTRACT>
In order to increase the durability of tools which are coated with a material of the generic type MeX, wherein Me is a metal or mixed metal and X is a metalloid from the group comprising C, O, N and B, it is proposed to incorporate a CrX interlayer, wherein Cr is an essential layer component. In this case, known adhesion-testing methods give rather a deterioration in the adhesion of the coating. Nevertheless, the durability of the tools is increased.

at least one metal of the group IVb, 
X
is at least a metalloid of groups C, O, N, B with less 
than 50% oxygen, 
 
where between the tool substrate and the MeX coating is 

incorporated an intermediate layer of essentially CrX and 
Cr with a thickness d of 


5 nm ≤ d ≤ 1000 nm. 
Process according to claim 1 where the intermediate layer 
has a thickness of 


5 nm ≤ d ≤ 500 nm

intermediate layer has a thickness d of 


10 nm ≤ d ≤ 100 nm, 
 
preferably with thickness 


d ≈ 50 nm. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the wear protection layer coating is made of TiN, TiCN 

or TiAlN.

that the wear protection coating and/or intermediate 

coating is applied by reactive vapour deposition and/or 
reactive cathode sputtering.

than 50% oxygen, 
 
where between the tool substrate and the MeX wear 

protection layer is an intermediate layer essentially 
consisting of CrX and Cr with a thickness d of 


5 nm ≤ d ≤ 1000 nm.
