<ABSTRACT>
A pack for a gas generating agent for a gas generating device for expanding an airbag that is used to form 
a combustion chamber in the gas generating device for expanding an airbag, the pack being intended to remarkably 

improve its reliability for ignition performance through a simple construction, compared with a conventional pack. 
In the present invention, a plurality of gas generating agents (71) having through holes (69) formed in the central 

portions thereof are stored in a laminated state in a long cylindrical pack (67) in the axial direction thereof. One side 
of the cylindrical pack is sealed by means of a cap (73), and an ignitor receiving projecting portion (77) formed at the 

center of this cap in such a manner as to project therefrom is inserted into a through hole (81) in the gas generating 
agent disposed at one end of the cylindrical pack. Furthermore, ignition powder (85) is disposed in the through hole 

in the gas generating agent disposed at the one end of the cylindrical pack in such a manner as to be adjacent to the 
end face of the projecting portion of the cap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas generating agent pack of an 
air bag inflation gas generator that is used to form a combustion 
chamber in the air bag inflation gas generator. A prior shock absorber to protect a passenger car driver 
from shocks at a collision accident comprises an air bag having 
a capacity of, for example, 60 liters and a gas generator to 
inflate the air bag with gas. At a collision accident of a 
passenger car, explosives or other gas generating agents having 
a similar composition thereto, which are charged in the gas 
generator, are ignited and burnt to produce gas. The air bag is 
instantaneously inflated by the resultant gas to protect the 
driver against any collision shocks, thereby avoiding possible 
serious injury of the driver. Fig. 7 shows a prior air bag inflation gas generator 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Print No. 2-155857. 
In the drawing, the reference numeral 11 shows a 
combustion chamber containing a plurality of gas generating 
agents 13 in the stacked state. The gas generating agents 13 are a circular plate having a 
through hole 15 at the center, and the through hole 15 
accommodates an ignition agent 17. These gas generating agents 13 are accommodated in a 
concealed container 19. At the center of this concealed 
container 19, a concave part 21 is formed to be depressed toward 
the through hole 15 of the gas generating agents 13.  In the concave part 21 is provided an igniter 23 to burn the 
gas generating agents 13. The combustion chamber 11 has a combustion chamber filter 25 
disposed along its inner wall. And, a plenum chamber 27 annually 
surrounds the combustion chamber 11 and receives gas flow through 
an orifice 26 from the combustion chamber filter 25. The plenum chamber 27 contains a plenum chamber filter 
consisting of an upper filter 29 and a gas filter 31. And, the plenum chamber 27 contains a gas outlet 33 to 
supply the gas flow from the gas filter 31 to an air bag. In this type of air bag inflation gas generator, the powder 
in the igniter 23 burns the ignition agent 17 when the igniter 
is energized. The ignition agent 17 in turn causes the gas 
generating agents 13 to burn. Gas from the gas generating 
agents 13 flows into the plenum chamber 27 through the combustion 
chamber filter 19 disposed along the inner wall of the combustion 
chamber 11. The gas is then purified by the upper filter 29 and 
the gas filter 31 and flows into the air bag through the gas 
outlet 33. The air bag can be completely inflated within a very
