<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a rear mounted luminous indicator 
which warns car drivers behind the car of the driver's 

intentions; the indicator has three lights: a green light, 
which turns on when the accelerator is pushed, a red light, 

which turns on when the brake is pushed and a yellow light 
which turns on when the car driver releases the accelerator 

and the brake, with the engine running.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application concerns a rear mounted three-light 
car indicator which warns car drivers behind the car of the 
driver's intentions. Currently cars and motor vehicles have conventional rear 
indicator lights consisting of tail lights, stop lights, 
back-up lights and left and right traffic indicators. 
More recently other lights have appeared on cars (known as 
simultaneous double stop lights) which are generally 
positioned just above the boot bonnet or even on the roof 
of the car - which act as double stop lights - but which 
are mounted in a position which is much more clearly 
visible. The luminous indicator according to the invention is an 
absolute novelty in this technical field; the indicator 
according to the invention is designed to provide quite 
clearly from the rear of the car, different indications 
regarding the driver's intentions with respect to those 
provided by conventional indicator lights.  Car drivers behind a car with the device according to the 
invention will be warned of the driver's actions even 
before the conventional indicator lights, such as the left 
and right traffic indicators and stop lights, turn on. 
The device according to the invention is designed for 
mounting in a clearly visible position on the back of the 
vehicle (for example above the boot bonnet, on the roof or 
even inside the rearview window), thereby being clearly 
visible to other drivers; it can be mounted as a single 
element at the centre of the car, or in two elements, one 
on each side of the back of the vehicle. It is obvious that the device according to the invention 
may to all effects and purposes be considered as a safety 
device, in that its main purpose is to reduce as far as 
possible - or even prevent entirely - the risk of rear 
collision between quelled cars - this type of accident being 
not only extremely frequent but also very dangerous. In particular, the luminous indicator according to the 
invention has three differently coloured lights: a green 
light, a yellow light and a red light. The choice of colours is intentional in that the same 
correspond to the same signals transmitted by traffic 
lights: the red light warns the driver behind that he must 
brake; the yellow light warns the driver behind to slow 
down and proceed with caution; the green light is a "road 
clear" signal and means that the driver behind can continue 
driving at the same speed or even accelerate.  In structural terms, the three indicator lights are 
characterized by an electrical circuit connected
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rear mounted luminous three-light car indicator 
characterized in that the lights used are green (V), yellow 

(G) and red (R), the same being connected electrically to 
the car ignition, the brake and the accelerator, so that 

the yellow light (G) turns on when the engine is turned on 
thereby staying on until the brake is pushed, followed by 

lighting up of the red light (R), or until the accelerator 
is pushed, followed by lighting up of the green light (V); 

when the brake and the accelerator are released, thereby 
turning off the red light (R) and the green light (V) 

respectively, the yellow light (G) will turn on. 
A rear mounted luminous three-light car indicator, 
according to claim 1, characterized by an electrical 

circuit having a main line connected directly to the 
battery (1) of the car designed to supply power to the 

yellow light (G) having a circuit-breaker (2) along the 
line and two circuit breakers-switches (3) and (4), the 

first of which (3) commutes the power of the main line to a 
second line which carries current to the green light (V), 

 
while the second circuit breaker-switch (4) commutes the 

power of the main line to a third line which carries 
current to the red light (R); moreover, the device 

according to the invention is so designed that upon 
ignition of the engine, circuit breaker (2) closes the main 

line thereby turning on the yellow light (G), thanks also 
to the fact that the above circuit breakers-switches (3) 

and (4) on hold, are automatically positioned to ensure the 
continuity of the main line; moreover, by pushing down the 

accelerator, the circuit breaker-switch (3) is commuted 
from the main line - namely the power supply line of the 

yellow light (G) - to the line which carries current to the 
green light (V), while by pushing down the brake, the 

circuit breaker-switch (4) is commuted from the above main 
line to the line which carries power to the red light (R).
