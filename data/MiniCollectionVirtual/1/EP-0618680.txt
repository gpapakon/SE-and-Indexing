<ABSTRACT>
The optoelectronic finger-operated keyboard to be used in industrial measuring instruments is designed with respect to an optimum signal/noise ratio and the least possible drop in intensity of the infrared light transmitters during the operating time of the measuring instrument. The keys for generating in each case one associated useful pre-operation signal (n1, n2, n3) have for this purpose an infrared-transparent cover (1), an infrared light transmitter (3) which is arranged on the inside (12) of the cover for each key and radiates virtually vertically with respect to the cover and tightly focused, an infrared light receiver (4) which is arranged adjacently to the transmitter and separated therefrom by an infrared-opaque shield (5) and aligned towards the cover, which receiver is located within the main radiating area of the radiated infrared scattered from a finger (2) but outside the infrared reflected from the outside and/or inside of the cover. An operating circuit (8) comprises a separate control and detection circuit (15, 25, 35) for each key, which, for feeding the light transmitter (13, 23, 33), generates current control pulses (si1, si2, si3) with a mark/space ratio of less than 1:1, and a common interrogating circuit (18) for all keys, which activates a current switch (19) connecting all control and detection circuits (15, 25, 35) to one terminal (SN) of an operating voltage source.

<CLAIMS>
An optoelectronic, finger-operated keyboard for use 
in industrial measurement equipment, comprising 


at least two keys for generating one associated 
operation signal (n1, n2, n3) each, 
an infrared-transmitting cover (1), 
one infrared emitter (3) per key which is disposed 
at the inside (12) of the cover and emits infrared 

light collimated virtually perpendicular to said 
inside, 


the infrared emitters being arranged side by side 
with a minimum spacing sufficient for individual 

operation, 
one infrared detector (4) adjacent to each infrared 
emitter which is separated from the latter 

by a shield (5) opaque to infrared, and which 
is pointed at the cover, 


said infrared detector (4) being located within 
the main radiation range of the infrared light 

emitted by the associated infrared emitter and 
diffusely scattered at a finger (2), but outside 

the infrared light reflected from the outside 
and/or inside of the cover, and 
an operating circuit (8) comprising: 

a respective electronic switch (16, 26, 36) 
for and in series with each infrared emitter 

(13, 23, 33),  
 
a separate control and detection circuit (15, 
25, 35) for each key 


which generates current control pulses (si1, 
si2, si3) with a mark/space ratio less than 1:1 for 

controlling the respective electronic switch 
and thus for feeding the respective infrared 

emitter (13, 23, 33), 

the frequencies of the current control pulses 
of the individual control and detection circuits 

being of the same order of magnitude, 
the control and detection circuit (15, 25, 35) 
further providing a binary signal (bs1, bs2, 

bs3) one level (L) of which is assigned to 
nonoperation by the finger (2) and the other 

level (H) of which occurs after a detection 
time (dt) following an operation, and 
a scanning circuit (18) common to all keys 

which generates periodic time-window pulses 
(zf) 


whose mark/space ratio is less than 1:1, 
whose duration is longer than the detection 
time (dt), and 
which switch a current switch (19) connecting 
all control and detection circuits (15, 25, 

35) to one terminal (SN) of a supply-voltage 
source into a conducting state, 
said scanning circuit (18) generating a sampling 
signal (s) which is equal in frequency 

to the time-window pulses (zf), and 

with which the respective operation signal 
(n1, n2, n3) is formed from a level (H, L) of 

the respective binary signal (bs1, bs2, bs3) 
which is present within each time-window 

pulse (zf) after the detection time (dt). 
An optoelectronic, finger-operated keyboard as 
claimed in claim 1, with a mark/space ratio of the time-window 

pulses (zf) of 1:10 at the most. 
An optoelectronic, finger-operated keyboard as 
claimed in claim 1, with a mark/space ratio of the 

current control pulses (si..) of 1:10 at the most. 
An optoelectronic, finger-operated keyboard as 
claimed in claim 1, with three keys.
