<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel resin composition
to be suitably used for sealing liquid crystal displays of
a variety of types developed in recent years and to be
reliably operated in severe environments. It also relates
to a film-made liquid crystal cell realized by using such
a resin composition.In recent years, liquid crystal displays have become
markedly popular in response to the rapid development of
down-sized personal computers, audio equipment,
instruments, color television sets and other electronic
appliances. A liquid crystal display consumes less energy
and requires less drive force than a catnode ray tube (CRT)
so that it allows reductions of size, weight and cost, while
it can produce clear and sharp images better than a CRT
even in the sunlight. Because of these advantages, the
scope of application of liquid crystal display (hereinafter
referred to as LCD) has been constantly expanding.
Particularly, tremendous efforts have been paid to develop
LCDs comprising a film substrate that are thin and 
lightweight and not damaged even if carried in a pocket of
a jacket. As known glass-made LCDs, film-made LCDs are
required to have outstanding physical properties. For
instance, the components of the cell of the LCD need to be
firmly bonded together to provide an enhanced degree of
hermeticity. Therefore, they must be physically and
chemically stable and resistant against moisture and heat.Currently, a cell comprising glass substrates and
liquid crystal is prepared typically by bonding upper and
lower substrates by means of a one-liquid hot-cure type
epoxy adhesive, injecting liquid crystal in a highly vacuum
condition and sealing the remaining hole by means of a UV
(ultraviolet)-light-cure type or two-liquid cold-cure type
resin. Improved and highly efficient one-liquid hot-cure
type adhesives are currently available and, therefore,
there are practically no technological troubles for bonding
glass substrates.On the other hand, one-liquid hot-cure type or
two-liquid type epoxy adhesive are used for bonding film
substrates. However, a one-liquid hot-cure type epoxy
adhesive is originally designed to bond glass substrates
and, once cured, it becomes so hard that it is scarcely
capable of withstanding bending force and adapting itself
to thermal deformations of the bonded substrates and it is 
rather poorly adhesive to the substrates. A two-liquid
type epoxy adhesive is disadvantageous in that it has a
relatively short pot life and does not have satisfactory
physical and chemical stability to the
