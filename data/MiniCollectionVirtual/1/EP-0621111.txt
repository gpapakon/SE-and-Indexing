<ABSTRACT>
A hydropneumatically controlled multiaxis manipulator 
of anthropomorphous type; the manipulator comprises 

a rotatable table (11) provided with an articulated 
arm (13), wherein each rotational axis (12, 15, 17) 

is connected to a hydropneumatic drive assembly (25, 
28) comprising at least one active pneumatic actuator 

unit (25) and a passive hydraulic actuator unit (28) 
operatively connected one to the other, and wherein 

the passive hydraulic unit (28) is connected to a 
closed circuit comprising flow-control valve means 

(41, 42) pneumatically actuated; a signal generator 
(33) is related to the active pneumatic unit (25) to 

supply correlated speed and position signals, which 
are feedback to a control system comprising a 

programmable process unit (CP), and an electropneumatic 
control unit for the actuators (25, 28) 

comprising a set of solenoid valves (39, 40, 43, 44, 
48) which are selectively actuated by a programmed 

sequence of control signals emitted by the process 
unit (CP), to selectively activate the actuators 

(25, 28) of the manipulator as a function of a 
programmed sequence of movements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiaxis 
anthropomorphous manipulator provided with fluid 
actuated control means for reference coordinates of 
polar and/or cylindrical type, comprising a base, a 
rotary support table for an articulated arm provided 
with a gripping device at one end; drive means are 
provided for rotating the support table and for 
moving the articulated arm between angularly and/or 
axially spaced positions, and for actuating the 
gripping member respectively as a function of 
programmed and preselected sets of movements of the 
manipulator. Anthropomorphous manipulators are known which make 
use of electromechanical and/or hydraulic drive 
means, integrated with electronic systems for 
controlling the movements. The use of 
electromechanical and/or hydraulic drive means in 
presently known manipulators intended for handling 
relatively high weights, for example of the order of 
a few tens of kilograms, has considerable working 
limits in terms of reliability due to the extreme  
 
complexity of the manipulator, and in terms of 
weight-power ratio, which have limited the use of 
these manipulators, also in view of the high 
manufacturing and running costs of the manipulator 
itself. Manipulators which make use of hydraulic control 
systems require large masses of oil in circulation 
and heavy armored tubes developping outside and along 
the articulated arm of the manipulator. Moreover, the 
use of hydraulic drive systems does not enable high 
working speeds and satisfactory working accelerations 
to be achieved, except by excessively increasing the 
mass of oil in circulation and the power of the feed 
pumps. This leads to excessive weight and high costs 
of the manipulator. Electromechanical drive systems suffer substantially 
from the same disadvantages in that they require 
electric motors of adequate power, thus becoming 
bulky and high in weight in relation to the weight of 
manipulated pieces. Pneumatic actuators or combined hydropneumatic drive 
systems which use pressurised air as an energy source  
 
are also known, due to the wide availability of the 
pressurised air in any work environment and to the 
possibility of achieving working accelerations and 
speeds which are greatly superior to those of 
conventional hydraulic drive systems. Nevertheless, pneumatic actuators are difficult to 
use in drives which require a precise control of 
movements, due to the compressibility of the air, and 
to the need to use conventional control systems which 
are substantially linked
