<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a master alloy, particularly for use in making beta
Titanium-molybdenum alloys, and methods of making of such master alloys.Titanium-containing alloys find a broad range of applications in areas where low weight
and strength are required, such as aerospace and military uses, as well as corrosion resistance
and heat applications, including use in turbine blades ; engine parts, high speed cutting tools, and
so on. Molybdenum is known to be difficult to diffuse uniformly in titanium, because of its
higher melting point and higher density, which causes molybdenum-rich particles to drop to the
bottom of a molten titanium pool where they sinter into agglomerates and form inclusions in the
ingot produced. See,e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,508,910. The same problems of getting
molybdenum to homogenize with titanium are also experienced with niobium, which like
molybdenum, is also highly refractory.Matters are further complicated in that titanium alloys require relatively tight chemistries,
and often the chemistry of the desired master alloy is poorly compatible with the homogenous
alloying of the various components, due to differences in component solubility, melting point,
density, etc. Furthermore, the chemistry of the alloy is frequently dictated by the alloying
process used.A master alloy comprising 35-40% Mo, at least about 30% Al, 1-5% Ti
and 15-25% Zr and devoid of Nb, which alloy is made by a method
comprising aluminothermic reaction of oxides of Ti, Mo and Zr with Al metal
is disclosed in US-A-4 104 059.An object of the invention is to provide niobium molybdenum/titanium alloys
which may be readily formulated to be substantially free of niobium inclusions.Another object of the invention is to produce an alloy having relatively low
aluminum. According to the present invention, a process for
preparing a master alloy is provided as defined in claim 5.A thermite for use in preparing a Ti master
alloy having low aluminum is produced, the master alloy comprising a predominant amount
of Mo, and lesser amounts of Nb, Al, Si, O2, C, N2, and Ti. The master alloy of the
invention (Claim 1) comprises 55-75% Mo, 6-16% Nb, 1-15% Al, 0.1-5% Si, 0-1% O2, 0-1%
C. 0-1% N2 and balance Ti. Another master
alloy (Claim 3) comprises 55-65% Mo, 6-16% Nb, 5-15% Al, 0.1-5% Si, 0-1% O2, 0-1% C,
0-1% N2 and balance Ti.A master alloy is an alloy of selected elements that can be added to a charge of metal
to provide a desired composition or texture or to deoxidize one or more component of the
mixture.An
