<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polybutylene 
terephthalates having a content of terminal COOH groups of 

less than 30 meq/kg and a number-averaged molecular weight of 
at least 30,000 and to polymer mixtures comprising such a 

polybutylene terephthalate. 
The polybutylene terephthalate according to the 
invention and the polymer mixtures comprising the said 

polybutylene terephthalate have a good lacquer bonding.

<DESCRIPTION>
Polybutylene terephthtalates (PBT)
are suitable, inter alia, for motor-car parts, for example, bumpers, due to the good mechanical properties and
the resistance to organic solvents. However, the said materials show inadequacies as regards the bonding for lacquers,
both lacquer systems on a water basis and lacquer systems based on organic solvents.The invention relates to articles formed from a polybutylene terephthalate having a content of terminal COOH
groups of less than 30 meq/kg and a number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of at least 30,000, determined with
respect to polystyrene as a standard and comprising one or more layers of a lacquer coating.It is known to the Applicants that a polybutlene terephthalate having a content of terminal COOHG groups of 30
meg/kg and a number-averaged molecular weight Mn of 26,000 is commercially available. However, as far as is known,
articles which are provided with a lacquer layer are not formed from this material. EP A 0 378 884 describes polybutylene
terephthalates with an I.V. of more than 0.80 dl/g and with carboxyl end group contents between 7 and 23 meg/g.It has been found that polybutylene terephthalate having a content of terminal COOH groups and a Mn value as
mentioned hereinbefore,
shows an excellent bonding for lacquer. This applies both to lacquer systems on a water basis and to lacquer
systems on the basis of an organic solvent, while in addition other properties, for example, the mechanical properties,
are excellent.The Mn value is preferably at least 35,000 and the content of terminal COOH groups is preferably less than 25
meq/kg. Generally, the smaller the content of terminal COOH groups, the better the lacquer bonding proves to be.Polybutylene terephthalate is derived from butane-1,4-diol and terephtalic acid. It is possible to use in the polymer
mixtures copolyesters in which a part of the diol compound and/or a part of the terephtalic acid is replaced by another
diol and/or carbolic acid. For the polymer mixtures according to the invention it is recommendable to use a polybutylene
terephthalate which is built up for more than 70 mol.% from units derived from butane-1,4-diol and terephthalic acid.
Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) is to be understood to mean in this Patent Application both a homopolyester and
copolyester. It is also possible to use for example, a glycol having three or more hydroxyl groups or a trivalent or
polyvalent carboxylic acid has been incorporated. For the preparation of the PBT materials according to the invention which
