<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling cell cycle progression including into a cell to be controlled during the interphase portion of the cell cycle regulating composition. The composition is selected from the group consisting of a protein and a fragment of the protein to alter the cell cycle progression of the cell while maintaining the viability of the cell. The protein fragments have been found to have the unexpected and surprising characteristic of being soluble in low concentrations of glycerol, thereby enhancing their value in pharmaceutical applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the control of
cell cycle progression and it more particularly relates to
compositions and methods for regulating cell cycle
progression to suppress tumorigenesis. It is well recognized that in the development of higher
organisms, such as animals and humans, orderly cell cycle
progression is a critical factor. Because of such
progression, ordered and systematic cell differentiation
occurs so that, ultimately from a single undifferentiated
cell, a highly structured organism, having a variety of
specialized tissues, develops. In general, physiologically
normal cell cycle progression is very important to the
organism, not only during the stages of early growth, but
throughout the entire life of the organism. Thus, even
after the organism has reached maturity, normal cycle
progression is still a very important aspect of health.
This, for example, can be clearly seen in the importance of
proper cellular regulation in the blood forming and
reproductive organs.Under certain circumstances, normal cell cycle
progression fails, often with catastrophic effects for the
organism. Such a failure is seen, for example, in the
various forms of cancer where, because of an unchecked, and
uncontrolled, progression of cells through the cell cycle,
from the completion of mitosis through interphase and back
into mitosis, tumorigenesis becomes, in many cases, a life
threatening event. Thus, a restraint on uncontrolled cell
cycle progression is sometimes attempted in an effort to
treat or control the tumorigenic condition.Under current conditions, where tumorigenesis has
developed, drastic treatment measures, such as radiation
therapy and chemotherapy are employed. Both of these 
modalities are very expensive and, in some cases, very
damaging to the organism. Chemotherapy, for example, can
cause the death of the patient and when chemotherapy is
successful in controlling tumorigenesis, it may have long
ten adverse effects on the body. Such an adverse effect
may result in premature heart problems for the patient.
Thus, while conventional therapeutic methods, such as
radiation and chemotherapy, serve a useful purpose in
destroying certain uncontrolled cells, they also produce the
unwanted effects of destroying useful cells and weakening
organ systems.In view of the foregoing, it would be highly desirable
to have techniques and compositions for regulating unwanted
cell progression, such as in tumorigenesis, while
maintaining cell viability. In addition, it would be
further very highly desirable
