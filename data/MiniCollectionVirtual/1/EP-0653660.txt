<ABSTRACT>
An optical isolator includes first and second groups (10.1, 10.2) of 
optical elements arranged in tandem on a common axis (13). The two groups are 

mirror images of one another. In one embodiment, each group comprises a non-reciprocal 
rotator slab (12.1, 12.2) positioned between a pair of birefringent wedges 

(14.1, 16.1; 14.2, 16.2). The design is capable of exhibiting zero net walk-off 
between the input and output beams, zero relative walk-off between the ordinary and 

extraordinary beams, or both.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical isolator designed to reduce 
the displacement between both the ordinary and extraordinary rays at the isolator 
output (relative walk-off) and/or between the input and output beams of the isolator 
(net walk-off). Reflections in optical systems often generate noise and optical feedback 
which may degrade the performance of various system components, particularly 
signal sources such as semiconductor lasers and fiber amplifiers. Therefore, the 
ability to optically isolate lasers and other sensitive components from these 
reflections is often critical to the performance of the system. In general, a 
conventional optical isolator comprises a non-reciprocal rotator (e.g., 45° Faraday 
rotator encased within a bias magnet) disposed between a pair of polarization 
selectors (e.g., linear polarizers, birefringent plates, or birefringent wedges). Input 
signals passing through the isolator in the transmitting, forward direction are 
essentially fully coupled through the polarization selector and Faraday rotator to the 
output device (e.g., fiber). However, the polarization of reflected signals passing 
through the isolator in the reflecting, reverse direction is rotated such that essentially 
none of the reflections are coupled back into the signal source. A common isolator design includes a Faraday rotator slab sandwiched 
between a pair of birefringent wedges. See, for example, W. Emkey et al., Proc.OFC, Abstract THF2 (1989). Under certain conditions, this design is effective in 
reducing the polarization dependence of the isolator. However, the input and output 
beams of such an isolator are displaced from another, a phenomenon called netwalk-off. Because the input and output beams are not coaxial, the mechanical/optical 
design of the isolator is complicated and its cost of manufacture increased. In addition, this design exhibits a phenomenon called relative walk-off. 
That is, the input signal splits into ordinary and extraordinary rays which are 
displaced from one another at the isolator output. When the output is lensed into an 
aperture (e.g., a fiber core), the power coupled into the fiber from each ray can be 
different, and the total coupled power is less than that possible if the relative walk-off 
did not occur. A need remains, therefore, for an optical isolator which has the 
capability for zero relative walk-off (i.e., coaxial ordinary and extraordinary rays) 
and/or zero net walk-off (i.e., coaxial input and output beams).  An optical isolator
