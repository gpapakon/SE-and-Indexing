<ABSTRACT>
A radiographic camera has a housing which enclosed a tube 
with a radiographic source. The conduit is coupled to a 

locking assembly at the back end of the camera and to a 
connector at the front end of the camera. A plug assembly is 

coupled in the connector mechanism. The connector has a 
movable shield which selectively blocks the conduit from the 

exterior of the housing when the plug assembly is partially 
removed, and unblocks the conduit when the plug assembly is 

removed and when a guide cable is being attached. The shield 
is mounted on a slide which also has a connection to a switch 

on the back of the camera. The switch is actuable when the 
shield is not blocking the conduit. The switch allows 

control cables to be connected to the locking assembly and 
can be actuated after the guide cable is attached.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector assembly for a
radiographic camera.An X-ray machine can be used to make photographic images
which indicate the internal composition of objects. One well
known use is the detection of broken or fracture bones. A
typical X-ray machine is inadequate for some tasks because it
is unable to make photographic images of metals. Since a
typical X-ray machine is large and requires a power source, it
cannot be taken to remote locations without significant expense.Radiographic cameras are used to make images similar to
X-ray images, but with greater flexibility. A radiographic
camera can record images of metals which cannot be imaged with
an X-ray machine. In addition these cameras are portable and
operate without an external power source, and so can take
images of objects in their natural environment. Radiographic
cameras are used extensively in the oil industry, for example,
to check for flaws in metal pipelines which could otherwise
cause oil spills.A typical radiographic camera and source are shown and
described in EP-A-0 467 105 and US-A-4,827,493,
respectively. Each of these patents is assigned to the same
assignee as the present invention.
Document EP-A-0 012 005 discloses a radiographic apparatus having a storage unit, manipulating means and a shutter mounted on the storage unit for sliding movement.
As shown in FIG. 1 of EP-A-0 467 105,
an S-shaped tubing extends from a back end of
the camera to a front end. The tubing is surrounded by a
radiation shield and encloses a radiographic source at the
end of a source cable. A typical radiographic source
includes stacked iridium-192 wafers which are welded inside a
capsule. Since the radiographic source emits radiation in a 
line, when the source is in a stored position (as in FIG. 1),
only minimal radiation is reflected toward the front end, by
which time any power that remains is significantly decreased.A lock assembly is provided over an opening at the back
end of the camera, and a threaded nut blocks an opening at
the front end. Control cables are attached to the back end,
and a guide cable is screwed to the front end. The lock
assembly in the back prevents the radiation source from being
pushed out of the front end without first using a key to
unlock the camera, and then connecting a control cable. At
the front end of a typical camera, a technician removes the
threaded nut, and attaches a guide cable with a threaded end
over the threaded mount on the housing. When the control
cables and guide cable are positioned, the

<CLAIMS>
A radiographic camera (10) having a housing (12)
enclosing a radiographic source (14) in a tubular conduit

(23), the housing (12) having a front end (24) with a
first opening (43) and a back end (22) with a second

opening, a pathway being formed between the source (14)
and the first opening (43), the camera (10) further

having a locking assembly (20) coupled to the back end
(22) that releases to receive a control cable, and a

connector assembly (40) coupled to the front end (24) for
receiving a guide cable (64), a removable plug assembly

(26) being inserted in the first opening (43),
characterized in that it comprises:


an actuable switch (80) coupled to the locking
assembly (20), the locking assembly (20) having means

(82,84) such that an actuation of the actuable switch
(80) enables an unlocking of the locking assembly (20) to

allow the locking assembly (20) to receive the control
cable, and
a movable slide (52) coupled to the connector
assembly (40) for blocking said pathway and through means

(74,76) coupled to the actuable switch (80), for moving
between a first posi
tion in which activation of the
actuable switch (80) is disabled and a second position in

which activation of the actuable switch (80) is enabled.
The camera of claim 1, wherein the slide (52)
includes a shield (54) that in the first position of the

movable slide (52) is disposed in the pathway and in the
second position of the movable slide (52) is not disposed

in the pathway.
The camera of claim 2, wherein the shield (54) is a
tungsten shield (54).
The camera of claim 2, further comprising a guide
(36) having walls (36a, 36b, 36c) which define a channel,

wherein the guide is rigidly connected to the conduit
(23), and wherein the movable slide (52) moves within the

channel.
The camera of any of claims 1-4, wherein the plug
assembly (26) has a cable (32) which extends into the

conduit (23) to a position at or near the source (14).
The camera of any of claims 1-5, wherein the conduit
(23) with the radiographic source (14) is S-shaped.
A method for operating a radiographic camera (10)
having a housing (12) enclosing a radiographic source

(14) in a tubular conduit (23), the housing (12) having 
a front end (24) with a first opening (43) and a back end

(22) with a second opening, the camera (10) further
having a locking assembly (20) coupled to the back end

(22) for receiving a control cable, and a connector
assembly (40) coupled to the front end (24) for receiving

a guide cable (64), a plug assembly (26) being inserted
in the first opening (43), and an actuable switch (80)

coupled to the locking assembly (20), wherein the
actuable switch (80) enables and disables the ability of

the locking assembly (20) to receive the control cable,
comprising the steps of:


moving a shield (54) in the front end (24)

removing the plug assembly (26);
attaching the guide cable (64) to the connector
assembly (40);
removing the shield (54) from intermediate the
guide cable (64) and the source (14) so that there is a

pathway for the source (14) to enter the guide cable
(64),

characterized in that it comprises the step of actuating
the actuable switch (80) to be in an enabled position to

allow the locking assembly (20) to receive the control
cable after the shield (54) has been removed from

intermediate the source (14) and the plug assembly (26).
