<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multicylinder internal combustion engine with two inlet valves and two outlet valves (12, 11), the outlet valves (11) being located on one side of an internal combustion engine and the inlet valves (12) being located on the other side. The outlet valves (11) and the inlet valves (12) are actuated by a camshaft via inlet rocker arms (4) and outlet rocker arms (5). In order to reduce the size of the cylinder heads (1) and the rocker housing (2), the inlet rocker arm (4) and the outlet rocker arm (5) are forked. Each forked rocker arm (4, 5) actuates two similar valves (12, 11) per cylinder (13). The axes (4a, 5a) of the inlet rocker arms (4) or outlet rocker arms (5) are staggered in relation to each other or preferably overlap.

and exhaust rocker arms (5), both the intake rocker

arms (4) and the exhaust rocker arms (5) being embodied
as forked rocker arms, in each case one forked rocker

arm (4, 5) actuating two valves (12, 11) of the same
kind per cylinder (13), the axes (4a, 5a) of the intake

rocker arms (4) and the exhaust rocker arms (5),
respectively, being offset relative to one another and

arranged one above the other, and the exhaust rocker
arms (11) of all the cylinders (3) of a bank of

cylinders being mounted on a continuous shaft (8),
