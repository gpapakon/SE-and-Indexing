<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a three-dimensional 
thermoplastic polymeric layer as substrate material for the 
biofilm in a biofilm reactor and to a biofilm reactor 
containing the said polymeric layer as substrate material 
for the biofilm. The substrate material and the biofilm 
reactor according to the invention are particularly 
suitable for use in a system for the treatment of aqueous 
effluents which contain organic waste. The present 
invention furthermore relates to a process for the 
purification of an aqueous effluent containing organic 
waste by the said biofilm reactor. It is well known since several decades that aqueous 
effluents containing organic materials (hereinafter waste 
waters) can be purified to a certain extent by the action 
of micro-organisms. Many micro-organisms, indeed, are 
capable of degrading, under aerobic and/or anaerobic 
conditions, organic compounds and organic materials, 
(collectively termed herein organic waste) and, in this 
manner, to remove organic waste from or reduce its 
concentration in waste waters. Under aerobic conditions, 
organic carbon (i.e. carbon comprised in an organic 
compound) is biologically degraded yielding energy used by 
the micro-organisms for their metabolic functions, carbon 
dioxide, water and biomass material, whereas organic 
nitrogen (i.e. nitrogen comprised in an organic compound) 
is biologically transformed by a nitrification process via 
ammonia into nitrate and energy, which nitrate can, by a 
biologically denitrification process, be further 
transformed into molecular nitrogen.  Based on the degrading action of micro-organisms, many 
systems for the treatment of waste waters, have been 
developed (the terms treatment and purification are used 
interchangeably hereinafter). Some of these purification 
systems, particularly systems for the treatment of sewage, 
are in use at large scale for many years. The term 
"sewage" herein refers in particular to domestic waste 
waters and to aqueous discharges containing organic waste 
which can be biologically decomposed similarly easily. In 
these purification systems the micro-organisms are commonly 
present in the form of a so-called "biomass". Such biomass 
is composed of one species or - commonly - of multiple 
species of micro-organisms and extracellular products such 
as exopolysaccharides produced by the micro-organisms. A 
biomass typically includes micro-organisms such as 
bacteria, fungi, protozoa and algae. It may further 
contain higher organisms such as snails, worms,
