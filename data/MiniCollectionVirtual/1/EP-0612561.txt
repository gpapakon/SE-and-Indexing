<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of solid particles of catalysts or of adsorbents, which consists in causing the said particles to rise in at least one vibrating helical spiral turn comprising at least two steps, the said particles being subjected to a temperature profile over the major part of the trajectory in the said turn, and the said particles being brought into contact with at least one fluid over at least a part of the trajectory, the said process being characterised by the heating of at least one step of the turn by the Joule effect to a temperature of between 20 and 1000@C. The invention also relates to the apparatus for making use of the said process.
