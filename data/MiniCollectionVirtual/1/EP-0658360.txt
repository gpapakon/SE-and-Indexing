<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an intermediate (interface) device between a ski and the bindings for holding a boot on the ski. The device comprises two stops (14, 15) intended to be connected to the ski, towards the front and the rear of the central part of the base of the ski, respectively, and a linking leg (18, 52) forming a stiffener between the two stops. The linking leg comprises at least two levers (20, 10, 54, 53), connected by at least one link forming a central articulation. One of the bearing plates of the boot is movable vertically and transmits the vertical stresses from the boot to one of the levers, and an elastic return means (40, 60) exerts, on one of the levers (10, 53), an upward return force of sufficient intensity to hold the central articulation of the two levers suspended in the presence of the boot. The link between the levers can preferably be disengaged.

Interface device provided to be assembled to a ski, especially an alpine ski,
and to be associated wig two binding elements adapted to retain the front end and rear end

of a boot sole, including:

two stops (14, 15) adapted to be affixedly connected to the ski toward the front and
rear, respectively, of the central portion of the ski;
a linking leg (18, 52) provided to form, when the boot is present, a stiffener
between the two stops, each end of which is connected to a stop (14, 15) by a pivotal

connection about a transverse axis raised relative to the upper surface of the ski when the
stops are affixed to the ski;

   the linking leg having at least two levers (20, 10, 54, 53), a front lever (20, 54) and
a rear lever (10, 53), which are provided to be raised relative to the upper surface of the ski,

when the stops are affixed to the ski and in the presence of the boot, substantially in the
extension of one another, and are joined by at least one intermediate linkage when the boot

is present;

   and an elastic return means (40, 60) exerting an upward return force on one of the
levers (10, 53),

   characterized in that the intermediate linkage is a support linkage provided to
transmit the forces from one lever to the other along a longitudinal direction, when the levers

are approximately aligned, and that it is provided to enable a relative angular movement with
limited angle between the two levers (20, 10, 54, 53), that the elastic return means (40, 60)

a provided to ensure the suspension of the intermediate linkage above the ski when the stops

are affixed to the ski, and when the boot is present.
Interface device according to claim 1, characterized in that one (20, 54) of the
levers has, in the vicinity of the linkage, between the two levers, a support element to support

one end of the boot. 
Device wording to claim 1, characterized in that the elastic return means
(40, 60) is a compressible element located between one of the levers (10, 53) and the ski,

pressing upward against the lever in proximity with the linkage to the other lever, and
downward against the upper surface of the ski, and that the compressible element is located

in the vicinity of said movable support element (13).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the elastic return means
(40, 60) is an elastically deformable block of shock absorbing material.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the linkage between the two
levers (20, 10, 54, 53) is disengageable.
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that an auxiliary return means
(43, 47, 55, 57) exerts an upward elastic return moment on one (20, 54) of the levers, called

the movable lever.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the auxiliary return means
is a lifting arm (43, 55) that is actuated by a return spring (57, 47), taking support against the

movable lever.
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the lifting arm (43, 55) is
journaled at its base, and that it is extended beyond its pivotal connection by two spades (49,

50) spaced apart by a distance greater than the width of the ski, in such a way as to form the
braking spades of the ski.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the rear end of the front
lever (20) has a vertical stop (44) and a longitudinal stop (45) that are capable of cooperating

by nesting with corresponding stops (46, 47) of the rear lever (10) to form the linking leg.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the linking leg (52)
includes a front lever (54) connected to the ski by a pivotal connection at its front end, a rear

lever (53) connected to the ski by a pivotal connection at its rear end, and an intermediate
lever (55), that the rear lever (53) and the intermediate lever (55) are joined by a pivotal

connection about a transverse axis, that the front lever (54) and the intermediate lever (55)
are connected to one another by a support along a longitudinal direction, and that the front 

lever is fended rearwardly, beyond its support on the intermediate lever, by a runner (56)
that is supported along a vertical direction against the end of the rear lever, and which

is adapted to support the rear end of the boot.
