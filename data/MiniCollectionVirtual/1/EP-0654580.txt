<ABSTRACT>
The rock drill has a drill head (2) made on the whole of carbide and connected to a drill shank (1). The cross-section of the drill head (2) is of essentially rectangular design, cutting edges which serve to remove the rock being arranged on each of the diagonals (D1, D2). The cutting edges are composed of a main cutting edge (4) and two auxiliary cutting edges (5, 6), the main cutting edge (4) and the auxiliary cutting edges (5, 6) essentially having the same envelope curve.

<CLAIMS>
Rock drill comprising a drillhead (2, 12, 22, 32), which is 
made entirely of a hard metal and connecte
d to a 
drillshaft (1) with clamping grooves (11), 
characterised 
in that
 the cross-section of the drillhead (2, 12, 22, 32), 
positioned between the end (10, 16, 28, 37) which is 

connected to the drillshaft (1) and the free end, is 
established by the remaining cross-section between two 

cutouts (3a, 3b), which are essentially circular-sectional 
and extend diametrically opposite and along the drill axis 

in the longitudinal direction of the drillhead (2, 12, 22, 
32) and serve to pass drill waste, whilst projections as 

seen in the axial direction of the cutouts (3a, 3b) coincide 
with an area of the clamping grooves (11) which are 

adjacent the end (10, 16, 28, 37) which is connected to 
the drillshaft (1) and with a main cutting edge (4, 14, 24, 

34)s which extends essentially roofshaped and along one 
of the diagonals (D1) of the cross-section. 
Rock drill according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
for the second diagonal (D2) are provided at least two 

essentially parallel thereto extending additional cutters (5, 
6, 15, 25, 35). 
Rock drill according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 
the additional cutters (5, 6, 15, 25, 35) are arranged 

rotation-symmetrically in the outer end area of the 
drillhead (2, 12, 22, 32). 
Rock drill according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the main cutter (4, 14, 24, 34) 
engages a rock to be processed in the rotary direction of 

the drillhead (2, 12, 22, 32) ahead of the additional cutters 
(5, 6, 15, 25, 35). 
Rock drill according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 the main cutter (4, 14, 24, 34) and  
 

the additional cutters (5, 6, 15, 25, 35) are essentially 
positioned on the same sleeve curve. 
Rock drill according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 the cross-sectional surface of the 
cutouts (3a, 3b) equals between 0.6 and 0.9 times the 

cross-section of the drillhead (2, 12, 22, 32). 
Rock drill according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the end (37) of the drillhead (32) 
which is connected to the drillshaft is of plane design. 
Rock drill according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the end (10, 16, 28) of the 
drillhead (2, 12, 22) which is connected to the drillshaft 

(1) comprises a recess (8, 17, 27), which co-operates with 
a respectively shaped end of the drillshaft (1) and which 

comprise at least two casing lines which narrow from the 
mouth area to a common centre located on the 

longitudinal axis of the drillhead (2, 12, 22). 
Rock drill according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 
the recess is conical, roof- or calotteshaped 
Rock drill according to one of the Claims, 
characterised 
in that
 the end (10) of the drillhead (2) which is 
connected to the drillhead (1) comprises rotary pickup 

surfaces (7).
