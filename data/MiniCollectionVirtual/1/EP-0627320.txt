cassette which is detachably loaded on the tape printer and has 

a cassette housing is provided. A printer frame (3) having a 
tape outlet (23) in a side frame portion is provided. Furtheron 

printing means (83,75; 142,154; 341,347) for printing the image 
on the tape at a printing position defined in the tape cassette 

are provided. The tape printer further comprises feeding means 
(101,69; 145,155; 227,349) for feeding a tape portion printed by 

said printing means through the tape outlet toward the outside 
of the cassette housing. Furtheron cutter means (49,51; 159,160; 

353a,353) are provided which include a cutter element (49,51; 

159,160; 353a,353) disposed in the tape printer in an area 
defined between the cassette housing (90, 136, 202) and the tape 

outlet of the printer frame in a state that the cassette (35, 
135, 201) is loaded on the tape printer. The tape printer 

further comprises cutter operating means (43,45; 351) for

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tape printer for printing an image 
on a tape located in a tape cassette which is detachably loaded 
on the tape printer and has a cassette housing, the tape printer 
comprising a printer frame having a tape outlet in a side frame 
portion, printing means for printing the image on the tape at a 
printing position defined in the tape cassette, feeding means 
for feeding a tape portion printed by said printing means  
 
through the tape outlet towards the outside of a cassette 
housing, cutter means for cutting the tape portion to separate 
it from the tape located in the tape cassette, and cutter 
operating means for causing the cutting operation of said cutter 
means. A tape printer comprising a cutter mechanism is known from 
EP-A-0 267 890 which discloses a tape printer having a cutter 
mechanism projecting through a bottom plate into an aera where 
the tape cassette is loaded. The tape cassette is provided with 
an opening for receiving the cutter means. Such mechanism causes 
difficulties in compact design of a tape cassette and tape 
printer. It is an object of the present invention to provide a tape 
printer comprising cutter means which can be made with more 
compact design and reduced manufacturing costs. The object is solved by a tape printer according to claim 1.  
 
The housing is formed with first to third accommodation 
sections, the first and second accommodation sections 
respectively accommodating an image source tape and 
a substantially transparent image receiving tape, 
the third accommodation section accommodating an 
adhesive tape having an adhesive surface to be applied 
to the printing surface of the image receiving tape 
after printing thereon of an image. With this structure, the printing surface is 
protected by the adhesive tape, so that the printed 
image will never be damaged with rubbing of the 
printing surface while or after the produced tape 
is fed out of the tape printer. Further, it is 
arranged such that a transferred image is a mirror 
image, a durable tape may be produced, which can be 
used for general display or as a label such that the 
printing surface of a transparent image receiving 
tape is seen from the back side opposite the printing 
surface. In a preferred structure according to the 
invention, one of first and second feed roller means 
for feeding out the image receiving tape after printing 
together with the adhesive tape is disposed in the 
tape cassette, and with the loading of the tape 
cassette in the tape printer frame
