<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drying apparatus for drying a web 
of paper, as defined in the preamble of claim 1 or 2. The present invention also relates to a 
method for drying a web of paper, as defined in the preamble 
of claim 16 or 17. In the manufacture of lightweight paper grades, such as newsprint 
and fine paper, the web is dried on a series of steam-heated drying 
cylinders. The wet web is pressed directly onto the cylinders by a series of 
tensioned, permeable fabrics or felts. In a conventional double-felted, two tier dryer section, the wet web 
passes from one cylinder to the next in a generally serpentine fashion 
through long, unsupported "open draws". The majority of the water vapor 
that leaves the sheet or web is released in these open draws. Problems have been experienced during operation of conventional 
dryer sections with regard to sheet flutter during movement of the web 
through such open draws.  
 DE-C-4037661 teaches a prior art single tier drying section followed by 
a two tier section. The preamble of claims 1, 2, 16, and 17 has been 
drafted to read on the disclosure of this document. Also, in conventional dryer sections, problems are caused by 
cross-directional sheet shrinkage and inefficient ventilation of evaporated 
water. Additionally, conventional drying sections of the aforementioned type 
typically require threading ropes in order to thread a tail of the web through 
such dryer sections. Some of the problems with sheet flutter, sheet shrinkage, and vapor 
ventilation have been solved by extending the length of the single tier, top 
felted sections known in the art as "BelRun" sections, to include more of 
the drying cylinders. BelRun is a common law mark of Beloit Corporation. 
However, the primary concern with extending the number of top felted 
sections so far down the length of the dryer section is that an imbalance in 
drying on each side of the web was expected to cause a problem with 
sheet curl. Typically, with the aforementioned arrangement, approximately 41 
percent of the dryers are disposed in a single tier configuration, and the 
remaining 59 percent are arranged as two tier, double felted dryers. The problems associated with the conventional two tier dryer 
sections and the extended "BelRun" dryer sections have been solved with 
the use of the so-called "Bel-Champ" dryer section. Bel-Champ is a 
common law trademark of Beloit Corporation. The Bel-Champ™ dryer 
section utilizes a series of single tier dryer sections, generally disposed 
horizontally,
