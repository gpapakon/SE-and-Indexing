<ABSTRACT>
In the head, a bias 
conductor and a magnetoresistive magnetic sensing section (6) are 

electrically connected to each other in series. Further, the 
bias conductor (7) is formed in such a pattern as to have a width 

and distance from a magnetic recording medium facing surface (1) 
which become larger as it is away from a portion transversing the 

magnetoresistive magnetic sensing section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetoresistance thin film 
magnetic head which is suitable for reproducing signals recorded 
in a hard disc and to a bias characteristics measuring method 
therefor. For a reproducing head of a hard disc drive or a driving 
device, a magnetoresistance thin film magnetic head exhibiting 
high sensitivity to shorter wavelength, hereinafter referred to 
as an MR head, is employed in general. The MR head is a reproducing head utilizing a phenomenon of 
magnetoresistance effect in which electrical resistance varies 
in accordance with an angle formed by the direction of 
magnetization with the direction of an internal current. In the 
MR head, an MR magnetic thin film receives a leakage magnetic 
flux from a magnetic recording medium, having its direction of 
magnetization turned by the magnetic flux. The direction of 
magnetization forms an angle corresponding to the magnetic 
property with the direction of the current running through the 
inside of the MR magnetic thin film. Therefore, the electrical 
resistance of the MR magnetic thin film changes, and a change in  
 
voltage corresponding to the change in the electrical resistance 
appears at electrodes at both ends of the MR magnetic thin film. 
Thus, the magnetically recorded signals can be read out as 
voltage signals. The MR head, if used as the reproducing head of the hard 
disc drive, has a shielding construction in which a 
magnetoresistance effect magnetic sensing section 54 and a bias 
conductor 55 are sandwiched between a pair of magnetically 
shielding thin film magnetic cores 56, 57 via an insulating layer 
58, as shown in Figs.1 and 2. The magnetoresistance effect 
magnetic sensing section 54, hereinafter referred to as an MR 
magnetic sensing section, consists of a magnetoresistance effect 
thin film formed by stacking electrodes 52, 53 on a distal end 
and a rear end, respectively, of an air bearing surface (ABS) 51, 
that is, a surface facing the hard disc, while the bias conductor 
55 provides a magnetized status in a predetermined direction for 
the MR magnetic sensing section 54. The MR head of the above 
construction is loaded to be used on a slider member 59 of Al2O3 
- TiC or the like. In the MR head of such construction, for reproduction of 
signals, direct currents are supplied as sense currents from the 
distal end electrode 52 and the rear end electrode 53 of the MR 
magnetic sensing section 54, while a direct current is supplied 
to the bias conductor 55 for generating a biased magnetic field.
