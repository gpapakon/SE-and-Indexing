<ABSTRACT>
Method and compositions are provided for the determination of telomere length and telomerase activity, as well as the ability to inhibit telomerase activity in the treatment of proliferative diseases. Particularly, primers are elongated under conditions which minimize interference from other genomic sequences, so as to obtain accurate determinations of telomeric length or telomerase activity. In addition, compositions are provided for intracellular inhibition of telomerase activity and means are shown for slowing the loss of telomeric repeats in aging cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THERAPY AND DIAGNOSIS OF CONDITIONS RELATED fO TELOMERE LENGTH AND/OR TELOMERASE ACTIVITYThis invention relates to methods for therapy and diagnosis of cellular senescence and immortalization. Background of the Invention The following is a general description of art relevant to the present invention. None is admitted to be prior art to the invention. Generally, this art relates to observations relating to cellular senescence, and theories or hypothesis which explain such aging and the mechanisms by which cells escape senescence and immortalize. Normal human somatic cells (e.g. , fibroblasts, endothelial, and epithelial cells) display a finite replicative capacity of 50-100 population doubling characterized by a cessation of proliferation in spite of the presence of abundant growth factors. This cessation of replication in vitro is variously referred to as cellular senescence or cellular aging, See, Goldstein, 249 Science 1129, 1990; Hayflick and Moorehead, 25 Exp. Cell Res. 585, 1961; Hayflick, ibid.. 37:614, 1985; Ohno, 11 Mech. Aging Dev. 179, 1979; Ham and McKeehan, (1979) "Media and Growth Requirements", W.B. Jacoby and I.M. Pastan (eds) , in: Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, NY, 58:44-93. The replicative life span of cells is inversely proportional to the in vivo age of the donor (Martin et al., 23 Lab. Invest. 86, 1979; Goldstein et al., 64 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 155, 1969; and Schneider and Mitsui, ibid. , 73:3584, 1976), therefore cellular senescence is suggested to play an important role in aging in vivo.Cellular immortalization (the acquisition of unlimited replicative capacity) may be thought of as an abnormal escape from cellular senescence, Shay et al. , 196 Exp. Cell Res. 33, 1991. Normal human somatic cells 

appear to be mortal, i.e. , have finite replicative potential. In contrast, the germ line and malignant tumor cells are immortal (have indefinite proliferative potential) . Human cells cultured in vitro appear to require the aid of transforming viral oncoproteins to become immortal and even then the frequency of immortalization is 10"6 to 10~7. Shay and Wright, 184 Exp. Cell Res. 109, 1989. A variety of hypotheses have been advanced over the years to explain the causes of cellular senescence. While examples of such hypotheses are provided below, there appears to be no consensus or universally accepted hypothesis.For example, the free radical theory of aging suggests that free radical-mediated damage to DNA and other macromolecules is causative in critical loss of cell
