<ABSTRACT>
- The subject of the invention is a process in which fibres (26) are placed in a mould (1, 2), the mould is closed by a flexible membrane (13) carried by a cover (6), that face of the membrane facing the fibres capable of being subjected to a vacuum and the other face to a pressure, characterised in that the membrane (13) is subjected to a vacuum, pressing the membrane against a backing (die block) (16) of the cover (6) so as to impart to the membrane local stretching deformations (29) corresponding to the hollows in the mould cavity (2), and then, with the cover in place on the mould, the following steps are carried out: the said vacuum is removed and, simultaneously, a vacuum is applied to that face of the membrane (13) facing the mould (1) and a pressure on the other face, next a resin is injected under pressure into the mould held under vacuum and then, after the mould has been filled, the latter is isolated with respect to the resin and to the vacuum and, finally, the pressure on the outer face of the membrane (13) is increased for the purpose of final compacting. - Application to articles (components) made of composite material.

Method of fabricating low-pressure injected laminated
parts, notably with deep dishes, in which there are

placed superimposed layers of fabric or sheets (26) in
a mould (1, 2), the mould is closed off by a flexible

membrane (13) carried by a cover (6) for airtight
closing of the mould, the membrane face facing the

fibres being able to be subjected to a vacuum and the
other face to a pressure, so as to press the membrane

(13) against the fibres (26) in order to inject resin
into the latter by means of the said vacuum,

characterized in that, in advance, the membrane (13),
preferably before the closure of the cover (6), is,

on its face facing the latter, subjected to a vacuum
pressing the membrane against a counter-form (16) so

as to give the membrane, at least temporarily, local
stretches (29), the sizes of which are in proportion

to the location and size of the hollows in the
moulding tool (2), and then, with the cover in place

on the mould, the following steps are performed:

the said vacuum is removed and, at the same time,
a given vacuum is applied to the face of the

membrane (13) facing the mould (1) and a pressure
of a first value is applied to the other face,
next, the resin is injected under pressure into
the mould, while the latter is kept under a

vacuum, 
then, once the mould has been filled with resin,
the mould is isolated from the resin and from the

vacuum source, and
finally, the pressure to which the external face
of the membrane (13) is subjected is brought to a

second value higher than the first, for a given
period of time, for the purpose of final

compacting.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that,
when resin is injected, the pressure exerted on the

external face of the membrane (13) is increased by a
value corresponding to the injection pressure (Pi) of

the resin.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the placing of fibres in the mould (1, 2)

consists of constructing in the moulding tool (2) a
pre-form (26) of the part to be obtained, by means of

superimposed fabrics bound together and cut to the
dimensions of the part, the edges of the mat of fabric

thus obtained being covered with cappings (24, 25).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the pre-form fabrics are flush on a level with

ducts (8, 11) for the channelling of the resin at the
edge or edges of the pre-form (26) and for the

evacuation of the resin, the said ducts and the rim
or rims of the pre-form (26) being covered by the

said cappings (24, 25). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the resin is injected in the

low part (8) of the tool (2), the resin suction
vacuum being applied in the upper part (11).
Moulding device for the implementation of the method
according to one of Claims 1 to 5, comprising a mould

body (1, 34) carrying at least one moulding tool (2,
35), and a closing cover (6, 32) with a membrane (13,

40) interposed, the mould body (1, 34) being provided
with channels (7, 36) for injecting resin in the said

tool and for suction (10, 37) and the cover (6, 32)
being provided with at least one channel (22, 33) for

communication with the outside, characterized in that
the internal wall of the cover (6, 32) is provided

with one or more counter-forms (16; 38, 39) which are
images of the tool or tools (2, 35).
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the counter-forms (16; 38, 39) are modifiable

and/or removable.
Device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in
that it includes cappings (24, 25) covering the rims

of the pre-forms (26) and any connecting ducts (8,
11) between the resin injection (7, 36) and suction

(10, 37) channels and the edges of the moulding tools
(2, 35).
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 8,
characterized in that the internal orifice of the 

said communication channel (22, 33) formed in the
cover (6, 32) is covered with a vacuum drainage fabric

(23).
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 9,
characterized in that the membrane (13, 40) is a film

approximately 50 to 75 micrometers thick and able to
stretch by around 500 to 1000%.
