<ABSTRACT>
A sheet crown control method and apparatus for use 
in endless rolling in which consecutively fed sheets are 

joined to each other to be continuously rolled through a 
rolling equipment line. The rolling equipment line 

includes a junction device for joining consecutively fed 
sheets to each other, a plurality of stands arranged in 

tandem on the downstream side of the junction device and 
having a roll bender load adjusting mechanism and a roll 

crossing mechanism. The roll cross angle of rolls 
incorporated in a stand of each rolling mill is set at a 

predetermined value beforehand if there is a roll cross 
angle that will enable a target sheet crown to be applied 

to each sheet and the roll bender load of each stand is 
adjusted on-line, thereby effecting sheet crown control. 

Rolling also may be performed while adjusting the roll 
cross angle of rolls incorporated in stands of each 

rolling mill on-line together with the roll bender load. 
The roll bender load and the roll cross load may be 

adjusted in a transition region where a junction between 
sheets exists or in a stationary region where sheets of 

the same material follow one after another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and rolling
equipment line for use in endless rolling, in which
the trailing edge of a sheet being fed and the leading
edge of another sheet subsequent thereto are joined to
each other on the input side of hot rolling equipment to
continuously roll the sheets, the method and rolling
equipment line quickly imparting an appropriate sheet
crown to each sheet independently of changes in sheet
thickness, sheet width or sheet material.Endless rolling, in which the trailing edge of a sheet
being fed and the leading edge of another sheet subsequent
thereto are joined to each other on the input side
of hot rolling equipment to continuously roll the sheets,
is advantageous in that any trouble caused during sheet
passage can be reduced and that a substantial expansion
of rolling limit can be expected (See Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 4-262804).As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application
No.62-3818, in sheet crown control for a rolling
system as described above, errors in sheet thickness or
anticipated load errors are generally ascertained at
each stand of rollers and, on the basis of the errors thus
ascertained, the load of the roll bender is adjusted,
thereby attaining the target sheet crown.However, this endless rolling, described above, has
the following problem:If the sheets to be joined together are made of the
same material and have the same thickness, it is possible
to continue rolling without any change in the set conditions
for the rolling mill. In reality, however, the
material and size of products to be obtained through hot
rolling varies greatly. That is, the sheets to be rolled are
not always of the same material or size.To make the most of endless rolling, sheets of different
materials and sizes have to be joined to each
other.To impart a desired sheet crown to each sheet to be
rolled, it is necessary to change, during the feeding of
the sheets, the mechanical crown to be imparted by the
upper and lower work rolls so as to keep the mechanical
crown of each sheet in conformity with a target sheet
crown value, in accordance with changes in rolling load
and changes in the target crown for each sheet.However, the conventional technique of changing
the roll bender load for the purpose of changing the
mechanical crown is disadvantageous in that the control
range is very small.Generally speaking, it is only possible for the roll
bender to apply a force which is within approximately ±
120 t of the stress limit of the roll chock, and the amount

Sheet crown control method for continuous rolling

of a plurality of individual sheets using a plurality of
roll stands (5) each comprising a pair of rolls (1,2),

and having adjustable roll cross angles and roll
bending forces characterised in that the method

comprises:

(i) joining the plurality of sheets together so as
to form a continuous strip (3),
(ii) determining, for each sheet and before rolling,
the roll cross angle range (i) in which a

target crown (Chi) can be obtained,
(iii) setting the roll cross angle of each stand to
a common angle within the roll cross angle

range, and
(iv) adjusting the roll bending force of each
stand to achieve the target crown (Chi) for each

sheet.

control is effected for each of the individual sheets

(a) when there is a common roll cross angle
(Θ
A
) common to the roll cross angle range (Θ
i
)
of all the sheets (3) to be continuously rolled,

the roll cross angle (Θ) is set to the common
roll cross angle (Θ
A
) with respect to each of the
stands to set the sheet crown of each sheet (3)

to the target sheet crown (Chi), and
(b) when there is no common roll cross angle
(ΘA) common to the roll cross angle range (Θi)

of all the sheets (3) to be continuously rolled,
the roll cross angle (Θ) is set for each of the

stands to a value within the roll cross angle
range (Θi) for each of the sheets (3) prior to the
