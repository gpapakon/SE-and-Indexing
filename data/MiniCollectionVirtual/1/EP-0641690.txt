<ABSTRACT>
A closure element (72) for an air bag deployment 
opening of an inflatable restraint system (70) including 

tear ways (60') defining two doors (78A, 78B) which permit 
an air bag to deploy therethrough. The closure element 

(72) includes two integral retention bridges (74A, 74B, 
76A, 76B) joining each door (78A, 78B) with a side wall 

(54) of the closure element (72). The retention bridges 
may extend across a portion (64'A) of the tear ways. The 

closure element (72) includes locking arms (56A to 56D) for 
engaging a lip of a reaction housing. The retention 

bridges reduce the chance of the doors becoming detached 
during bag deployment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable restraint 
systems and, more particularly, to an improved closure element for 
use with an installation of an inflatable cushion, commonly 
referred to as an air bag. The value of safety restraint systems which self-actuate from 
an undeployed to a deployed state without the need for intervention 
by the operator, i.e., "passive restraint systems", and 
particularly those restraint systems incorporating inflatable bags 
or cushions has gained general appreciation. It is well known to protect a vehicle occupant using a cushion 
or bag that is inflated with gas, e.g., an "air bag", when the 
vehicle encounters sudden deceleration, such as in a collision. 
During deployment, the rapidly evolving gas with which the bag is 
typically filled is an inert gas, e.g., nitrogen. In such systems, 
the cushion is normally housed in an uninflated and folded 
condition to minimize space requirements. Upon actuation of the air bag system, gas is discharged from 
an inflator to rapidly inflate the bag. In general, such systems 
are designed to result in inflation of the air bag in a matter of 
a few milliseconds and with the bag thus serving to restrain the 
movement of the vehicle occupant as the collision proceeds. For typical driver side inflators used in conventional air bag 
systems, gas pressure ranges between 250-650 kPa, as determined by 
tank testing wherein the inflator is actuated and exhausted into a 
one cubic foot volume tank with the pressure in the tank measured 
at fifty milliseconds after actuation. Those inflators that result 
in such gas pressures ranging from about 450-475 kPa up to about 
650 kPa are hereinafter referred to as high pressure inflators.  
 Inflatable restraint systems have been devised for automotive 
vehicles in which one or more air bags are stored in one or more 
storage compartments within the vehicle. In general, an air bag 
provided for the protection of a vehicle driver, i.e., a driver 
side air bag, is stored within a module including an inflator, the 
air bag itself, a housing, a cover or some form of closure panel 
member, and attachment means mounted in the steering wheel of the 
vehicle. Whereas, an air bag for the protection of a front seat 
passenger, i.e., a passenger side air bag, is typically stored 
within a module mounted in the instrument panel/dash board of the 
vehicle. The covers of such installations commonly include a face 
portion which, in the standard state, provides closure to the 
assembly. Upon activation

A closure element (72) for an air bag deployment 
opening of an inflatable restraint system (70) adapted to 

be integrated into a vehicle with the system (70) including 
a housing (14) for accommodating a collapsed inflatable air 

bag (22), said closure element (72) comprising: 

a mounting portion (54) securable to the housing 
(14) and a face portion (50) connected to the mounting 

portion (54) and having therein a tear way (60', 82, 102) 
adapted to tear to define at least one airbag release door 

(78A, 78B, 90A, 90B, 110A, 110B) formed in the face portion 
(50) characterized in that said closure element includes at 

least one integral retention bridge (74A, 74B, 76A, 76B, 
92A, 92B, 112A, 112B) the or each of which joins said door 

formed in the face portion (50) with said mounting portion 
(54), loops over said tear way (64'A, 89A') or a hinge 

section (111) joining said door and said mounting portion 
(54) so as to prevent tearing of the retention bridge 

during deployment of the airbag (22) and is adapted to join 
said door with said mounting portion (54) to secure the 

door to the mounting portion (54) during deployment of the 
airbag (22). 
The closure element (72) of claim 1 wherein said at 
least one retention bridge (74A, 74B, 76A, 76B, 92A, 92B) 

joins said door (78A, 78B, 90A, 90B) with said mounting 
portion (54) across at least a portion (64'A, 89A') of said 

tear way. 
The closure element (72) of claim 1 or 2 including 
at least one hinge section (88A, 88B, 111) forming a hinge 

adapted to join said release door (90A, 90B, 110A, 110B) 
with said mounting portion (54). 
The closure element (72) of claim 3 wherein said 
tear way extends into said hinge section (88A, 88B, 111).  

 
The closure element (72) of claim 3 or 4 wherein 
said at least one integral retention bridge runs parallel 

to said hinge from said door to said mounting portion. 
The closure element (72) of any preceding claim 
wherein said tear way (60') is continuous and in a numeral 

"8" shaped pattern defining at least two air bag release 
doors (78A, 78B). 
The closure element (72) of any one of claims 1 to 
5 wherein said tear way (82, 102) forms a generally H-shaped 

pattern defining at least two air bag release doors 
(90A, 90B, 110A, 110B). 
The closure element (72) of any preceding claim 
comprising a homogeneous molded plastic member. 
The closure element (72) of any preceding claim 
prepared via injection molding of a thermoplastic rubber. 
The closure element (72) of any preceding claim for 
use in an inflatable restraint system having a high 

pressure inflator (20).

high pressure inflator (20) has a gas pressure in the range 

of from about 450-475 kPa up to about 650 kPa. 
The closure element (72) of any preceding claim for 
a driver side air bag deployment opening located in the 

steering wheel of the vehicle. 
The molded plastic closure element (72) of any
