<ABSTRACT>
At least two locking elements (12,14), shaped as flat, quarter-circle-shaped plates, are fixed next to each other on a lifting truck (50). The movement of the first locking element (12) is transmitted in the opposite direction to the second locking element (14). The locking elements fit from different sides into the holder element (30) to which they are tightly joined in a locking position. The transmission elements are in the form of outward-pointing teeth (24) on the locking elements, which each rotate on their own axle (15,16).

Device for locking adjacent lifting trucks of 
lifting and tilting or tilting devices for emptying 

refuse containers, which has at least one locking 
component, which is attached in a displaceable manner 

to a lifting truck, and which in the locking position 
cooperates with a retention component attached to the 

other lifting truck, and which has an actuating 
component which is attached to the locking component, 

characterised in that: 

at least two locking components (12, 14) are 
attached adjacent one another on a lifting truck (50), 

such that movement of the first locking component (12) 
is conveyed to the second locking component (14) in an 

opposite direction, by transmission means; 
the locking components (12, 14) engage from 
different sides in the retention component (30); and 
in the locking position the locking components 
(12, 14) form an interlocking connection with the 

retention component (30). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the transmission means consist of teeth (24) 

which are disposed on the locking components (12, 14).  
 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the teeth (24) are continually engaged with one 

another. 
Device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the locking components (12, 14) each consist 

of a flat plate with a shape substantially of a 
quarter of a circle. 
Device according to claims 2 to 4, characterised 
in that the teeth (24) are disposed on the 

circumferential arc of the locking components (12, 14) 
which are substantially in the shape of a quarter of 

a circle, and face outwards, such that the locking 
components (12, 14) substantially form a segment of a 

spur gear. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the locking components (12, 14) 

are each disposed in a pivoting manner on their own 
shaft (15, 16) which is perpendicular to their 

surface, such that the shafts (15, 16) of the locking 
components (12, 14) are parallel to one another, and 

disposed such that the rolling circle of the teeth 
(24) of the first locking component (12) and the 

rolling circle of the teeth (24) of the second locking 
component (14) touch at one point.  

 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the retention component (30) has 

a bolt (32) with a flange (34) at the free end, the 
longitudinal axis of which is disposed parallel to the 

rotary shafts (15, 16) of the locking components (12, 
14), when the lifting trucks (50, 52) are in the same 

position. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the locking components (12, 14) 

have recesses (20, 22) in which the bolts (32) of the 
retention component (30) engage, when the locking 

components (12, 14) are in the locking position. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims. 
characterised in that the locking components (12, 14) 

can be stopped in the rest position and in the locking 
position. 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the activation component (42) is also the stop 

device (40). 
Device according to claim 10, characterized in 
that the activation component (42) has a spring-loaded 

grasping component (44), which in the rest position 
and in the locking position engages in recesses (48)  

 
of a stop component (46) which is attached to the 

first lifting truck (50).
