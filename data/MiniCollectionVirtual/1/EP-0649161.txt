<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display device, in particular a cathode ray tube, 
comprising a display screen having an antistatic, light-absorbing coating which contains 
latex particles of electroconductive polypyrrole. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing an antistatic, 
light-absorbing coating on a display screen. Antistatic coatings are used on display screens of display devices, in 
particular cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Said coatings are sufficiently electroconductive to 
ensure that a high electrostatic voltage present on the outside surface of the display 
screen is removed within a few seconds. Thus, the user does not experience an 
unpleasant shock if he touches the screen. Besides, the attraction of atmospheric dust is 
reduced. Light-absorbing layers which reduce the light transmission are used on 
display screens of display devices, for example cathode ray tubes and liquid crystal 
display devices (LCD and LC-TV), to improve the contrast of the image reproduced. 
By virtue thereof, the necessity of changing the glass composition of the display screen 
is avoided and the possibilities of bringing the light transmission to a desired value in a 
simple manner are increased. Such filtering layers reduce the transmission of incident 
ambient light as well as light originating from the internal light source, for example the 
CRT phosphors. The incident ambient light passes through the light-absorbing coating 
and the glass display screen, subsequently, reflects off the rough phosphor layer on the 
inside of the display screen and again passes through the display screen and the light-absorbing 
coating. If the transmission of the light-absorbing coating amounts to T, then 
the intensity of the reflected ambient light is reduced by a factor of T2. Light 
originating from the CRT phosphors passes only once through the light-absorbing 
coating, so that the intensity of this light is reduced only by a factor of T. The 
combination of these effects causes an increase of the contrast by a factor of T. In European Patent Application EP-A-533256, filed by Applicants, a 
description is given of the manufacture of an antistatic, light-absorbing coating which  
 
comprises a layer of a matrix of silicon dioxide and latex particles consisting of an 
electroconductive polypyrrole compound. In the known method, an aqueous dispersion 
of polypyrrole latex particles is added to an aqueous solution of a hydrolysed alkoxy 
silane compound, whereafter the dispersion is provided on the display screen
