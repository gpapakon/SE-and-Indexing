<ABSTRACT>
A novel off-line bootstrap startup circuit (10) including a high 
voltage device (100) for providing an initial bias voltage to an 

integrated circuit (IC) is provided. The high voltage device includes 
an NMOS transistor (102) having a high source to ground breakdown 

voltage thereby extending a bias voltage range provided to the IC. 
This bias voltage range may be needed to support large comparator 

(303) hysteresis and allow for an unregulated bias voltage. The 
bootstrap startup circuit becomes inoperative when the bias voltage 

exceeds a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to startup circuits and, more 
particularly, to bootstrap startup circuits that are used in power 
supplies to initialize the bias voltage to integrated circuits. Generally, a bootstrap startup circuit provides an initial 
voltage across a capacitor prior to a power supply for the 
integrated circuit attaining its predetermined value. Further, the 
bootstrap startup circuit is turned off once the power supply 
attains its predetermined value. Typically, a bootstrap startup circuit may include a single 
resistor or a power up transistor circuit. However, a disadvantage of 
the single resistor bootstrap startup circuit is that it draws a 
significant amount of current, while a disadvantage of the integrated 
power up transistor bootstrap startup circuit is that the bias 
voltage range is limited to a maximum of approximately 10-15 volts. 
This limited bias voltage range may become a problem when a wider 
bias voltage range is needed such as when primary-side control 
integrated circuits have an input voltage range of 10-30 volts. Hence, there is a need for a bootstrap startup circuit that has a 
lower current drain and for providing a wide bias voltage range. FIG. 1 is a detailed schematic diagram illustrating an off-line 
bootstrap startup circuit in accordance with the present invention; FIG.'s 2 and 3 are detailed pictorial diagrams illustrating 
cross-section views of a high voltage device shown in FIG. 1; and FIG. 4 is a schematic/block diagram illustrating a circuit 
including the off-line bootstrap startup circuit of FIG. 1 for 
switching an inductive load. Generally, the present invention provides a circuit coupled to a 
line voltage for providing a wider bias voltage range to an integrated 
circuit. This is accomplished by using a technique known as 
bootstrapping. A high voltage startup device provides bias current to 
initialize the supply voltage to a control circuit. However, once the 
power supply of the integrated circuit reaches its predetermined 
value, the startup device is switched off to minimize power 
dissipation. Thus, the present invention describes a novel high 
voltage startup device that simplifies circuit design, increases the 
supply voltage range of the control circuit, and eliminates the need 
for a dedicated high voltage pin, if a power switching transistor is 
integrated in the same package. The present invention can be more fully described with 
reference to FIG.'s 1-4. FIG. 1 is a detailed schematic diagram 
illustrating an off-line bootstrap
