<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fibre connectors
and relates more specifically to such connectors of the so-called
expanded beam type.Expanded beam optical fibre connectors may comprise
at least one convex (e.g. sphere) lens which is maintained
in predetermined spaced alignment with the polished end face
of an optical fibre which may be retained within the central
aperture of a support ferrule (e.g. ceramic).For the purpose of ensuring that the end face of the
optical fibre is in precise active and mechanical spaced
alignment with a sphere lens, the lens and the optical fibre
terminating end of the ferrule may be seated against the
respective surfaces of axially-spaced oppositely facing
precision-machined conically-shaped cavities defined by the
profile of a main bore of a lens/ferrule support structure
which provides a relatively small bore extending between the
respective cavities affording active alignment of the
optical fibre end face relative to the sphere lens.To avoid the need for providing such conical cavities
which can only be precision machined from opposite ends of
the main bore in the support structure for accommodating the
lens/ferrule assembly, the sphere lens and the optical fibre
terminating ferrule may be positioned in predetermined
spaced relationship with each other by the interposition of
a spacer plate between the lens and the fibre terminating
end of the ferrule. However, in a known construction of expanded beam
connector a spacer plate is provided having a central
aperture with a flared end portion on which the sphere lens
is seated to provide the requisite alignment and spacing
between the sphere lens and the end face of the ferrule-terminated
optical fibre. The sphere lens, spacer and
ferrule are held captive within a hollow cylindrical housing
providing the aforesaid main bore and co-operating therewith
to provide a discrete optical contact assembly for insertion
into an aperture in a connector body. A plurality of such
discrete contact assemblies may be positioned in respective
apertures of the connector body in the case of a multi-way
expanded beam optical connector.The sphere lens, spacer plate and optical fibre-terminating
ferrule of this known construction of connector
are held captive in the housing by means of a tubular
member which is a press fit in the housing and provides a
fixed abutment for the end of the optical fibre terminating
ferrule remote from the spacer-plate and sphere lens while
radially inwardly deformed retention fingers formed
integrally with the

<CLAIMS>
An expanded beam optical fibre connector comprising at least
one lens/optical fibre alignment assembly including an outer

member (1) having a main bore (2) therein which accommodates
a lens (3), an optical fibre terminating ferrule (4) which is

a sliding fit in the main bore (2), and means (8,14) for
resiliently biasing the ferrule (4) towards a lip (18) at a

forward end of the main bore (2) characterised in that:

the lens (3) is of spherical shape,
the lip (18) is formed so as
to limit the forward movement of the spherical lens (3),
a spacer/alignment member (15) which is a sliding fit in the
main bore (2) is provided between the ferrule (2) and the

spherical lens (3) with the spacer/alignment member (15)
having a through hole (20) and a front recess surface

(17) on which the spherical lens is seated,
so that the means (8,14) for
resiliently biasing the ferrule (4) bias the ferrule forwardly towards the

spacer/alignment member (15) to press the spherical lens (3)
into said front recess surface (17) and against the lip (18) thereby to

provide active alignment and the required spacing between
the ferrule terminated end face (6) of the optical fibre in the ferrule and

the spherical lens (3) the arrangement being such that it
facilitates easy removal of the ferrule (2), spacer (15) and

spherical lens (3) from the end of the main bore (2) remote
from the lip (18).
A connector as claimed in claim 1, in which the
front recess surface (17) of the spacer/alignment member

(15) is conically-shaped and seats and thereby centralises
the sphere lens (3) of the assembly relative to the end face

(6) of a ferrule terminated optical fibre (5).
A connector as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that the lip (18) is integral with the outer member (1)

and is formed with a surface that is inclined with regard to
the axis of the bore for contact with the spherical

lens (3).
A connector as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the main bore has an

enlarged section (10) towards its rear end and the means 
(8,14) for biasing includes a termination sleeve (8)

disposed within the enlarged section (10) in a sliding fit,
the sleeve having a surface that abuts the ferrule (4) to

push the ferrule forwardly, and a resilient member (14) that
engages the sleeve.
A connector as claimed in claim 4, in which the
terminating sleeve (8) is sealed relative to the surrounding

enlarged main bore surface (26).
A connector as claimed in claim 4 or 5,
characterised in that the resilient member (14) is an "O"

ring.
A connector as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer member (1)

providing the main bore comprises a connector body.
A connector as claimed in claim 7, in which the
connector body (1) is provided with a plurality of main

bores (2) each of which accommodates an identical
lens/optical alignment assembly each including a lens (3),

spacer/alignment member (15) and ferrule (4) to provide a
multi-way expanded beam connector.
A connector as claimed in claim 8,
characterised in that the connector body (1) has location

pins (23, 24) projecting from the front end thereof for
engagement with location holes in a further connector to be

coupled to it.
A connector as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that retaining means

(12) is located at the rear end of the connector opposed to the forward
end having said lip and removal

or displacement thereof facilitates removal of the spherical

lens (3), spacer/alignment member (15) and ferrule (4) from
the rear end of the main bore.
A connector as claimed in claim 10, characterised
in that the retaining means comprises a securing member (12)

which lies immediately behind the outer member (1) with respect to the lip and which
is detachable from the outer member, the securing member

having a stepped bore (11) with a forward portion aligned
with the enlarged section (10) of the main bore (2) of the 

outer member (1) and with a narrower rear portion and the
termination sleeve (8) has a front portion disposed in the

forward portion of the stepped bore (11) which includes the
means for biasing (14)

the termination sleeve (8) forwardly towards said lip.
A connector as claimed in claim 10, in
which the retaining means (12) comprises an apertured or

slotted plate removably attached to the rear of the
connector and normally preventing removal of the lens (3),

spacer/alignment member (15) and ferrule (4) assembly, or
assemblies, from the rear end of the main bore (2) or bores.
