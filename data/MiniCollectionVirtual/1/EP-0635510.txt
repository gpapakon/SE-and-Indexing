<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for converting 
a high-boiling component resulting from the reaction of an 

organochloride with silicon into commercially more desirable 
monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the high-boiling 

component with hydrogen chloride at a temperature 
within a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. in the presence of a 

catalyst selected from activated carbon, platinum supported 
on alumina, zeolite, AlCl₃ and AlCl₃ supported on a support 

selected from carbon, alumina and silica.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for converting
a high-boiling component, resulting from the reaction of an
organochloride with silicon, into more commercially
desirable monosilanes. The process comprises contacting the
high-boiling component with hydrogen chloride at a
temperature within a range of 250°C. to 1000°C. in the
presence of a catalyst selected from
platinum supported on alumina, zeolite, AlCl3 and AlCl3
supported on a support selected from carbon, alumina and
silica.The high-boiling component useful in our process
results from a process typically referred to as the "Direct
Process," where an organohalide is reacted with silicon in
the presence of a suitable catalyst to form monosilanes.
The Direct Process is described more fully in US-A 2,380,995
and US-A 2,488,487. It is the main commercial process by
which organohalosilanes (i.e. monosilanes), for example
dimethyldichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane, are
formed. These organohalosilanes are reactive compounds
which can undergo numerous reactions to form a variety of
useful silicon containing compounds and polymers. A major
commercial use of organohalosilanes is in the production of
polysiloxane polymers which are useful as heat transfer
fluids, lubricants and the like and which can be further
processed, for example, to form silicone elastomers, resins,
sealants and adhesives.Operation of the Direct Process results not only
in the production of the desirable monosilanes, but also in 
a high boiling component typically considered to be all
materials with a boiling point higher than the particular
diorganodihalosilane produced in the process. The high-boiling
component is a complex mixture that includes
compounds containing SiSi, SiOSi, SiCSi, SiCCSi and SiCCCSi
linkages in the molecules. Typical compounds are described
in US-A 2,598,435 and US-A 2,681,355. The high-boiling
component may also comprise silicon containing solids and
soluble and insoluble compounds of copper, aluminum and
zinc.In current commercial operations for performing
the Direct Process, the high-boiling component can
constitute as much as ten percent of the resultant product.
Therefore, it is desirable to convert the high-boiling
component into more commercially desirable products to both
reduce low-value by-products and to improve raw material
utilization.The prior art for converting the high-boiling
component of the Direct Process into more usable monosilanes
is represented by US-A 2,598,435; US-A 2,681,355; US-A
2,709,176 and US-A 2,842,580.The aforementioned
