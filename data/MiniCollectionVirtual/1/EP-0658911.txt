<ABSTRACT>
A snap acting control member (10, 10
b
) having high actuating 
temperatures comprises metal layers metallurgically bonded 

together with a low expansion (12) and a relatively high 
expansion layer (14) each having similar moduli of elasticity and 

the low expansion layer being formed of a precipitation 
hardenable stainless steel so that after forming into a dished 

shaped configuration to make the member snap acting the low 
expansion layer is heat treated to increase the strength. The 

control member can be used solely to sense temperature or it can 
be used as an electrical current carrying member. When used in 

the latter manner, the electrical resistivity of the member can 
be adjusted by interposing a selected layer (16) between layers 

(12) and (14) to thereby increase or decrease the resistivity of 
the member (10
b
) depending on the particular metal chosen for the 
interlayer. An electrical switch (24) is shown in which a snap 

acting member is used as a sensor and another electrical switch 
(48) is shown in which the snap acting member is a current 

carrying member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to snap acting thermostatic
disc members which are used for performing control functions and
more particularly to thermally responsive snap acting members
embodying iron alloy materials selected for strength and
temperature resistance properties for use with electrical
switches employing high temperature snap acting members.A known type of thermally responsive control member used
for performing control functions has a dished shaped
configuration of precisely predetermined shape which cooperates
with the characteristics of the metal materials embodied in the
member so that the member moves to an inverted or oppositely
dished shaped configuration with snap action on the occurrence of
the member reaching a selected actuating temperature. The member
is then movable to return to its original dished shaped
configuration on the occurrence of the member reaching a second
de-actuation, or differential, temperature to reset the member.
Usually there is a substantial difference between the actuating
temperature and the reset temperature in order to provide
hysteresis and avoid unnecessary cycling of the member.Such thermally responsive dished shaped metal control
members are formed into the precisely predetermined
configurations in well known ways and are typically formed of 
iron alloys to provide strength where the elements are intended
to operate at elevated temperatures. One known material system
is the use of an iron alloy referred to herein as Alloy 10 as a
low expansion layer bonded to another iron alloy referred to
herein as Alloy B as a high expansion layer which can provide
relatively stable snap acting disc members at low actuation
temperatures. However, when the disc members are formed so that
the actuating temperature is increased the disc members become
unstable above some threshold level dependent upon the geometry
of the member and the sigma distribution increases so that the
disc members start to fall out of a tolerance range for a given
application. Such known disc members having a moderately high
actuation temperature, e.g., 130 - 150° C, frequently are
unstable undergoing significant variations or changes in thermal
response characteristics during snap action movement and thermal
cycling of the members so that even if they originally met
desired performance specifications, over time many drift out of
the tolerance range. For example, for certain geometries for
some members having an actuating temperature as low as
approximately 130° C the temperature response of
