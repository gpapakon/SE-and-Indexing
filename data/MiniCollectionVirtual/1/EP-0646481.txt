<ABSTRACT>
A subtractor calculates an actual wheel speed difference 
between rotational speeds of left and right wheels on 

a motor vehicle, and a steering angle converter calculates an 
actual steering angle from the actual wheel speed difference. 

The difference between the actual steering angle and an adequate 
steering angle which is produced based on a lateral acceleration 

is compared with a predetermined reference range. 
If the difference between the actual and adequate steering 

angles exceeds the predetermined reference range, then the 
pneumatic pressure of a tire on one of the left and right 

wheels is determined as being lowered. In the steering angle 
converter, a weight value is established according to a running 

condition of the motor vehicle, and the calculated actual 
steering angle or comparative sensitivity is varied according 

to the weight value. Since the comparative sensitivity 
is varied according to the running condition, a reduction 

in the pneumatic pressure of the tire can be detected even 
under running conditions which lead to large errors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for detecting 
a change in the pneumatic pressure of a tire on a motor 
vehicle, according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a system is known for example from EP-A-0 554 131, 
corresponding to Japanese patent publication JP-A-05-213 019. Other known apparatus and methods for detecting a change 
in the pneumatic pressure of a tire include a tire pressure 
detector having a pressure sensor attached to a wheel as disclosed 
in Japanese patent publication No. 56-10202, a method 
for detecting a reduction in the pneumatic pressure of a tire 
by comparing the detected speeds of wheels as disclosed in 
EP-A-0 291 217 corresponding to 
Japanese laid-open patent publication JP-A-63-305011, and a 
system for detecting a reduction in the pneumatic pressure of 
a tire by comparing the difference between wheel speeds and a 
motion condition of the motor vehicle as disclosed in EP-A-0 497 120. In the systems disclosed in EP-A-0 554 131 and EP-A-0 497 120, 
since any change in the wheel speeds which 
is caused by a reduction in the pneumatic pressure of the 
tire is of a very small value, it may be obscured or masked 
by errors contained in the wheel speeds depending on running 
conditions of the motor vehicle. Therefore, highly accurate detection of any change 
which is brought about in the wheel speeds by a reduction in 
the pneumatic pressure of the tire requires that errors contained 
in the wheel speeds depending on running conditions of 
the motor vehicle be removed. One problem with such an approach 
is that if running conditions which lead to large 
wheel speed errors are left out of consideration, then any 
pneumatic tire pressure reduction cannot be detected under 
those running conditions. There has been a demand for a system 
capable of detecting the pneumatic pressure of a tire under 
running conditions leading to large errors and upon a 
failure such as a brake failure which greatly affects running 
conditions.  
 It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tire pressure change detecting system 
which can detect a change in the pneumatic pressure of a tire 
under running conditions leading to large errors and upon a 
failure such as a brake failure which greatly affects running 
conditions. According to the present invention, this object is achieved by 
a system for detecting a change in the pneumatic pressure 
of a tire on a motor vehicle, as defined in claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in 
the
