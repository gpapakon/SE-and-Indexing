<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester film
with a thermosetting resin adhesive layer, which is
adapted to form a protective coat on a metal surface of a
can. For example,
the coating is formed on
a surface of a metal sheet for forming a
can body, such as a surface-treated steel sheet both end
edges of which are overlapped and welded to
form the can body, or on an outer side wall of a
closed-end cylindrical can having an opening at one end
thereof which is formed by drawing with ironing or the like
from a metal sheet such as an aluminum
alloy sheet. The invention also relates to a production process for
the same.Known welded metal cans
for beverages are
obtained by welding both end
edges of a strip-like can body blank (obtained by cutting a
surface-treated steel sheet for cans which has a tin
deposit) to each other to form a can body.
The can ends are separately produced and attached to both open ends of the can
body by double-seaming. In order to prevent corrosion
of the surface-treated steel sheet base 
metal due to the contact of the base metal with the
contents in a can, and to prevent any change in the flavor of the
contents which is caused by metal components dissolved
out, the welded cans as described above have previously
been coated with a coating such as an epoxy-phenolic resin
on the inside thereof. On the other hand, coating has
been conducted on the outside of the can to impart a good
aesthetic appearance.Such welded cans have been produced by
baking the cans in a heating oven once coating had been completed on
each side of the surface-treated steel sheet for cans.
Therefore, in this production process, heat in the heating
oven and vaporized organic solvents have a tendency to
impair a working environment. In particular, the tendency
becomes more pronounced on the outer surface of the can,
which is subjected to multicolor printing, because baking
is carried out in the heating oven whenever printing is
conducted with each of two to four coatings of different
colors.It is known to cover both sides of the
surface-treated steel sheet used to make cans with a polyester film
to form protective coatings. Such coverings can prevent the
surface-treated steel sheet from corrosion on the inside
of the can, and moreover protect the flavor of the
contents in the can from being changed due to components
being slightly dissolved out of the coating film on the can on 
the inside of which an internal protective coating has
been applied and baked as described above. On the other
hand, a good aesthetic
