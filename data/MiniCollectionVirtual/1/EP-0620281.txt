<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oilseed crops 
producing valuable seeds having altered amino acid 
composition and fatty acid composition, and to a method for 
preparing such crops. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to oilseed crops with an introduced 
antisense gene of seed storage protein and to a method for 
preparing such crops. The term "oilseed crops" as used herein refers to 
crops which are used to obtain oils (fats) from their 
seeds. Such crops have been widely cultivated as sources 
for edible oils, such as a rapeseed oil and a sesame oil, 
or as sources for a variety of oils for industrial use. 
For example, Brassica plants, of which seeds include lipids 
at about 60% of the seed weight, are cultivated in various 
places in the world. The oilseed meals contain proteins at 
high level and have been used as feed and fertilizers. However, a rapeseed oil has been known to contain an 
erucic acid, which is harmful to human, and oilmeal of 
Brassica species has been known to contain glycocynolates 
which are associated with toxic effects on livestocks. 
Therefore, a great effort had been made to lower the amount 
of such harmful components by conventional plant breeding.  
 
As the result, a "double low" variant has been developed in 
Canada, which contains erucic acid at less than 2% of the 
seed weight in its seed oil, and glycocynolate at less than 
30 micromol per 1 g of meal. Recently, oil consumption has been increased and the 
associated market has become in need of diversity of oil. 
Accordingly, oilseeds with high lipid content and with 
valuable fatty acid compositions are needed for a variety 
of purposes. For example, as edible oil, oilseeds 
containing negligible erucic acid and low levels of 
staturated fatty acid are desired because such oils are 
good for human health. On the other hand, oilseeds 
containing large amounts of erucic acid, medium-chain fatty 
acid, and/or polyunsaturated fatty acid are desired for 
industrial purpose. As for meal, those including a large 
amount of proteins or essential amino acids are desired. It is laborious to develop new desirous breeds and it 
is difficult to alter valualbe components in seeds for 
specific purpose by conventional breeding methods with 
crossing. Conventional breeding with crossing comprises 
very laborious and time-consuming processes which aim at 
the selection of desired breeds from various variants and 
establishment of pure lines. Other methods, such as Î³-ray 
irradiation and somaclonal variation, have been
