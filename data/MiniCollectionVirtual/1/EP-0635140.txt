<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fibre couplers.It is often necessary to branch an optical fiber into more
than two output fibers. Typical applications requiring such
branching are found in fiber optic communication
distribution systems. It is customary, if not necessary, to
branch fibers in binary steps, e.g., 1 fiber branches into
2, 4, 8, or 16 fibers. In such a coupler, or splitter, the
percentage of input light distributed to each of the output
branches should be constant over a range of environmental
extremes. This percentage should be stable over relatively
wide thermal regimes, e.g., -40 to 80 degrees centigrade,
should be independent of the input optical polarization
state, and should be substantially constant over a range of
optical wavelengths envisioned for the optical system. The
intrinsic, or built-in, uniformity of the percentage of
input light delivered to each output depends upon the
repeatability of the manufacturing process.Optical fiber couplers can be made by fusing two or
more optical fibers during a tensioned elongation according
to a process that has become familiar to those skilled in
the art known as fused tapering. Key to the success of this
operation is control of the placement of fibers prior to
fusion. Fibers must be made to contact each other in the
region to be heated and fused. Imperfections in or dirt on
the surfaces of fibers, minor imbalances in tension forces
applied to the fibers prior to application of fusion heat,
and three dimensional non-uniformity of the heat applied
are among factors which account for a low success rate of 
fused tapered couplers in manufacturing setups.One prior approach to establishing and maintaining
reliable contact among fibers prior to and during fusion
employs a surrounding tube of optical material. Fibers in
the set to be fused are placed inside a tube of lower
refractive index than the cladding material of the fibers.
The entire assembly is then heated and drawn in the usual
manor. This approach can yield very good results in terms
of uniformity and excess loss.Couplers made using a surrounding optical media can
be made to have a degree of wavelength tolerance over the
1200 nm to 1600 nm optical wavelength band. According to
the methods of prior art, such 1x7 couplers are drawn until
substantially equal power is output from all seven fibers
at two predetermined wavelengths, e.g., 1300 and 1500 nm.
When this is done the six surrounding fibers demonstrate a
variation of optical coupling of the order of 3.0 percent
over wavelength range of 1200
