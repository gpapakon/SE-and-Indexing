<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a bleaching gel cleaner and a method for 
preparing it, said cleaner comprising: 


a) an effective amount of a hypochlorite-generating compound; 
b) a ternary thickening system which comprises: (i) alkali metal 
soap; (ii) a hydrotrope selected from the group consisting of 

trialkylamine oxides, betaines and mixtures thereof; and (iii) a 
bleach stable solvent, each in amounts appropriate to create a 

gelled composition; 
c) a buffer/electrolyte in an amount effective to stabilize the 
hypochlorite; and 
d) the remainder as water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thickened 
bleaching gel cleaners containing hypochlorite bleach 
with improved thickening and bleach stability, and to a 
method of preparing such bleaching gel cleaners. Thickened hypochlorite bleach solutions or compositions have 
long been used in a variety of applications including hard surface cleaning, 
disinfecting and the like. These compositions are typically provided with 
increased viscosity for a number of reasons, principally to increase residence 
time of the composition on non-horizontal surfaces. Many different examples of thickened hypochlorite bleach 
compositions have been available from a wide variety of sources for use in 
hard surface cleaning. For example, Finley et al., European Patent 
Application EP 373,864 and Prince et al.. U.S. Patent 5,130,043, disclosed 
hypochlorite bleach compositions consisting of polyacrylate thickeners. amine 
oxide detergent, and optional fatty acid soap and/or a bleach stable synthetic 
anionic detergent for cleaning hard surfaces such as toilet bowls, bathroom 
tiles and shower walls. Other prior art references have also described various 
thickened automatic dish washing liquid compositions using polyacrylates in 
combination with colloidal thickeners to provide proper rheology and stability 
in hypochlorite bleach compositions including various adjuncts. Stoddart, U.S. 
Patent 4,576,728, and Corring, U.S. Patent 4,836,948, are representative of 
these other prior art references. However, as can be seen from the disclosures 
of each reference, there must be a polyacrylate thickener present in order to 
obtain the desired viscosity. Additionally, other examples of thickened hypochlorite- 
containing cleansers in the art, which usually are used to suspend abrasives, 
typically require either a colloidal clay thickener, such as disclosed in Hartman, 
U.S. Patents 3,985,668, 4,005,027 and 4,051,056, a mixture of surfactants, such  
 
as disclosed in Jones et al., U.S. Patent 4,352,678, or a stearate soap, such as 
disclosed in Chapman, U.S. Patent 4,240,919. All of these systems suffer from 
disadvantages, such as premature hardening in the colloidal clay-thickened 
systems, or poor phase stability, as in the stearate-thickened systems. Some references describe the unique phenomena that occurs 
when certain charge-bearing surfactants, such as quaternary ammonium 
compounds or betaines, are combined with a source of a counterion. U.S. 
Patents 4,900,467, 5,011,538 and 5,055,219, all issued to Smith (and of common
