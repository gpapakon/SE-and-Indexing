<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a twin-hulled vessel with variable widths in which two floats (1, 2) are connected to one another via a variable connection device (4). The distance of the floats can be varied in relation to one other another by means of the variable connection device. The boat is fully capable for water operation when floats are separated at the maximum distance, whereas the boat has a smaller berth requirement when the floats are arranged at a minimal distance from one another. The connection device (4) supports the central unit (3) which comprises a useful storage unit (5). The floats (1, 2) do not have a continuous deck height along their entire length, rather they have sunken areas (120, 220). Said sunken areas (120, 220) are pushed under the useful storage unit (5) when the floats are adjusted to a minimal distance.
