<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connector for plate-like wall components (3, 8) in this case glass panes, in particular, with which there is no need for costly glass cutting. Here, only drillings are rather made inside the glass panes into which a connector half (10, 22) is fitted on each side. The connector halves are secured together by a screw (23).

<CLAIMS>
A connecting element for connecting panel-like wall elements (3, 5, 
8, 16), particularly glass wall elements, to one another or to side 

walls, comprising two connecting-element halves (10, 22) or (15, 
29, 30 or 31), at least one half (10, 22, 15, 29, 30 or 31) having at 

least one projection (20) and a securing element which extends 
through each projection (20) and holds the wall elements (3, 5, 8, 

16) against one another, and the connecting elements are 
disposed at precise locations along the edge of the wall element, 

characterised in that the projection (20) or the projections (20) are 
so disposed that each projection (20) has a corresponding 

connecting bore (25, 27) which is associated in parts with two or 
more wall elements or completely with a single wall element, so 

that the gap at the joint is of only tolerance-compensating size, to 
give a substantially seamless join. 
A connecting element according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the projection (20) is circular or a circular segment, and the 

connecting bore (25, 27) is circular or a circular segment 
corresponding to the projection. 
A connecting element according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
web (17, 19) extending over the entire connecting-element half 

(10) is provided in the central region and is constructed either so 
as to form a defined gap (28) or is in the form of an arm (19) with 

positive and non-positive facilities of attachment to an adjacent 
side wall (14). 
A connecting element according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the connecting-element halves (10, 15, 22, 29, 30, 31) are 

connected to one another by a screw element. 
A connecting element according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the connecting-element halves (10, 15, 22, 29, 30, 31) are 

connected to one another by a snap-in/clip connection (23).  
 
A connecting element according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the halves (10, 15, 22, 29, 30, 31) are 

made of plastic. 
A connecting element according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the halves (10, 15, 22, 29, 30, 31) are 

made of stainless steel. 
A connecting element according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the projection (20) on one connecting-element 

half (10, 22, 15, 29, 30 or 31) is central, or in that a projection or 
two projections (20) are eccentric. 
A connecting element according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the halves (10, 22, 29, 30) are in the form of a circular flat plates. 
A connecting element according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the halves (15, 31) are in the form of semicircular flat plates.
