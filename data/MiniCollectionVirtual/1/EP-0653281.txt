<ABSTRACT>
In the production of an annular, hollow plastic injection-moulded component (1) using the internal gas-pressure method, an insert (4), which adjoins the gas needle (3) and through which a gas duct (5) runs, is placed in the injection mould before introduction of the polymer melt. This insert (4) consequently directs the gas stream in a desired direction. The insert (4) consists of the same plastic material as the component (1) to be moulded and begins to melt at the surface due to the hot surface of the plastic material, so that an intimate bond forms between the insert (4) and the component (1) to be moulded.

A method for injection moulding of plastics material with gas introduced into 
the cavity (2) of a component part (1) to be moulded in an injection mould 

via a gas needle (3) penetrating through the wall of the component part, 
characterised in that an insert (4) is placed in the injection mould and 

connected to the gas needle (3) prior to the introduction of the polymer 
mass, through which a gas conducting channel (5) runs. 
An injection moulding method according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that a component part (1) with a substantially annular cavity 

(2) is manufactured and the gas conducting channel (5) opens solely into 
one of the front faces of the insert (4) facing the cavity (2). 
An injection moulding method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the insert (4) is pre-fabricated from a plastics material 

which is substantially the same as the plastics material of the component 
part (1) to be moulded, in order to form an homogenous connection with it. 
An injection moulding method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the insert (4) has a conical take-up hole (8) for the gas 

needle (3) to which the gas conducting channel (5) is connected and by 
means of which the insert (4) is plugged onto the gas needle (3). 
An injection moulding method according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that, with the aid of the front face (9) of the insert, which 

lies opposite the discharge hole (6) of the gas conducting channel (5), both 
the plastics material melt and the gas are diverted.
