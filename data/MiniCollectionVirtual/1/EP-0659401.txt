<ABSTRACT>
A semi-paste oral preparation comprises, as effective 
ingredients, at least 0.1 to 20% by weight of povidone-iodine 

based on the total weight of the preparation, and 0 to 50 parts 
by weight of potassium iodide and 1 to 300 parts by weight of a 

sugar alcohol of an oligosaccharide as a base and stabilizer, 
the parts by weight being based on one part by weight of the 

povidone-iodine. This semi-paste oral preparation has a 
modest viscosity, good taste and good stability upon storage 

for a long time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semi-paste oral 
preparation (toothpaste) comprising inter alia 
povidone-iodine. It is well known that povidone-iodine is effective 
against pathogenic bacteria for periodontal diseases: 
"SHIKAI TENBO (Dental Review)" Vol. 70, No. 6 (1987) 
p.1409-1415; "Proceedings of 1989 Meeting of the Dental 
Society in Nippon Dental University", p.26, September 
10, 1989. It is also known that potassium and/or sodium iodide 
is used as a stabilizer for solutions containing 
povidone-iodine, and that potassium and/or sodium iodide 
and sodium and/or potassium chloride are used as 
stabilizers for dentifrices: Japanese Patent 
Application Laying Open (Kokai) Nos. 2-213348 and 
4-173726 and Japanese Patent Application No. 4-156341. 
In order to ensure the quality of these preparations 
during distribution thereof in the market, however, it 
is necessary to formulate large amounts of the 
stabilizers into these preparations, resulting in an  
 
irritatant and/or salty taste. Accordingly, stabilizers 
of better taste would be desirable in view of feeling 
upon use. Maltitol (reducing maltose) and lactitol (reducing 
lactose), which are sugar alcohols of oligosaccharides, 
have been used as wet humectants for dentifrices since 
they are more viscous and have a higher specific 
gravity, more excellent humectant property and better 
flavour and taste as compared with conventional ones. 
Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 40-15120 and 
Japanese Patent Application Laying Open (Kokai) No. 
49-31832. However, maltitol and lactitol have never 
been used as stabilizers for povidone-iodine or bases of 
semi-paste preparations for treating or preventing 
gingivitis, pyorrhea alveolaris and stomatitis, although 
they are used as wet humectants for dentifrices due to 
their excellent humectant properties. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a semi-paste oral preparation for treating and 
preventing gingivitis, pyorrhea alveolaris and 
stomatitis, which contains povidone-iodine and has a 
modest viscosity, good taste and good stability upon 
storage for a long period of time. The present invention provides a semi-paste oral 
preparation comprising, as effective ingredients, at 
least 0.1 to 20% by weight of povidone-iodine based on  
 
the total weight of the preparation, and 0 to 50 parts 
by weight of potassium iodide and 1 to 300 parts by 
weight of a sugar alcohol of an oligosaccharide as a 
base and stabilizer, the parts by weight being based on 
one part by weight of
