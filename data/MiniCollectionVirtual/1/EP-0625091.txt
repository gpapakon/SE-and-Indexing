<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides crystalline polyester articles having an oxygen permeability of from about 0.2 to about 4.9 cc-mil/100 in
<
2
>
-24 hr-atm, and an enthalpy of recrystallization of from about 0 to about -2.1 cal/g. They are prepared by: a) heating a crystallizable polyester above the temperature of its peak rate of crystallization from melt, b) shaping it at or above this crystallization temperature in a heated form and c) cooling it at a rate of about 5  DEG C to 80  DEG C per minute. The polyester articles are useful as containers for microwavable, ovenable and/or frozen foods. They have good gas barrier properties, and post-mold dimensional sta bility from about -60  DEG C to about 200  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for producing a thermoplastic
crystallizable polyester or a composition comprising such a polyester.
More specifically, the invention relates to a process for producing a
crystallizable polyester or crystallizable polyester composition which
provides a gas barrier characterized by an oxygen permeability of from
0.2 to 4.9 cc-mil/100 in2 (650 cm2)-24 hr-atm at 23°C and relative
humidity of 60 % outside/100 % inside, has a linear dimensional
shrinkage of less than 6 % between 23°C and 200°C, and has an
enthalpy of recrystallization greater than -2.1 cal/g between about 100°C
and about 170°C as determined by heating differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). Due to its high dimensional stability, the product
produced by the process of the invention is useful as a container for food
products, particularly those that are cooked either by microwave or
conventional ovens. Additionally, due to its low gas permeability, the
product produced by the process of the invention is useful for increasing
the shelf life of food and beverage products at temperatures from about
-60°C to about 215°C.Polyesters have heretofore been widely used in the food package
industry, including blister packs for meats, containers for frozen foods,
ovenable and microwavable (〈〈 dual ovenable 〉〉) trays and carbonated
beverage bottles. A major effort in such packaging applications has been
directed toward reducing the gas permeability of the package, since a
decrease in such permeability will lead to a longer shelf life of the food
product, be it at frozen, refrigerated or ambient temperature storage.
Another focus of great effort in the food packaging industry is the
dimensional stability of the package over long periods of time at ambient
temperature or upon heating of the contents in either microwave or
conventional ovens. Of particular concern in this regard are the breakage 
of seals and warping due to excessive shrinkage of the container during
retort or any of the thermal sterilization processes.A number of prior patents have addressed the above-mentioned
concerns, for the most part individually. As a result, for example,
polyester compositions that are particularly suitable as carbonated
beverage containers due to there low gas permeability, are generally
unsuitable for applications and processes requiring elevated
temperatures, as these materials generally exhibit excessive shrinkage
and warping at these higher temperatures. Examples of such prior
activity include:

A process for producing a dimensionally stable polyester with
improved gas barrier properties comprising the steps:


(a) heating a composition comprising a crystallizable polyester to
a temperature above the melting point temperature of the polyester for a

time sufficient to bring said polyester to a substantially amorphous
(greater than 99 weight %) molten state;
(b) controlling cooling of the composition as obtained in step (a) so
as to maintain the polyester at a temperature above the peak

crystallisation rate temperature of said crystallizable polyester, while
simultaneously contacting said polyester to a surface capable of

imparting shape to said polyester, for 20 seconds to 5 minutes,
(c) continuing controlled cooling of the composition by contacting
the composition to surface capable of imparting shape at a cooling rate

of 5°C to 80°C per minute, the said contact surface being at a
temperature of at least the lower boundary crystallization temperature
