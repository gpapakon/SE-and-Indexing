<ABSTRACT>
Device intended for ensuring the treatment of aqueous effluents, especially rainwater by simultaneously carrying out the degritting, degreasing and settling, which comprises a degritter equipped with a grit chamber, through which passes an upward and then downward flow of the water to be treated, a degreasing surface provided above a part of the degritter and above the feed zone of the settler, and a settler which comprises a feed or presettling tank, a floor, a region for laminar settling and an extraction pit, this device being characterised in that the partition (26) separating the degritter (10) from the settler (14) comprises a flap valve (24) making it possible, when opened, to ensure an unperturbed transfer of the raw water towards the settler and therefore good settling during this stage of filling.

Device intended for ensuring the treatment of waste water, by 
carrying out simultaneously sand removal, grease removal and 

settling, which device comprises a sand separator (10) equipped 
with a sand pit and with a partition (11) enabling the sand 

separator to be traversed by a descending and then an ascending 
flow of the water to be treated, a settling tank (14) comprising 

a feed or presettling zone (16), a floor (20), a lamellar 
settling zone (37) and an extraction pit (22) and a grease-removal 

zone (12) provided above a portion of the sand separator 
(1') and of the feed zone (16) of the settling tank (14), this 

device being characterized in that the partition (26) separating 
the sand separator (10) from the settling tank (14) comprises a 

valve (24), allowing the transfer of the raw water to the 
settling tank, and thus the settlement during the filling stage 

of said settling tank, and also a removal of the layer of water 
freed of sand and clarified, situated in the settling tank and 

in the upper part of the sand separator, during the phase of 
emptying the settling tank. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that there is 
provided, in the settling tank (14), a double extraction system 

(28, 30) for ensuring a separate removal of the layer of 
clarified water, on the one hand, and of the sludge and floating 

solids on the other hand. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that this double 
extraction system (28, 30) comprises: 


means (28) provided slightly higher than the high point of the 
floor (20) of the settling tank, for removal of the clarified 

water without removing the sludge and floating solids, these 
means being optionally constructed in the form of a pump (28) 

and,  
 
means (30) for removing the sludge and then the floating solids 
from the settling tank, these means being positioned at the 

bottom of the settling tank and constructed, notably, in the 

form of a pump adapted to be brought into action after removal 
of the upper layer of clarified water by said first means (28). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that storage enclosures are provided for 

clarified water (34) intended for use in cleaning the floor (20) 
of the settling tank. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the device comprises also a system for 

removing the sand (44) at the lower part of the enclosure of the 
sand separator (10), this system using the means (30) provided 

for the removal of the sludge. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the delivery 
of the transfer pump (30) assuring removal of the sludge is 

provided with two valves (40, 42): the one permitting the 
discharge to the drain during the emptying of the settling tank, 

the other permitting transfer to a pit or the like. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the floor (20) of the settling tank is 

compartmented by a certain number of partitions (36), thus 
defining portions of the floor, with each of which there is 

associated a water storage enclosure (34) and a valve with 
diffuser (38), making possible by a flow of water the cleaning 

of this portion of the floor from the water contained in said 
enclosure. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said valve (24) is a weighted valve which  

 
remains closed in the absence of a hydraulic head upstream of 

the partition (26) on which it is mounted. 
Application of the device according to any one of the preceding 
claims to the treatment of rain water.
