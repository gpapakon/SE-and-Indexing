<ABSTRACT>
In order to vary the position of the back in terms of its height above the seat and the limitation of the seat depth caused by this during a seat height adjustment, a transmission mechanism with a flexible, tension- and pressure-transmitting member, such as a steel band (27), is provided, said steel band, appropriately deflected, acting in the tension and pressure direction on a back support (22) running in an inclined guide (21). The transmission member (27) is fixed, on one side, to the base, while its deflected portion is attached to a seat carrier (15). As a result, a continuous adjustment of the back position during adjustment of the seat height is achieved.
