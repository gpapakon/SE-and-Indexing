<ABSTRACT>
The dipping device blocks part of the beam provided by the light source and comprises a plate with a single carrier arm (2), lying above or below the optical axis (3) having an end (5) fitted in an opening (6) of the headlamp reflector (7). The carrier arm is doubled over throughout its length, its wide side faces lying in a vertical plane, the transverse arm (8) of the plate supporting a hollow cylinder (9) at its optical axis end comprising 2 half shells with symmetrical halves joined together by a bridge divided by the fold line for the symmetrical halves.

A shielding device of a dipped headlamp for vehicles, which serves for screening at 
least part of the light rays which emerge directly from a light source (1) of the 

headlamp, and which is manufactured from sheet metal and has a single supporting 
arm (2) which, in the fitting position of the shielding device, runs above or below the 

optical axis (3) and consists of a limb (4) which in the fitting position is aligned in 
the opposite direction to the direction of light emergence and the free end section (5) 

of which is fixed in an opening (6) of the reflector (7), and of a limb (8) which in the 
fitting position runs transversely to the optical axis (3) and which carries a hollow 

cylinder (9) at its end which in the fitting position is directed towards the optical axis 
(3), which hollow cylinder is the optically effective part of the shielding device and 

the centre line of which coincides in the fitting position with the optical axis (3) of 
the reflector (7), characterised in that 


the shielding device, together with its single supporting arm (2), is punched 
in one piece from a sheet metal plate and in its sheet metal blank form (Figure 

4) consists of two symmetrical halves (13 and 14) of approximately equal size, 
the axis of symmetry of which coincides with a bending line (10) around 

which the two halves (13 and 14) are folded together, 
the supporting arm (2) is doubled over its entire length in such a way that in 
the fitting position it extends with broad side faces in a vertical plane, 
the optically active hollow cylinder (9) of the shielding device is assembled 
from two half shells (11 and 12) of the two symmetrical halves (13 and 14), 
on the side of the half shells (11 and 12) remote from the supporting arm (2) 
the two symmetrical halves (13 and 14) of the shielding device are directly  

 
joined to each other by a web (15) through which the bending line (10) for the 

symmetrical halves (13 and 14) of the shielding device passes. 
A shielding device according to claim 1, characterised in that the double free end 
section (5) of the supporting arm (2) tapers towards its free end and can be inserted 

in a self-clamping manner in the opening (6) of the reflector (7), wherein the two 
parts (16 and 17) of the double portion are supported with their sides which face 

away from each other on the inside of the opening (6) and their mutually facing sides 
are seated pressed against each other. 
A shielding device according to claim 2, characterised in that in the fitting position, 
with a reflector (7) made of plastic, the double free end section (5) of the supporting 

arm (2) is assembled from an outer and an inner part (16 and 17) which are of U-shaped 
form in cross-section, wherein the inner U-shaped part (17) projects with the 

free edge of its limbs beyond the limbs of the outer part (16) and can be pressed into 
the inside of the opening (6) of the reflector (7) with plastic deformation in such a 

way that the outer part (17) is seated with the external face of the web (18) joining 
its limbs on the inside of the opening (6) of the reflector (7). 
A shielding device according to claim 3, characterised in that at least one free edge 
of the limbs of the inner U-shaped part (17) is provided with at least one tooth (19) 

serving as a barb, the point of which points in the opposite direction to the direction 
of insertion of the supporting arm (2). 
A shielding device according to claim 3 and 4, characterised in that the web (18) of 
the outer U-shaped part (16) runs in a plane in such a way that it is capable of being 

seated flat against a flattened inside section (20) of the opening (6) of the reflector 
(7). 
A shielding device according to any one of claims I to 5, characterised in that the 
double free end section (5) of the supporting arm (2) is capable of being placed with 

at least one radially outwardly oriented projection (21) on the edge region of the  
 

opening (6) and of the reflector (7), which edge region is oriented opposite to the 
direction of insertion of the supporting arm (2).
