<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid bleaching
composition which is suitable both for laundry and
household applications. Compositions herein are
particularly suitable in laundry applications, as a prewash
bleaching composition.Liquid bleaching compositions are well known In the art.
Amongst the different bleaching compositions available,
those relying on bleaching by hypochlorite are often
preferred, mainly for performance reasons. These
hypochlorite-based compositions are typically used in 
dilute form and are suitable both for laundry and household
applications. However a major drawback associated with
chlorine-based compositions is the malodor they generate
during and after use. Indeed, not only does the
composition itself smell chlorine bleach, but the malodor
remains noticeable on fabrics or surfaces which have been
treated with said compositions, as well as on the skin of
the user of the composition, even after the bleaching
composition has been thoroughly rinsed away.Formulators have tried to solve that problem by designing
perfumed chlorine-based bleaching compositions. However,
this has proved difficult mainly for two reasons. Firstly,
only a few perfume components are available which are
stable in a strong oxidative environment such as a
chlorine-based bleaching composition, resulting in limited
flexibility in designing perfumes for such compositions.
Secondly, chlorine bleach odor is strong and therefore
difficult to mask even when perfumes are present.It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a
chlorine bleaching composition wherein the chlorine odor is
reduced during and after use.Various solutions to this problem have been discussed in
the art. See for instance JP 63108099, where sulphamates
were proposed to diminish chlorine odor. See also ES
8800652 which proposes a process for packaging chlorine
bleach where perfume is injected into the container just
before the container is closed. See also JP62205200 which
proposes certain perfume ingredients in combination with
certain surfactants.Our invention proposes a simple solution to this problem.
We have now found that a chlorine-based bleaching
composition suitable for use in diluted form could be
formulated, which exhibits a reduced chlorine odor upon 
use, by adding a pH buffering means, preferably a carbonate salt and/or a silicate salt in an
aqueous bleaching composition, said composition comprising an alkali metal hypochlorite
(2% - 10% by weight) and a bleach stable perfume and being formulated, at a pH of from
11.5
