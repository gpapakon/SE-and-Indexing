<ABSTRACT>
A torsionally-rigid portal (9) is fixed to the machine bed (2), having a gantry (11) between two lateral uprights (10). The spindle mounting (20) is adjustable along the gantry on a first axis (-Y). The bed protrudes in front of the portal to one side. The uprights can be at the opposite sides of the bed, and can be supported from its protruding end. A closed stiffening rear wall (13) can be mounted between the uprights, and can also be rigidly secured to the bed.

Numerically controlled grinding machine preferably for
grinding metal work pieces, in particular tools, with a

machine bench, with a grinding head, which has at least
one driven grinding spindle having at least one grinding

wheel at its end and which may be displaced via
allocated bearing and guide means relative to the

machine bench at least along two axes standing at right
angles to one another, and with a work piece support,

which is arranged on the machine bench in the active
region of the grinding wheel(s) of the grinding spindle

support, whereby the grinding spindle support and/or
work piece support are allocated program-controlled

control devices imparting to it control movements in the
form of longitudinal movements relative to the

individual axes, and a portal (9) is firmly connected to
the machine bench (2), said portal having two lateral

stands (10) and a horizontal bridge (11), which extends
at a distance above the machine bench (2) and on which

the grinding spindle support (20) is mounted to be
displaceable along a first axis (- y), and whereby the

machine bench (2) is constructed to protrude from the
portal (9) on one side, characterised in that a closed

reinforcing rear wall (13) is arranged between the two
stands (10), so that a torsion-resistant portal (9) is

formed, and that the work piece support (44) is mounted
to be displaceable at least along one axis (+ X').
Grinding machine according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the grinding head may be swivelled around at least

one axis.
Grinding machines according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the two stands (10) are arranged in the region of

opposing sides of the machine bench (2). 
Grinding machines according to Claim 1 or 3,
characterised in that the two stands (10) are supported

towards the protruding face side of the machine bench
(2).
Grinding machine according to Claim 4, characterised in
that the rear wall (13) is also rigidly connected to the

machine bench (2).
Grinding machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the machine bench (2) is

provided on its protruding face side with a contour
essentially in the shape of a part-circle.
Grinding machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it has a covering hood

(50) enclosing at least the grinding spindle support
(20) and the work piece support (44), said hood being

connected to the machine bench (2) and/or the portal (9)
and extending over the machine bench (2).
Grinding machine according to Claim 6, characterised in
that the covering hood (50) is sealed in relation to the

machine bench (2) and/or the portal (9).
Grinding machine according to Claim 6 or 7,
characterised in that the covering hood (50) is

essentially constructed in a bell or part-cylinder
shape.
Grinding machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that lines (34) for the supply

of energy medium and/or lubricant and/or coolant for the
grinding spindle support (20) and its spindle drive are 

housed in the portal (9).
Grinding machines according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the grinding spindle

support (20) bears at least one drive motor (27), which
is coupled with at least one grinding spindle (22) via a

belt drive (30, 31, 32); and that the belt drive is
arranged in a closed housing (21), in the interior of

which an excess pressure of the air in relation to the
environment may be maintained.
Grinding machines according to Claim 10, characterised
in that the belt drive is coupled with the grinding

spindle (22) mounted on two sides in a region between
the two bearing points (23).
Grinding machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the grinding spindle

support (20) is mounted on the bridge (11) via a support
(15), which bears a displaceable cradle (16), through

which a second axis (- z) is defined and which has
bearing means (18, 19) for the grinding spindle support

(20) defining a third axis (+ A), which preferably runs
at right angles to the first (- y) and the second (- z)

axis and extends towards the protruding face side of the
machine bench (2), the grinding spindle support being

mounted on said bearing means to swivel around the third
axis (+ A).
Grinding machine according to Claim 13, characterised in
that at least one grinding spindle (22) intersects the

third axis (+ A) with its spindle axis (32).
Grinding machine according to Claim 13 or 14, 
characterised in that at least one grinding spindle (22)
