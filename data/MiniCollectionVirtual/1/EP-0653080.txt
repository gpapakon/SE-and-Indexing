<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for managing resources allocated in a computer, wherein the allocated resources are maintained or released by time monitoring. In the invention, a task controller (1) is allocated for the management of resources required for a task to be executed; the controller (1) allocates resources (3, 4) required to execute the task; the controller starts time monitoring in each resource; if required by the task, the controller renews the resource allocations before the expiry of the respective time monitoring periods; and the controller (1) releases all resources allocated for the task after the completion of the task.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for managing
resources allocated in a computer, wherein the allocated
resources are maintained or released by time
monitoring.The execution of a specific task in a computer
system often requires co-operation between several
resources based on recurrent use of the hardware,
software and/or memory resources. The use of resources
thus refers to the allocation of the parts of the
computer system for the execution of a specific task,
no matter whether these parts belong to the hardware,
computation or memory capacity of the computer.The resource allocation system has been problematic
in that the known computers do not comprise any
particularly advanced systems for monitoring allocated
resources. Especially after the completion of the task
assigned to the computer, the release of all or some
of the resources may fail for some reason, e.g. due to
malfunction, a programming error, etc. In practice,
this problem easily results in that the system runs
short of certain kind of resources in the long run, or
that there are needlessly allocated resources in the
system for long periods of time. This in turn reduces
the capacity and may finally cause the operation to
cease if all resources of a certain type have been
allocated for one or more tasks which have been
completed a long time ago.One solution to the problem is offered by fixed-time
monitoring which can be used in cases where it is
possible to determine a maximum duration for the task
to be executed by the resource. The resource is allocated
for the maximum period of time, after which the
resource releases itself if it has not yet been 
released. Periodic monitoring has been used for resources
allocated for an indefinite period of time or
for resources allocated for a very long period of
time. It is thereby checked intermittently that all
resources in the system have changed tasks. If this
has not happened, it is checked whether the main task
is still uncompleted throughout the system, on the
basis of which the resources are then released or
maintained unchanged. One application of this procedure
is the virtual memory management, in which the
central memory is divided into pages (resources), and
the use of different memory pages is monitored during
the execution of a program. Unused pages are replaced
with new pages from a mass memory whenever required. A
disadvantage of periodic monitoring is that it loads
the system and is complicated, as the monitoring procedure
that checks all allocated resources has to be
started

<CLAIMS>
Method for managing resources allocated in a
computer, wherein the allocated resources are maintained

or released by time monitoring, 
characterized

by

allocating a task controller (1) for the management
of resources required for a task to be executed;
allocating by the task controller (1) resources
(3, 4) required to execute the task;
starting time monitoring in each resource by the
controller;
renewing the resource allocations by the controller
before the expiry of the respective time

monitoring periods, if required by the task; and
releasing by the controller (1) all resources
allocated for the task after the completion of the

task.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the task controller (1) is
formed as a resource provided with time monitoring.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that when the time monitoring
period of each resource (1, 3, 4) expires without a

renewal, the resource is released spontaneously.
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized

in that the time monitoring period
of each resource (1, 3, 4) is determined on the basis

of the maximal execution time of the task.
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized

in that the time monitoring period
of each resource (1, 3, 4) is determined on the basis

of the probable execution time of the task.
