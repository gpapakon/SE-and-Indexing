<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc reproducing apparatus repeatedly 
reproduces information recorded on an optical disc (8) over a 

desired repeated reproduction interval from a starting 
position to an ending position. The apparatus is provided 

with: an optical pickup (9); a reproducing unit (11, 12, 13, 
14); a moving unit (15) for moving the optical pickup from the 

ending position back to a predetermined position, which is 
positioned at a vicinity of the starting position, in a 

repeated reproduction operation; and a first memory (1) for 
storing the information, which is recorded from the starting 

position to the predetermined position. The predetermined 

position is predetermined such that the information stored in 
the first memory have an information amount corresponding to 

a time enough for the moving unit to move the optical pickup 
from the ending position back to the predetermined position. 

The apparatus is also provided with a controller (5) for 
controlling the reproducing unit to switch an object of 

reproduction from the information read by the optical pickup 
to the information of the first memory when the optical pickup 

arrives at the ending position and to reproduce the information 
of the first memory while the moving unit moves back the 

optical pickup.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an
optical disc reproducing apparatus for reproducing an optical
disc to which various information is recorded, and more
particularly, to an optical disc reproducing apparatus for
repeatedly producing the information recorded on the optical
disc.In a certain kind of optical disc reproducing
apparatus, it is possible to specify the interval between two
positions of the information recorded on the optical disc and
reproduce the information repeatedly between those two
positions. In this case, when the repeated reproduction
starting position and the repeated reproduction ending
position are inputted through an operation unit, a CPU (Central
Processor Unit) supplies the positional information to a
servo-signal processing unit. Then, the servo-signal
processing unit performs the moving control of the optical
pickup on the basis of the positional information. The
recorded information read by the optical pickup, is supplied
to an audio circuit through a signal processing unit, a digital
filter and a D/A (Digital to Analog) convertor.However, in this kind of optical disc reproducing 
apparatus, during the searching operation for the repeated
reproduction i.e. while the optical pickup is moved from the
repeated reproduction ending position to the repeated
reproduction starting position, the reproduction sound is
interrupted since the optical pickup cannot read the
information during the searching operation. However, in case
of the disc jockey (DJ) etc., it becomes quite desirable to
keep the rhythm of the music by performing the repeated
reproduction without interrupting the reproduction sound. US-A- 5 199 019 reflecting the preamble of claim 1 discloses a digital signal information reproduction apparatus,
wherein the digital information recorded on a disc is read therefrom at a speed
higher than a usual speed during a predetermined period from its start, the read
information being stored in a memory, and the information stored in the memory is
read at the usual speed for playing. Therefore, the information has been read from
the disc during a period shorter than the period required for playing so that the
extra time provided after completion of reading the information from the disc can
be used for an exchange of the disc. This permits users to continuously enjoy play
without time loss by exchanging discs.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide an optical disc reproducing apparatus, which can
perform the repeated reproduction without interrupting
