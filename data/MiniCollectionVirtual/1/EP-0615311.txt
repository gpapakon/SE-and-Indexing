<ABSTRACT>
Notches (20A-2) are provided on the inside circumferential surface of the 
annular post fittings (20A, 20B) of a battery terminal fitted over a battery post. 

The sharp tips of these notches bite into the outside circumferential surface 
of the battery post to prevent the battery terminal from rotating on the post.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery terminal 
connected to the electrode (battery post) of a battery 
installed in a motor vehicle, and particularly to a battery 
terminal installed by means of tightening a bolt in a clamping 
member from vertically above. With a conventional battery terminal of this type, 
an annular post fitting is fit over the battery post protruding 
from the battery. The base members contiguous to the free 
ends of the post fitting are then clamped tight to the post 
via a bolt and nut tightened from the side using an impact 
wrench or other power tightening tool. In most late-model passenger vehicles, however, the 
engine room is extremely crowded as a growing number of 
components are installed in a confined space. This makes it 
difficult to adequately tighten the post fitting by applying 
a horizontal force because of interference from other engine 
room components with the tightening tools. It is even 
possible for the impact wrench to contact the negative 
terminal while tightening the positive post fitting, causing  
 
an electrical short which, in a worst-case scenario, could 
cause an engine room fire. The battery terminal shown in Figs. 5a and 5b has 
therefore been proposed (Utility Model Publication (examined) 
4-9736) as a means of solving this problem. With this battery 
terminal, opposing base 3b and tightening members 3c forming 
a taper that is wider at the bottom than at the top are formed 
as part of the terminal body 3. A clamping member 5, forming 
a similar taper that is wider at the bottom than at the top, fits 
over and is then pulled down over the base 3b and tightening 
members 3c by tightening a bolt 4. This causes the post 
fitting 3a to close and clamp the post 2 of the battery 1. The problem with this configuration, however, is 
that on the automobile assembly line many bolts are tightened 
as the assembly line keeps moving, and the torque of the 
impact wrench is not readjusted for each tightening task. As 
a result, bolt tightening using an impact wrench is dependent 
upon the experience of the operator and visual inspection of 
bolt tightness. Torque control is also not generally used when 
tightening the battery terminal bolts. As a result, the 
terminal bolt may be overtightened due to continued tightening 
after the post fitting is sufficiently clamped to the battery 
post. With the battery terminal described above, excessive  
 
tightening force can cause the battery terminal to turn in the direction of arrow 
X in Fig. 5a around the

A battery terminal for tightly clamping a cylindrical battery post (2), 
comprising: 


a terminal body (11) having at least one ring shaped post fitting member 
(20A) defining a post fitting opening and formed with notches (20a-2) in the 

internal wall of the post fitting opening, said post fitting opening being open 
towards one end of the terminal body for defining t
wo arms (21A, 21B and 
21A', 21B'), said arms having tapered walls (21A-1, 21B-1, 21A'-1, 21B'-1); 
a clamping member (12) having tapered sides (26a, 26b, 27a, 27b, 26a', 
26b', 27a', 27b'); and 
urging means (14, 15) for urging said two arms into said clamping 
member for sliding said tapered walls along said tapered sides to close said 

two arms, 
characterized
 in that 
 
said terminal body (11) comprises a folded element (20) having top and 

bottom ring shaped post fitting members (20A, 20B) defining said post fitting 
opening, so that said arms are formed as folded arms (21A, 21B and 21A', 

21B'); and in that the notches (20a-2) in at least one of said ring-shaped post 
fitting members (20A, 20B) are defined between pointed tips projecting from 

the inside circumferential surface of said post fitting member for biting into 
the outside circumferential surface of the battery post (2). 
A battery terminal according to claim 1, wherein said urging means comprise 
a nut (15) held in a space between said two folded arms, and a bolt (14) 

engaged in said clamping member (12) and threaded into said nut (15). 
A battery terminal according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said notches (20A-2) 
are formed as a series of projections that are wave-shaped in cross section 

and continuous in the circumferential direction. 
A battery terminal as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein 
said clamping member (12) is a C-shaped member comprising a top (12a) 

and two sides (12b, 12c), said top (12a) being engaged by a member (14) of 
said urging means, said tapered sides (26a, 26b, 27a, 27b, 26a', 26b', 27a', 

27b') being formed in recesses in the middle portions of said sides (12b, 
12c).  

 
A battery terminal according to any of the preceding claims, wherein 
each of said folded arms is provided with two tapered walls of which one 

(21A-1, 21A'-1) is formed on the top portion (21A, 21A') of the folded arm 
and the other one (21B-1, 21B'-1) is formed on the bottom portion (21B, 

21B') of the folded arm, and said clamping member (12) has first tapered 
sides (26a, 27a, 26a', 26b') formed in a top portion thereof and second tapered 

sides (26b, 27b, 26b', 27b') formed in a bottom portion. 
A battery terminal according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said 
two folded arms (21A, 21B and 21A', 21B') are formed on a side of said ring-shaped 

post fitting members (20A, 20B) opposite to a wire connector portion 
(17) of the terminal body, and said clamping member (12) is adapted to be 

slid onto said folded arms from the free end thereof.
