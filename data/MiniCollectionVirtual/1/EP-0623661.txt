<ABSTRACT>
Water resistant emulsions for woodworking adhesives may be prepared using 
an emulsion polymer, the polymer being prepared in the presence of 1 to 2.5% by 

weight of 88% hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol and 1 to 4% by weight of 95-99.5% (or 
above) hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
Aqueous emulsions of N-methylol acrylamide - vinyl acetate polymers are
widely used in formulating wood adhesives wherein bond strength, fast setting,
colorless glue lines and ease of application are desired. Protective colloids
are often added to stabilize the emulsions against gelling during storage and to
improve water resistance. For these purposes, 88% hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol
is the most commonly used protective colloid. It is generally agreed that as the
degree of hydrolysis of the polyvinyl alcohol increases above 88% its ability to
perform as an effective protective colloid decreases leading to lower mechanical
stability of the final latex. This problem is accentuated by the presence of
water soluble resins such as resorcinol-formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde,
melamine-formaldehyde, or phenol-formaldehyde resins and trimethylol phenol
oligomer or with fusion aids, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol or ethylene
glycol diacetate which are generally added to improve water resistance and other
properties of these adhesives. These pre-formulated adhesives may then be
catalyzed with various acidic metal salts as is known in the art. These adhesive
systems are described, for example, in US-A-3,301,809; 3,563,851;
3,433,701; 3,041,301; 4,474,915 and 4,687,809.While such formulated vinyl acetate based adhesives provide adequate water
resistance for plywood and finger jointed lumber constructions tested at room
temperature, under vacuum-pressure soaks and in boiling water these vinyl acetate
adhesives do not meet ASTM standards for exterior lumber, especially ASTM D-3110
for edge glued lumber in general. This is illustrated by the requirements for
these tests on lumber, as well as the values obtained using conventional
formulated crosslinked polyvinyl acetate adhesives (PVA) on pine presented in the
table below.
