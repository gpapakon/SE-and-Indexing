<ABSTRACT>
A platinum complex comprising a cycloalkanediamine platinum (II) and, coordinated thereto, the carboxyl and/or sulfate 
groups of chondroitin sulfate mainly comprising the 4-sulfate. It is electrophoretically uniform, contains at most 5 wt. % of platinum, 

and has a solubility of 10 mg/ml or above in water at 20 °C. This complex is remarkably improved in water solubility and 
antineoplastic activity and has a high organ selectivity for the liver and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a platinum complex useful 
as an antitumor agent and an antitumor agent containing the 
platinum complex as an active ingredient. As a representative platinum complex having an antitumor 
activity, cisplatin has been known (Nature, 222, 385 
(1969)). Cisplatin has an excellent antitumor activity 
against solid tumor, but it has a problem that side effects 
such as nephrotoxicity, etc. are strong. In order to solve such a problem, platinum complexes having 
various leaving ligands have been synthesized. Also, compounds 
having saccharic acid such as glucuronic acid, etc. 
as said leaving ligand have been known (Japanese Provisional 
Patent Publication No. 44620/1979, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 7194/1988 and Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 66318/1991). Further, a cisplatinum (1,2-cyclohexanediamine) 
complexed with chondroitin sulfate has been known 
(Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 116221/1984). 
However, in these compounds, even though side effects are 
alleviated, antitumor activities are insufficient or side 
effects are not alleviated sufficiently. The present inventors synthesized platinum complexes having 
acidic polysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic 
acid, etc. as leaving ligands (carriers), and found  
 
that they had antitumor activities (Japanese Provisional 
Patent Publication No. 135201/1990). Among them, the platinum complexes having chondroitin 
sulfate as a leaving ligand use chondroitin sulfate 
(containing chondroitin-6-sulfate as a main component) 
obtained from cartilages of a shark, and have platinum 
contents of about 20 % (w/w) or more and low solubilities 
in water (1 mg/ml or less). Further, these platinum 
complexes have low antitumor effects, low organ selectivities, 
high release rates of the platinum complexes into 
physiological saline (it is estimated that half-times in 
blood are short) and potent toxicities as compared with the 
platinum complexes having hyaluronic acid as a leaving 
ligand. On the other hand, as to the platinum complex disclosed in 
Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 116221/1984 
described above, derivation of chondroitin sulfate to be 
used is not described, its platinum content is as high as 
about 10 to 16 %, and the antitumor effect of said platinum 
complex is not described at all. The present invention has been made for the purpose of 
solving the above problems of conventional platinum complexes 
having, as a leaving ligand, acidic polysaccharide, 
particularly
