<ABSTRACT>
In a spot-knocking treatment for a cathode ray 
tube, a discharge gap (50) for applying a high voltage 

pulse to an intermediate voltage electrode (15, 17) of 
an electron gun is provided on the outside of the cathode 

ray tube (10). A high voltage is applied to the 
intermediate voltage electrode (15, 17) by utilizing a 

discharge occurring in the discharge gap (50). 
Therefore, deficiency of spot-knocking treatment for the 

cathode ray tube can be overcome.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for spot-knocking 
an electron gun assembly of a cathode ray tube 
(CRT), which is performed after the CRT is assembled. In general, a CRT has an envelope composed of a 
panel having a phosphor screen on its inner surface, and 
a funnel formed continuous with the panel. An electron 
gun including a plurality of electrodes such a focus 
electrode and a final acceleration electrode is provided 
within a neck of the funnel. FIG. 1 shows an example of the structure of such an 
electron gun. The electron gun comprises a heater 11, a 
cathode 12 heated by the heater 11, a first grid electrode 
13, a second grid electrode 14, a third grid electrode 
15, a fourth grid electrode 16, a fifth grid 
electrode 17, a sixth grid electrode 18 and a convergence 
electrode 19. The second grid electrode 14 and 
fourth grid electrode 16 are connected within a neck 1, 
and similarly the third grid electrode 15 and fifth grid 
electrode 17 are connected within the neck 1. The 
heater 11 is supplied with a heater voltage. The first 
grid electrode 13 is grounded. The second grid electrode 
14 and fourth grid electrode 16 are supplied with 
a relatively low voltage of about several hundred V. 
The sixth grid electrode 18 is supplied with a relatively 
high voltage of 20 to 30 kV via a high voltage 
input terminal or anode button 20 provided on the funnel  
 
2, an internal conductor film 3 provided on the inner 
surface of the funnel 2, a bulb spacer 4, and the convergence 
electrode 19. An intermediate voltage of about 
28% of the voltage applied to the sixth grid voltage 18 
is applied across the third grid electrode 15 and fifth 
grid electrode 17. Accordingly, in this electron gun, 
the first grid electrode 13, second grid electrode 14 
and fourth grid electrode 16 constitute low voltage-side 
electrodes, the third grid electrode 15 and fifth grid 
electrode 17 constitute intermediate voltage-side 
electrodes, and the sixth grid electrode 18 constitutes 
a high voltage-side electrode as a final acceleration 
electrode. Conventionally, the CRT is subjected to a spot-knocking 
process to improve a withstanding voltage of an 
electron gun assembly, after it has been assembled. In 
the spot-knocking process or treatment, an electric discharge 
is caused among a plurality of electrodes of the 
electron gun and the surfaces of the electrodes are 
treated. In the spot-knocking process, in general, a 
sufficient spot-knocking treatment can be performed on 
the fifth grid electrode 17 of
