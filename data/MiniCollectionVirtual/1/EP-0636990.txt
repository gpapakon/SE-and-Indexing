<ABSTRACT>
A computer for implementing an algorithmic method for 
extracting iconic/symbolic information from image data in a 

parallel processing environment is disclosed. A register (110) 
is associated with each of a plurality of processing elements 

(PE) in a lower level processing, and the iconic/symbolic image 
data is transferred to a higher level processing, over data 

buses (F1, F2) linking the two levels of the processing, based 
on the condition of the register (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the following U.S. 
Patents: U.S. Patent No. 4,809,346 issued February 28, 1989 
entitled "Computer Vision Architecture for Iconic to Symbolic 
Transformation"; U.S. Patent No. 4,809,347 issued February 28, 
1989 entitled "Computer Vision Architecture"; and, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,901,360 issued February 13, 1990 entitled "Gated 
Architecture for Computer Vision Machine", all of which are 
assigned to Hughes Aircraft Company, the assignee of the 
present invention. This invention relates in general to computer vision or 
image understanding machines and, more particularly, to 
computer architectures and methods capable of both arithmetic 
or iconic and symbolic processing of image data. There exists a need for a computer system that is capable 
of both arithmetic or iconic and symbolic processing of image 
data which is designed specifically for use in computer vision 
research and analyses efforts. Such a system can be used in 
a variety of different applications such as for use in real 
time processing of data from radar, infrared and visible 
sensors in areas such as aircraft navigation and 
reconnaissance. Another application of such a machine would 
be as a development system for use in vision laboratories in 
the implementation and simulation of many computationally  
 
intensive algorithms. Machines which are capable of operating on image data (as 
compared to merely arithmetic data) are referred to 
alternatively as image processors, vision computers, image 
understanding machines and the like. Image understanding 
machines are sometimes thought of as a higher level machine 
than an image processor which is typically referred to as a 
machine for enhancing and classifying images whereas an image 
understanding machine involves the automatic transformation of 
the image to symbolic form, effectively providing a high level 
description of the image in terms of objects (i.e., a 
connected set of pixels containing information), their 
attributes, and their relationship to other objects in the 
image. The present invention is directed to this latter type 
of machine (although it can do the lower level tasks as well) 
and shall be referred to as an image understanding machine. It is generally recognized that a high level image 
understanding machine must be capable of performing two basic 
types of computations: arithmetic or iconic processing and 
symbolic manipulation. Thus, it would be desirable to provide 
an image understanding machine that is capable of performing 
a
