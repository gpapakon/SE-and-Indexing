<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a
ubiquinone in the manufacture of a medicament for
administration to a patient treated with
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or an analog thereof in an
amount effective to combat heart failure induced by said
DHEA or analog thereof and to pharmaceutical formulations
comprising DHEA and ubiquinone.DHEA is a naturally occurring steroid
secreted by the adrenal cortex with apparent
chemoprotective properties. Epidemiological research
has shown that low endogenous levels of the natural
steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) correlate with
increased risk of developing some forms of cancer, such
as premenopausal breast cancer in women and bladder
cancer in both sexes. R.D. Bulbrook et al., Lancet2,
395-398 (1971); B. Zumoff, et al., Cancer Res.41,
3360-3363 (1981) ; G.B. Gordon, Cancer Res.51, 1366-1369
(1991) ; K.J. Helzlsouer, Cancer. Res.52, 1-5
(1992). The ability of DHEA and DHEA analogs to
inhibit carcinogenesis is believed to result from their 
uncompetitive inhibition of the activity of the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).G6PHD is the rate limiting enzyme of the
hexose monophosphate pathway, a major source of
intracellular ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH. P.A. Marks
et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA46, 447-452 (1960).
Ribose-5-phosphate is a necessary substrate for the
synthesis of both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides
required for the synthesis of RNA and DNA. NADPH is a
cofactor also involved in nucleic acid biosynthesis and
the synthesis of hydroxmethylglutaryl Coenzyme A
reductase (HMG CoA reductase). S. Schulz et al.,
Inhibition of Protein Isoprenylation and p21ras
Membrane Association by DHEA in Human Colonic
Adenocarcinoma Cells in Vitro, Cancer Res. (Dec. 15,
1991).HMG CoA reductase is a very unusual enzyme in
that it requires two moles of NADPH for each mole of
product, mevalonate, produced. Thus, it appears that
HMG CoA reductase would be ultrasensitive to DHEA-mediated
NADPH depletion, and that DHEA-treated cells
would rapidly show depletion of intracellular pools of
mevalonate. Mevalonate is required for DNA synthesis,
and DHEA arrests human cells in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle in a manner closely resembling that of the
direct HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin. S.

Cell Cycle Arrest in Human Colonic Adenocarcinoma Cells
