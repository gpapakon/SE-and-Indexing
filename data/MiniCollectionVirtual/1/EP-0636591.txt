<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cementitious composition for the
cementation of oil wells, which is able to prevent
fluid migration.Fluid migration is a known phenomenon manifested as the migration
of gas into the cemented interspace in a well when the
well passes through a pocket of gas under pressure. In
particular, this migration occurs during the setting of the
cementitious composition injected between the well wall and the
lining pipe, when the hydrostatic pressure of the cement column is
unable to balance the gas pressure. Under these circumstances the
gas migrates through the cement or into the space between the
cement and the well walls, to create a multiplicity of channels
which may reach the well surface. Fluid migration is also
accentuated by contraction of the cement and possibly by loss of
liquid from the cementitious composition by filtration into the
surrounding formation, especially if porous.In conclusion, fluid migration can lead to weakening of the
cement, to reduced productivity and to surface safety problems.
To minimize fluid migration, the known art uses the addition of 
particular additives to the cement mortars, and more specifically
surfactants (US patent 3,926,257), silica (US patents 4,993,031,
5,149,370 and Re. 32,742) and polymer lattices (US patents
4,537,918, 4,721,160 and 4,767,460). In particular, with the
diffusing gas the surfactants should produce a foam able to form a
barrier to further gas diffusion. In the case of polymer
lattices, at adequate temperature these should form a gelatinous
film which hinders gas movement. Finally, silica in microparticle
form acts by filling the voids left by the cement granules, which
are of larger particle size, so again hindering gas movement.These are however relatively costly materials, the effectiveness
of which is not always completely satisfactory. In particular,
silica is not completely inert to water and consequently reduces
the quantity of water available for cement hydration.It has now been found that the addition of carbon black to
cementitious compositions used for oil well cementation results in
a number of unexpectedly good advantages. It has been found in
particular that the addition of carbon black completely or
substantially completely prevents fluid migration. It also acts
in itself as a filtrate reducer with improved activity compared
with formulations using silica. Having no pozzolanic properties,
the carbon black can be added to the cement and water mixture
without reducing the quantity of water available for
