<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus useful for procedures in growing
cells or tissue culture in vitro and more particularly for supporting, positioning
and/or centering cell culture inserts that are used in the procedures.Culture vessels are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,495,289 and
5,026,649 and European Patent Application No. 0 483 620 A2. Culture
vessels comprise wells which generally have a circular shape and size which
permits the introduction therein of a cell culture insert having a membrane upon
which cell attachment, growth and differentiation occur. The culture vessels
containing the wells are typically rectangular and have a standard size in order
to accommodate standard analytical apparatus.Conventional cell culture inserts used in culture vessels are described
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,871,674 and 5,026,649. U.S. Patent No. 4,871,674
discloses a cell culture insert which comprises discontinuous projecting parts
for hanging the cell culture insert on an upper circumferential part of the
culture vessel. U.S. Patent No. 5,026,649 discloses a cell culture insert which
comprises a projecting part for hanging the culture cell on an upper
circumferential part of the culture vessel, and further includes openings in the 
sidewalls for exchanging gas and for pipeting sample.EP-A-0 239 697 discloses an apparatus for growing tissue
cultures in vitro, said apparatus comprising a culture
vessel and a cell culture insert suspended in a well of
the vessel. The insert comprises a circular flange resting
on a supporting surface of the vessel. The insert
comprises a permeable membrane forming the bottom surface
thereof. The insert may be rotated with respect to
the vessel. The insert comprises a cutout for introducing
a pipette to the wall of the insert into the culture
vessel.Although there are a number of culture vessels and cell
culture inserts commercially available and described in
patent publications, it is believed that there are no
culture vessels or cell culture inserts available that
can be used together to support, position and/or center
a cell culture insert without interfering with the growing
of tissue cultures in vitro.It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus
for use in growing tissue cultures in vitro which allows
for positioning cell culture inserts in such a way that
contamination is reduced.The apparatus of the present invention is defined by
claim 1.The apparatus preferably comprises a test plate including
an upper surface, a lower surface, and a plurality
of wells. Each

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in growing tissue cultures in vitro
comprising:


a culture vessel (15;15a;100) comprising an upper
surface (12;12a;104), a lower surface (13;13a;105),

a plurality of wells (14;14a;106) extending from said
upper surface (12;12a;104) to said lower surface

(13;13a;105), a raised mouth surface (24;24a) extending
from each said upper surface of each well,

and
a cell culture insert (40;40a) suspended in one
of said wells (14;14a;106) and comprising an upper

portion (48;48a), a lower portion (50;50a), a sidewall
(42;42a) comprising an inner (46;46a) and an

outer surface (44;44a) and extending from said upper
portion (48;48a) to said lower portion (50;50a), and

a permeable membrane (58;58a) attached to said lower
portion and a flange (54;54a),
characterized in that
the cell culture vessel (15;15a;100) has at least
one projecting portion (152;152a) extending from

said raised mouth surface (24;24a), said projecting
portion enganging with a slot (156) in the flange

(54;54a) of the cell culture insert (40;100).
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said cell culture
insert (40;40a) comprises two projecting portions

(152) located opposite from one another. 
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2 wherein said cell culture
insert (40;40a) further comprises two projecting

tabs (60;60a) for restricting movement of said cell
culture insert in said well (14;14a;106) of said

culture vessel (15;15a;100) extending from said outer
surface (44;44a) of said sidewall (42;42a).
The apparatus of claim 3 wherein said insert includes
two projecting tabs (60;60a) located opposite

one another on the outer surface (44;44a) of sidewall
and between said upper portion (48;48a) and

said lower portion (50;50a).
The apparatus of one of claims 1-4 wherein said culture
vessel (15;15a;100) is substantially rectangular

in shape and said wells (14;14a;106) are in an
ordered array of substantially parallel rows.
The apparatus of claim 5 further comprising a plurality
of cell culture inserts (40;40a).
The apparatus of one of claims 1-6 wherein said projecting
portions (152) of the wells (14;14a;106) are

in an ordered array to substantially prevent the
flange (54;54a) of one cell culture insert

(40;40a) from contacting the flange of another
cell culture insert.
The apparatus of one of claims 1-7 further comprising
a removable lid (70;70a) having a top wall (72)

and a peripheral skirt that extends from said top
wall. 
The apparatus of one of claims 1-8 wherein said cell
culture insert (40;40a) further comprises a

draft angle (A) from about 5 degrees to about 8
degrees.
The apparatus of claim 9 wherein said draft angle
(A) is about 6 degrees.
