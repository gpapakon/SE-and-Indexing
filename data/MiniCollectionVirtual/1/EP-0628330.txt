receptacle,
and a stand (4) with a rotary bearing, in which the holder
(2) is mounted so as to be rotatable by a rotary drive (5)

arranged outside the heating chamber (8),
the holder (2) extending from the outside into the heating
chamber (8) through the wall of the heating chamber (8),
and an outlet line (6) with a suction pump (39) for
drawing off vapour from the receptacle (3) being provided,

characterised in that the rotary axis (19a) of the rotary
bearing and the centre axis of the receptacle (2) have an

alignment deviating from the vertical and a gas rinsing
device (49; 49a) is provided for a transport gas flow (51)

crossing the receptacle (3), the outlet line (6) being part
of the gas rinsing device (49; 49a).
Rotary evaporator according to claim 1, characterized
in that the receptacle (3) comprises an axially parallel,

preferably hollow cylindrical circumferential wall (13).
Rotary evaporator according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the opening (3a) of the receptacle (3)

inside in a downwardly inclined direction, preferably

forming an angle of approximately 30 to 60°, more
particularly approximately 45°, with the horizontal.
Rotary evaporator according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the holder (2) is formed by a

hollow shaft (19) and the outlet line (6) extends through
the hollow shaft.
Rotary evaporator according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, in addition to being

connected to the suction pump (46) outside the heating
chamber (8), the outlet line (6) is also connected to a

condenser (41) or cooler and a collecting receptacle (42)
