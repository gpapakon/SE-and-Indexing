<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a small-sized electric motor 
equipped with an improved electric connector, which 

prevents high forces being exerted on exposed conductors 
(31) of an insulated wire (30) in the course of insertion 

or withdrawal of the exposed conductors from the connector 
housing (10), thereby preventing the rubbing between the 

exposed conductors (31) and the terminal contacts (17) of 
the electric connector. 
The electric connector includes an actuator (23). 
The actuator, when fully inserted in said connector 

housing, is adapted to push the exposed conductors (31) 
against the contacts (17) of the contact beams (16) of the 

terminals, thereby causing the contact beams (16) of the 
terminals to be forced into the exposed conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric 
connector terminals, electric connectors and an electric 
connector assembling method, particularly to an improvement 
in or relating to electric connector terminals and electric 
connectors designed to be integrally connected to blade 
terminals on electric machines and appliances. As is well known, required electric connections 
between the input terminals (or electrodes) of electric 
machines and appliances such as small-sized electric motors 
and associated electric power supplies or controls were 
made by soldering or crimping wires to the input terminals 
(or electrodes) of electric machines and appliances and to 
the conductors extending from the electric power supplies 
or controls. Such wire-soldered or wire-crimped connections, 
however, required laborious works, and still 
disadvantageously, connection to and disconnection from 
exterior conductors could not be performed with ease. United States Patent Number 5,287,028 proposed a 
connector housing integrally connected to an electric 
motor. The connector housing has an electric connector 
fitted therein with the inner terminals designed to be 
connected to the input terminals of the electric motor and 
the outer terminals designed to be detachably connected to 
the exterior lead wires extending from an associated power 
supply or control for making required electric connections  
 
between the electric motor and the associated power supply 
or control. In this prior art insertion of exterior 
conductors into the connector housing causes the terminal 
contacts in the connector housing to be resiliently 
deformed, thereby causing the resilient counter force in 
the terminal contacts to push themselves against the 
external conductors, thus making the required electric 
connection to the exterior conductors. If disconnection of 
the exterior conductors from the terminal contacts in the 
connector housing is desired, the exterior conductor must 
be pulled out from the connector housing against the 
contact force which is applied to the exterior conductors 
by the terminal contacts. The conventional electric connector, however, has 
the following disadvantages: First, both at the time of connecting to and 
disconnecting exterior conductors from the terminal 
contacts in the connector housing for external conductors 
must be pushed forward for insertion or must be pulled 
backward for disconnection against the contact force which 
is applied to the exterior conductors by the terminal 
contacts. Therefore,

<CLAIMS>
A small-sized electric motor equipped with 
an electric connector which permits electrical connection 

and disconnection of exposed conductors (31) of at least 
one insulated wire to said motor wherein the improvement 

comprises: 

said motor including a hollow cover (2) formed 
into a generally cylindrical shape and having at least one 

end having two elongated terminals (7A, 7B) passing 
therethrough and electrically connected to said motor, 
said connector including a dielectric housing 
(10) having openings adapted to receive said elongated 

terminals (7A, 7B) of said motor and a slot (13), 
communicating with said openings and located in a plane 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of said elongated 
terminals, adapted to receive said insulated wire (30) and 

an actuator (23), 
female terminals (14A, 14B), mounted in said 
housing (10) and having two mating ends, one mating end 

including a generally planar base portion (15, 20) that is 
transverse to the longitudinal axis of the elongated motor 

terminal, having an aperture (21A) formed in the planar 
portion to receive one elongated motor terminal (7A, 7B),  

 
said other mating end including a flexible arm 
(16) extending from said planar base portion bent to extend 

into the conductor receiving slot (13), and 
said actuator (23) adapted to be inserted into 
said slot (13) in both a partially inserted and a fully 

inserted position, said actuator, in said partially 
inserted position, defining a clearance in the slot (13) 

between the terminals and the actuator allowing the 
insulated wires (30) to freely pass into and out of said 

clearance and, in said fully inserted position, forces said 
exposed conductors (31) into contact with the bent flexible 

arms (16) of the female terminals extending into the 
conductor receiving slot (13) thereby making a good 

electrical connection between the female terminals and the 
cooperating respective exposed conductors (31). 
A small-sized electric motor equipped with 
an electric connector according to claim 1 wherein said 

actuator (23) has lock arms (27) integrally formed on 
opposite sides, each of said lock arms having a lock 

projection (28) adapted to be locked into a shoulder 
projection (29) on said connector housing (10) when said 

actuator is fully inserted in said connector housing slot.
