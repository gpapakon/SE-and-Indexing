<ABSTRACT>
If information is to be exchanged optionally in encrypted or unencrypted form between ISDN terminals (15, 16; 20, 21), that is to say terminals or telecommunication systems, assuming that the ISDN basic call procedures are available at the interfaces but supplementary service are not yet available everywhere, it will be the cryptographic devices, instead of the network, which will control the further setting-up of the connection after a phase initiated during the setting up of the connection, in which the network (14) has already established a connection between the calling and the called cryptographic device, the already existing B-channel connection being used for the mutual control, that is to say the D-channel procedures at the ISDN terminal interfaces being mapped onto B-channel procedures at the network interfaces, using an appropriate in-band coordination. The invention can be used in conjunction with the use of cryptographic devices in ISDN.

Method for exchanging information, selectively in
encrypted form or in unencrypted form, between ISDN

terminals (3, 5, 15, 16, 20, 21) having ISDN standard
interfaces with no special functions using basic call

procedures, where the calling ISDN terminal reaches a
particular intermediate connection state when setting

up a connection, in this state a calling key appliance
sets up the connection to a called key appliance across

the network and transmits necessary additional
information in-band, where the network has already set

up the connection between the key appliances but the
calling ISDN terminal, the called ISDN terminal and the

network are not yet synchronous in terms of their
connection states, and then the called key appliance

starts connection set-up to the called ISDN terminal,
with the additional information transmitted in-band

also being used,
characterized
in that
, after this phase of connection set-up, the two
key appliances control the rest of connection set-up

instead of the network, with the network being emulated
and the already existing B-channel connection being

used for reciprocal control by virtue of the D-channel
procedures on the ISDN device interfaces being mapped

onto B-channel procedures on the network interfaces
using in-band co-ordination,
in that
, for the in-band co-ordination between the 
signalling processes in the key appliances, the calling

and called key appliances allocate the respective B-channel
associated with their network interface for

transmission of the preceding signalling information
between the ISDN-terminal-end signalling processes,

which are defined by respective parameter pairs CEI/CR
on both sides, and later transmission of the user

information.
