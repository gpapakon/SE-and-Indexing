<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a non-contact image forming process in which a two-component type
developer containing a tuner an carrier particles having a coating layer comprising a magnesium compound is used.Heretofore, for a developer applicable to the image
formation in an electrophotographic system, two kinds of
roughly classified developers have been used, namely, a
single-component type developer and a two-component type
developer. Particularly among color developers, a two-component
type developer has been advantageous from the point
that a stable charging property can be secured.As the multicolor image forming processes in which the
two-component type developer is used, there have been two
known developing processes, namely, a contact developing
process characterized in making use of an intermediate image
transfer member and a non-contact developing process 
characterized in putting colors on a latent image carrier one
over another without making use of any intermediate image
transfer member. From the viewpoint that the process itself
can be miniaturized, the non-contact developing process has
been advantageous.However, in a simple non-contact developing process, a
developability is usually deteriorated as compared to the
contact developing process. JP OPI Publication No. 3-271753/1991
and so forth, therefore, overcome the above-mentioned
problem in such a manner that a developer layer is
made thinner to bring a distance between a latent image
carrier member and a developer carrier member (developing
roller) closer so that the electric field of a development can
be intensified.As a means for achieving an extreme thin developer layer,
there are the following known means; namely,
Item 1. a means for pressing a developer layer regulating
rod against the surface of a developing roller;Item 2. another means for regulating a developer layer by
bringing an elastic blade into contact with the surface of a
developing roller; andItem 3. a further means for regulating a developer layer
by keeping a specific gap between a non-elastic blade and the
surface of a developing roller.Among the means, the following means are effective to
form a layer having a stable layer thickness, namely; a means 
for pressing a developer regulating rod against the surface of
a developing roller, mentioned in item 1; and a thin layer
forming process carried out by making use of a rigid rod-type
magnetic member, that is proposed in JP OPI Publication No. 2-50184/1990 corresponding to EP-A-341 894.
However, when making use of the
