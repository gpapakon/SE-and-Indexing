<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal halide lamp 
used in general purpose illumination, optical appliances and 
others, an illumination optical apparatus combining a metal 
halide lamp and a concave reflector, and an image display 
system such as projection type liquid crystal display. Recently, the metal halide lamp has been widely applied 
for lighting at shops, roads, and for other general 
purposes, and its demand is also spreading as lights for 
automobiles, or light source for optical appliances. An 
example of metal halide discharge lamp is shown below while 
referring to drawings. Fig. 1 shows a structure of a single tube type metal 
halide lamp. In Fig. 1, numeral 1 denotes a luminous part 
of a discharge tube made of quartz glass, 2 is a tungsten  
 
electrode installed through a molybdenum foil 10, 3 is a 
sealing part tightly adhering the molybdenum foil 10, and 4 
is an external lead wire. In the metal halide lamp composed of these constituent 
elements, the operation is described below. In the metal halide lamp, the metal halide added in the 
discharge tube together with mercury and rare gases is 
melted and is present as liquid phase while the lamp is 
lighting at the inside wall of the discharge tube. The 
liquid metal halide is evaporated to be gas phase, and the 
metal halide vapor is dissociated into metal atoms and 
halogen atoms in the high temperature region of the arc 
column. The metal atoms are excited by the arc and emit 
their own characteristic spectral lines. Accordingly, as 
compared with the high pressure mercury lamps, the metal 
halide lamp is superior in luminous efficacy and color 
rendering properties. Metal halide lamps containing metal 
iodides such as Tl-Na-In, Sc-Na, Dy-Tl, and Dy-Nd-Cs are 
widely put in practical use. Metal halide lamps containing Dy-Gd-Cs, Dy-Tl-Cs, and Dy-Nd-Cs 
are known from EP-A-0 342 762, metal halide lamps comprising 
Dy-Nd-Cs are also known from EP-A-0 453 983. It is 
further known from GB-A-2 053 562 to add lutetium iodide 
to a metal halide lamp comprising indium iodide and an 
alkali iodide, in order to enhance the spectral output 
in the range of 320 to 340 nm. Generally, in the metal halide lamps, the luminous 
characteristic of the lamp is determined by the vapor 
pressure of the metal halides inside. So it is necessary to 
let the coolest-spot temperature of the discharge tube high  
 
enough to increase the vapor pressure of the metal halides 
in order to obtain the luminous characteristic of the metal 
halide additives. For
