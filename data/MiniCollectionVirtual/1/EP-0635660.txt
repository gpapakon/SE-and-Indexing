<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a control system (30) and a method for controlling the control elements (22) (clutches, brakes) of a vehicle power-shift transmission (20). The control system (30) contains a microprocessor which periodically executes an algorithm and which has a memory in which a sequential set of time reference values (TE(i)) and a sequential set of pressure guide values (PE(i)) are stored. During filling periods (Twake(el)), which are characteristic of the control elements (22), the control system (30) applies a filling-pressure pulse to each element (22) coming into operation. After the filling of the control elements (22), the control system (30) determines changeover time values (t(sft)), which are formed as a function of the filling period (Twake(el)). The control system (30) applies pressure signals to the control elements (22) at times which are represented by the changeover time values (t(sft)) and are characteristic of each element (22). Following a synchronis starting time (tr), the control system (30) determines synchronism changeover time values, which are equal for all the control elements (22). Following the synchronism starting time (tr), the control system (30) furthermore applies pressure signals to the control elements (22) at times which are determined as a function of the synchronism changeover time values.

<CLAIMS>
Control system for a vehicle power shift transmission 
having a plurality of hydraulic pressure-operated control 

elements by means of which, in order to shift the gear, 
the hydraulic pressure supplied to the elements is 

controlled, with means for applying to each oncoming 
element a fill pressure pulse for fill periods 

(twake(el)), which are unique for each element,
 
characterised by 


means for determining shift time values (t(sft)) 
subsequent to filling of the control elements as a 

function of the fill period (twake(el)), 
means for applying pressure signals to the control 
elements at times represented by the shift time values 

(t(sft)), the shift time values (t(sft)) being unique for 
each control element, 
means for determining, subsequent to a synchronous 
start time (tr), synchronous time values which are 

identical for all the control elements, and 
means by which, subsequent to the synchronous start 
time (tr), pressure signals are applied to the control  

 
elements at times which are determined as a function of 

the synchronous time values. 
Control system according to claim 1, characterised by 

a memory for storing a sequential set of time reference 
values (tE(i)) and a sequential set of pressure command 

values (PE (i)), each pressure command value (PE (i)) being 
allocated to one of the time reference values (tE(i)), 
means of comparing the shift time values (t(sft)) with 
one of the stored time reference values (tE(i+1)) and for 

selecting one of the stored pressure command values 
(PE(i)) in dependence of the result of said comparison, 

and 
means for applying pressure signals depending on the 
selected pressure command values (PE(i)) to the control 

elements. 
Control system according to claim 2, characterised in 
that there is provided a microprocessor-based system for 

controlling pressurisation of the control elements, by 
means of which, in order to shift the gear system, the 

hydraulic pressure delivered to the elements is 
controlled, with  

 

means by which, prior to application of a fill pressure 
pulse to a control element, an absolute time value 

(t(abs)) is increased and shift time value (t(sft)) is 
equated to the absolute time value (t(abs)), 
means by which, in dependence on a wake-up command, a 
base pulse time value (t(bp)) and an absolute time value 

(t(abs)) are periodically increased, and an increase in 
the shift time value (t(sft)) is prevented, 
means by which then, when the base pulse time value 
(t(bp)) is equal to a predeterminable wake-up time value 

(twake(el)), a wake-up flag is set, the absolute time 
value (t(abs)) is increased and the shift time value 

(t(sft)) is set equal to the absolute time value (t(abs)) 
plus a maximum time value (twake-(max)) and less the fill 

duration time value (twake-(el)), and 
means by which, after the wake-up flag has been set and 
the control element filled, the absolute time value 

(t(abs)) is increased and compared to a synchronous start 
time value (tr), and by means of which then, if the 

absolute time value (t(abs)) is smaller than the 
synchronous start time value (tr), the shift time value 

(t(sft)) is set equal to the absolute time value (t(abs)) 
plus the maximum time value (twake(max)) and less the 

fill duration time value (twake(el)), and, when the  
 

absolute time value (t(abs)) is not smaller than the 
synchronous start time value (tr), the shift time value 

(t(sft)) is set equal to the absolute time value (t(abs)) 
less the maximum time value (twake(max)). 
Control system according to claim 2 or 3,
 
characterised by 


means of updating one time reference value (tE(i)) by 
the next time reference value (tE(i+1)), when the switch 

time value (t(sft)) is not smaller than the one time 
reference value (tE(i)). 
Control system according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised by 


a memory for storing a sequential set of pressure slope 
values (SE(i)), each pressure slope value (SE(i)) being 

allocated to one of the time reference values (tE(i)), 
and 
means by which there may be applied to the control 
element a pressure which corresponds to a selected 

pressure command value (PE(i)) plus the product of a 
selected pressure slope value (SE(i)) and a time interval 

value (t(sft) -tE(i)). 
Method of controlling pressurisation of hydraulically 
operated control elements of a vehicle power shift 

transmission with the following method steps:

the sequential set of pressure command values (PE(i)) are 

stored, each pressure command value (PE(i)) having 
allocated to it one of the time reference values (tE(i)), 
b) prior to application of a fill pressure pulse to the 
control element, an absolute time value (t(abs)) is 

periodically increased and a shift time value (t(sft)) 
set equal to the absolute time value (t(abs)), 
c) in response to a wake-up command, a basic pulse time 
value (t(bp)) and an absolute time value (t(abs)) are 

periodically increased and prevents the increase of a 
shift time value (t(sft)), 
d) when the base pulse time value (t(bp)) is equal to a 
predeterminable wake-up time value (twake(el)), a wake-up 

flag is set, the absolute time value (t(abs)) is 
increased and the shift time value (t(sft)) is set equal 

to the absolute time value (t(abs)) plus a maximum time 
value (twake(max)) and less a fill duration time value 

(twake (el)),  
 
e) after the wake-up flag is set and the control element 
is filled, the absolute time value (t(abs)) is increased 

and compared to a synchronous start time value (tr) and 
then, if the absolute time value (t(abs)) is smaller than 

the synchronous start time value (tr) the shift time 
value (t(sft)) is set equal to the absolute time value 

(t(abs)) plus the maximum time value (twake(max)) and 
less the fill duration time value (twake(el)), and if the 

absolute time (t(abs)) is not smaller than the 
synchronous start time value (tr) the shift time value 

(t(sft)) is set equal to the absolute time value (t(abs)) 
plus the maximum time value (twake(max)), 
f) after each of the steps b), c) and d,) the shift time 
value (t(sft)) is compared to one of the time reference 

values (tE(i+1)) and the associated one of the stored 
pressure command values is selected from the memory, and 

a pressure is applied to the control element which 
corresponds with the selected pressure command values. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the present time reference value (tE(I)) is updated to 

the next sequential time reference value (tE(i)), when 
the shift time value (t(sft)) is not smaller than the 

first-named time reference value (tE(i)).  
 
Method according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that 


a sequential set of pressure slope values (SE(i)) is 
deposited in a memory, each pressure slope value (SE(i)) 

being allocated to one of the time reference values 
(tE(i)), and

which corresponds to a selected pressure command value 

(PE(i)) plus the product of the pressure slope value 
(SE(i)) and a time interval value (t(sft) - tE(i)). 
Method according to one of claims 6 to 8,
 
characterised in that, in response to a wake-up command, 

the fill pressure pulse is applied to the control 
element, and in that during application of the fill 

pressure pulse, a base pulse time value (t(bp)) and an 
absolute time value (t(abs)) are periodically increased 

and increase in the shift time value (t(sft)) is 
prevented.
