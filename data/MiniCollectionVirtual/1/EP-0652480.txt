<ABSTRACT>
In the inventive method of film strip preparation for repeat orders, the film strips (F) which belong to a customer order and in each case contain a number of numbered printing originals (masters) are fed into a preparation station. There, they are stuck onto a backing strip (carrier strip) (77) and wound up to form a roll of film which can be used in subsequent processing stations. The specific order data of the customer in terms of the desired number of prints of specific printing originals and, as the case may be, the desired printing format, are input by means of an input unit (11) in the preparation station and stored on a carrier medium (13) which is compatible with the subsequent processing stations. In this process, the specific order data of the customer are input before the film strips (F) are fed in. Before the film strips (F) which have been fed in are stuck onto the backing strip (77), their position parallel to the transport direction (D) and the sequence of numbers of the printing originals on the respective film strip (F) are automatically examined and by comparison with the input specific order data of the customer it is checked whether the film strip which has been fed in is necessary to carry out the customer's order. In the event of a faulty position of a film strip (F) and/or in the event of a film strip (F) which is not needed in order to carry out the order, the operating staff are automatically alerted to the respective fault and/or the respective film strip (F) is removed automatically before it is stuck onto the backing strip (77). The inventive device has an input region (4) for the film strips (F), which input region is equipped, in front of a pair (41, 42) of feed rollers, with at least one photoelectric sensor (49) and which has downstream of the pair (41, 42) of feed rollers a photoelectric scanning device (48) for the numbers of the originals.

Process for preparing film strips for repeat orders in which film strips (F) belonging to a
customer's order, and which respectively contain a plurality of numbered copying

originals (N), are fed into a preparation station (1), are bonded onto a carrier strip (77)
and are coiled up to form a film roll (8) which can be inserted at subsequent processing

stations, and in which order data specific to the customer with respect to the desired
number of copies of certain copying originals (N) and, if appropriate, of the desired

copying format are input via an input unit (11) into a computer unit (10) connected to
the preparation station (1) and are stored as a device table on a storage medium (13)

which is compatible with the subsequent processing stations, characterised in that the
order data specific to the customer are input before the film strip (F) is inserted, in that

the inserted film strips (F) are investigated automatically before the bonding onto the
carrier strip (77) with respect to their position parallel to the transport direction (D),

with respect to the correct position of the coating side of the film strip (F) and with
respect to the numerical sequence of the copying original (N) on the respective film strip

(F), and in that a check is carried out by means of a comparison with the input order
data specific to the customer to see whether the film strip (F) inserted is necessary for

the processing of the customer's order, and in that in the case of an erroneous position of
the film strip (F) or in the case of a film strip (F) which is superfluous for the processing

of the order, the attention of the operating personnel is attracted or the relevant film
strips (F) are automatic
ally ejected before it is bonded onto the carrier strip (77). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that a check is carried out to see whether
the film strip (F) is located offset to one side or obliquely in the transport plane (T) and

whether the coating side of the film strip (F) is correctly located.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the numerical sequence of the
copying originals (N) on each film strip (F) is determined with the aid of at least one

photoelectric scanning device (48).
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that the respectively first copying original
number at least is determined on an inserted film strip (F) by means of the photoelectric

scanning device (48).
Process according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that in order to determine the
numerical sequence of the copying originals (N) on a film strip (F), the number, which is

contained coded in a so-called DX code, of the first adjacent copying original on the
respective film strip is read with the aid of a DX code reader (48), in that a conclusion is

drawn from the legibility of the DX code with respect to the correct location of the film
strip (F), in that a record is made of the longitudinal side of the film strip (F) on which

the DX code is found and as to whether a start or a stop sequence is read first and, from
this information, a conclusion is drawn with respect to the correct position of the

coating side, in that the information on whether the numerical sequence is increasing or
decreasing is determined from the presence of a start or stop sequence before the

reading of the coded copying original number, and in that the numbers of the rest of the
copying originals (N) located on the relevant film strip (F) are determined by means of a

previously occurring length determination of the relevant film strip (F). 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in that the length of the film strip (F) is, on
the one hand, determined by detection of the revolutions of a pair of film draw-in rollers

(41, 42), which pair is arranged directly in the input region (4) of the preparation station
(1) and, on the other hand, by detection of the rear end of the film strip (F).
Process according to Claim 6, characterised in that the rear end of the film strip (F) is
specified by at least one photoelectric detector (49) which is arranged in the insertion

region (4) of the preparation station (1) at a specified distance from the pair of draw-in
rollers (41, 42).
Process according to one of the previous claims, characterised in that a film strip (F) is
placed in position in such a way that it activates a sensor (49) arranged directly in front

of a pair of draw-in rollers (41, 42) and, depending on the length of the film strip (F), at
least one further photoelectric sensor (50 and/or 51) is activated, which sensor is

arranged in the insertion region (4) of the preparation station (1) parallel to the transport
direction (D) of the film strip (F) and at a specified distance from the first sensor (49),

in that the activation of the first sensor (49) puts into operation a drive (40) for the pair
of draw-in rollers (41, 42) and, if appropriate, for further pairs of transport rollers (43,

44; 45, 46),

in that the film strip is pushed forward by hand sufficiently far for its leading edge to be
gripped by the pair of draw-in rollers and that the film strip is automatically drawn

further in,
in that the rotation of the mating roll (42) of the pair of draw-in rollers (41, 42) is
measured by a revolution sensor (47), preferably by an angle encoder, in order to

measure, by this means, the path distance which the film strip (F) has traversed, 
in that with the aid of a photoelectric scanning device (48) which, viewed in the
transport direction (D) of the film strip (F), is arranged behind the pair of draw-in rollers

(41, 42), the advancing leading edge of the film strip (F) is detected and a DX code
arranged to the side of the first copying original (N), with a start and stop sequence and

with a coded original number, is read,
in that conclusions are drawn from the legibility of the DX code about the correct
position of the film strip (F),
in that the position of the coated side of the film strip (F) is determined from the position
of the DX code and from the sequence of the appearance of the start sequence and the

stop sequence,
in that if the start sequence of the DX code becomes adjacent before the coded copying
original number, it is concluded that there is an increasing numerical sequence and, if the

stop sequence of the DX code becomes adjacent before the coded copying original
number, it is concluded that there is a reducing numerical sequence,
in that on detection of the rear end of the film strip (F), the length of the film strip (F) is
determined from the distance of the corresponding sensor (49 or 50 or 51) from the pair

of draw-in rollers (41, 42) and the detected revolutions of the mating roller (42) of the
pair of draw-in rollers,
in that the numbers of the copying originals located on the film strip (F) are determined
from the film length and the information about the increase or decrease of the numerical

sequence of the copying originals (N),
in that using the previously specified device table, a decision is automatically made on
whether copies are desired from the adjacent copying original (N) on the relevant film

strip (F), 
in that if this is the case and assuming that the film strip (F) has been correctly inserted
and its coated side is correctly present, the relevant film strip (F) is transported on to the

deflection pair of rollers (71, 72) by means of which an adhesive strip (7) and a paper
strip (77) are guided, which are bonded together in such a way as to form a carrier strip

(77),
in that the outermost edge of the film strip (F) is held between the strips, and
in that in the case of an erroneous position of the film strip (F) or if it is found that the
film strip (F) is not required for the processing of the order, this film strip (F) is

automatically re-ejected by reversal of the direction of rotation of the pair of draw-in
rollers (41, 42) and, if appropriate, further pairs of transport rollers against the insertion

direction (D) or is removed from the preparation station (1) by means of an alternative
transport path.
