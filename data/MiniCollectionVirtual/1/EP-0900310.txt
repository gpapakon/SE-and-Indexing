<ABSTRACT>
A programmable cylinder lock comprising, in a stator (1) and a rotor (9), mechanisms (16-34) intended to allow, through a change operation, adapting the lock to a key different from a key (C) to which the lock itself was formerly adapted, which lock further comprises in combination a masterization device with at least one locking pin (45) or locking counter-pin (46) which is subdivided in two or more sections, suitable for being displaced to an opening position by action of two or more keys (C) having different shapes, thus allowing to provide master keys, possibly arranged on more than one level. Preferably the lock includes an elastic fork-shaped ring (39) housed in its stator (1) and co-operating with the rotor (9) in order to limit, during the change operation, the free section of a keyhole (10), whereby only specific keys (C) having a special shape are allowed to be taken out from the keyhole (10) in the change position, thus allowing reprogramming the lock. The lock may further include pins (49) of very hard material inserted in the lock rotor (9) in order to prevent the effraction by means of drills or similar tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a programmable cylinder lock which comprises
devices intended to allow, through a change operation, adapting the lock to a
key different from a key to which the lock was formerly adapted.Through the present description, the word "lock" is intended to designate,
in addition to the usual locks for doors or leaves, also any kind of special
locks, such as padlocks and others.Various embodiments of cylinder locks suitable to behave in the above
stated manner are known, and among them there is, in particular, the lock according
to the European Patent No. 0,226,252. In the following, through the
present description reference is made to programming mechanisms substantially
conforming the mechanisms of said European Patent, but it should be
realized that the present invention is not limited to the use of such mechanisms,
and it may also be applied to cylinder locks using different programming
mechanisms (See also US-A-5 000 019).There are also known masterizable locks which, thanks to the use of
locking pins subdivided in two or more sections, may be operated both by an
individual key singularly adapted to a specific lock, and by one or more other
keys, called master keys, which may also operate other locks, each one of
them being also operable by an individual key. This allows to establish within
a group of locks a hierarchy on two or more levels, whereby each lock may be
operated by its own key, which cannot operate the other locks of the group, as
well as by a master key, which is capable of operating all the locks of the
group, and possibly also by one or more other master keys of lower level,
each one adapted to operate all the locks of a specific sub-group, but not the
locks of the other sub-groups being part of the whole lock group taken in consideration.However, in the known embodiments, the programmable cylinder locks
cannot be provided with master keys, whereas the cylinder locks provided with
master keys are not suitable for being programmed.A first object of the present invention is to provide a programmable 
cylinder lock which, in addition, may be provided with master keys. Another
object of the invention is to provide such a programmable cylinder lock provided
with master keys, which may be industrially manufactured in a profitable
way. Still another object of the invention is to provide such a programmable
cylinder lock provided with master keys, which should have particular features
of mechanical strength and resistance against effraction attempts. A further

<CLAIMS>
A programmable cylinder lock, comprising a stator (1), a cavity (2)
provided in said stator, a rotor (9) having a keyhole (10), inserted in said stator

cavity (2), a programming mechanism (16-34) intended to allow, through a
change operation, adapting the lock to a key different from a key (C) to which

the lock was formerly adapted, and at least one locking pin (45) or counter-pin
(46) which is subdivided in two or more sections and is suitable for being displaced

to an opening position by action of two or more keys (C) having different
shapes, 
characterized in that
 the programming mechanism (16-34) includes,
in said stator (1), at least one longitudinally extending groove (3)

formed in said cavity (2), a possible set of stator seats (8) and locking counter-pins
(31) and springs (32) housed in said stator seats (8), and includes, in said

rotor (9): a set of first seats (12) which intersect said keyhole (10), and a set
of second seats (13) parallel to said first seats (12), as well as a first slit (14)

and a second slit (15), perpendicular to said seats (12, 13) and parallel to the
rotor axis (0), a set of key followers (16) inserted and longitudinally and transversally

movable within said first rotor seats (12) in order to co-operate with
the teeth of a key (C) inserted in said keyhole (10), each key follower (16)

having on one edge a number of projections (17), having on the opposite edge
a slidable joint member (18) and having an associated spring (19); a set of

locking pins (20) slidably inserted in said second rotor seats (13), corresponding
to said locking counter-pins (31) of the stator and having a number

of first recesses (21) facing said projections (17) of the key followers (16), and
one or more second recesses (22) directed opposite said key followers (16); a

stop bar (23) inserted in said first orthogonal rotor slit (14), having projections
(24) facing said second recesses (22) of the locking pins (20) and a uninterrupted

projection (25) extending in the opposite direction, suitable for co-operating
with a stator groove (3); first springs (26) associated with said stop

bar (23) in order to push the same outwardly; a translation bar (27), inserted 
in said second orthogonal rotor slit (15), having slidable joint members (28)

suitable for engaging said slidable joint members (18) of the key followers
(16), and a uninterrupted projection (29) extending in the opposite direction,

suitable for co-operating with a stator groove (3); and second springs (30) associated
with said translation bar (27) in order to push the same outwardly;

said parts being mutually co-ordinated in such a way, that said projections (24)
of the stop bar (23) engage said second recesses (22) of the locking pins (20)

when the uninterrupted projection (25) of the stop bar (23) does not register
with a stator groove (3), and disengage therefrom when a stator groove (3)

allows the stop bar (23) to displace outwardly under action of said first springs
(26), whereas the projections (17) of said key followers (16) engage corresponding

recesses (21) of the locking pins (20) when the uninterrupted projection
(29) of the translation bar (27) does not register with a stator groove (3),

and disengage therefrom when a stator groove (3) allows the translation bar
(27) to displace outwardly under action of said second springs (30) by dragging

the key followers (16) due to the respective slidable joint members (28,
18) mutually engaged; whereby said translation bar (27), when it registers with

a stator groove (3), is displaced outwardly by dragging the key followers (16),
these latter are disengaged from the locking pins (20) and then, in this position,

they allow replacing the key (C), thereby programming the lock in a manner
different from the foregoing one.

characterized in that
 the locking pins
(45) or locking counter-pins (46) subdivided in two or more sections are more

than one in number.
A lock as set forth in Claim 1,

into groups, which groups may be arranged in various manners within the lock. 
A lock as set forth in Claim 1, 
characterized in that

shape (line B) are allowed to be taken out from the keyhole (10) in the
change position, thus allowing re-programming the lock.
A lock as set forth in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it further includes
pins (49) of very hard material inserted in the lock rotor (9) in order to

prevent its effraction by means of drills or similar tools.
