<ABSTRACT>
A vehicular collision avoidance radar system using digital signal processing techniques including a transmit section (202) that generates a two channel transmit frequency. An antenna (210) both transmits the transmit signal and receives a reflected receive signal. A Schottky diode mixer (208) generates a difference signal having a frequency equal to the transmit frequency minus the receive frequency. A signal switch (304) in a front end electronics section (300) time demultiplexes and samples the channel 1 and channel 2 signals. The samples are coupled to a two-channel analog to digital (A/D) converter (310). A digital electronics section (500) receives the digital information and performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on each channel of digital data to determine relative speed and range of a target based upon the frequency and the difference in phase of the two channels. The digital electronics section also receives information regarding the status of vehicle operation and/or controls to determine the degree of danger presented by an identified target.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicular radar systems, and
more particularly to a vehicular collision avoidance radar
system using digital signal processing techniques.There is a continuing need to increase the density of
vehicles traveling the world's roadways, and
simultaneously to improve the safety of highway vehicle
operations by preventing highway vehicles from colliding
with stationary and moving objects (such as roadside
obstacles and other vehicles). One means for
accomplishing these seemingly contradictory goals is to
monitor the relative speed, direction of travel, and
distance between vehicles sharing the roadway, and to use
such information to provide direct indications to the
vehicle's operator of potential danger. It is becoming
increasingly more common for automotive engineers to
consider the use of microwave radar systems as a means to
monitor such environmental conditions.Vehicle borne radar systems which transmit and receive at
three different frequencies on a time division basis, with
two of the frequencies being used to determine range, and
the third being combined with one of the first two to
determine closing speed and likelihood of collision, are
presently known. One such system is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 3,952,303 to Watanabe et al., which teaches an
analog radar signal processing front end. However, analog systems such as the one disclosed in
Watanabe are sensitive to temperature changes, and are
difficult to calibrate. Furthermore, such systems are
dedicated to particular tasks, such as determining the
range and relative rate of motion of other objects, and
therefore are difficult to upgrade and customize to meet
varying requirements. Still further, the transmit and
receive frames in such three frequency systems can be
wasteful, in that only small portions thereof are needed
to determine the range and relative rate of motion of a
target, with the remaining portions of the frame being
unused.Another recent example of an automotive radar system that
-uses analog signal processing techniques to analyze
reflected radar signals is described in U.S. Patent
Application, Ser. No. _____, entitled Multi-Frequency
Automotive Radar System, and assigned to the assignee of
the present invention. In that system, a transmit signal
and the reflected received signal are coupled to an RF
mixer. The relevant output from the RF mixer is a signal
that has a frequency equal to the difference between the
transmit and receive frequencies. The frequency of the
reflected received signal may be shifted
