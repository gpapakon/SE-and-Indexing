<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a gauge and method for 
characterizing the surface venting of rollers. The gauge 

includes a smooth pliable saddle with a pick-up head 
positioned at a mid-point of the saddle. The pick-up head 

includes an opening which faces the outer surface of a 
roller when the saddle is draped over the roller. The 

roller's venting characteristics are determined by applying 
a vacuum to the pick-up head and measuring the equilibrium 

flow rate between the saddle and the outer surface of the 
roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
characterizing surface venting of rollers. More 
particularly, the present invention can be used to 
characterize the web-to-surface venting of a roller during 
the manufacture of the roller surface. Textured surfaces are used on web conveyance 
machine rollers to relieve the air that is entrained 
between the roller and the moving web. This allows the 
webs to be run at higher speeds while maintaining traction 
between the web and the roller surface. In the present 
invention a textured surface is defined as a surface which 
is three dimensional and includes interconnected plateaus 
or craters. Textured surfaces can also include rounded 
peaks and valleys. The conventional measurement method to determine 
the texture of a surface is to run a stylus across the 
outer surface at some position on the circumference. From 
this measurement a numerically estimated standard roughness 
parameter is determined. This parameter can be expressed 
as average roughness, RMS or 10 point, and from this 
measurement a characterization of the resulting traction is 
inferred. The main drawback of the stylus method is that 
the roughness values measured are representative of a small 
section taken from the tracing stylus and not of the whole 
surface. In addition, none of the estimated parameters 
provides true characteristics of the surface venting. 
Since surface venting is the most reliable way to determine 
the traction of the roller, the prior art off-line methods 
do not properly measure the roller characteristics. Even 
advanced optical measurement systems, which can show three  
 
dimensional irregularities, have the limitation of not 
being able to characterize the surface venting. Dynamic traction testing is one on-line method 
used to characterize surface venting of the surface of the 
roller. The other known on-line method is by measuring the 
air film thickness between two moving surfaces under 
various operating conditions. Both these methods require a 
web conveyance machine for the test to be conducted. These limitations of the prior art have resulted 
in difficulties in producing surfaces with consistent and 
repeatable traction and venting characteristics. This 
problem is illustrated in Figure 1 which shows results of 
surface venting characteristics of several rollers. All of 
the rollers met the specifications of the standard 
roughness parameter using the stylus method. The surface 
venting was then characterized through dynamic traction 
testing. It can
