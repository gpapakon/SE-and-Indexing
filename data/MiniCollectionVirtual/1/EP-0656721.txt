<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus having a printer interface 
and a recorder unit usable as a printer, includes an 

image memory for storing facsimile image data received 
during an operation as the printer, a key switch for 

switching an operation mode between a facsimile mode 
and a printer mode by a switching operation, and a 

controller for automatically causing the recorder unit 
to perform an output operation such that the image data 

stored in the image memory in the printer mode is read 
out to print received image information by the 

switching operation of the key switch to the facsimile 
mode when the facsimile image data is received in the 

printer mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile apparatus having a
memory reception faculty.A facsimile apparatus having a printer interface and a recorder unit
independently usable as a printer is known (document EP-A-0 519 253 discloses
such a facsimile apparatus). According to the facsimile apparatus of this type,
printing of an external data signal other than a facsimile image signal can be
independently performed.However, according to this document, when a printer is used for a
personal computer, a facsimile operation is not active. Accordingly, it is impossible
to received data through a line while the printer is used for the personal printer.Document AT&T TECHNOLOGY, vol. 4, no. 2, 1 January 1989, pages
12 to 17, licwinko, J.S. et al., 'AT&T Products and Services Speed the Written
Message' discloses memory means for temporarily storing income faxes.Document XEROX DISCLOSURE JOURNAL, vol. 18, no. 5,
September 1993 - October 1993, Stamford Conn., US, pages 491 to 492, Stanley,
M.R., 'Automatic Selectable Cover Sheet Avoidance for Network Printers' discloses
a process information printing technique.The apparatus and method according to the present invention
is defined in claims 1 and 5, respectively.The present invention has been made in consideration of the above
situation of a facsimile apparatus, and has its first object to provide a facsimile
apparatus capable of appropriately performing processing with a single operation
without any error when reception of facsimile information and printing of a recorder
unit are simultaneously performed. Its second object is to provide a facsimile
apparatus capable of grasping the time situation of processing facsimile information
without any extra operation when reception of the 
replenishment of the recording paper, the received data
can be read out from the image memory and printed.In the facsimile apparatus having the recorder
unit independently usable as a printer, facsimile
information cannot be received when the recorder unit
is used as the printer. An alarm is generated to
inform the sender that the apparatus is in use. For
this reason, urgent facsimile information cannot be
received, resulting in inconvenience.Additionally, in the facsimile apparatus having
the memory reception mode for temporarily storing the
received image data in the image memory upon reception
of facsimile image data, the facsimile image data
received during printing is recorded in the memory.
The received facsimile image read out from the memory
is output after the end of printing.

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus equipped with a printer interface (12) and a
recorder unit (8, 9, 56) usable as a printer, having a printer mode (S1, S11, S32) for

causing said recorder unit to print data sent from an external device connected via
said printer interface and a facsimile mode (S9, S16, S33) for causing said recorder

unit to print data received through a line (7) connected to a communication control unit (5), said
communication control unit being different from said printer interface,

   characterised in that it further comprises :

switching means (1, 31, 51) for switching between the facsimile
mode and the printer mode in response to a switching operation;
a memory (2, 53) for storing data received through the line while the
printer mode is set by said switching means; and
control means (1) for storing the data received through the line (7)
into said memory while the printer mode is set by said switching means, and

for reading out the data from said memory and causing the recorder unit to perform
printing operation of the read-out data when the facsimile apparatus is switched to the facsimile

mode,

   wherein said control means automatically causes the recorder unit to
perform the printing operation of the data received through the line when the

facsimile mode is set by said switching means.
A facsimile apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control
means automatically causes the recording unit to perform the printing operation of

the data stored in said memory in response to the switching to the facsimile mode
by said switching means based on a manual instruction (S19).
A facsimile apparatus according to either one of claims 1 or 2,
wherein said control means causes the recording unit to perform the printing

operation of the data stored in said memory in accordance with a print instruction
after the switching to the facsimile mode by said switching means. 
A facsimile apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, further
comprising display means (3), and wherein said control means causes said display

means to display information for prompting the output operation of the received data
by said recording unit during the received data is stored in said memory.
A method of controlling a facsimile apparatus equipped with a
printer interface (12) and a recorder unit (8, 9, 56) usable as a printer, said method

using a printer mode (S32) for causing said recorder unit to print data sent from an
external device connected via said printer interface and a facsimile mode (S33) for

causing said recorder unit to print data received through a line (7) connected to a communication control unit (5), said
communication control unit being different from said

printer interface,

   characterised in that it further comprises :

a first switching step (S34) for switching between the facsimile mode
and the printer mode;
a storing step (S39 to S42) for storing into a memory data received
through the line while the printer mode is set;
a second switching step (S34) for switching between the printer
mode and the facsimile mode;
a printing step (S44 to S47) for causing the recorder unit to perform
reading and printing operation of the data stored during the storing step, after the

second switching step.
