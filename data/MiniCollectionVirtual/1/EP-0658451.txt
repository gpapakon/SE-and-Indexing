<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tyre with a bread which has at least two tread areas running all around in the circumferential direction, which tread areas correspond in respect of their pitch number and pitch sequence. These two tread areas are rotated with respect to one another by an angle which can be calculated from the following formula:  (2n + 1) x 180/i if appropriate +/- 360 DEG /2P, i being the number of the order whose amplitude is mimimised, i
<
/=20, n
<
/=i-1, n being a natural number including zero and P being the total of the pitches in the tread area under consideration.

<CLAIMS>
Method of minimising low-frequency noise levels in 
the tread strip of tyres, the tread strip having at least 

two tread strip regions, which extend in the 
circumferential direction and are identical in respect of 

their pitch number and their pitch sequence, characterised 
in that the two tread strip regions are rotated relative to 

each other through a degree value, which can be calculated 
from the formula 


(2n + 1) x 180/i, possibly ± up to 360°/2P, 
 
over the tyre circumference, or respectively displaced 

relative to each other, in which formula i is the number of 
the order, the amplitude of which is to be reduced, i is 

≤ 20, n is ≤ i - 1, n is a natural number including zero, 
and P is the total number of pitches in the tread strip 

regions under consideration. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the number of the order, the amplitude of which is to be 

6minimised, is determined by measurement techniques or 
computer. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 

that i is ≤ 10. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the two tread strip regions have a 

total pitch number of between 40 and 80, more especially 
between 50 and 70. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the number of variable pitches in 

these two tread strip regions is at least 2, more 
especially between 3 and 5.  

 
Tyre, the tread strip of which is configured in 
accordance with the method according to one or more of 

claims 1 to 5.
