<ABSTRACT>
A surface treatment device comprising a 
swivel bearing mechanism, a swivel cylinder connected 

to the swivel bearing to be rotatable around 
the axial center of said swivel bearing mechanism and 

such that relative to the axial center one end thereof is 
located on an object surface side while the other end 

on a side opposite to the object surface side, a nozzle 
connected to one end of said swivel cylinder, and a 

rotating mechanism connected to the other end of said 
swivel cylinder for rotating said nozzle on its axis and 

around the axial center of said swivel bearing mechanism. 
The rotating mechanism comprises a main 

crank rotatably located on an axis passing through the 
axial center of the swivel bearing mechanism, a follower 

crank mounted on a position displaced from the 
axis of the main crank and having a rotating shaft having 

in turn an axis diagonally intersecting the axis of 
the main crank, and universal joint means for connecting 

a location displaced from the axis of the follower 
crank with the other end of the swivel cylinder. A 

main bevel gear is disposed on an axis common to 
that of the main crank, and a follower bevel gear is 

mounted on the follower crank so as to rotate together 
with the follower crank and to be in mesh engagement 

with the main bevel gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface
treating device capable of removing foreign matter,
such as an old coating or rust, stuck onto the
surface of an object, or of roughening the surface of
an object, by ejecting a high pressure fluid such as
water, or a high pressure fluid mixed with abrasive
grains, toward the surface of the object.The present invention also relates to a
surface treating device capable of removing foreign
matter, such as an old coating or rust, stuck onto
the surface of an object, or of roughening the
surface of an object, by ejecting a high pressure
fluid such as water, or a high pressure fluid mixed
with abrasive grains, toward the surface of the
object, while suction-adhering to the surface of the
object by the pressure of an ambient fluid such as
air or water and moving along the surface.So far, ultrahigh pressure water jet
equipment and sand blasting equipment have been put
to practical use as surface treating devices which
eject a high pressure fluid such as water, or a high
pressure fluid mixed with abrasive grains, toward the
surface of an object, such as an oil reservoir tank
or a ship hull, thereby removing foreign matter, such
as an old coating or rust, stuck onto the surface of
the object; or roughening the surface of the object
with the abrasive grains ejected, to make the surface
prepared for coating; or cleaning the surface of the
object to carry out non-destructive testing.The devices disclosed in the specification
and drawings of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,095,378 and 
4,934,475 are typical examples of a surface treating
device which ejects a high pressure fluid such as
water, or a high pressure fluid mixed with abrasive
grains, toward the surface of an object while
suction-adhering to the surface of the object by the
pressure of an ambient fluid such as air or water and
moving along the surface, thereby removing foreign
matter, such as an old coating or rust, stuck onto
the surface of the object; or roughening the surface
of the object with the abrasive grains ejected, to
make the surface prepared for coating; or cleaning
the surface of the object to carry out non-destructive
testing.Such a device capable of suction-adhering
to the surface of an object and moving along it has a
case, a surface sealing means mounted on the case and
defining a pressure reduction space in cooperation
with the case and the surface, and a pressure
reducing means for discharging a fluid from the
pressure reduction space to decrease the pressure
inside the pressure reduction space. The device can
be

<CLAIMS>
A surface treating device (2) having a nozzle (64)
for ejecting a surface treating material toward the

surface of an object, which comprises

a swivel bearing mechanism (60), an oscillating
tube (62) connected to the swivel bearing mechanism (60) so as

to be free to pivot about the axis center (P1) of the
swivel bearing mechanism and such that with respect

to the axis center (P1), an end portion thereof is
positioned on the side facing the object surface (F) and

the other end portion thereof is positioned on the
side opposite to the object surface, the nozzle (64)

connected to the one end portion side of the
oscillating tube, and a self-revolving/else-revolving

mechanism (100) connected to the other end portion side of
the oscillating tube (62) and making the nozzle (64) self-revolve

and else-revolve about the axis center (P1) of the
swivel bearing
 mechanism,
the self-revolving/else-revolving mechanism (100)
including a main crank (106) which has a driven shaft (104)

positioned on an axis passing through the axis center (P1)
of the swivel bearing mechanism (60) on the other end

portion side of the oscillating tube (62) and rotationally
driven by driving means, and which is rotationally

driven integrally with the driven shaft (104); a
subordinate crank (110) having a rotating shaft (108) mounted at

a site eccentric from the axis (L3) of the main crank (106) and
having an axis (L4) obliquely intersecting the axis (L3) of the

main crank (106); universal joint means (112) connecting a
site in the subordinate crank (110)

shaft (116) having an axis (L3) common to the driven shaft of

the main crank (106) and being disposed so as to be free to
rotate relative to the driven shaft (104), and which is

engaged with the subordinate bevel gear (114); and the
