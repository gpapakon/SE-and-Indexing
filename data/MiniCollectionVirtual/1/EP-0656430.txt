<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain a layer of mixed oxides on a 
substrate consisting of a plastic film (F), there is 

proposed a method in which an oxide tending to give off 
oxygen is evaporated from a first evaporating source 

(21), while a getter metal is evaporated from a second 
source (23). The latter metal deposits in the form of an 

oxide, absorbing the oxygen given off from the oxide 
evaporated in the first source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a plastic film having a dielectric layer deposited by vacuum
evaporation, and an apparatus for carrying out the said proces, according to the preamble of claims 1 and 7.It is known that the deposition of a layer of dielectric material, in particular of a metallic oxide, on a plastic film,
optionally in the presence of a metallic layer, imparts to the said film a high barrier effect, which renders it suitable for
use in, for example, the food packaging sector.The technique of vacuum deposition presents considerable problems from the point of view of the conditions of
evaporation (in particular in respect of maintaining high levels of vacuum in the deposition chamber), from the point of
view of the optical and aesthetic quality of the deposited layer, and from the point of view of the costs of the products
employed for the deposition.Currently, in order to obtain a product which provides a sufficient barrier to oxygen and to moisture and which at
the same time has a transparent appearance, silicon monoxide is employed. This material has the disadvantage of
being extremely expensive. Furthermore, the plastic film treated with silicon monoxide acquires a yellowish coloration.Silicon dioxide involves much lower costs but the film obtained does not exhibit the desired barrier effect.From EP-A-0 460 796 a method for producing a silicon oxide coating on plastic films is known wherein silicon
dioxide is deposited under vacuum on a polymeric substrate. The SiO2 coating is doped with a metal or an oxide.
Doping is claimed to increase the barrier properties of the substrate.EP-A-0 549 528 discloses a method for coating plastic film substrates, wherein two different oxides are evaporated
from one and the same evaporating source. The result is a co-deposition of the two oxides on the substrate.DE-A-4 113 221 discloses a polymeric film with coating of SiO2 or more generally of SiOx wherein x is between
1,5 and 1,9. In the latter case the starting material is SiO.A first object of the invention is that of proposing a process and an apparatus of vacuum deposition on a plastic
film, in which there is obtained a barrier effect superior to that obtainable with the conventional techniques.A further object of the present invention is that of providing a process and a corresponding apparatus which permit
obtaining a plastic film with a deposit of oxides which has the properties of transparency and absence of colour required
specifically for applications in the
