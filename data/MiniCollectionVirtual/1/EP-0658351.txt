<ABSTRACT>
Absorbent products and components for use in 
absorbent products are disclosed. These absorbent products 

comprise pressure-sensitive adhesive microfibers and 
thermoplastic polymer microfibers, that when incorporated 

into absorbent products provide good liquid transport 
properties, resiliency, and attachment systems; and further 

mask odors associated with bodily fluids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to absorbent products and
absorbent materials useful in the manufacture of absorbent
products, such as sanitary napkins, pantyliners, incontinence
devices, diapers, and to such related absorbent products.Absorbent products such as sanitary napkins and
diapers typically comprise an absorbent core, a liquid
impermeable backing material, and a liquid permeable facing
material. The impermeable backing material prevents the
bodily fluid from seeping out from the absorbent core and
staining the wearer's clothing. The absorbent core is also
covered with a facing material that, inter alia, also serves
to contain the absorbent core.Normally, absorbent articles, such as pantyliners,
sanitary napkins, baby and adult diapers, as well as other
adult incontinence devices, are formed by securing a liquid
impermeable film to an absorbent core and then attaching a
facing material to the impermeable film thereby securing the
absorbent core between these two layers (see, e.g., Datta,
et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,892,534).
This
process is both time consuming and expensive. Moreover, if
the facing is not in intimate contact with the core, the 
liquid on the surface of the facing will puddle up and not
penetrate through the facing but rather run off the surface.
This is highly undesirable behavior.It is also undesirable to have the absorbent
products move during use. The attachment systems presently
available often fail in this regard. During storage, the
attachment system's adhesive is covered with a release liner.
Polyethylene or silicone coated polyethylene paper is
frequently used on the liners. Current adhesive attachment
systems consist of continuous coating of pressure-sensitive
adhesives and a continuous silicone coating on a release
liner. Adhesives are normally thermoplastic rubber based and
hot melt coated, and are typically plasticized with oil. For
various reasons, the oil is an undesirable component of the
adhesive. It imparts poor holding properties to the adhesive
and tends to move in the system by migrating from the
adhesive to the film, which is quite undesirable. The
release liner on the attachment adhesive is normally silicone
or polyethylene coated paper. The resulting surface finish
of silicone coated papers is super smooth and the adhesive
contact is 100% with the release surface, which can be
problematic. Depending on the type of silicone coating, the
silicone release system may cause the adhesive to be too
easily released or too difficult to release, which is
undesirable. Thus, it
