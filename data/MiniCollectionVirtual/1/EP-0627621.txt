<ABSTRACT>
The device for examining the metabolism of cells has a carrier (53), which carries a pH measuring electrode (56), a control electrode (57) designed for proton exchange with the fluid, a reference electrode (58) and a counter-electrode (59) and, together with at least one other part, delimits a cavity for receiving the cells and a fluid. The electrodes (56, 57, 58, 59) are connected by means of electronic circuit means. In the case of an examination, the pH value of the fluid is measured with the pH measuring electrode (56) and the reference electrode (58). In addition, an electrical current is led through the fluid between the control electrode (57) and the counter-electrode (59) and controlled in such a way that the pH value of the fluid is maintained at a constant desired value, favourable for the cells, by means of proton exchange with the control electrode (57). In addition, the quantity of charge used during the measuring time for forming the current is determined, which gives a measure of the intensity of the metabolism and thus of the vitality of the cells.

A device for analyzing the metabolism of cells that border on 
a liquid, with pH sensing means (56, 58) for measuring the pH 

value of the liquid, 
wherein
 are provided a control 
electrode (57) which can be brought into contact with the liquid 

and is designed for proton exchange with the liquid, and a 
counterelectrode (59) which can be brought into contact with the 

liquid, and wherein the said pH sensing means (56, 58), the said 
control electrode (57) and the said counterelectrode (59) are 

electrically connected to electronic circuit elements, and 
wherein the said circuit elements are designed so as to generate 

an electric current flowing through the liquid between the said 
control electrode (57) and the said counterelectrode (59), and to 

measure this current and/or a variable associated therewith, and 
to control the current as well as the proton exchange in such a 

way that the pH value equals a desired preset value. 
A device as in claim 1, 
wherein
 the pH sensing means are 
provided with a pH measuring electrode (56), which can be brought 

into contact with the liquid and whose electric potential 
vis-a-vis the liquid is dependent on the pH value of the liquid. 
A device as in claim 2, 
wherein
 a supporting base (53) with 
an electrically insulating part is provided, and wherein the pH  

 
measuring electrode (56), the control electrode (57), and the 

counterelectrode (59) are provided with electrically conductive 
and/or semi-conductive layers applied on the electrically 

insulating part. 
A device as in claim 3, 
wherein
 the control electrode (57) 
encircles the pH measuring electrode (56) almost completely, and 

wherein the counterelectrode (59) is located outside of the 
control electrode (57). 
A device as in claim 4, 
wherein
 a reference electrode (58) is 
provided, which can be brought into contact with the liquid and 

which, together with the pH measuring electrode (56), is used for 
pH measurement, and which is also located on the electrically 

insulating part outside of the control electrode (57). 
A device as in any of claims 3 to 5, 
wherein
 the pH measuring 
electrode (56) and/or the control electrode (57) are provided 

with an oxide layer (66) of one or more metal oxides, which can 
be brought into contact with the liquid. 
A device as in claim 6, 
wherein
 the oxide layer (66) consists 
of at least one oxide of at least one of the metals iridium, 

palladium, zirconium, niobium, rhodium, tantalum, rhenium, 
platinum, and is monocrystalline, for example.  

 
A device as in any of claims 3 to 7, 
wherein
 the supporting 
base (53), together with at least one other part (71, 73) 

attached thereto, bounds a cavity (75) adjacent to the electrodes 
(56, 57, 58, 59) referred to above, the said cavity (75) 

preferably being sealed tight against its environment. 
A device as in any of claims 1 to 9, 
wherein
 the electronic 
circuit elements are designed so as to measure the amount of 

charge generating the electric current during a measurement 
period. 
A method for analyzing the metabolism of cells bordering on a 
liquid, in particular a method using a device as claimed in any 

of claims 1 to 9, whereby the pH value of the liquid is 
determined, 
wherein
 a control electrode (57) and a counterelectrode 
(59) are brought into contact with the liquid, and 

wherein between the said control electrode (57) and the said 
counterelectrode (59) a current is passed through the liquid and 

controlled such that the control electrode (57) will exchange 
protons with the liquid and the pH value will equal a desired 

preset value, and wherein the current and/or a variable 
associated therewith is measured.
