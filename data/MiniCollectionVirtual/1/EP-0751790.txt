<DESCRIPTION>
 SEROTONIN (5-HT-j RECEPTOR LIGANDS AND IMAGING AGENTSField of the InventionThis invention relates to novel compounds which display selective binding for serotonin (5-HT1A) receptors, to methods of preparing such ligands, to methods of utilizing them as imaging agents, and to novel compounds useful as intermediates in the preparation of such ligands.Government Support The work reported herein was supported at least in part by NIH NS-24538 and NIMH-48125.Background of the InventionNeural transmitters are chemicals in the brain that are used to send messages from one brain cell to another. Neurotransmitters bind to special' receptor proteins in the membrane of nerve cells, like a key in a .lock, triggering a chemical reaction within the cell. Serotonin (5-HT) is one form of neural transmitter.The serotonin system in brain is an important neurotrans- mission network regulating various physiological functions and behavior including anxiety and affective states. Serotonin has• been linked with depression and with other psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders, alcoholism, pain, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. One of the serotonin receptor subtypes, 5-HT1A, plays an important function as the 

 somatodendretic autoreceptor (presynaptic) in the dorsal raphe nucleus and as a postsynaptic receptor for 5-HT in terminal field areas.A number of agonists and antagonists for 5-HT1A receptors are reported in the literature (Hillver et al., " (S) -5-Fluoro- 8-Hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin: A Putative 5-HT1A-Receptor Antagonist [letter]", J.
