<ABSTRACT>
Endotoxin (Et) can be specifically assayed by 
exclusively utilizing the factor C system reaction without 

being affected by factor G contained in a limulus amebocyte 
lysate reagent. 
The present invention provides: (1) a reagent for ET-specific 
assay which comprises a limulus amebocyte lysate 

reagent and an alkylglucoside; (2) a method of specifically 
assaying Et in a specimen using a limulus amebocyte lysate 

reagent, wherein an alkylglucoside is added to the limulus 
amebocyte lysate reagent and/or the specimen; and (3) a 

factor G activation inhibitor composition which comprises an 
alkylglucoside as an active ingredient capable of inhibiting 

the activation of factor G in limulus amebocyte by (1→3)-β-D-glucan.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method for assaying endotoxin, a kit for
use in the assay method, a factor G activation inhibitor
composition each with the use of a limulus amebocyte lysate
reagent.There has been known a method for assaying endotoxin
(hereinafter sometimes referred to simply as Et) with the use
of limulus amebocyte lysate (hereinafter sometimes referred
to simply as lysate). This assay method is generally called
"limulus test" and the reaction of the lysate participating
in this assay is called "limulus reaction". Owing to the
high detection sensitivity, this method has been frequently
employed in various fields including pyrogen check of drugs
or water and clinical diagnosis. This method is based on
coagulation of the lysate in the presence of a trace amount
of Et. The latest biochemical studies have clarified that
this reaction consists of stepwise activation of several
coagulation factors [J. Protein Chem., 5, 255-268 (1986)].This reaction using a lysate obtained from Tachypleus
tridentatus will be illustrated with reference to Fig. 1.
When Et is added to the lysate, factor C (an Et-sensitive
factor, molecular weight: 123,000) existing in the lysate is
activated. Then the activated factor C thus formed limitedly 
hydrolyzes a specific site of factor B (molecular weight:
64,000) to thereby form activated factor B. The activated
factor B activates proclotting enzyme (molecular weight:
54,000) to thereby convert into clotting enzyme. The
clotting enzyme limitedly hydrolyzes coagulogen (coagulant
protein, molecular weight: 19,723) at specific sites (i.e.,
Arg18-Thr19 and Arg46-Gly47) in a loop crosslinked with a
disulfide bond. Thus a peptide C represented by H-Thr19---Arg46-OH
(consisting of 28 amino acid residues) is liberated
and the residual part is converted into a coagulin gel.
Thus, the limulus reaction is composed of a series of
reactions, which is also called a cascade reaction. (This
cascade reaction triggered by Et will be hereinafter referred
to as the factor C system reaction.)On the other hand, it has been clarified that the
lysate reacts not only to Et but also to (1→3)-β-D-glucan
(hereinafter sometimes referred to simply as β-glucan) in the
specimen. That is to say, factor G (a β-glucan sensitive
factor) shown in Fig. 1 is activated and the activated factor
G thus formed activates the proclotting enzyme into the
clotting enzyme to thereby form a coagulin gel. (This
cascade reaction triggered by β-glucan will be hereinafter
referred to as the factor G system reaction.)The
