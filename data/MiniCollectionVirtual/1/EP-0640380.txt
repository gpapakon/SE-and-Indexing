<ABSTRACT>
Nitrogen oxides are removed from an exhaust gas 
containing nitrogen oxides and oxygen in a proportion larger than its 

stoichiometric proprtion relative to unburned components in said 
exhaust gas, by (i) disposing an exhaust gas cleaner in a flow path, 

the exhaust gas cleaner comprising a first catalyst composed of 0.2-20 

parts by weight (on a metal basis) of silver or silver oxide 
supported on 100 parts by weight of a porous inorganic oxide, and a 

second catalyst composed of 1-50 parts by weight (on an oxide 
basis) of tungsten oxide and/or vanadium oxide supported on 100 

parts by weight of a porous inorganic oxide; (ii) introducing oxygen-containing 
organic compounds having 2 or more carbon atoms or a 

fuel containing said oxygen-containing organic compounds into the 
exhaust gas on the upstream side of the exhaust gas cleaner; and 

(iii) bringing the exhaust gas into contact with the exhaust gas 
cleaner at a temperature of 150-650°C, thereby causing a reaction of 

the nitrogen oxides with the oxygen-containing organic compounds 
to remove the nitrogen oxides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas 
cleaner for effectively removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust 
gas containing nitrogen oxides and an excess proportion of oxygen, 
and a method for removing nitrogen oxides with such an exhaust 
gas cleaner. Various exhaust gases discharged from internal 
combustion engines such as automobile engines, etc., combustion 
apparatus installed in factories, home fan heaters, etc. contain 
nitrogen oxides such as nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide 
together with an excess proportion of oxygen. The term "containing 
an excess proportion of oxygen" means that the oxygen content is 
larger than its stoichiometric proportion relative to unburned 
components such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrocarbons in 
the exhaust gas. The term "nitrogen oxides" means nitrogen 
monoxide and/or nitrogen dioxide. The nitrogen oxides are one of the causes of acid rain, 
posing a serious problem of environmental pollution. For these 
reasons, various methods have been proposed to remove nitrogen 
oxides from exhaust gases emitted from various combustion 
equipment. In the case of large, stationary combustion 
apparatus such as large combustion apparatus of factories, 
ammonia is employed to catalytically and selectively reduce  
 
nitrogen oxides in an exhaust gas containing an excess proportion of 
oxygen, thereby removing nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gas. However, such a method is disadvantageous, because 
ammonia is expensive, because ammonia is so toxic that the 
proportion of ammonia should be controlled by measuring the 
concentration of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and because 
this reduction system generally needs large apparatus. There has been proposed a method in which gases 
serving as a reducing agent, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, 
hydrocarbons etc. are brought into contact with nitrogen oxides, 
whereby the nitrogen oxides are non-selectively and catalytically 
reduced. In this method, the reducing agent must be added to the 
exhaust gas in a greater proportion than a stoichiometric proportion 
relative to oxygen in the exhaust gas to effectively remove nitrogen 
oxides from the exhaust gas, leading to an increased consumption of 
the reducing agent. For this reason, the method is applicable 
only to exhaust gas containing a small proportion of residual 
oxygen such as those generated almost under a theoretical air fuel 
ratio, resulting in limited application of the method to a narrow 
range of exhaust gases. There have also been proposed
