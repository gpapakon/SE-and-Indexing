<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for controlling and ensuring the quality of products made of concrete, such as moulded bricks, concrete bricks, paving stones or the like, which are manufactured continuously in a vibrating and pressing device by means of a mould and are conveyed off batchwise on pallets by means of a conveying arrangement to set in a store. For improved quality control, there is connected immediately downstream of the vibrating and pressing device (2) a measuring arrangement (7) which both carries out height measurements on individual moulded bricks (4) situated in a charge (8) and also performs a colour measurement on individual moulded bricks (4) situated in a charge (8). It has consequently become possible to sort out charges (8), which have not yet set and which lie above or below a predetermined set value, immediately after running through the measuring arrangement (7) and to supply them to the vibrating and pressing device (2) again, in order that only moulded bricks of given quality are supplied to the store to set.

<CLAIMS>
Process for assuring or monitoring the quality of
formed building units such as purpose-made bricks,

concrete blocks, paving stones, bricks, slabs or the like,
which are manufactured in a continuous process in a

moulding device (2), conveyed away in batches on a
conveyor (5) for the purpose of curing in a place of

storage, there being arranged directly downstream of the
moulding device a measuring arrangement (7), which carries

out measurements on individual freshly made products (4),
whereby the freshly made products (4), which are above or

below a specified set value, are sorted out as soon as
they have passed through the measuring arrangement and

returned again to the moulding device (2), and whereby the
measuring arrangement (7) can be used to regulate the

moulding device (2), characterised in that, with the
measuring arrangement (7), and in addition to the height

measurement, a colour measurement is carried out on
individual freshly made products (4) in a batch (8), a

high-resolution linear-array camera (11) measuring the
surfaces of the individual freshly made products (4) of a

batch (8) for their hue and brightness.
Process as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that
with the measuring arrangement (7), the height of the

freshly made products (4) is measured with at least two
installed laser diodes (9) and (10) in conjunction with a

high-resolution linear array camera (11).
Process as claimed in Claims 1 and 2, characterised
in that the height of the pallet (3) carrying the batch

(8) is measured by the laser diode (9) and the heights of
the individual freshly made products (4) are determined by

the laser diode (10), so that the height of the freshly
made product is determined from the resultant difference 

between the measured heights of the pallet (3) and the
freshly made product (4).
Process as claimed in Claims 2 and 3, characterised
in that, in addition to the laser diodes (9) and (10),

further lasers can be installed, which are used either for
height measurements or for checking the moulded contours

of the freshly made product (4).
Process as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that
the high-resolution linear array camera (11) splits the

surface signal from the surface of the individual freshly
made products (4) into the signals R (red), G (green) and

B (blue), in order to determine the hue, and into a signal
Y (luminance) to determine the brightness value.
Process as claimed in Claims 2 and 5, characterised
in that, in parallel with the height and colour

measurement, the high-resolution linear-array camera (11)
is used to identify the surfaces of the freshly made

products (4) in a batch (8).
Process as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims
1 to 6, characterised in that all of the individually

measured values of a batch (8), such as the height
measurement of the pallet (3), of the individual freshly

made products (4), the hue and brightness values and the
surface values are fed into a computer (12) and the said

actual values compared with stored and specified set
values (17).
Process as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that,
if the determining set values stored in the computer

regarding the quality of a batch (8) are exceeded, the
apparatus is switched off immediately in order to remove

from the conveyor (5) the as yet uncured batch (8), and
returned to the moulding device (2). 
Process as claimed in any one or several of Claims 1
to 8, characterised in that with the measuring arrangement

(7), the measurement values are recorded transverse to the
direction of conveyance, each of the freshly made products

(4), placed one behind the other in a batch (4), being
measured as it passes through the measuring arrangement.
Process as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that
a mean value is formed from the individual measured values

(16) in a batch (8) and compared with a specified and
stored set value.
Process as claimed in Claim 10, characterised in that
in determining the set value, tolerance limits of

plus/minus 5% are accepted.
Apparatus for implementing the process as claimed in
any of Claims 1 to 11 for assuring or monitoring the

quality of formed building units such as purpose-made
bricks, concrete blocks, paving stones, bricks, slabs or

the like, which can be manufactured in a continuous
process in a moulding device (2), conveyed away in batches

on a conveyor (5) for the purpose of curing in a place of
storage, there being arranged directly downstream of the

moulding device (2) a measuring arrangement (7), which
carries out height measurements on individual freshly made

products (4), characterised in that the measuring
arrangement (7) comprises at least two laser diodes (9,

10) and a high-resolution linear array camera (11)
arranged on a frame (18) above the conveyor (5).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 12, characterised in
that, with the line-array camera and in addition to the

height of the freshly made products (4), their colour may
also be measured in accordance with the process. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 13, characterised in
that the linear-array camera (11) and the laser diodes (9,

10) are horizontally arranged on the frame (18), such that
they can be moved into different positions.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 14, characterised in
that, in order to carry out fine adjustments to the

different positions, the laser diodes (9,10) and the line-array
camera (11) are arranged on slides (20, 20.1 and

20.2) which, with the assistance of a spindle drive
mechanism (21), are arranged in a manner which allows them

to be moved on a horizontal beam (22) of the frame (18).
Apparatus as claimed in Claims 12 to 15,
characterised in that the laser diodes (9, 10) and the

linear-array camera (11) are arranged in a plane
transverse to the direction of conveyance, the individual

laser diodes (9) and (10) being arranged at an angle (23)
transverse to the direction of conveyance, so that the

laser beams (24) fall onto the freshly made products (3,
4) to be measured in accordance with their angular

setting.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 16, characterised in
that one laser beam (24) is directed onto the pallet (3)

and that the second laser beam (24a) is directed onto the
freshly made products (4) lying thereon.
Apparatus as claimed in any one or several of the
preceding Claims 12 to 17, characterised in that the

measuring arrangement (7) is linked to a computer (12) to
evaluate the measured values as they are recorded by the

measuring arrangement (7).
