<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is disclosed for producing a band of generally rectangular cross section having at least two layers of material comprising means for advancing a first band along a predetermined linear path and means for guiding a second band into layered alignment with said first band including a roll (23, 32) around which said second band is partially wrapped prior to contacting said first band, the second band having an initial tangential contact position with said roll along a line on the surface thereof extending generally axially with respect to the roll, the roll being tiltable in a plane defined by the axis thereof and the initial tangential contact position of the second band, whereby the lateral take-off position of the second band may be controlled by tilting the roll so as to guide it into aligned juxtaposition with the first band to form a layered, substantially rectangular tow band.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for producing 
continuous lengths of layered material. The apparatus 
is capable of controlling the lateral position of the 
individual layers so they can be brought into 
predetermined lateral position with respect to other 
layers. The invention is particularly useful in the 
production of tows of filamentary material wherein 
individual bands of tow (sometimes called "ends") are to 
be layered in alignment with each other to produce a tow 
band which is rectangular in cross section. Although the apparatus according to this invention 
has broader applications with respect to aligning layers 
of continuously advancing material to form a layered 
assembly, it is especially useful in the production of 
filamentary tow for making articles such as cigarette 
filters. Accordingly, the invention will be described 
herein in that context. In the normal process for the production of 
cellulose acetate cigarette filters, as described for 
example in British Patent 909,940, cellulose acetate is 
spun through a spinnerette having, for example, 100-200  
 
orifices. The bundles of filaments or "ends" from each 
of a number of spinnerettes and their associated 
"spinning cabinets" are assembled to form a tow. This 
tow is normally composed of filaments of about 1.5 to 
about 10 denier and the denier of the tow is from about 
25,000 to about 100,000. The tow is then sent to a 
crimping device in the form of a flat band of, for 
example, 4 to 10 filament-diameters thickness. The 
width of the tow or band may vary considerably, 
depending on the number of ends combined. A typical crimper comprises a pair of nip rollers 
by which the tow is forced into a stuffing box against 
back pressure. This causes the tow to crimp. It is, of course, highly desirable that the tow 
inserted in the stuffer box be of uniform cross-section. 
Tow which is not uniform in cross-section results in 
nonuniform density within the crimping chamber (stuffer 
box) which causes nonuniform crimp, undesirable wear on 
the crimper rolls and parts and can produce edge defects 
in the tow band. The US-A-4,288,273 discloses an apparatus for producing a 
band in which a first band is advanced along a predetermined path 
and a second band is partially wrapped around the roll which is 
tiltable so as to guide the second band into aligned 
juxtaposition with said first band.  
 The present invention provides apparatus for 
arranging the ends in an orderly or regular fashion, 
i.e., of rectangular cross section to

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for producing a band of generally rectangular 
cross section having at least two layers of material comprising 

means for advancing a first band (10) along a predetermined linear 
path and means for guiding a second band (16) into layered alignment 

with said first band (10), said apparatus including a roll (23) around 
which said second band (16) is partially wrapped prior to contacting 

said first band (10), said second band (16) having an initial tangential 
contact position with said roll along a line (34) on the surface 

thereof extending generally axially with respect to said roll (23), 
said roll (23) being tiltable in a plane, whereby the lateral take-off 

position of the second band (16) is controlled by tilting said roll (23) so 
as to guide it into aligned juxtaposition with said first band (10) to 

form a layered, substantially rectangular tow band, characterized 
in that said roll (23) is tiltable in a plane defined by the axis 

thereof and the tangential initial contact position of said 
second band (16).  

 
Apparatus for producing a tow band of generally 
rectangular cross section having at least two 

layers of filaments (10, 16) in closely adjacent, 
generally parallel relation comprising  

 

a) means for advancing a first filament band (10) 
along a predetermined linear path in a 

manner such that the individual filaments 
thereof are in closely adjacent, generally 

parallel relation, 
b) means for advancing a second filament band (16) 
into substantial juxtaposed alignment with 

said first filament band, the individual 
filaments of said second filament band 

being in closely adjacent, generally 
parallel relation, said means characterized 

as comprising a godet roll (23) around which 
said filament band (16) is partially wrapped, 

said band (16) having a tangential contact 
position with said roll along a line (34) on the 

surface thereof extending generally axially 
with respect to said roll (23), the roll (23) being 

tiltable in a plane defined by the axis 
thereof and the tangential initial contact 

position of said band, whereby the 
lateral take-off position of the second 

band is controlled by tilting said roll (23) so 
as to guide it into aligned juxtaposition 

with said first band (10) to form a layered, 
substantially rectangular band.
