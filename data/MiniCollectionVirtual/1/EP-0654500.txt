<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a vinyl chloride resin composition 
for powder molding which is excellent in meltability at 

low temperatures and in powder characteristics and gives 
molded articles having excellent properties and which 

comprises a particle vinyl chloride resin, a fine particle 
vinyl chloride resin, a plasticizer, a stabilizer 

and a pigment wherein the particle vinyl chloride resin 
is obtained by the polymerization in the presence of (A) 

a fatty acid ester of sorbitan and (B) a fatty acid 
ester of polyoxyethylenesorbitan, or in the presence of 

(C) a fatty acid ester of pentaerythritol and/or a fatty 
acid ester of dipentaerythritol, or in the presence of 

(A), (B) and (C). More preferably, the particle vinyl 
chloride resin is one which is obtained by the polymerization 

in the presence of additionally (D) a fatty acid 
ester of glycerin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vinyl 
chloride resin composition for powder molding. More 
particularly, it relates to a vinyl chloride resin 
composition for powder molding which is excellent not 
only in meltability at low temperatures, but also in 
powder characteristics and furthermore, from which a 
molded article excellent in properties can be obtained 
by powder molding. The skin materials such as crash pad, armrest, 
headrest, console, meter cover and door trim which are 
interior trim parts of automobiles are required to be 
light in weight and superior in soft touch and to have 
grain leather patterns or stitch patterns which give 
feeling of high-quality. It is known that these skin materials are made 
by powder slush molding which comprises allowing a 
powder composition prepared by dryblending a vinyl 
chloride resin with a plasticizer, a stabilizer, a 
pigment or the like to contact with a heated mold, 
thereby to fuse the powders to each other and removing 
the unfused excess powders.  Recently, in the powder slush molding method, 
reduction of energy cost for preheating of mold, 
improvement of productivity by shortening the preheating 
time of mold, reduction of heat shock, and prolongation 
of life of mold by diminishing the stain of mold have 
been demanded and development of powder compositions 
which melt at low temperatures has been desired. In order to melt a powder composition at low 
temperatures, it is considered to use a vinyl chloride 
resin lowered in polymerization degree or a vinyl 
chloride resin having small particle size. However, 
according to these methods, coarse agglomerated particles 
are formed in the step of dryblending probably 
because of deterioration in absorption of plasticizer 
and thus, uniform powder compositions cannot be 
obtained. Moreover, attempts have been made to improve 
meltability of resins without using resins which are 
changed in the polymerization degree or particle size. 
For example, there are known a method of adding a 
lubricant such as a fatty acid ester of pentaerythritol 
or a fatty acid ester of dipentaerythritol to a rigid 
vinyl chloride resin (Japanese Patent Kokoku No.55-17054) 
and a method of adding a mixed ester lubricant 
obtained by the reaction of pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, 
a dibasic organic acid and a fatty acid to a 
vinyl chloride resin (Japanese Patent Kokoku No.51-20209 
and Japanese Patent Kokai No.53-6350).  However, when these lubricants are dryblended 
with vinyl chloride resins in the same manner as
