<ABSTRACT>
A nebulizer (10) having a bottom cup (28) for storing liquid 
medication (46). The bottom cup (28) has an opening (34) therethrough to 

receive a source of pressurized air. A housing (14) includes an open 
bottom (18) removably attachable to the bottom cup (28), an open top 

outlet (20), walls (30) extending therebetween, and an air inlet tube 
(22) extending through one of the walls, traversing the housing (14), 

and terminating in an aperture (24) adjacent the open bottom (18) so 
that air entering the inlet tube (22) will pass through and across the 

housing (14) before entering the housing (14) adjacent the open bottom 
(18). A cover (40) is receivable within the bottom cup (28) so that 

liquid medication (46) can be drawn from the bottom cup (28) by 
induction and form droplets, whereby the pressurized air and the liquid 

droplets will impinge on the air inlet tube (22) of the housing (14), 
thereby breaking into micron-size droplets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a breathing device for 
administering a liquid medicant to a patient. In particular, the 
present invention is directed to a breathing device that is 
simple in design, easy to manufacture, and is comprised of a 
relatively small number of components. The use of nebulizers or atomizers with intermittent 
positive pressure breathing (IPPB) equipment, ventilators, or 
with the patient's own natural breathing effort is widely 
practiced. Nebulizers or atomizers are used to deliver liquid 
medicants for a wide variety of medical conditions. There is increasing concern over treatment of contagious 
diseases, the concern being both for infection of other patients 
and for infection of medical personnel. For this reason, the use 
of disposable nebulizers which are discarded after a single 
patient's use has become popular. While many nebulizers are 
produced so that they may be washed and sterilized, and then 
reused, there is a demand for disposable nebulizers. Although existing nebulizers may be discarded after each 
use, it is costly to discard the more expensive, complicated 
nebulizers. Disposable nebulizers produced in the past have not been as 
effective as the reusable nebulizers. As an example, the 
Applicant's invention shown in USPN 4,007,238 includes a feature 
not common to disposable nebulizers. The performance of the  
 
nebulizer is directly responsive to the patient's own breathing. 
Stated another way, the output of medication matches the 
patient's changing rate of inhalation. All of the air inhaled 
by the patient is directed past the saturated mist. As the air 
flow to the patient's lungs is increased, additional liquid 
particles are delivered to the lungs because these particles are 
surrounded by a shroud of high relative humidity. Conversely, 
when the air flow to the patient's lungs is decreased, the number 
of liquid particles is decreased. The amount of saturated air 
delivered to the patient is directly responsive to the increase 
or decrease in the patient's breathing. Additionally, an extremely small average particle size is 
called for in delivery of liquid medication. For the liquid 
medication to reach the smaller passages in the bronchial tubes 
and lungs, the size of the liquid particles must be below five 
microns. These small particles are below the visible range. Furthermore, the actual particle count delivered is of great 
importance. It is desirable to incorporate these features in a nebulizer 
which is simple in design and is directed

<CLAIMS>
A nebulizer which comprises: 

(a) a bottom cup for storing liquid medication therein, 
said bottom cup having an opening therethrough to 

receive a source of pressurized air; 
(b) a substantially cylindrical housing having an open 
bottom removably attachable to said bottom cup, and an 

open top outlet; 
(c) an air inlet tube traversing said housing, said air 
inlet tube extending across the diameter of said 

housing perpendicular to said housing and terminating 
in an aperture adjacent said open bottom so that 

substantially all of the air entering said inlet tube 
upon inhalation of a patient will pass across and 

traversely to said housing before entering said 
housing adjacent said open bottom; and 
(d) a cover receivable within said bottom cup so that 
liquid medication may be drawn from said bottom cup by 

induction and form droplets, whereby said air inlet 
tube of said housing acts as a target for said 

pressurized air and said liquid droplets to impinge 
thereon, thereby breaking said droplets into micron-size 

droplets. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 1 wherein said 
housing includes a cylindrical chamber axially aligned and in 

communication with said housing having a diameter larger than 
said housing, so that air from said air inlet tube will pass into 

said cylindrical chamber. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 1 wherein said bottom 
cup is threadably received on said open bottom of said housing. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 1 wherein said air 
inlet tube has a protrusion extending radially toward said open 

bottom and wherein said liquid droplets and said pressurized air 
will impinge on said protrusion, thereby breaking said liquid 

into micron-size droplets. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 3 including a pair 
of opposed arcuate skirts extending from said air inlet tube, 

said arcuate skirts surrounding said protrusion and spaced 
inwardly from said housing. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 5 wherein said 
arcuate skirts rest against said cover. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 1 including a 
spillage prevention and atomization chamber in fluid 

communication with said inlet tube extending longitudinally along 
the exterior of said housing to retain liquid medication in the 

event said nebulizer is tilted from an upright position. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 1 wherein said bottom 
cup has a conical portion extending from a base and said 

pressurized air opening is at a concentric top of said conical 
portion and wherein said cover is received over said conical 

portion for delivery of liquid medication by induction. 
A nebulizer as set forth in claim 1 including removable 
check valve means in said housing near said open top outlet to 

provide secondary baffling and restrict passage of larger 

particles. 
A nebulizer as set forth in Claim 1 wherein said air 
 

inlet tube includes an interior raised shoulder to prevent 
secretions from passing to the bottom cup.
