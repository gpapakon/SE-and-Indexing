<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement (1) for the attachment of an object such as a measuring device (2A), sensor, probe, tube or the like in the mouth, nose or other orifice of a person or other individual. In accordance with the invention, a pressure part (6) capable of being applied externally around the body of an individual exhibits an attachment part (8) for an object (2A) of the kind in question. The pressure part (6) is so arranged as to cause said attachement through interaction with said object (2A) or with a counter-pressure device attached to the pressure part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an attachment device for holding
an elongated clinical object such as a thermometer or a tube, said
attachment device comprising a pressure part and an attachment
part, said attachment part is formed by a channel passing through
one end of the pressure part, the channel extending in relation to
an opposite end of said pressure part to form a space between
said opposite end of said pressure part and a plane extending
along said channel.US-A-4,491,426 discloses an attachment device for holding an
elongated clinical object such as a thermometer. Said attachment
device comprises a pressure part and an attachment part wherein
the attachment part is formed by a channel passing through one
end of the pressure part. The channel extends in relation to an
opposite end of said pressure part to form a space between said
opposite end of said pressure part and a plane extending along
said channel. The space between said opposite end of said
pressure part and the plane extending along said channel is intended
to receive the tongue of an individual which comes in
contact with the sensitive part of the thermometer whereas the
attachment part is fixed between the teeth. However, for fixing
this attachment device within the mouth, the individual has to be
conscious in order to clamp the attachment device with his teeth.US-A-5,097,827 discloses an attachment device for holding a
tube as an elongated clinical object comprising an elongated
pressure part. An attachment part of the attachment device for
holding the clinical object is located opposite to the elongated
pressure part. The pressure part and the attachment part are
connected by means of a contiguous neck portion. The attachment
part exhibits a cylindrical tube holder portion for receiving 
the tube. This known clip-like attachment device is to be used to
fix the tube on a patient septum. Also working quite well in this
specific kind of use it has been found, that it is quite difficult to
fix the known attachment device to other orifices of a body
defined by a rim of body tissue.The measurement and recording of the body temperature is
performed in hospitals and other health examination facilities for
ethical, hygienic, nosocomial and practical reasons with the aid of
a thermometer for oral or axillary temperature measurement. It
may be difficult, however, for certain persons who are fully
conscious to keep the thermometer in their mouth for a certain
period of between ca. 10 and 30 seconds during measurement.

<CLAIMS>
An attachment device for holding an elongated clinical
object (2) such as a thermometer (2A) or a tube (2D), said

attachment device comprising a pressure part (6) and an
attachment part (8), said attachment part (8) is formed by

a channel (9) passing through one end (6A) of the pressure
part (6), the channel (9) extending in relation to an

opposite end (6B) of said pressure part (6) to form a space
(19) between said opposite end (6B) of said pressure part

(6) and a plane (16) extending along said channel (9),
characterized in that
 the pressure part (6) exhibits friction-increasing
means (15) at a contact surface (13) to the skin

(14) of an individual.
An attachment device in accordance with claim 1,
characterized in that
 the channel (9) extends parallel with
or at a small angle (X) in relation to said opposite end (6B)

of said pressure part (6).
An attachment device in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 at least the pressure part (6) consists
of a flexible material.
