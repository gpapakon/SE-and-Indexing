<ABSTRACT>
A low power circuit which detects low level RF signals and RF 
signals of varying strength and, upon detection, activates or 

"wakes up" RF equipment, such as an automatic vehicle 
identification tag, that is normally kept in a dormant state to 

conserve operating power between active operations. The circuit 
converts a detected RF signal from a dc voltage signal to an ac 

voltage signal by "chopping" the dc signal to a "chopped dc" square 
wave, the amplitude of which is proportional to that of the 

original dc signal voltage, which in turn is proportional to the 
level of the received RF signal. The chopped dc square wave is 

then linearly combined with a threshold reference level signal of 
opposite polarity and the combined signals form the input to an accoupled 

limiting amplifier. The polarity of the amplified signal 
is identical to that of the larger of its two input signals. A 

phase detector determines the polarity of the amplified signal. 
When the phase detector discerns the detected RF activation signal, 

it activates the RF equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for detecting a low level 
RF activation signal and, upon detection, activating or "waking up" 
RF equipment, such as an automatic vehicle identification tag, that 
is normally kept in a dormant state to conserve operating power 
between active operations. An automatic vehicle identification (AVI) system uses RF 
signals to communicate information between a vehicle tag and a 
reader apparatus. AVI tags generally are powered by a compact and 
inexpensive battery and may be one of two types: "Read-Only" tags 
allow the reader apparatus to read information previously stored 
in the tag's memory, while "Read/Write" tags can also write new 
information into the tag's memory in response to signals from the 
reader. Read/Write tags are more complex than Read-Only tags and 
use more current during the active part of a transaction. The 
active state current required by the Read/Write tag usually is so 
high that it is impractical to power the tag continuously in its 
fully active state. Accordingly, it is common practice to maintain 
the tag in a low-current background state between transactions and 
activate it in response to an RF activation signal from a reader 
apparatus only when needed for a transaction.  The reader apparatus senses changes in RF reflectivity that 
result from the coded backscatter modulation signal that the tag 
emits. Some Read/Write tags emit this backscatter modulation 
signal--i.e., they continue to function in the "read" mode--while 
the tag logic remains in the low-current background state. For 
"write" functions, the Read/Write tag also must have a means for 
receiving a modulated RF "write data" signal from the reader and 
converting it by detection and amplification into a form that can 
be used by the tag's logic circuitry. Most tags, being aimed at 
low cost, use simple "direct detection" of ASK (Amplitude Shift 
Key) or "ON/OFF" RF signals to form a low voltage signal pulse 
train, whose amplitude depends on the strength of the received RF 
signal and is therefore of variable amplitude. This pulsed signal 
has to be amplified to the tag circuit's "logic level"--usually at 
whatever battery voltage is used in the tag, e.g., 3 volts for a 
lithium cell. Implementing this function is made difficult by the 
fact that the detected signal amplitude might vary from millivolts 
to volts, depending on the strength of the reader RF signal 
received at the tag. In addition, tag RF detection circuits must be able to 
distinguish stray RF signals to
