<ABSTRACT>
A method for the re-treatment of residue generated in the 
course of removing fluorine from waste water. 
The method comprises the step of: obtaining rare earth 
fluorides from the residue which is generated in the course of 

treating the waste water with a rare earth compound to remove 
fluorine ions from the waste water; and heat treating the rare 

earth fluorides at temperatures ranging from approximately 400 
to approximately 1,300 °C for times ranging from approximately 

0.5 to approximately 15 hours, after drying the rare earth 
fluorides. 
The invention pertains to the reuse of rare earth 
elements used in the treatment of fluorine. Products obtained 

by carrying out the method contain rare earth oxides, rare 
earth fluorides and rare earth oxyfluorides alone and the 

mixture thereof, which are useful as materials for general 
abrasive and as adding agents for T.V. Braun tube or for glass 

valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a treatment 
method for reusing fluorine-treated residue and, more 
particularly, to a method for re-treating with rare-earth 
compounds residue which is generated in the course of removing 
dissolved fluorine ions from waste water, so as to reuse the 
residue. In the natural world, there exists a trace amount of 
fluorine by nature, for instance, about 1.2 to 1.4 ppm. This 
trace amount of fluorine does not cause any problems in view 
of ecological environment. Now, the use of fluorine or 
fluorine-containing compounds, however, is extensively 
increased as various industries, such as electromagnetic, 
metallic, chemical or ceramic industries, have been rapidly 
developed. For example, fluorine or fluorine-containing 
compounds are used for manufacturing semiconductors, washing 
the interior of a cathode ray tube, manufacturing aluminum, 
and etc. Waste water released from a plant pertaining to the 
industries contains fluorine which is in a free radical state 
or combined state, and the concentration of fluorine in the  
 
waste water often comes to several hundreds ppm, which is very 
dangerous in view of ecology, affecting human bodies, animals 
or plants detrimentally. Accordingly, it is required to lower 
the concentration of the fluorides in the waste water. In an effort to lower the concentration of fluorine in 
the waste water, there has been proposed such a method for 
treating the fluorine-containing waste water that at least one 
species selected from a calcium compound, e.g. Ca(OH)₂, an 
aluminum compound, e.g. A1₂( S0₄)₃ and a phosphoric acid 
compound is added to the waste water, so as to insolubilize 
the fluorine ions, and the resulting supernatant and sludge is 
separated. However, the above conventional method is problematic in 
that a good deal of chemical reagents are needed, generating 
a great amount of sludge. Even though this generated sludge 
is buried, fluorides are eluted therefrom, so that a plenty of 
alkaline chemical reagents necessary to neutralize the 
fluorides are demanded. What is still worse, this 
conventional method is not so effective to the removal of the 
fluorine. In order to solve the problems, rare earth compounds have 
recently been used as fluorine-removing agents, in lieu of 
calcium oxide (Ca(OH)₂) or aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃). Rare 
earth elements along with fluorine form rare-earth fluorides, 
very stable compounds. Since these rare-earth fluorides  
 
formed are very insoluble, there is brought about an
