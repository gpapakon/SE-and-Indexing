A demining device (1), intended to ignite a 

magnetic influence mine from a distance and comprising a 
magnetic-field-generating coil (2) and its electrical 

supply circuit (5), this device being 
characterized in 
that
 the supply circuit comprises a capacitance (6) 
mounted in parallel on the terminals (3a, 3b) of the coil 

(2) and circuit breaking means (8, 15) enabling this 
capacitance (6) to be connected to and disconnected from a 

voltage source (7, 14), the circuit breaking means (8, 15) 
periodically activating a sequence comprising a connection 

for a first time interval tl intended to enable a current 
(Imax) to be established in the coil, connection followed 

by a disconnection for a second time interval t2 during 
which the circuit formed by the capacitance (6) and the 

coil (2) is a damped oscillating circuit. 
A demining device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the circuit breaking means (8) 

comprise a transistor (11) whose drain (D) is connected to 
the capacitance (6) and the source (S) is connected to the 

voltage source (7), the transistor gate (G) receiving 
power pulses supplied by an electrical control circuit 

(12). 
A demining device according to one of Claims 1 or 
2, characterized in that the capacitance is formed of two 

electrochemical capacitances (6a, 6b) mounted in series 
and connected to one another by one of their electrodes of 

the same sign, each capacitance being short-circuited by a 
diode (10a, 10b) enabling a current to pass in the 

opposite direction to that of the capacitance in question. 
A demining device according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the voltage source comprises a 

capacitor (14) and in that the circuit breaking means are 
commutator means (15) which connect the capacitor (14) to 

a power supply (16) when the capacitance (6) is 
disconnected.  

 
A demining device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the commutator means (15) comprise 

two transistors (20, 21) whose respective terminals each 
receive a different control signal supplied by a control 

generator (22), a first transistor (21) being intended to 
ensure the periodic connection and disconnection of the 

capacitance (6) from the capacitor (14), a second 
transistor (20) being intended to ensure the periodic 

connection and disconnection of the capacitor (14) to the 
power supply (16).
