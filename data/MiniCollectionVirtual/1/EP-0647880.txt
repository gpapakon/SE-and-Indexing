<ABSTRACT>
A method of processing with a developer a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material is disclosed, the 

material comprising a support and provided thereon, a silver 
halide emulsion layer comprising silver halide grains having 

not less than 90 mol % chloride, the emulsion layer or a 
hydrophilic colloid layer adjacent to the emulsion layer 

containing a tetrazolium compound or a hydrazine derivative, 
and replenisher for developer being supplied to the developer 

in an amount of not more than 200 ml per m² of the material 
processed, wherein the developer contains a carbonate salt in 

an amount of not less than 0.2 mol/liter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of processing a high
contrast silver halide photographic light-sensitive material,
and particularly to a method of processing a high contrast
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material with less
replenishing.The photomechanical film-making process comprises a
process of converting a half-tone image to a dot image. In
this process the technique according to an infectious
development has been used for reproduction of a high contrast
image. An image of high contrast and high resolution can be
obtained by processing a lith type silver halide photographic
light-sensitive material with an alkaline hydroquinone
developer having a low concentration of a sulfite ion, so-called,
a lith type infectious developer. However, such a lith type infectious developer has
problems that it is likely to subject to an air oxidation and
its extremely poor preservability makes it difficult to keep
constant a quality of continuously processed photographic
light-sensitive materials.As a method of obtaining a high contrast image rapidly
without using such a developer, there is proposed a method of
developing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material comprising a tetrazolium compound or a hydrazine
derivative, so-called, a contrast increasing agent, with an
alkaline developer. According to this method, the
preservability of the developer is excellent, rapid processing
is possible, and an ultra high contrast image can be easily
obtained.However, in the method of processing a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material comprising a contrast
increasing agent, the preservability of the developer is
improved, but the developer has problems that sensitivity
variation is increased and image sharpness is deteriorated on
processing the material with less replenishment. The
resolution of the problems has been required.Ep-A-0 554 000 provides a processing method of a silver halide photographic material
which is capable of forming arm image of improved sharpness wherein the method
is improved with respect to its environmental problem at the time of processing as well
as to its waste developer disposal problem. The developer used in the method
contains a carbanate salt and cyclodextrin. The method however does not comprise
a replenishment step and the document does not refer to or suggest any
replenishment of the developer.The demand for less replenishing of developer has been
recently increased in view of resources saving and
environmental protection. Under such a background, a
