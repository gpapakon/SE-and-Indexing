<ABSTRACT>
The combination of two composite sections (100, 200) for window or door frames comprises a composite section for forming the fixed frame part (to be fixed to the wall), and a composite section for forming the window or door frame wings. Each of these composite sections (100, 200) comprises a metal section (102, 202), a wooden section (106, 206), and a plastic section (104, 204) irremovably connecting the first two sections together. The plastic section (104, 204) both of the fixed frame part and of the wing is irremovably snap-coupled to the relative metal section (102, 202) by coupling elements (107, 108, 207, 208) which, when coupling has been effected, are inaccessible from the outside. The plastic section (104) of the fixed frame part is provided with an element (112) which elastically deforms as a result of coupling the metal section (102) and plastic section (104) together, to exert a thrust which tends to urge the two sections apart. The coupling elements (107, 108, 207, 208) and the elastically deformable element (112) are provided on parts (110, 210, 112) elastically deformable in a direction transverse to the section length, but parallel to the plane of the window or door frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
COMBINATION OF TWO COMPOSITE SECTIONS FOR WINDOW OR DOOR FRAMESThis invention relates to composite sections used for producing window or door frames, the term composite here meaning those sections consisting substantially of a metal section, a wooden section and a plastic connection section which maintains the first two sections joined together while at the same time forming a barrier against thermal bridges.As known to the expert of the art, the first frames using this type of composite section presented problems due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the various constituent materials of the composite section. Composite sections were consequently produced allowing sliding transverse to the section length, with a device for returning the constituent sections to a centered position when attempting to withdraw them in a direction perpendicular to the sections but parallel to the plane of the frame These composite sections are rather complicated, especially with regard to the metal section and plastic sectionMoreover, in known composite sections which form the fixed frame part, there is nothing which on mounting the wing opposes the forces exerted on the wooden section in the direction of the metal section deriving from the insertion of the screws which support the wing hinges, with the result that the plastic section in practice becomes permanently locked in an incorrect positionIt is consequently an object of this invention to provide a combination of composite sections for window or door frames which 

does not present the aforesaid drawback.Furthermore, window or door frames formed with known composite sections generally do not provide sufficient protection against thrusts exerted from the outside against the glass pane for house- breaking purposes, and even if protection devices against such house-breaking thrusts are sometimes provided, such devices prevent the mounting of panes or closure panels exceeding a certain thickness, the maximum allowable thickness being rather smal 1It is consequently another object of this invention to provide a combination of composite sections for window or door frames which offers high resistance against this type of house-breaking, while enabling larger panes or closure panels to be mountedThe first stated object is attained by the combination of two composite sections for window or door frames of the invention, comprising a composite section for forming the fixed frame part (to be fixed to the wall), and a composite section for forming

3. The combination claimed in claim 1, wherein the metal section (102, 202) of each composite section (100, 200) has a C- shaped recessed portion, the inside of each arm of the C comprising a tooth (107) snap-engageable with a corresponding tooth (108) provided on said corresponding elastically deformable parts (110, 210).
