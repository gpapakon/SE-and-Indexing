<ABSTRACT>
A portable liquid purifying device for dispensing a liquid, 
which includes a squeezable bottle (10, 40) made of a soft 

material and containing a mass of the liquid, a filtering 
member (16, 46, 80, 112) removably engaging a bottleneck 

(14, 44) of the bottle (10, 40), and a cover assembly (38, 
54, 100, 124) for covering a spout (24, 60, 106, 122) formed 

through the filtering member so as to fluid-tightly close 
the spout. The filtering member has a first section (20, 66, 

90, 134) which accommodates activated carbon, and a second 
section (22, 68, 94, 130) which accommodates a micro-porous 

membrane filter (32, 76, 92) including hollow fibers, the 
first and second sections being disposed in series so that 

the liquid delivered out of the bottle passes through the 
first and second sections in this order. The filtering 

member (16, 46, 80, 112) is fluid-tightly and air-tightly 
attached to the bottleneck such that the filtering member 

does not protrude past the bottleneck. The cover assembly 
(38, 54, 100, 124) has a first position for fluid-tightly 

closing the spout (24, 60, 106, 134), and a second position 
for opening the spout so as to permit the liquid to flow out 

of the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
portable liquid purifying device, and more particularly to 
the liquid purifying device which has a simple and compact 
structure, and which is suitable for emergency use and easy 
to carry around. Conventionally, various liquids used in the fields 
of medical treatment, health and hygienics, such as a 
soaking or cleaning solution for contact lenses, are stored 
or accommodated in suitable containers, and thus distributed 
to users. In many other cases, users purchase distilled 
water, and dissolve granular drugs or tablets in the 
distilled water, so as to prepare a desired solution for use 
as a pharmaceutical liquid. In the former case, using a new sterile container 
does not cause any problem. When the container storing a 
large amount of solution is used in a non-fully-sealed state 
for a long period of time, however, microorganisms may enter 
through the bottleneck of the container, whereby the 
solution is likely to be contaminated by the microorganisms. 
In the latter case, the distilled water is not sterile, and  
 
therefore microorganisms may propagate or grow in the 
solution under storage, which may result in a hygienically 
dangerous situation. In view of the above problems, there have been 
proposed various liquid purifying devices each having a 
micro-porous membrane in the form of a film or hollow fibers 
attached to a bottleneck of a bottle. Such a liquid 
purifying device is used for purifying a solution, distilled 
water or the like which has been contaminated, so as to 
obtain a sterile liquid. That is, the use of this kind of 
liquid purifying device makes it possible to easily obtain a 
sterile liquid, since the liquid passes through the 
micro-porous membrane when it flows out of the bottleneck of 
the bottle, so that microorganisms, contaminants and other 
foreign matters are removed from the liquid. However, it is difficult and costly to manufacture 
the above-described known liquid purifying device since the 
device has a complicated structure and is relatively 
large-sized. Further, the known device is not easily carried 
around and is not suitably employed as a portable water 
purifier for use upon travelling or in a state of emergency. 
Thus, the known device finds considerably limited 
applications. The known liquid purifying device has another 
problem, that is, smell may remain in the liquid even if it 
is free from microorganisms or contaminants or other foreign 
matters. Where the liquid has an offensive odor or smell, or
