<ABSTRACT>
Leakage of blood from the insertion set, during and after 
safety-needle retraction, is suppressed by components that receive 

and retain flash blood for viewing -- notwithstanding 
forces developed within the device in retraction. One preferred 

such system includes a flash chamber that moves with the 
retracting needle, within a hollow handle, carrying a relatively 

high flow-impedance element which allows air exhaust from 
the chamber into the handle to admit flash blood -- but isolates 

blood in the chamber from retraction-generated increase 
in air pressure in the handle. Energy-absorbing components 

control or compensate for retraction speed, to provide quiet 
smooth retraction -- while yet enabling use of ample retraction 

force to make retraction reliable. Among several energy absorbing 
systems disclosed is a preferred one that includes a 

viscous material introduced within the hollow handle to damp 
the retracting motion; and an injection port to facilitate 

introduction of the viscous material. Needle reuse, and concomitant 
risk of spreading disease, are avoided through components 

that deter needle redeployment -- by deterring access to 
or forward motion of the needle, or trigger reengagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to medical appliances;
and more particularly to a device for inserting into a patient's
body a medical appliance such as a cannula, e. g.
an intravascular cannula, or such as a guidewire used for
emplacing catheters etc. The invention is for helping protect
people from contracting diseases (particularly fatal diseases
such as AIDS and hepatitis) through accidental puncture by
needles that have been used in diseased patients.United States Patent 4,747,831 to Kulli sets forth the
state of the pertinent art.
Kulli teaches a safety device for
use in inserting a cannula into a patient and for thereafter
protecting people from contact with portions of the device
that have been within the patient.(For purposes of this document as in the Kulli patent,
the term "cannula" means a catheter assembly consisting of
primarily a hub and short tube -- as pictured and described in
the Kulli patent [column 3, lines 25 through 37] and herein. 
As already mentioned the technology is not necessarily limited
to use with cannulae directly but is useful as well in insertion
of other medical appliances such as catheter guidewires.)Kulli's device includes a needle for piercing a patient
and for guiding and carrying a cannula or other appliance into
place within such a patient; the needle has a shaft with at
least one sharp end. His device also includes a hollow handle
adapted to enclose at least the sharp end of the needle beyond
reach of people's fingers.In one major facet or aspect of preferred embodiments
of Kulli's invention, the invention also includes some means
(denominated the "securing means") for securing the shaft to
the handle, with the sharp end projecting from the handle. It
also includes some means (the "releasing means") for releasing
the securing means and for substantially permanently retracting
the sharp end of the needle into the handle and beyond
reach of people's fingers. The releasing and retracting means
are manually actuable by a simple unitary motion, of amplitude
that is substantially shorter than the shaft of the needle.In a second major aspect or facet, Kulli's invention also
includes (in addition to the needle and hollow handle) a block
fixed to and extending from the needle. The block is restrained
within the handle with the sharp end of the needle
projecting out of the handle through the aperture, and adapted
for motion within the handle to withdraw the needle into the
handle. The invention in this second major aspect further 
includes a trigger mechanism, which is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An introducer needle assembly (10), comprising:

a hollow needle (70) having a proximal end and a sharp distal end;
a hollow handle (20) having a distal end and a proximal end;
a needle hub (60) connected to the proximal end of the hollow needle (70) and
slidably disposed in the hollow handle (20) wherein the needle hub (60) includes a

flashback chamber (61) in fluid communication with the hollow needle for receiving
blood from within the hollow needle (70);
a spring (80) operably connected to the needle hub (60);
a latch (50) operably engaging the needle hub (60) selectively to maintain the
needle hub (60) adjacent to the distal end of the hollow handle (20) against the bias of

the spring (80); characterized in that a means is disposed in the hollow handle (20) for
slowing the speed of retraction of the needle hub (60) before the needle hub (60) is fully

retracted when the latch (50) is disengaged from the needle hub (60) and the spring (80)
biases the needle hub (60) toward the proximal end of the hollow handle (20).
The introducer needle assembly (10) of claim 1 wherein the means for slowing
the speed of the needle hub (60) is a dashpot (427) affixed to the needle hub (60).
The introducer needle assembly (10) of claim 1 wherein the means for slowing
the speed of the needle hub (60) is an outer surface on the needle hub (60) that bears

against an inner surface on the hollow handle (20) during relative motion between the
hollow handle (20) and the needle hub (60).
The introducer needle assembly (10) of claim 1 wherein the means for slowing
the speed of the needle hub (60) is a crushable filter (62') affixed to a proximal end of

the flashback chamber (61).
The introducer needle assembly of claim 1 wherein the means for slowing the
speed of the needle hub (60) is a viscous substance in the hollow handle (20).
