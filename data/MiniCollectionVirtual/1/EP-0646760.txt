<ABSTRACT>
To dampen vibration in pipes in, for example, gas 
radiators, thin plastic tubes (10,11,12) are threaded 

between the pipes (1-9). These plastic tubes are pumped 
full of a self-hardening material, for example 2-component 

epoxy, and pressurized during hardening. 
The tubes (10,11,12) in their distended state will have a 
diameter larger than the gap or space between the pipes 

(1-9), thus placing the pipes under tension when the tubes 
(10,11,12) are filled and pressurized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of providing a pipe bundle 
reinforced particularly against vibrations, wherein flexible, 
continuous spacing elements are inserted between the pipes in 
the bundle. The invention also relates to a pipe bundle having a network 
of continuous spacing elements running in the transverse 
direction of said bundle. In a shell and tube heat exchanger, for example, it is 
necessary for the pipes to be spaced apart in order to permit 
fluid flow around the pipes for heat exchange with a fluid 
flowing in said pipes. This is made possible by the use of 
spacing elements, which should preferably be thick enough in 
their dimensions to securely hold the pipes, should be 
capable of dampening vibrations caused by the fluid flowing 
in or around the pipes, should have low production costs, 
should be easy and convenient to assemble with the pipes, 
and should constitute the least possible hindrance to the 
flow of fluid between the pipes. From EP 0 105 938 it is known to use corrugated, mutually 
intersecting supporting rods between the pipes in a pipe 
bundle. From SE 379096 B it is known to use wire cables that form a 
supporting network for pipes in a pipe bundle. The wire 
cables are clasped in a frame around the pipe bundle. From US 4 204 570 it is known to use helical, elongate 
spacing elements between the pipes in a pipe bundle. Using this prior art as a point of departure, it is an 
objective of the present invention to provide a simple and 
easily implemented method for reinforcing pipe bundles with 
the aid of flexible, continuous spacing elements, and it is 
also an objective of the invention to provide a pipe bundle  
 
having continuous spacing elements running in the transverse 
direction of the bundle, and wherein the individual pipes are 
securely clamped together as a result of the interaction 
between the pipes and spacing elements. According to the invention, we therefore propose a method for 
provision of a pipe bundle reinforced particularly against 
vibrations, wherein flexible, continuous spacing elements are 
inserted between the pipes in the bundle. The method is 
characterized according to the invention in that the 
individual spacing elements consist of a tubular member, 
e.g., a plastic tube, which is threaded in between the pipes 
in the bundle, which tubular member is filled with a 
hardening material and pressurized during hardening. The flexible, continuous spacing elements in the form of 
tubular members may easily be threaded between the pipes in
