<ABSTRACT>
The brake device (26) has at least one brake surface (72), which is connected with the guide vehicle assembly group for common movement along the guide track system (10). This brake surface is intended for friction engagement with a brake track (74) running in the longitudinal direction of the guide track system. The brake surface is supported by a flexible carrier (70) and is pressable by fluid pressure build-up in a fluid pressure chamber (86) adjacent to the brake surface carrier against the brake track. The flexible brake carrier is formed with a plate-shaped or flat shell-shaped limiting wall limiting the fluid pressure chamber only to the brake track.
