<ABSTRACT>
A base cloth, on which graphic spots do not occur, for a cassette type ink ribbon used for an impact printer. The cloth consists 
of a fabric composed of multifilament threads of synthetic fiber, and is characterized in that the fineness of a warp constituting 

this fabric is 30-50D with the number of twists thereof in the range of 330-600 T/M.

<DESCRIPTION>
The predent invention relates to base fabrics for ink
ribbons used in impact printers.In recent years, the conventional spool type ink
ribbons used in impact printers are being increasingly
substituted by cassette type ink ribbons. A cassette type
ink ribbon is folded to be contained in the narrow space
of a cassette. When the cassette type ink ribbon is used
for printing by a printer, the characters printed at the
folds become disadvantageously darker than those printed
at the other portions of the ink ribbon. The more darkly
printed spots are called graphic spots. In recent years,
new types of printers quite free from the graphic spots
such as laser printers, heat transfer printers and ink jet
printers are being marketed, and in this connection, there
is an increasing demand for base fabrics for ink ribbons
not allowing the graphic spots to occur. To meet the
demand, a technique for lessening the graphic spots by
disordering the array of monofilaments by high pressure
fluid treatment to enhance the ink absorbability is 
proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 91-281277, and
techniques for lessening the graphic spots by specifying
the weave are proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.
91-34883 and 91-73378.However, the high pressure fluid treatment proposed
as a means for enhancing the ink absorbability of the base
fabric requires expensive and additional equipment
investment and increases the number of production steps,
to considerably raise the cost. The techniques for
specifying the weave of the base fabric cannot be said to
be satisfactory in the effect to lessen the graphic spots,
and since the weave is loose, the fabric is liable to be
caught by the head pins of a serial dot printer as a
problem in view of practical use.The object of the present invention is to present
base fabrics for ink ribbons not allowing the graphic
spots to occur. To achieve the object, the present
invention adopts the following means.The base fabric for ink ribbons of the present
invention are composed of synthetic multifilament
yarns, the fabric comprising warp which is from
30 to 50 D (deniers) in yarn
thickness, characterized in that the number of twists in the warp is from
330 T/M to 600 T/M and in that the base fabric is a plain weave or a modified plain weave.The present invention presents ink ribbons with an 
excellent property of not allowing the graphic spots to
occur, by specifying the number of twists of the warp used
for forming the base fabrics.In addition to not allowing the graphic spots to
occur, the
