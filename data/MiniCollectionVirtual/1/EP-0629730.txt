Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing of upholstered articles, 
in which the upholstered piece (1) is passed on a table with sliding 

surfaces through the sewing machine (6) to which said sewing machine 
is securely connected on one of its sides 
characterised in that
 pusher 
elements (3) are provided which protrude from longitudinal slots (4) from 

the table surfaces (2) and which facilitate the advance of the upholstered 
piece, in which the said elements (3) are driven out from the lower part of 

the table and travel so far until the corner of the upholstered piece (1) 
reaches the height of the sewing machine and then travel back to their 

starting position. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing of upholstered articles 
according to Claim 1 
characterised in that
 also on another side of the 
table (2) appropriate pushers (7) are provided, which protrude out of 

these surfaces through grooves (8) which exhibit the approximate shape 
of a circular arch and further run from under the table and take the 

upholstered piece (1) into its position, which is opposite the corner of the 
sewing machine, whereby it is rotated in a curved path of about 90 

degrees, in which the sewing machine head at the same time sews the 
corners of the said upholstered piece in the usual known style and 

manner and as soon as the rotation ends, the said pusher elements (7)  
 

run back to their starting position, wherein the foregoing is brought into 
operation with longitudinal action. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing of upholstered articles 
according to Claim 1 and 2 
characterised in that
 in an alternative 
embodiment the sliding surfaces are wholly or partially replaced by a set 

of rollers, which rollers extend at right angles to the side of the table, at 
which the sewing machine is located. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing of upholstered articles, 
according to Claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that
 a lower holder (5) is 
included which is driven by a pneumatic piston in the region of the 

angle of rotation in order to guarantee perfect rotation of the upholstered 
piece (1). 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing of upholstered articles 
according to Claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that
 the long pushers (3) 
preferably are activated by an element (11) which is located under the 

table surfaces and by means of guide rails, pulleys, or similar which run 
in parallel manner to the said table side in which the sewing machine (6) 

is located. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing of upholstered articles 
according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the rotary pusher (7) 
is preferably activated by means of an element (12) which also is located  

 
under the table surfaces and which moves with reference to a centre 

point of rotation whose arrangement is different and adaptable so that 
such a movement corresponds to the radius of the corner of the 

upholstered piece. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing upholstered articles 
according to Claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that
 the activation of the 
element which carries the pusher element (7) can alternatively be carried 

out by means of traction, which is applied to the end which defines the 
length. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing upholstered articles 
according to Claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that
 the activation of the 
element which carries the rotary pusher (7) in an alternative construction 

may be carried out by means of an element with teeth (9) or sockets 
which is moved by a guide rail in the form of a curved segment on curved 

shaped teeth of similar style. 
Process for the handling and perimetrical sewing upholstered articles 
according to Claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that
 the activation of the 
elements which carry the rotary pusher (7) and carried out in an 

alternative structure by means of teeth (10) in a form very similar to an 
arc segment, which travels on a guide rail of similar style, whereby the 

last mentioned are activated by a tooth-wheel drive (9).
