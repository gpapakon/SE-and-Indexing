<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a simple, cost-effective, stretchable, superabsorbent material-containing absorbent structure that provides the superabsorbent material particles therein with improved liquid holding capacity. The stretchable absorbent structure can be used in absorbent articles such as diapers, sanitary napkins, panty liners, and incontinence pads. The stretchable absorbent structure comprises a stretchable liquid impervious barrier layer (40) and an absorbent nonwoven component (43) that is bonded to the barrier layer when the barrier layer is stretched at least partially toward its stretched condition, and superabsorbent, hydrogel-forming material (41) deposited on or distributed within the nonwoven component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as
diapers, sanitary napkins, panty liners, and incontinence pads.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a simple,
cost-effective, stretchable, superabsorbent material-containing
absorbent structure for absorbent articles, such as sanitary
napkins and light incontinence products, that provides the
superabsorbent material particles therein with improved liquid
holding capacity.Absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and
incontinence pads are devices that are typically worn in the
crotch region of an undergarment. These devices are designed to
absorb and retain liquid and other discharges from the human body
and to prevent body and clothing soiling. Typically, most of the
disposable absorbent articles of the types mentioned above are
made of materials that will not stretch. That is, the materials
(and the article itself) will not stretch under the forces that
the absorbent article is normally subjected to when worn.The Kimberly-Clark Corporation received a patent, U.S. Patent
4,891,258, on a stretchable absorbent composite which issued to
Fahrenkrug on January 2, 1990. This patent is directed to a
composite structure that is comprised of at least four layers: a
liquid-pervious layer, a liquid-impervious layer, an absorbent 
layer, and a stretchable layer. The stretchable layer can
comprise an impervious elastomeric film that is apertured and
placed between the liquid-pervious layer and the absorbent layer.
The stretchable layer is stretch-bonded to the other layers and,
upon relaxing the stretched layer, a plurality of rugosities are
formed in the liquid-pervious layer, liquid-impervious layer, and
absorbent layer. The Fahrenkrug patent does not state what type
of article for which the stretchable absorbent composite described
therein might be useful. (The Applicants, therefore, do not
concede that the stretchable absorbent composite is related to the
same types of articles described herein.) The absorbent composite
disclosed in the Fahrenkrug patent also suffers from a number of
drawbacks. The Fahrenkrug patent requires the use of a separate
stretchable layer which makes the stretchable absorbent composite
stretchable, but appears to serve no purpose associated with the
absorbency or liquid retention of the composite, adding to the
cost of the same. In addition, because the stretchable layer is
comprised of liquid impervious material, and is placed between the
liquid-pervious layer and the absorbent layer, it

component (43) comprises at least some synthetic fibers.
The absorbent article (20) of any preceding Claim wherein said nonwoven
component (43) comprises at least some natural fibers.
The absorbent article (20) of any preceding Claim further comprising
superabsorbent, hydrogel-forming material (41) on said nonwoven

component (43).

hydrogel-forming material is fibrous.
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 8 wherein said fibrous
suberabsorbent material is an integral part of the nonwoven

component (43).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 7 wherein said superabsorbent,
hydrogel-forming material (41) is bonded to said nonwoven

component by moisture bonds.
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 7 wherein said superabsorbent,
hydrogel-forming material (41) is bonded to said nonwoven

component (43) by adhesive.
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 11 further comprising a
superabsorbent material containment layer (46) positioned between

said topsheet (38) and said nonwoven component (43). 
A stretchable absorbent structure (42) for an
absorbent article (20), said stretchable absorbent

structure (42) consisting essentially of:

a stretchable liquid impervious barrier layer (40),
said barrier layer (40) having a relaxed condition and

a stretched condition; and
a nonwoven component (43) as absorbent component;

characterized in that said nonwoven component is
bonded to said barrier layer (40) when said barrier

layer (40) is stretched at least partially to its
stretched condition;

wherein rugosities (66) are formed in portions of said
nonwoven component (43) when said barrier layer (40)

is relaxed.
