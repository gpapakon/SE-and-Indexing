<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of sulfated fatty acid 
alkanolamides, in which 


a) fatty acid alkanolamides are continuously reacted with 
gaseous sulfur trioxide in a reactor operating on 
the 
falling film principle, 
b) the acidic reaction products are subsequently neutralized 
with aqueous bases and 
c) are then aged for 0.1 to 1 h at a temperature of 70 
to 90°C, the pH being kept at a value of 6 to 8. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
fatty acid alkanolamides corresponding to formula (I): 


 
in which 


R¹CO is a linear or branched, aliphatic acyl radical containing 
0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds, R² is hydrogen or a 

hydroxyalkyl radical containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms and R³ 
is a hydroxyalkyl radical containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms, 

are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the sulfur trioxide is diluted with air or nitrogen 
to a concentration of 1 to 8% by volume, based on the 

mixture. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the fatty acid alkanolamides and the sulfur trioxide 
are used in a molar ratio of 1:0.95 to 1:2.0. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, 
characterized 
in that
 the sulfation is carried out at a temperature of 
80 to 98°C.  

 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, 
characterised 
in that
 the neutralization is carried out with 5 to 55% by 
weight aqueous bases from the group consisting of alkali 

metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, 
ammonia, mono-, di- and tri-C₂₋₄-alkanolamines and also 

primary, secondary and tertiary C₁₋₄ alkylamines.
