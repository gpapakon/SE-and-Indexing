<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor wafer
inspection apparatuses, and more particularly, to a
semiconductor wafer inspection apparatus for measuring
diameters of particles and counting those particles on a
surface of a semiconductor wafer.Conventionally, a semiconductor wafer inspection
apparatus has been known that is used for measuring
diameter of particles and counting those particles on a
surface of a semiconductor wafer according to a
distribution of intensity of scattered light with respect
to angles of scattering, using the Layleigh-Debye
approximation or the like. An inspection technique is
disclosed, for example, in Leon L. Pesotchinsky and Zinovy
Fichtenholz: IEEE Transactions Semiconductor
Manufacturing, Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 16-22, 1988.Fig. 17 is a schematic diagram showing a structure of
a conventional semiconductor wafer inspection apparatus.
Referring to Fig. 17, in the conventional semiconductor
wafer inspection apparatus 700, there is provided a sample
placing portion 200 having a stage 220 for scanning a 
sample (semiconductor wafer) 210 two dimensionally. Also
provided is a light projecting portion 100 for generating
a beam of light 110 with which a surface of sample 210 is
irradiated. A light collecting portion 300 is provided
between light projecting portion 100 and sample placing
portion 200 for collecting light scattered from the
surface of sample 210. Light collecting portion 300
includes a ellipsoid of revolution. A light receiving
portion 500 is provided at the focus (F2) of scattered
light collected by light collecting portion 300 for
measuring a total amount of collected light. Also
provided is a measurement control portion 600 for driving
light projecting portion 100 and sample placing portion
200 and for processing an output signal supplied from
light receiving portion 500.As for an operation of the conventional semiconductor
wafer inspection apparatus 700, firstly, measurement
control portion 600 transmits a drive signal to light
projecting portion 100 for generating a beam of light 110
from light projecting portion 100. Beam of light 110
passes through an optical beam inlet hole 310 provided at
light collecting portion 300 to become an incident light
120. A particle 230 on the surface of sample 210 is
irradiated with incident light 120. A point where
incident light 120 crosses sample 210 is the focus (F1) of 
light collecting portion 300. Beams of light scattered by
irradiation of particle 230 with incident light 120 are
collected at the other focus (F2) by light
