<ABSTRACT>
The present invention makes it possible to control the operation of the drive motor in a simple way during its return travel. According to the invention, a control circuit slaved to the conduction of a transistor T is placed in the power supply path of the motor in series with it in such a way as to reduce the return path noise in the reciprocating movement. Application to vehicle window wiping.
