<ABSTRACT>
An optical glass which is a SiO₂ - Nb₂O₅ - R'₂O 
(where R' is an alkali metal element) - F system of a 

specific composition range exhibits optical constants of 
a refractive index (Nd) of about 1.52 - 1.67 and an Abbe 

number (ν d) of about 32 - 50, is free of PbO and has an 
improved light transmissivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high dispersion optical 
glass of a SiO₂ - Nb₂O₅ - TiO₂ - R'₂0 (where R' is an alkali 
metal element) - F system having optical constants of a 
refractive index (Nd) of about 1.52 - 1.67 and an Abbe 
number (ν d) of about 32 - 50 which is excellent in light 
transmissivity and contains a relatively large content of 
Nb₂O₅ ingredient. Known in the art as optical glasses having the above 
described optical constants are glasses of a SiO₂ - PbO - 
R'₂O system, a SiO₂ - TiO₂ - R'₂O system and a SiO₂ - TiO₂ 
- R'₂O - F system disclosed in the specification of USP 
2,481,701. The first mentioned prior art optical glass, 
however, contains toxic PbO and the latter two optical 
glasses are disadvantageous in that they do not have excellent 
light transmissivity. Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol. 129, No. 1 to 3, 1991, 
pages 54 to 63 describes an optical glass consisting of KF, Nb₂O₅ 
and SiO₂. JP-A-63 265 840 (as interpreted by the Derwent Abstract, No. 88-356301) 
describes an optical glass having a refractive index of 
1.59 to 1.82, Abbe's No. of 20 to 40 and exhibiting excellent 
light transparency with the composition, comprising 5 to 55 % 
SiO₂, 1 to 50 % Nb₂O₅, 17.5 to 30 % alkali metal oxides and 0 to 
10 % fluorides (s). Further, 0.5 to 15 % B₂O₃ and 0.5 to 30 % P₂O₅ 
are present.  
 Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Sho 52-25812 
discloses a glass of a SiO₂ - TiO₂ - Nb₂O₅ - R'₂O 
system and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Sho 
52-45612 discloses a glass of a SiO₂ - Nb₂O₅ - R''₂O 
(where R'' is a divalent metal element) - R'₂O system. 
These glasses, however, do not sufficiently satisfy both 
a high dispersion optical characteristic and an excellent 
optical transmissivity which are the target of the  
 
present invention. It is, therefore, an object of the invention to 
eliminate the disadvantages of the prior art optical 
glasses comprehensively by providing a novel optical 
glass which is free from the toxic PbO ingredient, has 
optical constants of a refractive index (Nd) of about 
1.52 - 1.67 and an Abbe number (ν d) of about 32 - 50, 
and has an excellent light transmissivity. Accumulated studies and experiments made by the inventors 
of the present invention for achieving the 
above described object have resulted in a finding, which 
has led to the present invention, that an optical glass 
having the desired optical constants and an improved 
light transmissivity can be obtained in a SiO₂ - Nb₂O₅ - TiO₂ 
R'₂O - F system glass within a certain
