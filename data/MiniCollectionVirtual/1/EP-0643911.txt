<ABSTRACT>
In order that a buyer can assemble a dismantleable cage of the generic type in a simple manner without the aid of special tools, the (usually) four side walls (2 to 5) are connected to one another via profile rails (7 to 10). The profile rails are divided in two in the longitudinal direction and comprise an outer profile-rail part (16) and an inner profile-rail part (17). The two are held together in captive fashion via rotary parts (22). In the case of a variant, expansion springs (35, 36) ensure that the profile-rail parts (16, 17) are kept apart in the loose state in order to provide the widest possible plug-in gaps (33) for the wire-grid border regions (19, 20) which are to be plugged in. Rotation of the rotary parts (20), for example through approximately 90 DEG , brings the inner profile-rail part (17) closer to the outer profile-rail part (16), the wire-grid border regions (19, 20) being clamped in at the same time.
