<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The invention relates to an arrangement for recording of data of movable objects at a fixed station, n fixed stations (4, 4', 4'') succeeding one another at a distance. The objects are each provided with a device which executes a transaction and which transmits signals in each case to the fixed station (4, 4', 4''), in the zone (2) of which the corresponding object (1) is moving. The reliability of the system is to be increased. 2.2 The devices each have a memory, in which, after the transaction with a fixed station has been executed, a code for this and the time are filed. Each fixed station has a test module, in which the content of the memory is evaluated before the code of the current fixed station is filed. The conventional transaction with the current fixed station is carried out if a timespan Ti greater than a predetermined first timespan Tv1 has elapsed since the time filed in the memory, or if the code filed in the memory is the code of the fixed station preceding the current fixed station. In addition to the conventional transaction with the current fixed station, further transactions provided at fixed stations preceding the current fixed station are carried out or a transaction comprising the transactions at the preceding and current fixed stations is carried out if the filed code is that of a farther preceding fixed station and the timespan Ti is smaller than a predetermined time Tv2. 2.3 The invention can be used in systems for the automatic recording of charges in road traffic.
