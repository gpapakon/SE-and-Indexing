<ABSTRACT>
Directional multi-blade boring heads (1000, 1050) are 
disclosed which have first and second blades (1030, 1032) 

which each define a deflecting surface (1036, 1038) for 
deflecting the boring head when the head is advanced 

without rotation. At least one intermediate blade (1034) 
extends between the deflecting surfaces in a three blade 

design. In a four blade design, a second intermediate 
blade (1042) extends on the side opposite the first 

intermediate blade (1034). The boring head is 
particularly effective in drilling a straight borehole 

through a variety of soil conditions when the boring head 
is simultaneously rotated and advanced along the direction 

of boring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 857,167, filed on March 25, 1992. This invention relates to a steerable fluid assisted 
mechanical boring head for drilling substantially 
horizontal boreholes under a roadway or other obstruction.  Using boring machines with a steerable bit or head 
for drilling horizontal boreholes under a roadway or other 
obstruction is a well known practice. The process of 
providing such boreholes is generally referred to as 
"trenchless" digging, since an open trench is not 
required. A key to the operation of such a boring device 
is to have an effective steerable boring bit or head. If 
the bit is steerable, the operator can redirect the 
borehole along the proper path if it begins diverting from 
the desired path, and also allows the operator to steer 
around obstructions underground. Many drill bits have been designed which have such a 
steering feature. However, there is a continuing need to 
develop boring bits which have better directional control, 
operate in a variety of soil conditions effectively and 
provide enhanced cutting action.  In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, a directional multi-blade boring head is 
provided for use on a boring machine. The boring machine 
is capable of axially advancing and rotating a drill 
string about an axis of rotation underground. The drill 
string ends in the directional multi-blade boring head. The directional multi-blade boring head includes a 
body having a central axis of rotation and a blade 
assembly mounted on the body. The blade assembly includes 
a first blade defining a deflecting surface which extends 
at an oblique angle to the central axis of rotation of the 
body. The blade assembly further includes a second blade 
defining a deflecting surface at an oblique angle to the 
central axis of rotation of the body. The first and 
second blades extend at an angle relative each other. At 
least one intermediate blade extends from the blade 
assembly between the deflecting surfaces on the first and 
second blades. The deflecting surfaces of the first and 
second blades deflect the boring head as the boring 
machine advances the drill string without rotation. When 
the boring machine simultaneously axially advances and 
rotates the drill string, the directional multi-blade 
boring head drills a relatively straight borehole. In accordance with another aspect of the present 
invention, the directional multi-blade boring head has 
first one intermediate blade so that the
