<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder compositions for inhalation and to 
containers suitable for use in dry powder inhalers which contain said 
powder compositions. A common procedure for administering such medicaments is to 
inhale a unit dose of the drug or a composition containing a unit dose of 
the drug by means of a specially designed inhaler. The powdered drug 
or composition is normally located within a container, for example a 
hard gelatin capsule or a blister package, or a multi-dose device so that it 
can be safely stored until required. The capsule or blister is ruptured or 
broached within the inhaler, thereby enabling the powder to be inhaled. Generally the mean particle size of the drug used for inhalation is 
between 1 and 10 microns, with the size range between 2 and 5 microns 
being particularly suitable for treating respiratory conditions where the 
drug has to penetrate to the peripheral airways of the lungs. Such 
particle size ranges are commonly achieved by means of micronisation 
or spray drying. In the present specification, powders with a mean 
particle size within these ranges are described as "microfine", 
irrespective of the method by which the size of the powder is effected. The finely divided drug powder is often administered as a 
composition comprising a blend or mixture of the medicament with an 
inert carrier. Usually the inert carrier has a mean particle size 
substantially larger than that of the drug. The use of a composition, as 
opposed to the drug alone, is advantageous because frequently the dose 
to be administered is very small, for example 200 micrograms or 400 
micrograms. Such small quantities could not be accurately dispensed 
into the containers. By blending the drug uniformly with a large excess 
of the inert carrier, the amount dispensed into the containers is  
 
substantially increased, thus facilitating the mechanical dispensing 
operation. Furthermore, the finely divided drug powders frequently exhibit 
very poor flow properties, which compromise the accuracy with which 
they can be dispensed rapidly into containers. By blending microfine 
drug and an excess of inert carrier which has a substantially larger 
median particle size, the flow properties of the composition may be 
enhanced and the dispensing accuracy improved. Commonly described carrier materials include calcium carbonate 
and sugars, for example sucrose, mannitol or dextrose or, more 
particularly, lactose, which are pharmaceutically acceptable and pose no 
problems of toxicity, since any
