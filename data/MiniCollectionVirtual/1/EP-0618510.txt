<ABSTRACT>
A method for making conductive toner particles includes (A) heat treating in 
fluidized bed processing equipment a mixture of non-conductive toner particles containing a 

thermoplastic resin and a colorant, and an effective amount of conductive powder blended 
with and coated on surfaces of the non-conductive toner particles, wherein the heat treatment 

is carried out at a temperature at or above the glass transition temperature of the resin for a 
period of time at least sufficient to fuse the conductive powder onto the surfaces of the non-conductive 

toner particles, and then (B) cooling the heated conductive toner particles to a 
temperature below the glass transition temperature of the resin. The final toner particles have 

a conductivity of at least about 10⁻⁸ ohm⁻¹-cm⁻¹ and preferably from about 10⁻⁴ to about 10⁻⁸ 
ohm⁻¹-cm⁻¹.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conductive single-component developers. More particularly,
this invention relates to methods for making conductive dry toners which are suitable for
developing an electrostatic latent image formed by electrophotography, electrostatic
recording, ionography and the like.Recording systems for visualizing image information through an electrostatic latent
image, such as electrophotography, are now widespread in various fields. In
electrophotography, an electrophotographic photoreceptor is charged and then exposed to
light to form an electrostatic latent image, the latent image is developed with a developer
containing a toner, and the toner image is transferred and fixed. Developers used in
electrophotography include two-component developers containing a toner and a carrier, and
single-component developers containing a toner and no carrier.Conductive toners for single-component developers used in electrophotography and
methods for making them are disclosed, for example, in US-A-3,639,245 and US-A-3,196,032.According to the method taught in US-A-3,639,245, a dry-powder blend is first
obtained by any of several standard means, for example, by melting a resin, stirring in the solid
filler, if any, allowing the mixture to cool, then grinding and classifying to the appropriate
particle size range of approximately 1 to 15 µm diameter. This powder, which is pseudocubical
in shape, is then "spheroidized" by aspirating the powder into a moving gas stream, preferably
air, thus creating an aerosol, and directing the aerosol at about 90° (plus or minus 5°) through
a stream of hot air, which has been heated to about 900-1100°F (482-593°C), into a cooling
chamber, where the powder is then allowed to settle by gravity while it cools. The resulting
powder is made up of substantially spherical particles. It is then dry blended with conductive
powder, such as conductive carbon black, and the mixture is directed at about 90° (plus or
minus 5°) through a stream of gas, preferably air, heated to a temperature (e.g., 700-800°F;
391-427°C) which can at least soften and desirably melt the thermoplastic resin in the particles
and maintain that softened or molten condition for a period of time sufficient to permit the
conductive powder to become essentially completely embedded onto the resin particle surface,
due to the effects of surface tension.A drawback to the Nelson method is that the high temperature (371-427°C) used
therein allows for only a brief heat treatment period, i.e., several seconds, for the
to
