Procedure for the fully automatic cleaning of cylinders 
in printing machines equipped a with central control 

system, using a separate automated washing unit 
for each cylinder,
wherein
 
the central control system is extended in such a way 

as to enable 

a) the operating parameters - necessary for the determination 
of the optimal wash-cycle program of each 

separate washing unit - to be collected by acceding 
to the central control system of the printing machine, 
b) said optimal wash-cycle program for each separate 
washing unit to be automatically determined, 
c) the operation of each separate washing unit to be 
controlled by its own optimal wash-cycle program. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
a wash-cycle central computer is used as an extension 

to the central control system of the printing machine. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the determination of the optimal wash-cycle program of 

each separate washing unit is brought about by selecting 
the closest approximation out of a number of 

preset sets of wash-cycle programs.  
 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the optimal wash-cycle program of each separate washing 

unit is generated, as a function of the operating 
parameters collected, by means of an algorhythm. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the rotational speed of the cylinder to be cleaned during 

said wash cycle is taken into account as an operating 
parameter when determining the optimal wash-cycle 

program of each separate washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the time of said wash cycle, and possibly the time interval 

elapsed since the time of the last wash cycle, 
are taken into account as operating parameters when 

determining the optimal wash-cycle program of each separate 
washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the presence of stock of cloth coming into contact 

with the cylinder during said wash cycle is to be taken 
into account as an operating parameter when determining 

the optimal wash-cycle program of each separate 
washing unit.  

 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the presence of paper coming into contact with the cylinder 

during said wash cycle - and particularly which 
side of the paper, the face or reverse side - is to be 

taken into account as an operating parameter when determining 
the optimal wash-cycle program of each separate 

washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the type of paper is to be taken into account as an 

operating parameter when determining the optimal wash-cycle 
program of each separate washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the type of colour is to be taken into account as an 

operating parameter when determining the optimal wash-cycle 
program of each separate washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the cylinder position with regard to the printing sequence 

is to be taken into account as an operating parameter 
when determining the optimal wash-cycle program 

of each separate washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the sense of cylinder rotation is to be taken into account 

as an operating parameter when determining the 
optimal wash-cycle program of each separate washing 

unit.  
 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the quantity of dampening water used during the printing 

process is to be taken into account as an operating 
parameter when determining the optimal wash-cycle 

program of each separate washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein,
 
in the case of roller printing machines, the looping 

angle of the run of cloth around the cylinder is to be 
taken into account as an operating parameter when determining 

the optimal wash-cycle program of each separate 
washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 14,
wherein
 
the cloth guide path data are used to determine the 

looping angle of the run of cloth. 
Procedure according to claim 14,
wherein
 
three different stock looping angle zones: 


a) 0 degrees 
b) up to about 5 degrees and 
c) more than about 5 degrees 
 
are detected. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the fact whether or not, in the case of a rubber blanket 

cylinder, said cylinder - as part of the printing 
process - is a colour-carrying cylinder, is to be taken 

into account as an operating parameter when determining 
the optimal wash-cycle program of each separate 

washing unit.  
 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the fact whether the cylinder to be cleaned has come 

into contact with either printed or unprinted stock of 
cloth is to be taken into account as an operating parameter 

when determining the optimal wash-cycle program 
of each separate washing unit. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the ideal start time for each wash cycle is determined, 

with each wash cycle being automatically released 
eiterh precisely at said ideal start time previously 

determined or as soon as possible thereafter. 
Procedure according to claim 1,
wherein
 
the wash-cycle programs previously determined can be 

checked and corrected by hand from the central control 
system of the printing machine. 
Procedure according to either of the preceding claims,
wherein,
 
in the case of roller printing machines with guide 

rollers with at least one superimposed rubber-blanket 
cylinder, at least part of said guide rollers require 

cleaning by 

a) acceding to the central control system of the printing 
machine with a view to selecting either the 

last automated upstream washing unit directly ahead 
of the guide rollers in the feeding direction of 

the cloth run, or the last automated upstream washing 
unit directly ahead of each of the two cylinders, 

in the feeding direction of the cloth run, 
one of which presses against the face of the cloth 

and the other against the reverse of the cloth, 
b) determining at least one wash program for each of 
said automated washing units by which exactly that 

quantity of cleaning liquor is sprinkled onto the  
 

run of cloth that corresponds to the moisture requirement 
of the guide rollers as determined in a 

continuous manner by the central control system of 
the printing machine, 
c) regulating and controlling said selected automated 
washing unit(s) by means of said wash program(s) 

thus determined, 
d) enabling the guide rollers - with a view to producing 
slippage between the guide roller and the 

run of cloth - to be controlled, stopped or driven 
by hand or from the central control panel while in 

contact with the dampened run of cloth.
