<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an 
alkoxysilane which is one of important intermediates in the field of 
silicone industry. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
process for preparing an alkoxysilane In a high yield by a halogen-free 
process. Japanese Patent Kokai No.132590/1989 discloses a process 
for preparing an alkoxysilane, comprising the step of: 
reacting an alkoxysilane of the general formula:

R¹aSi(OR²)4-a


 
wherein R¹ represents a monovalent substituted or unsubstituted 
hydrocarbon group, R² represents an alkyl group, and a is 0, 1, 2 or 3, 
with a polysiloxane in the presence of a titanium compound catalyst to 
form an alkoxysilane of the general formula:

R³bSiHc(OR²)4-(b+c)


 
wherein R² is the same as defined above, R³ represents a monovalent 
substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group, b is 1, 2 or 3, and c is 
0, 1, or 2. According to the above process, for example, 
tetramethoxysilane is reacted with polymethylhydrogensiloxane 
represented by the formula:

Me₃SiO-(MeHSiO)₄₀-SiOMe₃

 
 
to obtain dimethoxymethylsilane. Tetraethoxysilane is reacted with 
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane represented by the formula:

(Me₂SiO)₄


 
to obtain diethoxydimethylsilane. In this process, the Si-O bonds in 
the polysiloxane molecule are said to be cleaved by the titanium 
compound used as a catalyst, followed by the insertion reaction of the 
alkoxy group from the alkoxysilane of the raw material into the 
cleaved portion to form the intended alkoxysilane. The process has an advantage that halogen compounds such as 
hydrogen chloride and chlorosilane are not by-produced since the 
reaction is a halogen-free reaction. However, it has problems that 
many byproducts other than the halogen compounds are formed in a 
large amount to lower the yield of the intended compound, requiring 
tedious purification procedure. It is an object of the present invention to solve such 
problems and provide a process for preparing an alkoxysilane in a high 
purity and a high yield. It has been found that, when an alkoxysilane is reacted with a 
polysiloxane in the presence of a catalyst comprising an aluminum 
alkoxide, a zirconium alkoxide or a zirconium chelate, byproducts are 
formed in a small amount in comparison with conventional methods to 
obtain the intended alkoxysilane in a high yield, thus making it easy to 
separate the byproducts from the desired alkoxysilane.  Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for 
preparing an alkoxysilane of the
