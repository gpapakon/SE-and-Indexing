<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a carboxylic acid derivative represented by general formula [VIII], (wherein R¹, 

R², R³ and L are each as defined in the specification), which comprises reacting a benzyl halide with a cyano 
compound to give a phenylacetonitrile, reacting the nitrile with an alkyl nitrite in the presence of a base to 

give an α-hydroxyiminophenylacetonitrile, reacting the hydroxy nitrile with an alkylating agent to give an α-alkoxyiminophenylacetonitrile, 
hydrolyzing the alkoxy nitrile in the presence of a base, optionally after hydration 

and acid treatment, to give an α-alkoxyiminophenylacetic acid, and finally reacting the acid with a halogenating 
agent, or converting the acid into a corresponding metal salt and reacting the salt with an alkylating agent, or reacting 

the acid with a lower alcohol in the presence of an acidic catalyst. According to this process, the reactions can be 
advanced through the respective steps under mild conditions, and the target derivative [VIII]
 can be produced even 
without resort to high-pressure steam equipment, high-temperature heat medium equipment, refrigerator, and so forth. 

Further, this process is advantageous in that only a single solvent will suffice without the necessity for using various 
solvents according to the respective steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing carboxylic acid derivatives
of the general formula [VIII]:

wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, C1-C5
alkyl, C1-C5 alkoxy, C2-C4 alkenyl, halogen or trifluoromethyl, R3 is C1-C5
alkyl, and L
is halogen or C1-C5 alkoxy.The carboxylic acid derivatives [VIII] are useful as agricultural fungicides or
their intermediates (JP-A 4-295454), and as the process for their production, it has been
known that they can be produced by the following route in which metal salts of phenol
derivatives of the general formula [ I ]:

wherein R1 and R2 are each as defined above and A is an alkali metal or an alkaline earth
metal, are used as the staring material (JP-A 4-295454): 
However, when the carboxylic acid derivatives [VIII] are produced by such a
process, the reaction in the step (i) is effected at a high temperature such as 200°C, which
requires factory facilities for use as a heating source, such as high-pressure
steam equipment
or high-temperature heat medium control equipment, or the reaction in the step (iv)
is effected under cooling below 0°C, which requires various facilities such as freezing
machines. This process is, therefore, not a satisfactory process from an industrial point
of view.Further, in this process, different solvents are used in the respective steps:
for example, methanol in the step (i); toluene in the steps (ii) and (iii); methyl t-butyl
ether and methanol (reaction solvent) as well as dichloromethane (extraction solvent) in
the step (iv); and methanol and dichloromethane (reaction solvent) in the step (v). In
addition to such a complicated feature that various kinds of solvents are used in the
production on an industrial scale, there is another disadvantage that it requires solvent 
recovery facilities and numerous solvent storage tanks, in which respect the above
process is not satisfactory as an industrial production process.The present inventors have extensively studied to develop an industrially
favorable route for production of carboxylic acid derivatives [VIII]. As a result, they
have found a quite novel route for production of carboxylic acid derivatives [VIII] where
the respective reactions can be allowed to proceed under mild reaction conditions, for
example, at temperatures of from room temperature to about 150°C. As a result of further
studies, they have found that this route makes it possible to use only one solvent without
using various different solvents in the respective steps,
