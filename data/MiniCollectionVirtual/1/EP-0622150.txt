<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the assembling of workpieces (1, 2), which are stamped (deep-drawn) or simply folded, and which, after positioning them, in order to be joined in pairs by laser welding, each have a peripheral flange (3, 4), the welding taking place on the said flanges, characterised in that, before the welding operation, the said flanges are turned over through the same angle, but in opposite directions for the two workpieces (1, 2), so as to produce a step (13, 14) ensuring conical fitting of the two half-shells (1, 2) and in that the laser welding beam (9) is directed onto the said step in order to carry out the welding. The invention makes it possible, in particular, to reduce the width of the turned-down edges of the assembly flanges and applies to any assembly of metal sheets which are stamped particularly in the form of half-shells (1, 2) for the production of containers, such as tanks for motor vehicles.

Method of welding stamped, or folded, workpieces 
using a laser beam, the said workpieces being formed into 

two half-shells (1, 2) which, after they are positioned 
for the purpose of joining them in pairs by welding, have 

peripheral assembly flanges (3, 4), the welding taking 
place on the said flanges, while the half-shells extend 

on either side of these flanges, characterized in that, 
before the welding operation, the flanges (3, 4) are 

turned down at the same angle, but in opposite 
directions, on the two workpieces (1, 2) to be joined 

together, so as to produce steps (13, 14) ensuring 
conical interlocking of the said workpieces and in that 

the laser welding beam (9) is directed onto the said 
steps (13, 14) with an orientation which is inclined with 

respect to the half-shells to be joined together. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that one (13) of 
the said steps undergoes a treatment so 
as to give it transverse grooves (11). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the depth of the said grooves (11) is between 0.1 

and 0.2 mm. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flanges (3, 4) are turned down at the same time 

as the stamping operation serving to obtain the 
workpieces (1, 2) to be assembled is carried out. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the turning-down operation is carried out by means 

of a blank holder (33) before the stamping operation. 
Assembly obtained by joining together at least 
two half-shell workpieces provided with peripheral  

 
welding flanges, characterized in that the said flanges 

(3, 4) are turned down at the same angle, but in opposite 
directions, on the two half-shells (1, 2) to be joined 

together, so as to form inclined steps (13, 14) ensuring 
conical interlocking the said workpieces. 
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that it constitutes a container. 
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that at least one step (13) is provided with the shallow 

transverse grooves (11).
