<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the separation of gases at low
temperatures. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of carbon
molecular sieve membranes for the separation of gases at temperatures
approaching those at which gases liquefy.Carbon molecular sieve membranes are an example of microporous
membranes (pore size less than 20 Angstroms), which separate gas
molecules on the basis of their different diameters (molecular sieving).
The mechanism for such membrane transport is based on a combination of
adsorption within and activated diffusion along the pore length. Studies
of gas permeation through microporous membranes show selectivities
much greater than would be expected from Knudsen diffusion - the
predominant bulk process in micropores. Therefore, the process can be
seen to occur predominantly through hopping between adsorption sites.
The permeation rate will be proportional to the product of the local
gradient of the concentration of gas molecules adsorbed on the pore and
the effective diffusion coefficient (D) at that point in the pore.The temperature dependence of the permeability in membranes will
depend on the temperature dependence of the activated diffusion
coefficient D, and that of the extent of adsorption. While adsorption
isotherms show that the extent of adsorption for most gases on most
materials will increase with a drop in temperature, the activated diffusion 
coefficient often drops much more drastically, leading to a net drop in
permeability with the drop in temperature. This is particularly the case
for glassy polymers where the process for activated transport involves
some movement of polymer segments to allow movement of gas molecules
through interconnected free volumes. Even though some polymer
membranes are known to show an increase in selectivity with decrease in
temperatures, they suffer a disastrous loss of permeability even for the
faster member of a gas pair as the membrane approaches the temperature
where all polymer motion is frozen out. Such polymer membranes are
therefore of limited applications at low temperatures. This is illustrated
by Fig. 1 which shows that for polytrimethylsilyl propyne (PTMSP), one of
the more state of the art membranes, the permeability drops drastically
below -20°C.The art has provided a number of solutions for the separation of difficultly
separable gases, which are expensive and complicated to build and to
operate. One representative example of such a process is the separation of
close boiling gases, such as oxygen from
