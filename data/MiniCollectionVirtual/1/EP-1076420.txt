<ABSTRACT>
An attenuation control signal for controlling the power of a
transmitted signal is generated as follows: A root-mean-square

processor 22, receiving a detected output signal of the transmitted
signal from a detector 21, carries out the root-mean-square processing

of the detected output signal, and a comparator 8 compares the detected
output signal passing through the root-mean-square processing with

a reference signal, thereby generating the attenuation control
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission power controller and a transmission power control method capable of carrying out stable transmission power control independently of the number of the channels to be multiplexed by a modulator in the transmission power control in a CDMA communications system.Fig. 5 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional transmission power controller. In Fig. 5, the reference numeral 1 designates a modulator for carrying out spreading and modulation and multiplexing of a plurality of user communication signals CH1-CHn fed from a baseband stage (not shown) in order to spread the spectrum of each narrow band user communication signal to a wide band signal. The communications system is referred to as a CDMA (code division multiple access) system. The reference numeral 2 designates a mixer for mixing a transmitted signal output from the modulator 1 with a signal output from a local oscillator 3; 4 designates a variable attenuator for carrying out attenuation control of the transmitted signal passing through the mixing by the mixer 2 in response to an attenuation control signal slot by slot, for example; 5 designates a power amplifier for amplifying the transmitted signal passing through the attenuation control by the variable attenuator 4 to be output.The reference numeral 6 designates a detector for capturing the amplified transmitted signal via a coupler 6a at every predetermined time interval, and for detecting it. The reference numeral 7 designates an A/D converter for A/D converting the transmitted signal captured by the detector 6; 8 designates a comparator for comparing the output signal of the A/D converter 7 with a reference signal captured by a reference voltage generator 9, and for outputting the compared result; 9 designates the reference voltage generator for generating the reference voltage from the total transmission power of the user communication signals multiplexed by the modulator 1; and 10 designates a compared result output section for supplying the variable attenuator 4 with the compared result output from the comparator 8.Next, the operation will be described.First, the modulator 1 carries out the spreading and modulation of the plurality of user communication signals CH1-CHn fed from the baseband stage, and multiplexes the spread modulated signals. Then, the mixer 2 mixes the transmitted signal supplied from the modulator 1 with the signal supplied from the local oscillator 3, and outputs the mixed signal. Subsequently, the variable
