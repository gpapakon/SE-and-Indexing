<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic honeycomb catalyst includes a thin-walled 
honeycomb structural body (10) and a catalytic 

substance carried by the honeycomb structural body (10). 
The honeycomb structural body (10) has a number of 

longitudinally extending flow passages (13) defined by 
an outer peripheral wall (11) and partition walls (12) 

with a reduced thickness (t). The honeycomb structural 
body (10) satisfies particular relationships between the 

partition wall thickness (t) and the open frontal area 
(OFA) or bulk density (G). Notwithstanding the thin-walled 

partition walls, the honeycomb structural body 
(10) has practically satisfactory compressive strength 

characteristics. The catalyst comprising the honeycomb 
structural body (10) has reduced pressure loss and heat 

capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic 
honeycomb structural body suitable for a catalyst 
carrier, wherein a number of flow channels having a 
polygonal cell-like cross-section and extending 
longitudinally through the honeycomb structural body are 
defined by a peripheral wall and partition walls 
arranged inside of the peripheral wall. The present invention also relates to a ceramic 
honeycomb catalyst comprising such a honeycomb 
structural body and a catalytic substance carried 
thereon. The ceramic honeycomb structural body having the 
above-mentioned arrangement is widely used, for example, 
as a catalyst carrier in an exhaust gas cleaning system 
for automobiles. The ceramic honeycomb structural body 
as the catalyst carrier has become widespread due to a 
low pressure loss during passage of the exhaust gas as a 
result of a high open frontal area, and an excellent  
 
exhaust gas clarifying performance. In this connection, 
an advanced ceramic honeycomb structural body which has 
been put into practical use has, for example, a 
partition wall thickness of 0.170 mm and a cell density 
of 60 cells per 1 cm2. In accordance with a recent enhancement in the 
exhaust gas regulation as related to environmental 
problems, e.g., a requirement for reduction in the total 
emission amount of hydrocarbon in the LA-4 mode which is 
one of exhaust gas evaluation test modes in the United 
States, there is a strong demand for an improved ceramic 
honeycomb structural body which is capable of achieving 
a distinguished exhaust gas clarifying performance as 
compared to conventional honeycomb structural bodies. 
Specifically, in an operational state immediately after 
starting an engine, i.e., in the so-called cold start 
state, the exhaust gas clarifying efficiency undergoes a 
considerable deterioration because the catalyst is still 
not much warmed and hence it is not sufficiently 
activated. Thus, an early activation of the catalyst 
during the cold start state is considered as the most 
important task to clear the exhaust gas regulation. 
From such a viewpoint, as a general discussion, it has 
been proposed to reduce the thickness of the partition 
walls of the ceramic honeycomb structural body. The 
thin-walled ceramic honeycomb structural body serves on  
 
one hand to increase the open frontal area and thereby 
decrease the pressure loss and reduce the structure 
weight, and on the other hand to decrease the heat 
capacity of the catalyst and enhance the temperature 
elevation speed of the catalyst.
