<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a pneumatic tire having at 
least one of a group of two or more kinds of island-like 

blocks (26) having mutually different circumferential dimensions 
and a group of two or
 more kinds of blocks (24) which are each 
defined by adjacent lug grooves (20) of a plurality of lug 

grooves arranged in a circumferential row and have mutually 
different circumferential dimensions, wherein a slit (30) 

for lowering rigidity is formed in at least one of each of 
the island-like blocks (26A) whose circumferential dimensions are 

relatively large among the island-like blocks and each of 
the blocks whose circumferential dimensions are relatively 

large among the blocks defined by the adjacent lug grooves. 
Hence, the rigidity of large blocks is lowered, and the 

difference in rigidity between the large blocks and the 
small blocks is reduced so as to improve the uniformity of 

the tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a pneumatic tire and a pneumatic tire 
manufactured by that method, and more particularly to a 
method of manufacturing a pneumatic tire which is provided 
with two or more kinds of island-like blocks having mutually 
different circumferential dimensions and/or two or more 
kinds of blocks which are each defined by adjacent lug 
grooves of a plurality of lug grooves arranged in a 
circumferential row and have mutually different 
circumferential dimensions, so as to improve the uniformity 
of the tire. In general, in the design of a tread pattern of a tire, 
the pitches of the blocks are made irregular so as to 
minimize the pattern noise which is the most dominant among 
the kinds of tire noise. According to current design 
methods, the present situation is such that large and small 
blocks of various patterns produced by these irregular 
pitches inevitably result in nonuniformity in the 
circumferential direction of the top tread gage.  
 
At this time, as shown in Fig. 12, the gage difference 
Δt (a gage T2 of a large block portion - a gage T1 of a 
small block portion) between a large block 110 and a small 
block 112 is expressed by the following Formula (1) if a 
negative ratio (a ratio between a groove area and a tread 
area) is fixed:

Δt = (1/L1 - l/L2) × H² × tanα   Formula (1) 


 
where T1 denotes the tread gage of the small block portion 
after vulcanization molding; T2 denotes the tread gage of 
the large block portion after vulcanization molding; L1 
denotes a circumferential dimension of the small block 112 
(in Fig. 12, L1 indicates the circumferential pitch of the 
small block 112, but has the same dimension as the 
circumferential dimension of the small block 112); L2 
denotes a circumferential dimension of the large block 110 
(in Fig. 12, L2 indicates the circumferential pitch of the 
large block 110, but has the same dimension as the 
circumferential dimension of the large block 110); W1 
denotes the groove width at the opening of a groove 116 in 
the small block 112; W2 denotes the groove width at the 
opening of a groove 118 in the large block 110; H denotes 
the depth of the groove 116 or the groove 118; α denotes an 
angle of inclination of the side wall of the groove 116 or  
 
the groove 118 with respect to the direction of the groove 
depth. Formula (1) above is derived in the following 
procedure. As shown in Fig. 12, if the tread gage in a green tire 
before vulcanisation molding is assumed to be T0, the
