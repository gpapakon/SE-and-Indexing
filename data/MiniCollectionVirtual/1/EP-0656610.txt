<ABSTRACT>
This device detects the overstepping of a predetermined temperature threshold, especially a low temperature threshold, and bars the subsequent use of this apparatus. It includes a temperature detecting element (12), capable of passing in a non-reversible manner from a first to a second stable state and delivering a warning signal when it is in this second state; and means of control, cooperating with the detector in order to deliver, in response to the warning signal, a signal for disabling the electronic apparatus. According to the invention, this temperature detecting element is an electrical element including a DC voltage source (15), an electrical or electronic component (17) able to take two states corresponding to the said first and second stable states and a thermostatic switch (16) which closes, for temperature values beyond the threshold, a circuit comprising the source and the component such that the flow of a current through the thermostatic switch prompts a transition from the first to the second state.

Apparatus for detecting the fact that a predetermined temperature
threshold has been crossed by the circuits of a secure electronic

appliance, in particular those of a postage meter or "franking
machine", and for preventing any subsequent use of the appliance

after such crossing has occurred, the apparatus including the
following disposed inside a protected enclosure:


a temperature detector member (12) capable of changing non-reversibly
from a first stable state to a second stable state when

said predetermined threshold is crossed, and of delivering an alarm
signal when it finds itself in the second state; and
control means co-operating with the detector to respond to the
alarm signal by delivering a disable signal suitable for preventing

any use of the electronic appliance;
said apparatus being characterized in that the temperature
detector member is an electrical member including:
a voltage source (15) delivering a DC voltage;
an electrical or electronic component (17; 21) capable of
taking two states corresponding to said first and second stable

states; and
a thermostatic switch (16; 36) which, at temperatures situated
beyond said predetermined threshold, closes a circuit including the

voltage source and the electrical or electronic component so that a
current passing through the thermostatic switch causes the electrical

or electronic component to go from the first state to the second
state.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the
temperature detector is a low-temperature detector, the thermostatic

switch closing the circuit at temperatures lower than said threshold.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the
electrical or electronic component is a fuse (17) connected in a

current mesh also including the voltage source and the thermostatic
switch. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that the alarm
signal is given by the voltage taken at a point (A) that is common to

the fuse (17) and to the thermostatic switch (16; 35).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the
electrical or electronic component is an RS bistable (21) having its

triggering input (24) connected to the thermostatic switch (16; 35).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the disable
signal delivered by the control means is applied to an input of a

microcontroller (2) for controlling the electronic appliance, and in
that, in the presence of the disable signal, the microcontroller

switches to a mode preventing any use of the electronic appliance.
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that, when the
disable signal is delivered it has a variable level representing the

voltage delivered by the voltage source of the temperature detector
member, in that the signal is applied to an analog input of the

microcontroller (2), and in that, in the event that the voltage is
less than a given limit value, the microcontroller delivers a warning

message indicating that the battery should be changed and/or switches
to a mode preventing any use of the electronic appliance.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the disable
signal delivered by the control means is applied to an input of a

supervisor circuit (7) for supervising the power supply circuit (4,
5, 6, 8) of the electronic appliance, and in that, in the presence of

the disable signal, the supervisor circuit takes the power supply of
the electronic appliance out of service.
Apparatus according to claim 1, for detecting both when the
appliance crosses a low temperature threshold, and also when the

appliance crosses a high temperature threshold, so as to report any
occasion on which the temperature crosses the limits of a rated

temperature range, said apparatus being characterized in that a

common temperature detector is provided that delivers a common
warning signal, the temperature detector member including two 

thermostatic switches (16, 35) connected in parallel, one of which
closes the circuit for temperatures lower than said low threshold,

the other switch closing the circuit for temperatures higher than
said high threshold.
Apparatus according to claim 1, for detecting both when the
appliance crosses a low temperature threshold and also when the

appliance crosses a high temperature threshold, so as to report any
occasion on which the temperature crosses the limits of a rated

when the temperature approaches said predetermined threshold.
Apparatus according to claim 12, in particular for preventing the
electronic appliance from overheating while it is in use, said

apparatus being characterized in that said electronic circuit

a reference temperature, the microcontroller delivers a warning
message and/or switches to a mode temporarily preventing any use of

temperature of the environment of the electronic appliance, so as to
