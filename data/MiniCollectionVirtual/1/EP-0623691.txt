<ABSTRACT>
A continuous length anode is formed of relatively small valve metal wire 40 
having a electrocatalytic coating 42 braided into a highly flexible ribbon. The wire 

40 may be copper cored. The valve metal 41 is preferably titanium, although 
tantalum or niobium are also preferred. The coating 42 is preferably a mixed metal 

oxide coating. The braid is formed from wire sizes of from about .159 cm or less 
to about .3175 cm in diameter and the braided ribbon may be about .254 cm to 

about 15.24 cm wide. Four system applications are disclosed, two for steel 
reinforced concrete 60 and 80, one for a tank bottom 90, and one for a buried 

pipe 120. The braided anode may be used in combination with valve metal ribbon 
or bar 67 and 68 and may readily be electrically connected to power feeds or to 

itself by spot weld or crimp connections 252 and 253. Power feeds may be 
connected at a butt end or anywhere along the length of the braid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally as indicated to a cathodic protection
system using an anode, and more particularly, to a method using the system.Metal anodes of valve metals such as titanium, tantalum, or niobium, or
alloys thereof having electrocatalytic coatings of platinum metals, platinum metal
oxides, mixtures of valve metal oxides or other oxides with platinum metal oxides,
and so-called mixed crystal material for use in electrolytic processes have been of
much interest in recent years. By "valve metal" is meant a metal or alloy which,
when connected as an anode in an electrolyte and under the conditions in which
the metal or the alloy is subsequently to operate as an anode, exhibits the
phenomenon that within a few seconds of the passage of the electrolysis current
drops to less than 1% of the original value.By "electrocatalytic coating" is meant a coating material applied to the metal
base of the electrode, which will conduct an electrical current from the metal base
to the electrolyte, and which will catalyze an electrochemical reaction at the
surface of the electrode. Such a catalytic coating will prevent the passivation of
a valve metal electrode base when it is used as an anode.Valve metal anodes which include a noble metal or mixed metal oxide
electrocatalytic coating are used in cathodic protection. Such materials,
particularly with the coating, are expensive and somewhat difficult to fabricate.
Such coated metals come in a variety of forms such as tubes, bars, ribbons, wires,
or expanded mesh. Expanded mesh is now employed in steel reinforced concrete
systems as well as other applications. The mesh is formed from expanded sheet
and then coated and coiled into rolls for applications to a concrete deck. An
example is seen in Bennett et al U.S. Patent 4,900,410. The individual strands of 
such mesh are relatively small and subject to breakage. Because of the
roll set the mesh won't readily lay flat. It has to be cut with tin snips and
the rough and jagged edges present a fabricators' nightmare.GB-A-2 175 609 discloses an extended area electrode according to the
preamble of claim 1 and comprising a plurality of wires made of valve
metal. The wires are arranged in the form of an open mesh, and they are
provided on their surfaces with a material having anodically active properties.
The mesh structure is formed by weaving or knitting or comprises
a welded structure in the form of a network of individual strands welded
together where they cross. GB-A-2 175 609 further discloses the use of
such
