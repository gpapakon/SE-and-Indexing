<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
controlling the engine torque of a vehicle.
In particular, the
apparatus forming the subject of the present invention
relates to a strategy of control of the fuel inflow
towards the cylinders of the engine in order to pass from
a state of normal distribution of the fuel to a fuel cut-off
state and vice versa.As is known, in vehicles, attempts are being made
to bring about the fuel cut-off state when useful power
is not required of the engine, that is to say when the
accelerator pedal is completely released (that is to say
when the throttle of the air intake manifold reaches the
minimum position) and when at the same time the number of
engine revolutions is greater than a predetermined
threshold value. From the fuel cut-off state, a return is
made to the state of normal distribution of the fuel when
the accelerator pedal is pressed (that is to say when the
throttle of the air intake manifold moves from the
minimum position) or when the number of engine
revolutions is smaller than a predetermined threshold
value. Present-day apparatuses which allow passing from
the state of normal distribution of the fuel to that of
fuel cut-off and vice versa provide, in equal measure for
all the cylinders of the engine and after a predetermined
time or after a predetermined number of engine strokes,
for the cut-off (the increase) of 100% of the fuel in one
or two stages.According to what is described in European Patent Application N° 0510541 and in UK Patent
Application N° 2138176, it is known to progressively modify, during the recovery from a cut-off
condition, the fuel supply to the cylinders of an internal combustion engine in order to smooth
transients in engine output torque.GB-A-2138176 discloses an apparatus for progressively modifying, during recovery from a cut-off condition, the fuel supply by the use of different tables, taking into account the speed of variation of the number of engine revolutions.The apparatuses described above comprise a number
of disadvantages which manifest themselves in particular
in an unpleasantness in driving the vehicle due to abrupt
switching from the positive torque state to the negative
torque state and vice versa, which abrupt switching
causes jumps and kicks of the engine. It is clear that
the shaking of the engine does nothing but increase the
wear of the various parts of the engine. Moreover, in
passing from the fuel cut-off state to the state of
normal distribution, the quantity of fuel to be supplied
is defined in a single
