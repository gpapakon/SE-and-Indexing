<ABSTRACT>
A stapler has an elongated bottom part (10), a top part (14) swivellingly mounted on a rear bearing block (12) of the bottom part and an anvil plate (24) arranged in the front area of the bottom part (10), movable in its longitudinal direction into two end positions and provided with embossing dies (28, 30) for the legs of the ejected staples. In order to make it easier to handle the stapler when moving the anvil plate (24), grips (36) are shaped at the opposite longitudinal side edges (34) of the anvil plate and provided with perpendicularly bent gripping surfaces (40) facing into opposite directions. In order to move the anvil plate (24), the grips (36) can be simply held between thumb and index.

Stapler, having an elongated base part (10) with an 
upward directed broadside surface (26) and two laterally 

adjoining narrow side surfaces (44), having a top part 
(14) which is supported on a bearing block (12) at one 

end of the base part so as to be capable of swivelling 
about a transverse axis and has a magazine (16) for 

receiving staples as well as a driver (22) for ejecting 
the staples, and having an anvil plate (24) which, in the 

vicinity of the opposite end of the base part (10) to the 
bearing block (12), is displaceable in a longitudinal 

direction of said base part preferably into two detent or 
end positions and is provided, at its upward directed 

surface parallel to the top broadside surface (26) of the 
base part (10), with deformation stampings (28, 30) for 

the limbs of the ejected staples, there being provided on 
the opposing longitudinal side edges (34) of the anvil 

plate (24) handling lugs (36) which are bent down 
preferably at right angles towards, and at least 

partially overlap, narrow side surfaces (44) of the base 
part (10) and have handling surfaces (40) pointing in 

opposing directions, 
characterized by
 two openings (54) 
which are disposed in the region of the broadside surface 

(26) of the base part (10), are spaced longitudinally 
apart from one another and are separated from one another 

by a transverse web (62), two retaining lugs (50, 52) 
which are bent down substantially at right angles from 

the transverse edges (48) of the anvil plate (24) and 
engage down through the openings (54) in the base part 

(10), and a detent spring (58) which is clamped between 
the two retaining lugs (50, 52), overlaps the transverse 

web (62) on the underside of the base part (10) and may 
latch thereon into at least two detent positions, 

opposing pairs of longitudinally aligned lateral guide 
surfaces (68) for the retaining lugs (50, 52) being 

disposed or formed on the base part (10) in the region of 
the openings (54) and the opposing retaining lugs (50, 

52) on the transverse edges (48) of the anvil plate (24)  
 

having differing transverse dimensions and the pairs of 
lateral guide surfaces (68) being at a differing clear 

distance from one another which corresponds to the 
transverse dimensions of the associated retaining lugs 

(50, 52). 
Stapler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
handling lugs (36) take the form of bent-down edge 

portions of the anvil plate (24) which extend over the 
entire length of the anvil plate (24). 
Stapler according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
the anvil plate (24) together with its lateral handling 

lugs (36) has a U-shaped cross-sectional profile. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the handling lugs (36) each engage into an open-edged 
recess (42) of the narrow side surfaces (44). 
Stapler according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
handling surfaces (40) of the handling lugs (36) 

countersunk in the open-edged recess (42) are flush with 
the narrow side surfaces (44) or project beyond said 

surfaces by less than the material thickness of the 
handling lugs (40). 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized 
in that
 the handling surfaces (40) bear a roughening or 
corrugation (38). 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized 
in that
 the anvil plate (24) is countersunk in a recess 
of the broadside surface (26). 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the open-edged recesses (42) situated in the 
broadside surface (26) and in the narrow side surfaces  

 
(44) verge one into the other and are delimited by 

aligned front stop flanks for the anvil plate (24) and 
the lateral handling lugs (36) of the anvil plate. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized 
in that
 the anvil plate (24) is guided on two laterally 
spaced-apart, longitudinally aligned guide webs (46)

Stapler according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the 
guide webs (46) have a transversely curved top edge (47). 
Stapler according to claim 9 or 10,

characterized in that
 the 
transverse web (62) and the detent spring (58) carry, on 

their sides facing towards one another, complementary 
detent members (64, 66). 
Stapler according to claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the 
one, preferably web-side detent member (66) takes the 

form of a triangular rib having opposed run-on slopes.
