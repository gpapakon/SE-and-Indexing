wherein R² is aryl, heteroaryl or a group of the formula R²⁰ 

and R¹ is hydrogen, alkyl, a group of the formula -C(Y,Y¹)CH₂OH or -CH₂W, 
wherein one of Y and Y¹ is hydrogen and the other is alkyl or both Y and Y¹ 

are alkyl and W is cycloalkyl, aryl or allyl and pharmaceutically acceptable 
salts thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for reducing adverse effects 

of toxic injury to central neurons, particularly wherein the injury to central 
neurons is associated with ischemia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, epilepsy,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of compounds of the formula 
 
   wherein R2 is aryl, heteroaryl or a group of the formula R20: 
 
   and R1 is hydrogen, alkyl, a group of the formula -C(Y,Y1)CH2OH or 
-CH2W, wherein one of Y and Y1 is hydrogen and the other is alkyl or 
both Y and Y1 are alkyl and W is cycloalkyl, aryl, alkyl or allyl, 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the manufacture of a 
medicament for reducing adverse effects of toxic injury to central neurons, 
particularly wherein the injury to central neurons is associated with ischemia, 
hypoxia, hypoglycemia, epilepsy, Huntington's disease or Alzheimer's 
disease, or for treating convulsions. In another aspect, the invention relates to compounds of the formula: 
 
   wherein R2' is substituted or unsubstituted pyridyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, 
phenyl, or a group of the formula R20, and R1'is hydrogen, alkyl, or a 
group of the formula -C(Y,Y1)CH2OH, wherein one of Y1 and Y is  
 
hydrogen and the other is alkyl or both Yand Y1 are alkyl, provided that 
when R2' is pyridyl or phenyl, R1' is other than alkyl. The compounds of formula I, as described above, reduce adverse 
effects of neurotoxic injury and thus are useful in the treatment of convulsions 
and neuro-degenerative diseases, such as, stroke, ischemia, hypoxia, 
hypoglycemia, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral 
palsy, pulmonary surgery or cardiac arrest, perinatal asphyxia, Olivopontocerebellar 
atrophy, anoxia, such as, from drowning, spinal cord injury 
and poisoning by exogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) poisons, such 
as, some forms of lathyrism. The compounds of formule I are non-competitive 
NMDA receptor antagonists. Accordingly, they are particularly useful as agents 
in the treatment of convulsions, neurodegenerative disease states including 
neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, stroke or cerebral ischemia. Compounds of the invention are the non-opioid type of dextrorotatory 
morphinans having a ring system with the absolute stereochemistry of 9S, 
14S, 13S, as illustrated in formula I. As used herein, the term "alkyl", alone or in combination, denotes a 
straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, 
preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 
butyl and the like. The term "aryl", alone or in combination, denotes a group 
derived from an aromatic hydrocarbon such as, for example, phenyl or 
naphthyl, which may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more 
subs
