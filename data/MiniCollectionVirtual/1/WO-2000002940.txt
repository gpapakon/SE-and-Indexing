<ABSTRACT>
Microcellular polyurethane elastomers having sharply reduced or virtually no urea linkages may be prepared without resort to organic physical blowing agents by frothing a frothable mixture containing isocyanate reactive polyols and chain extenders, and a frothable isocyanate component. The isocyanate component is derived by reacting a stoichiometric excess of a di- or polyisocyanate with a polyol component containing an ultra-low unsaturation polyol. The froth-produced elastomers surprisingly exhibit greatly improved tear strengths, compression set, and other physical properties as compared to all water-blown microcellular elastomers of the same density.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PERMANENT GAS BLOWN MICROCELLULAR POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERSTechnological FieldThe present invention pertains to frothed microcellular polyurethane elastomers. More particularly, the present invention pertains to microcellular polyurethane elastomers prepared from low unsaturation polyoxyalkylene polyethers, and frothed with permanent gases. These microcellular elastomers are well suited for use as shoe sole components.Description Of The Related ArtMicrocellular polyurethane elastomers have numerous uses, for example as energy absorbing bumpers, automotive components such as head restraints and armrests, and in particular as shoe sole components. Prior to the Montreal protocol, it was possible to utilize volatile halocarbons such as CFC-11, CFC-22, methylene chloride, and the like as blowing agents to provide the numerous very fine cells characteristic of microcellular elastomers. However, the severe limitations placed on the use of halogenated hydrocarbons, and the increasing environmental concerns relative to the use of even the more environmentally friendly organic blowing agents has necessitated the development of water-blown microcellular elastomers. 

 In water-blown polyurethane microcellular elastomers, water present in the formulation reacts with a portion of the isocyanate component to generate an amine and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide serves as the blowing agent. However, the amine generated reacts with further isocyanate to produce urea linkages. The microcellular elastomer thus produced is not a polyurethane elastomer, but a polyurethane/urea elastomer containing substantial hard segment urea linkages. Such elastomers frequently are harder and less resilient than their all polyurethane counterparts. More importantly, however, the tear strength of such elastomers is limited. Tear strength is particularly important in applications such as those in the footwear industry.Polyurethane flexible foams have been air frothed for use in carpet backing and carpet underlay applications. However, such foams are not microcellular. The cell size is quite large, as evidenced by the much lower density of these foams, i.e. from about 0.015 g/cm3 to about 0.09 g/cm3, and the systems are highly filled to increase the load bearing capacity. The large cell sizes required of these foams coupled with the use of doctor blades and the like to regulate foam height results in a considerable degree of collapse of the cells. Contributing to both the large cell size as well as the propensity for these cells to
