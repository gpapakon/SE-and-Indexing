<ABSTRACT>
A multi-stage process for the digestion or conversion of organic matter which comprises supplying organic material-containing liquid/(with or without solid) feedstock mixture to an inlet port in a multi-stage reactor vessel, and causing microorganisms or catalytic agents to digest or otherwise convert said organic matter within the interior of said vessel to form liquid and/or gaseous by-product(s) characterised in that the reactor comprises an outer body portion defining an internal chamber and an inner rotatable rotor assembly, said rotor assembly comprising at least two spaced plate members affixed about a common central axis and constructed to divide the chamber into a series of three or more compartments, each compartment being bounded by a pair of oppositely located plate members or by a plate member and an end of said vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
Anaerobic digestion of organic matter to methane is
a widespread process in natural environments. Methane
production is a syntrophic process depending upon the action
of several types of microorganisms, for example anaerobic
bacteria.It is currently accepted that there are four steps
in the process, as shown in figure 1.The initial stage of hydrolysis is performed by a
variety of organisms, chiefly Clostridia. The majority of
the intermediary products of the second stage, acidogenesis,
are short chain fatty acids, hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
The third stage (acetification) is the result of metabolism
of fatty acids by H2-producing acetogenic bacteria. These
organisms are unable to grow at partial pressures of
hydrogen >10-3atm., thus their maintenance within the
methanogenic consortium depends on the continual removal of
hydrogen by methanogens. This is known as interspecies
hydrogen transfer.About 70% of the methane generated by the anaerobic
digestion of organic matter is produced from acetate by the
acetoclastic methanogens; the remainder is derived from H2
and CO2 by the action of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The
acetoclastic methanogens are very slow growing and thus a
high retention time is necessary for maximum methane
production.The pH for optimum growth of each member of the
anaerobic consortia differs widely. In the acidogenic phase
the optimal pH is 5, and pH 7 for the methanogenic phase.The digestion of organic matter is now described.Early digesters, see Figure 2, resemble septic
tanks in design. Most traditional digesters, Figure 2a,
were constructed in the form of up-right cylinder tanks into
which the feedstock was pumped and from which the effluent 
was removed. Gas was vented from the top of the cylinder.
In this type of digester very little mixing occurs, and a
distinct sludge layer settles at the bottom of the digester.
A thick layer of scum forms on top of the liquid fraction,
which restricts the working volume of the digester.The introduction of stirred digesters, Figure 2b,
resolved the problem of sludge settling and scum formation
and in addition produced a relative increase in methanogenic
activity. The increased metabolic turnover is due to better
mixing of the methanogenic flocs with the substrate. Most
digesters used for treatment of human or animal wastes are
now of this basic design.The use of anaerobic digestion as a treatment for
low-strength, high volume wastes such as those from food
processing plants causes the problem of washout of the
methanogenic consortia from

<CLAIMS>
A multi-stage process for the digestion or conversion
of organic matter which comprises supplying organic

material-containing liquid/ (with or without solid)
feedstock mixture to an inlet port in a multi-stage reactor

vessel, and causing microorganisms to
digest or otherwise convert said organic matter within the

interior of said vessel to form liquid and/or gaseous by-product(s)
wherein the reactor comprises an outer body

portion defining an internal chamber and an inner rotatable
rotor assembly, said rotor assembly comprising at least two

spaced plate members affixed about a common central axis and
constructed to divide the chamber into a series of three or

more compartments, each compartment being bounded by a pair
of oppositely located plate members or by a plate member and

an end of said vessel, characterised in that the reactor vessel is provided
with radially spaced scoops between at least one pair of

plate members.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the vessel is
a liquid/liquid or liquid/solid contactor.
A process as claimed in claim 2 wherein the contactor
has an inlet for influent feedstock and outlets for treated

effluent and for gas generated during the process.
A process as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein the
contactor has four compartments, or optionally has eight,

twelve, sixteen or twenty compartments.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein one
or more compartments are constructed and the process is

operated such that the four stages of anaerobic digestion,
hydrolysis, acidification, acetification and methanogenesis

are carried out in adjacent zones over the length of the 
internal chamber.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein one
or more of the following process parameters are controlled

or varied : pH, temperature, pressure, dilution of
feedstock, gas generation, gas venting, growth environment

for the particular member of anaerobic consortia.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim which is a
chemical conversion process wherein organic material within

the feedstock is converted to other organic material.
A process as claimed in claim 7 which is a continuous
anaerobic digestion process of organic matter.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
micro organisms comprise microbial species immobilised on a

support, such as support particles which are confined to
operate within either a given compartment of the reactor

vessel or within a given zone of the reactor which comprises
more than one compartment.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein
sludge from the downstream section of the reactor vessel is

recycled back to the start of the digestion phase.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 10
wherein different pH and temperature regions are established

over the length of the reactor vessel to provide
predetermined growth conditions for each member of the

microbial consortia.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim followed by
a recovery process in a similar but separate vessel as

defined in claim 1. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
feedstock comprises one or more of the following organic

material-containing liquid or liquid/solid compositions:

   processing industry wastes, human or animal wastes,
waste water treatment sludge, municipal or industrial

wastes, organic material-containing soil, and sewage sludge.
