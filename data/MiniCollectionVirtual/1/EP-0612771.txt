<CLAIMS>
Aqueous polymer dispersion for the production of 
low-emission emulsion paints, coatings and polymer 

emulsion renderings having the following features: 

the dispersion has a minimum film-forming temperature of 

<
 10°C; 
the polymer particles in the dispersion contain silanol 
and/or alkoxysilanol groups; 
the dispersion is obtained by emulsion polymerization of 
free-radical-polymerizable monom
ers in the aqueous phase 
as dispersion medium in the presence of an emulsifier, a 

free-radical-forming polymerization initiator and conventional 
auxiliaries; 
relative to the total monomers, 30 to 50% by mass of a 
hardening monomer, 47 to 67% by mass of a plasticizing 

monomer and 0.1 to 0.8% by mass of a vinylsilane are used 
in the polymerization, with the proviso that the hardening 

monomer and the plasticizing monomer are characterized 
in that the homopolymers respectively produced 

therewith have a glass transition temperature of 
>
 50 or 

<
 20°C; 
the dispersion is characterized in that, additionally, 
0.2 to 1.0% by mass of (meth)acrylamide and 1.0 to 2.5% 

by mass of acrylic acid, 2.0 to 4.0% by mass of methacrylic 
acid or 1.0 to 4.0% by mass of maleic acid are used. 
Polymer dispersion according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the vinylsilane is selected from the 

group comprising the vinyltrialkoxysilanes and vinylalkyldialkoxysilanes. 
Polymer dispersion according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that styrene, methyl methacrylate and/or 

vinyl chloride are used as hardening monomer and 1,3-butadiene, 
isoprene, alkyl (meth)acrylates, dialkyl  

 
maleates, dialkyl fumarates, vinyl esters and/or alkenes 

are used as plasticizing monomer. 
Polymer dispersion according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the polymerization is carried 

out semicontinuously with respect to the addition of 
monomer and initiator. 
Polymer dispersion according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the vinylsilane is metered in during 

the entire feed time of the other monomers. 
Polymer dispersion according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the polymerization is carried 

out in the presence of an anionic emulsifier or of an 
anionic and a nonionic emulsifier.
