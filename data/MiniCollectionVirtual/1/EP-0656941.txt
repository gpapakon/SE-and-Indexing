<ABSTRACT>
Methods, recombinant host cells and kits are disclosed for the production of members of specific binding pairs (sbp), e.g. antibodies, using display on the surface of secreted replicable genetic display packages (rgdps), e.g. filamentous phage. To produce a library of great diversity recombination occurs between first and second vectors comprising nucleic acid encoding first and second polypeptide chains of sbp members respectively, thereby producing recombinant vectors each encoding both a first and a second polypeptide chain component of an sbp member. The recombination may take place in vitro or intracellularly and may be site-specific, e.g. involving use of the l 
&
cir
&
 _o 
&
cir
&
 _x 
&
cir
&
 _P sequence and mutants thereof. Recombination may take place after prior screening or selecting for rgdps displaying sbp members which bind complementary sbp member of interest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for
producing members of specific binding pairs (sbp). In
particular, the present invention relates to methods for
producing members of specific binding pairs involving
recombination between vectors which comprise nucleic
acid encoding polypeptide chain components of sbp
members.Structurally, the simplest antibody (IgG)
comprises four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains
and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulphide
bonds. The light chains exist in two
distinct forms called kappa (K) and lambda (λ). Each
chain has a constant region (C) and a variable
region (V). Each chain is organized into a series of
domains. The light chains have two domains,
corresponding to the C region and the other to the V
region. The heavy chains have four domains, one
corresponding to the V region and three domains (1,2 and
3) in the C region. The antibody has two arms (each arm
being a Fab region), each of which has a VL and a VH
region associated with each other. It is this pair of V
regions (VL and VH) that differ from one antibody to
another (owing to amino acid sequence variations), and
which together are responsible for recognising the
antigen and providing an antigen binding site (ABS). In
even more detail, each V region is made up from three
complementarity determining regions (CDR) separated by
four framework regions (FR). The CDR's are the most
variable part of the variable regions, and they perform
the critical antigen binding function. The CDR regions
are derived from many potential germ line sequences via
a complex process involving recombination, mutation and
selection.It has been shown that the function of binding 
antigens can be performed by fragments of a whole
antibody. Example binding fragments are (i) the Fab
fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains;
(ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1
domains; (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and
VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (iv) the dAb
fragment (Ward, E.S. et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)
which consists of a VH domain; (v) isolated CDR regions;
and (vi) F(ab')2 fragments, a bivalent fragment
comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulphide
bridge at the hinge region.Although the two domains of the Fv fragment are
coded for by separate genes, it has proved possible to
make a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as
a single protein chain (known as single chain Fv (scFv);
