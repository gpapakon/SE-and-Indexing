element (12) having a contact surface to be able to 
travel so as to surface contact the fixed element at the 

contact surface thereof; any one of the fixed element 
(10,14) and the movable element (12) having a measuring 

part on their respective contact surfaces, the measuring

the central part of the contact surface, the location 
being different from the locations where the opening for 

the measuring part is provided; the fixed element 
(10,14) and the movable element (12) assuming two states 

in accordance with movement of the movable element (12) 

relative to the fixed element (10,14), the first state 
being assumed when the liquid sample is incorporated into 

and filled in the measuring part, the second state being 
assumed when the liquid sample filled in the measuring 

part is conveyed to the outside; the plurality of 
cleaning passageways being arranged in such a manner that 

the openings (ai,bi,ci,di,ei,fi) of the cleaning 
passageways filled with the cleaning liquid in any one of 

the fixed element (10,14) and the movable element (12) 
relatively travels, in accordance with the movement of 

itself, on the contact surface of the complementary 
counterpart element to clean their contact surfaces while 

cleaned areas are mutually joined together to make 
approximately one turn on the contact surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid sampling valves
for sampling a definite quantity of liquid samples like
blood, and more particularly to a liquid sampling valve
provided with a cleaning function and intended for stabilizing
the operation of analyzers for a long period.Analyzers like a hemocyte counting apparatus use a
liquid sampling valve for sampling liquid samples to extract
a definite quantity of such liquid samples in a tubularly
configured portion like a column.Referring to FIGs. 8 and 9, a brief description is given
on the construction and the operation of conventional liquid
sampling valves for general use. These liquid sampling valves
usually comprise two fixed elements 10, 14 and one movable
element 12 sandwiched between the two fixed elements 10, 14.
FIGs. 8 and 9 show two states of liquid sampling valves.Referring to FIG. 8, liquid samples flow in the direction
of an arrow A, namely through a pipette 15, an inflow
passageway Q1, a measuring passageway P1, and an outflow
passageway R1 to be filled in the measuring passageway P1
(referred to as a first state). The movable element 12 moves 
(rotates through a predetermined angle around a horizontal
rotation axis) to a state shown in FIG. 9 (referred to as a
second state). Samples filled in the measuring passageway P1
in the first state are conveyed in the direction of an arrow
B from the passageway S12 to the passageway S11 and then to
the outside of the sampling valve along with a definite
quantity of diluent liquid so that liquid samples are diluted
by a definite rate.In conventional liquid sampling valves, the contact
surfaces of the fixed elements and the movable element are
gradually stained with samples along with an increase in the
frequency of usage. When the contact surfaces are stained to
a certain degree, disadvantages occur such as leakage of
liquid samples from the contact surfaces, which prevents a
favorable sampling operation. Conventionally, sampling valves
have been regularly decomposed so that the contact surface of
each element is cleaned with a cleaning liquid thereby
preventing an unfavorable operation.Liquid sampling valves intended for automation of self-cleaning
are described in the following U.S. Patent Publications.
