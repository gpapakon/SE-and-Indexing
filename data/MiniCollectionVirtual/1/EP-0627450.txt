<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the preparation of copolymers based on ethylenically unsaturated and copolymerisable monomers whose macromolecules contain at least 21 % by weight of carboxyl-carrying monomer units, by free-radical-initiated emulsion copolymerisation in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) dissolved in the aqueous phase, and isolation of the copolymers in aqueous dispersion form, and, if necessary, subsequent removal of water by spray-drying giving redispersable (wettable) copolymer powders. The invention also relates to the use of the copolymers, with conversion into their water-soluble salt forms, as thickeners having a surprisingly advantageous rheology-modifying action in aqueous systems.
