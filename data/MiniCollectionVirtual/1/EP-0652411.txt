<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for removing surface water from plastic strands which, after running through a cooling-liquid section (5), are fed to a granulating apparatus, is designed for subjecting the surface of the strand to an air stream with transporting means fastened on a framework (11) for guiding the plastic strands and with a plurality of blowing nozzles arranged closely together at a setting angle (angle of incidence) in the transporting direction obliquely with respect to the plane of the strand guidance path. To achieve a uniform drying effect, two rows of blowing nozzles (7, 8) are provided at a small distance from the strand guidance path in a perpendicular plane running transversely with respect to the strand guidance path. The said blowing nozzles take the form of whole-type nozzles (45) and are respectively arranged in the same direction on a compressed-air pipe (17, 18) respectively above and below the strand guidance path on the upper and lower support (12, 12a, 13, 13a) of the framework (11). These nozzles respectively form an air curtain, the two air curtains having a common point of intersection within the strand guidance path.

An apparatus for the removal of surface water on plastic strands (4),

a) which are supplied to a pelletizer after passing through a coolant
section (5),
b) with conveying means (10) mounted on a frame (11) for the guidance
of the plastic strands (4) on a strand guiding path (9) in a conveying

direction (25),
c) with several first blowing nozzles (7) disposed above, and at an
angle to, the strand guiding path (9) for the actuation of the strand

surfaces by an air jet, and
d) with several second blowing nozzles (8) disposed below, and at an
angle to, the strand guiding path (9) in the form of hole-type nozzles

(45) for the actuation of the strand surfaces by an air jet, characterized
in that
e) the conveying means (10) are rollers (10), and
f) in that the first blowing nozzles (7) are hole-type nozzles (45),
g) the first and second blowing nozzles (7, 8)


i) being disposed in a plane substantially perpendicular to the
conveying direction (25), and at a small distance from the

strand guiding path (9),
ii) acting on the strand surfaces by an air jet counter to the conveying
direction (25), and
iii) each being disposed equidirectionally on air pipes (17, 18),
which, above and below the strand guiding path (9), are fixed

to upper and lower beams (12, 12a, 13, 13a) of the frame (11)
and which are connected with a side-channel blower (30), and 

each forming an air curtain, both air curtains having a joint
point of intersection within the strand guiding path (9).
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the blowing
nozzles (7, 8) are fixed and inserted in supply drill holes formed in the air

pipe (17, 18), blowing counter to the conveying direction of the plastic
strands (4) at an angle α of 30° to 60°, preferably approximately 45°, relative

to the normal of the path.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
the air pipes (17, 18) are pivotally mounted on beams (12, 12a and 13, 13a,

respectively) of the frame (11) and, by a compressed air supply (28), are
connected with a compressed air generator in the form of a side-channel

blower (30) disposed in the base portion of the frame.
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that the beam (12a)
disposed above the strand guiding path is pivotally lodged in a hinge (31)

mounted on the frame (11) on the strand exit side.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 comprising a troughshaped
collecting tank (26) for the discharge of coolant and provided

closely below the guiding path and fixed to the frame (11), characterized in
that the collecting tank (26) is formed to have a vent opening (27).
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized by the use of a number
of a component in the form of a multinozzle (24) having several blowing

nozzles (7, 8) disposed in a line. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the strand guiding
path consists of a roller path comprising at least two rollers (10), which

are individually and adjacently allocated to the blowing nozzles (7, 8), and
the surface area of which has receiving grooves (16) for the plastic strands

(4), a brush strip (23) being allocated to the roller (10) on the inlet side in
the conveying direction.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the blowing
nozzles (7, 8), at right angles to the strand guiding path, are directly topped

by a shielding which consists in each case of a deflector plate (33, 34)
tightly connected with the upper and lower beams (12, 12a, 13, 13a) by

way of fastening means (44) provided with straps (35, 36).
An apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that by way of the
fasteners (44), the deflector plates (33, 34) are adjustable in their distance

from the strand guiding path.
An apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that the deflector
plate (37), which is disposed upstream of the upper blowing nozzles (7)

above the strand guiding path, can be elevated automatically, together with
the blowing nozzles (7), by way of a parallel guide (32) that is articulated

to the frame (11).
