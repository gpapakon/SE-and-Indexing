Process for determining hirudin and synthetic thrombin 
inhibitors in the blood, blood constituents or body 

fluids, characterised in that a prothrombin 
intermediate, a compound which splits prothrombin into 

meizothrombin, a salt thereof or a mixture of these 
compounds optionally together with buffers and/or 

other conventional additives are added to the blood, 
the blood constituent or the body fluid and the time 

elapsing from the addition to the beginning of 
clotting is measured, wherein meizothrombin, PIVKA 

meizothrombin or meizothrombin des-fragment 1 is used 
as the prothrombin intermediate. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the blood or blood constituent contains heparin. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that meizothrombin, PIVKA meizothrombin or 

meizothrombin des-fragment 1 is used as the 
prothrombin intermediate and a snake venom is used as 

the compound which splits prothrombin into 
meizothrombin. 
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that 
ecarin is used as the snake venom. 
Means for performing the process according to one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that it contains a 

prothrombin intermediate, a compound which splits 
prothrombin into meizothrombin, a salt thereof or a 

mixture of these compounds together with buffers 
and/or other conventional additives, wherein it 

contains meizothrombin, PIVKA meizothrombin or 
meizothrombin des-fragment 1 as the prothrombin 

intermediate and snake venom as the compound which 
splits prothrombin into meizothrombin.  

 
Means according to claim 5, characterised in that it 
contains ecarin as the snake venom. 
Use of a means containing a prothrombin intermediate, 
a compound which splits prothrombin into 

meizothrombin, a salt thereof or a mixture of these 
compounds to determine hirudin and synthetic thrombin 

inhibitors in the blood, blood constituents or body 
fluids. 
Use according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
means contains meizothrombin, PIVKA meizothrombin or 

meizothrombin des-fragment 1 as the prothrombin 
intermediate and/or snake venom as the compound which 

splits prothrombin into meizothrombin. 
Use according claim 8, characterised in that the means 
contains ecarin as the snake venom.
