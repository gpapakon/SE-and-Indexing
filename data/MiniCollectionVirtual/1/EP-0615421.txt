<ABSTRACT>
A stabilizer (18) for stabilizing a surgical instrument extending through tissue of an anatomical cavity wall includes an expandable outer member (74) disposed on the surgical instrument and an inner member (72) disposed between the outer member and the surgical instrument for moving the outer member (74) between a contracted position allowing insertion of the outer member in the cavity wall and an expanded position resisting withdrawal of the outer member and the surgical instrument from the cavity wall. The outer member includes a plurality of legs (86), and protrusions (82) on the inner member (72) expand the legs (86) outwardly from the surgical instrument in the expanded position in response to movement of the inner member. Annular, tapered ribs (96) on the legs (86) bite into the tissue along the thickness of the cavity wall in the expanded position to lock the surgical instrument in place in the cavity wall. The legs (86) apply force to the protrusions in the expanded position causing the inner member to grip the surgical instrument for further stabilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to surgical instruments for
accessing cavities within the body and, more particularly, to
surgical instruments for establishing communication with an
anatomical cavity via insertion in a cavity wall.Surgical penetrating instruments are widely used in
surgical procedures to gain access to anatomical cavities
ranging in size from the abdomen to small blood vessels, such
as veins and arteries, epidural, plural and subachroniad
spaces, heart ventricles and spinal and synovial cavities.
Surgical penetrating instruments having a penetrating member
and a portal sleeve have become extremely popular for use in
establishing an endoscopic portal for many various procedures,
most notably laproscopic procedures, with access to an
anatomical cavity being established via the portal sleeve
positioned to extend through a wall of the cavity upon
penetration into the cavity by the penetrating member. Once
the portal sleeve extends through the thickness of the cavity
wall and projects into the cavity, it is desirable to stabilize
or secure the portal sleeve in the cavity wall to prevent
withdrawal or backing out of the portal sleeve from the cavity.
With the portal sleeve secured relative to the cavity wall,
insufflation of the cavity via the portal sleeve can be
accomplished with greater safety, deflation of the cavity due
to backing out of the portal sleeve can be prevented and, when
several portal sleeves are utilized, instruments can be
inserted via the portal sleeves without colliding in the
cavity. In addition to portal sleeves, essentially solid
members, such as uterine manipulators, are inserted in 
anatomical cavities via an opening therein for many surgical
procedures; and, frequently, it is desirable to stabilize or
lock the members in position to remain in the cavity during the
surgical procedures without backing out therefrom.Stabilizing devices including inflatable balloons or
membranes for contacting, in an expanded state, an internal
surface of tissue of a cavity wall and having bearing discs for
contacting an external surface of the tissue have been proposed
to secure surgical instruments relative to the cavity wall, and
U.S. Patents No. 5,002,557 to Hasson, 4,077,412 to Moosun,
3,459,175 to Miller and 3,253,594 to Matthews et al are
illustrative of such devices. Additionally, portal sleeves
having a spiral thread for engaging tissue of a cavity wall to
prevent the portal sleeves from slipping out of the cavity
after penetration by a trocar have been proposed, and exemplary

<CLAIMS>
In combination, a surgical instrument (20) comprising
a portal sleeve (24) for insertion through an opening in an

anatomical cavity wall (T), the portal sleeve having a distal
end (46) for being disposed in the anatomical cavity defined

by the anatomical cavity wall and a proximal end (48) for
being disposed externally of the anatomical cavity wall and

a stabiliser (18,100,130) for the instrument, the stabiliser
comprising


a body (72,74,102,104,182,134) mounted on the portal
sleeve; and
expandable means (86,114,146) on the body movable
between a contracted position for facilitating insertion of

the body into the cavity wall and an expanded position for
resisting withdrawal of the body from the cavity wall,

characterised in that the expandable means is designed, in
its expanded position, to engage the cavity wall along the

thickness of the cavity wall, and the body is movable
longitudinally along the portal sleeve to position the

expandable means in the opening prior to movement of the
expandable means from the contracted position to the expanded

position.
Combination according to claim 1, wherein the expandable
means includes a plurality of legs (86,114) disposed around

the portal sleeve and extending distally along the portal
sleeve in the contracted position and disposed outwardly from

the portal sleeve in the expanded position, to form a conical
configuration tapering to an apex.
Combination according to claim 2, wherein the body
includes an inner tubular member (72,102,132) slidably

disposed on the portal sleeve and arranged within an outer
tubular member (74,104,134), both members being movable,

together, along the portal sleeve, the legs (86,114) being
disposed on the outer tubular member.
Combination according to claim 3, wherein the outer
tubular member (74,104) includes an inner wall surface and

the inner tubular member (72,102) selectively engages and
disengages the inner wall surface in response to movement of 

the inner tubular member relative to the outer tubular
member.
Combination according to claim 4, wherein the inner
tubular member is rotatable or is longitudinally moveable

relative to the outer tubular member.
Combination according to claim 1, wherein the expandable
means includes a balloon (146) which is disposed along the

portal sleeve in the contracted position and outwardly from
the portal sleeve in the expanded position.
Combination according to claim 6, wherein the body
includes an inner tubular member (132) slidably disposed on

the portal sleeve and arranged within an outer tubular member
(134), both members being movable, together, along the portal

sleeve, the balloon (146) being carried on the outer tubular
member.
Combination according to claim 7, wherein the balloon
comprises a membrane (146) carried on the outer tubular

member and a fluid receiving chamber (152) is defined between
the membrane and the inner tubular member, and preferably the

stabiliser further includes means (154) for supplying fluid
to and allowing removal of fluid from the fluid receiving

chamber and which preferably includes a valve (158).
Combination according to any of claims 6 to 8, wherein,
in use, a portion of the balloon (146) in the expanded

position engages the cavity wall internally and the
stabiliser further includes a flange (140) on the body for

abutting the cavity wall externally, the cavity wall being
held between the portion of the balloon in the expanded

position and the flange.
Combination according to any of claims 2 to 5, wherein
the legs have a plurality of ribs (96) thereon facilitating

insertion of the body (72,74) into the cavity wall in the
contracted position and resisting withdrawal of the body from

the cavity wall in the expanded position.
Combination according to any of claims 2 to 5 or 10,
wherein the stabilizer further includes a stretchable

membrane (98) surrounding the legs (86).
