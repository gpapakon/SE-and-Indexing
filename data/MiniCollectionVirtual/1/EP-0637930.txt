<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning machine for treating goods with liquid only or with liquid mixed with granules which are heavier than the liquid, comprises a treating chamber (2), a pump device (3, 4) for circulating the liquid with or without granules and discharge thereof through nozzles (8) towards the goods in the treating chamber (2), and a collecting container (1) located beneath the treating chamber (2) and having a space (9) for liquid and granules, which space (9) communicates with said treating chamber (2). In order to provide a cleaning machine which, while permitting shifting in a simple manner between liquid with granules and liquid without granules while treating goods located in the treating chamber, also permits such shifting with only stationary members for obtaining the highest possible wear resistance, the space (9) for liquid and granules is by means of a separating means (10) divided into a section (11) containing granules and liquid and a section (12) containing only liquid, whereby the section (11) containing granules and liquid is connected with a first separate pump (4) in the pump device and the section (12) containing only liquid is connected with a second separate pump (3) in the pump device, for treatment with either granules and liquid or liquid only.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning machine 
for treating goods in accordance with the preamble of 
claim 1. A prior art device for separating granules from the 
circulating liquid flow is described in EP-B-0 169 847. 
In the tank where the liquid is collected, the granules 
sink to the bottom, and when the liquid and the granules 
are to be brought to the nozzles, the liquid is drawn 
from a lower level adjacent to the bottom of the tank so 
that the granules are drawn with the liquid, and when only 
the liquid is to be brought to the nozzles, the liquid 
is taken from a higher level well above the layer of granules 
at the bottom of the tank so that said granules 
are not drawn with the liquid flow. Another separating principle is described in SE-B-464 
387. A collecting container defines two spaces of 
which one at the top communicates with the treating chamber 
while the other at the top is separated from the treating 
chamber, and between said spaces there is provided 
a bottom groove which communicates with a pump, and a 
partition which permits flow of liquid between the two 
spaces and which is pivotable about a vertical axis between 
two end positions for preventing passage of the granules 
to the bottom groove in one end position and permit 
such passage in the other end position. One object of the invention is to provide a cleaning 
machine which permits shifting between liquid with granules 
and liquid without granules while treating goods located 
in the treating chamber. Another object is to provide a cleaning machine of 
only stationary members for obtaining the highest possible 
wear resistance. A further object is to be able to shift between cleaning 
with and without granules in a simple manner. A still further object is to be able to carry out an  
 
additional treatment with granules, when required, independent 
of the cleaning program set. According to the invention, for attaining said objects, 
a cleaning machine of the abovementioned type has 
received the characterizing features of claim 1. The invention will be further described below with 
reference to the accompanying drawing, in which 
fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of the lower portion 
of a cleaning machine according to the invention, 
showing the separated granules; and fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view of the collecting 
container with arrows showing the liquid flow while 
cleaning with liquid only. The cleaning machine illustrated in the drawings 
comprises a collecting container 1 which is situated

<CLAIMS>
Cleaning machine for alternative treatment of goods with 
liquid only or with liquid mixed with granules which are 

heavier than the liquid, said cleaning machine comprising 
a treating chamber (2), a pump device (3, 4) for circulating 

the liquid with or without granules and discharge 
thereof through nozzles (8) towards the goods in the treating 

chamber (2), and a collecting container (1) located 
beneath the treating chamber (2) and having a space (9) for 

liquid and granules, which space (9) communicates with said 
treating chamber (2) and which space (9) by means of a separating 

means (10) is divided into a section (11) containing 
granules and liquid and another section (12) containing 

only liquid, 
characterized in
 that the 
section (11) containing granules and liquid is connected 

with a first separate pump (4) in the pump device and the 
section (12) containing only liquid is connected with a 

second separate pump (3) in the pump device, for treatment 
with either granules and liquid or liquid only. 
Cleaning machine according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that the first and second pumps (4, 3) 
in the pump device are selectively operable for treatment 

of the goods in the treating chamber (2) either with granules 
and liquid by operation of said first pump (4) or with 

liquid only by operation of said second pump (3). 
Cleaning machine according to claim 2, 
characterized 
in
 that automatic or manual control means 
are provided for the selective operation of the first and 

second pumps (4, 3) in the pump device.  
 
Cleaning machine according to any of claims 1-3, 
characterized 
in
 that the first and second pumps 
(4, 3) in the pump device are provided in at least one closed 

space (18) in the collecting container (1). 
Cleaning machine according to claim 4, 
characterized 
in
 that, for facilitating separation, the 
closed space (18) for the first and second pumps (4, 3) in
