<ABSTRACT>
An induction heating coil (11) used in a floating zone 
melting method, characterized in that the path of a 

high-frequency current is controllable in the body 
surface of the coil and by the use of the coil a more 

uniform resistivity profile across the diameter is 
achieved as compared with those from the prior art. In 

the coil a second metal or alloy different in electric 
conductivity from a first metal or alloy of the coil is 

disposed in a predetermined place(s) to control the path 
of a high-frequency current, wherein the second metal or 

alloy has, for example, higher electric conductivity 
than the first metal or alloy and a long narrow and thin 

strip (18) made of the second metal or alloy is disposed 
in such a manner that it meanders on the body surface of 

the coil between the outer and inner peripheries 
periodically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an induction heating 
coil used as the heating device of a semiconductor single 
crystal grower and more particularly to an induction heating 
coil used for a crystal grower in which a dopant substance 
is uniformly dispersed in a grown crystal during the growth 
by FZ method ( an abbreviation of the so-called floating 
zone melting method ). An apparatus used for growing a semiconductor single 
crystal by FZ method comprises an upper shaft for holding a 
raw material rod, a lower shaft for holding a seed crystal 
made of a single crystal semiconductor having a smaller 
diameter and a heating device arranged such that it causes 
the raw material rod to fuse by heating. In growing a single crystal with the apparatus above-mentioned, 
an end of the raw material rod is fused to be  
 
connected to the free tip of the seed crystal to produce a 
molten zone and in succession a narrow single crystal rod 
portion is grown dislocation free on the seed crystal and 
then the raw material rod starts moving downward together 
with the seed crystal relative to the heating device to 
drive the molten zone toward the other end of its own along 
the rod, while being rotated about its axis and thereby 
almost the whole length is crystallized in the shape of a 
rod. An apparatus for growing a crystal rod requires that a 
raw material is fully fused without any core portion left 
not fused within a narrow molten zone therein during zone 
melting. Therefore, as a heating device, which meets the 
requirement, for example, an induction heating coil having a 
construction of a single turn and being flat is well known 
in the prior art. Such well known induction heating coils include, for 
example, an induction heating coil 1 as shown in Fig. 2, 
wherein a hollow conductor 4 is bent in the shape of a ring 
and both of the ends are located face to face with a gap 3 
interposed therebetween in the closest relation that does 
not cause undesirable sparks with each other. The induction  
 
heating coil is electrically connected to a pair of power 
source terminals 5 at the two respective points on the outer 
vertical surface in the vicinity of both the coil ends and 
the section in parallel with the radial direction is in the 
shape of a wedge ( the Japanese second publication No.51-24964, 
hereinafter referred to as the first prior art). Such a construction of the coil of the first prior art 
may give rise to a current path almost a perfect geographic 
symmetry to the coil center in the surface of
