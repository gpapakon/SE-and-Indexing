<ABSTRACT>
A DRAM comprises: a memory cell array divided into a 
plurality of banks (34, 35) each having a plurality 

of dynamic type memory cells arranged into substantially 
a matrix pattern, data being writable in and readable from 

each memory cell and further the data written in the memory 
cells being refreshable; activating sections (28, 30) for 

activating the memory cells to be read, written and refreshed; 
precharging sections (29, 31) for precharging data 

lines connected to the memory cells to be read; and command 
detecting circuits (1, 6, 12, 18, 23) for detecting commands 

and outputting control signals corresponding to the 
detected commands, to operate the DRAM in correspondence 

to the respective commands, each of a plurality of command 
detecting circuits (1, 6, 12, 18, 23) being provided for 

a plurality of the banks in common to detect one command. 
In a computer system having a high speed CPU, for instance, 

since the CPU and memory can be activated by use of a 
single clock, it is possible to realize a high speed memory 

so as to correspond to the high speed CPU, by simplifying 
the clock control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a Dynamic Random Access Memory
(DRAM) according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a DRAM is
known from US 4,961,167. In such a DRAM a self-refresh method
is carried out. This self-refresh method is a refresh method
wherein, when external refresh signals to the DRAM are
missing, self-generated internal refresh signals are used for
performing the refresh of memory cells. Such a high speed
semiconductor memory device (DRAM) is suitable for use with a
relatively small-scale system provided with a high speed CPU,
for instance for use with a mini-computer, work station etc.
However, since only a conventional self-refresh method is
carried out, the operation speed of the memory device
crucially depending on the speed of data reading, is low.Recently, the operating speed of the CPU has been
improved markedly to such an extent as to exceed the
operating speed of DRAMs, with the result that there arises
a problem in that the operating speed of the DRAM is slower
than that of the CPU.To overcome the above-mentioned problem, various
configurations have been so far considered such that the
main memory section including DRAMs is composed of a
plurality of banks, the memory device is operated in an
interleave mode, etc. In the conventional configuration
as described above, however, since the operating speed of
the memory device has been apparently increased relative
to that of the CPU by executing the memory access to a
plurality of banks only in parallel to each other, there
exist other problems in that the control method of the
memory device and further the peripheral circuits of the
memory device have been both complicated.In particular, when the conventional memory device is
incorporated with a relatively small-scaled computer system
(e.g., minicomputer, work station, etc.), the system is
complicated in particular. In more detail, when the memory
bank access method or the memory interleave method is
adopted for the relatively small-scaled system, the
hardware configuration becomes complicated, so that the
system cost and the system size both increases.In addition, when the operating frequency of the CPU  
has been increased to the degree of 50 MHz or 100 MHz, it
is not easy to utilize the memory device effectively. In
other words, a more ingenious memory architecture is
required for a high operating speed CPU, so that the memory
system is further complicated.On the other hand, the memory device of pipeline
operation has been so far proposed to overcome the problem
with respect to the memory
