<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions for preferentially targeting the delivery of a substance to a sub-population of mammalian cells. The vehicle of the invention includes a targeting moiety capable of associating with or forming an envelope defining a compartment that contains the substance to be delivered to the sub-population of cells. The targeting moiety also contains a domain capable of interacting with a member of a binding pair located on the surface of the sub-population of cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TARGETING SPECIFIC TISSUEThis invention was made with Government support under Grant No. AM-16666, awarded by the National Institute of Health. The Government has certain rights in this invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention is directed to methods and compositions for preferentially targeting the delivery of a substance, such as a nucleic acid, to specific tissue.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn the field of gene therapy, viral vectors and liposomes have been proposed to introduce genes into cells (Williams, D.A. (1988) Hematoloαv/Oncolo v Clinics of North America 2 : 211-281; and Mannino, R.J. et al . (1988) BioTechniques 6_:682-690) . Although such approaches may in some instances result in a localized administration of the vector or liposome, e.g., a viral vector administered via inhalation for localized delivery to lung tissue, a major drawback to such approaches is that there is no tissue- specific tropism. Thus, the DNA contained in the viral vector or liposome can be delivered non-specifically into many different types of cells.Many genetic diseases are manifested in one tissue type and inserting genes non-specifically into many different cell types is not only unnecessary, but may be harmful under certain circumstances (Selden, R.F. et al . (1987) New Enσl. J. Med. 317:1067-1076) .In addition, it is believed that most cancers originate from one cell type. At present, chemotherapy is the most widely-used approach to control cancer. Such chemotherapy, however, is not tissue specific in terms of delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent. Rather, the adverse effects 

 imparted upon the rapidly dividing cancer cells are also imposed upon normal cells.Although one recent publication reported the use of a protein covalently coupled to DNA to target liver cells, this approach resulted in low efficiency in DNA uptake compared to the higher efficiency attainable with viral vectors (Wu, G.Y. et al . (1988) J. Biol . Chem 263:14621-14624) .Given the state of the art, it is apparent that a need exists for methods and compositions for targeting the delivery of various substances to specific cell types.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention herein to provide vehicles for targeting the delivery of a substance to specific cell types. More particularly, it is an object of the invention to provide methods and compositions for targeting the delivery of a substance such as a nucleic acid or a therapeutic agent to a sub-population of mammalian cells contained within a living

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A vehicle for preferentially targeting the delivery of a substance to a sub-population of mammalian cells characterized by the presence of a first member of a binding pair on the surface of said sub-population, said vehicle comprising an envelope comprising a recombinant targeting moiety defining a compartment and a substance contained in said compartment, wherein said targeting moiety comprises first and second domains not naturally associated with each other and wherein said first domain forms or associates with the envelope defining said compartment and said second domain comprises a second member of said binding pair or portion thereof which targets said vehicle to said sub-population of mammalian cells.
2. The vehicle of Claim 1 wherein said vehicle is capable of transferring said substance into said cell.
3. The vehicle of Claim 1 wherein said substance is a therapeutic agent.
4. the vehicle of Claim 3 wherein said therapeutic agent is a nucleic acid.
5. The vehicle of Claim 2 wherein said substance comprises a recombinant viral genome.
6. The vehicle of Claim 1 wherein said envelope comprises a membrane.
7. The vehicle of Claim 1 wherein said envelope comprises a viral coat protein.
8. The vehicle of Claim 7 wherein said viral coat protein comprises a viral envelope protein. 


 9. The vehicle of Claim 7 wherein said first domain of said targeting moiety comprises a portion of a viral coat protein.
10. The vehicle of Claim 9 wherein said viral coat protein comprises a viral envelope protein.
11. A method for preferentially targeting the delivery of a substance to a sub-population of mammalian cells characterized by the presence of a specific surface receptor for a ligand, said method comprising contacting a population of mammalian cells containing said sub- population with any one of the vehicles of Claims 1 through 10 and 12 wherein said receptor and said ligand comprise said first and said second members of said binding pair.
12. The vehicle of Claim 1 wherein said binding pair comprises erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor.
