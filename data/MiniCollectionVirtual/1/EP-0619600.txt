<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention provides a method of etching boron 
nitride which comprises doping a layer of boron nitride with 

an element from Group IVA of the Periodic Table of the 
Elements, such as silicon, carbon, or germanium. After the 

boron nitride layer is doped, it can be etched with techniques 
such as wet etching with hot phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric 

acid, or buffered hydrofluoric acid, which was not possible 
prior to doping the boron nitride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for etching boron nitride, 
and more particularly to a method of enhancing the etch rate 
of boron nitride. This is accomplished by doping the boron 
nitride with an element from Group IVA, such as silicon, 
carbon, or germanium, for example. In the field of semiconductor device fabrication, it is common 
to utilize insulation layers to separate conductive layers. 
Silicon nitride layers applied by plasma-enhanced chemical 
vapor deposition (PECVD) have been used as such inter-layer 
insulation films. These silicon nitride films have good 
insulation characteristics as well as high blocking effects 
against moisture and alkali metal ions. In addition, silicon 
nitride insulation layers exhibit conformal step coverage and 
high cracking resistance characteristics. See M. Maeda and T. 
Makino, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics 26: 660-665 
(1987). However, there are some drawbacks to silicon nitride 
insulation layers. Such drawbacks include a relatively high 
dielectric constant compared with phosphorous-silicate glass 
(PSG) and silicon dioxide insulation layers, leading to 
relatively large parasitic capacitance and relatively long 
propagation delay times between devices. See M. Maeda and T. 
Makino. A need for other dielectric or insulation film materials with 
low dielectric constants, conformal step coverage 
characteristics, good insulation characteristics, and high 
cracking resistance thus continued to exist. In response to 
this need, boron nitride films prepared by atmospheric  
 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or PECVD were devised. These 
boron nitride films were highly insulating, chemically inert, 
and thermally stable. The films also exhibit a low dielectric 
constant. However, in order to be useful the boron nitride films must be 
compatible with current semiconductor device fabrication 
processes. Therefore, suitable etching techniques must be 
available. Wet etching processes are common in semiconductor device 
fabrication processes. Common wet etchants include 
hydrofluoric acid (HF), buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF), and 
hot phosphorus acid, for example. These etchants show little 
ability to etch boron nitride, and therefore current 
fabrication processes are not compatible with the use of boron 
nitride insulation layers. A need thus exists for a method of etching boron nitride using 
conventional etchants so that boron nitride can be used in the 
fabrication of semiconductor devices. The ability to etch 
boron nitride will allow the material
