<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus which includes a station (1) for pouring in the first component, a station (8) for pouring in the second component and a metering device (4) between the two pouring stations for metering out carbon dioxide snow, the metering device being composed of at least one nozzle (3) on the upper end of a hollow body which is open at the bottom and having in addition a carbon dioxide snow suction device (5) upstream of the point at which metering of the second component occurs.

Process for the continuous production of a multi-layer 
food product having two constituents located one above the 

other, wherein the constituent having the greater density 

is disposed above a layer having a low density, wherein a 
container (14) is first filled with the first constituent 

(1) and then with the second constituent (8) and, before 
the metering-out of the second constituent, the surface of 

the first constituent is frosted with the aid of CO
2
 snow, 
characterised in that a maximum of 30 seconds elapses 

between the dispensing of the two constituents and that the 
residue of CO
2
 snow is removed by suction. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
action time of the CO
2
 snow is between 5 and 20 seconds. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the metering-out of CO
2
 snow occurs once only in a quantity 
of 0.1-0.2 g/cm
2
. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the metering-out of CO
2
 snow occurs cyclically or 
continuously. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
difference in the density of the two constituents lies 

between 0.2 and 0.8. 
Process according to claim 1 or 5, characterised in that 
the constituent lying underneath is mousse or yoghourt and 

the constituent lying on top is jelly or chocolate. 
Device for carrying out the process according to one of 
claims 1 to 6, consisting of a station (1) for dispensing 

the first constituent, a station (8) for dispensing the 
second constituent and a metering device (4) between the 

two dispensing stations for metering-out CO
2
 snow, 
characterised in that the metering device (4) consists of  

 
at least one nozzle (3) at the upper end of an open-bottomed 

hollow body and that it additionally has, before 
the metering-out of the second constituent, a device for 

removing the CO
2
 snow by suction. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that it 
operates cyclically. 
Device according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that 
the nozzle (3) lies at a distance of between 20 and 80 cm 

from the surface of the first constituent (15). 
Device according to one of claims 7 to 9, characterised 
in that the suction-type removal device (5) consists of a 

cylindrical hollow body which has, in the vicinity of the 
surface of the first constituent, at least two nozzles for 

the introduction of compressed air (6).
