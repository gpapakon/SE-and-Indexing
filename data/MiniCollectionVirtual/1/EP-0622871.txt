<ABSTRACT>
Module terminals (2) comprising a column of right 
angle contacts (42, 44, 46, 48, 50) are assembled to a 

housing module for receiving post header terminals at one 
end and inserted into complimentary holes of a printed 

circuit board on the other end. Interposed between 
adjacent terminal modules (2) are shielding members (58) 

that serve to limit crosstalk between adjacent rows of 
contacts. Each shielding member (58) is attached to an over-moulded 

insulative web (12) of a terminal module (2) and is 
resiliently biased thereagainst so as to ensure good 

contact of an integral grounding pin (62) with one of the right 
angle contacts (46) of the terminal module (2) and also to 

ensure a flush fit of the shielding member (58) against the 
terminal module (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shielding plates that are
mountable to terminal modules of an electrical connector
assembly, serving to shield columns of adjacent terminals
from crosstalk.It is common, in the electronics industry, to use
right angled connectors for electrical connection between
two printed circuit boards or between a printed circuit
board and conducting wires. The right angled connector
typically has a large plurality of pin receiving terminals
and at right angles thereto, pins (for example compliant
pins) that make electrical contact with a printed circuit
board. Post headers on another printed circuit board or a
post header connector can thus be plugged into the pin
receiving terminals, making electrical contact
therebetween. The transmission frequency of electrical
signals through these connectors is very high and requires
not only balanced impedance of the various contacts within
the terminal modules to reduce signal lag and reflection
but also shielding between rows of terminals to reduce
crosstalk.Impedance matching of terminal contacts has already
been discussed in document EP-A-0422785. Cost effective
and simple designs of right angle connectors has also been
discussed in EP-A-0422785, whereby the modular design
makes it easy to produce shorter or longer connectors
without redesigning and tooling up for a whole new
connector, but only producing a new housing part into
which a plurality of identical terminal modules are
assembled. As shown in the aforementioned document,
shielding members can be interposed between adjacent
terminal modules. This requires, however, either an insert
to replace the shield or a thicker terminal module to take
up the interposed shielding gap if the shielding is not
required. The shielding disclosed in EP-A-0422785 has a 
pin receiving terminal end that is inserted into a housing
module cavity, and a pin contact end for contacting the
printed circuit board. This shield is relatively expensive
to manufacture and assemble.With respect to the above mentioned disadvantages,
the object of this invention is to provide a simple, cost
effective shield for mounting between terminal modules of
a right angled connector assembly.A further object of this invention, is to provide a
shield that makes a reliable and effective electrical
connection between a grounding circuit and the shield.Yet another object of this invention is to provide a
terminal module that can be assembled to a module housing
with or without shielding, without requiring use of an
insert or another

An electrical connector assembly comprising an insulating
housing, a plurality of terminal modules (2) assembled thereto, each

terminal module (2) having a plurality of contacts (4), each of which
comprises a mating contact portion (6), a conductor connecting

portion (8) and therebetween an intermediate portion (10), and an
insulative web (12) that encapsulates some or all of the intermediate

portions (10); and an electrically conductive shield between adjacent
terminal modules (2), characterised in that the electrically conductive

shield (58) is fixed to a terminal module by mounting means (56,57)

web (12) of the module, the shield (58) being prestressed when
mounted to the insulative web (12) by the mounting means

(52,54,56,57) so as to be resiliently held against the terminal module

mounting means (56,57) when the shield (58) is not mounted to the
terminal module (2), and the base (76) is elastically bent by an angle

(H) away from the mounting means (56,57) such that the base (76)
forms an angle (G) equal to (H) plus (F) therewith when the shield is

mounted to the terminal module (2).
