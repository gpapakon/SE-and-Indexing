<ABSTRACT>
A push-pull Class E amplifier (13) is used to provide an efficient transfer of power to the induction coil (14) in an electrodeless discharge lamp and to reduce the amount of radio frequency interference emitted by the lamp into the surrounding environment. A bifilar or other type of multifilar induction coil (14), preferably center-tapped, is used to further reduce the radio frequency interference problem.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrodeless discharge
lamps and in particular to an arrangement for a highly
efficient electrodeless discharge lamp which generates
acceptable levels of radio frequency interference.Electrodeless discharge lamps operate by using an
induction coil to couple electromagnetic energy to a gas
mixture, typically a metal vapor and an inert gas, which
is enclosed in a sealed vessel. An oscillator is used to
generate a high frequency signal which is amplified and
delivered to the induction coil. Generally speaking, the
lamp operates in two stages. In the start-up stage, the
induction coil produces an electric field which ionizes
some of the gaseous molecules, creating ions which in turn
collide with other molecules, thereby producing further
ions. This process continues until the steady-state stage
is reached wherein a plasma of circulating charged
particles is maintained, primarily by the magnetic field
emanating from the induction coil. The stream of charged
particles excites the metal vapor atoms, producing
radiation, primarily in the UV spectrum, which impinges on
a layer of phosphors which coats the walls of the vessel.
As a result, the phosphors are excited and produce visible
light.This type of lamp is known as an electrodeless
fluorescent lamp. Other types of electrodeless discharge 
lamps produce visible light directly from the gas
contained in the sealed vessel.Electrodeless discharge lamps, and in particular
electrodeless fluorescent lamps, are much more efficient
and long-lived than incandescent lamps. An electrodeless
fluorescent lamp, for example, has a luminous efficacy of
60-80 lumens/watt, whereas tungsten incandescent lamps
typically have a luminous efficacy of only 15-17
lumens/watt. Electrodeless discharge lamps accordingly
offer the prospect of very significant energy savings.
The development of this technology has been limited,
however, by several problems, the foremost of these being
the generation of radio frequency interference (RFI). The
induction coil acts as an antenna. Even if the lamp
operates at frequencies which are approved by the FCC
(e.g., 6.78 or 13.56 MHz), the lamp typically generates
harmonics of the fundamental frequency which are not
within approved wavebands. Another problem has been to
minimize losses which occur in the amplification of the
high-frequency signal before it is delivered to the
induction coil. These problems have been particularly
troublesome because the apparatus used to solve them must
fit within the confines of an electric
