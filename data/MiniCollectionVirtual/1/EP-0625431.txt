<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a security paper (15) having an embedded security thread (7), which is embedded in the paper in such a way that it is freely accessible in some regions. The security thread (7) has a width which is greater than 2 mm. The security paper (15) consists of at least two layers of paper (6, 9), which are produced on separate paper systems. The security thread (7) is embedded in the first layer of paper (6), which has openings (16) or recesses in its surface, through which the thread is partially accessible on both sides. This first layer of paper (6) is covered with at least one second layer of paper (9) and joined firmly to the latter, the second layer of paper (9) having a thickness of 10 to 50%, preferably 20%, of the total thickness of the security paper (15). By means of the use of particularly wide security threads and the associated possibility of providing the threads with specific optical effects, the security against falsification of the security paper (15) equipped therewith can be improved.

An antifalsification paper having an embedded safeguarding band embedded in
the paper so as to be freely accessible at least in part, the safeguarding band

(19, 26) being permeable to liquids in the edge area of one or both sides in the
longitudinal direction of the band over the entire length of the band, these permeable

areas being anchored in the fiber compound of the antifalsification paper
(23, 25), and the band (19, 26) having at least one area of substantially

constant width (21) which is impermeable to liquids and extends over the entire
length of the band, the width of the impermeable area being at least great

enough so that this area is not covered by paper fibers of the paper web in
which the band is embedded.
The antifalsification paper of claim 1, characterized in that the liquid-impermeable
area of the band (19) is covered at least on one side by an additional

paper layer (27, 28).
The antifalsification paper of claim 2, characterized in that at least one of the
additional paper layers (27, 28) has at least one window (16).
The antifalsification paper of claim 1, characterized in that the safeguarding
band (26) is anchored in the paper (25) on only one side.
The antifalsification paper of any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
safeguarding band (19, 26) is equipped with optically variable effects, in particular

diffraction patterns, holograms or interference effects.
The antifalsification paper of any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
safeguarding band (19, 26) is equipped with printed images, in particular negative

or positive characters.
The antifalsification paper of any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
safeguarding band (19, 26) contains a metal layer.
The antifalsification paper of any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
safeguarding band (19, 26) contains fluorescent, in particular daylight fluorescent,

substances. 
The antifalsification paper of any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the liquid-permeable
areas (20) are additionally fiber-permeable.
A method for producing the antifalsification paper of claim 1, characterized in
that


in a first method step a paper web is formed, a safeguarding band being
embedded in the paper during sheet forming, the band being permeable to

liquids in at least one of its edge areas alone the running direction of the
band over the entire length of the band, but impermeable to liquids outside

this edge area, and the band running during incorporation over a
tracklike raised area in the wire which is narrower than the safeguarding

band so that the at least one permeable edge area protrudes beyond the
raised area,
optionally parallel to the first method step one or two further paper webs
are formed which, after leaving the wire area, are brought together with

the first paper web and firmly connected therewith, and
in further method steps the paper is completed in the known way.
The method of claim 10, characterized in that the one or two further paper
webs have window areas which are brought to coincidence with the exposed

areas of the safeguarding band.
The method of claim 10 or 11, characterized in that the wire on which the first
paper web is formed has bumps that are narrower than the safeguarding band,

and the permeable areas of the safeguarding band protrude laterally beyond the
bumps.
The method of claim 10 or 11, characterized in that the raised area onto which
the safeguarding band runs is a raised ring area on the wire.
The method of any of claims 10 to 13, characterized in that the safeguarding
band runs onto the wire outside the pulp.
The method of any of claims 10 to 13, characterized in that the safeguarding
band is brought against the wire alter about 30% of the sheet forming is over.
A safeguarding band to be embedded in an antifalsification paper, having at
least one edge area (20) extending in the longitudinal direction of the band 

which is permeable to liquids and at least one further area extending in the longitudinal
direction of the band which is impermeable to liquids over the entire

length of the band, this area having a substantially constant width.
The safeguarding band of claim 16, characterized in that it is permeable to liquids
on both edges and impermeable to liquids in the middle area in the running

direction of the band.
