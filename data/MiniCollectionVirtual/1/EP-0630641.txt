<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming dental products, such as dentures, 
denture relines, dental crowns, dental bridges and dental restorative 

materials, temporary crown, temporary bridge, provisional crown or 
provisional bridge, from two polymerizable paste compositions each 

having a complimentary component of a free radical catalyst system 
and a polymerizable acrylic compound. One of these paste 

compositions includes an oxidizing agent and a stabilizer and the 
other includes a reducing agent as components of a redox catalyst 

system for free radical polymerization. These paste compositions 
are mixed in a static mixer to form a polymerizing paste 

composition, which is then shaped into a dental prosthesis. A 
handheld mixing dispenser useful in carrying
 out this method, 
includes a static mixing conduit, and two containers enclosing the 

polymerizable paste compositions. The static mixing conduit 
encloses a static mixing member. The containers are adapted to be 

connected in fluid flow communication with the static mixing 
conduit. In the paste composition which includes the reducing 

agent a photoinitiator may be preferably included. Each container is 
sufficiently oxygen permeable to maintain inhibition of 

polymerization of the polymerizable paste composition therein for at 
least 12 months at 23Â°C.
