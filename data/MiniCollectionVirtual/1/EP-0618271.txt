<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silicone rubber 
composition that can be used to make a silicone rubber 
having good processability, good molding 
characteristics, and good physical after curing. Since silicone rubber compositions can be 
used to make molded products having good resistance to 
both heat and cold, these compositions are used for 
applications requiring the above-mentioned properties. 
To improve both the processability and the molding 
properties of silicone rubber compositions, silicone 
rubber compositions containing fluorine resin powders 
were introduced by patent applications. For example, a 
conductive silicone rubber having an improved rolling 
processability and containing fluorine resin powder in 
the organopolysiloxane raw rubber is disclosed in JP-A 
58-194949. A rubber-type elastic material used for 
typing characters and having both good abrasion 
resistance and good dimensional stability, and 
containing fluorine resin powders such as 
polytetrafluoroethylene, in the silicone raw rubber is 
disclosed in JP-A 60-36171. However, when a large 
amount of fluorine resin powder is used, the viscosity 
of the silicone rubber composition becomes so high that 
both the processability and the molding properties are 
decreased. As a solution, this invention provides 
silicone rubber compositions with excellent physical 
properties after curing, as well as with good molding 
properties and processability. It is prepared by 
mixing fluorine resin powders and specific 
organopolysiloxane into a silicone composition 
containing vinyl functional diorganopolysiloxane and 
reinforcing silica.  
 This invention therefore introduces a 
silicone rubber composition, comprising (A) a 
diorganopolysiloxane containing vinyl groups (100 parts 
by weight), (B) a fluorine resin powder (0.01-50 parts 
by weight), (C) an organopolysiloxane (0.01-40 parts by 
weight) containing a unit of the following formula: 
F(CF2)aCH2CH2Si(Me)nO(3-n)/2 
wherein a is an integer of 4 or greater, n is 0 or 1 or 
2, and Me denotes a methyl group, (D) a reinforcing 
silica powder (10-100 parts by weight) having a 
specific surface area of at least 50 m2/g, and (E) a 
curing agent. The organopolysiloxane containing vinyl 
groups as component (A) of this invention can be any 
conventional organopolysiloxane used as the chief 
component of a silicone rubber. Examples include the 
following: dimethylpolysiloxane with terminal 
dimethylvinylsiloxy groups; copolymers of a 
dimethylsiloxane and methylvinylsiloxane, having 
terminal
