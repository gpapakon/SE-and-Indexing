<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel synthesis of 
the compounds of Formula (I): 


The compounds are produced in high yield and without utilizing 
expensive chromatographic separations. The synthesis is 

particularly advantageous because it is stereoselective.

<DESCRIPTION>
Therapeutically, an antagonist which possesses both
kinase selectivity for protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC isozyme
selectivity is a potentially useful pharmacological agent.
Hartenstein, J. H., et al., in "perspectives in Medicinal
Chemistry," 99-118 (1993), VCH Publishers, New York. Such an
antagonist of protein kinase C would be useful in treating
disease states in which PKC has been implicated. Lester, D.S.,
et al., "Protein Kinase C: Current concepts and Future
Perspectives", Ellis Horwood New York (1992). Specific isozymes
of protein kinase C have been implicated in cancer (Ahmed, et
al., Mol. Pharma., 43, 858-86 (1993), CNS diseases such as
Alzheimer's; Demaerschalck, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta.1181,
214-218 (1993), cardiovascular disease; (Natarajan et al. Mol.
cell. Endo., 101, 59-66 (1994)) and diabetic complications; King,
et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sciences (USA), 88:22, 11059-63 (1992).Recently, bisindolylmalimides of the formula:

have been recognized as PKC selective agents and have shown
promise as therapeutic agents for treating diseases implicated by
PKC. Bit, et al., J. Med. Chem.36:21 (1993). Wikinson S.E., et
al., Biochem J., 299, 335 (1993). Toullec, D., et al., J. Biol.
Chem., 266, 15771 (1991); Davis, P.D., et al., J. Med. Chem., 35,
177 (1992). A class of compounds that are potent and effective
inhibitors of PKC of the Formula (I):

These compounds are prepared by coupling a bisindolylmaleimide
with a linker of the Formula (II):

to form the N to N linked bisindolylmaleimide.Certain triol ethers of similar structure to the
compounds of Formula (II) are disclosed in Canadian Journal of
Chemistry, 1957, 35, p. 315-321 and Canadian Journal of
Chemistry, 1964, 42, p. 2025-2027.The present invention provides novel compounds of the
Formula (II) and the stereoselective synthesis of these
compounds. Under the preferred conditions, the compounds are
produced in high yield and without utilizing expensive
chromatographic separations. The synthesis is particularly
advantageous because it further provides a stereoselective route
of preparing the compounds of the Formula (I).The invention provides Compounds of the Formula:

wherein:
R2 is N3, NH-protecting group, amine protecting group,
or hydroxy protecting group; L1 is independently a leaving group;Z is -(CH2)n-; andn is independently 1, 2, or 3; R2 and L1 being different.The invention further provides a stereoselective
process of preparing these compounds, which comprises:
(a) Alkylating a compound of Formula (III):

with a lithium
