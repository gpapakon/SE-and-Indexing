<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent garment (20) includes a pair of strap members 
(40) and a garment shell (22). Each strap member (40) 

defines opposite first and second end regions (50,51), and 
each end region includes two different fasteners (56,58). 

For example, the different fasteners may be hook fasteners 
(56) and buttons (58). The garment shell (22) defines 

opposite first and second waist sections (33,34). A 
plurality of loop patches (42) are attached to the garment 

shell (22). Each loop patch (42) is desirably formed of a 
loop material that is adapted to releasably engage a hook 

fastener (56) and include a button hole (44) to receive a 
button (58). The wearer can select between either of the two 

different fasteners (56,58) to attach the strap members (40) 
to the garment shell (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of 
garments with attachment systems and attachment systems for 
same. The present invention is intended for use with a wide variety 
of garments that are to be worn in the crotch region. Such 
garments may include disposable absorbent articles, 
underwear, bathing suits, athletic supporters, prosthetics, 
or other personal care or health care garments. With 
particular reference to disposable absorbent articles, these 
articles include such things as incontinence garments, 
disposable diapers, briefs, training pants, or the like. Garments of this type have generally included an attachment 
system for securing the garment in the crotch region of the 
wearer. Such attachment systems have routinely included a 
particular type of mechanical or adhesive fastener. Garment 
manufacturers have had to select a fastener that has the 
broadest appeal to its customers. The individualized needs of consumers, on the other hand, 
give rise to a demand for more than one type of fastener. 
These needs may be based on factors such as impaired 
dexterity, design familiarity, discreetness under clothing, 
security of closure, or the like. Nonetheless, manufacturers 
have heretofore been unable to accommodate these varying 
fastener needs of consumers. In view of the above needs the invention provides an 
attachment system as per independent claim 1, and a garment 
as per independent claim 2, 11, 17 or 18. The invention 
further provides a method for making a garment as per 
independent claim 26 and a method for using the garment as 
per independent claim 27. Further advantageous features,  
 
aspects and details of the invention are evident from the 
dependent claims, the description and the drawings. The 
claims are intended to be understood as a first non-limiting 
approach of defining the invention in general terms. The invention especially provides a garment with selectable 
fastners. More particularly, the invention pertains to an 
improved absorbent garment that enables the wearer to select 
from more than one type of fastener for maintaining the 
garment in place. In response to the above discussed inability of garment 
manufacturers to accommodate differing fastener preferences, 
a new attachment strap and garment have been developed. 
According to an aspect of the invention an attachment strap 
includes a strap member defining a first end region, an 
opposite second end region, and a central region 
therebetween. Each strap member includes a first fastener 
and
