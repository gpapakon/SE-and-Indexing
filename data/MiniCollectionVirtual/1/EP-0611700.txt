<ABSTRACT>
A container for a liquid. In order to reduce a volume 
of the container (10) for a liquid after use thereof, a bellows 

portion (16) is provided at an axial direction portion of a 
container main body. A lid member is removed (30), and liquid 

within the container for a liquid is discharged from an 
opening portion. The bellows portion is contracted so that 

head space can be adjusted and so that a volume of the 
container main body can be reduced. Further, because the 

head space can be adjusted, an interior of the container for 
a liquid is always substantially filled with the liquid so 

that oxidation of the liquid can be prevented. When the 
liquid is poured, the bellows portion automatically expands 

and contracts so that the liquid flows quickly and so that 
little air is drawn in. Further, if a certain amount or 

more of the liquid in the interior is discharged, the volume 
can be reduced, and a volume-reduced state can be maintained 

by tightly screwing the lid member. When the bellows 
portion is expanded, the container for a liquid is easy to 

hold as there are convex and concave portions at the bellows 
portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container for a
liquid, and more specifically, to a container for a liquid
which is suitable for use as a container for a processing
solution which is used in developing processing of a
photosensitive material.Photosensitive material processing apparatuses such as
automatic developing apparatuses have used rigid containers
for liquids which are formed by blow molding or injection
blow molding and by using a single-layer material such as
high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinylchloride resin
(PVC) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a multi-layer
material such as nylon/polyethylene (NY/PE). These
materials are used as they are suitable for the self-supportability
of the container (i.e., the ability of the
container to stand alone without external support) and
because they are suitable for the filling of the container
with liquid at a factory and for the pouring of the liquid
into a processing tank, thereby facilitating use of the
container. Further, these materials are used because they
guarantee the strength required by UN regulations 
(regulations for the transport of exported dangerous
substances, i.e., legal regulations considering the drop
strength at -18Â°C) as well as regulations for poisonous
substances.However, even when the contents of such a conventional,
rigid container for a liquid have been discharged and the
container is empty, the container retains its configuration
due to the rigidity thereof. Therefore, it is difficult for
a user to crush the container after the container has been
used and is to be discarded. A drawback arises in that the
used containers occupy a relatively large amount of space.Recently, blow-molded containers have been developed in
which a bellows portion is provided at a trunk portion of
the container so that the container can be collapsed by
being pressed. In accordance with such collapsible, blow-molded
containers, the collapsed state can be maintained by
tightly closing a cap when the container is collapsed.
Therefore, the collection efficiency improves when the
containers are collected with the caps fastened thereto.However, with such conventional blow-molded containers,
there is a drawback in that it is easy for the container to
return to its original configuration when the cap is removed
therefrom.In recent years, as more consideration has been given
to using limited natural resources more efficiently, blow-molded 
containers have been reused as material for resin
manufactured products. When used containers are collected
