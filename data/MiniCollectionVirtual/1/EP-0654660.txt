A process for recognising the viscosity variation
of a medium (6) stirred by means of a magnetic

stirrer (1) in a vessel (5), wherein a stirring
magnet (7) in the medium (6) is set in rotation by

means of a magnet (3) disposed underneath the
vessel (5) and rotated with the help of a drive

motor (2), which is magnetically coupled with the
stirring magnet, and wherein the rotational speed

of the drive motor is kept constant by a controller
and the variation in the output of the controller

(8) is measured by the load variation,
characterised in that an actual viscosity of the

medium (6) is selected as a reference value and a
controller output variation, measured by means of a

software-operated digital controller (8) in the
event of a load alteration in the further course of

the operation, is displayed as a measurement of the
alteration in viscosity.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that disturbances in the form of viscosity

alterations can be controlled by means of the
software-operated digital controller (8) and at the

same time the controller output variation is
measured and displayed, using suitable software, as

a measurement of the alteration in viscosity.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that strongly-fluctuating relative controller

output variables are measured and evaluated as a
signal to indicate that the bond between the driven

magnets (3) and the stirring magnets (7) has been
broken. 
An apparatus to implement the process according to
one of claims 1 to 3 with a magnetic stirrer (1),

where a stirring magnet (7) can be rotated in a
vessel (5) for a medium (6) with the help of

magnets (3) driven in a rotational direction by a
drive motor (2) and the magnetic stirrer has a

controller (8) to regulate the speed of the drive
motor (2), and an evaluation apparatus (9) is

connected between the controller (8) and the drive
motor (2) to measure the output alteration of the

controller (8), characterised in that a software-operated
digital controller (8) is provided, and

that a key is provided for measuring the viscosity
existing at one point in time as a reference value

and a display is provided of the controller output
variable measured during the load alteration as a

measurement of the alteration in viscosity.
An apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in
that a filter is assigned to the evaluation

apparatus (9) which eliminates or suppresses short-term
fluctuations in the controller outputs.
