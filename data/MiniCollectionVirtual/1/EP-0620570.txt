<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superconducting 
fault current limiter, more particularly to a fault current 
limiter utilizing the superconductivity of a ceramic high-temperature 
superconductor the superconducting state of 
which is switched to a resistive state when a 
fault current beyond a critical value is applied. In recent years, there has been proposed an inductive 
current limiter for protection of a circuit breaker or a 
transformer in power networks from fault currents caused by 
a short-circuit or thunderbolt. When a fault 
current occurs, the inductive current limiter provides a high 
impedance which limits the fault current to restrain an 
electric load acting on the circuit breaker and transformer 
below a threshold level. In US-A-5,140,290, 
there is disclosed a high power inductive 
current limiter of this kind which is composed of an 
induction coil with at least one winding through which 
current flows, a cylindrical body made of a ceramic high-temperature  
 
superconducting material concentrically arranged 
within the induction coil, and a core made of a soft 
magnetic material of high permeability concentrically 
disposed within the cylindrical body. In normal operation, 
the superconductivity of the cylindrical body shields the 
magnetic field of the induction coil completely from the 
core (Meissner effect), and impedance of the induction coil 
is maintained at a very low level to minimize loss of the 
electric power. When a fault current flows through the 
induction coil due to a short-circuit or thunderbolt, the 
superconductivity of the cylindrical body disappears and 
the impedance of the induction coil reaches its maximum, 
current-limiting value. FR-A-2 666 912 discloses a 
similar device. To maintain the superconductivity of the cylindrical 
body in normal operation , the inductive current limiter is 
immersed in cooling liquid such as liquid nitrogen. In the 
conventional inductive current limiter, however, the cylindrical 
superconductive body is surrounded by the induction 
coil and is in contact with the cooling liquid only at its 
inner peripheral surface. For this reason, the cooling 
efficiency of the superconductive body becomes insufficient, 
particularly in the case that the superconductive 
body is large in thickness. Furthermore, the superconductive 
body is greatly affected by eddy current losses 
in the iron core and joule losses caused by the resistance 
of the induction coil since it is disposed between the iron 
core and the inductive coil, resulting
