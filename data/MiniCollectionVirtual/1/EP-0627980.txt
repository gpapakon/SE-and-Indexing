<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a worm extruder in the cylinder (1) of which, containing at least one worm (3), there are drillings to take pins (7) projecting into the conveying region and arranged in radial planes, the axes of which are tangential to the cylinder wall or parallel thereto in the neighbourhood of the tangents. The aim of the invention is to provide a worm extruder with high plasticisation efficiency which can be produced simply and economically, and has the advantage of substantially improved self-cleaning properties and complete protection against pin breakage. According to the invention, the pins are arranged in regions in which the core of the worm is fitted with a collar (5) and the inner wall of the cylinder with an annular recess (6), the pins are arranged outside an (imaginary) cylinder surrounding the backs of the worm web and the pins obliquely transfix the radial plane region in which the core collar and the annular recess are located.

<CLAIMS>
Worm extruder, wherein the cylinder (1) receiving at
least one worm (3) is provided with holes to receive

pins (7) disposed in radial planes projecting into the
conveying zone, the axes of said pins being arranged

tangentially to the cylinder wall or in the vicinity of
the tangents parallel thereto, characterised in that the pins (7)

are arranged in regions in which the worn (3) is
provided with a ring-shaped core ridge (5) and the

cylinder (1) is provided with a ring-shaped recess (6)
in the inside wall; that the pins (7) are arranged

outside an (imaginary) cylinder enclosing the backs of
the webs (4) of the worn (3); that the pins (7) pass

obliquely through the radial plane region in which the
core ridge (5) and the ring-shaped recess (6) are

located.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the ring-shaped recess (6) in the inside wall of

the cylinder is trapezoidal in cross-section.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the angle of the pin axes with the radial plane

region amounts to 30° to 75°.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the pins (7) have a recess (10) with a radius

larger than the radius of the worn (3).
Worm extruder according to Claim 4, characterised in
that the pins (7) are adjustable and may be fixed about

their axis by an angle amounting up to 90°.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the core ridge (5) on the worn (3) is trapezoidal 

in cross-section.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the pins (7) have a round cross-section.
Worn extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the pins (7) are hollow and have tempering medium

flowing through them.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the spacing of the pins (7) from one another in the

radial plane region corresponds approximately to the pin
diameter or less.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the core ridge (5) of the worn is provided with a

toothed arrangement.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the depth of the toothed arrangement decreases in

the direction of conveying.
Worm extruder according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the pins (7) are arranged in the cylinder (1) in

several radial plane regions arranged one behind the
other viewed in the direction of flow.
