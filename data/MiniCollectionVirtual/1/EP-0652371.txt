<ABSTRACT>
A self-rotation blocking mechanism in a scroll 
compressor having a movable scroll member and fixed 

scroll member fixed to a casing. The mechanism is 
constructed of circumferentially spaced opposing pairs of 

pins 9 and 10, which are connected to an end plate 12 of 
the movable scroll member 2
 and a faced end wall of the 
casing 4, respectively, and which are in a side-by-side 

contacting relationship. The circumferential arrangement 
of the pins is such that, at every angular position of 

the movable scroll member, there exists at least one pair 
of the pins which generates a force in a direction 

opposite to a self-rotating torque applied to the movable 
scroll member caused by the compression reaction force. 

A locally concentrated arrangement of the pairs of the 
pins for generating such a force can be employed at the 

angular position which produces a larger value of self-rotating 
torque. Furthermore, the diameters of the pins 

are such that one half of the sum of the diameters is 
equal to or smaller than the radius of the orbital 

movement of the movable scroll member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scroll 
compressor capable of, for example, used as a refrigerant 
compressor for an air conditioning system for an 
automobile. In particular, the present invention relates 
to a device for blocking a self-rotating movement of a 
movable scroll member in a scroll compressor. A scroll compressor is known, which includes a 
casing, a drive shaft rotatably supported by the casing, 
a fixed scroll member fixed with respect to the casing 
and a movable scroll member which is movable with respect 
to the casing and which is arranged eccentric with 
respect to an axis of the drive shaft and driven by the 
drive shaft, the fixed and movable scroll members being 
in a side-by-side relationship to create closed chambers, 
means for blocking the rotational movement of the movable 
scroll member about its own axis, while allowing an 
orbital movement of the movable scroll member about the 
axis of the drive shaft, the closed chambers being 
displaced radially inwardly while their volume is reduced 
during the orbital movement of the movable scroll member, 
an intake means for introducing a medium to be compressed 
into the chamber when the chamber is radially outwardly 
located, and an outlet means for discharging the medium 
as compressed from the chamber when the chamber is 
radially inwardly located. The self rotation blocking 
means comprises a plurality of angularly spaced circular 
recesses formed on the end surface of the movable scroll 
member facing the casing, a plurality of angularly spaced 
circular recess on the end surface of the casing facing 
the end surface of the scroll member and arranged axially 
opposite the recess on the scroll member, so that  
 
equiangularly spaced pairs of the recess on the movable 
scroll member and the casing are created, and a plurality 
of spherical members supported between the axially 
opposite recess in the respective pairs. This self 
rotation blocking mechanism is defective in that the 
construction is itself complicated, thereby increasing 
the number of the parts. Furthermore, the provision-of 
the circular recess necessarily increases the area of the 
end surfaces of the casing and the movable scroll 
members, thereby increasing the size as well as the 
weight of the related parts. The said mechanism does not 
allow the size and a weight of a compressor to be 
reduced, on one hand, or for the manufacturing cost to be 
reduced, on the other hand. A scroll compressor has been proposed wherein, 
in place of the self rotation
