<ABSTRACT>
Packaging for use in transportation and handling of 
a surgical instrument including a safety device (40) which 

prevents engagement of the instrument or movement of a 
safety mechanism from a safety position. In a preferred 

embodiment the safety device is a safety interposer shaped 
to fit around the shaft (22) of a trocar. The safety 

interposer acts as a physical barrier between the trocar 
and cannula of the trocar assembly and prevents the two 

parts (12,14) from coupling which may occur from jostling during 
transportation or handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging for use in 
transportation, handling and storage of surgical 
instruments including a means to prevent engagement of the 
surgical instrument by preventing movement of a 
safety means from a 
safety position where upon engagement or movement of the 
instrument, sharp edges or points of the instrument could 
be exposed. It is important for surgical instruments to be 
packaged in a readily presentable sterile condition. If 
the instrument is engaged, particularly if the instrument 
has sharp edges exposable when engaged, it may disturb the 
packaging containing the instrument so as to compromise 
its sterile environment. For example, if a tip of a 
trocar or an insufflation needle is exposed, it may 
puncture the packaging. Flexible packaging is particularly vulnerable to such 
puncturing or disturbance. Flexible packaging is defined 
herein as a packaging which does not rigidly conform to 
the contents of the package. Examples of such packaging 
are surgical drapes and closed cell foam which may be 
formed from materials such as, for example, cellulose or 
plastics. The use of flexible packaging has become 
increasingly desirable as opposed to thermoformed blister 
packaging or styrofoam type packaging which have recently 
become less desirable for reasons relating to economics,  
 
ease of packaging disposal in the operating room, 
processing considerations and environmental concerns. It is therefore desirable in the sterile packaging of 
surgical instruments, especially flexible packaging, to 
prevent unintended engagement of the device or movement of 
a safety mechanism from its safety position, which could 
expose a sharp instrument. A trocar assembly for use in endoscopic surgical 
procedures generally comprises two major components, an 
obturator and a cannula. The obturator is initially 
positioned within the cannula and has a puncturing or 
penetrating tip which typically extends from the cannula. 
The obturator tip is used to penetrate the skin and 
underlying tissue to provide cannula access to a body 
cavity. The obturator may then be removed and 
laparoscopic or arthroscopic surgery performed through the 
cannula. An example of such a device is described in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,535,773. Typically, in transportation and storage as well as 
in use, the obturator is positioned in the cannula and the 
puncturing or penetrating tip of the obturator extends 
from the distal end of the cannula. However, many 
trocars have safety shields which cover the tip of the 
ob

<CLAIMS>
A combination comprising: 

a surgical instrument (12) having a shaft (26); and 
a safety interposer (40) having a slot which at least 
partially receives said shaft (26) of said surgical 

instrument (12),
 
   characterised in that the interposer (40) is positioned 

on said shaft (26) such that the interposer acts as a 
physical barrier to prevent movement of a safety mechanism 

(30) of the surgical instrument (12) from a safety position. 
The combination of claim 1, wherein: 

the surgical instrument (12) is a trocar assembly 
comprising an obturator (22) having said shaft (26) and a 

sharp tip (23); 
said safety mechanism (30) is comprised of a safety 
shield (25) having a safety position in which the safety 

shield is locked into a position in which the safety shield 
covers the obturator tip (23); and 
said safety interposer slot is adapted to at least 
partially receive the shaft (26) of the obturator. 
The combination of claim 1, wherein the surgical 
instrument is an insufflation needle (100). 
The combination of claim 3, wherein: 

said safety mechanism is an inner needle (104), said 
inner needle having a blunt tip (105) and being disposed 

within an outer needle (101) having a sharp tip (112); and 
said safety position is where the tip (105) of the inner 
needle (104) extends beyond the sharp tip (112) of the outer 

needle (101). 
The combination of claim 4, wherein: 

said inner needle (104) comprises a notch (120); and 
said slot of said interposer (140) is shaped to fit in 
the notch (120) to prevent said tip (105) of said inner  

 
needle (104) from retracting within the outer needle (101) 

to expose the sharp tip (112). 
The combination of claim 1, wherein: 

the surgical instrument (12) is a trocar assembly 
including: 


a cannula (14) having a proximal end and a distal end, 
the proximal end being coupled to a cannula handle (15) 

having a proximal end (16); 
an obturator (22) having a proximal end coupled to an 
obturator handle (24) having a distal end (28), a shaft 

(26) and a distal end comprising a puncturing tip (23) which 
is extendable through said cannula (14) and beyond the 

distal end of said cannula; 
a safety shield (25) capable of covering the puncturing 
tip (23) of said obturator (22), said safety shield being 

coupled to the obturator handle (24) and being axially 
movable with respect to said obturator to expose the 

puncturing tip (23) when said obturator is engaged; and 
engagement means (27) which operates to engage said 
trocar assembly when the cannula handle (15) and the 

obturator handle (24) are coupled for use;
 
   wherein said interposer (40) prevents engagement of said 

trocar assembly by physically intercepting said engagement 
means (27). 
The combination of any preceding claim, further 
comprising a flexible sterile outer wrap. 
The combination of any preceding claim wherein said 
safety interposer (40) is provided with an end portion (44) 

having a grasping surface adapted for easy removal of the 
interposer from the instrument (12).
