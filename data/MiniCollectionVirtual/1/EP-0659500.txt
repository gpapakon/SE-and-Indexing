<ABSTRACT>
A method of bending a pipe having an 
oblong cross-section for heat exchangers comprises 

the stages of causing a relative rotation which is 
substantially equal to 180° between two limbs (2a, 

2b) of the pipe (2) about an axis (8) parallel to 
the longer axis (4) of the cross-section of the 

pipe so as to obtain two straight limbs (2a, 2b) 
connected to one another by a curved connecting 

portion (2c) and to cause a relative rotation 
which is substantially equal to 90° between each of 

the straight limbs (2a, 2b) and the connecting 
portion (2c).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
of bending a pipe having an oblong cross-section
for heat exchangers.In heat exchangers of the mechanical
expansion type (in which the stack of fins is
secured to the pipes by a pipe expanding or
mechanical expansion process), the use of pipes
bent in a U-shape (so-called forked pipes) enables
a collector plate and a tank for recirculating the
refrigerating fluid to be dispensed with,
evidently saving material and increasing the
reliability of the heat exchanger since, with the
same number of pipes, the fluidtight points
present as a whole are reduced by half.The use of forked pipes is common today
for aluminium or copper pipes with a circular
section, whilst, for pipes having a flat or oblong
section, it is difficult and, in fact,
impracticable, when the flat pipe has to be bent
in a U-shape and the two limbs of the fork
maintained aligned along the longer axis of their
cross-section. The object of the present invention is to
provide a method of bending a pipe having an
oblong cross-section in a U-shaped arrangement
which permits the two limbs of the pipe to be
placed in a position in which the longer axes of
the respective cross-sections are aligned with or
parallel to one another without causing excessive
stretching of the material in the bending zone.According to the present invention, this
object is achieved by a method comprising the following steps:
causing a relative rotation substantially equal
to 180° between two limbs of the pipe about an axis
parallel to the longer axis of the cross-section
of the pipe, so as to obtain two straight limbs
with longer axes of the respective cross-sections
parallel to one another and connected to one
another by a curved connecting portion; andcausing a relative rotation between each of the
straight limbs and the connecting portion about an
axis coinciding with or parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the straight limbs.The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing
a heat exchanger comprising a stack of fins fixed to
a plurality of pipes having an oblong cross-section,
in which each pipe has two straight limbs 
and a curved connecting portion,
the longer
axes of the respective cross-sections of the two
straight limbs of each pipe being aligned with or
parallel to one another, and the
connecting portion having an oblong cross-section
with a longer axis at a right-angle to the longer
axes of the cross-sections of the straight limbs, characterised in that
the pipes are bent by the method according to the

A method of bending a pipe having an
oblong cross-section for heat exchangers,

comprising the steps of:

causing a relative rotation substantially equal
to 180° between two limbs (2a, 2b) of the pipe (2)

about an axis (8) parallel to the longer axis (4)
of the cross-section of the pipe, so as to obtain

two straight limbs with longer axes (4) of the
respective cross-sections parallel to one another

and connected to one another by a curved
connecting portion (2c); and
causing a relative rotation between each of the
above straight limbs (2a, 2b) and the connecting

portion (2c) about an axis coinciding with or
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the straight

limbs.
A method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the relative rotation

between each of the straight limbs (2a, 2b) and
the connecting portion is substantially equal to

90°.
A method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the pipe (2) is bent by 

inserting a reinforcing core (6, 6') in the pipe
(2) beforehand.
A method according to Claim 3,
characterised in that the reinforcing core is a

flexible element (6, 6') which can slide freely in
the pipe (2).
A method according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the reinforcing core (6, 6')

is produced by a material which melts at a
temperature which is substantially lower than the

melting temperature of the material constituting
the pipes, the material being introduced into the

pipe (2) in the liquid state and being made to
solidify before the bending method is performed,

the molten material then being removed from the
pipe (2) in the liquid state by heating the pipe

(2).
Method of manufacturing a heat exchanger comprising a stack of
fins secured to a plurality of pipes (2) having an

oblong cross-section, in which each pipe (2) has
two straight limbs (2a, 2b) and a curved

connecting portion (2c), the
longer axes of the respective cross-sections of

the two straight limbs (2a, 2b) of each pipe (2)
being aligned with or parallel to one another, and 

the connecting portion (2c) having an oblong
cross-section with a longer axis at a right-angle

to the longer axes of the cross-sections of the
straight limbs (2a, 2b) characterised in that the pipes are bent

by the method according to claims 1 to 5.
