<DESCRIPTION>
 STABILIZED GELLED-PASTE FORMULATIONS OF SULFONYLUREAS AND AN INJECTION SYSTEM FOR THEIR APPLICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention comprises "gelled-paste" compositions of sulfonylurea herbicides in an aqueous chemically stabilized formulation which requires vigorous mixing to disperse into aqueous media. This invention also comprises an improved method of direct injection to crops of such highly viscous crop protection products, and a new and improved apparatus for the direct injection of said products.Sulfonylurea herbicides and chemically stabilized aqueous compositions thereof are known in the literature. For instance, U.S. 4,936,900 teaches chemically stabilized aqueous sulfonylurea or agriculturally suitable sulfonylurea salt dispersions in salt mediums which retain their effectiveness as herbicides when formulated as aqueous suspensions consisting of a sulfonylurea or its agriculturally suitable salt with a salt of a carboxylic or an inorganic acid, or with mixtures of such carboxylic or inorganic acid salts. The present invention teaches the gellation of sulfonylureas in salt mediums thereby preserving the stability of the typically unstable sulfonylurea.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention teaches aqueous, chemically stabilized, gelled-paste compositions of sulfonylurea herbicides. These herbicidal compositions are prepared from a suspension of the type described by U.S. 4,936,900 by the addition of a water-soluble or water- swellable synthetic, semisynthetic or biological polymer(s) which retains its gel characteristics in 

 salt mediums and which does not adversely affect the chemical stability of the sulfonylurea or agriculturally suitable salt of the suspension.One embodiment of the present invention is a process for making a sulfonylurea herbicide gelled- paste composition, comprising combining a sulfonylurea herbicide and one or a mixture of agriculturally suitable salts of a carboxylic or inorganic acid in an aqueous medium to form a stable dispersion of the resultant sulfonylurea salt in the aqueous medium, then blending one or more gelling agents into said dispersion in sufficient amount to form a gelled-paste composition, which gelling agent is inert with respect to said herbicide. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises an aqueous herbicidal gelled-paste sulfonylurea composition comprising, in admixture, in weight percent based on total formulation weight:(a) 1-60% of one or a mixture of sulfonylurea herbicide active ingredien (s) ,(b) 1-40% of one
