<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for writing data to files from a computer system to a Write Once Read Many (WORM) Disc medium which results in a creation of an ISO 9660 standard disc is disclosed. The method and apparatus each efficiently manages writes to WORM medium in the creation of a file structure that conforms to ISO standard 9660 which governs management of CD-ROM disc files. The method and apparatus are efficient both in terms of the time required to perform such writes and in the amount of medium consumed as overhead. In addition, the invention provides a method and apparatus for writing to WORM disc in which there is a high degree of confidence that the information written is indelible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
performing data transfer between a computer operating system 
and a peripheral device in the form of files and the 
management of such files. In particular the method and 
apparatus apply to writing such files on a Write Once Read 
Many (WORM) Medium to create an industry standard formatted 
disc which has a high degree of indelibility. Two common forms of storage device on a computer system are 
the magnetic disc drive and the magnetic tape drive. Computer 
systems have established methods of handling each of these two 
types of storage peripherals. Media created on such devices 
for a given standard are portable to other systems which 
employ devices which adhere to the same standard. Recently another type of storage peripheral has become 
available on many systems; the compact disc device. It is 
common for such devices to be read-only in nature. A computer 
system cannot write information to media on such devices but 
can only read information from media on the device. Compact 
discs provide the advantage of a high volume of storage in a 
relatively small package which is highly portable. In 
addition, the use of such discs permits access to the 
information in a rapid manner. An industry standard for file management on CD-ROM disc has 
been promulgated by the International Standards Organization 
under the designation ISO 9660. This standard has been  
 
adopted by much of the industry and there are numerous systems 
which read CD-ROMs which adhere to the ISO 9660 standard. There is a storage device which permits a degree of output 
capability for optical media. The device is known as a Write 
Once Read Many (WORM) disc drive and it provides the 
capability to perform a write to an optical medium. Once 
written, the medium is not erasable. There is no information management system standard for 
writable optical discs. If such discs are managed in the same 
manner as a magnetic disc file, such as that used on hard disc 
or floppy disc, there are a number of drawbacks for a WORM 
device. Specifically, such methods tend to be extremely slow 
and to waste much of the available medium. The methods are slow because the file management scheme 
requires that file allocation tables and directories be 
maintained on the medium with the data. Each update to the 
file causes updates to the directories, tables, and the data 
area. This is not a problem with magnetic medium since it is 
erasable and does not result in a loss of storage capacity.

<CLAIMS>
A system for reading and writing data on a storage 
medium in response to requests from a requester, said 

system comprising: 

a write-once, read-many disc drive for storing data 
files and associated disc drive management information on 

said disc drive, said disc drive management information 
including a disc drive entry for each file; 
reading and writing means for said disc drive; 
storage means external to said disc drive for storing 
I/O management informat
ion having a predetermined standard 
file management format, said I/O management information 

including information corresponding to said disc drive 
entries; 
I/O management means coupled to said storage means and 
to said reading and writing means; 
said I/O management means being operative in response 
to write requests from said requester for using said I/O 

management information in said external storage means for 
writing files on said disc drive in accordance with said 

standard format; 
said I/O management means being operative when all 
files to be written to said disc drive are completed for 

writing a disc file management directory on said disc drive 
in accordance with said standard format so as to permit use 

of said disc drive for ready-only purpose with any other 
device which supports said standard format. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said disc drive is an 
optical disc, and wherein said standard file management 

format is ISO 9660. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said disc management 
information and said I/O management information are updated 

by said I/O management means each time a file is written on 
said disc drive.  

 
System of claim 1, wherein the updating of said I/O 
management information is performed based on said disc 

drive entries. 
The system of claim 4, wherein said disc drive file 
management directory written on said disc drive when the 

writing of all files on said disc drive is completed is 
derived from said I/O management information. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said data files and 
said disc drive entries are written on said disc drive in 

respective prescribed areas, and wherein files are written 
so that the written files grow linearly toward the area 

containing said disc drive management information. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said I/O management 
means provides for verifying whether an area on said disc 

drive is appropriate for writing a data file. 
The system of claim 4, wherein said I/O management 
means provides for checking the consistency of said I/O 

management information and said disc drive management 
information, and for displaying an error indication when an 

inconsistency is found. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said I/O management 
means provides a protected mode of writing a file such 

that, if an interruption occurs during writing, the portion 
written on the disc drive is retained and the disc drive 

management information updated accordingly.
