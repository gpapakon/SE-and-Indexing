<ABSTRACT>
In order, in a web roll (4) of printing material, to design the start of the web advantageously with simple geometry and with a high degree of safety against undesirable detachment, a perforation (43) is provided at a distance from the new web roll (4) of printing material on the front-side web edge (42) of the web (41). Furthermore, the web (41) has adhesives (18, 19) on the near side and the far side of the perforation (43), a first adhesive being arranged as a holding adhesive (18) between the perforation (43) and the web edge (42) of the web (41) on the underside of the latter which faces the second web layer, and the second adhesive being arranged as a connecting adhesive (19) in the direction of the web (41) to be glued on, on the top side of the start of the web (41).

Process for preparing a printing material web roll 
(4) for flying roll exchange, in which a front web edge 

(42) extending over the width of the web (41) is cut at 
the beginning of the web, a perforation (43, 43a) is 

provided at a distance from the front web edge (42), 
parallel to it and extending over the width of the web 

(41), behind the perforation a splicing adhesive (19) 

is provided on the outer side of the beginning of the 
roll, and in front of the perforation a holding 

adhesive (18) is provided which holds the beginning of 
the roll on the printing material web roll (4), so that 

the perforation (43, 43a) allows the new web (41) to be 
torn away after adhesion. 
Splicing point arrangement for a new printing 
materal web roll (4) for the automatic splicing of a 

web (41) by adhesive onto an expiring roll (3), and 
having a perforation (43, 43a) provided at a distance 

from the front edge (42) of the web (41) of the new 
printing material web roll (4), the printing material 

web roll (4) having adhesive (18, 19) on both sides of 
the perforation (43, 43a), the first adhesive as a 

holding adhesive (18) between the perforation (43, 43a) 
and the edge (42) of the web (41) between the latter 

and the second web layer, and the second adhesive as a 
splicing adhesive (19) in the direction of the web (41) 

to be spliced on the upper side of the beginning of the 
web (41), in particular for a rotary printing machine, 

characterised in that the edge (42) extends over the 
width of the web (41). 
Splicing point arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the adhesive (18, 19) is an  

 
adhesive that can be brushed on or sprayed on, or an 

adhesive strip. 
Splicing point arrangement according to claim 2 
or 3, characterised in that the edge (42) of the web 

(41) extends at 90° to the winding direction of the 
web (41). 
Splicing point arrangement according to claim 2 
or 3, characterised in that the edge (42) of the web 

(41) is arranged at an angle of less than 90° to the 
winding direction of the web (41). 
Splicing point arrangement according to one of 
claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the perforation 

(43, 43a) comprises two dashed perforation lines spaced 
apart from each other, whose successive perforation 

cuts overlap in the cutting direction, follow on from 
each other, or are spaced apart.
