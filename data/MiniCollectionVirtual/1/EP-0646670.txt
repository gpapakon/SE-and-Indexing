<ABSTRACT>
A device for controlling machines having a pressure pick-up area populated with at least one pressure or force sensor (10, 11) and a signal evaluation device (12) for the conversion of the sensor signal or signals into control signals (24), which are a function only of the pressure exerted but not of the movement of any device parts, for the machine drive (21).

<CLAIMS>
Device for the control of machines, in particular sewing
machines, comprising at least one pressure or load sensor (10,

11) and a signal evaluation unit (12) for conversion of the
sensor signal(s) into control signals (24) for the machine drive

(21), 
characterised in that
 the control signals (24) depend
solely on a pressure exerted onto a pressure pickup surface

which is directly linked to the at least one pressure or load
sensor at which time the pressure pickup surface will not move

relative to other parts of the device.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
sensitivity of the at least one pressure or load sensor (10, 11) is

adjustable.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2 with at least two pressure or
load sensors (10, 11), where the signal evaluation unit (12)

comprises a locking device (17) which on response of a sensor
(10, 11) interrupts the signal paths (15, 16) of at least a part of

the other sensors (10, 11).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

the signal evaluation unit (12) comprises an analog/digital
converter for generating digital control signals (24) for the

machine drive (21).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that

the signal evaluation unit (12) comprises an encoding unit (20)
for producing encoded control signals (24) for the machine drive

(21).
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the
encoding unit (20) is designed as an EPROM to facilitate simple

matching of the device to machine drives (21) which require
differently encoded control signals (24). 
Device according to Claim 1 for the control of a sewing
machine, 
characterised by
 a pressure pickup surface fitted
with two pressure or load sensors (10, 11), and the first sensor

(10) affects the raising of the sewing foot and the thread cutter,
and the second sensor (11) affects the torque preselector of the

sewing machine drive.
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the two
sensors (10, 11) are configured alongside each other on a

support plate, and the device is operated either by two-foot
operation or by single-foot operation after rotation of the upper

plate by 90Â°.
