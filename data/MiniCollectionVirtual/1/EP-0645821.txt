<ABSTRACT>
A low-noise NPN transistor comprising a cut-off 
region (38) laterally surrounding, at a given distance, 

the emitter region (36) in the surface portion of the 
transistor and of such conductivity as to practically 

turn off the surface portion of the transistor, so that 
the transistor operates mainly in the bulk portion. The 

cut-off region is formed by a P ring (38) astride a P⁻ 
type well region (35) and the epitaxial layer (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low-noise
bipolar transistor.As is known, in electronic devices, the term
"noise" indicates a random fluctuation in currents or
voltages at the device terminals, and may seriously
limit the minimum signal level that can be handled by
the device.The noise in each device is due to various
physical causes, some of which have been known for some
time. Of particular interest are what are known as
"flicker" noise (also indicated 1/f) and "burst" noise,
the first of which exists in all and the second in a
significant percentage of devices.Flicker noise is commonly acknowledged to be
caused by fluctuations in the number of carriers, due to
entrapment of the carriers in surface layers of the
device, i.e. to tunneling at the semiconductor-oxide
interface. According to accepted theory, the carriers in
the semiconductor may communicate with trap levels at a
given distance within the tunnel oxide layer, and remain 
trapped for some time prior to being re-emitted. In the
case of transistors, in particular, flicker noise
sources are located at the base-emitter junction.Flicker noise is especially undesirable in the
case of operational amplifier input transistors and
audio preamplifiers.Burst noise, on the other hand, is caused by a
sharp variation in current between two or more constant
values. Variation frequency may be very low (less than 1
Hz) or high (hundreds of Hz), in which case, burst noise
may be confused with a high degree of flicker noise.
This type of noise is generally attributed to the
presence of defects, metal inclusions and precipitates
in the space charge region of the junction; and the
fluctuation in current depends on the extent, if any, to
which the defect participates in conduction. The fact
that burst noise is reduced by deficiency-reducing
processes, such as gettering, would appear to bear out
this theory.In the case of flicker noise, the noise power at
the output terminals of a transistor is proportional to
IBα, where IB is the base current and α a constant
ranging between 1 and 2. In the case of burst noise, the
output noise power is inversely proportional to the
square of the gain of the transistor, so that, for a
given collector current, high-gain transistors are less
affected by flicker and burst noise as compared with
low-gain types. One proposal already made for reducing flicker and
burst noise is to produce extremely high-gain
(super-beta SBT) transistors with a gain typically
ranging between 1000 and 10,000 for collector currents
below 1 µA. In NPN
