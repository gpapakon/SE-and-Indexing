<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new heterocyclic compounds
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.More particularly, it relates to new heterocyclic
compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof
which have activities as bradykinin antagonists, to
processes for preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising the same, and to the use of
the same for the preparation of medicaments useful in the prevention and/or the
treatment of bradykinin or its analogues mediated diseases
such as allergy, inflammation, autoimmune disease, shock,
pain, or the like, in human being or animals.One object of this invention is to provide new and
useful heterocyclic compounds and pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof which possess activities as
bradykinin antagonists.Another object of this invention is to provide
processes for the preparation of said compounds and salts
thereof.A further object of this invention is to provide a 
pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active
ingredient, said heterocyclic compounds and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Still further object of this invention is to provide
a therapeutical method for the prevention and/or the
treatment of bradykinin or its analogues mediated diseases
such as allergy, inflammation, autoimmune disease, shock,
pain, or the like, using said heterocyclic compounds and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Some heterocyclic compounds have been known as
described, for example, in EP-A-224,086, EP-A-261,539,
Chemical Abstracts 90:34849g (1979), or Chemical Abstracts
97:18948c (1982). However, it is not known that said
compounds have activities as bradykinin antagonists.The object heterocyclic compounds of this invention
are new and can be represented by the following general
formula [I] :

wherein
X1 is N or C-R6,X2 is N or C-R7,X3 is N or C-R8,R1 is hydrogen or halogen,R2 is halogen,R3 is hydrogen, nitro, amino, 
a group of the formula

in which
R10 is hydrogen or (C1-C6)alkyl, andR11 is glycyl or glycyl substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting
of (C1-C6)alkyl, alkanoyl, halo(C 1-C6)alkanoyl, phenyl(C1-C6)alkanoyl, naphthyl-(C1-C6)alkanoyl,
benzoyl, naphthoyl, pyridylpiperazinyl(C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C3-C6)alkenoyl,
tolyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl, phenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxyphenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl,
(C1-C6)alkylenedioxy-phenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl, nitrophenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl,
cyano-phenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl, halo-phenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl,
hydroxy-phenyl(C3-C6(alkenoyl, hydroxy(C1-C6)alkoxy-phenyl(C3-C6)alkenoyl,
