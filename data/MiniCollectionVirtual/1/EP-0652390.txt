<ABSTRACT>
An automatic tensioner characterized in that a swinging lever (30) having a pulley (10) mounted at the leading 
end thereof is rotatably supported by a fixed case (20), and that the swinging motion of the swinging arm (30) is 

damped by virtue of the action of a helical torsion spring (40) and a friction member (60). A coned disc spring (70) 
is disposed not at the proximal end portion of a hub (31) for the swinging arm (30) where the friction member (60) 

is disposed but at the leading end portion of the hub (31). Interposed between a plate (80) constituting the fixed side 
and the swinging arm (30) constituting the rotating side is the friction member (60) which comes into direct contact 

with the plate (80) and the swinging arm (30). This prevents the generation of rattling noise attributed to play. Even 
microvibrations can be damped by positively 
generating swinging resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
tensioner, and more specifically to an automatic tensioner for 
maintaining constant the tension of a belt or the like mounted 
on a pulley. Generally, an automatic tensioner is arranged such 
that a swing arm pivotally supported relative to a fixed case 
is given rotational spring loads in a predetermined direction 
by a helical torsion coil spring and swing resistance by a 
friction member interposed between the swing arm and the fixed 
case. The known automatic tensioner shown in Fig. 26 has a 
bush member 102, corrugated a sheet spring 103, a bush member 
104 and a friction member 105 pressingly held between a swing 
arm 100 and a fixed side member 101. The bush member 102 is 
restrained from rotating relative to the swing arm 100 by a 
boss 102a. By inserting a pin 104a into the boss 102a of the 
bush member 102, the bush member 104 is restrained from 
rotating relative to the bush member 102 while permitting 
expansion and contraction of the corrugated sheet spring 103 
interposed between the bush members 102, 104. The friction 
member 105 is fixed to the bush member 104 by means of dowel 
joint, and is pushed toward the fixed side member 101 by  
 
spring loads of the corrugated sheet spring 103. Thus, the 
friction member 105 is fixed to the swing arm 100 by a pair of 
the bush members 102, 104 as being restrained from rotating, 
and is brought into sliding contact with the fixed side member 
101 as pushed by the corrugated sheet spring 103. However, in the automatic tensioner in which the 
friction member 105 is indirectly fixed to the swing arm 100 
by a pair of the bush members 104, 102, backlash due to the 
fitting precision of the pin 104a and the boss 102a disposed 
between the bush members 104, 102 is apt to cause rattle 
during pivoted motion. The rattle would cause noises during 
the pivoted motion. In the case of microvibration, the 
microvibration is absorbed by the rattle, thus failing to 
produce swing resistance. Consequently, it becomes impossible 
to damp the microvibration. In view of the above problems, the present invention 
is proposed with the object of providing an automatic 
tensioner capable of preventing noises or defective damping of 
microvibration. For achieving the above object, a preferred aspect 
of the present invention provides an automatic tensioner 
including: an automatic tensioner including: a fixed member; 
a swing member whose base end is supported by said fixed 
member rotatably around an axis of rotation of
