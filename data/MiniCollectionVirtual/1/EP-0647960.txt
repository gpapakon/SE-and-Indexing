<ABSTRACT>
An imaging symmetrical energy filter (of the Î©-type) comprising two pairs 
of sector magnets (1), (2), (3), (4) for an electron microscope. The second-order 

chromatic aberration is corrected by arranging the two pairs of sector magnets {(1),(4) 
and (2),(3)} further apart. This enables suitable arrangement of the coils to generate 

correction hexapole fields, so that the chromatic error is even completely eliminated. 
Moreover, correction of the third-order aperture aberration is also possible by 

constructing the hexapole coil (9) in the symmetry plane also as an octupole coil. 
Further correction of this third-order aberration is achieved by applying an octupole 

field (5) directly at the entrance of the first sector magnet (1) and an octupole field (13) 
directly at the exit of the fourth sector magnet (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a particle-optical instrument, comprising a particle 
source for producing electrically charged particles which move along an optical axis of 
the instrument, an energy filter with an optical axis, an initial portion and an end 
portion of which coincide with the optical axis of the instrument, which energy filter 
comprises successively a first, a second, a third and a fourth sector magnet, the distance measured 
along the optical axis of the energy filter between the first and the second sector magnet being equal to the corresponding distance between the 
third and the fourth sector magnet, the optical axis being mainly circular with a radius 
of curvature R0 within said sector magnets, and also comprising a first correction 
magnet for generating a hexapole field between the first and the second sector magnet, 
and a second correction magnet for generating a hexapole field between the third and 
the fourth sector magnet. An energy filter for use in a particle-optical apparatus as described above 
is known from a publication in "Optik", Vol. 73, No. 2 (1986), pp. 56-68, entitled 
"Test and improved design of a corrected imaging magnetic energy filter", by S. Lanio 
and H. Rose. The cited article, notably section 3.2, describes an energy filter in which 
a number of second-order image aberrations are corrected by means of magnetic 
hexapole fields. In a particle-optical apparatus such as a transmission electron microscope, 
particles (electrons) can be inelastically scattered by a specimen to be examined. 
Generally speaking, these electrons do not contribute to image contrast, but cause noise 
or a reduction of contrast in the specimen image formed by the microscope. Elimination 
of such electrons from the image-forming electron beam will result in improved image 
quality. This can be realised by means of an energy filter in which a selection slit is 
arranged in an energy-dispersive location on the optical axis in order to select a given 
energy window. In some cases it is also important that the local composition of a 
specimen can be determined. To this end, use can be made of an imaging spectrometer 
whereby the energy distribution in the imaging electron beam can be measured; the 
energy spectrum thus measured provides information regarding the structure of the 
specimen point considered and also regarding its chemical composition. Furthermore, it  
 
is sometimes desirable to select a given band from the energy spectrum in order to form 
an image exclusively by means of
