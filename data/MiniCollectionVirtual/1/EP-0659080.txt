<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cosmetical
method for hair loss, and more
particularly, to a method using
tretinoin and hydrocortisone.Restoration of human hair has been attempted for
centuries. In many cases, hair loss is merely covered
by wigs or toupees. Many medical treatments have been
attempted over the years; however, up until now, no
treatment has been found which satisfactorily
stimulates hair growth for a wide variety of cases,
including alopecia.Each hair extends from a tube-like depression
called a hair follicle. The hair follicle extends
from the surface of the skin into the dermis and may
pass into the subcutaneous layer. At the base of the
follicle is a group of epidermal cells which receive
nourishment from blood vessels that occur in a
projection of connective tissue at the base of the
follicle.As the epidermal cells divide and grow, older
cells are pushed toward the surface. The cells that
move upward and away from the nutrient supply become
keratinized and die. Thus, hair is dead keratin, just
like scale, and is formed at a predetermined rate.The normal rate of growth of hair is 1 cm per
month. Each hair follicle goes through a cycle of a
growth stage (anagen hair), and an involution or
resting stage (telogen hair). The anagen stage lasts
about three years, while the telogen stage lasts only
about three months. Once the hair follicle reaches
the telogen stage, the hair falls out. Eventually,
the hair follicle regenerates into the anagen stage
and new hair is produced. The cycle of hair activity for hair follicles is
independent for each hair follicle. However, when the
hair follicles fail to regenerate hair, baldness
results.Many causes of hair loss are known. Exposure to
chemotherapy, XRT, and exposure to toxic chemicals can
cause anagen hair loss. Hormonal imbalances, stress,
nutritional deficiency, and usage of many drugs can
cause telogen effluvium. Alopecia areata and
androgenetic alopecia are caused by genetics.It is known that the hair follicle is an immune-privileged
organ, and it has been postulated that hair
growth may be regulated by the immune system (Frusgate
et al, JournalofInvestigativeDermatology, 97: 417-420,
1991). Thus, in order to restore hair, it is
necessary to treat any underlying causes of the hair
loss, such as disease, stress, hormonal imbalance, or
nutritional deficiency. It is known, as disclosed in
Olson, Alopecia Evaluation, PrimaryCare 1989: 16 (3),
p. 765-787, to treat hair loss by making an evaluation
of the patient, including patient history,
