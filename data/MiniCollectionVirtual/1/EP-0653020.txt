<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an in-line device for an induction intake 
system of a machine to attenuate standing waves created in the system by 
the operation of the machine. The device is useful in attenuating intake 
noise rumble in an induction intake system of a reciprocating internal 
combustion engine or compressor. The induction intake system of a machine like a reciprocating 
internal combustion engine or compressor communicates the working 
chamber space of the machine to a source of working fluid such as air. As 
the machine operates, it creates a partial vacuum that draws fluid through 
the system and into the machine. The induction intake system acts like a 
two-way street so that as fluid is being conveyed toward the machine, 
noise created by the machine's operation is transmitted in the opposite 
direction. This noise is often deemed sufficiently objectionable that it is 
required to be attenuated. For that purpose it is known to insert passive 
noise attenuation devices into the intake system, and examples of such 
devices are found in commonly assigned patents of the same inventor, US 
4,934,343 and US 4,936,413. From FR-A-2 376 291 it is known to provide a device for in-line 
insertion into a fluid-carrying induction intake system to attenuate noise in 
such system comprising a walled chamber enclosing a chamber space, a 
tubular inlet and a tubular outlet via which the chamber can be connected 
into such a system, a venturi section that is disposed on the chamber and 
serves to convey fluid from the inlet into the chamber space wherein the 
venturi section terminates in a discharge opening that is disposed within 
the chamber space to discharge into the chamber space fluid that has 
entered the device through the inlet. The present invention relates to a new and unique device which can 
be inserted in-line into an induction intake system of a machine, such as 
those mentioned, for attenuating standing wave noise that the machine  
 
transmits through the intake system. Like the devices of the referenced 
patents, the device of the present invention is entirely passive and imposes 
no significant restriction on the fluid flow through the intake system to the 
machine. Further features, advantages, and benefits of the invention will 
become apparent from the following detailed description, the appended 
claims, and the accompanying drawings which disclose a presently  
 
preferred embodiment of the invention according to the best mode 
contemplated at the present time in carrying out the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (20) for in-line insertion into a fluid-carrying induction 
intake system (12) to attenuate noise in such system comprising a walled 

chamber (24) enclosing a chamber space (26), a tubular inlet (28) and a 
tubular outlet (30) via which the chamber can be connected into such a 

system, a venturi section (34) that is disposed on said chamber and serves 
to convey fluid from said inlet into said chamber space wherein said venturi 

section terminates in a discharge opening (48) that is disposed within said 
chamber space to discharge into said space fluid that has entered said 

device through said inlet, said device attenuating 
standing wave noise in such system without imposing unacceptable 

restriction to fluid flow through the system characterized in that said device comprises a baffle section 
(42) that is disposed on said chamber and serves to direct fluid from said 

chamber space to said outlet, and said baffle section comprises a surface 
(49) which is concave in transverse cross section, which confronts said 

discharge opening, and which extends from its confrontation with said 
discharge opening lengthwise along an arc to said outlet to direct fluid 

toward said outlet. 
A device as set forth in claim 1 characterized further in that said 
inlet is disposed in an axial end wall portion of the wall of said chamber and 

said outlet is disposed in a sidewall portion of the wall of said chamber. 
A device as set forth in claim 1 characterized further in that said 
inlet comprises a circular transverse cross section, said outlet comprises a 

circular transverse cross section, and the axis of said outlet is disposed at 
an approximate right angle to the axis of said inlet. 
A device as set forth in claim 2 characterized further in that 
said inlet comprises a circular transverse cross section, said outlet 

comprises a circular transverse cross section, and the axis of said outlet is 
disposed at an approximate right angle to the axis of said inlet.  

 
A device as set forth in claim 1 characterized further in that said 
surface axially overlaps a portion of said venturi section that is immediately 

contiguous said discharge opening. 
A device as set forth in claim 5 characterized further in that said 
discharge opening is circular and said surface as viewed in transverse 

cross section has an arcuate extent slightly less than that of a semi-circle 
as measured about said discharge opening. 
A device as set forth in claim 1 characterized further in that said 
baffle section further includes an integral tubular section which fits closely 

within and has a snap-on attachment with a tubular-walled opening (44) 
extending through the wall of said chamber for disposing said baffle 

section on said chamber, said tubular section forming said outlet. 
A device as set forth in claim 1 characterized further in that said 
venturi section includes an integral tubular section which fits closely within 

and has a snap-on attachment with a tubular-walled opening (36) 
extending through the wall of said chamber for disposing said venturi 

section on said chamber, said tubular section forming said inlet.
