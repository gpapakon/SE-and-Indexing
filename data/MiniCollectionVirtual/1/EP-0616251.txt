<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic emulsion containing silver 
halide grains comprising {111} and {100} faces and having a 

silver iodide content of less than 2 mol%, wherein silver 
halide grains having 5 or more dislocations per grain account 

for not less than 50% of the total number of silver halide 
grains, the dislocations being located substantially on the 

{100} face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic emulsion, a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material incorporating said emulsion, and a method 
of processing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material, more specifically a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material of excellent anti-pressure properties 
and improved developability. In recent years, there have been increasingly strict 
demands for silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
materials as to photographic performance stability, as well as 
high sensitivity and high image quality. For example, there 
is a need for improved resistance against pressure to which  
 
the silver halide photographic light-sensitive material being 
handled in picture taking, processing or other photographic 
operation, is exposed in various manners, whether accidentally 
or inevitably, from the viewpoint of photographic performance 
stabilization. Accordingly, various technical improvements 
have been proposed, mainly for silver halide photographic 
emulsions. Meantime, quick processing at high temperatures has 
rapidly gained popularity for the processing of silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive materials; processing time has 
shortened in automatic processing of various silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive materials using automatic 
processing machines. For the purpose of rapid processing, it 
is necessary to offer sufficient sensitivity and gradation in 
short time. Examples of traditional means of improving the anti-pressure 
properties of silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
materials include those described in US Patent 
No. 2,628,167 and Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public 
Inspection (hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. 
Publication) Nos. 116025/1975 and 107129/1976, in which an 
iridium salt or thallium salt is added at the time of silver 
halide grain formation. However, these methods have a 
drawback of sensitivity reduction. Also, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 220238/1988 
and 201649/1989 disclose improvements of the granularity,  
 
anti-pressure properties and exposure luminance dependence of 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive materials, while 
maintaining high sensitivity, by introducing dislocation to 
silver halide grains. However, these prior art methods are subject to 
limitation as to the simultaneous improvement of anti-pressure 
properties and developability, so that they are unsatisfactory 
to meet the recent requirements of stable
