<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing non-agglomerated
water insoluble inorganic particles having a dense, amorphous silica
coating by using a dispersion aid.US Patent 2,885,366 describes several methods for applying a dense silica
coating to substrate particles, i.e. core particles, by suspending the particles in water
and then coating with active silica while maintaining the pH in the range of 7 to 11. If
the substrate particles in the suspension are in some degree aggregated together to
form clumps or agglomerates, these are coated with a layer of dense, amorphous silica
as well as any primary substrate particles. Such a product embraces a wide
distribution of sizes of silica coated substrates. Although the coated agglomerates can
be broken down into smaller fragments, by milling or sonification, the fragmented
agglomerates have exposed surfaces which are not coated with silica. This detracts
from the performance of these materials in many applications, e.g. rough surface
appearance in films such as paints.US Re. 27,818 describes this problem for silica coated titanium dioxide
pigments. The solution offered in that reference was treating a suspension of silica
coated titanium dioxide with an aqueous solution of a water soluble aluminum
compound. Paints made using this pigment gave smoother films.The use of dispersion aids for initially preparing non-agglomerated aqueous
suspensions of particulate substrates is known in the art. There is no previous
mention, however, of using suitable dispersion aids in the silica coating process to
minimize particle agglomeration and give a more uniform particulate product which
has been accomplished by the present invention. The products produced by the
present improved process have shown particle size improvement and superior
performance such as decreased surface roughness when used as pigments in film
formers, e.g. paints. GB-A-2042574 describes a process for preparing inorganic pigment
compositions. A pigment slurry is mixed with an alkali silicate and the silicate and a
reactant is then added to form a silica sol in the slurry. A dense, amorphous coating is
not formed on the pigment particles. This reference refers to the use of surfactant for
use in dispersing metal powder pigments.WO 89/09801 describes a process for coating TiO2 particles with a dense,
amorphous silica coating. A water soluble dispersing aid may be added to the pigment
slurry prior to deposition of the silica coating. The dispersing aids disclosed in this
reference
