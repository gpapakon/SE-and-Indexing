<ABSTRACT>
Water heating apparatus includes a heat store in the 
form of a tank (12) for containing a volume of water, 

heaters for heating the water in the tank, and a heat 
exchanger located in an upper portion of the tank having a 

cold water inlet (28) and a hot water outlet (30) for 
feeding a hot water supply (32). The heat exchanger (26) 

and the heaters (16, 14) are arranged to encourage 
convection currents around the heat exchanger (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in apparatus
and methods for water heating and space heating. In
particular, but not exclusively, the invention relates to
an improved water and space heating system in which
electric elements are used as a primary heat source.One of the most popular forms of space heating for
domestic and commercial applications is wet heating
systems in which hot water is circulated from a boiler
through radiators and the like located throughout the
space to be heated. At present, the majority of these
systems are gas, oil or solid fuel fired. The heated
water from the boiler also provides the heat source for
the hot water supply, the heated water being carried from
the boiler and passed through a coil located within a hot
water heating and storage tank.In many situations it is not possible or is
inconvenient to utilise a gas, oil or solid fuel fired
boiler and in these situations electricity may be used to
provide space and water heating. Electrical space heating
may be provided using radiant element heaters, though
these are generally considered to be expensive to run.
Many homes are provided with "storage heaters" which draw
low tariff power, usually during the night and early
morning, to heat material which then gives off heat during
the day. Such heaters suffer from the disadvantage that
they are less controllable than other systems and cannot
be used to produce instantaneous heat in, for example, a
rarely used room where the heater has not had the
opportunity to warm up during the previous low tariff
period. Also, electric storage heaters tend to be heavy
and bulky. Electric water heating typically takes the
form of one or more electrical heating elements located in 
a water tank. Again, heating water using such elements is
considered to be relatively expensive when compared with
other fuels.It is one object of the present invention to provide
an improved water and space heating system, of the type
described in GB-A-2 253 268, which is suited for heating
using an intermittent supply of energy, such as low tariff
electricity, to provide a steady supply of heat for
heating water and for space heating.In one embodiment of the present invention a water
heating and space heating system includes a heat store in
the form of a tank containing a relatively large volume of
water, electrical heating elements for heating the water
in the tank, a wet space heating system including a
plurality of radiators in fluid communication with the
tank through tank outlet and return ports, and a

Water heating apparatus including:

a heat store in the form of a tank (12) for containing a volume of water;
heating means (14, 16) for heating the water in the tank (12); and
a heat exchanger (26) located in an upper portion of the tank having a cold water
inlet (28) and a hot water outlet (30) for feeding a hot water supply (32);
the apparatus forming part of a space heating system including at least one heat
radiating means (18) in fluid communication with the tank (12) through tank outlet

and return ports (20,24) and in which the return port (24) is arranged to direct
water into a region between the outer surface of the heat exchanger (26) and the

inner surface of the tank (12) to form a cold water area around the periphery of

the heat exchanger (26);
the heat exchanger (26) and the heating means (16) thus being arranged to
encourage convection currents to flow upwardly through a central portion of the

heat exchanger (26) and downwardly between an outer surface of the heat
exchanger (26) and an inner surface of the tank (12).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the heat exchanger
cold water inlet (28) is arranged to direct incoming cold

water onto the outer surface of the heat exchanger (26).
The apparatus of claims 1 or 2 in which the heating
means includes a first heating element (14) located in the

lower portion of the tank (12) and a second heating element
(16) located in an upper portion of the tank.
The apparatus of claim 3 in which the second heating
element (16) provides a major proportion of the heating

effect. 
The apparatus of any one of preceding claims in which
the heat exchanger (26) defines one or more passages (63)

therethrough for accommodating upwardly directed convection
currents (71) and including a large diameter central

passage.
The apparatus of claim 4 or claim 5 in which the
second heating element (16) is located directly below the

heat exchanger (26) for providing a hot water plume which
passes upwards through the one or more passages (63) in the

heat exchanger (26). 
A method of heating a store of water for use in heating, the method comprising
the steps:


providing a volume of water contained in a tank (12) to form a heat store;
providing a heat exchanger (26) in an upper portion of the tank (12) having a cold
water inlet (28) and a hot water outlet (30) for feeding a hot water supply (32);
the apparatus forming part of a space heating system including at least one heat
radiating means (18) in fluid communication with the tank (12) through tank outlet

and return ports (20,24) and in which the return port (24) is arranged to direct
water into a region between the outer surface of the heat exchanger (26) and the

inner surface of the tank (12) to form a cold water area around the periphery of
the heat exchanger (26); and
heating the water in the tank in such a manner to heat at least said upper portion
and to encourage the creation of convection currents to flow upwardly through a

central portion of the heat exchanger (26) and downwardly between an outer
surface of the heat exchanger (26) and an inner surface of the tank (12) to provide

for effective heat transfer to the heat exchanger (26) and to provide a hot water
supply.
The method of claim 7 in which the water in the tank
is heated at two separate locations, one in a lower portion

of the tank and the other in an upper portion of the tank,
the water being heated in such a manner that the upper

portion of the tank is heated at a different rate than the
lower portion of the tank.
The method of claim 8 wherein the water in the upper
portion of the tank is heated at a faster rate than the

lower portion of the tank.
