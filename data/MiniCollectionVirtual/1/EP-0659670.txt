<ABSTRACT>
In a flying tuck folding device for a rotary printing press, the object consists in cutting signatures on solid cylinders and folding them transversely at a high production speed and with a good quality. According to the invention, this is carried out by the interaction of a five-zone collecting-cutting cylinder (2), having controlled puncture sets (10-14) and cutting devices (4-8), with a solid four-zone folding, puncture and counter-cutting strip cylinder (16) which has controlled puncture sets (17-20), counter-cutting strips (22-25) and rotating folding blades (27-30).

<CLAIMS>
Flying tuck folding apparatus for a web-fed
rotary printing machine for collection and double production,

having a folding drum (16) and a cutting cylinder
(2) as well as folding rolllers (36, 37), characterized

in that a five-section collection and cutting cylinder
(2) that has controlled pin sets (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) and

cutting devices (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) cooperates with a solid,
four-section folding, pin and counter-cutting-bar

cylinder (16) that has controlled pin sets (17,18,19,20),
counter-cutting bars (22, 23, 24, 25) and rotating

folding blades (27, 28, 29, 30), in that a device for
changing the sheet spacing between folding blades (27,

28, 29, 30) and the pin sets (17, 18, 19, 20)
respectively assigned to the said blades is provided on

the folding, pin and countercutting-bar cylinder (16).
Flying tuck folding apparatus according to Patent
Claim 1, in which the five-section collecting and cutting

cylinder (2) is replaced by a seven-section collecting
and cutting cylinder, and the four-section folding, pin

and counter-cutting-bar cylinder (16) is replaced by a
six-section folding, pin and counter-cutting-bar

cylinder.
Flying tuck folding apparatus according to Patent
Claims 1 or 2 [sic]
, characterized in that, upstream of
an entry wedge area of a paper web train (42), in the

area lying between the collecting and cutting cylinder
(2) and the folding, pin and counter-cutting-bar cylinder

(16), there is arranged a roller (98) that is mounted
fixedly on the side frame.
Flying tuck folding apparatus according to Patent
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that, on the periphery of

the folding-pin and counter-cutting-bar cylinder (16),
downstream of the second folding roller (37) as viewed in

the production direction, there is arranged a brush
roller (78), whose distance from the folding, pin and

counter-cutting-bar cylinder (16) is adjustable and which
is driven in the opposite direction of rotation and at an

increased peripheral speed. 
Flying tuck folding apparatus according to Patent
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the folding, pin and

counter-cutting-bar cylinder (16) has a folding-blade
carrier (21) and a counter-cutting bar and pin carrier

(26), in that folding-blade carrier (21) and counter-cutting
bar/pin carrier (26) are arranged to be mutually

adjustable in the peripheral direction.
