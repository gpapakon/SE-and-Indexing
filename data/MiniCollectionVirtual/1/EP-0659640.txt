A state detector and loop compensation parameter controller (10) is devised for 
use with an active hand controller system having a single hand controller (30) or having 

first and second hand controllers (30, 40), processing and control means (44b', 48', 52', 
56') for the hand controllers and a flight control computer (60). The state detector and 

loop compensation parameter controller (10) accepts a plurality of inputs and provides a 
plurality of adjustment signals to the processing and control means to improve the 

performance of the active hand controller system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to an active hand controller system according to the preamble
of the independent claim 1.This invention relates generally to a control system of the type wherein manual
control devices such as a control stick are provided which have an electro simulated
variable rate feel. Hand controller systems having this electro simulated variable rate
feel are commonly referred to as active hand controllers and may e.g. taken from EP-A-0
483 773,
which discloses a system of the above-mentioned type.
They utilize electric motors to produce desired hand controller force and
position response. These systems require sensors which can provide accurate and stable
information about the position of the hand grip and the force or torque exerted upon the
hand grip by the operator. The present invention relates specifically to servo motor
response in an active hand controller. In the past, servo motor response in a active hand
controller has been adversely affected by requirements for large peak motor forces and
stable operation with a large null detent, i.e., a large nonlinearity in the force vs.
displacement characteristic of the control stick. Control system designers must select
several control loop parameters such as integrator time constant, loop gain, proportional
gain, damping and motor controller force gain when designing a system. The selection
of control loop parameters is made more difficult because the parameters interact and
affect one another. In addition, the loop parameters must provide satisfactory operation
over a wide range of operating environments. In the past, the parameter selection
process typically proceeds by selecting a motor controller force gain to meet the system
peak force requirement when the integrator output is near its maximum output. Then
by using simulation techniques, analysis, and lab tests the remaining control loop
parameters are iteratively selected to achieve the best system response and stability.Aircraft control systems operate over a wide range of conditions and system
performance could be enhanced by modifying the control loop parameters for different
conditions. For example when only small system force is required a small motor 
controller gain could be used and the remaining parameters could be adjusted for fast
response. Conversely when peak motor force is required the motor controller gain could
be increased and the remaining parameters could be adjusted for stability. Thus a need
exists for a particular servo control system for an aircraft control
