<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for location dependent verbal command 
execution in a computer based control system within an 

installation having multiple physical locations. A specified 
function within each physical location, such as a lighting 

fixture or alarm setting, may be controlled by a selected 
verbal command. A microphone within each room or physical 

location within the installation is utilized to detect each 
utterance of a verbal command and the volume of each verbal 

command is determined for each physical location at which 
that command is detected. Thereafter, the physical location 

having the highest volume for a detected verbal command is 
identified and the specified function is controlled at only 

that location. In the event multiple speakers simultaneously 
utter an identical verbal command at different physical 

locations, the location of maximum volume is determined for 
each speaker and the specified function is controlled at only 

the maximum volume location associated with each speaker. In 
this manner, a single verbal command may be utilized to 

control an identical function at multiple locations within an 
installation in a location dependent manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an improved
computer based control system and in particular to an
improved computer based control system which may be operated
utilizing verbal commands. Still more particularly, the
present invention relates to a method and system for location
dependent verbal command execution in a computer based
control system.Computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the modern
world. The introduction of the so-called "personal" computer
has greatly enhanced the availability of computing power to
the ordinary consumer. As these computers become more
commonplace a greater number of applications for this
computing power is available to the consumer.For example, in addition to word processing, mathematical
calculation and computer aided drafting or manufacturing
applications personal computers are increasingly utilized to
control various functions in the modern household. In an
effort to make such devices increasingly "user friendly" the
interface between the user and the computer has been rapidly
developing in many areas.One technique for decreasing the complexity of the interface
between a user and a computer is the utilization of interface
techniques which are intuitive and easily understood by those
who are not skilled in the computer arts. Intuitive
interfaces, such as a graphical user interface or a verbal
command interface are becoming increasingly common. For
example, speech recognition software now exists which makes 
it possible for a computer system to be "trained" to recognize selected
words or phrases. One example of this technology is presently available
within cellular telephones installed within automobiles. A user may,
utilizing verbal commands, automatically dial a particular location or
specified number without requiring manual input of that data to the
cellular telephone system, greatly enhancing system efficiency and user
safety while driving an automobile.In a similar application, the utilization of a computer for the creation of
a so-called "smart house" has also been proposed in conjunction with a
verbal command interface; however, the number of locations and functions to
be controlled utilizing a computer in such an application is somewhat
greater than the functions typically present within a telephone system or
other simple application. A computer based control system implemented
within a "smart house" will allow appliances and electrical systems, such
as lighting or alarm systems to be operated by voice control.Known voice control systems

<CLAIMS>
A method for location dependent utilization of verbal commands uttered
by users in a computer based control system for controlling at least a

specified function at each of a plurality of physical locations within
an installation, said method comprising the steps of:


detecting (102) a verbal command at each of a plurality of physical
locations within said installation;
determining a volume of said verbal command at each of said plurality
of physical locations within said installation;
identifying (110) a selected physical location within said
installation having a highest volume for said detected verbal

command; and
controlling (112) said specified function at only said selected
physical location.
The method according to Claim 1, further including the step of
comparing (108) each verbal command detected at each of a plurality of

physical locations within said installation to determine a number of
users uttering said verbal command substantially simultaneously.
The method according to Claim 2, wherein said step of identifying a
selected physical location within said installation having a highest

volume for said detected verbal command comprises the step of
identifying (116) a selected physical location within said

installation having a highest volume for each detected verbal command
uttered by each of said number of users.
The method according to Claim 3, further including the step of
controlling (118) said specified function at only said 

selected physical location within said installation having a highest
volume for each detected verbal command uttered by each of said number

of users.
A computer based control system (70) for location dependent
utilization of verbal commands uttered by users and for controlling at

least a specified function at each of a plurality of physical
locations within an installation, said computer based control system

comprising:

means for detecting ( 76) a verbal command at each of a plurality of
physical locations within said installation;
means for determining (78) a volume of said verbal command at each of
said plurality of physical locations within said installation;
means for identifying (78) a selected physical location within said
installation having a highest volume for said detected verbal command;

and
means for controlling (80) said specified function at only said
selected physical location.
The system according to Claim 5, further including means for comparing
each verbal command detected at each of a plurality of physical

locations within said installation to determine a number of users
uttering said verbal command substantially simultaneously.
The system according to Claim 6, wherein said means for identifying a

selected physical location within said installation having a highest
volume for said detected verbal command comprises means for

identifying a selected physical location within said installation
having a highest volume for each detected verbal command uttered by

each of said number of users. 
The system according to Claim 7, further including means for
controlling said specified function at only said selected physical

location within said installation having a highest volume for each
detected verbal command uttered by each of said number of users.
The system according to Claim 5, wherein said means for detecting a
verbal command at each of a plurality of physical locations within

said installation comprises a microphone (32,48) disposed within each
of said plurality of physical locations within said installation.
The system according to Claim 9, further including an
analog-to-digital converter (72) coupled to each microphone disposed

within each of said plurality of physical locations within said
installation.
