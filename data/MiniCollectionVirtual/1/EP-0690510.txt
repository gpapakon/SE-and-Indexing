<ABSTRACT>
A SOI (Silicon On Insulator) logic circuit including 
serially connected power switching SOI MOSFETs (44, 45) and 

a logic circuit (43) constituted by SOI MOSFETs. The bodies 
of the MOSFETs of the logic circuit are made floating state, 

thereby implementing low threshold voltage MOSFETs. The 
bodies of the power switching MOSFETs are biased to power 

supply potentials, thereby implementing high threshold 
MOSFETs. The low threshold voltage MOSFETs enable the logic 

circuit to operate at a high speed in an active mode, and 
the high threshold voltage power switching MOSFETs can 

reduce the power dissipation in a sleep mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low voltage SOI
(Silicon On Insulator) logic circuit using a SOI field
effect transistor operable by 1V dry battery.As a conventional low voltage logic circuit, one such
as shown in Fig. 1 is known. The logic circuit employs a
bulk CMOS circuit and is disclosed in Japanese patent
application laying open No. 6-29834 (1994), and S. Mutoh, et
al. "1V HIGH SPEED DIGITAL CIRCUIT TECHNOLOGY WITH 0.5 µm
MULTI-THRESHOLD CMOS", IEEE, 1993, pages 186-189.This circuit has a basic arrangement, in which a CMOS
logic circuit group 3 is connected between a power switching
MOSFET 4 and a power switching MOSFET 5 which are connected
to a high potential power supply line 1 and a low potential
power supply line 2, respectively. Here, the power
switching MOSFETs 4 and 5 are MOSFETs with high threshold
voltage, and the logic circuit group 3 is composed of low
threshold voltage MOSFETs.The high threshold voltage power switching MOSFETs 4
and 5 are provided with a sleep signal SL and its inverted
signal *SL at the gates thereof, respectively. The MOSFETs
4 and 5 are kept nonconducting by a high level signal SL in
a sleep mode (during a waiting time period) of the logic
circuit group 3, thereby stopping power supply to the logic
circuit group 3. Reversely, the power is supplied to the
logic circuit group 3 in an active mode by keeping the sleep 
signal SL low, thereby maintaining the MOSFETs 4 and 5 in a
conducting state.Generally, although low threshold voltage MOSFETs have
characteristics of high speed operation, their leakage
current in a nonconducting state is large. In contrast,
although high threshold voltage MOSFETs have characteristics
of low speed operation, their leakage current in a
nonconducting state is small. Therefore, the circuit as
shown in Fig. 1 can operate at a high speed in the active
mode of the logic circuit group 3 while maintaining a small
leakage current in the sleep mode.It shoud be noted here that individual substrates of
MOSFETs of the logic circuit group 3 are connected to the
high potential power supply line 1 or the low potential
power supply line 2 in the conventional low voltage logic
circuit. This substrate bias is applied for preventing
faulty operations due to latch up which will readily occur
in bulk CMOS. Incidentally, although the substrates of
MOSFETs of the logic circuit group of Fig. 1 of the above-mentioned
paper of Mutoh, et al. are shown as though they
were not connected to any points, this is for the simplicity
of drawing, and the substrates of
