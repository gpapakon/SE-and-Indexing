<ABSTRACT>
The number of signal lines of a cable between a controller and a carriage is small, and the printing timing of each head is adjustable in
units each smaller than one pixel. The signal lines include a signal line for serial printing data including printing data arranged in a

predetermined order for printing heads, a signal line for a clock corresponding to each bit of the data, a signal line for a signal HDSL [1..0]
representing that the printing data included in the serial printing data corresponds to which printing head, and signal lines for the signals for

driving the heads. Before transferring data, one slice section corresponding to the time slot for transferring the unit printing data for each
head is divided into sections, and further the sections are divided into subsections the number of which is equal to the number of print heads.

The transfer of printing data is started from arbitrary subsection independently for each head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing apparatus such
as a printer or a plotter, and more particularly to the
optimization of a method for transferring data to a print head
having a shift register installed therein.Normally, a printing apparatus, such as an ink jet printer
or plotter, repeats printing and paper sheet feeding to complete
an image while moving the print head across the paper sheet.To send print data to the print head carried on the
carriage, the data is sent from a central processor (engine
controller), which controls the printing apparatus, to the print
head via a cable.With the introduction of a full-color, high-speed printing
apparatus, more heads are installed in the apparatus, usually
four and, in some cases, six. This requires more signal lines
between the central processor and the carriage, increasing both
the apparatus size and the cost.In addition, because of the use of a flexible flat cable,
more signal lines not only increase the cost but make the
radiation noise problem more serious. Therefore, there is a
need for minimizing the number of signal lines.FIGS. 17 and 18 show examples of a conventional method for 
connection between the engine controller and the carriage. In
the conventional method shown in FIG. 17, the largest number of
signal lines is used because all data for each head are
transferred independently to each print head.On the other hand, in a conventional method shown in FIG.
18, head data (HDDATA) and drive signals (HDDRIVE) are sent
independently to each head while a data transfer clock (HDCLK)
and a latch clock (HDLTCLK) are shared by the heads. This
configuration uses less signal lines than the configuration
shown in FIG. 17. However, as shown in the timing chart in FIG.
19, 128 bits of data are continuously sent to one head and 128
bits of data are latched at the same time in the configuration
shown in FIG. 18. In this configuration, data is transferred to
each head, one slice at a time and, therefore, fine print timing
adjustment cannot be made. (In this specification, a "slice"
represents a group of pixels of the number of one-horizontal-pixel
by vertical print nozzles (128 pixels in this case), as
one unit. A slice corresponds to a time slot required to
transfer a unit of print data corresponding to a plurality of
print nozzles on a plurality of heads). Thus, when printing
data in color, color mixture adjustment is made by one dot.
Because human eye can normally identify a color difference of up
to 1/4 pixel, it is known that adjustment of 1/4 pixel
