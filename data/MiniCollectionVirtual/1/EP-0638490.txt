<CLAIMS>
A waste and valuable substance separation unit (10) having a 
plurality of interconnected waste containers (11) which are provided with 

identification means (12) for the purposes of association with a given 
valuable substance or residual substance fraction, wherein the waste and 

valuable substance separation unit (10) is of a modular-like configuration 
with interchangeable waste containers (11) arranged on a central post (13),
 
   characterised in that
 
   the identification means (12) are interchangeable fitment rings (16) 

which can be put on to the waste containers (11) and of which one end (17) 
is crimped over around the upper edge of the respective waste container (11) 

and which extend over a region of the outside surface of the waste container 
(11).
