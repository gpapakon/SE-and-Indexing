<ABSTRACT>
A threaded connection with an element (9) having an internal thread (5) and a screw element (1) which can be screwed into the element (9) has a seal (2) in a ring, sleeve or cup form running at least over part of the axial extent of the threaded area. Here, at least one section of the outside of the screw element (1) located in the area of the seal (2) in the position of use, preferably its threaded end piece (4), has a cross-section or diameter increasing in the screw-in direction, so that the front area (6) in the screw-in direction according to arrow (Pf1) has a larger cross-section or diameter than the area (7) following during the screwing-in. The area lying between the areas (6 and 7), during turning in the opposite direction to the screw-in movement, brings about an axial adjustment relative to the seal (2) and thus presses it radially on account of the roughly conical configuration, so that a turning-back movement does not impair the sealing action but even improves it.
