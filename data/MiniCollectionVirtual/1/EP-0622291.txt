<ABSTRACT>
An articulated joint for pivotally connecting adjacent 
sections of a vehicle. The joint includes a first slewing 

ring (37) and a second slewing ring (39) and each slewing ring (37,39) 
has an 

outer member (41) connected to an inner member (43). A bearing race 
is located between the outer member (41) and the inner member (43) to 

permit relative rotation of the members (41,43). The outer member (41) 
of each slewing ring (37,39) is constructed for connection to one 

section of a vehicle and the inner member (43) of each slewing 
ring (37,39) is constructed for connection to another section of the 

vehicle. Location sleeves (53,58) are located radially inwardly of 
the inner members (43) of the slewing rings (37,39) and a shim (71) 

is located between the ends of the location sleeves (53,58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to an articulated 
joint for connecting two sections of a vehicle, and in 
particular to an articulated joint for use in connecting 
sections of a vehicle which must negotiate short radius 
turns. An articulated joint according to the invention may 
be used as a vertical pivot joint in a mine shuttlecar 
having a plurality of pivotally connected sections. Articulated joints for use in vehicles are known in 
the art. Most vehicles also include horizontal pivot joints 
which permit the vehicle to operate on undulating surfaces. 
In vehicles with vertical pivot joints, the loading on the 
joint is generally low since the joint is normally located 
between the cab portion of the vehicle and the load carrying 
portion of the vehicle. United States Patent No.4160619 discloses a vertical 
pivot joint which is located in the middle of a mine 
shuttlecar. The pivot joint in that patent has spaced upper 
and lower plates on a first section of the shuttlecar which 
are pivotally connected to spaced upper and lower plates on 
a second section of the shuttlecar. The pivotal connection 
incorporates bearing races, which are spaced apart to 
accommodate a pair of steering rams between them. Because 
of the spacing size and type of the bearing races, the joint 
cannot withstand high loads. The invention is directed to an articulated joint for 
pivotally connecting adjacent sections of a vehicle such as 
a mine shuttlecar. The joint includes upper and lower 
slewing rings, each of which includes an outer annular 
member and an inner annular member with a bearing race 
located between the two annular members. The inner and 
outer annular members of each slewing ring are connected and 
each outer annular member is connected to one section of the 
vehicle and each inner annular member is connected to a 
second adjacent section of the vehicle. The connection of  
 
the outer annular members of the slewing rings to one 
section of the vehicle and the connection of the inner 
annular members of the slewing rings to a second section of 
the vehicle permits the vehicle sections to rotate relative 
to each other about a substantially vertical axis. In a preferred arrangement, an annular cylinder is 
welded to the upper and lower plates of one section of the 
vehicle and a coaxial inwardly extending annular tongue is 
welded to the inner surface of the cylinder. The tongue is 
preferably formed with a plurality of circumferentially 
spaced threaded blind bores extending parallel to its 
central
