<ABSTRACT>
An oily lubricant for mixing with the refrigerant 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(R134a) is an ester of viscosity 2-30 mm²/s 

at 100
o
C. 
Suitable classes of esters are (1) polyesters of a polyol 
and straight or branched chain carboxylic acid (CA), (2) diesters 

of neopentyl glycol and a C6-9 CA, (3) complex esters 
of partial esters of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol with 

C3-C9 fatty acids and aliphatic or aromatic di-CA, (4) C16-22 
diallyl esters of aliphatic di-CA, (5) C18-26 diethyl 

esters of aromatic di-CA, and (6) diesters of an addition 
product of an alkylene oxide to a monohydric alcohol by an 

aliphatic di-CA. 
The viscosity is adjusted by using mixture of esters 
or by adding a polymer; suitable viscosity for a refrigerator 

is 2-9 mm²/s and for a car air conditioner it is 7-30 mm²/s. 
The ester should be purified to have a low acid number 
of 0.1-0.5 mg KOH (g), to prevent metal corrosion, whilst 

keeping high insulating property, and it is purified so as 
to be stable and to have no more than 500 ppm of moisture. 
An anti-wear agent of the sulfur type is preferably added 
in amount of 0.01-5 w/t%, and other additives can be an anti-oxidant 

and corrosion inhibitors. 
The lubricant has excellent compatibility with R134a, 
low hygroscopicity, high thermal stability and lubricating 

property.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of
a composition comprising a lubricant and the
refrigerant 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in which lubricant
has excellent compatibility with the refrigerant, low
hygroscopic property, high thermal stability and
lubricating property.R11 (CCl3F) is used as a refrigerant for air-conditioning
systems in buildings, and R12 (CCl2F2) is used for electric
refrigerators for foodstuffs or as refrigerant for automotive
air-conditioning systems of the rotary or reciprocating
type. However, they cause destruction of ozone in the
stratosphere, and alternative substances are urgently needed.In recent years, R123 (CF3CHCl2) has been considered as
an alternative for R11, but it has some problems such as high
price or toxicity. R22 (CHClF2) is being considered as an
alternative for R12 because of its easiness to decompose;
however, the operating pressure at normal temperature is high
because of its low boiling point, and pressure-resistant equipment
is needed. Also, there are the problems of leaking from
packings and hose components as well as problems of low electrical
insulating property.On the other hand, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a),
known as an alternative for R12, does not contain chlorine
which cause ozone destruction, and has passed acute and subacute
toxicity tests. Thus, attention is now focused on its
application.Our EP-A-90310832 claims a refrigerant composition of
R134a and a specified polyoxy propylene glycol alkyl ether
of high viscosity.At present, polyether synthetic oils of high viscosity
are under development as lubricating oils. The operating
temperature of a lubricating oil for a refrigerant is normally
between -30 and 100°C; when a polyether synthetic oil is mixed
with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane refrigerant, these substances
separate from each other at high temperature and there also 
are problems in its hygroscopic property and lubricating property.The requirements for lubricating oils for refrigerant
are: wide temperature range for compatibility with refrigerant
(compatibility), i.e. no clouding at high temperature (high
solvation of refrigerant to lubricating oil), high molecular
polarity of lubricating oil, no separation of lubricating
oil from refrigerant at low temperature (high solubility of
lubricating oil to refrigerant, and low molecular weight of
lubricating oil). For this reason, high compatibility with
the refrigerant is very important, and it is necessary that
the substance is not separated from the refrigerant at high
or low
