<ABSTRACT>
Projection apparatus comprises a projection lens 
arranged to project an image from the apparatus and an image 

carrier (such as an L.C.D. array, film or slide) which is 
retained in the apparatus in such a way so as to be tiltable 

about a pivot axis. Because the image carrier is tiltable, 
"keystone effect" typical of projected images may be reduced or 

substantially prevented. The projection lens is preferably 
tiltable also and coupled to the tilting of the image carrier to 

reduce further "keystone effect" and improve image resolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with projection 
apparatus. According to the present invention, there is provided 
projection apparatus comprising projection lens means arranged 
to project an image from the apparatus and means for retaining 
an image carrier element spaced from the projection lens means, 
wherein means is provided for tilting the image carrier element 
about a respective pivot axis. It is preferred that the image carrier is arranged to 
be tilted in the direction of light travel through the image 
carrier, preferably toward the projection lens. It is greatly preferred that the projection lens is 
also arranged to be tilted, advantageously by an angular extent 
proportional to the degree of tilting of the image carrier 
element. Desirably, the projection lens is arranged to be 
tilted by the same angular extent as the image carrier element. Typically field lens means is provided to direct light 
from a source through the image carrier element toward the 
projection lens means. Desirably the field lens means comprises 
a Fresnel lens. It is preferred that the projection lens means 
and image carrier element are tiltable about their respective 
axes relative to the field lens means. Desirably, the pivot axes of the image carrier element 
and the projection lens means are fixed relative to one another 
and preferably also fixed relative to the remainder of the 
apparatus. It is preferred that the pivot axes of the image 
carrier element and the projection lens means are arranged such 
that the optically transmissive portions of the image carrier 
element and projection means lens are not intersected by their 
respective pivot axes. In other words, it is preferred that the 
projection lens means and the image carrier element are edge 
pivoted.  Desirably, the pivot axes are arranged such that all 
the optically transmissive portions of the projection lens means 
and image carrier element (that is, those portions through which 
it is intended light should pass) are arranged to be tilted in 
the same direction, preferably in the direction of light 
propagation through the apparatus. It is preferred that the projection lens means and 
image carrier element are coupled relative to one another such 
that tilting angular movement of one causes corresponding tilting 
angular movement of the other by substantially the same angular 
degree. Desirably a mechanical linkage mechanism is provided for 
coupling the image carrier element and projection lens means, 
although alternatively electronic or
