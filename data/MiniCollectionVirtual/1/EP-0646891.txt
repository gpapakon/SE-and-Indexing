<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for interrogating a 
transponder using a single transmitter-receiver antenna (16) 

transmits an interrogation signal to the transponder. The 
transmit signal has two segments; a first segment for 

energising the transmitter-receiver antenna (16) and a 
second segment having a second phase for cancelling energy 

in the transmitter-receiver antenna. The amount of energy 
is reduced before the transponder transmits a response 

signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to communications
between a transponder and a transmitter-receiver antenna and
more specifically to reducing the residual power remaining
in a transmitter-receiver coil after transmitting an
interrogation signal to the transponder.In applications such as automotive burglar alarms, it
is desirable to use a single coil to transmit a relatively
high power interrogation signal to energise a transponder
carried by a particular individual. The transponder lacks
its own power source but uses the power in the interrogation
signal to transmit a relatively low power response signal to
the transmitter-receiver coil. The response signal contains
information such as an identification code.One problem associated with such a system is that
residual power remains in the coil even after the coil is no
longer driven with the interrogation signal. This remaining
residual power takes time to decay from the transmitter/
receiver coil. If the response signal arrives at the coil
before the remaining residual power in the coil is
adequately reduced, the response signal can be corrupted or
undetectable.U.S. Patent No. 5,025,492 uses a damping circuit to
reduce the power in the antenna. The circuit, comprised of
a switch and several resistors, is adapted to be connected
to the antenna after sending an interrogation signal and
disconnected before receiving a response signal. However,
the addition of several components and the increased board
size increase the cost of the system. Another problem with
using additional components is that heat is generated by the
additional components which must be removed. The document FR-A- 2 632 421 describes a transmitter
and receiver system for identification messages, the system
being applicable to distinguish between enemy and friendly
aircraft. The system operates by modifying the preamble of
an identification message which is transmitted from an
interrogating transmitter. The modification includes
inversions of the phase of the transmission.The U.S Patent No. 3 663 935 describes a pulse
recognition coding and decoding system for use in a binary
phase coded high resolution radar. The transmitter is
modulated with different codes at successive pulse
repetition periods. A waveform is composed of a series of
discrete sub-pulses, each successive one of which has a
phase which differs from the preceding sub-pulse by a fixed
amount so that the phase versus time plot of the waveform
appears as a binary code.An advantage of the invention is that it provides a
reduction

<CLAIMS>
A method for interrogating a transponder using a single
transmit-receive antenna, comprising the steps of:


generating a first transmission signal having a
first phase for a time interval which energises said

transponder;
generating a second transmission signal after said
first transmission signal having a second phase which

reduces residual energy in said antenna before the
transponder returns a response signal;
transmitting a response RF signal from the
transponder; and
receiving said response signal on said antenna
after the reduction in residual energy in said antenna

by the second transmission signal.
A method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the
steps of:


sensing the energy in said antenna;
deactivating said second transmission signal after
said energy in said antenna is reduced below a

predetermined threshold.
A method as claimed in claim 2, further comprising the
step of generating said second transmission signal as a

series of pulses having a successively decreasing energy
level until said energy level in said antenna means is below

said predetermined threshold.
Apparatus for reducing residual power in a transmitter-receiver
antenna, comprising:


antenna means (16) for transmitting and receiving
RF signals;
driving means (30), electrically connected to said
antenna, for providing energy to said antenna; and 
control means (18), electrically connected to said
driving means (30), for controlling the operation of

said driving means by generating a transmission signal;
characterised by
said transmission signal having two segments, a
first segment having a first phase followed by a second

segment having a second phase different from said first
phase so that said second segment reduces the energy

remaining in said antenna means after said first
segment;
a receiving means (34), electrically connected to
said antenna means (16) and said control (18), for

receiving a signal corresponding to the energy in said
antenna means; and
said control means (18) being adapted to generate
said second segment until the energy received by said

receiving means (34) drops below a predetermined level.

segment is 180 degrees out of phase from said first segment.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein said second
segment consists of a sequence of pulses having a decreasing

An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein said
receiving means (34) includes a comparator for generating a

voltage signal when the energy level from said antenna (16)
corresponds to a predetermined level.
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 4, wherein said
driving means comprises a pulse width generator (32).
