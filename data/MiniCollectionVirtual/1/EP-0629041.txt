<ABSTRACT>
An automatic frequency control apparatus 
includes a local oscillator (13), a quadrature detector, a 

frequency offset value estimation circuit (17), a 
demodulation circuit (15), a synchronization determination 

circuit (16), a memory (19), and an AFC circuit (18). The 
synchronization determination circuit (16) determines 

reception synchronization on the basis of demodulated 
signals from the demodulation circuit to output a 

synchronization determination signal to the AFC circuit (18) 
when reception synchronization is established and 

outputs the value to the AFC circuit. The apparatus 
also includes a power-on state detection circuit (20) for 

outputting a detection signal to the AFC circuit (18). The 
AFC circuit (18) determines the oscillation frequency of the 

local oscillator on the basis of the outputs from the 
above components. An automatic frequency control method 

is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
frequency control apparatus and a method therefor which 
are used in a microwave band satellite communication 
system or the like and always establish reception 
synchronization at a high speed even when a power supply 
is frequently turned on/off. Fig. 3 shows the arrangement of a conventional 
automatic frequency control apparatus. Referring to 
Fig. 3, this automatic frequency control apparatus has 
mixers 1 and 2 for respectively outputting an I (In 
Phase) signal and a Q (Quadrant Phase) signal serving as 
pseudo synchronization detection signals of a baseband 
from a received input signal Sa of an IF or RF frequency 
band, a local oscillator 3 for controlling an 
oscillation frequency on the basis of the value of an 
AFC (Automatic Frequency Control) voltage Sv to output a 
local oscillation signal So to the mixer 1, and a 90° 
phase shifter 4 for phase-shifting the local oscillation 
signal So by 90° (π/2) to supply the phase-shifted 
signal to the mixer 2.  In addition, this automatic frequency control 
apparatus has a demodulation circuit 5 for performing 
demodulation on the basis of the I and Q signals from 
the mixers 1 and 2, a frequency offset value estimation 
circuit 7 for estimating the frequency offset value of 
the I and Q signals serving as the pseudo 
synchronization detection signals when no reception 
synchronization is established, and an AFC circuit 8 for 
outputting the AFC voltage Sv to the local oscillator 3 
on the basis of the output from the frequency offset 
value estimation circuit 7. An operation of the arrangement of this prior 
art will be described below. After a power supply is turned on, the 
frequency offset value of received signals is estimated 
by the frequency offset value estimation circuit 7. The 
AFC circuit 8 outputs the AFC voltage Sv on the basis of 
the frequency offset value to shift the local 
oscillation signal So output from the local oscillator 
3. This shifted local oscillation signal So is supplied 
to the mixer 1 and phase-shifted by 90° (π/2) using the 
90° phase shifter 4, and the phase-shifted signal is 
supplied to the mixer 2. In this case, a frequency 
offset occurring when the power supply is turned on is 
removed, the I and Q signals serving as the pseudo 
synchronization detection signals of the baseband are  
 
obtained from the received input signal Sa in the mixers 
1 and 2, respectively. In the automatic frequency control apparatus 
operated as described above, estimation of a frequency
