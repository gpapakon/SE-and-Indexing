A magnetic bearing regulator for stable mounting of a body 
(1) which is borne free of contact in the magnetic field of a 

stator, and that magnetizable components in the stator co-act 
with magnetizable components of the body, comprising at 

least two electrical coils (2, 3; 15, 16; 17, 18) connected in 
series as bearing elements which as a pair of coils serve 

both as a position sensor and electromagnetic control 
element, and that the magnetic field of the stator described 

as pre-magnitization extends parallel to the direction of 
magnetization of the coils, and that the pair of coils (2, 3: 15, 

16; 17, 18) is electrically connected in series and 
magnetically in opposition and with its two outer ends 

connected to a respective output of an amplifier (4, 5; 4a, 5a; 
4b, 5b), and that the regulator comprises an oscillator (7) for 

generating a high-frequency sensor signal which is picked off 
between the two coils of the pair of coils (2, 3; 15, 16; 17, 18) 

and fed via a high-pass filter (12, 12a, 12b) to a rectifier (8, 
8a, 8b), and the output of the rectifier is connected to the 

amplifiers (4, 5; 4a, 5a, 4b, 5b), 
characterized in that
 one 
of the two amplifiers (5, 5a, 5b) delivers the inverted output 

signal of the other amplifier (4, 4a, 4b), that the 
high-frequency signal of the oscillator (7) is applied to the 

input of the amplifier (4, 5; 4a, 5a; 4b, 5b), that the rectifier is 
a phase-sensitive rectifier (8, 8a, 8b) which is synchronized 

with the high-frequency signal of the oscillator (7), and that 
the output of the rectifier (8, 8a, 8b) is connected via a 

downstream regulating network (9, 9a, 9b) to the amplifiers 
(4, 5; 4a, 5a; 4b, 5b). 
A magnetic bearing regulator according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that
 the amplifiers (4, 5; 4a, 4b; 5b) are two  
 

inverting amplifiers, and that the input of one of the two 
amplifiers (4, 4a, 4b) is connected to the output of the other 

amplifier (5, 5a, 5b). 
A magnetic bearing regulator according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 a low-pass filter (13, 13a, 13b) is 
inserted between the output of the phase-sensitive rectifier 

(8, 8a, 8b) and the input of the regulating network (9, 9a, 9b). 
A magnetic bearing regulator according to one of the above 
Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 a plurality of pairs of 
coils (15, 16; 17, 18) is arranged for the purpose of stabilizing 

a plurality of degrees of freedom, and that a regulating circuit 
of the above is provided for each pair of coils. 
A magnetic bearing regulator according to Claim 4 

characterized in that
 two pairs of coils with coils (15, 16; 17, 
18), which are magnetically uncoupled and arranged in a 

radial plane of the body (1) at a distance from the body on 
opposite sides of the body, are connected 90Â° offset relative 

to each other in such a manner that each pair of coils (15, 16; 
17, 18) acts respectively in its capacity as a position sensor 

for the other pair of coils (17, 18; 15, 16) in its capacity as a 
control element.
