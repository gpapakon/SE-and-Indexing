<ABSTRACT>
A moling apparatus (2) comprises a housing (4) having a head (8) for penetrating ground, an anvil (16) disposed in the housing connected to the head, a hammer (18) disposed in the housing and spaced therefrom by resilient restraint means (20). A vibrator unit (42) is spaced from the hammer and arranged to transfer vibration to the housing and the hammer. In a first mode of the apparatus, vibration transmitted to the housing causes fluidization of the surrounding ground to allow progressive penetration of the apparatus. In a second mode, the braking effect of the ground on the head causes the hammer to move against the resilient means and impact the anvil thereby driving the head through the ground, said apparatus being operable at or between said modes.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MOLING APPARATUSThis invention relates to moling apparatus.Moling apparatus, is used for making holes in the ground, driving pipes into the ground, driving explosives into the ground for, mining or military engineering, and for driving coring tubes into the ground to take core samples.Of the above-mentioned uses of such apparatus, making holes in the ground for pipes, cables and ducts, is an increasingly important area of use for such apparatus because of the advantages such trenchless laying techniques have over the traditional open trench method. Not only are trenchless methods much less labour intensive, they are also less harmful to the environment.However despite the apparent advantages of such apparatus over open trench methods, existing moling devices are not utilised as extensively as they could be. This is because existing machines tend to be unreliable, difficult to steer accurately without expensive guidance systems, inefficient, and unable to respond to differing ground conditions as the nature of the ground penetrated by the device changes.US 5031706 discloses a self-propelled pneumopercussive ground penetrating machine which addresses some of the above- mentioned problems in an attempt to produce a machine having a decreased energy consumption and increased velocity. The machine includes a hollow cylindrical housing, having a pointed head section, a striker which reciprocates inside the housing and an air distribution mechanism. The machine operates by accelerating the striker by compressed air to cause it to impact the front end of the housing. As a result of the impact the machine penetrates the soil a certain distance. The striker then travels backwards and is braked. This cycle is then repeated. US 5031706 is particularly 

concerned with a valve operated air distribution mechanism which is claimed to increase the efficiency of the machine compared with earlier designs of pneumopercussive machines.The machine includes means for informing an operator of the rate of progress of the machine through the ground so that the operator can tell if the machine hits an obstacle, such as a rock and the operator can put the machine into reverse mode and attempt to steer round the rock. However despite the apparent improvements over existing moling devices the machine disclosed in US 5031706 is complicated in design and would appear to be expensive to manufacture due to its complicated design. Further although an increase in efficiency is apparently achieved over existing moling devices, US 5031706

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A moling apparatus comprising a housing having a head for penetrating ground, an anvil disposed in the housing connected to the head, a hammer disposed in the housing and spaced therefrom by resilient restraint means, and a vibrator unit spaced from the hammer and arranged to transfer vibration to the housing and the hammer; characterised by a first mode wherein the vibration transmitted to the housing causes fluidization of the surrounding ground to allow progressive penetration of the apparatus, and by a second mode wherein the braking effect of the ground on the head causes the hammer to move against the resilient means and impact the anvil thereby driving the head through the ground, said apparatus being operable at or between said modes.
2. An apparatus according to Claim 1 wherein the vibrator unit comprises a mass oscillatable between two compression springs said unit being separately disposed in said housing.
3. An apparatus according to Claim 2 wherein the mass is caused to oscillate by a pneumatic, hydraulic or electrical system.
4. An apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein the head is generally conical and includes a series of concentric steps.
5. An apparatus according to Claim 4 wherein the head is eccentrically mounted and remotely rotatable thereby allowing the apparatus to be steered in use. 



6. An apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein spacer rings are provided between the anvil and the head to enable adjustment of the separation of the anvil and the hammer.
