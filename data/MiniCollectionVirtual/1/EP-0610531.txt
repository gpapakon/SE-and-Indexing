<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a deinking composition for 
reclaiming waste paper, which is used in the preparation of 
regenerated pulp from printed waste paper such as newspaper, 
magazines, journals, wood-free paper, copying paper and computer 
printout paper and a method for using the deinking composition. More specifically, the present invention relates to a deinking 
composition and a method of using the same, which are suitable for 
deinking printed waste paper through flotation, can provide high 
quality regenerated pulp having a high brightness and a low content 
of residual ink and can ensure a stable deinking operation. There has long been known methods for reclaiming printed waste 
paper to give starting materials for paper-making. In particular, the 
reclaiming of printed waste paper has increasingly become important 
from the viewpoint of saving energy and natural resources as well as 
protection of environment and correspondingly there have been required 
for the development of techniques capable of providing high quality 
regenerated pulp having excellent properties such as a high 
brightness and a low content of residual ink. In general, methods for deinking printed waste paper can roughly 
be divided into two groups, one of which is a washing method and the  
 
other of which is a flotation method. There have been known a variety 
of literatures and knowledges relating to these processing methods, 
deinking mechanisms and difference in quality between deinking 
compositions used in these processing methods. See, for instance, 
Pulp & Paper, 1986, Nov., p. 59; Pulp & Paper, 1989, Mar., p. 60; 
Pulp & Paper, 1990, Mar., p. 76; Pulp & Paper, 1989, Mar., p. 97; 
Japanese Journal of Paper Technology, 1980, Aug., p. 37; 1989 TAPPI 
Pulping Conference, p. 343; Japan TAPPI Journal, Vol. 36, p. 1029; 
Japan TAPPI Journal, Vol. 39, p. 747; and US-A-4,483,741 
and 4,518,459. When summarizing literatures and, knowledges and experiences 
which have been obtained through practical operations, the washing 
method in general comprises the step of repeatedly diluting and 
dehydrating a pulp slurry, or removing separated and dispersed ink 
particles from the pulp slurry through a screen or with a washing 
equipment such as a centrifugal cleaner. In this method, the 
separation of ink is greatly dependent upon, principally, mechanical 
conditions for due to washing equipments such as a press, a screen and 
a cleaner. Moreover, the washing method suffers from various problems 
concerning consumption of
