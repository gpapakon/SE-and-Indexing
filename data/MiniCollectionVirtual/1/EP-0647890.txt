<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a processing module (1) for a modular automation system, for example a modular programmable controller, the automation system comprising a central unit (15) and peripheral units (16, 17) subordinate to the central unit (15), for example input/output subassemblies (16, 17), the peripheral units (16, 17) being able to be coupled to each other via a device bus (11). According to the invention, the processing module (1) has a processor (2), a memory (3, 4), a blockable bus coupling element (5), which can be coupled to the device bus (11), and a blockable central unit coupling element (6), which can be coupled to the central unit (15), all of which can be connected to one another via a module bus (10) which is internal to the processing module. As a result, the central unit (15) or the peripheral units (16, 17) can optionally be monitored and the central unit (15) can be relieved to a considerable extent of administration activity.

A processing module (1) for a modular automation
system, for example a modular stored-programmable

control system, wherein the automation system consists
of a central unit (15) and peripheral units (16, 17)

subordinate to the central unit (15), for example
input/output assemblies (16, 17), which peripheral units

(16, 17) can be coupled to one another via a device bus
(11), and wherein the processing module (1) comprises a

processor (2), a memory (3, 4), a blockable bus coupling
element (5) capable of being coupled to the device bus

(11), and a blockable central unit coupling element (6)
capable of being coupled to the central unit (15), which

are connected to one another via a module bus (10)
internal to the processing module, and wherein the

processing module (1) has at least one alarm interface
which is connected to the processor (2) - preferably via

the module bus (10) - and which can be connected to a
current supply device (20) for process control elements

(19).
A processing module according to Claim 1,
characterised in that it comprises a programming

interface (7) connected to the processor (2).
A processing module according to Claim 2,
characterised in that the programming interface (7) is

connected to the processor (2) via the module bus (10).
A processing module according to one of the above
claims, characterised in that it comprises at least one

communications interface (8) connected to the processor
(2). 
A processing module according to Claim 4,
characterised in that the communications interface (8)

is connected to the processor (2) via the module bus
(10).
A modular automation system, for example a modular
stored-programmable control system, for controlling a

technical plant (25) or a technical process via process
sensor elements and process control elements (19),

consisting of a central unit (15), a processing module
(1) according to one of the above claims, and peripheral

units (16, 17), which peripheral units (16, 17) are
coupled to one another via a device bus (11), wherein

the processing module (1) is coupled via its bus
coupling element (5) to the device bus (11) and via its

central unit coupling element (6) to the central unit
(15) and wherein the alarm interface (9) of the

processing module (1) can be connected to a current
supply device (20) for the process control elements

(19).
A modular automation system according to Claim 6,
characterised in that the central unit (15) is also

directly coupled to the device bus (11).
A monitoring process for a modular automation
system which consists of a central unit (15) and

peripheral units (16, 17) which are connected to the
central unit (15) via a device bus (11) and to which

process sensor elements and process control elements

(19) are connected, wherein

the central unit (15) cyclically reads in input
signals from the peripheral units (16, 17),

calculates output signals from the input signals on
the basis of an application program, and outputs 

these output signals to the peripheral units (16,
17),
the input signal read in by the central unit (15)
are communicated to a processing module (1) or the

processing module (1) likewise cyclically reads in
the input signals,
the processing module (1) likewise calculates
output signals from the input signals on the basis

of the application program and compares these
output signals with the output signals calculated

by the central unit (15), and
upon noting a malfunction of the central unit (15)
the processing module (1) disconnects the process

control elements (19) independently of the central
unit (15) via a disconnect path which is

independent of the device bus.
