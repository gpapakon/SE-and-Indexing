<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed in general toward methods and 
apparatus for selecting target particles from a sample fluid and, more particularly, 
toward improved apparatus for controlling the operation of a device for 
performing immunoselection of target cells. Various methods and devices exist for separating component parts 
of a sample fluid to obtain target particles. These methods include filters, 
centrifuges, chromatographs, and other well-known fluid separation methods. 
Other apparatus and methods exist for separating a particular cell subpopulation, 
or target cells, from a mixture of cells. These methods include gross separation 
using columns, centrifuges, filters, separation by killing of unwanted cells, 
separation with fluorescence activated cell sorters, separation by directly or 
indirectly binding cells to a ligand immobilized on a physical support, such as 
panning techniques, separation by column immunoadsorption, and separation 
using magnetic immunobeads. Such immunoselection methods have been used to 
either positively or negatively select target cells, wherein positive selection refers 
to the direct selection and recovery of specific target cells, while negative selection 
refers to the elimination of a specific target cell subpopulation from a 
heterogeneous population of cells. Columns are common to the above described methods for general 
separation of target particles from a sample fluid and for the more specific 
immunoselection methods for selecting target cells from a sample fluid. Typically, 
a column has an entrance end, an exit end, and a substrate positioned 
intermediate the entrance and exit ends. In operation, the sample fluid is 
provided to the entrance end of the column and is moved through the column 
under pressure. As the fluid passes through the column, the substrate separates 
the target particle from the fluid composition so that the target particle exiting the 
column will be substantially pure. The target particle exiting the column is 
collected and retained as the collected product of the separation. Accordingly, the 
substrate is selected for a particular separation to separate the target particle from 
the sample fluid.  
 Various substrates exist for use with columns to separate the target 
particle from the sample fluid. Generally, the type of substrate selected for 
performing the separation will determine how the target particles are separated 
from the sample fluid. As an example, with substrates typically used in 
chromatography, the
