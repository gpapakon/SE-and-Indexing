<ABSTRACT>
An embodiment of a sensing element (10) for a gas 
vapor detector (24) is formed from a gold-palladium 

alloy. The sensing element (10) is highly sensitive to 
phosphine or arsine gas. The by volume palladium 

concentration of the sensing element is typically less 
than 20 %. The sensing element (10) is used as an active 

element in a gas vapor detector (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
determining the presence and concentration of a vapor
in a gas.In the past, a variety of materials have been
utilized as sensing elements within gas vapor
detectors. The material utilized to form the sensor
element typically is determined by the gas to be
detected. For example, some typical materials utilized
for detecting phosphine gas include rhodium, potassium
covered silver, oxidized iron, or gold. One
disadvantage of these prior sensing elements is the gas
concentration that can be detected. These prior
sensors generally cannot detect phosphine
concentrations that are less than about 10 parts per
billion. Additionally, the prior sensors cannot detect
such low levels of arsine gas.Both phosphine and arsine are commonly used
materials in semiconductor processing areas. Since
both gases are highly toxic, it is desirable to detect
even the smallest amount of either gas in the
environment.EP-A-0 488 352 discloses a semiconductor gas
sensor with a gold-palladium alloy layer.US 5,173,166 discloses an electrochemical gas
sensor cell. It is generally disclosed that a
catalytically active noble metal is chosen from the
group consisting of platinum, palladium, rhodium,
iridium, ruthenium, silver, gold, and alloys and 
mixtures thereof. US 5,173,166 does not disclose the
selection of gold-palladium alloy from among this range
of possibilities.Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 8, no. 259 (P-317)

Tekunoroji) 27 July 1984 discloses a reductive gas
sensor having a thin film electrode insulative
semiconductor film formed on metal and counter
electrode formed on film.Accordingly, it is desirable to have a method of determining the presence and concentration of a
vapor in a gas
that facilitates detecting phosphine
concentrations of less than approximately one part per
billion, and that facilitates detecting arsine
concentrations of less than approximately one part per
billion.The present invention provides a method of
determining the presence and concentration of a vapor
in a gas, as claimed in claim 1. FIG. 1 illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional
