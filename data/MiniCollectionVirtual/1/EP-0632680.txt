<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic devices, and, more particularly, to 
electrostatic discharge protection devices and methods. Many electronic components, such as integrated circuits, MOS 
transistors, diodes, and thin film capacitors are sensitive to electrostatic 
discharge (ESD) and may be damaged during handling. Indeed, the gate 
oxide in CMOS integrated circuits may be on the order of 200 Å thick and 
will breakdown at 15-20 volts between the gate and the transistor substrate. 
Of course, this 15-20 volts greatly exceeds the normal operating voltage, and 
built-in ESD protection may prevent damage from somewhat higher voltages 
transiently applied to integrated circuit package pins. But, during handling, 
electrostatic buildup on a person walking across a room can easily reach 
15,000 to 20,000 volts. This high voltage arises from the electric charge 
generated by rubbing two dissimilar materials together (triboelectric 
charging effect). The discharge of triboelectric charge into the pins of a 
packaged transistor or integrated circuit may damage the circuit sufficiently 
to cause immediate failure or to weaken the circuit to cause subsequent early 
failure. And on-chip ESD protection devices do not provide sufficient 
protection without overly encumbering the electrical characteristics (i.e., 
protection diodes introduce capacitance and protection resistors add to RC 
time delays). One approach to providing ESD protection employs conductive clothing 
for individuals handling ESD sensitive items plus conductive grounded wrist 
straps and ground mats for discharging accumulated electrostatic charge. 
However, this approach has problems including the expense of providing 
electrically conductive clothing or walkways and the ambulatory limits 
imposed by wrist strap tethering.  The present invention provides an electrostatic charge dissipator for 
direct attachment to an individual and employing cold field emission. The drawings are schematic for clarity. Figure 1 shows in perspective view first preferred embodiment 
electrostatic charge dissipation system. Figures 2-3 are plan and cross sectional elevation views of the first 
preferred embodiment charge dissipator. Figure 4 is an enlarged cross sectional elevation view of the first 
preferred embodiment charge dissipator. Figures 5a-b illustrate electron emission. Figures 6a-c show fabrication steps in enlarged cross sectional views. Figure 7 shows a second fabrication method. Figure 8 is an enlarged cross sectional elevation view of a second
