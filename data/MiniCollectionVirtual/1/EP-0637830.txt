<ABSTRACT>
An electrical switch is provided having 
first (76) and second (78) interdigitated poles and 

a through pole (80) passing therebetween. Each of 
the first and second poles have 

multiple fingers (82,84) spaced-apart and coplanar with 
one another. The through pole 

meanders through, is spaced-apart from and coplanar with the fingers of the other 
poles, and does not box in the other poles of the switch. In a keypad embodying an 

array of switches, the poles of each switch are connected to conductive traces that 
are brought out to an edge of the keypad. The traces are formed on one surface of 

the keypad. The through pole allows one or more of the poles of the switches in the 
keypad to be interconnected and brought to the edge of the keypad while remaining 

on the same surface of the keypad, thereby permitting the use of a single electrical 
connector for coupling the switches to other circuitry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to switches used in electric circuits and, more 
particularly, to mechanical switches having multiple poles. Mechanical switches, as the term is used herein, refers to switches that require 
some sort of physical movement (hence the term mechanical) in order to operate the 
switch. These switches may be operated either manually or automatically. Examples 
of mechanical switches include membrane, rotary, pushbutton, slide and toggle 
switches. Mechanical switches typically consist of a shorting bar and one or more 
spaced-apart poles connected to electric circuits. Operating the switch causes the 
shorting bar to either make or break contact with the poles, thereby completing, 
interrupting, or otherwise changing the connections of the electric circuits. Typically, the poles of single and double pole switches are placed on one 
surface or layer of the switch. It is desirable to do this because it simplifies switch 
construction. By having the poles on one surface, connecting the poles to electric 
circuits is greatly simplified. However, prior art switches having three or more poles, 
usually have the poles located, at least partially, on more than one layer of the switch. 
Sometimes, for example, the shorting bar acts as the third pole in a three pole 
membrane switch. The disadvantage associated with this type of pole arrangement is 
that the poles are on different layers and must somehow be combined on one layer so  
 
that they can be easily terminated at a single connector. Jumpers can be used to 
place the poles on one surface or multiple connectors could be used. Unfortunately, 
both approaches increase the complexity and cost of manufacturing the switch. Another example of three pole switch construction found in the prior art is 
where all three poles are located on one layer spaced apart from the shorting bar. In 
a keypad incorporating an array of this type of switch, in which there are common 
poles, it is difficult to route the poles so that they do not cross over other poles. Either 
hard-wire jumpers are used at pole crossings or one of the traces will be formed on 
another surface of the layer to avoid crossing another pole. In the latter situation, 
plated through holes are used to continue the trace when it transitions to the other 
side of the switch layer. Once again, hardwired jumpers and through holes increase 
the complexity and cost of the switches. Obviously, if the switch has more than three 
poles, the cost and complexity of this type of
