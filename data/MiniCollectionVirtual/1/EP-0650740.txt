<ABSTRACT>
An interventional catheter for angioplasty and the like, 
comprising a catheter tube 1 formed of two superposed 

layers 2 and 3 of materials different from one another. 
The inner layer 2 is comprised of a low friction non 

kinkable material to avoid risk of clogging of a guide 
wire 11 in the longitudinal lumen 12. The outer layer 

3 is comprised of a material with higher friction coefficient 
than the material forming the inner layer. The 

balloon 4 is welded at its distal end 5 to the outer 
layer 23 of the catheter tube. The proximal end 6 of 

the balloon 4 is welded to a tube 7 surrounding the 
catheter tub
e 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interventional catheter
comprising a catheter tube having two superposed layers
of materials secured in relation to one another and
with mechanical properties differing from one another,
a longitudinal lumen in said catheter tube for the sliding
fit of a guide wire, and a balloon with a proximal
end and a distal end, whereby the distal end sealingly
surrounds said catheter tube, whereby the catheter tube
has an inner layer forming the longitudinal lumen and
an outer layer forming the outer surface of the catheter
tube, and the inner layer is formed of a material with
lower friction coefficient than the material forming
the outer layer.Over the wire catheters are now widely used for interventions
such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
A problem with these catheters is that the guide wire
may clog into the longitudinal lumen of the catheter;
as a result, the guide wire may follow the balloon upon
withdrawal thereof after the inflation procedure, thereby
making it necessary to re-insert the guide wire into
the treated area of the blood vessel for re-positioning
a balloon therein in case a second inflation is needed.
Apart of this, the catheter has to achieve an acceptable
compromise between the requirements of some stiffness
to assure good pushability and of some flexibility to
assure kink resistance. In addition, the catheter has
to permit safe attachment of the balloon to the catheter
tube.The document WO 92/11893 describes an intra-aortic balloon
apparatus comprising a hollow catheter in which
is located an elongated member forming a central lumen
extending out of the catheter at the distal end thereof.
An aortic pumping balloon is positioned over the elongated
member; the distal end of the balloon is bonded
to a tip affixed to the distal end of the elongated 
member, and its proximal end is bonded to the distal
end of the catheter. In order to achieve a balance of
flexibility and remains and to avoid kinking, the elongated
member is formed of an inner layer comprised of
a soft elastomeric material to impart flexibility to
the tubing, and the outer layer is comprised of a hard
plastic material to impart structural support to the
elongated member. The combination of these two layers
is made to achieve a very durable and flexible structure
exhibiting a low kink radius. This balloon apparatus
cannot be loaded with a guidewire and moved into tortuous
vessels with the guidewire loaded inside the elongated
tube. The friction between guidewire and the elongated
member
