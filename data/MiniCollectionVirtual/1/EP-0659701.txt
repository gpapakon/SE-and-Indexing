<ABSTRACT>
A coating system for individual glass fibers (12) of a lightwave 
communications system has improved strippability, particularly in situations where a 

group of such fibers are arrayed together in what is 
known as a ribbon (20). A preferred 

embodiment includes two layers (primary (14) and secondary (15)) 
of polymeric 

materials surrounding the glass fiber (12). The primary layer (14) 
comprises an oligomer 

(50-80% by weight), a diluent (15-40% by weight), and additives (5-35% by weight). 

The oligomer comprises polyol "A," diisocyanate "B," and a hydroxy-terminated alkyl 
acrylate "C" having the structure C-BA-B-C. At least one of the additives contains a 

non-crosslinked hydrocarbon component (1-20% by weight) having a structure R₁ - 
(R)
n
 - R₂; where R₁, R₂ comprises an alkyl group or an OH group, and R is a 
combination of C, H or C, H, O. In an alternative embodiment, 

the need for a diluent 
is substantially eliminated by using an oligomer having the structure E-D-E where "D" 

represents a carboxy-terminated polyol, and "E" represents a glycidyl acrylate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a protective coating for an optical 
fiber, and more particularly to a coating which can be easily removed from the optical 
fiber. In the manufacture of optical fiber, a glass preform rod is suspended 
vertically and moved into a furnace at a controlled rate. The preform softens in the 
furnace and a glass fiber (also referred to as an optical fiber) is drawn freely from the 
molten end of the preform rod by a capstan located at the base of a draw tower. 
Because the surface of the glass fiber is susceptible to damage caused by abrasion, it 
is necessary to coat the fiber after it is drawn but before it comes into contact with any 
surface. Inasmuch as the application of a coating material must not damage the glass 
surface, the coating material is applied in a liquid state. Once applied, the coating 
material must solidify before the glass fiber reaches the capstan. This is typically 
accomplished within a brief time interval by photocuring -- a process in which the 
liquid coating material is converted to a solid by exposure to electromagnetic 
radiation. Because the fibers are thin and flexible, they are readily bent when 
subjected to mechanical stresses such as those encountered during handling or 
exposure to varying temperature environments. Such bends in the fiber frequently 
result in loss that is much greater than the intrinsic loss of the fiber itself, and it has 
been found desirable to protect the glass fiber against such bending. Accordingly, the 
coating material is required to cushion the glass fiber against bends and two layers of 
coating materials are typically applied to the drawn optical fiber. An inner (primary) 
coating, having a relatively low modulus, is applied directly to the glass fiber; and an 
outer (secondary) coating, having a relatively high modulus, surrounds the primary 
coating. Together, these coatings desirably protect the inherently high tensile strength 
of the glass fiber so long as the primary coating material remains bonded to the glass. 
However, in what appears to be a contradictory requirement, it is also desirable to be 
able to easily strip the coating(s) from the glass fiber -- particularly when a number of 
fibers are bonded together in an array such as shown in U. S. Patent 4,900,126 which 
leads to yet another performance attribute that coating materials need to possess. 
Indeed, if the coating materials cannot be cleanly and easily stripped, then splicing 
and connectorizing operations will be seriously hampered.
