<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an anti-vibration (damping) device including two rigid skeletons (1, 2) which are parallel and perpendicular to a first axis (Z) and at least one laminated element (5) interposed between the two skeletons, the said laminated element consisting of alternate layers of rigid material and elastomer which are located perpendicularly to the first axis, the said laminated element allowing the relative displacement of the two skeletons along a second axis (Y) perpendicular to the first one. According to the invention, the device further comprises a hydraulic damper which has at least two deformable leaktight pockets (A, B) connected by a restricted passage (C), the two leaktight pockets and the restricted passage being filled with a liquid, each leaktight pocket being at least partially delimited by a deformable wall (6) which is fixed to the two skeletons allowing their relative movement parallel to the second axis.

a bearing face (3, 4) facing the other rigid strength 

member, the two bearing faces being disposed opposite 
each other and perpendicularly to a first axis Z; and 
at least one laminated element (5, 5') interposed 
between the two bearing faces (3, 4), said laminated 

element having two opposite faces that are secured to 
respective ones of the two bearing faces, said laminated 

elements being made up of alternating layers of rigid 
material and of elastomer which are disposed 

perpendicularly to the first axis Z, said laminated 
element being capable of deforming to permit relative 

displacement of the two strength members along a second 
axis Y perpendicular to the first axis Z; 
the device being characterized in that it further 
comprises a hydraulic damper having at least two 

deformable leakproof chambers (A, B) interconnected by a 
narrow channel (C), the two leakproof chambers and the 

narrow channel being filled with a liquid, each leakproof 
chamber being delimited, at least in part, by a 

deformable wall (6, 6') which extends between a first end 
(6

(2), said deformable wall, on deforming, permitting 

relative movement of said first and second ends parallel 
to the second axis Y. 
A device according to claim 1, in which the deformable 
wall (6) of each sealed chamber is made of elastomer and 

exerts a resilient return force on the strength members

) extending parallel to the first axis Z and open 
adjacent to the first strength member (1), said housing 

communicating with the two leakproof chambers (A, B) via 
two respective openings (9), the first strength member 

including a fixing member (10) which is engaged in sealed 
contact inside the housing (8

A device according to claim 3 or 4, in which the 
elastomer body (7) is housed inside a rigid peripheral 

wall (11) which extends from the second strength member 
(2) along the first axis Z, the second end (6
2

deformable wall being fixed to said rigid peripheral 

wall, said rigid peripheral wall being disposed between 
two laminated elements (5) along a third axis X 

perpendicular to the first axis Z and to the second axis 
Y, the rigid peripheral wall constituting an abut
ment 
that limits deformation of the two laminated elements 

parallel to the third axis X. 
A device according to any one of claims 3 to 5, in 
which the second end (6
2
) of each deformable wall is 
secured to a rigid frame (12) and co-operates with said  

 
frame to form an outwardly directed peripheral flange 

(13) on which a metal plate (14) is crimped which closes 
said second end of the deformable wall.
