<ABSTRACT>
A communication and processing system (10) for 
monitoring signals transmitted from personal transmitter 

units (PTUs 20) to determine whether alarm or emergency 
conditions have occurred and whether scheduled 

communications from PTUs (20) are missing. The PTUs (20) 
detect various alarm and emergency conditions and transmit 

data communications to a field node (18). The field node (18) 
receives data communications from all PTUs (20) within range. 

If a data communication indicates an emergency condition, a 
field report message is immediately sent to a control facility 

(12). If a communication indicates an alarm condition, an 
audible alarm is sounded at the field node but no message is 

sent to the control facility yet. If the alarm condition is not 
corrected within a predetermined period of time, a message 

describing the alarm condition is sent to the control facility 
(12). When scheduled communications from a PTU (20) are not 

received at the field node (18), the situation is treated as an 
alarm condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to systems and
methods for monitoring objects and particularly for
monitoring people. More specifically, the present invention
relates to systems and methods for monitoring a plurality of
monitorees in a field setting.In field settings, observers often have the job of
monitoring any number of dispersed monitorees. In one
situation, a prison corrections officer has the role of observer
while prisoners on work crews are monitorees. In another
situation, a teacher has the role of observer while children on
a field trip are monitorees. In still another situation, an
operations manager or coordinator may have the role of
observer while any number of persons involved in search and
rescue missions, fire fighting, or other hazardous operations
(e.g., electrical and/or natural gas distribution system repair
and/or installation operations, chemical plant workers etc.),
are monitorees. In these and other situations, the observer's
job is often a difficult one which requires constant attention.
A single momentary lapse in diligence on the part of the
observer can lead to disastrous consequences.Typically, an observer's responsibilities include, among
other things, knowing the whereabouts of monitorees even
though monitorees may be dispersed over a large or obscured
area. In addition, an observer's responsibilities often include
the exercise of good judgment in knowing when to ask for
additional help and when not to ask for additional help. The
observer typically needs to quickly recognize when additional
help is needed, and the observer typically needs to quickly 
communicate that need when the occasion arises.Due at least in part to the difficult nature of the
observer's job, field activities are often severely restricted
and undesirably costly. Often a large number of observers are
required for a given population of monitorees. When suitable
observers are not available, field activities are curtailed.
Labor costs of field activities are undesirably high when a
large number of observers are required for a given number of
monitorees. Likewise, when only a few observers are
available, the population of monitorees is often restricted to
only a few of the most trustworthy or competent monitorees.Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention
that an improved method and system for remote monitoring is
provided.Another advantage of the present invention is that a
system and method are provided which make an observer's job
easier.Another advantage is that the present

said field node, and data identifying a location for said field
node;
associating a detection unit (20) with each of said
monitorees;
from each of said detection units (20), repetitively
transmitting (90) one of said unique codes from time to time

in accordance with a predetermined schedule;
receiving at least a portion of said transmitted codes at
said field node (18);
activating (120) an alarm (52, 54) at said field node (18)
when one of said unique codes has not been received in

accordance with said schedule; and
sending (126) a field report message from said field node
(18) to said control facility (12) after a predetermined

duration has transpired following said activating step unless
said one unique code is received within said predetermined

duration, wherein said field report message comprises said
data identifying said field node and its location.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 additionally
comprising a step of sending (126) field report messages from

said field node (18) to said control facility (12) from time to
time when all said unique codes are received in accordance

with said schedule to keep said control facility (12) informed
of current situational status at said area. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 additionally
comprising steps of:


detecting tampering with said field node (18); and
sending (126) a field report message from said field node
