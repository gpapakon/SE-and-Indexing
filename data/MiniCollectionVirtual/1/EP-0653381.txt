A method of making a gas-impermeable shaped body of amorphous silica,
which body has a chemical purity of at least 99.9% and whose cristobalite content

is 1% at the most, with amorphous quartz glass of a purity of at least 99.9% being
comminuted as a starting material to a powder having a particle size of less than 

70 µm and a slip being provided from the powder, said slip for producing a
shaped-body blank being filled into a porous mold corresponding to the shaped

body and being left in said mold for a predetermined period of time, the shaped

wall thickness is 0.1 mm and whose direct spectral transmission in the
wavelength range λ = 190 nm to λ = 2650 nm is virtually constant and below 10%

at a wall thickness of 1 mm, the slip is stabilized by being constantly moved for a
period of 1h to 240 h prior to being filled into the porous mold, the dry body blank

is heated in the furnace at a heating rate of 5 K/min to 60 K/min to a sintering
temperature ranging from 1350°C to 1450°C and subjected to a temperature of

more than 1300°C for a period of at least 40 min, and the sintered shaped body
