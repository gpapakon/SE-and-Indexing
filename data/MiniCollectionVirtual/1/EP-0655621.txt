<ABSTRACT>
A method is proposed for measuring contaminations in the form of liquids, liquid films, solids and solid films in reusable bottles or containers, in particular made of plastic, using an optical spectrometer, with transmission (illumination) through the bottle or container wall, in particular in the foodstuffs or beverage industry, according to which the radiation emerging from the bottle wall in the most varied beam directions is diverted into one direction by means of a fibre light collector and subsequently fed to the spectrometer.
