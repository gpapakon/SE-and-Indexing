<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a time-division
multiplex switching network in a time-division broadband
exchange, and to a time switch.In a time-division broadband exchanger using
signals having frequencies of several hundreds of MHz or
higher, signal delays in the wiring pose a problem. In
order to solve this problem, an exchanger employing a frame
synchronization technique is known. An arrangement of the
conventional time-division broadband exchange is described
in US-A-4 894 821.In the conventional time-division broadband
exchange, in order to solve the problem of signal delays
in the wiring, a frame synchronization signal generator adds
a frame synchronization signal to data signals on an input
highway. The exchange is constituted by a plurality of
input highways, a plurality of output highways, a space
switch arranged between the input highways and the output
highways for, performing signal exchange between the input
and output highways, the frame synchronization signal
generators for providing the corresponding input highways
with the frame synchronization signals, respectively, a 
plurality of multiplexers connected in series with each of
the input highways for multiplexing the data signals and
the frame synchronization signal, respectively, a plurality
of demultiplexers connected in series with each of the
output highways for demultiplexing signals on the output
highways, respectively, a control memory for controlling
the space switch, and a plurality of phase difference
detectors arranged at the input terminal of the space
switch. The phase difference detector controls an output
frame phase of the frame synchronization signal generator
so that the frame phase of each input highway is aligned
with the reference phase of the space switch. In this
manner, the entire switching network can be synchronously
operated while compensating for signal delays.However, since this exchange is constituted by
the multiplexers, demultiplexers and the space switch,
exchange of the data signals multiplexed on the highways on
the time base cannot be performed. Therefore, when
multiple stages of exchanges are to be connected, the
blocking probability of the space switches is increased.
Thus, it is difficult to constitute a large-capacity
exchange. US-A-4 470 139 discloses a switching network for use in a
time division multiplex system for switching digital signals
carried in time slots on N incoming busses to time slots on
M outgoing busses. The switching network comprises a
plurality of storage means being
