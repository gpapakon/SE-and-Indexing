<ABSTRACT>
There is described the construction of recombinant 
plasmids containing human calcitonin cDNA sequences, using 

total poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from a human medullary 
carcinoma of the thyroid, the identification and characterisation 

thereof, and the use of such plasmids in the production 
of human calcitonin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA 
biotechnology. In particular it relates to the use of recombinant 
DNA biotechnology in the production of human 
calcitonin precursor structural gene, the insertion of said 
gene in vector system, the cloning thereof and subsequently 
the production of human calcitonin. Calcitonin is a small polypeptide hormone consisting of 
32 amino acid residues (3500 mol.wt) synthesized and secreted 
in humans by the C-cells of the thyroid gland. The main physiological function of calcitonin is to 
limit skeletal breakdown during times of calcium and phosphorus 
requirement, for example during growth, pregnancy 
and lactation. Thus for instance the absence of calcitonin 
during rapid growth in adolescence causes bone loss. A 
similar loss of bone may occur in pregnancy, when calcitonin 
secretion is absent. Calcitonin levels in men are higher 
than in women, and in both sexes, levels decline with age. 
This is particularly apparent in women after the menopause, 
where low levels of calcitonin appear to be an important 
factor in post-menopausal bone loss and osteoporosis. It 
is probable that should human calcitonin become commercially 
available in sufficient quantity, the peptide will be used 
alone or in combination with other drugs in the prevention 
and treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Calcitonin 
may also be helpful in the treatment of elevated plasma 
calcium due to malignant deposits in bone. The commonest 
cause of this is cancer in the breast with secondary deposits 
in the skeleton. The action here probably reflects in part 
inhibitory action of calcitonin in osteoclasts. The latter 
are partly responsible for increased bone destruction leading 
in turn to elevated plasma calcium levels. Calcitonin may 
also have a direct action on cancer cells in bone and thus 
may play a role in the action of calcitonin in lowering 
elevated plasma calcium levels due to malignant deposits 
in bone.  At present, calcitonin (purified from salmon) is used 
in pharmacological rather than replacement doses, for the 
treatment of Paget's disease. This is a common condition 
affecting, in the main, people over 40 years of age. In 
this group as many as 4% of the population may be affected.  
 
Thus in the U.K., for instance, although the disease is 
usually asymptomatic, there are tens of thousands of people 
needing treatment. Unfortunately prolonged treatment with 
salmon calcitonin has proved impracticable due to immunological 
rejection of the fish
