Fluid distribution valve interposed between a 
first chamber (9) and a second chamber (11), the valve 

being intended to place the two chambers in communication 
with each other and to isolate them from each other 

selectively, and including a valve body (1) and a moving 
shutter (2) guided in translation (4-16) in the valve 

body along an axis of sliding (8), the valve body comprising 
a passage linking the first and second chambers 

and emerging in the second chamber via an opening 
delimited by an edge (19), and the shutter having a 

sealing face (18) with a frustoconical shape, of axis (8) 
parallel to the axis of sliding (8) and capable of being 

brought to bear in sealed manner against the said edge 
(19);
 
in which: 


the valve body (1) further includes an annular 
face (12) of axis of revolution (8) parallel to the axis 

of sliding (8) and which face is arranged inside the 
second chamber (11), and 
the shutter comprises, on the one hand, a primary 
shutter (2) which comprises the said sealing face (18) 

capable of being brought to bear in a sealed manner 
against the said edge (19) and, on the other hand, a 

secondary shutter (3) which comprises an annular segment 
(31) which is coupled (33-35) elastically (36) to the 

primary shutter (2) and which is capable of being brought 
to bear in a sealed manner against the said annular face 

(12) of the valve body, characterized in that 

A) the said annular face (12) of the valve body 
(2) is spherical;  

 
B) the said annular segment (31) of the secondary 
shutter (3) is spherical; 
C) the primary shutter (2) has a cylindrical 
periphery (17) in which there emerge grooves (21) made in 

the primary shutter and extending between a solid cylindrical 
collar (22) and the said sealing face (18) of the 

primary shutter (2); 
D) the valve body (1) comprises a bore (6) inside 
which the said cylindrical periphery (17) and the said 

cylindrical collar (22) of the primary shutter (2) are 
mounted in such a way that they can slide; 
E) the primary shutter (2) and secondary shutter 
(3) have transverse faces (24-40) arranged facing each 

other and forming stops for limiting the relative axial 
travel of the said primary and secondary shutters; and 
F) the valve has a shut-off configuration in 
which, on the one hand, the sealing face (18) of the 

primary shutter (2) bears in a sealed manner against the 
edge (19) of the valve body (1) and, on the other hand, 

the spherical annular segment (31) of the secondary 
shutter (3) bears in a sealed manner against the spherical 

annular face (12) of the valve body (1), while when 
this shut-off configuration is achieved, the cylindrical 

collar (22) enters the bore (6) of the valve body by a 
depth (D22) which is greater than the distance (D24/40) 

separating the said stops (24-40) which limit the relative 
axial travel of the primary shutter (2) and secondary 

shutter (3). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the primary shutter (2) has a bore (25) inside which a 

cylindrical sleeve (26) integral with the secondary 
shutter (3) is inserted, a seal (28) being arranged 

between the said bore (25) and the said cylindrical 
sleeve (26). 
Valve according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the secondary shutter (3) has a recess (32) delimited by 

a bottom (29) while a screw (33-35), comprising a 
threaded shank (33) and a screw head (35), has its 

threaded shank (33) passing with clearance (J) through  
 

the said bottom (29) of the recess (32) of the secondary 
shutter (3) and screwed (34) into the primary shutter 

(2), and in that an elastic return member (36) is interposed 
between the bottom (29) of the recess and the screw 

head (35), the latter being arranged in the recess (32) 
with radial clearance (K) between itself and the wall of 

the said recess.
