<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel continuous process for the preparation of aromatic di- and polyamines by catalytic hydrogenation of the di- and polynitro compounds which correspond to the amines, at high temperatures and, if appropriate, simultaneous elimination of heat from the reaction mixture to produce steam of a superatmospheric pressure of 
>
/= 2 bar.

<CLAIMS>
A continuous process for preparing aromatic di and 
polyamines by catalytic hydrogenation of the 

corresponding aromatic di and polynitro compounds with 
hydrogen using hydrogenation catalysts, characterised 

in that, in a loop-Venturi reactor with ejector, 

a) the corresponding aromatic di or polynitro 
compound is introduced, without a solvent, into a 

rapidly flowing mixture which substantially 
consists of aromatic di or polyamines, finely 

divided suspended, solid hydrogenation catalyst, 
water and hydrogen, in such a way that 


a1) the di or polynitro compound is finely 
distributed in the mixture, 
a2) the ratio by volume of the recirculated, rapidly 
flowing mixture to the di or polynitro compound 

introduced is 50 to 500, 
a3) the ejector operates on the recirculated rapidly 
flowing mixture in such a way that an energy of 4 

to 40 kW/t of di or polynitro compound introduced 
is dissipated in the ejector mixing chamber, 
a4) and the ratio of volume flow of hydrogen admitted 
to the recirculated mixing volume is 0.1 to 7, 

wherein the hydrogen required is drawn into the 
gas chamber of the reactor and the hydrogen 

consumed during reaction is supplied to any point 
in the system, 
b) the reaction mixture is continuously withdrawn 
from the system, 
c) a pressure of 5 to 100 bar and an operating 
temperature of 120-220°C are maintained in the 

reactor and 
d) the heat of reaction is optionally used to 
produce steam. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a pressure of 10 to 50 bar is maintained. 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that an operating temperature of 150 to 200°C is 

maintained. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the reaction mixture is 

withdrawn from the system with retention of the 
catalyst. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the aromatic di or polynitro 

compound introduced is used in the pure form, as a 
mixture with the corresponding di or polyamine or as a 

mixture with the corresponding di or polyamine and 
water. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that 2,4-dinitrotoluene or its 

industrial grade mixture with 2,6-dinitrotoluene is 
used as the aromatic dinitro compound introduced.
