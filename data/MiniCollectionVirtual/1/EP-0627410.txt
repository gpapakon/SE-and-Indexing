<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to N-acylglutamine 
derivatives and to cosmetics and hair growth stimulants 
containing the N-acylglutamine derivatives. Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 
20438/78 discloses cosmetics containing esters of 
N-acylamino acids, and Japanese Published Unexamined Patent 
Application No. 223206/91 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 
5,112,613) discloses cosmetics containing N-acetyl-L-glutamine 
(NAG). NAG is stable but is poorly compatible with oily bases, 
and emulsion in cosmetics containing NAG is often unstable, which can 
lower the viscosity of such cosmetics. Therefore, kinds of 
cosmetics containing NAG and the amounts of NAG contained in 
cosmetics are limited. The object of the present invention is to provide 
N-acylglutamine derivatives which are more compatible with 
oily bases than NAG and are therefore stable in cosmetics 
and hair growth stimulants to have good skin-moisturizing 
activity in cosmetics and hair growth-stimulative effect in 
hair growth stimulants. The present invention relates to N-acylglutamine 
derivatives represented by formula (I):  
 
wherein R1 represents an alkyl having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, 
an alkenyl having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, 
wherein R3 represents an alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms; and R2 represents an alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The present invention also relates to cosmetics and 
hair growth stimulants containing the N-acylglutamine 
derivatives. The alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms for the 
definitions of R2 and R3 is a linear or branched alkyl 
including methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, 
pentyl and hexyl groups. The alkyl having 12 to 22 carbon 
atoms for the definition of R1 is a linear or branched alkyl 
group including dodecyl, tridecyl, myristyl or tetradecyl, pentadecyl, 
hexadecyl, heptadecyl, stearyl or octadecyl, isostearyl, 
nonadecyl, eicosyl, heneicosyl and docosyl 
groups. The alkenyl having 12 to 22 carbon atoms is a 
linear or branched alkenyl group including oleyl, dodecenyl, 
elaidyl, linoleyl and linolenyl groups. Compounds represented by formulae (I), (II), (III), ... 
are hereinafter referred to as Compound (I), Compound (II), 
Compound (III), ..., respectively. Methods for producing Compounds (I) are mentioned 
below.  
  
   wherein R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined 
above; and P represents a protective group for the amino 
group. As the protective group for the amino group, 
t-butoxycarbonyl group, benzyloxycarbonyl group, etc. are 
used. Compound (IV)
