<ABSTRACT>
Spiral tube (1) for devices for the artificial 
ventilation of patients, comprising: an inner tube (2) 

connectable between the humidifying and heating unit and 
the patient; a coil (11) provided on the outer surface of 

the inner tube; and an outer covering tube (15); thereby 
forming an insulating layer (10) about the inner tube (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spiral tube for 
devices for the artificial ventilation of patients. As it is known, in intensive-care wards, during long 
operations, when the patient is artificially ventilated, 
heated active humidifiers are used to humidify and heat the 
dry low-temperature gases that arrive from the ventilator 
of the respiration unit. The gases thus heated and humidified are conveyed to 
the patient over a portion of spiral plastic tube which is 
generally 1.5-2 meters long. Considerable heat dissipation occurs along this tube 
portion, with the consequent forming of condensate inside 
the tubes, since the relatively warm gases flowing along 
the tube are saturated with humidity, and cooling therefore 
unavoidably causes condensation. It is therefore necessary to interpose, along the 
inspiratory supply line, condensate traps that must be 
periodically emptied, consequently increasing the work 
burden for the nursing personnel. Another severe problem that directly affects the 
patient resides in the fact that said patient is fed with 
unsaturated gases at temperatures that are not always 
sufficient to ensure normal mucociliary functions. The principal aim of the present invention is to 
eliminate the drawbacks described above by providing a new 
type of spiral tube for devices for the artificial 
ventilation of patients that allows to significantly reduce 
the formation of condensate and to supply the patient with  
 
a gas in optimum temperature and humidity conditions. A particular object of the invention is to provide a 
spiral tube that, while having considerably improved 
characteristics, has substantially the same weight and 
flexibility characteristics as the tubes of the known art. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a spiral tube for devices for the artificial ventilation of 
patients that, due to its particular constructive 
characteristics, is capable of giving the greatest 
assurances of reliability and safety in use. According to the invention, there is provided a spiral 
tube for devices for the artificial ventilation of 
patients, comprising an inner tube connectable between the 
humidifying and heating unit and the patient, characterized 
in that it comprises an insulating layer arranged around 
said inner tube. Further characteristics and advantages of the spiral 
tube for devices for the artificial ventilation of patients 
according to the present invention will become apparent 
from the following detailed description of an embodiment 
thereof
