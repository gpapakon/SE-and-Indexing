<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic system 10 provides a positive supply of hydraulic fluid at 
a controlled pressure to plurality of pumps. The system comprises a fluid 

reservoir 15 having outlet means to supply fluid to an auxiliary pump 30. A 
pressure chamber 16 communicates with a reservoir 15 and has outlet means 

to supply fluid to a plurality of working pumps 11, 12, 13. An inlet 
manifold 18 is provided for receiving fluid returned from the working and 

auxiliary pumps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improvements in hydraulic
systems and in particular to a system for providing a
positive flow of hydraulic fluid to a number of open-loop
hydraulic pumps.Many mobile machines, such as road sweeping machines,
utilise hydraulic pumps for various duties. These duties
can include propelling the vehicle via a hydrostatic
transmission system, driving an exhauster fan with a
hydraulic motor to generate the suction source for
collecting debris, hydraulic drives for other apparatus
such as brushes, water pumps, cylindrical actuators and so
on. A feature often required of such mobile machines is
that they are expected to work in various climatic
conditions, from the hottest day in summer to the coldest
day in winter without any adjustments having to be made.Where the hydraulic pumps are "open-loop" pumps, the
pumps usually draw their oil directly from a reservoir
which then pressurises the working circuit with the
hydraulic fluid which is then returned to the reservoir via some
sort of filter prior to recirculation. To serve the pump
with fluid, the suction line, associated connections,
isolation valves and so on need to be of suitably large
proportions to ensure that cavitation does not occur in
cold conditions or on initial start-up at the beginning of
a working shift when the fluid is cold and naturally more
viscous. This has the disadvantage that the pipework and
associated equipment are generally larger than needed once
the system has warmed up, which means an increase in weight
of the apparatus and the cost. The positioning of the
reservoir relative to the pumps is also fairly critical to
ensure that positive pressure is provided to the pumps. In a well known hydraulic installation as
described in DE-A-2711137 a storage container for a
liquid pressure medium is divided into two chambers.
A supply of pressure medium for one or more ordinary
loads is drawn from the second chamber, whilst the
supply of pressure medium for a priority load is drawn
from the first chamber. There is a non-return
connection between the two chambers so that pressure
medium can flow from the first to the second chamber
only. The system is designed to guarantee a supply of
pressure medium to the priority load even if there are
very large losses of pressure medium and to enable
only a single fine filter and heat exchange to be used
for a number of operating circuits connected thereto.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide a hydraulic system which provides
a positive supply of fluid at a

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic system for providing a positive
supply of hydraulic fluid at a controlled pressure to

a plurality of pumps, comprising a fluid reservoir
(15); said fluid reservoir having outlet means to

supply fluid to an auxiliary pump (30); a pressure
chamber (16) having means for communicating with said

reservoir; said pressure chamber having outlet means
to supply fluid to a plurality of working pumps (11,

12, 13), a pressure relief valve (26), set at a
predetermined pressure setting, allowing the chamber

to vent fluid above the predetermined pressure to the
reservoir (15), characterised in that the

communicating means between the pressure chamber and
said reservoir are provided by an orifice 25 by means

of which fluid can flow in both directions between the
reservoir and pressure chamber and further

characterised by the provision of inlet means in the
pressure chamber for receiving all of the hydraulic

fluid returned from the working and auxiliary pumps.
A hydraulic system as claimed in claim 1 further
comprising a plurality of open-loop working pumps (11,

12, 13) connected to the outlet and inlet means of the
pressure chamber (16).
A hydraulic system as claimed in claim 1 further
comprising an open-loop auxiliary pump (30) connected

to the outlet means of the fluid reservoir (15) and
the inlet means of the pressure chamber (16).
