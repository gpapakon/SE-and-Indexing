<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a durable air-permeable mold having 
dimensional accuracy and without cracks due to the segregation of the 

ingredients of the aggregate and without a surface irregularity, 
which comprises compounding 100 parts by weight of an aggregate 

obtained by compounding metal powders with metal oxide powders in a 
weight ratio of 5:95 to 30:70, the metal of said metal oxide powders 

being the same as that of the metal powders, 80% or more of said 
metal powders and said metal oxide powders having grain sizes of 300 µm 

or less, with 10 to 35 by weight of an auxiliary hardening material 
that is softened and melted during the sintering process, and 10 to 

25 by weight of a binder that contains an evaporable component, 
mixing them to form a slurry mixture, pouring it in a pattern mold to 

obtain a mold, drying the thus-obtained mold, and sintering the dried 
mold in an oxidative atmosphere at a temperature of 600 to 1200°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing a durable air-permeable 
mold having fine and continuous pores all over it and 
having a fine pattern on its surface. Such a durable air-permeable mold can be, for example, used for 
the vacuum-molding method. This method is one in which after a 
thermoplastic sheet is heated and softened, it is made to cover a 
mold, the air-permeable surface of which is subjected to suction, and 
then the air present between the surface of the mold and the 
thermoplastic sheet is withdrawn to cause the sheet to adhere to the 
surface of the mold. Since this method has merits in that small to large molded 
products can be efficiently produced with relatively simple 
equipment, it has been widely utilized. Recently, fine patterns such 
as are obtained by embossing the surface of molded products are in 
demand to enhance the commercial value of molded products, or molds 
to obtain large molded products and high-dimensional accuracy are 
demanded. Also, such durable porous molds can be widely used not only for 
vacuum-molding, but also for blow-molding and other methods that 
require air permeability. As molds that satisfy such requirements, 
as shown in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-6620, the applicant has  
 
developed molds excellent in durability as well as having low costs, 
short-term delivery, and with good transferability and air-permeability. Additionally, it has developed various air-permeable and water-permeable 
molds that are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 
Nos. 63-65416, 1-53140, 2-27925, 3-23253, etc. All of these molds are obtained by mixing a liquid binder with a 
mixture of metal powders and ceramic powders or refractory powders, 
their specific gravities being very different, to form a slurry, 
casting the slurry into a pattern mold, solidifying the binder, 
drying the thus-obtained solid product, and then sintering the 
product in an oxidative atmosphere to oxidize and expand the metal 
powders to obtain an air-permeable mold with high strength, being 
sintered in a form such that the oxidized and expanded metal powders 
envelope the ceramic powders. However, these molds have a drawback in that in the above slurry 
a mixture of the ingredients of the aggregate starts to precipitate 
before the binder solidifies, and when the binder is solidified the 
segregation of the ingredients occurs since a difference between the 
sedimentation rate of the metal powders and that of the ceramic 
powders is apt to be caused, said metal powders and ceramic
