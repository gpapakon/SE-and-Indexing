<ABSTRACT>
An intermediate ring 1 is equipped with a plurality of pipe branches 2 for the inflow and outflow of a solvent. The pipe branches have flanges 3 which are flanged to corresponding flanges of feed lines and outlet lines for the solvent. For the installation of the intermediate ring between a discharge valve and a bottom flange of an agitator, mixer or dryer, an attachment flange 8 is mounted on the intermediate ring in a plane perpendicular to the flanges 3.

<CLAIMS>
An intermediate ring for an agitating, mixing or 
drying apparatus in which a granular solid is processed, 

wherein a plurality of connection branches (2) are 
arranged on the periphery of the intermediate ring (1) 

for feeding and removing a solvent or for feeding a 
pressurized gaseous medium, wherein each of the connection 

branches is equipped with a flange (3) and is 
connected to the interior of the intermediate ring via a 

bore hole (12), and wherein the intermediate ring (1) has 
a mounting flange (8) in a plane perpendicular to the 

flanges (3), for installation between a discharge valve 
and a bottom flange of the agitating, mixing or drying 

apparatus. 
The intermediate ring as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein a ring channel (7) is present on the periphery of 

the inside of the intermediate ring (1), which ring 
channel is connected via the bore holes (12) to the 

connection branches (2), and wherein the height of the 
ring channel (7) is greater than the inner diameter of a 

connection branch (2). 
The intermediate ring as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the ring channel (7) is open towards the interior 

(11) of the intermediate ring, and wherein the height of 
the ring channel (7) is less than the height of the 

interior (11) of the intermediate ring. 
The intermediate ring as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein a screen (4) separates the ring channel (7) from 

the interior (11) of the intermediate ring. 
The intermediate ring as claimed in claim 4, 
wherein the screen (4) comprises a fine screen (5), which  

 
faces the interior (11) of the intermediate ring, and a 

coarse screen (6), which faces the ring channel (7) as 
support fabric of the fine screen. 
The intermediate ring as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein the coarse screen (6) has a mesh width of 2 to 

3 mm, whereas the mesh width of the fine screen (5) is 5 
to 8 Âµm. 
The intermediate ring as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein bore holes (9) for bolts are arranged near the 

flange rim (10) of the mounting flange (8), distributed 
over the periphery, and wherein the intermediate ring (1) 

is bolted in place between an agitating, mixing or drying 
device and a discharge valve, using bolts passed through 

the bore holes (9) for bolts.
