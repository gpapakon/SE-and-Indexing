<ABSTRACT>
Carrier stock (10) is disclosed, which has band 
segments (30, 32, 34, 36, 38) defining container-receiving 

apertures (14) and, optionally, defining integral handles 
(40), along with tear-open tabs (50) arranged in four-tab 

clusters. Each cluster includes two tabs (50) proximate to 
each other and connected by a single, frangible bridge, 

respectively on opposite sides of the transverse mid-line 
of a generally transverse band segment (34). Each cluster 

includes two tabs (50) proximate to each other and 
connected by a single, frangible bridge, respectively on 

opposite sides of the longitudinal mid-line of a generally 
longitudinal band segment (32). Each tab (50) extends from 

one of the band segments (38), outwardly from its 
respective container-receiving apertures (14). Each tab 

(50) and the band segment (38) with such tab (50) are 
slitted to define a series of frangible bridges between an 

additional aperture (26) bounded partly by such tab (50) 
and a container-receiving aperture (14). A package 

comprising containers (12) and a carrier (20) severed from 
such stock (10) is disclosed and illustrated in (Figure 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to carrier stock for machine 
application to substantially identical containers to form 
packages. This invention pertains, more particularly, to 
carrier stock and resulting packages having tear-open tabs. Typically, carrier stock for machine application to 
substantially identical containers, such as cans or 
bottles, is formed, as by die-cutting, from a single 
sheet of resilient polymeric material. Such stock is 
formed with band segments defining container receiving 
apertures to receive the individual containers. Such stock 
is severable to form individual carriers. As exemplified in Weaver et al. U.S. Patent No. 
4,557,375, it is known to form such stock with band 
segments defining integral handles, which are disposed 
within container-receiving apertures when such stock is 
unstressed. As exemplified therein, the band segments 
defining the integral handles are connected to other band 
segments by frangible bridges, which are broken when the 
carrier stock is applied to the containers. As exemplified in Marco U.S. Patent No. 5,020,661, it 
is known to form such stock with tear-open tabs, which 
extend from certain of the band segments defining the 
container-receiving apertures. As exemplified therein, 
each tear-open tab extends from one of the band segments 
into one of the container-receiving apertures when the 
carrier stock is unstressed. If an attempt were made to 
provide the carrier stock disclosed therein with band 
segments defining integral handles that were disposed 
within container-receiving apertures, as exemplified in 
the Weaver et al. patent noted above, the tear-open tabs 
would interfere with the integral handles. There has been a need, to which this invention is 
addressed, for carrier stock formed with tear-open tabs 
that would not interfere with machine application of such 
stock and that would permit such stock to be also formed  
 
with band segments defining integral handles, which would 
be disposed within container receiving apertures when such 
stock was unstressed. This invention provides carrier stock for machine 
application to substantially identical containers. Although 
carrier stock according to this invention has particular 
utility where the containers are bottles, such as blow-moulded 
bottles for beverages, carrier stock according to 
this invention has additional utility where other 
containers are used, such as beverage cans. According to this invention a carrier stock made from 
a single sheet of resilient polymeric material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Carrier stock (10) for machine application to 
substantially identical containers (12), said carrier 

stock (10) being made from a single sheet of resilient 
polymeric material, said carrier stock having integrally 

joined band segments (30, 32, 34, 36, 38) defining 
container-receiving apertures (14) arranged in longitudinal 

rows and transverse ranks to receive the individual 
containers (12), the band segments including generally 

longitudinal band segments (30, 32) and generally 
transverse band segments (34, 36), said carrier stock (10) 

having tear-open tabs (50), each tear-open tab (50) 
extending from an associated one of the band segments (38) 

defining an associated one of the container-receiving 
apertures (14), wherein selected ones of the generally 

transverse band segments (34) define transverse mid-lines, 
along which said stock (10) is severable to form individual 

carriers (20), characterised in that the end-most 
transverse rank of apertures in each individual carrier 

includes said tear-open tabs (50) which extend away from 
the associated aperture creating radially extending 

clusters, the tear-open tabs (50) of each cluster 
including two tear-open tabs (50) on each side of such a 

transverse mid-line. 
A carrier stock according to claim 1, wherein the 
generally longitudinal band segments (32) between the 

longitudinal rows of the container-receiving apertures (14) 
have longitudinal mid-lines, wherein the tear-open tabs 

(50) are arranged in clusters, and wherein the tear-open 
tabs (50) of each cluster include two tear-open tabs (50) 

on each side of such a longitudinal mid-line. 
A carrier stock according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the tear-open tabs (50) of each cluster are connected to 

one another by frangible bridges (52). 
A carrier stock according to any one of the preceding 
claims, having at least one integrally joined band segment  

 
(40) defining an integral handle, which is disposed within 

a selected one of the container-receiving apertures (14) 
when said carrier stock (10) is unstressed. 
A carrier stock according to claim 4, having integral 
handles (40) in two diagonally opposed container-receiving 

apertures (14). 
A carrier stock according to claim 4 or 5, wherein 
the band segments defining the container-receiving aperture 

(14) that includes the integral handle (40) also include 
one of the tear-open tabs (50). 
A package comprising a carrier (20) formed from 
carrier stock in accordance with any one of the preceding 

claims, in combination with substantially identical 
containers (12) arranged in a generally rectangular array 

with one of the containers (12) being received in each of 
the container receiving apertures (14).
