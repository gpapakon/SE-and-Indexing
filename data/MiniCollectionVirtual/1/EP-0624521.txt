<ABSTRACT>
Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 

cases, formed by a body that takes in pallets loaded with 
cases and has an end stop mechanism where there is a 

column with means of elevating a vertically-moving bridge, 
equipped with a horizontal shaft whose ends bear 

hydraulically-operated means of grasping each pair of 
cases at the top of [illegible word]
 loaded on the pallet 
and carrying them to the emptying area, comprised of a 

conveyor band which is placed over the case and then 
flipped over, such that the upturned case lies on the band 

which carries the contents and case to the edge, where it 
is emptied. The empty cases fall onto a means of 

conveyance lying perpendicular to the preceding band, and 
there they are carried to an area where empty cases are 

fitted inside one another in groups of six to be 
palletized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention will be applied in that sector of 
industries which handles the depalletization of all kinds 
of packing cases, their emptying, and lastly the 
repalletization of the empty cases, all automatically, 
regardless of the contents of the aforesaid cases, 
preferably fruit of any sort which is to undergo later 
selection. There is a machine with these same functions, patented 
by the applicant in patent number 8902188 and the 
corresponding patent amendment number 9001490, which has 
similar mechanisms but, due to its complexity and numerous 
elements, is not suitable for production rates of less 
than 1000 cases per hour. Therefore the new, improved 
machine mentioned herein has been designed to omit 
mechanisms and form a more simply operated, easily 
manufactured and serviced group. Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 
cases formed by an intake body through which the machine 
is fed, with a driving chain on which the pallets loaded 
with cases are placed. On the far end there is a very 
sturdy side pole which serves to hold a vertically-sliding 
frame. This frame supports a horizontal shaft on each end 
of which is mounted a grip for grasping from the pallet 
the pair of cases encompassed in each movement. There is 
furthermore a conveyor belt which is first placed on top 
of the cases and then, by means of a 180° turn, the cases 
are flipped over such that their contents lie on the said 
conveyor belt. The motion of the belt conveys the cases and their 
contents together to the edge of the belt, at which time  
 
the contents fall onto another conveyor belt set up at a 
lower level leading to the handling zone, while the empty 
cases fall onto a second band made up of a group of 
rollers and belts running perpendicularly to the preceding 
ones, to carry the said cases to an exit ramp where each 
pair of empty cases are turned 90° in one direction and 
180° and 90° in the opposite direction, respectively, to 
place the cases facing one another and insert one into the 
other for later palletizing. Furthermore the empty pallets are carried by a set of 
rollers and chains to a stacking area where they are 
picked up by a forklift. All this automates in the minimum space the process of 
depalletizing cases, emptying them, coupling the empty 
cases to occupy the least possible volume, and then 
palletizing them, while the pallets that are emptied are 
picked up. The following is a detailed description of the machine 
for automatically
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 

cases wherein at the end of the body where the pallet 
loaded with cases is located, there is a very strong 

column along which a sliding frame runs vertically by 
means of an elevator system, and the said frame is 

equipped with a horizontal shaft on whose ends are 
installed hydraulically-operated grips for holding the top 

pair of cases loaded on the pallet and carrying them to 
the emptying area. 
Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 

cases as set forth in claim one above, where in the 
emptying area is comprised of a conveyor band which is 

positioned on top of the cases and a mechanical turning 
assembly which flips the cases upside down with their 

contents resting on the said conveyor band, which, when 
started up, slides the cases and contents toward the exit 

where emptying takes place and the contents fall onto 
another conveyor band which carries them to the handling 

area. 
Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 

cases as set forth in claims one and two above, wherein 
the empty cases fall onto a roller area and are belt-driven 

by a set of bands in a direction perpendicular to 
the preceding direction, to the empty case palletizing 

area. 
Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 

cases as set forth in claims one to three above, wherein 
the palletizing area begins with a ramp a
nd a 90°-turning 
system a 180°-turning system and another system turning 

 
90° in the direction opposite from the first, allowing 

each pair of empty cases to be inserted in the preceding 
pair, forming six-case packets which are stacked for 

palletizing. 
Improved machine for automatically 
depalletizing/emptying/palletizing all kinds of packing 

cases as set forth in claims one to four above, wherein 
under the general body is a system of rollers and chains 

which picks up the empty pallets and carries them to a 
stacking area to be picked up later by a forklift. 

As described and claimed in this descriptive Report 
comprised of 8 numbered pages typewritten on one side 

only.
