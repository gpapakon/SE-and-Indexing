<ABSTRACT>
A control apparatus for a hydraulically operated 
vehicular transmission has a plurality of hydraulic 

engaging elements including a first hydraulic engaging 
element (C1) which is kept engaged in a plurality of 

transmission trains. The control apparatus has an 
accumulator (21) which is connected, via a branched oil 

passage (L14), to a working oil passage (L2) which is 

communicated with the first hydraulic engaging element 
(C1). It also has a control valve (22) which is disposed 

in the branched oil passage (L14) and which can be moved 
between a first position in which an upstream portion of 

the branched oil passage on a side of the first hydraulic 
engaging element (C1) and a downstream portion of the 

branched oil passage on a side of the accumulator (21) are 
brought into communication with each other and a second 

position in which the communication is shut off. It 
further has an oil discharge passage (LD) which is 

connected to a second hydraulic engaging element when the 
second hydraulic engaging element is disengaged. This 

oil discharge passage (LD) is arranged to be connected to 
the downstream portion of the branched oil passage (L14) 

in the second position of the control valve (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control apparatus
for a hydraulically operated vehicular transmission which
has a plurality of hydraulic engaging elements, as defined
in the precharacterizing part of claim 1.In a hydraulically operated transmission for use in
a vehicle such as an automobile, it is normal practice to
effect the speed changing or shifting by controlling the
engaging or disengaging of a plurality of hydraulic
engaging elements. In this case, unless an appropriate
control is made of a simultaneous engagement of a
hydraulic engaging element to be engaged and a hydraulic
engaging element to be disengaged at the time of speed
changing, there will occur speed-change shocks (i.e.,
shocks at the time of speed shifting). As a solution, the
following arrangement is disclosed in Japanese Published
Unexamined Patent Application No. 180756/1988 corresponding to DE-A-3 801 362. Namely, an
accumulator is provided in parallel with each of the
hydraulic engaging elements, and an oil discharge control
valve is provided in an oil discharge passage that is 
connected to the hydraulic engaging element to be
disengaged. The pressure decrease in the hydraulic
engaging element to be disengaged is buffered or cushioned
by the accumulator that is parallelly connected thereto
and causes a simultaneous engagement to take place. Once
the hydraulic oil pressure in the hydraulic engaging
element to be engaged has increased to a certain degree,
the oil discharge control valve is opened to rapidly
decrease the hydraulic oil pressure in the hydraulic
engaging element to be disengaged, thereby preventing an
excessive simultaneous engagement.If one accumulator must be provided for each of the
hydraulic engaging elements as in the above-described
conventional example, there is a disadvantage in that a
large number of accumulators are required and consequently
that the control apparatus becomes large in size.By the way, in the above-described conventional
example, there is interposed in the first-speed
transmission train a one-way clutch which allows for
overrunning of the output side. The first-speed
transmission train is thus established by engaging the
hydraulic engaging element for the first-speed
transmission train and, while this hydraulic engaging
element is kept engaged, other hydraulic engaging elements
are respectively engaged to thereby establish the other
transmission trains. As described above, in the 
transmission provided with a hydraulic engaging element
that is kept engaged in a plurality of transmission

A control apparatus for a hydraulically operated vehicular
transmission, said control apparatus having a plurality of

hydraulic engaging elements including a first hydraulic
engaging element (C1) which is kept engaged in a plurality

of transmission trains, said control apparatus comprising:

an accumulator (21) which is connected, via a branched
oil passage (L14), to a working oil passage (L2) which is

communicated with said first hydraulic engaging element (C1);
a control valve (22) which is disposed in said branched
oil passage (L14) and which can be moved between a first

position in which an upstream portion of the branched oil
passage on a side of said first hydraulic engaging element

(C1) and a downstream portion of the branched oil passage on
a side of said accumulator (21) are brought into

communication with each other and a second position in which
said communication is shut off;

   characterized in that a restricted flow oil discharge
passage (LD) is provided which, when connected to a second

hydraulic engaging element (C2; C3), causes said second
hydraulic engaging element (C2; C3) to become disengaged,

said oil discharge passage (LD) being arranged to be
connected to said downstream portion of said branched oil

passage (L14) in said second position of said control valve
(22), when said second hydraulic element (C2; C3) becomes

disengaged, for buffering the drop in pressure in the second
hydraulic element (C2; C3).
