<ABSTRACT>
An interface circuit is provided to allow substitution of digital output rotation sensors 
such as fiber optic gyroscopes (13) or ring laser gyroscopes (77) in place of spinning mass 

gyroscopes. The pulses generated from the fiber optic gyroscope, or from a ring laser 
gyroscope are converted to a voltage representative of volts per degrees per second and are 

summed with an inverted (33) volts per degrees per second command (31) at an integrating 
summing amplifier (29, 27, 35) to result in an error signal in volts per degrees per second 

when there is a difference between the actual output of the gyroscope (13') and the command 
signal (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interface circuit which permits substitution of digital
output rotation sensors in place of spinning mass analog rotation output sensors in existing
analog output sensor configured systems. More specifically, the invention relates to an
interface circuit which permits substitution of fiber optic gyroscopes or ring laser gyroscopes
in place of spinning mass gyroscopes.A number of aircraft, satellites or other vehicles presently in use rely on spinning mass
gyroscopes having an analog output for use in guidance of the vehicle. Typically, such
gyroscopes are connected to onboard electronics and provide an analog output which is
processed to provide guidance information to the operator or a computerized control system
of the vehicle, for example, a pilot or an onboard computer.With the advent of fiber optic gyroscopes and ring laser gyroscopes, these types of
devices have increasingly replaced spinning mass gyroscope systems because of their
accuracy and reduced size and weight. Thus, modern day aircraft are constructed with such
fiber optic gyroscopes and ring laser gyroscopes, and with appropriate electronics configured
for operation with the fiber optic gyroscopes or ring laser gyroscopes. When employed, the
output of these newer types of devices is digital in nature and the electronics employed is
adapted for processing the digital output for use in vehicle navigation.Although such modern vehicles are increasingly constructed with the fiber optic
gyroscope systems or ring laser gyroscope as a component thereof, it also has become
desirable to replace the spinning mass gyroscope systems of older vehicles with the more
modern and lighter fiber optic gyroscopes or ring laser gyroscopes. (see e.g. Proceedings of the IEEE 1986 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference NAECON 1986, Dayton, Ohio (USA), 19-23 May 1986, pp 1115-1119, R. Cox et al..) A problem with such
replacement however, is that the electronics on the older vehicles are configured for
operating with the spinning mass system and it has been thought that to implement such fiber
optic gyroscopes or ring laser gyroscopes in older vehicles, the entire electronics must be
converted to the type presently in use with the newer types of devices. This can be costly and
cumbersome. In accordance with the invention, retro-fitting of the entire electronics of older
systems is avoided while permitting replacement of the older spinning mass-type gyroscopes
with the more modern fiber optic gyroscope or ring laser gyroscope
