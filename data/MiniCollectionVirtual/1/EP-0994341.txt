<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring the distribution of the internal refractive index of an optical
fibre preform (1) and a measuring unit for enabling the measurement of the distribution of

refractive index of a high NA optical fibre preform. A picture image 6 is located behind the
optical fibre preform 1, which is cylindrical and has an uneven distribution of refractive

index in the inside of the material. A deflected picture of said picture image 6 is
photographed through the optical fibre preform 1. By analysing the deflected picture of said

picture image, the deflection function is found and the distribution of the refractive index of
the optical fibre preform 1 is found based on the deflection function. The measuring device

comprises a picture image 6 of a pattern having position data, an incoherent light source for
lighting the picture image 6, a supporting unit (11) for supporting the optical fibre preform

1 in front of the picture image 6, a photographing unit 3 for photographing the deflected
picture of the picture image 6 through the optical fibre preform 1, an arithmetic and logic

unit for finding the deflection function from the photographed defected picture and for
finding the distribution of the refractive index of the optical fibre preform 1 based on the

deflection function, and a display unit for displaying the result of computing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of measuring the distribution of internal
refractive index for a preform of an optical fibre and a measuring unit.Optical fibre is important as an information medium supporting intelligent society.
The performance of the optical fibre depends on the shape of the refractive index
distribution formed at the inside of the fibre. It means that measuring techniques for
inspecting the formed structure is essential for adding to the precise control technique of the
shape of the refractive index distribution. In this case, the inside of the optical fibre is hard
to measure in detail and is large in error because of its extremely thin diameter. Therefore,
ordinarily the fibre is measured at the step of preforming (optical fibre perform, hereinafter
called preform) which is an intermediate product before wire drawing the optical fibre. The
structure of the refractive index for the optical fibre is determined at the inside of the
preform by a CVD method, VAD method, and so on. Since the structure of the preform
and the structure of the optical fibre are likely to be similar, it is considered that the result
of measuring the preform can be applied to the optical fibre by a reduction of scale. The
optical fibre is produced by softening the preform with heat and by drawing it to a
predetermined diameter.In the conventional method of measuring the refractive index of the optical fibre
preform, the deflection function is found by permeating the measured object with parallel
rays or thin laser radiation and by measuring the reflection of the rays received by the
distribution of the internal refractive index.However, if the measured object is large in the change of refractive index, such as a
high NA (number of opening) optical fibre preform, the angle of deflection of the
transmitted light becomes large so that the light does not come into the sight of a detector.
In other words, the rays have a large angle of deflection which is hard to detect and leaks
from measurement so that the accuracy of the measurement decreases sharply.Japanese patent application 04095847, published on 27th March 1992, discloses an
arrangement for the high speed measurement of a refractive index distribution in an optical 
fibre preform. The arrangement makes use of an inclined light line beam which is placed in
front of the optical fibre preform and the incident light from the light line beam after
passing through the preform is incident upon an image sensor, the output of which is then
taken to an
