<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for inspecting subsidiary canals that branch off from a main drain. A camera probe (24) is deflected from the main drain pipe (10) into the branching off subsidiary canal pipe (12) by means of a deflecting frame (22; 76; 96). The process is characterized by a propulsion by reaction of the camera probe (24), a fluid under pressure being supplied to reaction jets (34; 90) mounted on the camera probe so as to drive the latter into the subsidiary canal pipe (12).

pipe (10) by means of a diverting frame (22; 76; 

96) into the branching subsidiary canal pipe (12), 
characterised in that the camera probe (24) is 

driven in the subsidiary canal pipe (12) by 
reaction propulsion, by supplying a pressure 

medium to reaction propulsion nozzles (34; 90) 
attached to the camera probe. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that a locating device for 

transmitting locating signals is attached to the 
camera probe, and in that the position of the 

camera probe introduced into the canal is measured 
above ground with reference to the locating 

signals.

out repair or maintenance works in the subsidiary 

canals, characterised in that a working device for 
the repair or maintenance works is mounted on the 

camera probe.

according to Claim 1 or 2, having a camera probe 

(24) and a diverting frame (22; 76; 96), which can 
be secured in the main drain pipe (10), for 

diverting the camera probe into the subsidiary 
canal, characterised in that the camera probe (24) 

is provided with reaction propulsion nozzles 
(34; 90) and is connected to a flexible tube (36) 

for supplying a pressure medium to the reaction 
propulsion nozzles. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the reaction propulsion 

nozzles (34) are formed on a nozzle ring (32) 
surrounding the camera probe (24) at its 

circumference at a distance from its front end and 
are directed obliquely outwards relative to the 

axis of the canal probe (24). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that a camera cable (40) 

connected to the camera probe (24) is integrated 
in the flexible tube (36). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 
4 to 6, characterised in that the diverting frame 

(96) is formed by a cylindrical unit (98) on the 
rear end of which a push rod (100) is secured  

 
eccentrically and the rear end of which forms an 

oblique deflecting face (102) for the camera probe 
(24). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the diverting frame has a 

tubular mount (26) which is formed to accommodate 
the camera probe (24) and which is secured 

pivotably to a main drain probe (14; 78). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that the main drain probe (78) is 

a basket-like substantially cylindrical frame to 
the front end of which the mount (26) is pivotably 

secured with a hinge (84) and which is provided 
with guide rings (88) for a traction rope (86) for 

pivoting the mount, which rings are arranged 
radially outside the hinge (84). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterised by at least one guide roll (42) for 

the flexible tube (36), which guide roll is 
attached to the mount (26) or to the main drain 

probe (14; 76). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 
8 to 10, characterised by a guide member (54), 

which is pivotable relative to the main drain  
 

probe (14), for diverting a flexible flushing tube 
(52) which can be introduced into the subsidiary 

canal pipe (12) independently of the camera probe 
(24). 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that the guide member (54) is a 

guide channel attached to the mount (26). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 
8 to 12, characterised in that a drive mechanism 

having at least one drive roller set (44; 48) for 
feeding the flexible tube (36) and/or the flexible 

flushing tube (52) is provided on the main drain 
probe (14). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 
8 to 13, characterised in that the mount (26) 

including the associated pivot drive (30) and 
optionally the drive rollers (44, 48) are mounted

of the main drain pipe (10) and which can be 

rotated about its axis relative to the main drain 
probe (14) by means of a drive motor (18). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 
8 to 14, characterised in that the main drain
