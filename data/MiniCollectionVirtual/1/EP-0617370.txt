<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods for facilitating and managing 
communications between individuals who are involved in a community of action or 
purpose. In one sense, aspects of the invention relate to such fields as 
electronic mail, word processing, data base management and other methods for 
facilitating the transaction of business between individuals and the management 
of data and communications related to such transactions. In another, more important sense, this invention is a pioneering one which 
establishes a new field of managing business, social and personal communications 
by integrating state of the art computer and communication tools and 
methodologies within a new conceptual and methodological framework: managing 
communications by treating them as moves in conversations in a structured 
context which encourages participants to carry out their communications in a  
 
more meaningful, organized manner and promotes completion of conversations to 
the satisfaction of all of their participants. This invention is based on the development of a precise and rigorous language 
of distinctions which is valid for observation and interpretation of what is 
happening in the whole gamut of human conversation and simultaneously forms 
the basis for a method for supporting, enhancing, and coordinating human 
conversation which can be carried out in a variety of computer and 
communication system environments. The earliest tools for generating utterances, including both spoken and written 
manifestations of language, were writing implements, from the quill to the 
typewriter, to the modem word processor. None of these devices operate in 
accord with what one speakers do in language, that is, with what speakers 
expect or hope to accomplish with their utterances. They deal only with the 
form of utterances, as sequences of letters, figures, typographical marks, etc. 
There is no communication management, no helpful machine/human interaction 
which facilitates accomplishment of the purposes and goals of the 
communications being prepared.  Many devices have been invented for transmitting visible sequences of marks or 
audible sounds from one place to another, from the postal service to telephony, 
facsimile, and more recently, electronic mail systems. A person who composes an utterance does so within a certain background of 
understanding as to what is being done. In the current prevalent practice in 
electronic mail, the relevant structure is the identification of sender and 
receiver and the

<CLAIMS>
The machine-implemented method for managing business, social, and/or personal 
communications in which a communication among a set of participants is treated 

as a move in one of a first type of conversation for declaring specific 
realizable possibilities and a second type of conversation for producing action 

to complete a specific declared possibility, said method utilizing a computer 
system including a user input/output interface and a record storage system and 

being based on 
   a predefined set of conversational roles played by participants in said 

conversations, with each participant playing at least one conversational 
role in any one of said conversations; 

   a preselected set of types of incompletions which occur recurringly 
within said conversations, including a first type in which a 

conversational move by at least one participant to declare at least one 
specific realizable possibility is missing, and a second type in which a 

conversational move by at least one participant to complete a specific 
realizable possibility is missing; 

   a set of types of permitted moves for each of said first type of 
conversation and said second type of conversation, including at least 

one predefined initial type of move and subsequent types of moves 
preselected on the basis of a functional relationship among said types 

of incompletions, said conversational roles, and a specific subset of 
 

said types of incompletions produced by each of said initial and 
subsequent types of moves; 

   a preselected set of associated data for each of said initial and 
subsequent types of moves; 

   a predefined conversation record format for each of said conversations 
comprising identities and roles of participants, incompletions, and a 

pre-defined body of data associated with each move in the conversation, 
including the type of move; 

said method comprising the steps of:

device a selection menu comprising menu elements for selecting one of Task 1 

comprising opening a new conversation of one of said first type and second type,

subsequent type of move, and Task 3 comprising reviewing one of all initial 
types of moves and subsequent types of moves by other participants in all 

converstions in which said one participant plays one of said conversational 
roles;
