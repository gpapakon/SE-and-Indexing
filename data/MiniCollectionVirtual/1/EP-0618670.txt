<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a low-noise alternating-current generator having an alternator (1) which is driven by a motor (4) and has a reversible-pole magnet system, and having a device (3) for reversing the poles of the magnet system in such a manner that the frequency of the generator voltage produced remains essentially constant, a mains monitor being provided in order to detect the magnitude of an overall load (10) applied to the generator, an actuating element (6) being provided which is acted on by the mains monitor and by means of which the rotation speed of the motor (4) can be changed as a function of the detected overall load (10), the value at which the overall load is changed over being subject to hysteresis, and a switch being provided for automatic disconnection and reconnection of the overall load on reaching the predetermined changeover value for a time interval used for rotation-speed matching.

Device for generating alternating current, having an 
alternating current generator (1) with a pole-changing 

magnet system driven by an engine (4), as well as a 
device (3) for changing the poles (60 to 63) of the 

magnet system so that the frequency of the generator 
voltage which is produced remains substantially constant, 


characterised by
 a mains monitor (7) to detect the 
magnitude of a total load (10) applied to the generator 

(1), a final controlling element (6), which receives a 
signal from the mains monitor (7) and with which the 

speed of the engine can be varied in accordance with the 
detected total load (10), whereby the final controlling 

element (6) changes to the higher speed when the total 
load (10) exceeds an upper switching value (A) and 

changes to the lower speed when the total load falls 
below a lower switching value (B), a switching hysteresis 

being achieved, and a switch is provided for 
automatically isolating and reconnecting the total load 

(10) for the period of the speed adjustment when the 
predetermined switching value (A, B) is reached.

Claim 1, characterised in that the generator of the 

device for generating alternating current is a 
synchronous generator, in particular, constructed as a 

single-phase type, preferably as an inner pole generator,
