<ABSTRACT>
A clutch pedal dashpot (10) for controlling 
the rate torque is applied to a vehicular driveline 

during the coupling of an engine to a transmission by 
controlling the rate at which the clutch engages via 

damping clutch pedal travel. The dashpot is for use in 
a vehicle, such as a heavy-duty truck, which includes a 

clutch pedal (20) displaced between a resting position 
and a depressed position. The clutch pedal dashpot 

includes a damper piston (32), coupled to the clutch 
pedal (20), for controlling the rate at which the clutch 

pedal returns to the first position from the second 
position during coupling so as to control the rate of 

clutch engagement, thereby controlling the rate of 
torque applied to the driveline.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicular 
master clutches and, more particularly, to clutch 
dampers for limiting the application of torque to truck 
driveline components. Driveline component manufacturers, especially 
in the trucking industry, are continually being urged to 
improve the durability and reliability of driveline 
components, such as driveshafts, axles and gears. Since 
the best solution is not always merely one of "beefing 
up" the individual components, various damping devices 
have been conceived and are well-known in the art. 
clutch damping/torque limiting devices are illustrated 
in United States patent numbers 4,668,207, 4,693,354, 
4,888,539, 4,947,972 and 5,009,301. Other clutch activating systems and methods may 
been seen by reference to United States Patent Numbers 
5,127,506; 5,009,299; and 4,779,713. Similarly, European 
Patent Numbers 0097594 and 0399399 illustrate systems 
which assist in the application of a vehicle clutch. 
Deutsch Patent 2440039 and UK Patent 2125135 disclose 
systems for assisting and/or controlling application of a 
vehicle clutch. However, none of these systems or methods 
include the inventive features of the present invention as 
described herein.  
 One problem of particular significance results 
when a truck driver overzealously engages the clutch by, 
for example, "side-stepping" the clutch. When a driver 
side-steps, the clutch pedal is depressed and a 
particular gear is selected. The engine is then revved 
up and the driver slides his foot sideways off of the 
clutch pedal, allowing the clutch pedal to snap back to 
the resting position. This results in a very rapid 
clutch engagement and application of torque to the 
driveline, inducing vibrations and oscillations into the  
 
driveline. The driveline components are seriously 
stressed and failure is hastened if the rate of torque 
application is faster than the natural frequency of the 
driveline. Specifically, unnecessary stress occurs when 
the driveline torque input has major harmonic content at 
frequencies at or above the lowest natural frequency of 
the driveline. Thus, if the rate of torque application 
is at or below the natural frequency, the driveline is 
not shocked. It is therefore desirable to prevent 
overzealous engagement of a clutch by controlling the 
rate of torque applied to the driveline in a reliable, 
durable and cost-effective way. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a system for preventing overzealous engagement 
of a clutch by controlling the rate

A clutch pedal dashpot (12) for use in a vehicle 
including a clutch pedal (20) and a clutch mechanism for 

coupling an engine to a driveline, the clutch pedal being 
displaced between a first position and a second position, the 

clutch pedal dashpot for controlling the rate of torque 
applied to the driveline during coupling, the clutch pedal 

dashpot including a housing (30), a damper piston (32) 
disposed within the housing (30) and coupled to the clutch 

pedal (20) for controlling the rate at which the clutch pedal 
returns to the first position from the second position during 

coupling so as to control the rate of clutch engagement, 
thereby controlling the rate of torque applied to the 

driveline, the clutch pedal dashpot being characterized by: 

a damper piston stop member (50) disposed within 
and fixedly attached to the housing (30), the stop member 

limiting travel of the damper piston within the housing to 
affect coupling of the damper piston to only a portion of the 

possible travel of the clutch pedal from the first position 
to the second position; and 
bias means (38), disposed between the housing and 
the damper piston, for biasing the damper piston toward the 

stop member during displacement of the clutch pedal from the 
first position to the second position; 
the damper piston sealingly cooperating with the 
housing to create a chamber (42), the clutch pedal dashpot 

including valve means (40) for allowing air to be drawn into 
the chamber as the pedal is displaced from the first position 

to the second position and impeding air from being expelled 
from the chamber as the pedal is displaced from the second 

position to the first position. 
The clutch pedal dashpot of claim 1 wherein the 
damper piston (32) is displaced from a rest position to a 

reset position at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the 
damper piston returns to the rest position, as the clutch 

pedal is displaced between the first position and the second 
position.  

 
The clutch pedal dashpot of claim 1 wherein the 
valve means (40) includes a one-way check valve which impedes 

air from being expelled from the chamber (42) the clutch 
pedal dashpot being further characterized by a passage (44) 

for allowing air to be drawn into and expelled from the 
chamber at different rates as the pedal is displaced from the 

second position to the first position. 
The clutch pedal dashpot of claim 3 wherein the 
one-way check valve (40) and the passage are arranged such 

that air enters the chamber (42)at a rate which exceeds the 
rate at which air is expelled from the chamber so as to allow 

the damper piston to be quickly reset to the damper piston 
stop member as the clutch pedal is displaced to the second 

position.  
 
A method for controlling the rate of torque 
applied to a driveline in a vehicle including a clutch pedal 

(20) and a clutch mechanism for coupling an engine to the 
driveline where the clutch pedal (20) is displaced between a 

first position and a second position, the clutch mechanism 
having a housing (30) including a one-way check valve (40) 

and a passage (44) for allowing air to be drawn into and 
expelled from the housing (30) at different rates as the 

clutch pedal (20) is displaced between the first position and 
the second position, the clutch mechanism also including a 

damper piston (32) disposed within the housing (30), the 
damper piston (32) being coupled to the clutch pedal (20) and 

axially displaced within the housing (30) during a portion of 
the displacement of the clutch pedal (20) between the first 

and second positions, the portion of the displacement being 
determined by a damper piston stop member (50) disposed 

within the housing (30), the method characterized by:
 
   limiting the rate of axial movement of the damper 

piston (32) during the portion of the displacement of the 
clutch pedal (20) between the second position and the first 

position so as to control the rate of clutch engagement and 
the rate torque is applied to the driveline. 
The method of claim 5 wherein the step of 
limiting the rate of axial movement includes limiting the 

rate which air is expelled from the housing (30) through the 
passage (44).  

 
The method of claim 5 wherein the step of 
providing a housing includes the step of arranging the one-way 

check valve (40) and the passage (44) so as to allow the 
damper piston to be displaced from a rest position to a reset 

position at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the damper 
piston returns to the rest position, as the clutch pedal is 

displaced between the first position and the second position.
