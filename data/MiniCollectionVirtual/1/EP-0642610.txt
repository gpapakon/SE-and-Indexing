<ABSTRACT>
The removal of bleaching chemical-consuming metals from treatment fluids in a cellulose pulp mill is facilitated by treating the pulp in an acidic or neutral stage to dissolve metals, washing or thickening the pulp to produce a filtrate containing dissolved metals, and then using an alkali liquid to adjust the pH of the filtrate to cause dissolved metals to precipitate. The alkali liquid is pretreated with carbon dioxide to reduce the sulfide content and increase the carbonate content thereof, preferred alkali liquids being green liquor and white liquor. The reduced-metal content filtrate is used in the bleach plant of the pulp mill, to make bleaching chemicals, as a wash liquid, etc. Treatment of the alkali liquid with carbon dioxide is typically practised dy scrubbing the liquor with carbon dioxide gas, for example, using a plate column scrubber or a stationary packing scrubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method for
minimizing adverse environmental impact of the production of kraft pulp, or
the like, by bleaching the pulp without chlorine or chlorine-containing liquids,
and removing metals (such as Mn, Fe and Cu) to prevent buildup of those
metals to a level adversely affecting the bleaching reactions.WO 93/23607 being a
document only citable under Article 54(3),(4) EPC for novelty
discloses a process for bleaching pulp which has been digested
and oxygen-delignified, using methods which preserve viscosity
and strength without using chlorine-containing chemicals and
employing a bleaching sequence containing at least three
bleaching stages. The first three stages are QPZ, wherein Q is
a chelation stage. The effluent from this Q stage contains metal
ions and organic material. This effluent can be introduced, with
or without concentration, to the recovery system. One suggested
location for introducing the effluent is to smelt dissolution to
form green liquor. Thus, the process disclosed in WO 93/23607
is not different from conventional recovery processes in which
some form of liquid is used to dissolve the recovery boiler
smelt to produce green liquor. This green liquor is then
clarified to remove undesirable "green liquor dregs", which
typically contain precipitated metals. However, this is in no
way, shape, or form an adjustment of the pH of the effluent to
precipitate metals and produce a re-useable source of liquid.
The effluent of WO 93/23607 is simply introduced to the
cooking liquor cycle and essentially lost for any type of re-use
as a metal-depleted liquor. Accordingly, some other source of
metal-depleted liquid must be provided when needed.WO 94/12720 also being
a document only citable under Article 54(3),(4) EPC for novelty
discloses a process substantially identical to the process of
WO 93/23607. WO 94/01615 being a
document only citable under Article 54(3),(4) EPC for novelty
discloses a process for bleaching pulp in conjunction with
adsorption of metals, specially the handling of metal ions in
bleach plant effluents. This process isolates the metals and
then reintroduces them at a point in the fiber line in which
metal ions are supposedly benign. Though some metal-depleted
filtrate is theoretically produced, the disclosure of this
document assumes that the reintroduction of a filtrate stream
containing dissolved metals and dissolved organics, including
dissolved lignite, to a bleached or unbleached pulp stream will
not degrade the quality of the pulp or

<CLAIMS>
A method of removing transition metals from treatment
fluids in a cellulose pulp mill, comprising the steps of

continuously:

(a) treating digested pulp in an acidic or neutral
stage to dissolve transition metals; and
(b) washing the pulp after step (a) to produce a filtrate
containing dissolved transition metals;

   
characterized by
(c) adjusting the pH of at least a substantial part of the
filtrate from step (b) so that it is greater than 9, while

providing a filtrate carbonate content of at least about
0.01 mole/l., to cause dissolved transition metals in the

filtrate to precipitate as solids in the pH adjusted filtrate;
(d) filtering the solids containing transition metals from
the pH adjusted filtrate of step (c) to produce a greatly

reduced transition metal content filtrate; and
(e) using the greatly reduced transition metal content
filtrate elsewhere in the pulp mill.
A method as recited in claim 1 further characterized in
that step (c) is practiced by adding a material selected from

the group consisting essentially of lime, lime milk, lime mud,
slaker grits, alkaline bleach plant effluent, white liquor,

green liquor, and mixtures thereof.
A method as recited in claim 1 or 2 further characterized
in that step (c) is further practiced by adding carbonate ion so

that the filtrate has a carbonate level of approximately
0.05 mole/l.
A method as recited in any preceding claim further
characterized in that the carbonate source is selected from the

group consisting essentially of CO
2
, white liquor, and green
liquor.
A method as recited in any preceding claim further
characterized in that step (c) is practiced so as to adjust the

pH to greater than 10.5.
