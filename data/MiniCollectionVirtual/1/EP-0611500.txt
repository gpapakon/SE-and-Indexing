<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed satellite communication system comprises a dynamic constellation (C) of satellites (S). The system includes a number of low-earth orbiting spacecraft (S) which travel in orbital planes. Each of the individual spacecraft (S) functions as an independent sovereign switch which knows the position of its neighbors, and independently handles traffic without ground control. The satellites (S) are capable of transporting calls directly to users of portable, mobile and fixed radio terminals; and via gateways to users of the public switched telephone network. The present invention offers direct communication between satellites (S) of the constellation (C) and individuals using lightweight, portable telephones. The direct link is made possible by miniature antennas (210) coupled to the handheld phones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of satellite communications. More particularly, this
invention comprises a dynamic geodesic constellation of 840 autonomous satellites in low Earth orbit.
Each satellite in the distributed, non-hierarchical constellation is an equally important node in the
network, possesses independent switching intelligence and is capable of communicating directly with a
broad variety of subscribers using portable, mobile and fixed terminals. The system will provide
continuous world-wide service for voice, data and video signals. This novel satellite network has the ability
to bypass traditional land-based networks and will offer a revolutionary expansion of global
communications potential.Public telephone systems have generally used the same system architecture for over one hundred
years. Conventional systems employ highly centralized and hierarchical switching facilities as nodes that
tie together a complex web of connected links. While a very small portion of their subscribers use direct
links to geostationary satellites, the vast majority of the links that couple the conventional phone network
comprise a bewildering and dissimilar assortment of cables, wires, fibers and microwave repeaters. Like
all hierarchical systems, conventional telephone networks are extremely vulnerable when the performance
of any high-ranking node in the hierarchy is impaired. For example, a fire in a Hinsdale, Illinois wire
center denied long-distance service to the Chicago area for several days. Relatively minor software
failures can disrupt or even suspend service in large, densely-populated urban areas. This vulnerability
to localized failure is compounded by the limits which a centralized architecture imposes on the expansion
potential of the network. On average, every time a new subscriber is added to a conventional land-based
communication network, expensive additions to switching hardware and connecting wires must be installed.
The marginal cost of adding each new subscriber is extremely high, and the cost of raising that capital is
a drain on telephone subscribers and on the economy at large. Conventional telephone systems are
inherently circumscribed by their hierarchical design, and these limits now impose critical barriers to the
enormous augmentation of capacity which the previous networks must provide to meet the burgeoning
world demand for communications services in the coming decades.Several attempts to bypass these inherent limits have met with mixed results. Large consumers

A communications system for conveying communication signals from several
sending terminals (10, P, M, F, G) at geographically diverse sending locations on the earth to

several receiving terminals (12, P, M, F, G) at geographically diverse receiving locations on
the earth comprising a multiplicity of satellites (S) each in a low earth orbit

such that the satellites (S) are in constant motion over the face of the earth, the satellites (S)
having means (700, 702) for receiving communication signals from earth-based

sending terminals (10, P, M, F, G) and means (700, 702) for transmitting received
communication signals to earth-based receiving terminals (12, P, M, F, G), the satellites (S)

terminal (12, P, M, F, G) thereby establishing a communication link between the sending
terminal and the receiving terminal, the receiving/transmitting means including
