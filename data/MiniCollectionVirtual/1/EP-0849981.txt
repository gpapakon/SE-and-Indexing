<ABSTRACT>
A double-sided or multilayer copper clad circuit board (1), having a Pb-Sn layer (4, 5) on the copper cladding, has a cooling plate (6) with a copper surface which has been coated with a silver layer (8) prior to soldering onto one side of the board (1). Preferably, the cooling plate (6) is a copper plate or a silver-coated copper clad plastic plate with heat dissipation holes which may be copper metallised or filled with thermally conductive paste. Also claimed is a process for producing the above circuit board by providing the copper surface of a cooling plate (6) with a silver layer (8), placing the silver layer side of the cooling plate (6) on the circuit board (1) and pressing the cooling plate (6) onto the board using a heated pressure plate (20), preferably while cooling the opposite side of the board.
