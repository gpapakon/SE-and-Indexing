<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a bed 
construction (1), with a movable netting panel (3), for 

preventing bed-sores from forming, comprising a 
bearing framework (2), to which there is connected a 

netting panel (3), including a central portion (4) and, 
on the two sides (5,6) thereof, side portions (5,6) pivoted 

along longitudinal axes. 
The bed construction (1) is characterized in 
that it comprises height setting elements (10,11) operating 

on spaced points of the central portion (4) in 
order to change the laying plane. 
Sliding rollers (20) are moreover provided, 
supported by the longitudinal members (21) of the 

framework (2) and engaging with cross tracks (22) arranged 
at the side portions (5,6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bed 
construction, including a movable netting panel, 
for preventing bed-sores from occurring. As is known, a very important problem related 
to patients restrained for long times in a 
bed, is that of the bed-sores, which are formed 
on those regions of the patient body which are 
pressed for a long period of time, by the weight 
of the body itself, against the bed mattress. In order to solve the above problem, there 
have been already designed bed constructions, in 
which the netting panel comprises three elements, 
which are mutually pivoted along longitudinal 
axes, comprising a central portion, 
coupled to complex driving systems, adapted to 
change the slanted attitude thereof, as well as 
side portions which, on a side, are pivoted to 
the central portion and, on the opposite side, 
are pivoted to connecting rods coupled to the 
bed framework. This approach, however, is not satisfactory 
since it does not allow to obtain a proper 
displacement of the side portions and, moreover, 
originates great difficulties in making the bed.  Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, 
by providing a bed construction, including 
a movable netting panel, for preventing bedsores 
from occurring, which affords the possibility 
of easily displacing the bed side portions, 
by construction wise simple elements, 
which, in operation, cause the side portions to 
forcibly assume the desired slanted attitude. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is 
to provide such a bed construction which is very 
safe and reliable in operation and which, moreover, 
allows to obtain a programmed handling or 
displacement so as to allow to change, at preset 
times,the position of the patient. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a bed construction, including 
a movable netting panel, which can be 
easily made starting from easily commercially 
available elements and materials and which, 
moreover, is very competitive from a mere economic 
standpoint. According to one aspect of the present invention,  
 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become 
more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a bed 
construction, including a movable netting panel, 
for preventing bed-sores from occurring, comprising 
a bearing framework, to which is connected 
a netting panel, including a central portion 
and, on the two sides thereof, side portions 
pivoted

<CLAIMS>
A bed construction, including a movable 
netting panel, for preventing bed-sores from occurring, 

comprising a bearing framework, to 
which is connected a netting panel, including a 

central portion and, on the two sides thereof, 
side portions pivoted along longitudinal axes, 

and characterized in that said bed construction further 
comprises height setting elements operating 

on spaced points of said central portion in 
order to change its laying plane, sliding rollers 

being furthermore provided supported by 
longitudinal members of said framework and engaging 

with cross tracks arranged at said side 
portions. 
A bed construction, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said height setting elements 

comprise driving elements operating on two 
points of said central portion, and which are 

mutually spaced in the width direction. 
A bed construction, according to Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the first of said driving 

element is coupled to said central portion, 
near the pivoting region to one of said side 

portions, whereas the second of said driving elements 
 

engages with an intermediate part of said 
central portion. 
A bed construction, according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said driving elements can be actuated according 
to a program.
