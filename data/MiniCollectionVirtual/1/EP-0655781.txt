<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing a wafer containing microelectronic mechanical 
devices that allows all fabrication and test steps to be performed in wafer 

form instead of device form. The wafer 20 is mounted in a saw frame 24 on 
dicing tape 22 and the individual devices 27 separated, typically by sawing, 

prior to completing device fabrication. The devices are left on the dicing tape 
during the remaining fabrication steps. Some fabrication steps may require 

covering the adhesive of the dicing tape with a protective cover 44. After all 
fabrication steps including the application of a protective overcoat and 

functional testing are completed, the devices are removed from the dicing 
tape and packaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of integrated circuit processing, more 
particularly to microelectronic mechanical device fabrication, including 
deformable micromirror devices. In order for integrated circuit (IC) processing to be cost effective, the 
individual circuits, or devices, are typically mass produced using a 
semiconductor wafer to make many devices on a single substrate 
simultaneously. A typical process flow for integrated circuits follows the 
steps of device fabrication, device testing, device separation, and device 
packaging. When the devices are separated from a wafer, dicing debris, 
comprised of wafer particles and dust, is created. This dicing debris is 
washed from the surface of the IC prior to bonding the device to the package. Microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS), or micromechanical 
devices, often have structures that are too fragile to survive exposure to some 
of the standard IC fabrication steps such as device separation and cleanup. 
The fragile nature of some MEMS, for example the digital micromirror device 
(DMD) and some accelerometers, requires that the standard IC process steps 
be reordered to avoid damaging the completed devices. DMDs are explained 
in U.S. Patent No. 5,061,049, "Spatial Light Modulator and Method", which 
is assigned to Texas Instruments Incorporated. Accelerometers are described 
in U.S. Patent Serial No. 07/883,616, "Digital Accelerometer", which is also  
 
assigned to Texas Instruments Incorporated. As described in the 
aforementioned patents, these MEMS have very small structures suspended 
over an air gap above electrodes formed on the surface of a silicon substrate. 
Once these structures are formed and the sacrificial material is etched from 
the air gap, the devices are very fragile. The devices cannot be exposed to 
liquids, such as would occur during wafer cleanup steps, without risking 
destruction of the mirror. Therefore, the devices must be cut and the dicing 
debris washed away before etching the sacrificial material from underneath 
the mirror. Wafer separation prior to device completion results in extensive device 
handling during the remaining device fabrication steps such as passivation 
and device testing. Performing these processes in wafer form as opposed to 
device form greatly reduces the necessary handling because the processing 
equipment must only move and align to one wafer instead of many devices. 
Precise alignment is very critical for die testing. This invention discloses a method wherein the entire device
