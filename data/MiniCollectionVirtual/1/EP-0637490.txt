<ABSTRACT>
A measured-out quantity of a material which can be crosslinked by exposure to a suitable form of energy, in particular UV light (3), is introduced into a two-part mould (1), the cavity (15) of which defines the shape of a moulded part (CL) to be produced. The two mould halves (11, 12) are kept at a small distance from each other, so that there is formed between them a thin annular gap (16), which is in connection with the mould cavity (15) and through which excess material can escape. The crosslinkage is initiated by exposure to the chosen form of energy, exposure being spatially limited to the cavity (15) by suitable masking (21), so that material outside the mould cavity is not crosslinked. In this way, moulded parts which do not require secondary finishing are obtained, and the mould is reusable. The process is suitable in particular, but not exclusively, for the production of contact lenses.
