<CLAIMS>
Oligonucleotide, selected from the salmolysinlike
DNA region, for the detection of

Enterobacteriaceae, characterized by a sequence
according to one of the formulae IIa to IIh and/or an

affiliated complementary sequence,
in which


X
1
 and X
2
,
in each case independently of each other, are
hydrogen or one to 20 additional nucleotides:


Oligonucleotide, characterized by a sequence
according to one of the formulae IIIa to IIIh, or by a

corresponding complementary sequence:

Use of an oligonucleotide according to one of
Claims 1-2 as a nucleic acid probe or as a primer for

the detection of Enterobacteriaceae, in particular of
bacteria of the genus Salmo
nella.
Use according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the detection is effected using a nucleic acid probe.
Use according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the detection is effected by means of nucleic acid

amplification, an oligonucleotide according to one of
Claims 1-2 being employed as a primer.
Method for the detection of Enterobacteriaceae,
in particular of bacteria of the genus Salmonella,

characterized in that an oligonucleotide according to
one of Claims 1-2 is used as a nucleic acid probe or as

a primer.
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the detection is effected using a nucleic acid

probe.
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the detection is effected by means of nucleic acid

amplification, an oligonucleotide according to one of
Claims 1-2 being employed as a primer.

in particular of bacteria of the genus

Salmonella, characterized in that the compilation contains
an oligonucleotide according to one of Claims 1-2

as a nucleic acid probe or as a primer.
Test compilation according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the detection is effected using a

nucleic acid probe. 
Test compilation according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the detection is effected by means

of nucleic acid amplification, an oligonucleotide
according to one of Claims 1-2 being employed as a

primer.
