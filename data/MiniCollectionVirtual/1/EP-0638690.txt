<ABSTRACT>
When an engine (1) is in a driven state, a control 
device (25) outputs an opening driving signal so as to put 

an on-off valve (23) in an open state, and when operation 
levers (68 and so forth) are operated, the pressure oil of 

an auxiliary hydraulic pump (7) is supplied to the driving 
portions of switching valves (8-16) via a pressure reducing 

valve for switching. This regulates the flow rate and 
direction of the pressure oil from main hydraulic pumps 

(3, 4) and actuators (57A, 57B, 57C, 56A, 54) can be 
operated at a speed corresponding to the amount of the 

operation. When driving the actuators (57A, 57B, 57C, 
56A, 54) while the engine (1) is in a non-driven state 

and if an opening command is selected by means of a 
selection command device (24), the contr
ol device (25) 
outputs an opening driving signal to cause the on-off valve 

(23) to open a pipe line connecting an accumulator (21) 
and a pressure reducing valve (17) and so forth, whereby 

when, for instance, the operation lever (68) is operated, 
the switching valve (9) is switched, and the boom cylinder 

(57A) is activated by the weight of a working machine, 
thereby making it possible to lower the working machine. 

In contrast, in a case where the actuators (57A, 57B, 
57C, 56A, 54) are not driven with the engine (1) in a 

halt state and if a closing command is selected with the 
selection command device (24), the control device (25) 

outputs a closing driving signal to cause the on-off valve 
(23) to close the pipe line connecting the accumulator 

(21) to the pressure reducing valve (17). Even if the 
operation lever (68) or the like is accidentally operated, the 

actuators (57A, 57B, 57C, 56A, 54) will not operate, and 
therefore the working machine will not lower, whereby 

any operation against the operator's intention can securely 
be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic drive
system mounted on construction machines such as hydraulic
excavators.A conventionally known hydraulic drive system for
hydraulic excavators comprises a prime mover, a main hydraulic
pump driven by the prime mover, actuators such as a
travel motor, a swing motor, a boom cylinder, an arm cylinder
and a bucket cylinder which are driven by a hydraulic
fluid delivered from the main hydraulic pump, directional
control valves for controlling respective flows of the
hydraulic fluid supplied from the main hydraulic pump to
the actuators, an auxiliary hydraulic pump driven by the
prime mover, and control valve operating means for controlling
a hydraulic fluid delivered from the auxiliary hydraulic
pump to operate the directional control valves.In a hydraulic drive system for large-sized hydraulic
excavators, it is known to dispose, in addition to the
above arrangement, accumulator means or an accumulator in a
line branched from a line interconnecting the auxiliary
hydraulic pump and the control valve operating means, as
disclosed in JP, A, 4-30038, for example. With this arrangement, 
if any control valve operating means is operated
as occasion requires even after stop of the prime mover,
the hydraulic fluid from the accumulator serves as a hydraulic
source to shift the corresponding directional
control valve for driving the corresponding actuator.Specifically, the above accumulator is utilized, for
example, when the corresponding actuator should be driven
to operate a working unit which is left suspended in midair
upon the prime mover being stopped due to a failure, for
descending the working unit down to the ground by its own
dead load, or when the directional control valve should be
shifted to introduce the hydraulic fluid, which is left in
the line connected to the corresponding actuator, to a low-pressure
circuit for pressure release before front attachments
such as an arm and a boom are disassembled for the
purpose of displacement or transportation.In the above-described prior art, however, if an
operator or any other person touches the control valve
operating means by a mistake after stop of the prime mover,
the hydraulic fluid from the accumulator may be supplied to
a driving sector of the corresponding directional control
valve to shift the same such that the corresponding actuator
is brought into an operable state. This results in a
disadvantage that the actuator may be operated against the
intention of an operator, e.g., that the working unit left 
susp
