<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic box comprising a nozzle (16), made as one moulding. The nozzle (16) includes, at its end (20), a retention member (22) formed radially on the outside, and a recess (24) formed radially on the inside. The nozzle furthermore comprises stiffening ribs (26) which are integrally moulded with it and extend axially on the inside, at least partly in the region of the recess (24), in order to limit radial distortion of the nozzle when forcibly demoulding it. Applications in particular to heat-exchanger fluid boxes (coolant tanks) in motor vehicles.
