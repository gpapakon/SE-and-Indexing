<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for loading dough into a container through a container opening includes a support frame (12) having a cam rail (14). An endless band (16) is rotatable on the support frame (12) and includes a plurality of tilting spoon assemblies (20) mounted to the band (16). Each tilting spoon assembly (20) includes a support member (21), a spoon (26), a hinge (27), and a push bar (74). The hinge (27) joins an end (26B) of the spoon (26) to the support member (21). The push bar (74) selectively tilts the spoon (26) from a first position to a second position relative to the support member (21). The push bar (74) has a first end joined to the spoon (26), positioned between the hinge (27) and a second end (26A) of the spoon (26) remote from the first end (26B). A second end of the push bar engages the cam rail (14). The cam rail (14) includes bends to cause selective displacement of the push bar (74) to tilt the spoon (26) from the first position to the second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to continuous
dough processing lines. More particularly, the present
invention relates to an apparatus for inserting or
packing dough into containers.Apparatuses for inserting dough into
containers are generally known. United States Patent
No. 3,458,970 to Reid, et al., discloses one such
packing apparatus. The dough packing apparatus of Reid,
et al., includes a mechanism for rolling and slitting a
dough sheet to form a plurality of longitudinally
aligned adjacent rolls of dough; and a receiving
mechanism for grouping the dough pieces, for example, in
pairs, and for providing a predetermined space in
between single pieces. In a form of the apparatus, the
receiving mechanism includes a pair of vertically spaced
endless conveyors with receiving cups on one side of the
edges of the lower conveyor for initially holding the
pieces. An upper conveyor is obliquely mounted and is
adapted to contact the upper surfaces of the pieces
located in the cups when they have reached a
predetermined position, and thereafter roll them to the
lower conveyor to the opposite edge thereof. From the
edge of the lower conveyor, the dough pieces fall to an
indexing drum which, in turn, retains them for a
predetermined period of time and then transfers them to
one of several supporting and guiding spoons mounted on
an endless loading conveyor. A container dispenser
provides containers to the loading conveyor which
includes a provision for supporting the containers in
position to receive the rolls from the spoons. The spoons are arranged on the conveyor so as
to lie generally perpendicular to the conveying
direction. Specifically, fixed plates are mounted to
the endless conveyor along each edge. A hinge mounts a
supporting bracket to each of the plates. The
supporting bracket supports a spoon generally over each
respective plate. A container support is mounted to the
supporting bracket at a discharge end of the spoon. A
follower is secured to a free end of the supporting
bracket remote from the hinge. The follower engages a
stationary guide rail provided along the frame of the
dough packing apparatus. The stationary guide rail
includes bends such that its position varies with
respect to the support frame along the longitudinal
length of the support frame. The stationary guide rail
controls the position of the follower and, thus, the
support bracket attached thereto, so that as the
follower rises and falls following the guide rail, the
support bracket pivots on the hinge to tilt the spoon
between an

An apparatus for loading dough into a
container through a container opening, the apparatus

comprising:

a support frame (12);
a cam rail (14) mounted to the support frame;
an endless band (16) rotatable on the support
frame; and
a plurality of tilting spoon assemblies (20)
mounted to the band, each tilting spoon

assembly comprising:

a support member (21) fixed to the band;
a spoon (26) having a first end (26B) and a second
end (26A);
a hinge (27) proximate the first end (26B) and
joining the spoon to the support

member (21), and
a push bar (50, 74) having a spoon end (50B) joined to
the spoon (26) at a position between the

second end (26A) of the spoon and the
hinge (27), and a rail end (50A) engaging the

cam rail (14), the cam rail having bends
to cause selective displacement of

the push bar (50, 74) to tilt the spoon from
a first retracted position to a second tilted

position relative to the associated
support member (21).
An apparatus for loading dough into a
container through a container opening, the apparatus

comprising:

a support frame (12);
a cam rail (14) mounted to the support frame, the

cam rail comprising a first portion (80)
disposed on an upper section (82) of the

support frame (12) and a second portion (84)
disposed on a lower section (86);
an endless band (16) rotatable on the support
frame; and
a plurality of tilting spoon assemblies (20)
