<ABSTRACT>
A DRAM control circuit according to the present 
invention, comprising a DRAM, a DRAM controller adapted for 

receiving an address, write data, and a data rewrite 
command from a host controller and designating a row 

address and a column address to the DRAM, and a column 
address strobe signal control circuit, causes pseudo 

column address strobe signal DCASq-N to have "L" level to 
read the contents of the address when column address strobe 

signal DCAS-N and read signal RD-N have "L" level, causes 
pseudo column address strobe signal DCASq-N to have "H" 

level to set an input/output terminal I/O to high impedance 
when the read signal RD-N has "H" level, further causes 

pseudo write signal WR-q to have "L" level to output write 
data to a data bus when the input/output terminal I/O 

remains at the high impedance, and rewrites the contents of 
the address to the write data when the pseudo column 

address strobe signal DCASq-N is caused to have "L" level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DRAM (Dynamic
Random Access Memory) for performing a read modify write
process.Conventionally, a DRAM control circuit for
performing a read modify write process comprises a DRAM
controller and a DRAM. The DRAM controller receives an
address, write data, and data rewrite command from a
host controller. The DRAM controller designates a row
address and a column address to the DRAM. In addition,
the DRAM controller causes the signal levels of a row
address strobe signal, a column address strobe signal,
and a read signal to become "L". After the DRAM
controller reads the contents of the address through a
data bus, the DRAM controller causes the signal level of
the read signal to become "H" level and subsequently the
write signal to "L" level, then transmits write data to
the DRAM.On the other hand, when the signal levels of a row
address strobe terminal, a column address strobe
terminal, and an output enable terminal of the DRAM are
"L", the DRAM controller outputs the content of the
address designated from the input/output terminal to the
data bus. When the signal level of the read/write 
terminal is "L", the DRAM controller inputs the write
data to the DRAM through the input/output terminal
through the data bus and rewrites the content of the
designated address with the write data.However, a commercial DRAM is designed so that the
output enable terminal is grounded. (Refer to
"HB56G51232 Series, Hitachi IC Memory Data Book 3",
Semiconductor Division, Hitachi Co., Ltd., 14-th
edition, pp. 922-924, 1992.Thus, in the DRAM control circuit, after a read
cycle, although a row address and a column address were
designated, the signal level of the output enable
terminal of the DRAM is "L". Thus, the data bus cannot
be switched for the data write operation. After the
read cycle, the DRAM controller causes the signal levels
of the row address strobe signal and the column address
strobe signal to become "L", designates the row address
and the column address to the DRAM, and causes the
signal level of the write signal to become "L", and
rewrites the content of the address of the DRAM with the
write data. Thus, the number of cycles of the read
modify write process becomes long.EP-A-0 503 375 discloses a memory device executing a
read-modify-write access in a single access cycle. However, this
memory uses the output enable input for this purposeAn object of the present invention is to provide a
DRAM control circuit for decreasing the number of bus
cycles for data rewrite operation so as
