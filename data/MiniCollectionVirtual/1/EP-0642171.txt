<ABSTRACT>
A lateral bipolar transistor (fig.5) is provided 
with an emitter (5) and a collector (5') of a first 

conductivity type and a base (3,4) of a second 
conductivity type, arranged in a lateral structure. The 

transistor includes a region (4) constituting part of the 
base (3,4), in contact with a remainder part (3) of the 

base and which is positioned between the emitter (5) and 
collector (5'), and has a narrower energy band gap than 

the remainder part (3) of the base (3,4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lateral bipolar
transistor.There is already known a lateral bipolar transistor
in which the current flows horizontally, namely along or
parallel to the surface of the substrate. Such lateral
bipolar transistor is widely used because of the
advantage that it can be easily compatible with a
vertical bipolar transistor in which the current flows
vertically, namely in the direction of depth of the
substrate. For example, a lateral bipolar transistor of
pnp structure can be loaded on a same substrate with a
vertical bipolar transistor of opposite npn structure.However, the conventional lateral bipolar transistor
has been associated with a drawback that the current
amplification factor hFE cannot be increased because of
the following reasons.This is due to facts that, because of a low emitter-collector
breakdown voltage resulting from symmetrical
arrangement of the emitter area and the collector area
in such lateral bipolar transistor, the base width is apt
to be influenced by the collector voltage resulting
eventually in so-called Early effect (spreading of
depletion layer), and that, because of wide internal
spreading of the current flowing from the emitter into
the base, the recombined current in the base area governs
the function and the increased base current reduces
significantly the current amplification factor hFE. The present invention is intended to provide a
semiconductor device of a structure capable of increasing
lateral bipolar transistor current amplification factor.A solution to this problem has been described by
R.L. Thornton et al : IEEE Transactions on Electron
Devices, 36, No.10 (1989), pages 2156-2164. A
heterojunction bipolar transistor with lateral current
flow is described therein having features defined by the
preamble of claim 1 appended hereto. In the structure
described therein the emitter, base and collector regions
have a common laminated heterostructure in which an
active portion of the base is a layer of GaAs. This
layer, which extends across the adjacent emitter and
collector regions is sandwiched between wider band gap
layers of AlGaAs. In forming the emitter and collector
regions, Si is diffused to produce a disordered structure
in the GaAs layer regions of the emitter and collector.
In this step Al diffuses into the emitter and collector
portions of the GaAs layer thus producing a graded
composition structure having a graded band gap
intermediate that of the remainder of the emitter and
collector regions and the base region portion of the
