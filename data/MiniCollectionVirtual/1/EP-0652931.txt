<ABSTRACT>
Described are detergent mixtures containing (a) quaternarized fatty-acid alkanolamine esters of formula (I), in which R1CO is an aliphatic acyl group with 6 to 22 carbon atoms and 0 or 1 double bonds, Z is an ethylene or isopropylene group, EO is a CH2CH2O- unit, (m+n+p) is a number from 1 to 10 and X is a halide, a methosulphate or an alkylphosphate anion, plus (b) other anionic, non-ionic and/or amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants. Such mixtures have a high foaming power, are easily concentrated and have a long shelf life.
