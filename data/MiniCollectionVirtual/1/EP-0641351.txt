<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with U.S. Government support under grant GM 38987 awarded by the U.S. 
National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention. This invention relates to a class of novel fluorogenic substrates for detecting enzyme activity, 
particularly that of glycosidase, phosphatase, and sulfatase enzymes. The enzyme acts on the appropriate 
substrate to yield fluorescent products that are specifically formed, nontoxic, and insoluble in aqueous systems. Detection of enzyme activity is useful in the analysis of a biological or chemical sample, such as 
whole organisms, cells or cell extracts, biological fluids, or chemical mixtures. For example, information 
about metabolism, disease state, the identity of microorganisms, the success of a genetic manipulation, or the 
quantity of toxins, can be gained from evaluating the activity of certain enzymes. Furthermore enzyme 
conjugates are often used as sensitive bioanalytical tools for detection of analytes. Enzyme activity is often detected through the use of a synthetic substrate. The endogenous substrates 
of an enzyme are used in designing synthetic substrates. Several glycosidase enzymes are known to target 
specific glycosides (R-O-Gly) to yield the corresponding carbohydrate and an organic alcohol or phenol (R-OH). 
Phosphatase enzymes catalyze the conversion of certain phosphate monoesters (R-O-P(O)(OH)2) to 
inorganic phosphate (Pi) and an organic alcohol (R-OH). Similarly, organic alcohols or phenols result when 
sulfatase enzymes liberate inorganic sulfate from some sulfate monoesters (R-O-SO3H) or when 
guanidinobenzoatase enzymes hydrolyze aryl esters of p-guanidinobenzoic acid (R-O-(C=O)-C6H4-NH- 
(C=NH)-NH2). Carboxylic acid esters (R-O-(C=O)-R') are hydrolyzed by esterase enzymes to alcohols and 
acids. Cytochrome enzymes oxidize aryl alkyl ethers to give the phenol and an aldehyde or acid. Most phosphatase and sulfatase enzymes are nonselective for the structure of the alcohol. Two types 
of phosphatase enzymes have been identified, however, that have different optimal pH for their enzymatic 
activity (pH optima about 10 and about 5 respectively). The aryl sulfatase enzyme most closely resembles the 
acid phosphatase in pH optimum and substrate turnover. Guanidinobenzoatase is a cell surface protease 
characteristic of several human tumor cell lines, which is not detectable in normal human cell strains. 
Esterases have structural requirements that range from those that hydrolyze esters of the lower
