<ABSTRACT>
To destroy bacteria, a liquid is first heated, in the case of water to above 80 DEG C. The liquid is then shaken in a vessel for about 2.5 minutes, which causes its oxygen content to increase again to a value existing before heating, but which was lost due to the heating. By means of this reversal of the decrease in oxygen content, the liquid reacquires its original properties apart from the absence of bacteria.

<CLAIMS>
Process for making water palatable and/or capable of preservation by heating the water
and then cooling it and treating it with oxygen in a container, characterized in that the

container is formed as a shaking container, contains air above the surface of the liquid for
treatment of the water with oxygen, and is shaken for about 2½ minutes to raise the oxygen

content of the water.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the water is heated to a temperature
of at least 80° and is cooled to around room temperature before shaking.
