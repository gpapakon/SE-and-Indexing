<ABSTRACT>
In a structure for fitting a plug-like connection member to a 
socket-like connection member, a plurality of longitudinal leaf springs 

are disposed at intervals on the inner wall of the recess of the socket-like 
connection memb
er. The minimum inner diameter defined by 
the leaf springs is made smaller than the outer diameter of the plug-like 

connection member. The present invention can be applied to the 
connection of a lamp as the plug to a socket.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the structure of a 
socket-shaped connector into which a plug-shaped 
connector is fitted for their connection, and to the 
structure of a socket in which an electric bulb to be 
held is fitted. In the conventional incandescent electric 
bulb, bulb-type fluorescent lamp and other various 
electric bulbs, the socket structure to hold and 
connect an electric bulb therewith is that as shown in 
Figure 15, while a female thread (c) is formed on the 
internal wall surface of the hollow part (b) of the 
socket (a), a male thread (f) is formed around the 
base (e) of an electric bulb (d), and this bulb's base 
(e) is screwed into the hollow part (b) of the socket 
(a), making an electrode (g) provided on the end of 
the bulb's base (e) contact a electrode (h) located at 
the most recessed part of the hollow part (b) of the 
socket (a), with the male thread (f) of the electric 
bulb base (e) used as the other electrode and the 
socket's female thread (c) as the other terminal. And 
the lead wires (i) and (j) are led out from terminals 
electrically connected with the electrode (h) and the 
female thread (c). However such a conventional method to connect 
an electric bulb with a socket was a screw-in method 
requiring a troublesome work to turn the electric bulb 
(d) several times by hand, after adjusting the male 
thread (f) around the bulb base (e) to the centre line 
of the female thread (c) in the hollow part (b) of the 
socket (a). Moreover this connection work has often 
to be done at a high position, where the worker has to 
fully stretch his arm upward for turning the electric 
bulb with his fingers into the socket. In this case 
there is danger that he may lose his bodily balance, 
fall onto the floor and be injured. The danger also  
 
attends when the worker unscrews the electric bulb 
from the socket. Such situations are not limited to the case of 
the electric bulb and its socket, but generally 
include the case where a conventional screw-in type 
connection body is screwed into a socket-shaped 
connector. In order to solve these problems, the object 
of this invention is to provide the socket structure 
to connect and hold an electric bulb which can provide 
very simple and highly strong connection, and more 
generally, the socket-shaped connectors' structure 
where the plug-shaped connector, including electric 
bulbs, are fitted in for the connection. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, in the structure to fit a plug-shaped 
connector in a
