It is characterised in that a holding device (30), connected to the side parts (1 to 6), is provided for attaching the multi-pack (20) to the erected side parts (1 to 6), the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) are divided into one or more side-part groups (A, B), the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) being connected to one another in an articulated manner in each of the side-part groups (A; B), and the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) being connected to one another in an articulated manner in one or more side-part groups (A, B) in such a way that one or more side parts (2, 3; 5, 6) of one or more side-part groups (A, B) can be pivoted outwards, away from the multi-pack (20), in such a way that the multi-pack (20) can be removed from the device (10) laterally or at an end face. A device is furthermore described for holding the multi-pack (20), the device (10) having a side part or a plurality of erectable side parts (1 to 6) which, erected outside the multi-pack (20), delimit a space for accommodating the multi-pack (20) and surround the multi-pack (20) or, erected inside the multi-pack (20), are arranged in such a way that they delimit the largest possible space inside the multi-pack (20) and are surrounded by the multi-pack (20), and having a holding device (30), connected to the side part or parts (1 to 6), for attaching the multi-pack (20) to the erected side part or parts (1 to 6). Further subjects of the invention are an appropriate method and packaging system.

Arrangement for retaining a low-rigidity collective
pack (20) for collecting and packaging reusable

packs for filter tow, the arrangement (10) having a
plurality of side parts (1 to 6), which can be stacked in

the upright position and, in the upright position,
delimit a space outside the collective pack (20) for the

purpose of accommodating the collective pack and enclose
the collective pack, and also having a retaining means

(30), which is connected to the side parts (1 to 6), for
fastening the collective pack (20) on the upright side

parts (1 to 6); characterized in that at least one of the
side parts can be swung outwards away from the collective

pack (20) such that the collective pack (20) can be
removed from the side or ends of the arrangement (10),

the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) being divided up into
one side-part group or a plurality of separate side-part

groups (A, B) with a releasable connection between them,
the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) in each of the side-part

groups (A; B) being connected to one another in an
articulated manner such that they can be swung round

towards one another, and the surfaces of the side parts
(1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) being located parallel to one another

once said side parts have been swung round, with the
result that the collapsed arrangement is no longer than

the longest of the side parts.
Arrangement for retaining a low-rigidity collective
pack (20) for collecting and pack
aging reusable
packs for filter tow, the arrangement (10) having a

plurality of side parts (1 to 6), which can be stacked in
the upright position and, in the upright position, 

delimit a space outside the collective pack (20) for the
purpose of accommodating the collective pack (20) and

enclose the collective pack (20) or, in the upright
position, are arranged inside the collective pack (20)

such that they delimit the largest possible space inside
the collective pack (20) and are enclosed by the collective

pack (20), and also having a retaining device (30),
which is connected to the side parts (1 to 6), for

fastening the collective pack (20) on the upright side
parts (1 to 6), the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) being

divided up into one side-part group or a plurality of
separate side-part groups (A, B) with a releasable

connection between them, the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4,
5) in each of the side-part groups (A, B) being connected

to one another in an articulated manner such that they
can be swung round towards one another, and the surfaces

of the side parts (1, 2, 6; 3, 4, 5) being located
parallel to one another once the side parts have been

swung round, with the result that the collapsed arrangement
is no longer than the longest of the side parts.
Arrangement for retaining a low-rigidity collective
pack (20) for collecting and packaging reusable
