<ABSTRACT>
A method of creating an image inside a transparent 
material with the aid of a pulsed laser beam involves as 

follows: use of a diffraction limited Q-switched laser, in 
particular, a solid-state single-mode TEM(subscript 

petit-00) laser; sharp focusing of the laser beam to provide 
an adjustable microdestruction in the material being 

treated; and mutual displacement of the laser beam and the 
material being treated after each laser shot to a next point 

of the image being reproduced. The microdestruction 
influenced upon the material at a pre-set point is 

adjustable in size by varying the actual aperture of the 
focusing lens and laser radiation power simultaneously. A 

device for carrying out said method comprises a laser 1, a 
defocusing lens 2 having a variable focal length, a focusing 

lens 4 capable of performing controlled motion along the 
laser beam 3 with the aid of an actuator 5, a drive 7 moving 

a specimen 6 made of a transparent material in a plane 
perpendicular to the laser beam 3, and a computer 8 guiding 

the process of specimen 6 treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to laser 
technology for treatment of transparent materials and more 
specifically to a method and apparatus for creating an image 
inside a transparent material, using a pulsed laser beam. Some methods and apparatus were previously known for 
creating a variety of images inside and on the surface of a 
transparent material, using a pulsed laser radiation emitted 
by a solid-state laser. One of such methods of image creation in a transparent 
material of the Plexiglas type is disclosed in US Patent 
No.4,092,518 of May 30, 1978, Int. Cl. B23K27/00 or Nat.Cl. 
219/121. The method is as follows: a cylindrical article made of 
a transparent material is placed with its flat edge towards 
the laser beam and the laser radiation having a pulse 
duration in the range of 100 to 300 (greek mu)s is focused 
inside the article using an optical lens. The effect of the laser pulse reveals in a number of 
three-dimensional macrodestructions appearing as fanned out 
cracks. A variety of such macrodestructions are produced in the 
article of a transparent material by changing the depth of 
laser beam focusing along the length of the article. The 
macrodestructions are shaped predominantly as saucers-like 
cracks of different size arranged randomly around the focal 
point thus establishing an optical decorative effect inside 
the transparent material.  Such a decorative effect is appreciably intensified 
when the said article is illuminated. Used as a device for practical realization of said 
method is a multimode solid-state free-running pulsed laser 
and a convergent lens having a focal length from 100 to 200 
mm for focusing laser radiation. Cylindrical articles of a 
transparent material having a diameter of 35 to 80 mm and a 
length of 85 to 205 mm are recommended for laser treatment. The said technology enables three-dimensional but 
uncontrolled and abstractly shaped images to be obtained, 
which produce a decorative effect. Moreover, the said technology fails to reproduce any 
desired image, accounting an uncontrolled behavior of 
macrodestructions occurring in the material being 
laser-treated. Another known method succeed in creating a pre-set 
image (e.g. image being copied by an optical camera) on the 
surface of a transparent material by a laser beam. In 
particular, US patent No.4,843,207 issued on June 27, 1989, 
IPC B23k26/00 or NPC 219/121 discloses a method and a device 
for producing, by a laser beam, a decorative ornament on 
products a transparent material and
