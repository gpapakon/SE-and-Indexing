<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to enhanced selectivity anion 
membrane electrodes useful in determining the amount of 

an anion of interest in a biological sample. The 
enhanced selectivity anion membrane formulation contains 

fumed silica, a polymer material, and an anion selective 
agent. The presence of fumed silica surprisingly 

minimizes or reduces the effect of interfering 
substances, such as salicylate which may be present in 

biological samples and which interfere with the 
determination of various anions of interest, such as 

chloride (Cl‚Åª).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chloride-selective
electrodes having membranes containing fumed silica.Electrochemical measurements are widely used to
determine the concentration of specific substances in
fluids. These devices, referred to as ion-selective
electrodes (ISEs), can be employed in a wide variety of
potentiometric ion determinations, including, for
example, the activity of fluoride ion in drinking water,
the pH of process streams, and the determination of
electrolytes in serum.In the health care field, and particularly in the
area of clinical diagnostics, ISEs are commonly used to
measure the activity or concentration of various ions and
metabolites present in blood plasma, serum and other
biological fluids. For example, ISEs are typically used
to determine Na+, Ca++, Mg++, K+, Cl-, Li+, pH, and
carbon dioxide content in such fluids.Conventional ion selective electrodes are typically
composed of an ion-selective membrane, an internal
filling solution or electrolyte, and an internal
reference electrode. Ion-selective electrodes can be
classified according to the nature of the membrane
material, and include solid state membrane electrodes,
glass membrane electrodes, liquid membrane electrodes
having charged ion-selective agents, and neutral liquid 
membrane electrodes having membranes formed from an
organic solution containing an electrically neutral, ion-selective
agent such as an ionophore held in an inert
polymer matrix. An external reference electrode used in
conjunction with the ISE is typically a metal/metal
halide electrode such as Ag/AgCl.An ion-selective electrode exposed or subjected to a
sample solution, such as a biological sample, and an
external reference electrode comprise a potentiometric
cell assembly. By selectively transferring the ion of
interest from the sample solution to the membrane, a
potential difference is generated. Under ideal
selectivity conditions of the membrane for the anion of
interest, the potential difference is a linear function
of the logarithm of the activity ratio of the ion of
interest in the two solutions contacting the membrane
(Nernst equation). A semi-empirical extension of the
Nernst Equation (Nikolskii Eisenmann equation) for EMF
may be utilized for non-ideal conditions. By "EMF" is
meant the electrical potential difference between the
internal ion sensing and external reference electrode,
the electrodes being electrolytically connected by means
of the sample solution at zero or near zero current flow.Conventional ISEs are typically bulky, expensive,
