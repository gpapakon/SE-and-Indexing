<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the need for manual work, improve 
productivity and reduce the fabrication cost in the 

method for molding a lead screw for converting a 
rotational movement into a linear movement, there are 

provided a method and a die assembly (23) which may involve 
the steps of forming a plurality of holes (5) in a wall of 

a tube (2) in a spiral arrangement, preparing a metallic 
die assembly provided with a cavity (b1) defining a thread 

groove adapted to form the thread crest matching in 
position with an array of the holes, placing the tube 

in the cavity, and injecting synthetic resin material 
into the cavity so that the synthetic resin material 

may flow in two separate flows, one flowing inside the 
core tube, and the other flowing along the outer 

surface of the core tube. The thread crest is 
connected to the synthetic resin material filled in the 

core tube, and can be securely attached to the core 

tube. Optionally, an annular rotor may be fitted onto 
the base end portion of the lead screw. The synthetic 

resin material is first filled into the annular gap 
defined around the annular rotor before it is filled 

into the interior of the annular rotor so that the 
rotor may be prevented from being damaged by the 

tensile stress produced by internal pressure acting on 
the annular rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
molding a lead screw with a core tube placed therein,
and in particular to a method for fabricating such a
lead screw in which the synthetic resin material
forming the thread crest is firmly attached to the core
tube, and a die assembly for fabricating such a lead
screw. The present invention also relates to a method
for integrally molding a lead screw having a core tube
therein and integrally provided with a rotor for an
electric motor at a base end portion thereof, and a die
assembly for fabricating such a lead screw.The lead screw fabricated by the method of the
present invention is particularly, but not exclusively,
suitable for use in mass data storage devices such as
flexible disk drives, hard disk drives, and optical
disk drives for moving a magnetic or optical head in
radial direction by converting the rotational movement
of an electric motor into a linear movement of the
magnetic or optical head.Conventionally, such a lead screw used to be made
by machining a screw thread in a metallic rod made of
such materials as bronze and stainless steel. A lead
screw made of such material has a high dimensional
precision and is durable, but is relatively expensive
to manufacture because of the various machining steps
involved. Furthermore, there is a substantial
difficulty in improving the efficiency of fabricating
such lead screws, and the cost of each lead screw is
therefore unacceptably expensive. In some
applications, generation of metal powder is desired to 
be avoided, and the use of synthetic resin material may
be preferred.There have been attempts to produce lead screws by
molding synthetic resin material, but such attempts
have encountered the following problems.Synthetic resin material can be readily molded
into a desired shape, but tends to involve shrinking
and cracking as well known in the art, and may warp and
otherwise deform in time depending on the environment.
Therefore, synthetic resin material cannot provide
sufficient reliability and precision that are required
in lead screws for converting a rotational movement
into a linear movement.In view of such problems, it has been proposed to
mold a desired screw thread on the outer wall of a
metallic tube with synthetic resin material, but
because the attachment between the screw thread and the
metallic tube cannot be made strong enough to entirely
prevent the separation between the tube and the screw
thread as required for the lead screw to perform its
function, this proposal has never achieved
