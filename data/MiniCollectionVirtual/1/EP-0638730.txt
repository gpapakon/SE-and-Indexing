<ABSTRACT>
A control means for a hydraulic motor connected to an 
external load comprises a directional valve (10) for 

selectively feeding hydraulic fluid to the motor from a 
pressure source and including load pressure sensing means 

(24, 25) connected to a load compensating valve (15) 
located upstream of the directional valve (10) for 

adjusting automatically the feed pressure in relation to 
the actual load pressure. The load compensating valve 

(15) includes a valve spindle (28) with opposite end 
surfaces (29, 30), one of which is exposed to the load 

pressure whereas the other is exposed to the feed 
pressure, and a selectively activatable feed pressure 

reducing means (38, 43; 50-57) for increasing the bias 
force acting on the load compensating valve spindle (28) 

in the closing direction of the latter in relation to the 
bias force acting in the closing direction of said valve 

spindle (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control means for a hydraulic motor
connected to an external load and which comprises a directional
valve for selectively feeding hydraulic fluid to the motor from a
pressure source.The directional valve is provided with a load sensing means which
is connected to a load compensating valve located upstream of the
directional valve and arranged to adjust automatically the feed
pressure in relation to the load pressure, which load pressure
compensating valve includes a valve spindle having oppositely
facing end surfaces, one of which is exposed to the load pressure
for biassing the valve spindle in the opening direction, whereas the
other end surface is exposed to the feed pressure for biassing the
valve spindle in the closing direction.The object of the invention is to accomplish an improved control
means of the above type by which it is possible to obtain a certain
degree of feed pressure reduction and, accordingly, a motor speed
reduction in case very heavy loads are to be handled by the motor,
loads that are heavier than what is allowed as maximum load for a
particular motor application. This is to avoid hazardous inertia
forces when moving a heavy object by means of the motor.A directional valve arrangement of the above type is previously
described in EP 0 377 544. This known device, however, comprises
two identical units connected to a common pump and having their
load sensing passages connected to the load sensing valve via an
"or"-element. This results in that the highest load pressure only is 
supplied to one of the compensating valve end surfaces for
accomplishing a feed
pressure reduction. Accordingly, the heaviest load dominates and
determines the pressure reduction as well as a speed reduction of
both loads. The purpose is to ensure that also the heaviest load will
be moved in case of an insufficient pump capacity. This device
solves a problem opposite to the problem described above, namely
to ensure movement of heavy loads.Another prior art hydraulic valve arrangement of the above
described type is shown in DE 42 30 183. This known device
includes two safety valves V1 and V2 which are intended to
connect the load pressure passage to tank, thereby stopping the
load movement in case of over-load. The valve V1 is an
automatically acting pressure controlled valve, whereas the valve
V2 is remotely controlled by an electromagnetic actuator. This
arrangement, however, does not offer any means for reducing the
load movement speed by increasing the pressure drop across the

Control means for a hydraulic motor connected to

an external load, comprising a directional valve (10)
having load pressure sensing means (24, 25) and arranged

to selectively feed hydraulic fluid to said motor from a
pressure source, and a load compensating valve (15)

located upstream of said directional valve (10) and
connected to said load pressure sensing means (24, 25)

and arranged to adjust the feed pressure in relation to
the actual load pressure and including a valve spindle

(28) having oppositely facing end surfaces (29, 30) one
(29) of which is exposed to the actual load pressure for

biassing said valve spindle (28) in the opening direction
of the latter, whereas the other (30) of said end

surfaces is exposed to the feed pressure for biassing
said valve spindle (28) in the closing direction of the

latter, 
characterized in
 that said load
compensating valve (15) comprises a selectively

activatable feed pressure reducing means (38, 43)
for increasing the bias force acting on said valve

spindle (28) in the closing direction of the latter in
relation to the bias force acting in the opening

direction of the said valve spindle (28).
Control means according to claim 1, wherein said
feed pressure reducing means (38, 43) comprises a spring

means (43) applicable on said valve spindle (28) in the
closing direction of the latter, and an actuating means

(40,41) shiftable between an inactive position in which it
inhibits the action of said spring means (43), and an

active position in which it applies said spring means 
(43) onto said valve spindle (28).
Control means according to claim 2, wherein said
actuating means (38) comprises a piston (38) which on its

one end is exposed to said feed pressure for being
biassed toward said inactive position, and which on its

opposite end is selectively pressurized for being
actuated toward said active position.
