<ABSTRACT>
A mounting device for a recessed ceiling lighting fixture (lamp, luminaire) is described, having a mounting bracket (1) for placement on a longitudinal ceiling support (11) and a mounting arm (2), which are connected to one another by means of a guiding device, the guiding device being a longitudinal guiding device with a large adjusting play, which acts perpendicularly with respect to the ceiling, can be set continuously and can be fixed and which has a coarsely set assembly position and a finely set installation position, and the longitudinal guiding device, which can be set continuously and which can be fixed, for the purpose of producing a self-locking action, being arranged such that the ceiling lighting fixture comes to rest on the mounting bracket (1) and is pivotable on the mounting arm (2). The mounting bracket (1) can in the simplest case interact directly with the lighting fixture housing, with the result that the mounting arm (2) can be dispensed with.

Retaining device for a built-in ceiling lamp,
having a retaining bracket (1) for mounting on a longitudinal

ceiling beam (11), and a retaining arm (2), the
retaining bracket and retaining arm being connected to

one another via a guide, the guide constituting an
infinitely adjustable and fixable longitudinal guide

which acts perpendicularly with respect to the ceiling,
has a large adjusting play and has a roughly adjusted

assembly position and a finely adjusted installation
position, characterized in that in the installation

position the ceiling lamp rests on the retaining bracket
(1), and in that in the preassembly position the retaining

bracket (1), together with the retaining arm (2), is
mounted pivotably.
Retaining device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the infinitely adjustable and fixable

longitudinal guide, for the purpose of producing self-locking,
is arranged such that the ceiling lamp rests on

the retaining bracket (1) and the retaining bracket (1)
can be pivoted on the retaining arm (2).
Retaining device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the infinitely adjustable and fixable

longitudinal guide is formed by an elongated hole (3) in
the retaining arm (2), through which hole an adjusting

screw engages through the retaining bracket (1), which
can be pivoted onto the longitudinal ceiling beam (11),

and the retaining bracket (1) is thus arranged displaceably
and fixedly in the elongated hole (3).
Retaining device according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the retaining arm (2) is fitted with one 

narrow side on the bottom of a lamp trough (7) and is
fastened with the other narrow side in the side wall (8)

of the lamp trough (7).
Retaining device according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the retaining arm (2) comprises an

angled sheet-metal strip which has an embossed fluted
portion (21).
Retaining device according to Claim 5, characterized
in that on a narrow side the retaining arm (16) has,

for fastening it to the lamp trough (7), a T-shaped
extension (17), opposite which, on the inside, are points

(19) which penetrate, during the fastening to the lamp
trough (7), into the material of the lamp trough (7) in

order to produce an earth contact, and on the other
narrow side of the retaining arm (16) there is a projection

(18) for fitting it to the bottom of the lamp
trough (17).
Retaining device according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the retaining bracket (30) is of U-shaped

design and has two arms (23, 24) which are parallel
to one another and are of identical design, and in

that the arms (23, 24) have holes (32) in which the legs
(33) of a spring (27) are mounted pivotably, the spring

(27) being supported with a point (31) on the retaining
arm (16) and pressing the latter against the webs (28,

29).
Retaining device according to Claim 7, characterized
in that, perpendicularly with respect to the longitudinal

direction of the arms (23, 24), said arms (23,
24) have elongated holes (25), that arm (23) which is to

be fitted on the ceiling beam (7) being bent away at the
elongated hole (25) through 90Â°.
Retaining device according to Claims 7 and 8,
characterized in that the arms (23, 24) are connected in

their central region by means of a U-base, the U-base
being formed by a recess (26) which is bounded by the

webs (28, 29) and through which the retaining arm (16)
engages non-positively with the webs (28, 29).
Retaining device for a built-in ceiling lamp, 
having a retaining bracket (49) for mounting on a longitudinal

ceiling beam (11), the retaining bracket (49)
being guided by slots (9) provided in the side wall (8)

of the lamp trough (7), the guide constituting an infinitely
adjustable and fixable longitudinal guide which

acts perpendicularly with respect to the ceiling, has a
large adjusting play and has a roughly adjusted assembly

position and a finely adjusted installation position,
characterized in that on each of its limbs the retaining

bracket (49) has knobs (50, 51) and a curved portion
(52), said retaining bracket thereby being held in its

preassembly position in the side wall (8) of the lamp
trough (7) in a self-locking manner.
Retaining device according to Claim 10, characterized
in that the retaining bracket (49) has tabs (53-55)

for guiding it in the slots (9).
Retaining device according to Claim 10 or 11,
characterized in that the slots (9) are of approximately

L-shaped design.
Retaining device according to one of Claims 9 to
12, characterized in that the retaining bracket (49) has

slots (59, 60) into which a spring (57) with tabs (56,
58) engages for the purpose of securing the position of

the retaining bracket (49) in its installation position.
