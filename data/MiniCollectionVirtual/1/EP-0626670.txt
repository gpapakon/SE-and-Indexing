<ABSTRACT>
Picture display device comprising a plurality of electron transport ducts 
for transporting the electrons in the form of electron currents, and selection electrodes 

for withdrawing each electron current at predetermined locations from its transport duct 
and for directing said current towards a luminescent screen. The selection electrodes are 

driven by a selection driver comprising a resistance ladder for supplying a bias 
(transport) voltage increasing with the position of the selection electrodes, and coupling 

capacitors for applying selection pulses to the selection electrodes. 
To enable the coupling capacitors to withstand voltages which are not too 
large, the selection driver comprises integrated driver circuits which are cascaded as 

regards their power supply voltages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a picture display device having a selection 
structure for controlling the passage of electrons via extraction locations which 
communicate row by row with electron transport ducts and with selection electrodes 
associated with the extraction locations, which selection electrodes are coupled to a 
selection driver comprising a resistance ladder for applying, to the selection electrodes, 
a bias voltage increasing with the position across the length of the transport ducts, and 
coupling capacitors for applying selection pulses to the selection electrodes. A picture display device of this type is described in European Patent 
Application no. 92204007.6 (PHN 13.963) and may comprise a display unit of the flat-panel 
type as disclosed in European Patent Applications EP-A 0 400 750 and EP-A 0 
436 997. Display units of the flat-panel type are constructions having a transparent face 
plate and, arranged at a small distance therefrom, a rear plate, which plates are 
interconnected by means of partitions and in which the inner side of the face plate is 
provided with pixels in the form of a phosphor pattern, one side of which is provided 
with an electrically conducting coating (the combination also being referred to as 
luminescent screen). If (video information-controlled) electrons impinge upon the 
luminescent screen, a visual image is formed which is visible via the front side of the 
face plate. The face plate may be flat, or if desired, curved (for example, spherical or 
cylindrical). The display unit described in European Patent Applications EP-A 0 400 
750 and EP-A 0 436 997 comprises a plurality of juxtaposed sources for emitting 
electrons, local electron transport ducts cooperating with the sources and each having 
walls of high-ohmic, electrically substantially insulating material having a secondary 
emission coefficient suitable for transporting emitted electrons in the form of electron 
currents and a selection structure comprising selectively energizable electrodes (selection 
electrodes) for withdrawing each electron current from its transport duct at  
 
predetermined extraction locations facing the luminescent screen, while further means 
are provided for directing extracted electrons towards pixels of the luminescent screen 
for producing a picture composed of pixels. The operation of this known display unit is based on the recognition that 
electron transport is possible when electrons impinge on an inner wall of an elongate 
evacuated cavity (referred to as
