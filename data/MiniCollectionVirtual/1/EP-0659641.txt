<ABSTRACT>
Fine fibers 5 are planted on a surface of an object 1 
moving relative to a fluid or on an inside surface of a 

pipe or duct 2 conveying a fluid therethrough at a portion 
which comes into contact with the fluid. 1) When a 

turbulent flow from the upstream side collides with the 
surface covered with the fibers, the fibers 5 function as a 

cushion so as to soften the vortexes and reduce pressure 
fluctuations. 2) The boundary layer near the surface may 

easily be transformed into a turbulent flow by the fine 
fibers 5 so that the flow becomes less spatially 

correlated. Further, when any generated turbulent flow 
passes by, pressure fluctuations can be reduced by the 

fibers. 3) Each fiber is very fine and soft, and therefore 
does not exerts any reaction forces (or any pressure 

fluctuations) against the flow. As a result, the sound 
arising when the flow collides with the fibers is extremely 

softened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an object contacting a fluid and
moving relative to the fluid or being a pipe or duct conveying
the fluid, comprising a fur-like portion having fine fibers
planted thereon so as to reduce sound generated by fluxional
forces acting on the object.Conventionally, when an object made from metal or
resin is placed in fluid relatively moving thereto, it has
been disposed in the fluid with its hard surface exposed to
the fluid. Also, the hard inside surface of conventional
pipes or ducts made from metal or resin for conveying
fluids is exposed to the fluid. Therefore, this relative
movement between the fluid and the wall surface brings
about fluxional force-generated sound. In order to reduce
the fluxional force-generated sound, various techniques
have been made such as smoothing the surface of the object
to make a fluid flow smoothly. Alternatively, as to an
object moving in a fluid, such as a wing, a trailing edge
of the wing is made thin to reduce trailing vortexes to be
generated (see Fig.23A) or the trailing edge may be
provided with serration in order to weaken the correlation
of perpendicular components of the trailing vortexes with 
respect to the flowing direction of the fluid (see
Fig.23B). Further, it is possible to provide tripping
wires on the surface of a rigid body so as to promote
turbulent flow to occur (see Fig.23C).In addition, in the opening end portion of pipes or
ducts, etc. the edge is serrated in order to reduce the
correlation of perpendicular components of the trailing
vortexes with respect to the flow direction of the fluid as
well as to promote jet mixing (see Fig. 23D).In general, it is believed that fluxional force-generated
sound occurs because of pressure fluctuations on
an object surface or inner wall surface of pipes, ducts,
etc. due to boundary layer turbulence on the surface of the
object or the inside surface of the pipes, ducts, etc. or
due to turbulent flow on the upstream side of the flow.
Also, the noise is believed to be generated by pressure
fluctuations induced at a trailing edge of an object or in
the vicinity of an opening end portion of a pipe or duct
due to trailing vortexes produced by the outflow at the
trailing edge or by the outflow from the opening end
portion of the pipe or duct, etc.The fluxional force-generated sound can be reduced
when any of the following conditions are attained. That
is, the sound can be reduced by:
1) reducing the turbulence itself; 2) reducing the pressure fluctuations induced on the object
surface by
