<ABSTRACT>
This method provides for the manufacture of grooves (4) separated by ribs (5) on at least one face or on the flanks of a support plate (1). A coiling wire (8) is coiled around the plate, passing through the grooves. Passage from one groove to a neighbouring groove takes place over a rib. The wire is then held in position (by glue or a resin for example). Next, the face or the flank containing the rib over which the wire passes when it joins one groove to the next is machined. This machining separates the coilings of the various grooves (one coiling per groove) and reveals areas for connection to the conducting wire by electrical access to each conductor. Various embodiments are provided. Application: manufacture of magnetic recording/reading heads and especially heads with matrix control.
