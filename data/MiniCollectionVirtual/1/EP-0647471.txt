<ABSTRACT>
Spent alumina-supported catalyst used in treating metal 
contaminated hydrocarbon feedstocks, and comprising an alumina 

support containing one or more of cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, 
nickel, phosphorus and vanadium, can be reactivated, after 

stripping process oil from the spent catalyst, by contact with 
steam at an elevated temperature. 
The reactivated catalyst can be regenerated by burning off 
carbon deposits using an oxygen-containing gas optionally after 

removal of metal contaminants by means of aqueous sulphuric 
acid containing ammonium ions. 
The reactivation technique can be used in hydrosulphurization 
processes and in the production of low-sulphur product streams 

from petroleum residua having a sulphur content above 2 weight 
percent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for reactivation 
of spent inactive alumina-supported catalysts from a catalytic 
hydrotreating process. More particularly, this invention 
relates to method in which spent catalyst withdrawn from a 
hydrotreating process, such as an H-Oil® hydrogenation process 
using ebullated-bed reactors, is first stripped of process oil 
by, for example, washing with a hydrocarbon solvent, and the 
oil-free catalyst is then contacted with steam at an elevated 
temperature for a period of 2 to 5 hours, thereby providing a 
reactivated catalyst. In another aspect of this invention the 
reactivated catalyst is additionally regenerated by burnoff of 
the carbon and sulphur deposits under controlled conditions in 
the presence of an oxygen-containing gas, optionally after 
rejuvenation of the reactivated catalyst to remove a part or 
substantially all of the metallic deposits. During catalytic reaction processes, as exemplified 
by hydrotreating processes employing ebullated-bed reactors,  
 
the catalysts are gradually deactivated because of an 
accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst 
particles, and by deposition of various metallic elements, such 
as vanadium or nickel. There is a need in the art for a practical method for 
conveniently reactivating spent hydrotreating catalyst 
withdrawn from a fluidized-bed catalytic reactor system, such 
as a processing system utilizing ebullated-bed or continuous 
stirred tank reactors, in hydroprocessing high sulphur and 
metals-containing hydrocarbon feedstocks. CA-A-1 159 402 discloses a process for the recovery 
of used, contaminated catalyst according to particle density 
differences by fluidization in light liquid hydrocarbon 
fractions boiling at 93 to 232°C (200 to 450°F), such as light 
naphtha, kerosene, fuel oil or water. This process is suitable 
for treating used catalyst derived from fluidized - or 
ebullated-bed reactors, such as those used in H-Oil® processes 
which involve continuous or periodic withdrawal of portions of 
used catalyst and their replacement with fresh catalyst, 
thereby producing low-density and high-density fractions of 
used catalyst. The low-density fraction of the used catalyst 
may be regenerated by carbon burnoff, after removal from the 
light hydrocarbon fluidization unit and before being returned  
 
to the reactor. The high-density fraction of used catalyst is 
optionally processed for recovery of deposited metals. US-A-3 809 644 discloses a process for multiple stage 
hydrodesulphurization
