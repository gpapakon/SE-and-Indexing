<ABSTRACT>
A frame aligner circuit (10) for aligning a plurality of information 
packet signals (F1-F4) received within a maximum starting time variation interval 

consists of a plurality of frame detectors (110), stretch circuits (130) and variable 
delay circuits (120) which are controlled by a synchronization signal generator 

(140,150) and a delay control circuit (160). The delay control circuit in one 
embodiment of the present invention delays each information packet signal for a 

duration of time defined by the start of the information packet signal and an interval 
of time following the start of a last received information packet signals. In this 

manner, each information packet signal is delayed a corresponding period of time to 
align (at FA₁ - FA₄) the plurality of information packet signals with respect to one 

another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital signal 
multiplexers in general and in particular to multiplexers 
which operate on frame aligned-digital information packets. In telecommunication and other information transmission 
systems, multiplexing of digital information is utilized to 
transmit multiple information signals simultaneously over a 
common transmission channel. In such systems, digital 
information from different sources is interleaved or 
synchronously multiplexed into a single signal for 
transmission over a channel to a destination receiver. The 
receiver then demultiplexes the received signal into the 
original separate information signals. Systems which organize digital information into 
discrete sequences or packets may require the information 
packets to be aligned before multiplexing and transmission. 
One such system is the synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) 
which is used for the transmission of voice, video and other 
digital information. A general description of SDH is 
provided in CCITT Recommendation G. 707-709 pp. 107-174 
(1989). Within an SDH system, one method of transmitting 
information is to transmit the information in synchronous 
transport module level 1 frames (STM-1 frames). Each STM-1 
frame comprises an 81 byte header containing a pointer and 
overhead information and a payload of 2349 bytes containing 
message information. STM-1 frames are transmitted at a rate 
of 155.52 Mbits/s. Four STM-1 frames may be combined to 
form a single synchronous transfer module level 4 (STM-4) 
frame. In this manner, four STM-1 frames may be transmitted 
simultaneously over a common channel.  In order to form a STM-4 frame, the 2349 byte payloads 
of four STM-1 frames are aligned and then multiplexed into 
the payload of a STM-4 frame. In the same manner, the 
payloads of sixteen STM-1 frames or four STM-4 frames or 
their equivalents may be aligned and multiplexed into the 
payload of a synchronous transfer module level 16 frame 
(STM-16 frame). A general description of synchronous 
transfer modules is found in CCITT Recommendation G.708, §§ 
2.2.7-4.2:3 p. 113-117 (1989). However, the generation of 
STM-1 frames does not occur simultaneously and therefore, 
some manner of frame alignment is required in order to 
transform four STM-1 frames into an STM-4 frame or sixteen 
STM-1 frames into a STM-16 frame. In addition, there are various methods for maintaining 
the proper timing of the operations of interleaving the 
information signals in multiplexers which must be considered 
in
