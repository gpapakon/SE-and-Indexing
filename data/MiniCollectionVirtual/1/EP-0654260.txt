<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with novel odorant compositions. 
More particularly, the invention is concerned with novel odorant 
compositions with prolonged diffusion after the application on the skin. It is well known that mixtures of perfume materials when deposited on the 
skin lose intensity and may change character with time, mainly due to 
factors such as differential evaporation and skin penetration. Many attempts have been made to minimize these drawbacks, but so far 
without notable success. Particularly, efforts have been made to prolong the 
diffusion, as well as to improve other characteristics of perfume materials, 
by e.g. increasing the perfume concentrate concentration or by using 
additives such as silicones, glycerol, polyethylene glycols and so on. Such 
perfume compositions, however, have never been really successful as the 
results obtained were only marginal. Recently, odorant compositions have been described, which are devoid 
of the drawbacks outlined above, see EP 558 721. These compositions, though, 
all contain substantial amounts of ethanol. The present invention now provides such prolonged diffusivity of non - 
alcoholic, namely aqueous perfume solutions. Surprisingly, it has been found that the addition of panthenol (or an 
alkyl ether thereof) significantly improves and particularly prolongs 
diffusion of perfume materials from the skin, without notably modifying the 
olfactory note of the product. The present invention thus concerns odorant 
compositions comprising from about 0.1% to about 30% of perfume 
concentrate, from about 0.1% to about 10% of panthenol or an alkyl, e.g. ethyl 
ether thereof, from about 0.1% to about 50% of a surfactant and from about 
10% to about 99% of water.  The term "odorant composition", as used in connection with the present 
invention, means solutions of perfume materials and stands for well known 
commercial products such as e.g. Deo-Cologne, Eau de Cologne, Eau de 
Toilette, Perfume Extrait and so on, though necessitating no alcohol. The term "perfume concentrate" stands for the required mixture of any 
perfume materials of synthetic and/or natural origin. The term "panthenol" as used in connection with the present invention 
stands for DL-panthenol or for D-panthenol. The nature of the surfactant, which operates as a solubilizer, is by no 
means critical and encompasses thus anionic, cationic and amphotheric 
surfactants. Its concentration is conveniently between ca. 0.1 and ca. 50%. A representative list of such surfactants can be
