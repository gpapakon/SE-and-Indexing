<ABSTRACT>
The starch-synthesising ability of plants, particularly 
cereals, may be modified by insertion into their genomes by 

genetic transformation a DNA encoding ADP-glucose 
pyrophosphorylase. Extra copies of the DNA enhance and 

antisense variants thereof reduce the starch-synthesising 
ability of the plants by enhancing or inhibiting expression of 

the enzyme.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the isolation, 
purification and characterisation of the enzyme 
ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and the production of 
antibodies which can be used in the the identification 
of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNA clones. The 
invention also relates to the use of cDNA clones to 
increase starch yield in cereals such as wheat, maize 
and barley is described. Starch is an important end-product of carbon 
fixation during photosynthesis in leaves and is an 
important storage product in seeds and fruits. In 
economic terms, the starch produced by the edible 
portions of three grain crops, wheat, rice and maize, 
provide approximately two-thirds of the world's food 
calculated as calories. Starch is synthesised in the plastid compartment, 
the chloroplast, in photosynthetic cells or the 
amyloplast in non- photosynthetic cells. The biochemical 
pathway of starch biosynthesis in leaves has been 
well-characterised. In contrast, little is known of the 
pathway of starch biosynthesis in storage organs. 
However, the recent development of a method for the 
isolation of intact amyloplasts from wheat endosperm 
cells has contributed to the elucidation of the pathway 
of starch biosynthesis in that organ. Other research has 
shown that the pathways of starch biosynthesis in wheat 
endosperm and wheat leaves are different.  The plastid enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is 
an important regulatory enzyme of starch biosynthesis in 
photosynthetic plant organs. The chloroplast ADP-glucose 
pyrophosphorylase is regulated post-translationally by 
the allosteric effectors 3-phosphoglycerate and 
orthophosphate. All plant leaf ADP-glucose 
pyrophosphorylase enzymes studied are activated invitro 
by 3-phosphoglycerate, and to a lesser extent by 
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, fructose-6-phosphate and 
phosphoenol pyruvate. These metabolites lower the Km 
values of substrates and increase the Vmax of the 
enzyme-catalysed reaction. In addition, the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 
enzymes from plant leaves are inhibited invitro by 
orthophosphate, with half-maximal inhibition of enzyme 
activity generally achieved in orthophosphate 
concentrations of less than Âµ100 M. Leaf starch biosynthesis is regulated invitro by 
fluctuations in the chloroplastic levels of 
3-phosphoglycerate and orthophosphate, at the level of 
the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase enzyme. Crucial to 
this regulatory mechanism is the selective permeability 
of the chloroplast inner membrane. It has been shown 
that the inner membrane of
