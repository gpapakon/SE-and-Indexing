<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention, in general, relates to a crosslinked, 
flame-retarded resin composition and the insulated wire having a sheath layer, 
and particularly to a crosslinked, flame-retardant resin composition capable 
of protecting a flammable inner material from a direct fire and an 
insulated wire having a sheath layer using the above composition. It is known to those skilled to the art that an insulated wire used 
in high voltage-operating electric equipment such as television sets, 
microwave ovens, and duplicators etc. has such a structure that an 
electric wire is coated with an insulating layer which is encapsulated 
with a protecting sheath layer. As an insulating layer for the insulated 
wire, there has been used a polymer of polyethlylene or polypropylene. The 
polymers have such an excellent insulation resistance property that they are 
endurable to high voltages up to several tens of KVs. Such polymers, however, 
have a disadvantage of being combustible in themselves. To overcome the 
combustible property of polyethylene or polypropylene, in general, additives 
such as flame-retardant fillers are added. The addition of such 
additives, however, causes the insulation resistance property 
of the polymers to deteriorate in spite of giving an improvement of flame-retardancy to them. 
So, the wire coated with the polymers having such additives is not suitable  
 
for a high voltage-operating equipment. In an effort to make up for the deficient property of flammability 
of the polymers, a material for a sheath layer which protects the flammable 
insulating layer is made to have an excellent property of flame-retardancy. 
Polyvinylchloride, crosslinked polyvinylchloride or crosslinked 
flame-retardant polyethylene has been chiefly used for a conventional sheath 
layer. When they are made to have a property of high flame-retardancy, 
mechanical properties and flexibility thereof are deteriorated so largely that 
the wire sheathed with them is unsatisfactory to be applied to electrical 
equipment. In fact, the sheath layer of insulated wire is not necessarily to have 
high insulation resistance. It is preferable to minimize deterioration of 
flexibility as much as possible when the material for sheath layer is made to 
have an excellent property of flame-retardancy. The above mentioned 
conventional materials for sheath layer have an excellent property of 
flame-retardancy and yet, do not show good flexibility. Thus, the above 
mentioned conventional materials are not desirable for sheath materials
