<ABSTRACT>
Whether or not a luminance signal of an HD input signal 
is input to a picture signal recording apparatus is detected, 

and a recording mode is determined according to the detection 
of the luminance signal in a recording mode determining unit. 

In cases where the luminance signal is detected, first and 
second color difference signals of the HD input signal are 

alternately deleted on every scanning line. Thereafter, the 
luminance signal pertaining to odd-numbered scanning lines and 

the first color difference signal are time-compressed and 
multiplexed on every scanning line, and the luminance signal 

pertaining to even-numbered scanning lines and the second 
color difference signal are time-compressed and multiplexed on 

every scanning line. In contrast, in cases where the luminance 
signal is not detected, a luminance signal and first and 

second color difference signals of a normal picture signal 
input to the apparatus are time-compressed and multiplexed on 

every scanning line. Thereafter, the signals multiplexed are 
recorded on a magnetic tape according to the recording mode. 

Therefore, even though the number of scanning lines in the HD 
input signal is higher than that in the normal picture signal, 

the first and second color signals can be recorded within a 
limited frequency band.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to picture signal recording
method and apparatus for recording not only a high-definition
picture signal but also a normal picture signal. Also, the
present invention relates to a picture signal recording
apparatus for recording a picture signal such as a normal
picture signal or a high-definition picture signal by
determining a recording mode in dependence on a type of the
picture signal and a high-definition picture signal
reproducing apparatus for reproducing the picture signal
recorded with the high-definition picture signal recording
apparatus by distinguishing the recording mode.A so-called UNIHI (a registered trademark) type of high-vision
video tape recorder (VTR) has been well-known as a
magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus for
recording/reproducing a high-definition picture signal which 
has a wider frequency band than that of a normal picture
signal conventionally utilized and has a larger number of
scanning lines than that of the normal picture. In the high-vision
VTR, a pair of color difference signals belonging to a
high-definition picture signal are respectively converted in
order of scanning lines to produce a plurality color
difference line signals, and the color difference line signals
are respectively time-compressed to produce a plurality of
compressed color difference line signals. In this case,
because the number of scanning lines in the high-definition
picture signal is too high to record the color difference line
signals, the color difference line signals are thinned out on
every other scanning line to reduce the number of color
difference line signals time-compressed. Also, a luminance
signal belonging to a high-definition picture signal is time-compressed
to produce a compressed luminance signal.
Thereafter, the compressed color difference line signals and
the compressed luminance signal are unified according to a
time-division multiplexing to produce a time compressed
integration (TCI) signal, and the TCI signal is recorded and
reproduced to/from an information recording medium such as a
magnetic tape.The reason that the color difference line signals are
thinned out on every other scanning line is that a quality of
picture image displayed in a displaying unit according to the 
high-definition signal reproduced is not degraded so much.However, In cases where not only a high-definition
picture signal but also a normal picture signal conventionally
utilized are recorded and reproduced to/from an information
recording medium in the high-vision
