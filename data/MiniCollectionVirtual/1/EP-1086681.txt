<ABSTRACT>
The mattress (3), containing a series of tubes (34) which can be inflated alternately, simultaneously or to a variable pressure, has the tubes incorporated individually or in groups in one or more inserts (31) designed to be fitted detachably into cavities (30) in the surface of the mattress. The mattress itself can be inflatable, shaped to leave one or more cavities in its surface after inflation, made from a block of synthetic foam with a removable protective cover, or from two layers of foam (32, 33) with different properties, the upper one being agreeable to the touch.

Device for an adjustable low pressure mattress, used in particular for preventing the formation of bedsore, of the type including several cells inflatable alternately, simultaneously or at variable pressure, according to predefined sequences, in order to create on the surface of the mattress a movement comparable, for the patient, to a massage, 
characterized in that
 said cells (16 ; 26 ; 34) are incorporated, individually and/or grouped, in at least one insert (13, 14, 15 ; 23, 24, 25 ; 31) designed to be placed, removably, in at least one excavation (10, 11, 12 ; 20, 21, 22 ; 30) made on one of the sides of the mattress (1 ; 2 ; 3).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the mattress consists of an inflatable mattress which, after inflation, leaves one or more openings capable of receiving said inserts.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the mattress consists of a pad (1 ; 2 ; 3) of synthetic foam rubber covered with a removable protective cover.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 each insert consists of a fabric strip or similar on one side of which are made integral transversally longitudinal envelopes designed, each, to receive an inflatable cell.
Device according to any of claims 1 through 3, 
characterized in that
 each insert (13, 14, 15 ; 23, 24, 25 ; 31) consists of a pad of synthetic foam rubber capable of being covered with a removable protective cover, and in which is made at least one housing designed to accommodate at least one inflatable cell (16 ; 26 ; 34).
Device according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the mattress (1 ; 2 ; 3) and the insert (13, 14, 15 ; 23, 24, 25 ; 31) are made by superposing two layers (17, 18 ; 27, 28 ; 32, 33) of synthetic foam rubbers having different characteristics so that the upper layer (17 ; 27 ; 32) is pleasant to touch.
Device according to any of claims 3, 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 the synthetic foam rubbers consist of polyether-based polyurethane foams.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it includes several inserts (13, 14, 15 ; 23, 24, 25) of which at least two, of equal dimensions and in which the inflatable cells (16 ; 26) are arranged differently, are interchangeable.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 at least one of the inserts (13, 14, 15 ; 23, 24, 25) is connected to the air compressor independently of the other inserts.
Device according to any of claims 1 through 8, 
characterized in that
 it includes an insert (31) incorporating at least two groups (35, 36) of inflatable cells (34), and that is reversible lengthwise.
Device according to claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the insert includes two groups (35, 36), unequal in number, of inflatable cells (34), the group (35) having the largest number of inflatable cells (34) is designed to be positioned under the patient's pelvis, whereas the group (36) having the smallest number of inflatable cells (34) is designed to be positioned under the feet or under the head of said patient, according to the orientation given to said insert (31).
Device according to claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the thickness of the insert (31) is gradually decreasing from the end of the group (35) having the largest number of inflatable cells (34) to its end including the other group (36) of inflatable cells (34).
Device according to any of claims 10 through 12, 
characterized in that
 the insert (31) is provided with means (39) for fixing to the back of an armchair.
