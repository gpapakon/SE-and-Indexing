<ABSTRACT>
In a computer system in which a plurality of computers are linked 
together, a host computer runs an application program which can be operated on 

by the remote computers. A window in the display of each computer is 
controlled to display the same image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating a plurality of interlinked computers. Modern telephone systems allow multiple parties at different locations to 
hold a conference. However, telephone conferences do not provide all of the 
conveniences of a face-to-face conference, where participants all meet at a 
common table in a meeting room. For example, in a meeting room, participants 
can view an object of interest, such as a drawing or a product. Such viewing is 
not possible in a telephone conference. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved electronic 
conferencing system. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided 
a method of operating a plurality of computers linked together by a common 
data channel, characterized by the steps of: operating said computers under the 
control of respective message-driven operating systems which generate 
messages indicative of input control events on said computers; running an 
application program on one of said computers acting as a host computer, 
examining messages directed to the application program; ignoring messages not 
directed to the application program; and informing remote computers of 
messages which are directed to the application program. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by telephone lines. Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in Figures 3-14. 
In the example, a calculator program is operated, and annotated, by various 
parties. Figure 3 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 4 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 5 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
operate the calculator, in Application mode. Figure 6 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
operate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode.  Figure 7 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
annotate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode. Figure 8 illustrates how the system responds to a host user when in View 
mode. Figure 9 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user attempts 
to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 10 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user 
attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a plurality of computers linked together by a 
common data channel, characterized by the steps of: operating said computers 

under the control of respective message-driven operating systems which 
generate messages indicative of input control events on said computers; running 

an application program on one of said computers acting as a host computer, 

examining messages directed to the application program; ignoring messages not 
directed to the application program; and informing remote computers of 

messages which are directed to the application program. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that said input control 
events include keyboard events and mouse events. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said application 
program provides output to the display of said host computer, characterized by 

the step of replicating the display of said host computer on the other computers. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
by the steps of allowing a user of any computer to annotate the display of the 

user's computer; and replicating the annotations on the displays of other 
computers. 
A method according to claim 3 or claim 4, characterized by the step of 
preventing the replication of selected areas of the displays of the computers. 
A method according to claim 4 or claim 5 characterized by the steps of 
displaying visual data in windows of said displays; replicating at least one 

window on all of said displays; and allowing a user to prevent replication of a 
selected window on the user's display. 
A computer system for carrying out a method according to any one of 
the preceding claims, including a plurality of interlinked computers, and control 

 
means adapted to enable the user of one of said computers to control the 

operation of an application program running on another of said computers.
