<ABSTRACT>
An installation and method is disclosed for mounting an air 
bag system (16) in an opening in an instrument panel (12). A stabilizer 

frame (11) is fixed around the opening in an instrument panel substrate 
(22) and anchored to a fixed substructure, restraining bulging movement 

of the instrument panel (12) to rapidly develop shearing stresses in the 
covering layer (20) by the pressure exerted by the deployment door 

substrate panel (18) as it is pushed open by the inflating air bag (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns air bag safety systems for passenger
vehicles and more particularly the formation of a deployment
opening which allows the air bag to be inflated and to enter the
passenger compartment of the vehicle. The generic part of claim 1 relies
on U.S. patent US-A- 5080393.In many designs, a deployment opening is formed by a hinged
door or doors fit into an opening formed in the trim structure
behind which the air bag is installed. Upon initiation of the air
bag system, the air bag is rapidly inflated forcing the deployment
door to hinge open and allow the air bag to deploy into the
passenger compartment.An example of this is shown in U.S. patent no. 4,893,833
issued on January 16, 1990, for a "Closure for an Air Bag
Deployment Opening". In that design, frangible shearing tabs are
relied on to secure the deployment door against opening which
frangible tabs is sheared off upon the inflation of the air bag
exerting pressure on the inside of the deployment door.For another example see also U.S. patent no. 4,989,896 issued
on January 5, 1991, for a "Double Door Closure for an Air Bag
Deployment Opening".In such designs the deployment door is readily visible to the
vehicle occupants. For improved styling and to not invite
tampering, there has been developed an invisible seam deployment
door installation in which the deployment door and the outline of
the opening to be formed are not visible but rather the area
whereat the deployment door will be formed when the air bag system
is operated is overlain by a smooth covering as of a vinyl covering
layer.In this instance, it is necessary to cut through the covering
layer upon initiation of the air bag system operation.A decorative covering layer of vinyl is relatively tough and
difficult to sever. It is also critical to proper operation that
the air bag deployment occur within a very brief time span, on the 
order of several milliseconds.Significant delay in the deployment of the air bag can defeat
or seriously impair the effectiveness of the air bag system.In U.S. patent no. 5,217,244 issued on June 8, 1993, for an
"Arrangement for Forming and Air Bag Deployment Opening", and U.S.
patent no. 5,080,393 issued on January 14, 1992, for a "Method and
Apparatus for Forming an Air Bag Deployment Opening" there is
described the use of linear energy generating elements to
completely or partially degrade the vinyl in a pattern overlying
the deployment door or doors such as to ensure instantaneous
severing of the covering layer.U.S. patent no. 5,082,310

<CLAIMS>
An air bag installation for the passenger compartment of
a vehicle comprising:


an interior trim piece (12) mounted in said passenger
compartment (14) and having a substrate panel (18) formed

with an opening (16), said interior trim piece (12)
mounted to a fixed structure in said passenger compartment

(14);
an air bag storing canister (28) mounted behind said trim
piece substrate panel (22) aligned with said opening (16)

therein, said air bag storing canister (28) containing an
air bag to be deployed by inflation thereof;
at least one deployment door substrate panel (18) fit
into said opening (16) and hinged along one side to a

portion of said trim piece substrate panel (22) adjacent
said opening (16);
a covering layer (20) extending uninterruptedly over said
trim piece substrate panel (22) and said deployment door

substrate panel (18) to conceal said deployment door substrate
panel (18) from view, said deployment door substrate

panel (18) forced through said covering layer (20)
when said air bag is deployed, 
characterized
 by
a perimeter stiffening frame (11) extending around said
opening (16) and fixed relative said trim piece substrate

panel (22), and by
anchoring elements (46A-46C) attached to said perimeter
stiffening frame (11) and to said fixed structure in said

passenger compartment (14) to thereby stabilize and restrain
the perimeter of said opening from outward bulging

upon forcing of said deployment door substrate panel (18)
to hinge open by inflation of said air bag and penetrating

said covering layer (20).
The installation according to claim 1 wherein said covering
layer (20) is of vinyl plastic. 
The installation according to claim 2 further including a
foam layer (26) interposed between said trim piece substrate

panel (22) and said deployment door substrate
panel (18) and said vinyl plastic covering layer (20).
The installation according to anyone of claims 1 to 3
wherein said deployment door substrate panel (18) is generally

rectangular having three free sides and a hinging
side.
The installation according to claim 4 further including
fixed stops (36) on which said three sides of said deployment

door substrate panel (18) rest to prevent inward
movement.
A method of forming an air bag deployment opening in a
trim piece in a passenger compartment (14) of a vehicle

behind which an air bag is stored for inflation upon activation,
said trim piece including a substrate panel

(22), said method comprising the steps of:

forming an opening (16) in said trim piece substrate
panel (22) aligned with said stored air bag;
fitting at least one deployment door substrate panel (18)
into said opening (16) by hinging said deployment door

substrate panel (18) along one side thereof so as to be
able to open by swinging away when pushed by inflation of

said air bag;
covering said trim piece substrate panel (18) with a covering
layer (20) extending uninterruptedly over said trim

piece substrate panel (22) and over said deployment door
substrate panel (18);
mounting a stabilizer frame (11) to said
trim piece substrate panel (22) extending about said

opening (16) and anchoring said stabilizer frame (11) to
fixed structure in said passenger compartment (14).
