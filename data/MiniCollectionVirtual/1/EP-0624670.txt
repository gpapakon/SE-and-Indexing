<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an adjusting device for a loom 
in which weaving is effected by passing a shuttle (1) containing 

a cup (2) around which a weaved yarn is wound between upper and 
lower warp yarns, comprising: a disc shaped reel (73) provided 

with circumferential channel parts (73a) for accommodating a 
wound thread thereon; thread holding means projecting outward of 

said circumferential channel parts (73a) of said reel (73) for 
holding threads; and hooking means (76) for hooking the threads 

held by said holding means and rotating said threads so as to 
twist said threads, thereby winding said twisted threads onto 

said circumferential channel parts (73a) of said reel (73).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjusting device 
for a shuttle-type loom. In general, in a conventional loom employing shuttles, 
opening operations for repeatedly separating the warps into 
upper and lower groups are repeatedly performed, while 
simultaneously the shuttle incorporating therein the wefts is 
passed between the upper and lower warps in synchronism with 
the opening operation. For example, as shown in Figs. 2A and 
2B, the convention shuttle 1, which has generally a boat-like 
shape, has a recess 1a which receives an elongated cop 2 
around which the threads of the warp 4 are wound. A tong is 
provided in a rear portion of the recess 1a mounted so as to 
be rotatable through about 90Â° so as to be movable from a 
horizontal position to a vertical position. The cop 2 is 
received in a horizontal position within the recess 1a under 
the condition that the tong 3 is inserted into a hole 2a 
formed in the bottom of the cop 2. Then, the wefts 4 are 
extracted to the outside through a hole 1b formed in the 
front portion of the shuttle 1.  With this construction, the amount of weft 4 held within 
the shuttle 1 decreases as the shuttle performs its 
reciprocating motion. When the weft has been completely 
consumed, it is necessary to stop the operation of the 
machine. Therefore, in the conventional machine, when it is 
observed that the remaining amount of the weft 4 is small, 
the operator, who, for this purpose, must stand by the 
machine, must manually perform the exchange of cops. That 
is, the weft of the old cop, which has nearly been expended, 
is cut and the old cop manually removed from the shuttle 1. 
Then, a new cop is loaded into the shuttle 1, and the new and 
old threads are tied together. Generally, therefore, it is necessary that an individual 
operator be assigned to each loom during its operation since 
the cops 2 must be replaced frequently. This of course is a 
major factor in the total labor costs for operating the loom. 
Also, since looms employing high speed shuttles are 
inherently very noise, the operator may fatigue easily. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the cost of operating a 
loom while simultaneously improving the quality of the 
working environment around the loom. In the prior art, 
however, due to the complexities of the operations involved 
in handling the threads, automation of the cop-replacing 
operation had not been attained.  Overcoming the above-discussed drawbacks of the prior 
art, the invention provides  
 
a thread tying apparatus including a

<CLAIMS>
An adjusting device for a loom in which weaving is 
effected by passing a shuttle containing a cop around which a 

weft yarn is wound between upper and lower warp yarns, 
comprising: a disc-shaped reel provided with circumferential 

channel parts for accommodating a wound thread thereon; 
thread holding means projecting outward of said 

circumferential channel parts of said reel for holding 
threads; and hooking means for hooking the threads held by 

said holding means and rotating said threads so as to twist 
said threads, thereby winding the twisted threads onto said 

circumferential channel parts of said reel. 
The adjusting device of claim 1, further 
comprising a hollow block body, said disc-shaped reel being 

mounted on a forward end area of said block body; and a 
mounting jig for fixing said hollow block body on a fixed 

loom part. 
The adjusting device of claim 1, wherein said 
hooking means comprises a motor mounted on said hollow block 

body; a speed reduction gear attached to an output shaft of 
said motor; a revolving shaft mounted inside said block body, 

 
one end of said revolving shaft being coupled to an output of 

said speed reduction gear and the other end of said revolving 
shaft protruding from a front end side of said reel, a 

penetrating hole extending perpendicular to an axial 
direction of said revolving shaft being formed in the 

protruding portion of said revolving shaft; a guide bar 
inserted in said penetrating hole; and a hooking device fixed 

to one end of said guide bar for snagging a weft to wind said 
weft around said reel.
