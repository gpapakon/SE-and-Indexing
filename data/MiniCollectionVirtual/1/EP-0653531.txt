<ABSTRACT>
Swimming bath pool having a retaining wall (3) which, in the active 
position, relative to the longitudinal direction thereof, extends between 

opposite side walls, in the direction at right angles thereto, at a 
distance from further opposite side walls 

and essentially from the bottom (2) 
upwards to above the water level in order to divide the pool into various 

sections lying next to each other, which retaining wall can optionally be 
brought into an active, separating position, and into an inactive 

position. According to the invention, the retaining wall is fastened to 
the bottom and can be swung between an essentially horizontal, inactive 

position, running parallel with the swimming bath bottom, and an active 
position in which the retaining wall runs upwards from the bottom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a swimming bath pool according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Such a swimming bath pool having a retaining wall is known from 
DE-A-2517337. Said known retaining wall is at its lower edge pivotally 
connected to the opposing side walls of the swimming bath pool. This 
known retaining wall is shiftable between a vertical, upright position to 
extend above the water level, and a substantially horizontal, retracted 
position to lie substantially flat with one of its side walls with the 
surface of the swimming bath bottom, to be received in a recess in said 
swimming bath bottom. The known retaining wall is locked in its upright 
position by retention between cam-shaped stopper elements on each 
respective side wall of the swimming bath pool which, viewed in the 
longitudinal direction of the retaining wall, can engage with both sides 
of said retaining wall at its upper edge. The known retaining wall is 
hollow, and can be filled with water or air respectively. By replacing 
the water by air, or visa versa, the retaining wall can be swung between 
its upright, active position and its retracted, inactive position. A disadvantage of this known retaining wall is its rather poor 
connection with the structure of the swimming bath pool. On the one hand 
this yield a relative week and flexible retaining wall, which is a 
disadvantage for swimmers which use the retaining wall as an abutment for 
their feet if they turn around while fast swimming in a straight 
direction between the retaining wall and the opposing side wall of the 
swimming bath pool. Apart from that, for swimming competition, lines will 
be connected to the retaining wall and the opposing side wall of the 
swimming bath pool to divide the pool in several delimited tracks. Due to 
the high tension forces in such lines, the known retaining wall, due to 
its poor connection to the structure of the swimming bath pool, will give 
too much flexural displacement in the centre part, such that the length 
of the tracks is not the same, and the pool can not be used for 
tournaments. The rather low stiffness of the connection of the retaining 
wall could be eliminated by increasing the flexural stiffness of the 
retaining wall itself, however this calls for a larger volume of the 
retaining wall, demanding further structural elements, such that 
increasing its flexural stiffness yields a substantial rise of capital 
investments and such a stiffening can not avoid a further disadvantage of  
 
this known retaining wall; in its

<CLAIMS>
Swimming bath pool (1) having a plate shaped retaining wall 
(3), which can be moved into an active, projecting position to extend 

from the vicinity of the swimming bath bottom (2) to the water level (10) 
and projecting there above, to split the swimming bath pool in two parts 

on both sides of the said retaining wall, and can be moved in a retracted 
position, such that swimmers can pass the said retaining wall 

substantially unhindered, in which the said retaining wall can be pivoted 
with respect to the swimming bath bottom, and the said retaining wall at 

its upper edge to project above the water level is free from bodies 
extending along said edge and which are meant to retain said retaining 

wall in its active, extended position, and with elements (6) to lock the 
retaining wall in its active position, characterised in that the said 

retaining wall is coupled with the said swimming bath bottom (2) by 
swing- or pivot connections (9) distributed over the length of the said 

retaining wall, and that the said locking elements are distributed over 
the length of the said retaining wall as well, and are active between the 

said retaining wall and the said swimming bath bottom. 
Swimming bath pool according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the swimming bath bottom (2), on the side facing the retaining wall (3), 

is provided with a recess (4) for receiving the retaining wall (3) when 
it is in its inactive position, in such a manner that the latter is level 

with the upper surface of the bottom (2). 
Swimming bath pool according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the retaining wall (3), at its base and with one longitudinal edge, is 

connected to the bottom (2) by means of a hinge (9) at the boundary of 
the recess (4), at the upper surface (2), and in that a sealing flap (5), 

running in line with the retaining wall and made of a relatively readily 
flexible material, is attached to the opposite longitudinal edge, at the 

base of the retaining wall (3), which sealing flap (5), when the 
retaining wall (3) is in its active position, fills the gap which is 

defined by the underside of the base of the retaining wall (3) and the 
bottom of the recess (4). 
Swimming bath pool according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the retaining wall (3) is provided at its base with 

one or more drive arms (6), which, in relation to the height direction of 
the retaining wall (3), project from said base and into the bottom (2), 

and to the end of which a drive means (7) is connected.  
 
Pool according to Claim 4, characterized in that a blocking 
element (8) is provided, which interacts with one or more of the drive 

arms (6) when the retaining wall (3) is in its active position in order 
to prevent swinging over in the direction from the inactive position. 
Swimming bath pool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the said retaining wall forms integral part with a substantially plate 

shaped bridging body (13), running between a bottom part (14) at a lower 
level and a bottom part (15) at a higher level of the swimming bath 

bottom. 
Swimming bath pool according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the said retaining wall (3) is coupled to the bottom part (15) of the 

swimming bath bottom at a higher level via the swing- or pivot 
connections (16). 
Swimming bath pool according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that the said retaining wall (3) can slight or shift with respect to the 

said upper part (15) of the said swimming bath bottom viewed in the 
direction of the upper edge towards the lower edge of the said retaining 

wall (3) or vice versa. 
Swimming bath pool according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the space between two adjacent swing- or pivot 

connections is about the same as the distance between the lower and upper 
longitudinal edge of the said retaining wall (3) at a maximum. 
Pool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that at least one section of the bottom (2) is constructed to be 

adjustable in height.
