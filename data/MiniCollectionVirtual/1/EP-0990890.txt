<ABSTRACT>
A method of verifying the authenticity of a packaged product involves providing
a package that includes a product, a packaging material covering at least one surface

of the product, and at least two fluorescent materials, which (a) each can be disposed
in or on the packaging material, (b) each can be disposed in or on at least one surface

of the product, or (c) can be separated so that at least one of them is disposed in or
on the packaging material and at least one of them is disposed in or on at least one

surface of the product. The package is exposed to excitation radiation including one
or more wavelengths in the range of from about 250 to about 400 nm, the luminescent

radiation emitted by said fluorescent materials is spectroscopically detected in the
wavelength range of about 300 to about 475 nm, and an intensity versus wavelength

plot of the emitted radiation over at least a portion of the range of wavelengths
detected is compiled. This compiled plot is compared against a previously measured,

stored emitted radiation intensity versus wavelength plot from an authenticated
standard so as to determine whether the packaged product is authentic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of determining the
authenticity of packaged products and, specifically, to the detection and analysis of
radiation emitted by fluorescent materials to determine whether or not a packaged
product is authentic.Throughout history, extensive efforts have been undertaken in attempts to
ensure that certain valuable documents and objects were genuine. Measures
employed have ranged from wax seals impressed with the signets of monarchs to, in
more recent times, devices such as holograms, water marks, microreplicated patterns,
and the like. Especially with respect to documents such as negotiable instruments,
numerous measures involving printing techniques, special inks and/or dyes,
fluorescent materials, and the like have been employed. For a succinct overview of
such measures, the reader is directed to the Background of the Invention section of
U.S. Patent 5,644,352 (Chang et al.), as well as the documents cited therein.Relatively recently, products displayed and sold from store shelves have
become of more interest to counterfeiters. One class of such valuable, yet easily
duplicated products is computer software. Much time, energy, and intellect is
expended in creating such products, yet a counterfeiter can reproduce such products
in a short amount of time and without expending much effort or money. Accordingly,
anti-counterfeit measures have become of great interest to developers and
manufacturers of products such as computer software.One of the first measures employed in efforts to thwart counterfeiters involved
holograms; however, after a relatively short amount of time, counterfeiters were able
to reproduce such holograms with relative ease. More recently, microreplicated
patterns have been employed. While these are much harder to produce, one wishing
to verify the authenticity of a product on a store shelf needs to inspect each product
individually. This type of inspection often can be slow and labor intensive. Further,
microreplicated patterns can involve additional costs because the authenticity feature
is not incorporated into an existing part of the packaged product in question.Retail products such as computer software often come packaged in a
paperboard box sealed in a thermoplastic film. Because the type of film used to wrap
such packages often is relatively simple (e.g., a single-layer polyethylene film), 
counterfeiters have little problem finding converters who can take polymeric resin(s),
make simple films, and seal the film around the

A method of verifying the authenticity of a packaged product, comprising:

(a) providing a package which comprises

1) a product,
2) a packaging material covering at least one surface of said
product, and
3) more than 10 up to about 50,000 parts per million
independently of at least two fluorescent materials, said

fluorescent materials being capable of excitation by
radiation in the wavelength range of about 250 to about

400 nm and emission of radiation in the wavelength range
of about 300 to about 475 nm, wherein one of the following

is true:

(a) each of said fluorescent materials is disposed in or
on said packaging material,
(b) each of said fluorescent materials is disposed in or
on at least one surface of said product, or
(c) at least one of said fluorescent materials is
disposed in or on said packaging material and at

least one of said fluorescent materials is disposed
in or on at least one surface of said product;
(b) exposing said package to a source of excitation radiation
comprising wavelengths in the range of about 250 to about 400

nm, preferably from about 300 nm to about 350 nm, so that said
fluorescent materials are excited by said excitation radiation;
(c) spectroscopically detecting the radiation emitted by said
fluorescent materials in the wavelength range of about 300 to

about 475 nm;
(d) compiling an intensity versus wavelength plot of said emitted
ultraviolet radiation over at least a portion of the range of

wavelengths detected; and
(e) comparing said compiled intensity versus wavelength plot against
a previously measured, stored intensity versus wavelength plot of

an authenticated standard so as to determine whether said
packaged product is authentic.
The method of claim 1 wherein the comparison of said intensity versus
wavelength plots involves comparing intensity values at one or more

wavelengths, preferably comparing ratios of intensity values at two or more
wavelengths.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein each of said fluorescent materials
is disposed in said packaging material, preferably in an amount of from about

15 to about 10,000 parts per million.

The method of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein at least one of said at
least two fluorescent materials has a wavelength of maximum excitation in the

range of between about 300 and about 350 nm.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein at least one of said at
