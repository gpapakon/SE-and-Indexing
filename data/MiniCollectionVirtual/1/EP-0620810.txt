<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
purified 6-aminocapronitrile from a mixture containing 
tetrahydroazepine (THA) by converting the THA to higher 
boiling compounds and then recovering 6-aminocapronitrile 
by controlled distillation. The 6-aminocapronitrile is 
then sufficiently pure to be polymerized to a high 
molecular weight 6-nylon having good color and low gel 
content. The polymerization of 6-aminocapronitrile to 
form nylon polymer is disclosed in Greenewalt U.S. Patent 
2,245,129, and Curatolo et al. U.S. Patent 4,586,736. When 6-aminocapronitrile is produced by partial 
hydrogenation of adiponitrile, hexamethylenediamine and 
tetrahydroazepine (THA), are coproduced. THA is 
represented by the formula: 
The hexamethylenediamine is easily removed from 
the mixture by simple distillation, but THA is not easily 
separated. The presence of THA in the 6-aminocapronitrile 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 6-ACN) that 
is to be polymerized limits the molecular weight of the 
polymer and causes color and branching in the polymer.  
 
It is, therefore important that THA be removed from the 
6-ACN before polymerization. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a simple and efficient method of obtaining 6-ACN 
that is free from THA. The present invention is a process for the 
recovery of 6-ACN from a mixture with tetrahydroazepine 
which comprises reacting a methylene compound selected 
from the group consisting of malonitrile, 
dicyclopentadiene, cyclopentadiene, nitromethane, 
nitroethane, and indene with the tetrahydroazepine in the 
mixture and then distilling 6-ACN from the resulting 
mixture. 6-ACN can be produced by partial hydrogenation 
of adiponitrile. Hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and small 
quantities of tetrahydroazepine (THA) are coproduced. 
HMD is easily removed by simple distillation. THA, 
however, cannot be removed by simple distillation. It is 
important that THA be removed, since it limits molecular 
weight and causes color and branching during 
polymerization of 6-ACN to nylon 6. Addition of certain reactive methylene 
compounds to 6-ACN contaminated with THA, converts the 
THA into products which can be separated by simple 
distillation. Ordinarily, one would define the reactivity of 
useful materials in terms of the compounds which function 
in the so-called Knoevenagel reaction, "the base 
catalyzed reaction of an aldehyde with malonic acid and 
other compounds having a methylene group activated by 
carbonyl, nitrile, or nitro groups" (from Fieser and 
Fie
