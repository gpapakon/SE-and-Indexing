<ABSTRACT>
The economic efficiency of information coding and transmission depends in particular on the bandwidth and the time required for transmission. In order to code and transmit information in a reliable and economic manner, an additional effective combination code is provided, taking into account the object to be transmitted, for example in the case of telefax in particular the gray tone transmission. A multistage combination code with a constant phase position which precedes or follows the code elements and/or a different number of periods having identical or different durations is used as code, together with an amplitude code. An amplitude stage is used as redundant or quasi-stage for unambiguously identifying determined code combinations. In the case of gray tone coding and telefax transmission, conversion is transferred to the receiver according to the dither process, allowing quicker transmission. In all transmission cases, frequently repeated code elements, code words and lines in succession are condensed and the number of repetitions is coded and transmitted before or after the code elements, the code words or the coded lines.

A process for encoding and transmitting information such as
images and/or data by means of multi-value phase encoding, wherein

different phase positions of pulses (-Ph, Ph, +Ph in Figure 1) in
relation to a predetermined phase position of comparison clock pulses

(n1, n2, ... in Figure 1) are provided as phase steps, a change in the
phase positions in that case being effected by reducing or increasing the

pulse duration with respect to the comparison clock pulses, and wherein
the respective pulse duration is represented by a predetermined number of

periods of at least one alternating current of a frequency, the
respectively following pulse being marked by an amplitude change.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the comparison phase
position and pulse phase positions leading and lagging in relation

thereto are provided as phase steps (Figure 1, -Ph, +Ph).
A process according to claims 1 and 2 wherein, with the same
phase position in respect of the subsequent pulse or pulses, the pulse

duration thereof is equal to the pulse duration of the comparison pulses.
A process according to claims 1 to 3 wherein an increase in the
steps is effected in that the steps are either distributed on to two

alternating currents which are phase-shifted through 90° and subsequently
added and transmitted in that form, or the pulses are distributed on to

two alternating currents which are modulated on to two carriers which are
phase-shifted through 90°, and transmission is effected by addition of

the carriers.
A process according to claims 1 to 4 wherein amplitude encoding
is provided in addition to the phase encoding.
