<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a connection device (1) for the rapid and releaseable connection of plastic pipelines. This is composed of a housing part (2) with a plug-in receiving means (4) for one end of the pipeline, and of a radially elastic clamping ring (6) which is arranged in the housing part (2), exhibits a longitudinal slit (8) passing in the axial direction and has at least one inner, circumferential cutting edge (10) and an outer cone (12) which interacts with an inner cone (14) of the housing part in order to arrest the pipeline, the clamping ring (6) being subdivided into two resilient arms by means of a ring-profile weakening (16) formed in the region of the ring located diametrically opposite the longitudinal slit (8). In order to form the ring-profile weakening (16), the clamping ring (6) has, in this circumferential region and at least in a sub-region of its axial length, on the inside and outside, in each case one delimiting contour (18, 20) which runs in the form of an arc of a circle, as seen in the circumferential direction. The centre point (M1) of the radius of curvature (r1) of the outer delimiting contour (20) is offset in the direction of the longitudinal slit (8) relative to the centre point (M2) of the radius of curvature (r2) of the inner delimiting contour (18).

A connecting device (1) for the rapid and releasable 
connection of synthetic pipelines, comprising a housing part (2) 

having a plug-type receiver (4) for one end of the pipeline and 
a radially resilient clamping ring (6) which is arranged in the 

housing part (2), has an elongate slot (8) passing right through 
in the axial direction and has at least one inside peripheral 

cutting edge (10) and an external conical shape (12) which, in 
order to lock the pipeline, cooperates with an internal conical 

shape (14) of the housing part (2), the clamping ring (6) being 
divided into two spring arms (6a, 6b) by an annular-profile 

thinner portion (16) which is formed in an annular region 
diametrically opposite the elongate slot (8), for the formation 

of the annular-profile thinner portion (16) the clamping ring (6) 
possessing in this annular region and at least in a region of its 

axial length respectively on the inside and on the outside a 
delimiting contour (18, 20) which runs in an arc, as seen in the 

peripheral direction, the centre point (M
1
) of the radius of 
curvature (r
1
) of the outside delimiting contour (20) being 
offset relative to the centre point (M
2
) of the radius of 
curvature (r
2
) of the inside delimiting contour (18) in the 
direction of the elongate slot (8), characterized in that the 

outside delimiting contour (20) of the annular-profile thinner 
portion (16) is constructed as a cylinder surface (22) which - 

in dependence on its radius of curvature (r
1
) and on the offset 
(ΔM) of its curvature centre point (M
1
) from the curvature centre 
point (M
2
) of the inside delimiting contour (18) - in the 
peripheral direction extends to a greater or lesser extent in the 

direction of the elongate slot (8). 
A connecting device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cylinder surface (22) extends in the peripheral 

direction over an angular range of between 30° and 360°, relative 
to the centre axis of the clamping ring (6).  

 
A connecting device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cylinder surface (22) forming the outs
ide delimiting 
contour (20) of the annular-profile thinner portion (16) 

interrupts the external conical shape (12) of the clamping ring 
(6). 
A connecting device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cylinder surface (22) forming the outside delimiting 

contour (20) of the annular-profile thinner portion (16) lies 
within an annular portion (24) offset axially from the external 

conical shape (12).
