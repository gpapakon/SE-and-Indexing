<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closure for bottle-shaped containers (B), especially liquid containers, and is composed of a closure cap (1) having inner locking elements (V) which inversely match elements on the neck (HA) of the bottle-shaped container (B). According to the invention, the base (4) of the closure cap (1) takes the form of a sleeve (5) which is open at both ends and in the latter there is arranged, so as to be displaceable in an axially limited fashion, a pot-like closure bung (8) which has liquid outlet channels (6, 7) and has an outer diameter (D1) which is smaller than the inside diameter (D) of the closure cap (1). The at least one lateral outlet channel (6) on the closure bung (8) which is held in the closed position by means of a spring (9) is covered by the inner end region of the sleeve (5).
