<ABSTRACT>
Monomer peptide recognized by a humoral or cellular immune response introducing an auto-immune reaction in subjects infected by HIV-1 or 2, characterized in that it is selected in the group comprised particularly of SLWDQ, SLWDQSLK and DIISLWDQSLK, and in that it has, if desired, on the N terminal and C terminal side, from 1 to 5 other amino acids in a peptidic chain, and its multimers in linear sequence comprising from 2 to 6 monomer units, peptide, modified protein or protein fragment containing said peptide, peptide adjacent to said peptide, antibody, antiidiotypic antibody, medicament containing them and methods for treating AIDS.

the said peptide having, if desired, on the N-terminal
and C-terminal side, from 1 to 3 other amino acids in a

peptide chain, and also consisting of its multimers in
a linear sequence having from 2 to 6 monomer units, in

order to obtain a medicament intended to limit in humans
the autoimmune reactions induced by one of the viruses

HIV-1 and 2.

the said peptide having, if desired, on the N-terminal
and C-terminal side, from 1 to 3 other amino acids in a

peptide chain, and also consisting of its multimers in
a linear sequence having from 2 to 6 monomer units, in

order to obtain a medicament intended to induce in humans
a state of immunosuppression, for example in the

case of transplants, especially organ transplants.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2 of a peptide as
defined in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the

monomer peptide is of viral origin or is derived from
an immunoregulatory molecule.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2 of a peptide, a
protein fragment or a protein containing a peptide as

defined in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the said
peptide is modified by deletion, addition or modification

of one or more amino acids in order to lose its
epitopic character in subjects infected with HIV-1 or

HIV-2.
Use of a peptide having from 5 to 20 amino acids,
of viral origin, adjacent to one of the peptides

defined in Claim 1 in the viral sequence, and overlapping
on the C-terminal or N-terminal side either 1 or 2

amino acids of a peptide as defined in Claim 1 or 2, in
order to obtain a medicament intended to limit in humans

the autoimmune reactions induced by one of the viruses
HIV-1 and HIV-2 or a medicament intended to induce

in humans a state of immunosuppression, for example
in the case of transplants, especially organ transplants.
Use of a peptide as defined in Claim 1 comprising
the sequence SLWDQ, in order to obtain a medicament

intended to induce suppression of the immune reaction
in a subject.
