<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionSUBCOOLING SYSTEM FOR REFRIGERATION CYCLEThe government of the United States may have rights in this patent pursuant to Government Contract EPA-G-R-817111-01-0.Technical FieldThis invention pertains to an improved internal heat exchange system significantly reducing the energy consumption of refrigerator/freezer units that use nonazeotropic refrigerant mixtures as working fluids. Specifically, liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser of a multi-compartment refrigeration system is subcooled prior to entering the evaporator on the way to a compressor. The efficiency of subcooling is improved by placing the working fluid mixture in heat exchange relationship with the cold suction vapor on route from the evaporator to the compressor and in heat exchange relationship with the evaporating fluid in the evaporator over the length of the evaporator.Background ArtConventional refrigerator/freezer units employ a single refrigeration cycle to cool both the refrigeration and the freezer, which are maintained at sharply different temperatures. Such refrigeration systems typically include a condenser and a compressor, between which working fluid is circulated, the condenser and the evaporator being separated by at least one heat exchanger, and at least one evaporator. In certain systems, multiple heat exchangers and evaporators can be used.To conserve energy, and improve efficiency of the system. 

it is conventional to subcool the working fluid leaving the condenser, prior to entering the expansion valve or other means for expanding the gas flow at the entry to the evaporator. U.S. Patent 4,773,234, Kann. U.S. Patent 4,577,468, Nunn et al and U.S. Patent 4,285,205, Martin et al all disclose this type of subcooling, where the liquid leaving the condenser is passed in heat exchange with suction gas leaving the evaporator. A typical system, such as that described in Martin et al. is illustrated in Figure 1. The working fluid leaving the condenser passes, at point 100, in heat exchange relationship with a suction gas exhibiting the evaporator 102. The location of the heat exchange is not critical, save that it lie between the condenser and expansion valve 104, or similar expansion means, immediately upstream of the evaporator.Conventionally, working fluids for systems of this type employ a single refrigerant, such as R12. U.S. Patent 4,781,738, Fuiiwara et al. as well as others, employ nonazeotropic refrigerant mixture working fluids in systems of this type. In general, it is known that nonazeotropic mixtures

Claims
1. In a refrigeration system comprising a condenser and a compressor in fluid communication between which is situated an evaporator downstream of a means for expanding a nonazeotropic mixture refrigerant working fluid circulated within said system, the improvement comprising a subcooling system for subcooling working fluid leaving said condenser by directing said working fluid from said condenser to said expansion means through a fluid communication means in a first heat exchange relationship with a suction vapor leaving said evaporator and entering said condenser, and a second heat exchange relationship with working fluid evaporating in said evaporator, said second heat exchange relationship being downstream of said first heat exchange relationship and upstream of said expansion means.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein said fluid to be subcooled is circulated through said evaporator in a conduit within said evaporator, said evaporator being of the fin-tube design, said conduit having an external diameter less than the internal diameter of the tube of said evaporator.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein said system comprises a second evaporator located between said evaporator and said compressor, and said fluid to be subcooled is in heat exchange relationship with fluid evaporating in said second evaporator.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein said fluid to be subcooled is in heat exchange relationship with working fluid passing between said evaporators and suction gas leaving said second evaporator.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the vapor quality at the exit of said second evaporator is less than one.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the vapor quality at the exit of said second evaporator is less than one. 


 7. The system of claim 2, wherein said evaporator tube, and said conduit therewithin, are bent through at least one angle.
