<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the prevention of corrosion of metal 
surfaces in contact with boiler waters or their condensates. In the work, The Nalco Water Handbook, Second Ed. Frank N 
Kemmer, Editor Hc Graw Hill. 1987, Chapter 39 deals with the 
subject of treating boiler waters to prevent deposits and 
corrosion. A special problem in the treatment of boilers is the 
prevention of corrosion of the metal surfaces of the condensate 
return systems. Boiler water condensates are corrosive because they 
are contaminated with carbon dioxide and oxygen. These agents 
render the hot condensate corrosive and aggressive to such metals 
as iron, and copper. The most common method of preventing condensate corrosion is 
to treat the condensate with neutralizing amines to raise the pH of 
the condensate. For a discussion of the use of neutralizing amines 
to combat condensate corrosion, reference may be had to the Nalco 
Water Handbook, specifically page 39.55. This work and its 
description of boiler corrosion problems is incorporated herein by 
reference. These amines may be fed to the boiler feed water after 
deaeration, to the boiler steam drum or to the steam header. While 
these amines have given satisfactory results in preventing 
condensate corrosion they are falling in to disfavor due their 
relatively high level of toxicity. Until the present invention condensate inhibitors were usually 
used to prevent condensate corrosion only. The prevention of the  
 
corrosion of metal surfaces in contact with boiler waters has 
normally required the use of inhibitors different in kind from 
those used to prevent condensate corrosion. Typically, sulfites 
and hydrazine have been used to combat boiler water corrosion 
problems. Advances in the art of preventing the corrosion of metal 
surfaces of boilers and their condensate return systems would be 
afforded if there were available a condensate corrosion inhibitor 
having a low order of toxicity which would also protect metal 
surfaces in contact with boiler waters. Of further benefit would be 
an inhibitor as generically described which would be stable under 
conditions of the high pressures found in commercial boilers which 
range from as little as 15⊘ pounds per square inch (psi) up to as 
great as high as 15⊘⊘-2⊘⊘⊘ psi. These advances in the art are 
accomplished by using 1,3-imidazole as the inhibiting agent. 1,3-imidazole has been suggested as a corrosion inhibitor for 
mild steel in alkaline mine waters: see Subramanyam, ND. and 
Mayanna, S. M. "Azoles as
