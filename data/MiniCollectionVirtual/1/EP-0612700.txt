<ABSTRACT>
A large glass preform can be flame abraded and can have 
clear and smooth surface by using a method for flame abrading a 

surface of a rotating glass preform by an oxyhydrogen flame which 
moves along a length of the glass preform in which a movement 

velocity of the oxyhydrogen flame or a flow rate of oxyhydrogen of 
the oxyhydrogen flame is varied to conduct the flame abrasion 

treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for flame
abrading a glass preform. Particularly, it relates to a method for
flame abrading a glass preform wherein an ineffective part
is flame abraded and an unsintered part of the glass preform which
cannot be converted to a transparent one by a thermal treatment during
sintering a porous preform is converted to a transparent glass, when
the glass preform is flame abraded.Hitherto, as a method for preparing a high purity quartz
glass preform (hereinafter referred to as "glass preform"), a VAD
(Vapor Phase Axial Deposition) method, an OVD (Outside Vapor
Deposition) method and the like are known. This method comprises
depositing silica (SiO2) glass fine particles prepared by the hydrolysis
reaction of a SiCl4 raw material with the oxyhydrogen flame on an
outer surface of a rotating starting rod such as a silica rod, forming a
porous preform in an axial direction, and then converting the porous
preform to a transparent glass to prepare a glass preform for an optical
fiber. Since the resultant glass preform which is a transparent glass
has a surface having roughness of a few micrometers, the surface of
the glass preform is flame abraded to give a smooth surface and then
the glass preform is drawn and spun. Generally, since a lathe for the
flame abrasion is horizontal type, support rods are attached to both
ends of the glass preform, the support rods are fixed to the lathe by
means of chucks and then the glass preform is flame abraded with 
moving oxyhydrogen burners.Recently, in view of a lower cost of an optical fiber, the
preform has a large size by increasing a diameter and/or length of the
glass preform. In the case of such horizontal type lathe, when the
preform has a heavier weight and is supported by only the support rods,
there is a danger that one or both of the support rods may be broken
because of a high load. In order to solve this problem, a method
comprising holding the glass preform vertically is proposed (cf.
Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 228844/1991).When an ineffective part of the preform is
sufficiently heated so as to convert the ineffective part to a
transparent glass during the thermal treatment step (the sintering
step) for making a transparent glass in order to increase an effective
coefficient of utilization, there is a problem that the support rod is
elongated because of the preform weight so that the preform drops.
Therefore, the ineffective part cannot be completely converted to the
transparent glass during the sintering step
