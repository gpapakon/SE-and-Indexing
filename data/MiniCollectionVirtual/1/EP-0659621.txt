<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The pressure limiting device has, inter alia, a piston element which, in a sealed manner, separates a switching chamber supplied with the outlet pressure from a pressure reduction chamber connected to a pressure relief space. In the case of a leak between the switching chamber and the pressure reduction chamber, the entire pressure-medium system containing the pressure limiting device can become depressurised. 2.2 The invention proposes to arrange a restrictor (12) in the connection between the pressure reduction chamber (16) and the pressure relief space. This makes it possible to maintain the full outlet pressure at the outlet (7) or at least an emergency pressure in the entire pressure-medium system, despite the said leak. 2.3 A frequent area of use for the invention is in vehicle brake systems.

<CLAIMS>
Pressure-limiting device having

a) an inlet (2) connected to a pressure-generating system (1),
b) an outlet (7) connected to at least one consumer circuit (8; 34),
c) an inlet valve (3, 4) connecting the inlet (2) to the outlet (7),
d) an outlet valve (4, 6) connecting the outlet (7) to a pressure-reducing chamber
(15) connected to a pressure discharge space,
e) an actuating spring (11),
f) a displaceable piston member (10, 17), which effects the opening and closing of
the mentioned valves (3, 4 and 4, 6) and which separates and seals off an

actuating chamber (16) connected to the outlet (7) from the pressure-reducing
chamber (15), with
h) the piston member (10, 17) being acted upon, in the direction of the opening of
the outlet valve (4, 6) and the closing of the inlet valve (3, 4), by the pressure in

the actuating chamber (16) and, in the direction of the opening of the inlet valve
(3, 4) and the closing of the outlet valve (4, 6), by the actuating spring (11),
characterised in that
i) there is arranged in the connection between the pressure-reducing chamber (15)
and the pressure discharge space a throttle (12), which is so dimensioned that at

least an emergency pressure can be maintained in the pressure medium system
even when there is a major leak between the actuating chamber (16) and the 

pressure-reducing chamber (15) of the pressure-generating system (1) even
when the delivery capacity is low.
Pressure-limiting device according to claim 1, the inlet (2) of which is connected to
the pressure-generating system (1) via at least one second consumer circuit (21;

31) having a pressure level exceeding the pressure level of the consumer circuit (8;
34) connected to the outlet (7) of the pressure-limiting device (5),
characterised in that

there is arranged between the second consumer circuit (21; 31) and the inlet (2) of
the pressure-limiting device (5) a non-return valve (22; 32) having a pre-determined

opening pressure, the opening pressure of which non-return valve (22; 32) is equal
to the pressure difference between the pressure levels of the consumer circuits (22;

32).
