<ABSTRACT>
The occurrence of malfunction on the reproduction side 
is avoided by preventing a scrambled signal from being 

coincided with a reserved word in the signal when a scramble 
process is carried out in order to release a transmission 

signal to specific users. The scramble process includes at 
least one of methods of (1) bit-inverting specified codes of 

the transmission signal code by code, (2) limiting bits to 
be scrambled from a specified position in the transmission 

signal, and (3) limiting codes to be scrambled to specific 
codes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a signal processing apparatus 
for performing a scramble process in transmission or storage 
of digital coded signals and a descramble process in 
reproduction of the coded signals in such a manner that 
permits only authorized users who are given with a decoding 
procedure to reproduce the coded signals. Scramble systems have been employed for pay TV 
broadcasts and the like. A scramble system for digital 
signals was introduced in a technical report by Nezu and 
other researchers titled as "A scramble system-M-for 
communication satellite television", ITEJ Technical Report 
Vol. 15, No. 14, pp. 1 to 6, in which descriptions are made 
on the scramble of sound signals. With the conventional 
scramble system, a signal processing apparatus comprises an  
 
exclusive OR circuit for adding a random number to an input 
signal, a random number generator for generating the random 
number in response to a scramble key, and a controller 
disposed between the exclusive OR circuit and the random 
number generator to control the random number value to be 
added to the input signal. The input signal is bit-inverted 
by logical exclusive addition to a pseudo random number from 
a pseudo random number generator in the exclusive OR circuit 
thereby to become a random-numbered, or scrambled, signal. 
In this case, the controller controls the bit inversion rate 
within the input signal by changing whether or not the 
random number is added to the input signal at an appropriate 
rate. The decoding thereof may be made by logical exclusive 
addition of a random number from the random number generator 
to the scrambled signal again. The pseudo random number 
generated by the random number generator is determined in 
response to the scramble key, and only a decoder having the 
scramble key can achieve decoding. With the signal 
processing apparatus for performing scramble and descramble 
as conventionally, under the condition that the 
synchronization on both the scramble side and descramble 
side can be made comparatively easy, that is, under the  
 
condition that the scrambled position within the data on the 
descramble side can be detected easily independently of the 
bit pattern of data, even if data to be scrambled are made 
of random numbers, the synchronization can be easily taken 
on the descramble side, thus being capable of reproducing 
the data correctly. With the conventional structure, however, in such a 
communication system that data are received on the reception 
side from the midway
