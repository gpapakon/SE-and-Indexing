Method of coating electrically conductive 
substrates, in which 


(1) the electrically conductive substrate is immersed 
in an aqueous electrodeposition paint which contains at 

least one cathodically depositable synthetic resin and 
crosslinked polymer microparticles, 
(2) the substrate is connected as cathode, 
(3) a film is deposited by direct current on the substrate, 
(4) the coated substrate is removed from the 
electrodeposition paint, and 
(5) the deposited paint film is baked, 
 
characterized in that the crosslinked polymer microparticles 

contained in the aqueous electrodeposition 
paint can be prepared by reacting 


(A) a compound which contains on average more than 1.0 
epoxide group per molecule, or a mixture of such 

compounds, and 
(B) a compound which contains not only a group reactive 
towards epoxide groups but also at least one 

ketimine or aldimine group in the molecule, or a 
mixture of such compounds 
 
to give a non-crosslinked intermediate product (C), 

which still contains on average at least one epoxide 
group per molecule, and dispersing this intermediate 

product in the presence of a Brönsted acid in an 
aqueous medium. 
Aqueous electrodeposition paints, containing at 
least one cathodically depositable synthetic resin and 

crosslinked polymer microparticles, characterized in 
that the crosslinked polymer microparticles can be 

prepared by reacting 

(A) a compound which contains on average more than 1.0 
epoxide group per molecule, or a mixture of such 

compounds, and 
(B) a compound which contains not only a group reactive 
towards epoxide groups but also at least one  

 
ketimine or aldimine group in the molecule, or a 

mixture of such compounds 
 
to give a non-crosslinked intermediate product (C), 

which still contains on average at least one epoxide 
group per molecule, and dispersing this intermediate 

product in the presence of a Brönsted acid in an 
aqueous medium. 
Method or electrodeposition paints according to 

Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that component (A) 
contains on average 1.5 to 3.0 epoxide groups per 

molecule. 
Method or electrodeposition paints according to 
one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that component 

(B) is a compound which contains both a secondary amino 
group and at least one ketimine group in the molecule. 
Method or electrodeposition paints according to 
one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the non-crosslinked 

intermediate product (C) still contains on 
average 1.0 to 4.0 epoxide groups, preferably 1.0 to 

2.0 epoxide groups, per molecule. 
Process for the preparation of an aqueous 
dispersion of crosslinked polymer microparticles, 

characterized in that 

(A) a compound which contains on average more than 1.0 
epoxide group per molecule, or a mixture of such 

compounds, and 
(B) a compound which contains both a group which is 
reactive towards epoxide groups and at least one 

ketimine or aldimine group in the molecule, or a 
mixture of such compounds, 
 
are reacted to give a non-crosslinked intermediate product 

(C) which still contains on average at least one 
epoxide group per molecule, and this intermediate 

product is dispersed in an aqueous medium in the presence 
of a Brönsted acid. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that component (A) contains on average 1.5 to 3.0 

epoxide groups per molecule.  
 
Process according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that component (B) is a compound which 

contains both a secondary amino group and at least one 
ketimine group in the molecule. 
Process according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the non-crosslinked intermediate 

product (C) still contains on average 1.0 to 4.0 
epoxide groups, preferably 1.0 to 2.0 epoxide groups, 

per molecule. 
Aqueous dispersions of crosslinked polymer 
microparticles, characterized in that they can be 

prepared according to one of Claims 6 to 9.
