<ABSTRACT>
An orthotic device suitable for the investigation and treatment 
of joint malfunctions includes a first member (10) rotatably 

connected to a second member (14). Two adjustable limits (41, 42) 
restrict the relative rotation of the members, (10, 14) and over-ride 

means (71, 72, 73) are provided to allow rotation beyond the limits 
(41, 42). Means (73, 50, 51) are also provided for locking the first 

(10) and second (14) members in at least one fixed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to orthotic devices for the 
treatment of patients with walking disabilities. The device is 
suitable for use by patients with a variety of problems, but 
is particularly concerned with the treatment of victims of cerebral 
palsy. Cerebral palsy victims suffer from motor control problems 
which vary considerably from patient to patient. Consequently 
surgeons have great difficulties in deciding on the best type 
of walking aid for any particular patient. The best aid can 
often be decided only by trial and error. This involves the 
patient's trying in sequence a plurality of aids each allowing 
a different range of movement. This is not only time consuming 
for the surgeon and his assistants but also results in tiredness 
of the patient such that several sessions may be necessary for 
a successful diagnosis of appropriate equipment be made. Furthermore 
the condition of a patient can be expected to change with 
time, with a result that changes in equipment must be made. 
With presently available equipment this requires a repeat of 
the above described test procedure. Orthotic devices are known with articulating joints where 
the degree of articulation in either direction can be adjusted 
by stops and in which at least one of the stops can be overridden 
to, for example, allow a standing patient to adopt a sitting 
position. An example is UK-A-2168106. The device described in 
this Application, however, has no locking position, and for cerebral 
palsy victims in particular it is desirable that an orthotic walking 
aid should be lockable in a standing position, a sitting position 
or, preferably, both standing and sitting positions. There is, therefore, a need for an orthotic device which enables 
adjustment of the various movement parameters to be made whilst 
fitted to a patient, which can be set to a preferred adjustment 
when this has been optimised, and which can be adjusted in situ  
 
to allow for changes in a patient's condition. According to the present invention an orthotic device for 
the investigation and treatment of joint malfunctions includes 
a first member rotatably connected to a second member, means for 
allowing relative rotation of the first and second members over 
a range between two adjustable limits and over-ride means for 
allowing relative rotation of the first and second members beyond 
these limits, and locking means for locking the first and second 
members in at least one fixed position. A particular device according to the invention is used for
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An orthotic device, for the investigation and treatment of 
joint malfunctions, including a first member rotatably connected 

to a second member, means for allowing relative rotation of the 
first and second members over a range between two adjustable limits 

and over-ride means for allowing relative rotation of the first 
and second members beyond these limits, and locking means for 

locking the first and second members in at least one fixed position. 
An orthotic device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the adjustable 
limits can be adjusted whilst the device is fitted to a patient. 
An orthotic device as claimed in Claim 1 or in Claim 2 wherein 
the over-ride means and the locking means can be operated by a 

wearer of the device. 
An orthotic device is claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 
wherein the adjustable limits are determined by two stop screws 

whose position in one of the first or second members can be varied 
along an arc whose centre is the centre of relative rotation of 

the first and second members. 
An orthotic device as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the other 

of the first and second members includes plunger means which can 
be entended into the arc between the two stop screws and which 

can be retracted to override the limits. 
An orthotic device as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the plunger 
is offset with respect to an axis about which it can be rotated 

out of alignment with the arc and into alignment with at least 
one slot into which it can be positioned to lock the first and 

second members. 
A walking aid including two orthotic devices, each as claimed 
in any one of Claims 1 to 6, one for each hip of a patient. 
A walking aid as claimed in Claim 7 wherein the orthotic devices 
can, whilst the aid is being worn by a patient, be adapted to have 

fitted, and can have fitted thereto a cross-linking device. 
A walking aid as claimed in Claim 8 wherein the cross-linking 
device is of the type including two crossed bowden cables. 
A walking aid as claimed in Claim 9 wherein the cross-linking 
device is fitted to the walking aid by securing a bowden sheath 

attachment member to one of the first or second members of each orthotic 
device, by positioning a bowden cable attachment member between 

the first or second members and by constraining the bowden cable 
attachment device to move with the other of the first and second 

members. 
A walking aid as claimed in Claim 10 wherein the bowden cable 
attachment device can be constrained to move with the other of 

the first and second members in a position corresponding to a 
walking attitude of the patient. 
A walking aid as claimed in Claim 10 or in Claim 11 wherein, 
the bowden cable attachment device can be constrained to move 

with the other of the first and second members in a position corresponding 
to a sitting attitude of the patient. 
A walking aid as claimed in any one of Claims 7 to 12 including 
at least one of a spring, a damper and a gas strut. 
An orthotic device substantially as herein described with 
reference to Figures 2 to 7 of the accompanying drawings. 
An orthotic device substantially as herein described. 
A walking aid substantially as herein described with reference 
to Figures 1 to 9 of the accompanying drawings. 
A walking aid substantially as herein described.
