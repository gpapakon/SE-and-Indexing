<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antifungal agent 
containing a novel triazole compound as an active ingredient. JP-A-1-275566 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means 
an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") 
describes that a compound structurally similar to the 
triazole compound according to the present invention has 
fungicidal activity for agricultural use, but there is found 
no mention of antifungal activity for medical use. In the course of study of novel antifungals, the 
present inventors have found that a novel triazole compound 
represented by formula (I) exhibits superior antifungal 
activity at a low dose level. The present invention provides a triazole compound 
represented by formula (I): 
wherein R₁ and R₂, which may be the same or different, each 
represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a trihaloalkyl 
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, with proviso that R₁ 
and R₂ do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom ; R₃ 
represents an aromatic heterocyclic group or a phenyl group 
substituted with a substituent selected from a haloalkoxy 
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a nitrile group, a 
hydroxymethyl group, a carboxyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl 
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a morpholinocarbonyl 
group, a formyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted imino 
group, an iminoether group, a substituted alkenyl group, an 
alkylthio group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenylthio 
group, and an aromatic heterocyclic group; and X represents 
S, SO₂, -(CH=CH)n-, wherein n represents 1 or 2, -C≡C- or a 
single bond. In formula (I), the halogen atom includes a fluorine 
atom, a bromine atom, and a chlorine atom; the trihaloalkyl 
group includes a trifluoromethyl group and a trichloromethyl 
group; the lower alkoxycarbonyl group includes a 
methoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, an 
isopropoxycarbonyl group, and an sec-butoxycarbonyl group; 
the haloalkoxy group includes a trifluoromethoxy group, a 
1,1,1-trifluoroethoxy group, and a 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoropropoxy 
group; the substituted or unsubstituted imino group includes 
an imino group, a phenylimino group, and a halogen-substituted  
 
phenylimino group; and the heterocyclic aromatic 
group includes a 1,2,4-triazolyl group, a thiazolyl group, an 
isothiazolyl group, a thienyl group, a furyl group, a pyridyl 
group, an imidazolyl group, a pyrazinyl group, an oxazolyl 
group, an isoxazolyl group, a thiazolyl group, a thiadiazolyl 
group, a pyrazolyl group, an imidazopyrimidyl group, a 
benzothiazolyl
