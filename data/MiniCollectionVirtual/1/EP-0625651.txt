<ABSTRACT>
The intention is to provide a method for monitoring the dynamic load and/or wear status of a transmission during operation, particularly a low-backlash planetary transmission, and to use it to indicate and/or influence the operating behaviour of the transmission. For this purpose, the differences in angular position which arise between the transmission input and output shafts during operation are measured together with the respectively associated transmission load states as actual values and compared with the corresponding desired values by means of an evaluation programme. Using the results of the comparison, it is possible in the case, for example, of actuating mechanisms used for industrial robots, to perform a control correction of the drive motor to compensate for transmission errors due to wear of the transmission. With such a method, load monitoring and the display of wear in general are furthermore possible.

Method of monitoring the dynamic load and/or wear state 
of a gear system, in particular a low-backlash planetary gear 

system, characterised in that the differences in rotational 
angle adjusted during operation between gear input and output 

shaft together with the respective associated gear load states 
are measured as actual values and compared with the 

corresponding set values via an evaluation program. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
comparison between the actual value and set value takes place 

while allowing for the determination of the actual value at 
the actual value determination points with measured 

instantaneous temperatures in each case. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2 for keeping the 
predetermined adjustment path, for example for a robot, 

constant independently of gear wear, characterised in that the 
result of comparison between determined actual values and 

predetermined set values is used as a gauge of the wearcompensating 
adaptation of the control pulses of an actuator 

defining the adjustment paths. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the dynamic rotational angle deviations 

occurring as variation in transmission between gear input and 
output shaft are evaluated. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims in an 
electric gear drive motor, in particular servomotor, 

characterised in that the rotational angle of the shaft on the 
gear input side is that of the motor input shaft.  

 
Device for carrying out the method according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that a respective 

electric rotational angle locator (4, 5) which transmits its 

respectively determined values to an evaluating unit is 
provided on the input and output shaft (1 and 2) of the gear 

system (3) to be monitored. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that, on 
one of the force-transmitting parts of the gear system there 

is arranged a deformation meter (8) for defining the 
deformation of this part produced by the gear torque loading 

and in that the measured values are supplied to the evaluating 
program for the actual value/set value comparator as a gauge 

of the torque loading of the gear system. 
Device according to claim 6 or 7 for carrying out a 
method having the characterising features of claim 4, 

characterised in that variations in torque angle of the output 
shaft (2) in particular are determined by a seismic transducer 

(9) arranged thereon such as an acceleration transducer and 
are supplied to the evaluating program as an electrical 

signal.
