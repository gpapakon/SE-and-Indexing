<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of determining a viable microbial cell count in a sample 
solution with an enhanced detection sensitivity is provided, comprising filtering the 

sample solution through a filtration membrane having hydrophobic properties to entrap 
microbes within hydrophobic barriers; applying thereto a fine spray of ATP extracting 

reagent to extract a luminescent ingredient from the microbes; applying thereto another 
fine spray of liquid luminescence-inducing reagent for the luminescent ingredient 

extracted to allow the ingredient to emit luminescence; and measuring the level of the 
luminescence, using a competent means for measuring the luinescence level. The 

microbes and the two types of reagents are locally concentrated due to the hydrophobic 
properties of the membrane and thus the sensitivity is greatly enhanced, permitting instant 

counting in the case of large microbes, and decreased culture time for smaller bacterial 
microbes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rapid, convenient, and highly sensitive method
of determining a viable count or number of viable microbes in industrial water, raw
materials, intermediates, and products processed in the food and beverage,
pharmaceutical, cosmetic and microelectronic industries.In various industrial applications, such as food and beverage and pharmaceutical, it
is well-known that controlling viable microbes in industrial water; raw materials,
intermediates, and products is of extreme importance. Quality control of industrial water
is also a matter of utmost concern in the electronics industry, and numbers of viable
microbes in the water must be monitored at every stage of processing, consequently,
determining the viable count is an essential requirement in these industries.In order to determine a viable count, a conventional, so-called "standard agar
plate" method prescribed under Food Hygiene Testing Guide is generally employed. This
process, however, is rather cumbersome, and, moreover, requires much time for obtaining
the results, causing a significant delay in judgment on the existence of microbes or the
number thereof. This delay impacts the production and/or shipment steps, thus causing a
considerable loss of time and space. Accordingly, there has been a need in these
industries to develop a more rapid and convenient method.In an attempt to meet this need, a variety of methods for rapid detection have been
proposed, among which involve a bioluminescence method (see Japanese Patent
Application Kokai Nos.2-57,197 and 2-163,098, and Haruta, M.: "Facilitation,
Automatization, and Acceleration of Food Microbial Testing (orig. in Japanese)", Science 
Forum, pp.58, Japan (1985). In this method, a small volume of sample solution is
collected in a small test tube in the case of solutions having a sufficiently large viable
count, or, in the case of a smaller count, the sample solution is filtered through a filter to
entrap and concentrate the microbial population thereon. This step is followed by
removing the filtration membrane, immersing it in a small volume of, for example, sterile
water to suspend the microbes therein, and then taking a portion of the resulting
suspension into a small test tube. An extracting reagent is then added to the test tube with
a luminescence-inducing reagent to determine the count of adenosine triphosphate
(hereinafter referred to as "ATP") contained in the microbes, through use of a
luminometer, whereby the viable count is calculated. When the sample solution
