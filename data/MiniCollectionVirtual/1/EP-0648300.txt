<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for handling material, especially soil, the device comprising a bucket (1) of a machine having a grinding device (2) for the material fitted thereto, the grinding device comprising at least two essentially parallel shafts (3) which are set at a distance from each other and rotatable in synchronization, the shafts comprising grinding members (4) for the material, whereby the grinding members (4) of two adjacent shafts overlap each other, the bottom of the bucket (1) comprising an outlet opening (5) for the handled material. According to the invention the grinding members are comprised of numerous discs (4) which are set at a distance from each other on each shaft (3), the peripheral surfaces of the discs comprising projections, whereby a notch is provided between two adjacent projections. In addition, the bucket (1) comprises a loosening device (6) for the material fitted between the grinding device (2) and the outlet opening (5), the loosening device comprising at least two essentially parallel shafts (7) which are set at a distance from each other and rotatable in synchronization and which comprise aeration blades (8) for loosening the ground material obtained from the grinding device (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for handling material,
especially soil, the device consisting of a bucket of a machine
having a grinding device for material fitted thereto, the
grinding device comprising at least two essentially parallel
shafts which are at a distance from each other and rotatable in
synchronization, the shafts comprising grinding members for the
material, whereby the grinding members of two adjacent shafts
overlap each other, the bottom of the bucket comprising an
outlet opening for the handled material.The materials to be handled include, in particular, different
soils such as compost, peat, and waste soil as well as different
waste materials.The bucket of the above described type which is especially
intended to be used as the bucket of an excavator and for
grinding soil, is known from FI patent application 902469. The
grinding members on the shafts of the grinding device in this
known bucket construction consist of radial blades welded on the
shafts which mix and grind the soil to be handled. A
disadvantage of this construction is that the blade can be
twisted by stones or the like resulting in the twisted blade
colliding with the blade on the adjacent shaft, whereupon the
bucket must be stopped and removed for repair. Another
disadvantage of the described construction is that roots or the
like can become tangled with the blades,resulting in jamming the
device. The handled soil would not be very loose either, nor
would it be sufficiently high-quality for demanding uses.Screening plants are also well known which handle compost using
large drum screens. Such plants are very expensive and require
separate transporting equipment if they are to be transferred
from one place to another.The purpose of this invention is to provide a device which
avoids the above-described drawbacks of known devices, and the 
purpose of the invention is namely to provide a device which is
very reliable and comprises a minimum number of parts which wear
and are apt to break, and which, in addition to effectively
screening and grinding the material to be handled, also renders
it a loose form.An important object of the invention is thus to provide a device
which produces very high-quality soil which suits demanding uses
very well.These objects can be realized by the device according to the
invention, the main characteristics of which are disclosed in
the appended Claims.The invention is based on the realization that a bucket
construction is provided comprising a grinding device which
includes effective and
