<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a benzamide
derivative. More particularly, it relates to a
benzamide derivative useful as drugs.The proportion of patients with indefinite
complaints such as abdominal distension, heartburn,
nausea and vomiting among those with gastrointestinal
diseases has recently increased steadily and now
reaches 60% or above.Most of these indefinite complaints are caused by
the functional anomaly of the digestive tract. For
example, it is known that a patient with epigastric
indefinite complaints such as chronic gastritis is in
a state of delayed gastric emptying, while a patient
with hypogastric indefinite complaints such as
irritable bowel syndrome including abnormal evacuation
and abdominal pain as the cardinal symptom is in a
state of intestinal hyperanakinezia.It is ascertained that stress and anxiety are
causative of any indefinite complaint, and in this
sence, it is not too much to say that indefinite
complaint is one of modern diseases.Dopamine antagonists, musculotropic agents for 
regulating the movement of smooth muscles and
acetylcholine release accelerators are now used in
order to ameliorate the above gastrointestinal
indefinite complaints. However, dopamine antagonists
cause potent adverse reactions such as parkinsonism,
so that they must be used carefully; musculotropic
agents for regulating the movement of smooth muscles
cause adverse reactions such as constipation
unfavorably; and acetylcholine release accelerators do
not effectively act as an antiemetic or anxiolytic,
thus being unsatisfactory.Under these circumstances, the inventors of the
present invention have set about making studies for
the purpose of developing a drug which is efficacious
in treating all types of patients with gastro-intestinal
indefinite complaints without causing any
potent adverse reaction and exhibits a depressant
activity against anxiety which is nearly always found
as one of the background factors of such patients.As a result of the studies, it has been concluded
that the above requirements can be fulfilled by a drug
exhibiting both a serotonin (hereinafter abbreviated
to "5-HT3") antagonism and an acetylcholine
(hereinafter abbreviated to "ACh") release 
accelerating activity. Therefore, further studies
have been made in order to find a compound exhibiting
both the activities at a well-balanced activity ratio
to find out that the object can be attained by using
a benzamide derivative represented by the
following general formula (I) or (II) or a
pharmacologically acceptable salt
</DESCRIPTION>
