An improved auxiliary seat designed to be fitted in a vehicle and 
capable of retracting into its floor (10) where there is recessed a 

cavity (11) which has an opening (111), a base (112) and side walls 
(113) which together define an enclosed space (110) capable of 

accommodating the seat and of being closed by a moveable cover (12) 
when the seat is positioned therein, this seat (20), which comprises 

in particular a base portion (21) with a reinforcement (211) having 
side rails (2111) and exterior and interior transverse rods (2112) and 

a back portion (22) with a reinforcement (221) which has lateral 
vertical columns (2211) and upper and lower transverse crosspieces 

(2212), being characterised in that it comprises two side arms (23), 
each with a free end (231) designed to rest on the base (112), one 

anchored end (232) connected by a pivot (2320) to a lateral vertical 
column (2211) of the back portion (22) and an intermediate member 

(233) connected by a pivot (2330) to a side rail (2111) of the base 
portion (21), a joint (24) which defines a swing axis (240) for the 

seat (20) and the cover (12) and which is comprised of a fixed 
portion (241) immovably attached to a side wall (113) of the cavity 

(11) near to its opening (111) and of a moveable portion (242) which 
supports the reinforcement (221) of the back portion (22) and the 

cover (12), and retaining means (25) co-operating in particular with 
the interior transverse rod (2112) of the reinforcement (211) of the 

base portion (21) in order to keep the seat in an unfolded position 
where it is capable of seating a passenger, after swinging from its 

retracted position in the cavity and outside of the same, these pivots 
(2320, 2330) being positioned in such a way that, when the seat 

moves from its unfolded position into its retracted position, the base 
portion (21) and the back portion (22) are moved forward mutually 

perpendicular to the direction of the swing axis (240). 
A seat as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the pivot (2320) 
is positioned near to the upper crosspiece (2212) and the pivot (2330) 

is positioned near to the interior rod (2112).  
 
A seat as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the retaining 
means (25) comprise at least one support (251) in the form of a hook 

(2511) supported by the moveable portion (242) of the joint (24). 
A seat as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the hook (2511) is 
flexible and U-shaped. 
A seat as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
retaining means (25) comprise at least one stop (252) positioned in 

the cavity (11) and co-operating with at least one free end (231) of 
one arm (23). 
A seat as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the stop (252) 
comprises an angle iron (2521) mounted in the cavity (11) and a stud 

(2522) mounted at the free end (231) of the arm (23). 
A seat as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
cover (12) is made of two separate sections. 
A seat as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that one of the sections 
of the lid (12) is a plate (121) resting on the reinforcement (221) of 

the back portion (22) and the other section is a small moveable plate 
(122) mounted on the floor (10) near to the opening (111) of the 

cavity (11) and at the opposite end to the joint (24) so that it is 
able to enter the cavity (11). 
A seat as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
opening (111) of the cavity (11) is bordered at least partially by a 

rabbet (114) capable of accommodating the cover (12) which rests 
there locally when the seat (20) is in the retracted position. 
A seat as claimed in one of claims 8 and 9, characterised in that the 
plate (121) is able to rest in the rabbet (114) and in that either the 

plate (121) or the small plate (122) is fitted with a catch (123) to lock
