<ABSTRACT>
A microelectronic device is fabricated on a first substrate (40), and transferred to a second substrate (58). The first substrate (40) has a silicon etchable layer (42), a silicon dioxide etch-stop layer (44) overlying the etchable layer (42), and a single-crystal wafer (46) overlying the etch-stop layer (44). A microelectronic circuit element (48) is formed in the wafer (46) of the first substrate (40). The wafer (46) of the first substrate (40) is attached to an aluminum oxide temporary substrate (52), and the etchable layer (42) of the first substrate (40) is etched away down to the etch-stop layer (44) to leave a primary device structure. The etch-stop layer (44) may optionally be processed to remove all or a part of the layer. An exposed surface (56) of the primary device structure is fixed to the second substrate (58), and the temporary substrate (52) is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microelectronic
devices, and, more particularly, to such a device
moved from one substrate to another during
fabrication.Thin-film microelectronic devices are
fabricated on a substrate, typically a thin piece of
a single-crystal material such as silicon. The
microelectronic circuitry is formed in the substrate
by a combination of steps such as deposition,
implantation, film growth, etching, and patterning.
In these steps, patterned layers of metals,
semiconductors, and insulators are created on or near
the surface of the substrate with the physical
arrangements, interfaces, and structures required for
individual circuit components and the electrical
leads that extend between them.The substrate performs important roles in the
fabrication and use of the microelectronic device.
The lattice matching between the substrate and the
layer deposited upon the substrate strongly
influences the structure, orientation, and
operability of that layer in the device. The
chemical composition (i.e., doping) of the substrate
can also play a major role in the operability of the
device.Microelectronic devices are normally assembled
together with other components into higher-level
structures and packages. The substrate used for the
microelectronic device also plays an important role
in product performance after the subsequent assembly
of the device into such higher-level products. These 
complex electronic structures are often heated and
cooled during storage and service. For example,
sensors often must be operated at cryogenic
temperatures, necessitating the cooling of the final
assembled structure of sensor element and electronic
device to such low temperatures. If the substrate of
a particular microelectronic device has a
substantially different coefficient of thermal
expansion than other structures with which it is
assembled to make the final product, thermal
expansion stresses and strains are created. If the
thermal expansion mismatch is too large, the thermal
stresses and strains may adversely affect the
operation of the microelectronic device, and, in the
extreme case, cause a mechanical failure of the
structure.A great deal of effort has been devoted to
selecting combinations of materials and structures
that permit fabrication of microelectronic circuitry
having the required structure and electronic
performance in the fabricated microelectronic device,
and at the same time minimize adverse effects of
thermal expansion mismatch in the final structure.
This search for operable combinations is
