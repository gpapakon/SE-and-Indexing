<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water lance blower for cleaning heat exchangers, especially of a combustion chamber heating surface in steam boilers, which is pivoted with an outlet in the wall of the boiler and pivotably suspended at its rear section. In order to ensure that the blower may move in all directions at the outlet without becoming soiled and for the jet to describe a precisely defined path on the opposite wall of the boiler, a flange is fitted at the outlet of the blower pipe (1) which is fitted on a segment of a universal joint (3) which is secured in the combustion chamber wall (4), the rear section of the blower pipe (1) is arranged in a guide (5) which can be moved horizontally at the top on a vertical spindle (6) and at the bottom on a horizontal spindle (7, 8) and the guide consists of a housing (9) which is fitted so as not to rotate on the vertical spindle (6) and has a fork-like attachment (10) at the side in which is fitted a universal-joint-like cage (11), the interior of which takes the form of a sleeve (12) and holds the blower pipe (1) inside it so as to be axially movable.

<CLAIMS>
A water lance for cleaning a furnace wall (4) in steam boilers by means of a blast pipe (1) 
with a swivelling mouth mounted in the combustion chamber wall of the steam boiler and 

with its rear end suspended in such a manner that it can be moved in all directions,
characterized in that
 
the mouth of the blast pipe (1) in the combustion chamber wall (4) is provided with a flange, 

which is mounted to the combustion chamber wall (4) on a gimbal (3) in the known art, that 
the rear end of the blast pipe (1) is mounted to a guiding device (5), itself attached to a 

vertical spindle (6) to allow height adjustment, with both the top and bottom of the vertical 
spindle (6) attached to horizontal spindles (7; 8) to allow horizontal adjustment, that the 

guiding device (5) consists of a non-rotatable housing (9) which is seated on the vertical 
spindle (6) and supports a fork-shaped receiver (10), along the lateral axis of which a 

rotatable retainer (11) is mounted, in the interior of which a rotatable sleeve (12) is provided, 
into which the blast pipe (1) is mounted to allow axial adjustment. 
A water lance as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the vertical spindle (6) is 
surrounded by a stationary sheath tube (22) with a longitudinal keyway, that a threaded nut 

(23) is attached to the vertical spindle (6) by means of a feather key, wherein the feather key 
(2) is guided along the longitudinal keyway, the feather key projecting out of the keyway and 

supporting a bearing bush (13) onto which the casing (9) is mounted. 
A water lance as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the casing (9) and the 
receiver (10) are made from one piece, that the feather key (2) is T-shaped with its flange 

(24) fastened to the casing (9) from the outside and with its shaft (25) passed through the 
casing (9) and into the threaded nut (23). 
A water lance as claimed in claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the vertical spindle (6) is 
driven by a gear motor. 
A water lance as claimed in claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the vertical spindle (6)  
 

and the horizontal spindles (7; 8) are surrounded by an expansion bellows or by a protective 
flat spiral spring (14). 
A water lance as claimed in claims 1 to 5 
characterized in that
 the horizontal spindles 
(7; 8) are attached at their ends to a front housing (18) and a rear housing (19), that the upper 

spindle (7) is driven by a gear motor (17) and the lower spindle (8) is connected to the upper 
spindle (7) via a chain in the rear housing (19).
