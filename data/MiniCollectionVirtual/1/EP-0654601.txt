<ABSTRACT>
The design and construction of past injector 
assemblies having an injector sleeve manufactured from a 

deformable material used the deforming characteristics of 
the injector sleeve to form a combustion seal separating a 

combustion chamber from a cooling liquid jacket. 
Additionally, the injector sleeve was generally used in 

conjunction with a resilient means to form the coolant seal 
between the cooling liquid jacket and a fuel injector. 

Deforming the injector sleeve to produce the combustion 
seal made it difficult to remove during inspections and 

maintenance schedules and virtually impossible to reuse. 
The present invention overcomes these problems by providing 

an injector sleeve (54) manufactured from a relatively non-deformable 
material which is used in conjunction with a 

plurality of seal rings (76) to establish only a coolant 
seal between the cooling liquid jacket (28) and a fuel 

injector (112). An injector cone (84) has a tapered lower 
portion (86) which is seated in a frusto-conical portion 

(50) disposed within a cylinder head (18) to establish an 
independent combustion seal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an injector
assembly for use in an internal combustion engine and more
particularly to the sealing capabilities of the injector
assembly.It is well known in the art to utilize an injector
assembly which has an injector sleeve manufactured from a
deformable material such as brass or copper. Corresponding
to its deformable nature, the injector sleeve can be swaged
or pressed under pressure to form a combustion seal.
Additionally, the injector sleeve is normally used in
conjunction with a resilient means to form a cooling liquid
seal.An example of an injector assembly is disclosed in
US-A-3334617, wherein an injector-receiving copper tube
extends through a coolant water jacket. Leakage between
the coolant jacket and a combustion chamber due to thermal
distortion of the combustion chamber wall is prevented by
providing an annular ring on the tube which engages an
annular sealing surface in a lower wall of a cylinder head
extending parallel to the plane of the wall. The sealing
force on the ring is obtained by clamping the injector
against an annular surface of the tube interior adjacent
the position of the annular ring. The tube end is deformed
into a counterbore extending upwardly from the combustion
chamber surface of the lower wall to positively retain the
tube in the lower wall and the clamping force positively
seals the joint. Additionally, the injector tube includes
a cylindrical upper portion having an outwardly directed
flange at the upper end, which engages an o-ring seal
carried in a counterbored portion of an opening in the
upper wall of the cylinder head to prevent leakage of
coolant from the water jacket. As with conventional
injector assemblies, the construction disclosed in 3334617
utilizes a deformable injector tube which is deformed
during installation by the clamping force of the injector 
in order to retain the injector tube in the cylinder head
and to form a combustion seal. Periodically, however, the
injector tube and surrounding structures or seals may need
to be inspected during normal maintenance schedules. In
order to remove the injector tube, it would have to be
destroyed because the deformation of the injector tube
would make it virtually impossible to remove the injector
tube intact. The destruction of the injector tube could
allow fragments of the injector tube to enter the
combustion chamber leading to possible failure of the
engine. Moreover, the injector tube once removed, would
always have to be replaced at an additional cost.
