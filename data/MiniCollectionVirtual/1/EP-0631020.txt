<ABSTRACT>
The aerator (1) has a body (4) having openings (5) 
formed therein and containing meshes (6) and a perforated 

plate (7). A monolithic convex diaphragm (8), defining a 
wall (8a), has holes (8b,8c) formed in a central region 

thereof and a perimetric (8d) ultrasonically welded to a 
seat formed in the plate (7). The convexity of the 

diaphragm (8) is oriented in a fluid flow direction, 
whereby retained particles are collected at the base of the 

perimeter of the diaphragm (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
aerator for liquids.It is known that so-called aerators are widely
used, which are installed at the outlet of liquid conveyance
ducts and particularly of ducts conveying water to
sinks, with the specific purpose of breaking the stream
of fluid into parallel threads so as to make the jet that
exits into the atmosphere perfectly cylindrical.Known aerators include, according to a very
common embodiment, a body usually installed in a ring
associatable with the end of the duct that conveys the
liquid and suitable to contain various elements, such as
a pack of metal meshes and a perforated plate. A filter
is furthermore installed at the end of the body on the
liquid inlet side. The filter has the purpose of retaining
the impurities present in the liquid, and has the shape
of a mesh that covers the entire cross-section of said
body.In order to limit the flow-rate of the liquid conveyed
by the duct at the end of which the aerator is installed,
so as to save on the consumption of said liquid,
in the known art it is possible to place on said filter a cap
which is kept in position by means of an appropriate gasket
and has a solid wall with a central hole, so that the
passage section of the liquid is reduced and the intended
purpose is thereby achieved.The resulting complicated configuration, however,
is clearly disadvantageous in terms of costs and
from a functional point of view, since reassembly problems
can occur every time the user disassembles the
ring containing the aerator to clean the aerator itself.There are also aerators which have, at the end
of the body containing the pack of meshes, a disk provided
with a central hole for limiting the flow-rate, with
the exclusion of any filtering action. However, impurities
entrained by the liquid become trapped below said disk
and cannot be removed in any way, causing rapid loss
of efficiency of the device.Examples of aerators as mentioned above are
available in the prior document EG-A-625 084.A further type of aerator,
is known from US-A-4 657 186.A still further type of aerator is known from the
prior document US-A-2 633 343 which discloses a fluid mixing
device for producing a stream of liquid containing air bubbles
and which has an upstream disc functioning to prevent dirt from
clogging the downstream disc and also to assure a more even distribution
of liquid to the downstream disc.An aim of the present invention is therefore to
provide an improved aerator for liquids which has an extremely
simple structure and allows
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Aerator for liquids, comprising a containment body (4), and
located superimposed inside said body, from the water outlet

towards the water inlet end thereof, meshes (6), a perforated plate
(7), and a diaphragm (8) arranged at the end of the said body on

the liquid inlet side and having at least a filtering function,

characterized in that
 said diaphragm (8) is formed so as to have
a solid wall (8a) only partially provided with liquid passage holes (8b, 8c)

arranged exclusively and grouped in a selected region which is either a central region,
at a median band or at sectors, so that said diaphragm.

(8) performs a dual function, comprising both the filtering and
and a limiting fluid flow function. 
Device according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the wall (8a) of the diaphragm
(8) is convex toward the flow of liquid.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the diaphragm (8) is
made of plastics and has a monolithic structure including

the convex wall (8a) provided with holes
(8b, 8c) in the top region, delimited by a perimetric

edge (8d) for connection to a seat formed at the end
of said body (4).
Device according to claim 1 or 3, 
characterized in
that
 said body (4), said plate (7) and said diaphragm
(8) are made of plastics.
Device according to claims 1, 2 or 4, 
characterized
in that
 said diaphragm (8), said perforated plate (7)
and said body (4) can be coupled together by welding

to lorm an assembly.
