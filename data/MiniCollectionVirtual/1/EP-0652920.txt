<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antistatic agent which
can be used for suppressing electrification of articles in
the fields of electronic elements, components or equipment,
electrical parts or equipment, analytical instruments
during the production, use or analysis of the
articles; a method for suppressing electrification of these
articles by using the antistatic agent or a composition
thereof; a method for observation or inspection of these
articles by using the antistatic agent; and the
electrification-suppressed article by using the antistatic
agent or a composition thereof. More particularly, the
present invention relates to an antistatic agent or a
composition thereof which can be used for suppressing
electrification of an article due to accumulation of
electrical charges under irradiation with charged particle
beams; a method for suppressing electrification of an article
by forming an electroconductive film comprising the
antistatic agent on the article; a method for observing or
inspecting an article under irradiation with charged particle
beams while suppressing electrification of the article; and 
the article perse having an electroconductive film
comprising the antistatic agent.Electronic elements, electronic components,
electronic equipment, electrical parts, electrical equipment,
analytical instruments tend to be electrically
charged during production or use (inclusive of analysis).
For example, when these articles, particularly insulating
ones, are irradiated with charged particle beams, such as
electron beams and ion beams, electrical charges are
accumulated in the articles to cause electrification. If
this occur in the production of semiconductors, IC, LSI and
photomasks, in which a fine pattern is
formed by using charged particle beams, the incident charged
particle beams would be influenced by the field of the
accumulated charges and deviate from their track. It tends
to follow that the positional precision of pattern formation
is deteriorated, causing deformation or positional deviation
of the pattern and reduction in alignment precision.If electrification occurs in observation or analysis
with an analytical instrument utilizing charged particle
beams, such as an electron microscope and an electron tester,
the observed image may be distorted or become invisible, or
the precision of the tester is deteriorated.The above-mentioned various problems arising in the
production or use of such articles as electronic elements, 
electronic components, electronic equipment, electrical
parts,
