<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals, 
such as cows, comprises a milking robot (19) and a computer 

system. This computer system is of such a configuration that 
an animal that has recently calved can be milked 

automatically and/or to the livestock farmer's option one or 
more times more frequently in a 24 hour's period than the 

average number of times the other animals of the herd to 
which the recently calved animal belongs, are milked.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction or a similar arrangement for automatically milking animals.Such a construction is known from EP-A-0 551 957.In this construction the computer system comprises a programme to ensure that the animals, which are at the beginning of a lactation period are given priority for entering the milking parlour over animals which are not at the beginning of the lactation period.The invention has for its object to provide an alternative construction.According to the invention this is achieved by the features as defined in claim 1.The stimulation means can, for example, be disposed in the lying boxes and feed stations present in the construction, whilst, using the stimulation means an animal present in a lying box or in a feed station can be stimulated by light or audio signals or by applying electric shocks to go to the milking robot.Since the animals can freely report at the milking box, lured thereto for example, because they can get concentrate there, it must be checked whether a sufficiently long period of time has elapsed after the previous milking turn. Put differently, a selection must be effected of the animals reporting at the milking box, more specifically in that sense that only those animals whose previous milking turn was a sufficiently long period of time before, are passed to the milking box. With the aid of the animal identification system constituted by the animal identification sensor present in this selection box and connected to the computer system and by the transponder to be worn by the animal, it can be decided on the basis of the file stored for this an imal in the computer system whether the animal is to be sent back to the shed of the construction or must be allowed to go to the milking box.In an advantageous embodiment, each of the boxes can be provided at one side with at least two doors, through which an animal can consecutively and sideways move from one box to the other. In a preferred embodiment the doors will be pivotally arranged approximately halfway the long side of a relevant box, and a door will have an end which in the closed state curves towards the midway point of the box. As a consequence thereof, by moving the exit door of the rear box and the entrance door of the front box to a first opened state, a connection between the rear and the front box will be established, so that an animal present in the rear box can be guided to the first box via this passage. By keeping the entrance door of the front box closed and by moving the

<CLAIMS>
A construction or a similar arrangement for automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a milking box (2) with a milking robot (19) the construction including two boxes (1, 2) which are contiguous to each via their ends, the first (1) of these boxes being arranged for selecting and/or supplying animals with concentrate and the second (2) being arranged as said milking box, each box (1, 2) including an animal identification sensor which is connected to a computer system and, in combination with a transponder to be worn by each of the animals forms an animal identification system, with which it is possible to update in the computer system which animal is present in the milking box (2), the computer system comprising a file in which it is recorded when an animal has been milked for the last time, when an animal has calved last, when the lactation period of an animal has started, how much milk it yields in each milking turn, and in which it is automatically recorded how many times said animal can be milked in each 24 hours' period and with what interval, wherein said animal is milked one or more times more frequently per 24 hours' period than the average number of times the other animals of the herd to which the animal which has recently calved belongs, and that stimulation means controlled by the computer system are present for summoning the animal after the time interval between consecutive milking turns determined and recorded by the computer system has elapsed, to go to the milking robot (19).
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it includes lying boxes and feeding stations in which the stimulating means are disposed, with the aid of which stimulating means an animal present in a lying box or in a feeding station can be stimulated by light or audio signals or by the application of electric shocks to go to the milking robot.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each of the boxes (1, 2) has at one side at least two doors (8 to 11) through which an animal can consecutively go sideways from one box to the other.
A construction as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the doors (8 to 11) are pivotally disposed approximately halfway the long side of a relevant box.
A construction as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 in the closed state a door (8 to 11) has one end (12 to 15) which is rounded-off towards the midway point of the box (1, 2).
A construction as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the exit door (10) of the rear box (1) and the entrance door (9) of the leading box (2) allow in a first opened state an animal present in the rear box (1) to go to the leading box (2).
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the exit door (10) of the rear box (1) forces in a second opened state, in which the entrance door (9) of the leading box (2) remains closed, an animal present in the rear box (1) to return to the shed area of the construction.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 7, 
characterized in that
 transversely of the longitudinal direction of the two boxes (1, 2) in the region where they connect up with each other a partition (16) is present which is movable in the transverse direction and is moved away from the boxes (1. 2) when an animal is to pass from the rear (1) to the leading box (2) and is moved towards the boxes (1. 2) when an animal is denied access from the rear box (1) to the leading box (2) and is to return to the shed area of the construction.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 8, 
characterized in that
 each box (1, 2) includes an automatically controlled feed trough (17, 18).
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
, with the aid of the animal identification system and the information stored in the computer system about the animal present in the rear box (1), it is decided whether the animal is given access to the leading box (2) or is returned to the shed area of the construction.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the rear box (1) is not only arranged as a selection box, but also for massaging the udder of an animal, cleaning the animal and supplying it with concentrate.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it is arranged as a loose housing.
