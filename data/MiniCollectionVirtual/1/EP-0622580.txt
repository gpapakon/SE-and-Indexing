<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates mainly to an insert (12), to a connection for a tubular pipe (2) including such an insert, especially a T-connection (11), to the method for producing such a connection for a tubular pipe and to improved tooling for implementing this method. The implementation of an insert according to the invention applied to the tubular pipe allows it to be overmoulded with elastomer. The present invention applies mainly to the production of connections in tubular pipes made of elastomer conveying fluids into an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle. In particular, a connection according to the present invention is particularly advantageous for immersing a thermal contact in the cooling fluid (coolant) piped through a tubular pipe to the outlet or inlet of a heat exchanger of a cooling circuit of such an engine.

claims, characterised in that the endpiece comprises a

collar (13), and in that the tubular conduit (19) of
said endpiece is threaded or has a threaded metal insert

(25), notably a brass insert.

it comprises means (23) for guiding the flow of the

overmoulding material, notably ribs arranged on the
bearing surface (15).
Insert according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the bearing surface (15)

comprises spacers (20), notably hemispherical in shape,
capable of ensuring the relative positioning of the

insert in relation to the outer surface of a tubular
conduit (2) during the overmoulding operation.
T-shaped connection on an elastomeric tubular
conduit of axis A1 comprising a tubular conduit (19) of

axis A2 perpendicular to the axis A1, characterised in
that it comprises an insert (12), according to any one

of the preceding claims, the bearing surface (15) of
which is embedded in an elastomer overmoulding (14).
Connection according to claim 8, characterised in
that the geometry and hardness of the elastomer of the

overmoulding (14) and the geometry of the insert (12)
are adapted to provide a resistance to torques around

the axis A2 greater than or equal to 24 Nm.
Connection according to claim 8 or 9, characterised
in that the elastomer overmoulding (14) is in the form

of a stud.
Connection according to claim 8 or 9, characterised

tubular conduit (2), a bearing surface (15) of an insert 

(12) in which through-holes (18) have been provided,
said insert comprising a tubular conduit (19) forming an

endpiece, one end of said tubular conduit (19) which
forms an endpiece opening out on said bearing surface

(15) opposite the perforation in the tubular conduit
(2);
