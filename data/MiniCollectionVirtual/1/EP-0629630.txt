<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phosphoric diester 
which has a UV (ultraviolet) rays absorbing group and which is 
useful as an active component of anti-suntan or anti-sunburn 
cosmetic compositions, a method of preparing the phosphoric 
diester, and cosmetic compositions containing the phosphoric 
diester. Recently, it has been found that ultraviolet rays are 
deeply involved in the mechanism of the onset of skin diseases 
such as skin cancer, suntan/sunburn, and aging of the skin. 
The increase in UV dose caused by the destruction of the ozone 
layer, which has now become a controversial issue, raises the 
problem of the possibility of harm by ultraviolet rays. In view of the foregoing, protecting the skin from UV 
rays is desired, and accordingly, various cosmetic 
compositions such as anti-sunburn compositions, skin-care 
compositions, foundations and similar compositions which 
contain UV shielding substances have been put on the market. Ultraviolet rays are divided into three groups: long-wavelength 
UV rays (UV-A; 320 to 400 nm), medium-wavelength UV 
rays (UV-B; 290 to 320 nm) and short-wavelength ultraviolet 
rays (UV-C; up to 290 nm). Among these, UV-A and UV-B both of  
 
which reach the surface of the earth have been found to be 
harmful to the skin. In order to protect the skin from these 
harmful UV rays, many UV shielding substances have been 
developed. For example, inorganic compounds such as titanium oxide, 
iron oxide and zinc oxide, and oil-soluble organic compounds 
such as 4-t-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane are known as UV-A 
shielding substances. Substances known to provide shielding 
from UV-B include p-aminobenzoic acid, salicylic acid, 
methoxycinnamic acid, and benzophenone derivatives. They are 
processed in various manners for enhancing the UV-shielding 
property or for providing a suitable material useful as 
cosmetic compositions. For example, the former are made into 
fine particles or ultrafine particles, subjected to 
hydrophobic surface treatment, or combined with other 
substances, and the latter are made into derivatives such as 
metal salts. In processing to enhance UV-absorbing effects, safety to 
the skin and retention on the skin for long periods are 
especially important. With regard to safety, consideration must be given not 
only to the skin-irritating effect of the UV absorbing agent 
itself but also to irritation of the skin caused when the UV 
absorbing agent absorbs light. In order to solve this 
problem, an attempt has been made to avoid direct
