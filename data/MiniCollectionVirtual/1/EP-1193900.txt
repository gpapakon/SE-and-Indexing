<ABSTRACT>
A time division duplex synchronization system transmits a synchronization signal (L) with a delay (D) relative to the start of the synchronization interval with a guard period (G) so that the transmit power can rise to the maximum value and be received at adjacent base stations.

Method of transmitting a synchronisation signal during a synchronisation time period of a telecommunication system by mobile stations of the time division duplex (TDD) type, where the data are transmitted in frames made up of time periods, said synchronisation signal including a synchronisation sequence, a method consisting of transmitting the synchronisation sequence Sync with a delay D relative to the start of said synchronisation time period, a method 
characterised in that
 said delay D is greater than the time necessary for the transmission power to pass from the minimum power to the maximum power and is such that said synchronisation sequence is centred in the time period between the end of the transmission of the data of the time period preceding the synchronisation time period and the start of transmission of the data of the time period following said synchronisation time period.
Method of transmission according to the preceding claim, carried out in a transmission system for which each time period has a duration 
D
it
,
 for which a guard period of each time period it has a duration d, the length of said synchronisation sequence being 
L
, 
characterised in that
 said delay D is given by the following equation:

Method of transmission according to one of the preceding claims, carried out in a transmission system of the W-CDMA TDD type, for which each time period has a duration of 2560 chips, for which a guard period of each time period has a duration of 96 chips, 
characterised in that
 the length of said synchronisation sequence is 2047 or 2048 chips, and 
in that
 said delay D is 208 chips.
