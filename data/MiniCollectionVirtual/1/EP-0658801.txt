<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention a film transporting
apparatus for a film processing system and a film
processing system using the apparatus, and more
particularly to a film transporting apparatus
including a pair of frame members pivotably connected
to each other to be opened and closed, transport means
provided to each of the frame members, a light
emitting portion provided in one of the frame members,
a light receiving portion provided in the other frame
member and constituting an optical sensor together
with the light emitting portion and positioning
engaging portions provided respectively to the frame
members and coming into engagement with each other in
association with a pivotal movement of the frame
members to a closed state, and the invention relates
also to a film processing system using a film
transporting apparatus of the above-described type.With the above film transporting apparatus, as
used in a film processing system such as a
photographic printing system for printing an image
recorded on a film onto a print paper, the apparatus
functions to transport the film while detecting film
image information such as a DX code identifying a type
of the film, or a position of a perforation by means
of a light-transmission type optical sensor.A typical conventional construction of a film
transporting apparatus is shown in Figs. 41 and 42.
In this, in order to facilitate e.g. a cleaning
operation of a film transport passage, a pair of frame
members 100, 101 are pivotably interconnected to each
other to be opened and closed. These frame members
100, 101 respectively include guides 100a, 101a acting
as transport means. Then, as illustrated in Fig. 42,
the film is transported when the pair of frame members
100, 101 are closed.The frame members 100, 101 respectively include
either a light emitting portion 102a or a light
receiving portion 102b of an optical sensor 102 for
detecting film information. When the frame members
100, 101 are closed, the light emitting portion 102a
and the light receiving portion 102b together
constituting the optical sensor and disposed in
opposition other must be precisely fixed in position
relative to each other. In this respect, when the frame members 100, 101
are closed, positioning engaging portions 103a, 103b
come into engagement with each other to effect the
above-described positioning. However, since the
frame members 100, 101 are pivoted relative to each
other to be opened and closed, in order to prevent the
positioning engaging portions 103a, 103b from being
locked to each other
