<ABSTRACT>
A method of increasing libido in post-menopausal 
women comprising administering to a female 

human in need of treatment an effective amount of a 
compound having the formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Due to the advancements in medical science,
along with education, the quality and length of life have
both been increased. As a result, the population, as a
whole, is living longer. As such, situations which have
been present but not in great numbers are becoming more
numerous and recognized.One of those situations which has been present
but possibly not given enough weight is sexuality in old
age. While there has always been some thought that old
people are incapable of engaging in sexual activities,
which is somewhat supported by a definite decline in
sexuality for both sexes as they get older, sexual
activity among the elderly cannot be ignored. Therefore,
problems associated with such activity also can not be
ignored.While the male, from the early and middle years,
has a relatively steady decline in sexual capacity and
activity, the same cannot be as convincingly said about
women. There are reports that the sexual capacity of the
female does not change much until late in life. (Kinsey,
A.C., et al., Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,
Saunders, PA., pg. 353 (1953)). In particular, libido
decreases substantially in a considerable percentage of
cases after the menopause (Lauritzen et al., Estrogen
Therapy the Benefits and Risks, 3rd International Workshop
on Estrogen Therapy in Geneva, October 20-21, 1977,
Frontiers of Hormone Research, Vol. 5, pg. 10 (1978)).
This belief is supported by Pfeiffer, E., et al., Terminus
of Sexual Behavior in Middle and Old Age, Journal of the
American Geriatric Society, pg. 2151-2158 (1972), and
Pfeiffer et al., Sexual Behavior in Middle Life, American
Journal of Psychiatry, 128, 1262-1267 (1972). In the
Pfeiffer studies, a much greater decline in both sexual
activity and interest among women between the ages of 45 
and 71 was found as compared to men the same age, and the
most dramatic change took place between 50-60 years of age,
which is, of course, generally the period during which
women experience menopause or are post-menopausal. In the
age group of 66-71, 50% of women said they had no or little
sexual interest compared with 10% of men in the same age
group.While there has been no direct link between
declining estrogen levels and declining sexuality, it has
been stated that hormonal changes following a natural
menopause, and certainly following surgical menopause, may
contribute to the sexual decline in a portion of women.
Exactly how menopause contributes to the loss of libido is
not understood, yet seems fairly evident. (Bancroft, Human
Sexuality and Its
