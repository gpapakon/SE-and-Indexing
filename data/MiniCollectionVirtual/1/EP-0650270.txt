<ABSTRACT>
A satellite-based communication system (10) providing high rate transfer of data 
between linked terminals (11, 12). The system (10) comprises a plurality of user 

terminals (VSAT's) (111, 12) that are linked by and that communicate with each other 
by way of a satellite-based relay system (13). A network control center (14) provides 

configuration signals that control the satellite relay system (13) and coordinate linking 
of terminals (111, 12) to each other. Frequency division multiplexing uplinks are used 

from the terminals (111, 12) and the network control center (14) to the satellite relay 
system (13). Time division multiplexing are used on downlinks from the satellite relay 

system (13) to the terminals (11, 12) and the network control center (14). Each user 
terminal (111, 12) comprises a data compression and decompression circuit (22) , a 

transceiver (23), and an antenna (25) for transmitting and receiving data to and from the 
satellite relay system (13). The satellite relay system (13) comprises a satellite (30), a 

wide area antenna (35), a plurality of receive antennas (32, 24), a plurality of transmit 
antennas (31, 33), and a signal processor (36). The wide area antenna (35) is provided 

for communicating command and control signals between the user terminals (11, 12) 
and the network control center (13). The plurality of receive antennas (32, 34) operate 

in a first frequency band and produce a first plurality of beams that cover a service area. 
The plurality of receive antennas (1332, 34 receive time domain modulated data from 

the user terminals (11, 12). The plurality of transmit antennas (31, 33) operate in a 
second frequency band and produce a second plurality of beams that cover the service 

area. The plurality of transmit antennas (31, 33) transmit frequency domain modulated 
data to the user terminals (11, 12). The signal processor (36) demodulates the time 

domain modulated data received from a user terminal (11), routes the demodulated data 
so that it is transmitted to a second user terminal (12), remodulates the data to provide 

frequency domain modulated data, and transmits the frequency domain modulated data 
to the second user terminal (12). Video cameras (21) and monitors (24) are coupled to 

the user terminals (11, 12) to provide for video teleconferencing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to satellite communication systems, and
more particularly, to a high data rate satellite communication system that provides for
data, voice and video communication between individuals.The past several decades has seen the development of communications systems
that provide for the real-time distribution of information on a global scale. The development
of such global communication systems has evolved along several paths that use
either ground-based or satellite-based communication. Satellite-based systems have
been employed for many years to distribute voice, data and video signals for global
broadcasting of news and sporting events, for example. With the advent of newer high
power satellite systems and technology, direct broadcast television systems are available
that provide for broadcasting of television signals from up to 100 stations using a
single satellite. Individuals install an antenna and a satellite receiver that receives the
broadcasts directly by way of the satellite and display them on a television monitor.In order to provide for more personal communication or teleconferencing
between individuals, companies such as AT&T, for example, have developed a video
telephone system that employs a small (3-4 inch) television monitor in combination
with a conventional telephone. The video telephone system typically uses fiber optic
links to provide a sufficient bandwidth to carry the video along with the voice signals.
However, this type of system does not have enough bandwidth to provide for full
motion video. Furthermore, this system is relatively expensive per installation.No currently available system has provided for relatively affordable personal
teleconferencing between individuals. Such affordability involves three aspects. The 
system should have a low utilization cost. Currently deployed satellites can only
support about 100 VSAT links at 1.5 MBPS. It would be desirable to have a system
that provides on the order of 100 times this capability in order to provide for more cost-effective
delivery of service. Also, personal communication systems should have
relatively low terminal costs. The currently available systems have not exploited
available VCR cameras and low loss compression CODEC standards, which help
provide for a low cost system. Finally, personal communication systems should have
low installation costs.Thus there is a need for a communication system that provides for the communication
and distribution of full motion video, voice and data
