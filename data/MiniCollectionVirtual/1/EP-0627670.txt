<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
automatic document conveying device adapted to an image 
processing machine such as an electrostatic copying 
machine or an image reader. It is now widely accepted practice to 
provide image processing machines such as electrostatic 
copying machines and image readers with an automatic 
document conveying device in order to automatically 
handle documents in the operations for copying images 
or reading images. Prior literatures that disclose 
automatic document conveying devices can be represented 
by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications Nos. 
91747/1978 and 118551/1985 and Japanese Utility Model 
Laid-Open Publication No. 49348/1986. The image processing machine such as the 
electrostatic copying machine or the image reader is 
equipped with a housing on which a transparent plate is 
disposed to place thereon documents that are to be 
processed. On one end edge of the transparent plate is 
mounted a document placing position restricting member 
against which the one end of the document is usually 
caused to be abut. The automatic document conveying 
device is comprised of a document table, a document 
introducing passage that extends from the document 
table to the one end edge of the transparent plate, a 
document receiving tray, and a document delivery 
passage that extends from the other end edge of the 
transparent plate to the document receiving tray. In 
the automatic document conveying device are further 
disposed document sending means that sends plural 
pieces of documents placed on the document table onto  
 
the document introduction passage piece by piece, 
document introducing means that introduces onto the 
transparent plate the document sent onto the document 
introduction passage, document conveying means for 
conveying the document along the transparent plate, and 
document delivery means that discharges the document 
onto the document receiving tray through the document 
conveying passage, the document being conveyed onto the 
document delivery passage by the document conveying 
means. Two document receiving trays are disposed in 
many cases, i.e., a first document receiving tray and a 
second document receiving tray. In these cases, the 
document delivery passage includes a common passage 
that extends from the other end edge of the transparent 
plate, a first branched passage that extends from the 
down stream end of the common passage to the first 
document receiving tray, and a second branched passage 
that extends from the downstream end of
