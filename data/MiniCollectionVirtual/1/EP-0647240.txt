<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a continuous ultrasonic method and apparatus for breaking the carbon-sulfur (C-S), sulfur-sulfur (S-S), and if desired, carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in a vulcanized elastomer. It is well known that vulcanized elastomers having a three-dimensional chemical network, cannot flow under the effect of heat and/or pressure. This creates a huge problem in the recycling of used tires and other elastomeric products. Through the application of certain levels of ultrasonic amplitudes in the presence of pressure and optionally heat, the three-dimensional network of vulcanized elastomer can be broken down. As a most desirable consequence, ultrasonically treated cured rubber becomes soft, thereby enabling this material to be reprocessed and shaped in a manner similar to that employed with uncured elastomers. The apparatus relates to the ultrasonic reactor (20) (e.g. an extruder). The reactor (20) is connected to an ultrasonic die assembly (10); the die assembly (10) consists of a transducer portion (12), which includes a power converter (14) and booster (13), connected to a horn portion (15), the assembly being supported by mounting bracket (18), and being attached to the reactor (20) through an adaptor portion (19). The reactor (20) includes a barrel (22), fed through hopper (24), the screw (26) within the barrel portion being driven by a drive (25), energized by a motor (28) (not shown). The horn portion (15) includes a die portion (16) through which the devulcanized elastomer being extruded is forced at a pressure shown by a pressure gauge (21). The ultrasonic generator (10) of the ultrasonic die of the invention, movably attached by mounting bracket (18) through adaptor legs (19) to a reactor (20). The reactor (20) is surrounded by a heating jacket (42). Vulcanized material is fed into die (16) through reactor bore exit (36) of exit bore diameter (dr) and into die inlet bore (38) of diameter (di). The vulcanized material is moved under pressure toward die exit bore (37) and leaves through die inlet bore (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved apparatus and method for continuous
recycling of vulcanized elastomers and thermosets. More particularly, this invention
relates to a continuous ultrasonic method for breaking the carbon-sulfur (C-S), sulfur-sulfur
(S-S), and if desired, carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in a vulcanized elastomer.It is currently estimated that about 200,000,000 used tires are produced annually.
After the useful lifetime of these tires has expired, they are commonly dumped in waste
disposal sites, but frequently are discarded on vacant land and in lakes and rivers because
the used tires have no value and, in fact, cost money to dispose of properly.In years past, it was possible for waste disposal sites and reclaiming plants to burn
the tires and recover the metal or to dump them at a landfill. However, with increasing
public awareness of ecology and the state of the environment, both the State
Environmental Protection Agencies and the U.S. Government Environmental Protection
Agency, have sought to eliminate this form of air and land pollution.The most common traditional method for handling waste materials has been to
simply dump the waste on designated land areas thereby creating large and often
hazardous dumps in which fires are frequent and runoff into water sources is routine. Not
only are these dumps eyesores, they are environmental hazards to both the air and water.
It is of no little consequence that while dumps or landfills have often been the cheapest
short term way of handling waste material, the land which can be used for this purpose
is rapidly running out This is particularly true in the highly urbanized areas of the
industrialized countries. This traditional method of disposing of waste does not allow for
the recovery of materials.A particular problem is found in the disposal of rubber based products, such as
automotive tires, hoses and belts, all of which are comprised of natural or synthetic rubber
reinforced with other materials such as metal belts and fibrous cords. These products 
have very little use after they have performed their original and/or primary task and
therefore have generally discarded. It is acknowledged tat a certain number of tires are
used to build retaining walls, guards protecting boating and similar things where resistance
to weathering is desirable. However, a far greater number of tires, belts and hoses are
simply discarded to become eyesores and breeding grounds for insects and other pests.
Burying is particularly ineffective since these materials
