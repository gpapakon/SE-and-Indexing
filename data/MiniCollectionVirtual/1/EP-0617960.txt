<ABSTRACT>
A novel use of the compound of the formula 

wherein R₁ is hydrogen atom or lower alkyl and R₂ is hydrogen 
atom or phosphoric acid group, or a pharmacologically acceptable 

salt thereof for preventing and treating cataract. The 
compounds of the formula (I) and pharmacologically acceptable 

salts thereof of the present invention inhibit initial changes 
in the lens, such as vacuolation and trochoidal change, and 

almost completely inhibit a decrease in the amounts of reduced 
glutathione and cysteine in the lens, so that they are 

advantageously used for the prevention of the onset and progress 
of cataract.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical use of a 
compound of the formula (I) to be mentioned later. 
More 
particularly, the invention relates to the use of 
a compound of pyridoxal (or pyridoxal-5-phosphate) 
and cysteine (or its alkyl ester) bonded thereto, or 
a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof for 
preventing and treating cataract. Cataract is a disease in which an eyeball lens becomes 
opaque to result in a lowered eyesight. It is developed in 
humans and other animals as well. For example, an oral 
administration of naphthalene to a house rabbit, which makes a 
dependable model for human in examining pharmacological action 
of an anticataract agent, results in vacuolation in and 
trochoidal change (speichen) of a lens, which are prodomes of 
cataract, and the amounts of reduced glutathione and cysteine in 
the lens are found to decrease at this point. Therefrom an expectation follows that the inhibition of 
such initial changes in the lens and the inhibition of a 
decrease in the amounts of reduced glutathione and cysteine in  
 
the lens at the aforementioned stage will result in effective 
prevention of the onset and progress of cataract. The present inventors have conducted intensive studies with 
the aim of finding a compound capable of effectively preventing 
the onset and progress of cataract by way of the inhibition of 
the changes in the lens and the inhibition of the decrease in 
the amounts of reduced glutathione and cysteine in the lens. As 
a result, they have found that a compound of pyridoxal (or 
pyridoxal-5-phosphate) and cysteine (or its alkyl ester) bonded 
thereto or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof can 
satisfactorily achieve the object and completed the invention. Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of 
a compound of the formula 
 
wherein R1 is hydrogen atom or lower alkyl and R2 is hydrogen 
atom or phosphoric acid group (-PO3H2), (hereinafter referred to 
as the Compound) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt 
thereof for the preparation of an anticataract agent.  
 The Compound to be used for the anticataract agent of the 
present invention has, as depicted by the foregoing formula, a 
chemical structure wherein pyridoxal (or pyridoxal-5-phosphate) 
and cysteine (or its alkyl ester) are condensed. The lower alkyl for R1 is preferably straight chain, 
branched chain or cyclic and has 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples 
thereof include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, 
n-butyl, tert-butyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl,
