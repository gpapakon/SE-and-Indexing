<ABSTRACT>
A photosensitive composition for volume hologram 
recording used for recording an interference fringe produced by 

the interference of laser beams or lights having excellent 
coherence as a fringe having a different refractive index, the 

composition comprising: 

(a) a radical polymerizable compound having a 9,9-diarylfluorene 
skeleton, which is liquid at a normal temperature; 
(b) a compound having compatibility with the 
component (a), which is selected from the group consisting of a 

cationic polymerizable compound, a radical polymerizable 
compound having no 9,9-diarylfluorene skeleton and a 

plasticizer; and 
(c) a radical photopolymerization initiator which is 
sensitive to laser beam having a specific wavelength or light 

having a specific wavelength and excellent coherence to 
polymerize the component (a); 
   wherein an average refractive index of the 
component (a) is larger than that of the component (b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive
composition for volume hologram recording, and a process for
producing a volume hologram using the same. More particularly,
it relates to a photosensitive composition for volume hologram
recording affording a hologram having excellent diffraction
efficiency, wavelength selectivity, refractive index modulation
and transparency, and a process for producing a volume hologram
by which a hologram can be produced easily using the same.A hologram is obtained by recording a wave front of
object light as an interference fringe which is formed by
interfering two kinds of lights having the same wavelength
(object light and reference light) on a photosensitive material.
When light having the same condition as that of the original
reference light is irradiated to the hologram, a diffraction
phenomenon due to the interference fringe is arisen, and the
same wave front as that of the original object light can be
reproduced.The hologram can be classified into some kinds
according to a recording form of the interference fringe.
Recently, the so-called hologram for recording the interference
fringe according to a difference in refractive index in the
interior of a recording layer has been applying for the use such
as three-dimensional display, or optical element 
because of it's high diffraction efficiency and excellent
wavelength selectivity.As a photosensitive material for recording such a
volume hologram, those comprising silver halide or gelatin
dichromate which have hitherto been used in the fields of art are
popular. However, these are not suitable for manufacturing the
hologram industrially because wet development and complicated
developing/fixing treatment are required. Further, there is a
problem that the resulting image after recording disappears due
to moisture absorption.In order to overcome the above problem of
conventional technique, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,658,526 and
3,993,485 suggest to prepare a volume hologram only by a
simple dry treatment using a photopolymer. The hologram due to
the photopolymer is estimated to proceed by a formation
mechanism studied in "APPLIED OPTICS", B.L. Booth, Vol. 14, No.
3, PP 593 - 601 (1975); and W. J. Tomlinson, E.A. Chandross et
al., Vol. 15, No. 2, PP 534 - 541 (1976). However, these
techniques could not hardly compete with the above-described
technique in view of refractive index modulation which is
particularly important performance.Improved techniques thereof are proposed in, for
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,942,102 and
