<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating composition 
for use in preventing the attachment of organisms to the 
surfaces of structures submerged in seawater. Antifouling paints employing an organotin copolymer and 
forming a coating film which gradually dissolves away in 
seawater are excellent in the ability to prevent the attachment 
of marine organisms to the surfaces of ship bottoms, etc., but 
the use thereof is restricted in recent years because of the 
problem of sea pollution. As a coating composition for eliminating the sea 
pollution problem is widely used an antifouling paint employing 
rosin as a soluble resin. Antifouling paints employing 
polymers containing various hydrolyzable groups incorporated 
therein have also been proposed. However, these antifouling 
paints all have not been put to wide practical use. Among 
those antifouling paints is, for example, an antifouling paint 
of the hydrolyzable self-polishing type proposed in WO 84/02915 
and JP-A-63-215780 which employs a (meth)acrylic ester polymer 
having triorganosilyl groups in side chains or a similar 
polymer. (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application.")  
 The present inventors made intensive studies on coating 
films of such an organosilicon-containing polymer. As a 
result, it was found that the antifouling paint employing a 
polymer modified by only incorporating triorganosilyl groups in 
side chains of the molecule as described in the above-cited 
reference has problems such as the following: (1) the coating 
film does not show erosion in the rotary test which is the most 
important test for evaluating hydrolyzable antifouling paints 
(a test for measuring coating film thickness reduction as 
erosion rate in which test pieces are fixed to the outer 
circumferential surface of a cylindrical drum and the drum is 
rotated in seawater at a peripheral speed of 16 knots); (2) the 
coating film does not exhibit satisfactory antifouling 
properties in exposure test (immersion test); and (3) the 
coating film develops cracking and shows poor adherence to the 
substrate or primer coat, so that it peels off when immersed in 
seawater. Thus, the antifouling paints of the above-described 
kind do not have properties required for antifouling paints. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a coating composition giving a coating film which 
undergoes neither cracking nor peeling and shows moderate 
hydrolyzability to dissolve into seawater constantly at an 
adequate
