<ABSTRACT>
A method for everting a tubular liner bag (1) into a 
pipe (10) to line the pipe with the tubular liner bag, 

comprising the steps of: (a) attaching an air hose end 
to a suitable position of the outer surface (before 

everting) of the liner bag; (b) everting the tubular 
liner bag by means of water pressure into a vertical 

entrance to the pipe; (c) turning the head of the 
tubular liner bag toward a pipe entrance, when the 

eversion head hits upon the inner wall of the pipe; (d) 
everting the tubular liner bag substantially deep into 

the pipe; (e) stopping the eversion; (f) deforming the 
everted tubular liner bag such that it is roughly shaped 

like a letter J with the head portion of the tubular 
liner bag corresponding to the toe of the J-letter, and 

such that when compressed air of a pressure not 
substantially greater than the pressure required to 

force the tubular liner bag to evert exists in the toe 
section of the J-letter shaped tubular liner bag, the 

air does not get to the long-leg section of the J-letter 
shaped bag from the toe section; and (g) operating an 

air compressor (7) to supply compressed air into the 
head portion of the tubular line
r bag by way of the air 
hose (8) to thereby increase the internal pressure in  

 
the head portion of the tubular liner to values 

substantially greater than that required to force the 
tubular liner bag to evert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for everting a tubular
liner bag into a pipe in order to line the pipe by applying
the tubular liner bag on the inner wall of the pipe. The meaning
of the term "everting" as used herein shall be explained below.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline and passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform dependably, the pipe is
repaired without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) Sho 60-242038.According to this publication, this method of pipe repair comprises
inserting a sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the
pipe to be repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or
water. The tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent
material impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer
surface covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, and then the closed end
of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open end of
the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked (anchored) at
the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner such that the 
wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly covers and
closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed into the
pipe; then, the pressurized fluid is applied to the said portion of
the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular liner to
enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is hooked at
the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of the
flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper in
the pipe, and this manner of insertion is exactly what is meant by
the term "everting" as used above and throughout
this application. When the entire length of the tubular
liner bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe. Then,
the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall of the
pipe by the said pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible liner
is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the liner is
heated, which is effected by heating the

A method for everting a tubular liner bag (1) into a pipe (10) to line
the pipe by applying the tubular liner bag on the inner wall of the pipe,

comprising the steps of: (a) preparing the tubular liner bag (1) such that one
end of an air hose (8) whose other end is connected to an air compressor (7)

is attached to a suitable position of the outer surface of the liner bag prior to
effecting eversion of the liner bag; (b) everting the tubular liner bag by

means of water pressure into a vertical entrance to the pipe; (c) turning the
head of the tubular liner bag toward that side of the pipe which is to be

lined, when the head of the tubular liner bag reaches the inner wall of the
pipe; (d) everting the tubular liner bag into the pipe; (e) stopping eversion

of the tubular liner bag; (f) deforming the everted tubular liner bag such that
it is approximately shaped like a letter J with the head portion of the tubular

liner bag corresponding to the toe of the J-letter, and such that when
compressed air of a pressure not substantially greater than the pressure

required to force the tubular liner bag to evert exists in the toe section of the
J-letter shaped tubular liner bag, the air does not get to the long-leg section

of the J-letter shaped bag from said toe section; and (g) operating said air
compressor (7) to supply compressed air into the head portion of the tubular

liner bag by way of said air hose (8) to thereby increase the internal
pressure in the head portion of the tubular liner to values substantially

greater than that required to force the tubular liner bag to evert; wherein
said step (f) consists of the following substeps: (i) laying an inflatable air

bag (2) adapted to inflate when supplied with compressed air in the pipe at
an optimum location, (ii) supplying said inflatable air bag with compressed 

air to thereby inflate the air bag, and (iii) lowering a press means (9) down
in said vertical entrance to depress an optimum location of the everted

tubular liner bag (1); and wherein in said step (d) the tubular liner bag (1) is
everted until the eversion head thereof is substantially beyond said air bag

(2) laid in the pipe.
