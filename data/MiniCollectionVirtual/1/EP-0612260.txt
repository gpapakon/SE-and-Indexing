<ABSTRACT>
A hyperthermia apparatus having a three-dimensional target positioning capability is disclosed. The apparatus includes a signal modifier (16), having electromagnetic power splitting, phase adjusting, and power gain capabilities, connected to a plurality of power connector assemblies (18) having individual antenna power and power phase adjusting capability. The power connector assemblies (18) connect power at preselected phases to a plurality of antenna groups (27) forming an applicator. Each antenna group (32) includes three antennae (34) preferably of the dipole type stacked end to end on a tube of dielectric material (54). The phase of the power applied to the three antennae (34) of the antenna groups (32) is selected to provide a target heating spot positionable or adjustable in size in a body portion in a direction along the long axis of the body portion and within the cross section perpendicular to the long axis. This adjustable size and positioning of the target along the long axis provides an additional dimension to the capability of moving the target perpendicular to the long axis in either direction from the center as provided in known applicators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hyperthermia apparatus
and more particularly to an apparatus having three-dimensional
(3-D) focusing capability with combined
hyperthermia treatment and noninvasive thermometry
capabilities.Known hyperthermia treatment systems include multiple
applicators and multiple temperature sensors for
controlling the operation of the hyperthermia system. The
multiple applicators utilizing ultrasound or
electromagnetic energy in the direct contact operating
mode are placed directly upon an elastic cooling belt
containing a circulating cooling liquid to carry the heat
of hyperthermia treatment away from the surface of the
healthy tissue. The temperature sensors are implanted in
the normal tissue, in the vicinity of the tumor, as well as
within the tumor, Systems involving the placement of
temperature sensors within the body are referred to as
invasive thermometry systems. Those persons skilled in
the art desiring additional information for this system
are referred to US-A-4,397,314.A known instrument for detecting microwave energy and
for giving an accurate measurement of the power density
thereof is disclosed in US-A-3,919,638.
This instrument is
substantially unaffected by polarization or modulation of
the electromagnetic waves and includes a planar array of
parallel connected diode detectors each having a pair of
antenna leads forming a dipole antenna. The diode array
may include groups of diodes having different antenna lead
lengths to detect different frequencies of microwave
energy for display by a meter. The meter may be
selectively switched between the outputs of the different
groups. Further, the potential use of multiple frequency band
radiometry as a means of noninvasive sensing of one-dimensional
temperature profiles is presented in an
article entitled "Noninvasive Thermometry Using Multiple-Frequency-Band
Radiometry: A Feasibility Study:, Stavros
D. Prionas and G. M. Hahn, Bioelectromagnetic 6:391-404,
1985 Alan R. Liss, Inc. The article discloses that
microwave thermography has been extensively used for the
detection of cancerous nodules. Operating frequencies in
the range of 1.3 to 6.0 GHz (free space wavelengths in the
range of 5 to 23 cm.s) have been employed. At these long
wavelengths subcutaneous temperature measurement is
possible and detection of superficial tumors in the brain
and thyroid is, in principle, feasible.The article further discloses that a computer
tomographic approach using 10 GHz microwaves has been
proposed as an alternative to mammographic
