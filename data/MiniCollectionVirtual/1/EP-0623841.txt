<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a low volume processor 
for processing photosensitive material which comprises 

a plurality of processing modules (10) each having a 
narrow horizontal processing channel. The processing 

modules (10) are interconnected either horizontally, 
vertically or both to provide a compact arrangement 

compatible with the space available.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to automatic
processors and is more particularly concerned with the
vertical and horizontal positioning and coupling of
processing modules forming such processors.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. These steps
lend themselves to mechanization by conveying a
continuous web of film or cut sheets of film or
photographic paper sequentially through a series of
stations or tanks, each one containing a different
processing liquid appropriate to the process step at
that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks which contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.Typically large photofinishing apparatus and
microlabs utilize fixed and integrated horizontal and
vertical arrangements of racks and tanks. The problem
with fixed or integrated photofinishing apparatus and
microlabs is that their rack and tank configuration
are arranged on a horizontal surface i.e. a floor.
This arrangement requires a large amount of floor
space.In addition the foregoing arrangement of
racks and tanks is fixed according to the photographic
process steps (developer, bleach, fix and wash) being 
utilized in the photographic processor. If the site
that one wants to utilize for the photographic
processor did not contain sufficient horizontal floor
space, the photographic processor could not be
installed. In the event, an existing photographic
processor was placed in a horizontal space and one
wanted to modify the processes sequentially performed
in the processor by adding additional racks and tanks,
one is constrained by the amount of horizontal space
available.Furthermore, if a rack and tank has to be
eliminated from the process sequence, the rack and
tank are skipped by the use of a cross over. The
space which the rack and tank occupied is not
eliminated because the rack and the tank have not been
removed. A cross over has been added. Thus, no
additional space is gained. Not only does the
foregoing create unusable space, it adds excess cross
over time to the process step. If the change in
process sequence requires the addition of a rack and
tank, the inflexibility of current fixed integrated
rack and tank designs allow no space or means to add
additional
