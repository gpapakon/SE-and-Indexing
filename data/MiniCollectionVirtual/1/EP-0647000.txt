<ABSTRACT>
High output power, high gain, and low noise are achieved in a two-stage optical 
amplifier, suitable for use as a repeater for a long haul lightwave communication system, in 

accordance with the principles of the invention, by employing a first amplifying stage 
having a signal gain sufficiently small to prevent self-saturation by amplified stimulated 

emission (ASE) that uses counter-propagating pump light to cause maximum inversion of 
the first stage amplifying medium. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, EDFAs 

are used in each of two amplifying stages. The length of the EDFA in the first stage is 
short enough to ensure nearly complete inversion of the EDFA from pump light that 

counter-propagates with the signal. The counter-propagating pump light allows the 
invention to advantageously avoid the significant noise figure penalty from the input loss 

associated with co-propagating pump light. And, noise figure is improved because 
complete inversion is achieved throughout the EDFA, and, at the input where the noise 

figure is most sensitive to inversion. The short length also eliminates self-saturation of the 
EDFA from ASE which degrades the noise figure. However, the length, and hence the 

gain, of the EDFA in the first stage is long enough to provide sufficient gain so that the 
noise figure of the two-stage amplifier, as a whole, is determined primarily by that of the 

first stage. A second EDFA in the second stage of the amplifier may then be configured 
using co-propagating or counter-propagating pump light for additional signal amplification 

to provide the required output power and gain for long haul lightwave systems. Other 
aspects of illustrative embodiments of the invention include the use of passive optical 

elements including filters, isolators, and attenuators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical amplifiers for lightwave communications 
and, more particularly to a two-stage optical amplifier having high output power, high 
gain, and low noise. Optical amplifiers in the form of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are 
expected to replace the current optoelectronic regenerators in many future optical long 
haul terrestrial and undersea lightwave communications systems. Optical amplifiers may be 
used as power amplifiers to boost transmitter power; as preamplifiers to increase receiver 
sensitivity; and, as repeaters to periodically boost the signal to a level sufficient for it to 
traverse the entire lightwave system. Optical amplifiers are designed by considering a number of parameters including 
gain, output power, compression (i.e. gain saturation), and noise performance. Noise 
performance is typically measured by the noise figure which is defined as the signal-to-noise 
ratio at the input of the optical amplifier divided by that at the output. When optical 
amplifiers are used as repeaters, they should operate with very low noise figure and high 
output power in order to maximize the distance between adjacent repeaters in the 
lightwave system. For example, it would be very desirable, in future lightwave 
communications systems, to increase the distance between adjacent repeaters from the 
current 40 km to 100 km, or more. High output power is also required where repeaters 
are used in systems employing multiple multiplexed channels. In addition, repeaters must 
have sufficient gain to compensate for the loss in the optical fiber span between repeaters. One prior art optical amplifier arrangement uses multiple EDFA stages to improve 
the gain characteristics of the optical amplifier. In this arrangement, two separate stages of 
amplification are separated by passive optical components. These passive optical 
components are required elements in most repeater arrangements, and may include 
isolators, filters, pump multiplexers, and the like. Typically in the prior art, passive optical 
elements are positioned at either the input or output of the optical amplifier. In this 
particular prior art arrangement, however, the placement of the passive elements between 
the two stages allows the multistage amplifier to have high gain while avoiding an increase 
in noise that would occur if the passive element were placed at the input of a single stage  
 
amplifier, or a loss of output power that would result if the elements were placed at the 
output of a
