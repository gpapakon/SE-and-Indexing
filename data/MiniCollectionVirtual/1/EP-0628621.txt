<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for cooling 
and cleaning gases containing tar-like or other 

impurities, and to a reactor. In the method, 
process gas is first fed into a hot fluidized 

bed (4), where the tar-like impurities contained 
in it crack into smaller fractions, whereafter 

the process gas is passed onward, the fluidized 
bed material entrained in the process gas is 

separated from the process gas and returned 
through the cooler (8) into the fluidized bed 

and into the process gas stream, whereby the 
process gas cools under the influence of the 

cooled fluidized bed material. The reactor 
comprises a cooler (8) above the fluidized bed 

(4) and an annular conduit (7) outside the 
cooler (8), through which conduit the process 

gas flows into the upper portion of the reactor 
after the fluidized bed (4). It further comprises 

a fluidized grate (11) below the cooler 
(8), to which grate the cooled fluidized bed 

material from the cooler (8) drops, and from 
where the fluidized bed material is returned 

into the fluidized bed (4) and into the process 
gas stream by feeding the process gas to be 

treated into it as fluidizing gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for treating 
process gas formed in pressurized gasification of 
biomass, such as wood, and containing tar-like carbon 
compounds and possibly other impurities, wherein the 
process gas is passed through a fluidized bed consisting 
of a fluidized bed material of solid particles in 
such a way that the process gas is fed into a bubble 
bed zone in the lower portion of the fluidized bed, 
whereafter part of the fluidized bed material is 
carried along with the process gas stream, the fluidized 
bed material is separated from the process gas 
stream and returned into the fluidized bed, whereby 
the process gas acts as fluidizing gas in the fluidized 
bed, and the process gas is cooled by cooling the 
fluidized bed material. The invention also relates to a reactor for 
treating process gas formed in pressurized gasification 
of biomass, such as wood, and containing tar-like 
carbon compounds and possibly other impurities, 
comprising an inlet conduit for feeding process gas to 
the lower portion of the reactor; an outlet conduit 
for removing process gas from the reactor; a fluidized 
bed consisting of a fluidized bed material of solid 
particles in the lower portion of the reactor, whereby 
the process gas entering a bubble bed zone in the 
lower portion of the fluidized bed is fed in such a 
way that it acts as fluidizing gas in the fluidized 
bed; separating means for separating fluidized bed 
material carried along with the process gas stream; at 
least one return conduit for returning fluidized bed 
material into the reactor; and a cooler for cooling 
the fluidized bed material and hence the process gas. Process gases of different types, such as gases  
 
formed in the gasification of fuel, contain various 
impurities, such as tars, sulphur compounds, and 
alkali metal compounds. Similarly, process gas formed 
in pressurized gasification of biomass, especially 
wood, contains plenty of various tar-like carbon 
compounds. In view of the further processing and 
subsequent use of gases, it is usually necessary to 
remove impurities from the gases and, especially in 
the treatment of gases formed in gasification, to cool 
them to a temperature more suitable for their further 
processing. Gases are typically cooled in various 
fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed reactors, 
where the fluidized bed is cooled by a separate cooling 
pipe assembly or the like while the gas is passed 
through the fluidized bed. Finnish Patent 76 834 discloses a solution where
