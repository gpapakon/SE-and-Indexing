<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a DNA sequence encoding the exo-polygalacturonase gene from Aspergillus. Specifically the Aspergillus tubigensis exo-polygalacturonase gene is cloned and expressed. The invention relates to vectors comprising the exo-polygalacturonase coding sequence and to host cells transformed with such vectors. The invention further relates to the production of recombinant exo-polygalacturonase and to the use of this protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Cloninσ and expression of the exo-polygalacturonase gene from AspergillusTechnical fieldThe present invention is in the field of molecular biology. Specifically, a DNA sequence encoding the exo- polygalacturonase gene from Aspergillus is cloned and expressed. The invention relates to vectors comprising the exo-polygalacturonase coding sequence and to host cells transformed with such vectors. The invention further relates to the production of recombinant exo-polygalacturonase. Furthermore, as an example of the application of this enzyme partial pectin degradation is demonstrated.Background of the inventionPectins are major constituents of the cell walls of edible parts of fruits and vegetables. The middle lamella which are situated between the cell walls are mainly built up from protopectin which is the insoluble form of pectin. Pectins are considered as intercellular adhesives and due to their colloid nature they also have an important function in the water-regulation of plants. Water-binding capacity is greatly increased by the amount of hydrophylic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. The amount of pectin can be very high. For example, lemon peels are reported to contain pectin up to 30% of their dry weight, orange peels contain from 15-20% and apple peels about 10% (Norz, K. , 1985. Zucker und Sύsswaren Wirtschaft 3J3 5-6) . Pectins are composed of a rhamno-galacturonan backbone in which 1,4-linked α-D-galacturonan chains are interrupted at intervals by the insertion of 1,2-linked α-L- 

rhamnopyranosyl residues (Pilnik, W. and A. Voragen 1970. In 'The Biochemistry of fruits and their products7, Vol. 1 , Chapter 3, p.53. Acad. Press). Other sugars, such as D- galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, are present as side chains. A large part of the galacturonan residues is esterified with methyl groups at the C2 and C3 position.Pectin-degrading enzymes are important tools in the food industry. Traditionally these enzymes are used as mixtures. Aspergillus niger and other fungi produce a whole spectrum of enzymes which can advantageously be used in the degradation of pectin. Examples of such enzymes are pectin esterase, pectin lyase (also called pectin transeliminase) , endo- and exo-polygalacturonases. In A. niger the pectin degrading proteins are not expressed constitutively.Induction of these enzymes is achieved by growing the strains when carbon sources such as glucose or sucrose are limiting and in the presence of pectin or breakdown products thereof.In order to avoid the problem of induction and also to
