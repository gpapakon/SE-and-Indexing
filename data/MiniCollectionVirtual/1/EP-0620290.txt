<ABSTRACT>
Process for forming a coating (5) on a substrate (3) by reactive cathode sputtering in a closed vessel (1) in the presence of a plasma of an unreactive gas and of a reactive gas containing the element(s) from which the abovementioned coating is to be formed, according to which use is made of a target (2) which has a surface layer (4) directed towards the substrate and containing at least one of the elements to be deposited on the latter by cathode sputtering, according to which the thickness of this surface layer (4) is controlled during the cathode sputtering by adjusting the concentration of the gases in the abovementioned closed vessel (1).

Process for forming a coating (5) on a substrate 
(3) by reactive cathodic sputtering in a closed chamber 

(1) in the presence of a plasma of an unreactive gas, 
such as argon, and of a reactive gas containing the 

element or elements from which the abovementioned coating 
is to be formed, in which use is made of a target (2) 

having a surface layer (4) facing the substrate, the said 
surface layer (4) containing at least one of the elements 

to be deposited on the latter by cathodic sputtering, 
this sputtering being carried out under conditions such 

that this or these element(s) can be deposited on the 
target (2) in order to form the abovementioned surface 

layer (4) and can be ejected from the latter under the 
effect of the ionized gas, to be then deposited on the 

substrate (3), and such that the thickness of this 
surface layer (4) is controlled during the cathodic 

sputtering by adjusting the concentration of the gases in 
the aforementioned closed chamber (1). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the thickness of the surface layer (4) of the target 

(2) is controlled during the cathodic sputtering by 
adjusting the ration of the respective flow rates of the 

unreactive gas and of the reactive gas in the abovementioned 
chamber (1). 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that it makes use of DC and/or AC 

cathodic sputtering. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a reactive gas containing acetylene  

 
and/or trimethylaluminium is used. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the pressure in the chamber is set 

between 133 Pa and 1.33 × 10
-3
 Pa (1 torr and 10
-5
 torr). 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the pressure in the chamber is set between 13.3 Pa 

and 1.33 × 10
-2
 Pa (0.1 and 10
-4
 torr). 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the plasma is generated by a DC 

electric current, with a magnetic-field effect, the 
current density on the target being between 10
-3
 and 
1 A.cm
-2
. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that a DC electric current is applied, the current 

density on the target being from 10
-3
 to 0.03 A.cm
-2
. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, the unreactive gas being argon and 

the reactive gas acetylene, the respective flow rates of 
these two gases are adjusted in order to obtain a volume 

ratio in the aforementioned chamber of between 1 and 10
-
3
. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the aforementioned respective flow rates are 

adjusted in order to obtain a volume ratio in the 
aforementioned chamber of between 10
-1
 and 10
-2
. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the thickness of the surface layer 

is monitored by analysing the composition of the gases in 
the closed chamber (1).
