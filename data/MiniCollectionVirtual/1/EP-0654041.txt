<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with new antiinflammatory agents. In particular, this
invention relates to compounds which are derivatives of 4-amino-2,2-difluoro-3-oxo-1,6-hexanedioic
acid; to the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of such derivatives; to
   using such derivatives in inhibiting interleukin 1β converting enzyme (ICE)
and for treating inflammatory conditions in mammals, especially man; and to
pharmaceutical compositions useful therefor.Current therapies for arthritis are severely limited by the side effects of available
drugs and their ineffectiveness beyond treatment for disease symptoms. The most
widely used drugs are agents (the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, NSAIDS) which
inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. While these
compounds are effective in controlling the symptoms of arthritis, they are not disease
remittive. Furthermore, cyclooxygenase inhibition is invariably associated with the major
side-effect of NSAID therapy, gastrointestinal irritation. Steroids are used in the more
severe cases of arthritis and are very effective. However, long term therapy using
steroids is seldomly tolerable. Second line antiinflammatory agents such as gold,
penicillamine, chloroquine and methotrexate are also beset with side effect issues which
severely limit their general utility.Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been strongly implicated as a key mediator of tissue
damage in osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis. Lowering levels of IL-1 in a diseased joint
would be expected to halt continued degeneration and perhaps allow joint repair to
take place. One approach to reducing levels of IL-1 is to block the generation of
mature IL-1β from its biologically inactive precursor, pro-IL-1β, by inhibition of the
interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE). This invention relates to a novel series of
compounds which inhibit ICE. The compounds should act as disease remittive
antiinflammatory agents and are not expected to elicit the side effects associated with
NSAID therapy (due to cyclooxygenase inhibition), steroids or other treatments currently
in use.Peptidyl derivatives containing difluorostatone are described in: S. Thaisrivongs
et al., J. Med. Chem., 1986, 29, 2080-2087 and K. Fearon et al., J. Med. Chem., 1987,
30, 1617-1622. This invention is concerned with new compounds which are useful for the
treatment of diseases associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1). The
compounds block the formation of biologically active mature IL-1β from its precursor
pro-IL-1β by
