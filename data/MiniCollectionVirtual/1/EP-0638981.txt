<ABSTRACT>
A method and circuit (10) for establishing the operating status of a 
direct drive, multiple speed motor (13), the method including providing 

feedback to an air distribution system for indicating first whether the system 
motor is operating and secondly which speed winding has been selected, 

wherein the circuit senses the voltage differences between the speed 
windings (20, 22) of the motor and also between the high speed motor 

winding (22) and the power supply (25), the voltage differences sensed by 
the circuit determining whether a first light emitting diode (32) is illuminated, 

the illumination of the first light emitting diode indicating to the system 
controller whether the motor is operating and whether a second light emitting 

diode (38) is illuminated, indicating to the controlled which speed winding 
has been selected, thus providing the necessary feedback to the controller 

of the air distribution system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of integrated function control 
and more particularly to the control of motors in air distribution systems, such 
as an HVAC or dual-firing rate furnace systems. Most modern furnace designs involve direct drive fans for air distribution. 
These fans are typically designed for use at multiple speeds, allowing the user 
to operate the fans at varying speeds. In fact, many designs for integrated 
function controls directly incorporate the speed select function. One example 
of this type of system is the air distribution motor in an HVAC system. Another 
example is the two-speed inducer motor in a dual-firing rate furnace system. There are times when proof of motor operation within these systems is 
necessary for a particular function to be performed. One example is the 
twinning module concept, where two furnaces are connected to one duct 
system. Because the twinning module concept operates with one duct system, 
it is necessary to activate the fans of both furnaces at the appropriate speed 
so that backflow will not occur in one of the furnaces. This does not mean that 
both systems must be supplying conditioned air; if only one system is needed 
in full operation, it is only necessary to operate the fan of the other system. Current air distribution systems are capable of commanding both fans 
to operate, but the systems provide no feedback to the system controller 
verifying that both fans are indeed operating at the appropriate speed. The  
 
feedback to the system is necessary to prevent 
inefficiency in the system and also damage to the 
furnace caused by backflow. Backflow produces an 
inefficient air distribution system by redirecting 
the conditioned air away from the residence or 
building into the second furnace system. 
Additionally, the backflow into the second furnace 
system may cause the second fan to rotate backwards, 
causing damage to the furnace when the motor does 
start. Current methods are available to provide feedback 
to the system controller. The first of these is 
through the use of direct sensing, which essentially 
involves the use of either photo or magnetic sensing 
devices to detect the movement of the blades of the 
fan. This method requires significant additional 
hardware and is therefore a very expensive addition 
to an air distribution system. Furthermore, the 
system must be designed particularly for this method; 
it may not be updated to include such a sensing 
device. This causes the direct sensing method to be 
both an
