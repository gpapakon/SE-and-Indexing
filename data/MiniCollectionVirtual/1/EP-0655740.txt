<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a recording medium 
management method, and digital data for computer 

processing are stored on a magnetooptic disk that is 
usually used to record compressed digital audio data. 

When computer data are recorded to clusters (16-27) 
of a data recording area, the range of the clusters 

(16-27) is secured as a usable range in a management 
table (parts table) of U-TOC. On the parts table (02h), 

a segment using is recorded using the cluster (16) as 
a start address and the cluster (27) as an end address. 

To manage the recording state of the computer data, 
FAT (File Allocation Table) is separately prepared 

to manage the recording state of the clusters (16-27).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording medium management
method suitable when used in the case of recording digital
data to be processed by computer onto a magneto-optical disc
on which digital audio data is primarily recorded in
compressed manner, or reproducing it from such a magneto-optical
disc, and to a system and to a recording medium
using said method.For managing the recording of digital data on a recording
medium, it is known to provide a TOC (table of contents)
area, forming a type of first table - see for example EP-A2-0
448 378, forming the preamble part of claim 1.Recently, mini-discs (MD) (Tradename) using magneto-optical
disc as recording medium, and adapted for compressing
digital audio data to record compressed data thereonto and
expanding such compressed data to reproduce therefrom data
corresponding to original data have been being popularized.
Fig. 29 shows a recording format in this mini-disc. As shown
in this figure, one circumference of the mini-disc is
divided into a plurality of sectors. One cluster is
constituted by 36 sectors, and compressed digital audio data
is recorded with this cluster being as unit.In the case of mini-disc for recording, the leading three 
sectors of one cluster (= 36 sectors) is caused to serve as a
link sector, and the next one sector is caused to serve as sub
data sector. To this sub data sector, sub data except for audio
data is allocated. The link sector is caused to serve as an area
for connecting clusters before and after, and audio data is
recorded only in 32 sectors except for the link sector and the
sub data sector.On the other hand, in mini-disks dedicated to reproduction,
data are continuously recorded (are not discretely recorded), and
three sectors of the link area therefore become unnecessary.
Accordingly, in this case, these three sectors are caused to also
serve as sub data sector.One sector consists of 2352 bytes (2332 bytes for data), and
11 sound groups are allocated to two successive sectors. One
sound group consists of 424 bytes, and audio data of the left
channel and the right channel are allocated thereto by 512
samples (11.61 ms) in total. Recording of digital audio data is
carried out with the sound group being as unit.It is conceivable to use such mini-disc as, e.g., storage
unit of computer. In this case, in order to carry out management
of data of computer as file, since cluster (36 sectors) is too
large as unit, it is preferable to have ability of recording data
in a unit (e.g., sector unit) smaller than cluster. However, as
