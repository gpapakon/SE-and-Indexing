<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for reducing the volume of aqueous process water (42) containing non-evaporable (non-volatile) constituents, in particular solutions from photographic processes, has an evaporation chamber (16) in which the process water (42) can be reduced in volume and concentrated by evaporation of water. To achieve a simply structured and energy-saving reduction in volume, it is proposed that air be fed to the evaporation chamber (16) in such a way that an increase in the surface area of the process water (42) results and that the evaporation chamber (16) be provided with at least one outlet orifice (34) whose outlet cross-section is calculated in such a way that the amount of air (38) fed to the evaporation chamber (16) results in an increased pressure pv compared with the external environment of the evaporation chamber (16).
