<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing a novel NOx decomposing catalyst and a denitration method using the same, 
and the characteristics of the invention reside in an NOx decomposing catalyst in which vanadium oxide is supported 

on anatase type titanium oxide having a specific surface area of 100-250 

m²/g and not less than 0.05 cc/g each of 
micropores of diameters of 15-25Å and 75-85Å, and an exhaust gas denitration method in which an NOx-containing 

exhaust gas is treated by bringing the same gas into contact with the above-mentioned 
catalyst at a temperature in 

the range of 100-350 °C in the presence of a reducing gas. An NOx-containing 
exhaust gas with which a catalyst-poisoning 

substance, such as water and SOx coexists can be treated efficiently at a comparatively low temperature 
of not higher than 170 °C, at which a practical treatment for the exhaust gas cannot be conducted in a conventional 

method of this kind, without causing N₂O to be byproduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst for the decomposition of nitrogen
oxides contained in a waste gas, etc., in particular, a catalyst of titanium
oxide-vanadium type for the decomposition of nitrogen oxides, having a high
denitrification activity at a relatively low temperature, and a method for the
denitrification using the catalyst.Waste gases formed by combustion of various fosil fuels contain nitrogen
oxides (hereinafter referred to as "NOx"), resulting in one cause of air
pollution. NOx includes NO, NO2, N2O3, N2O4, N2O, etc. and the most part of
NOx contained in waste gases formed by combustion of various fosil fuels
such as petroleums, coals, etc. is NO. A number of proposals have been made
as a method of treating NOx in waste gases. In the so-called catalytic reduction
denitrification method comprising contacting a waste gas with a catalyst
in the presence of ammonia (NH3) as a reducing agent to reduce and decompose
NOx in the waste gas to N2 and to render it harmless, the reduction and decomposition
of NOx selectively proceed even in the co-existence of oxygen. This
is an effective method as a waste gas denitrification method.As a catalyst for progressing such reduction and decomposition of NOx,
a number of catalysts have been proposed, one of which is a titanium oxide-vanadium
type catalyst. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
No. 51966/1975(Japanese Patent Publication No. 2912/1979) discloses a method
comprising contacting nitrogen oxides with a catalyst comprising vanadium
supported on titanium oxide in the presence of ammonia at a temperature of
150 to 650 °C and thereby decomposing the nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and
water. The catalyst used in this method has excellent properties, for example,
a very high activity for the reduction reaction of NOx at a high temperature, 
e.g. at least 170 °C. In this case, the temperature at which NOx is contacted
with the catalyst is in the range of 150 to 650 °C, but the specific surface
area of the catalyst comprising vanadium supported on titanium oxide is ordinarily
at most about 50 m2/g and the denitrification activity is markedly
lowered at a reaction temperature of at most 170 °C to largely lower the decomposition
capacity of NOx.As described above, the catalyst comprising vanadium supported on titanium
oxide have hitherto been proposed, but the catalyst of this type has the problem
that a practically high denitrification capacity is hardly obtained unless
a waste gas is contacted with the catalyst at a temperature of 200 to
500
