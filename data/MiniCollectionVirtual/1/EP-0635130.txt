<ABSTRACT>
A portable thermal analysis device, in particular "on site" analyses for determining the TOC-value of samples of liquid and solid substances, has a housing (1) in which is arranged a temperature-regulated oven (6), into which at least one test tube (7) may be inserted. A regulated heat supply device is provided for uniformly heating the inserted test tube (7).

<CLAIMS>
Transportable analytical device for carrying out chemical analyses,
especially for on-site TOC determinations,


with a housing (1) containing a temperature-controlled oven
(6) in which at least one reactor vessel (7) can be installed,
a controlled heat supply device generated by flame (17) for
evenly heating the installed reactor vessels,
a combustion chamber in which incineration proceeds,
a horizontal or vertical incineration shaft (5), with the shaft
being adjustable vertically or horizontally in the oven

depending on the model,

characterised by the following:

the heat supply device is a bumer system which includes an
ignition component and a main flame (17, 18) consisting of one

or more flame groups,
the main flame is clocked,
a flame-containing layer (21) is located between the tip of the
flame and the reactor vessel (7),
a pressure-resistant fuel container is planned in the housing.
Transportable analytical device as described in Claim 1,
characterised by the fact that temperature regulation occurs by continuous

or discontinuous control of the energy feed of the heat supply device.
Transportable analytical device as described in one of the
foregoing Claims, characterised by the fact that a miniature chimney (8)

for the expulsion of exhaust vapours can be attached onto the micro-oven
(6).
Transportable analytical device as described in Claim 3,
characterised by the fact that a fan is fitted for extracting the exhaust

vapours.
Transportable analytical device as described in Claim 1,
characterised by the fact that gaseous or liquid fuels are employed as

energy sources.
