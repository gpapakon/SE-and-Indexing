<ABSTRACT>
The Spacecraft Antennas 
&
 Beam Steering Methods for Satellite Communication System comprises an advanced active element phased antenna array (10). The present invention utilizes electronic beam steering to provide extremely high gain signals. In one of the preferred embodiments of the invention, a satellite (S) includes an Earth-facing array (10) of hexagonal antenna facets (12) that are mated together along their six-sided boundaries to form a slightly flattened, hemispherical shell. The antenna array (10) is connected to two rectilinear, unfurled, solar panels (14) which trail the body of the spacecraft (S) and provide electrical power. The antenna array (10) is designed to transmit and receive signals from terrestrial units that are located within the footprints (20) produced by the electronically steered beams (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent application is related to the following 
co-pending patent applications. WO 93/09613 - Satellite Communication System. Method of Conducting a Telecomnunications Business 
Implemented on a Computer by Edward Fenton Tuck, assigned 
United States Serial Number 07/895,295; WO 93/09577 - Terrestrial Antennas for Satellite 
Communication System. WO 93/09624 - Switching Methods for Satellite Communication 
System. WO 93/09614 - Beam Compensation Methods for Satellite 
Communication System. WO 93/09029 - Spacecraft Designs for Satellite 
Communication System.  
 The present invention relates to the field of satellite communications. More particularly, 
this invention provides an advanced, active element, phased array satellite antenna system which 
provides extremely high gain, but which also uses the available spectrum with great efficiency. The 
power supplied by the invention enables telephone users on the ground to communicate directly with 
a constellation of spacecraft in low Earth orbit using a compact, hand-held terminal which does not 
pose radiation hazards. Existing public phone systems rely primarily on land lines and microwave repeaters to handle 
call traffic. Recent expansions of cellular networks have enhanced phone service by providing access 
to the land based system to customers using mobile phones in their vehicles or hand-held portable 
units. The increased capacity offered to the subscriber is relatively small compared to the number 
of subscribers using conventional fixed phones, since cellular service is limited to only those 
geographical regions that are densely populated. Cellular communication is often afflicted by poor 
performance when customers travel from one cell to another, or when they traverse the radio 
shadows projected by terrain or buildings. One previous radio communication system for a 
metropolitan area is disclosed in the article "IEEE 
Transactions on Communications, Vol 39, No.1, January 1991, 
pages 141 to 151, Acampora et al." The system comprises a 
centrally located base station which covers the surrounding 
service region with a plurality of scanning pencil beams 
operating with a Time Division Multiple Access assignment. 8298 BBC research Department Report (1989), No. 12, 
Tadworth Surrey, GB, discloses a beam forming device for a 
flat plate antenna with a time delay active lens serving 
to control beam steering.  
 One previous attempt to bypass the limits of conventional communications networks utilizes 
a transportable telephone that

directed towards the Earth's surface and capable of 

communicating directly with a plurality of portable (P), 
mobile (M) and fixed (F) terminals, gateways (G) and 

satellites (S) comprising a plurality of antenna surfaces 
(12) coupled and arranged in a generally contiguous

surface of the Earth (E), wherein each antenna surface (12) 

has a plurality of radiating elements (32) and incorporates 
a time delay active lens (30) comprising a plurality of 

time delay networks (28), connected to respective radiating 
elements (32), and a time delay control to change the 

radius of the radiated beam, the arrangement being capable 
of producing a beam of circular or elliptical shape.

the antenna surfaces (12) are each capable of emitting and 

receiving beams (19) over a cone measuring at least 25 
degrees. 
An apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein 
a time delay steered array (37) is connected to the lens 

(30). 
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the array

pattern which approximates the contour of a partially 
oblate hemisphere, each surface being capable of 

simultaneously generating at least 256 beams (19) which can 
be electronically steered to approximately 4,096 positions 

on the surface of the Earth (E), each beam illuminating a 
footprint (20) on the earth measuring approximately 20 

kilometres by 20 kilometres at a gain of at least 40 dB, 
and each surface (12) having a plurality of pairs of 

antennas for separately transmitting and receiving each of 
said beams (19).
