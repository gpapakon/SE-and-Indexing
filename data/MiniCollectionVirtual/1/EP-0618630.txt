<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical cell incorporating a cathode material comprising a mixed 
oxide of vanadium, silver and copper. The cathode materials of this invention are 

formed by the chemical addition, reaction, or otherwise intimate contact of various 
mixed oxides and/or metal elements during thermal treatment in mixed states. A 

preferred material comprises a composite metal oxide matrix formed as the thermal 

decomposition and reaction product of a matrix of vanadium oxide and at least 
decomposable compounds of copper and silver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of electrochemical cells
and more particularly to a new and improved electrochemical cell
and cathode therefor comprising a Group IA anode and a composite
metal-metal-metal oxide cathode.Light metals have exceptionally high energy density when
employed as the anode material in electrochemical cells owing to
their low atomic weight and high standard potential. This high
chemical activity of light metal anode material requires the use
of a nonaqueous electrolyte and a cathode which meets the
rigorous requirements for such a cell. Most cathode materials
are too readily soluble in a nonaqueous electrolyte and, thereby,
reduce the useful capacity of such an electrode after storage.
The cathode material of the present invention uses a mixed-metal
oxide containing copper, silver, and vanadium as an electrode
material for application as a cathode in a lithium battery. This
provides a new and distinct cathode material having the general
formula CuxAgyV2Oz,also referred to herein as CSVO.It is known to use metal oxide as cathode materials in
nonaqueous electrochemical cells. For example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,310,609 to Liang, et al., which is assigned to the assignee
of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference,
discloses the use of a composite cathode material including V2Ox
wherein x = 5 combined with one or more of Ag2Ox wherein x = 1 to 
1; CuOx wherein x = 0 to 1; and MnOx wherein x = 1 to 3. The
composite material is described as a metal oxide-metal oxide, a
metal-metal oxide, or a metal-metal oxide-metal oxide. A
preferred embodiment of this cathode material has the formula
AgV2O5.5, also referred to herein as SVO.While this prior art battery material works well, the
cathode material of the present invention provides an increased
gravimetric energy density and an increased pulse voltage
delivery capacity. This makes the cathode material of the
present invention particularly useful for implantable medical
applications. The CSVO material of the present invention is also
an improvement over SVO cathode material in savings on the
expense of the silver starting material.FR-A-2 616 013 discloses a vanadium or tungsten oxide in which one or more of lithium,
sodium, potassium. calcium, magnesium, silver, copper and nickel are intercalated.This invention relates to electrochemical cells comprising
an anode of a Group IA metal and a cathode of a composite
material prepared by the chemical addition, reaction, or
otherwise intimate contact of several metal oxides, metal
