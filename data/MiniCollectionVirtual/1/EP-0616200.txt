<ABSTRACT>
A spectrum analysis camera (300) which can, by itself, 
deliver both an ordinary color picture and a picture for 

spectrum analysis and a spectrum analysis system. In the CCD 
(charge-coupled device) section of the camera (300); one 

photosensitive unit is constituted by n (at least two) 
photosensors (S₁-S₉). The n photosensors (S₁-S₉) 

are set so 
as to have detection wavelength ranges which do not overlap 

each other. The spectrum analysis is performed using the 
output signals of the individual photosensors (S₁-S₉) in 

Fig. 3(b). On the other hand, the color picture is formed 
using R (red); G (green) and B (blue) signals which are 

created by synthesizing the output signals of the respective 
photosensors (S₁-S₉).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustion evaluation
apparatus including a camera which can deliver both an
ordinary color picture and spectrum analyzing data.In a case where a camera employing a CCD (charge-coupled
device) or the like is applied to spectrum analysis,
only light of a desired wavelength is measured by externally
mounting a filter on the camera. Besides, in the case of
analyzing a spectrum over a plurality of wavelengths, or in
case of requiring an ordinary color picture, a plurality of
filters and cameras are used.Mentioned as an example in which the camera is actually
used for the spectrum analysis in this manner is a video
system for analyzing the spectrum of flames in a gas turbine
combustor as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. 207912/1991. The prior art, however, is problematic as stated below.
In the case of changing-over the plurality of filters in
use, a mechanism for driving the filters is necessitated
which incurs the problem of a complicated structure.It is also considered to install separate cameras for
the respective filters. In this case, however, the operations
of determining positions and angles for photographing,
focussing the cameras, etc. must be performed in correspondence
with the number of cameras for use. This poses the
problem that a rapid measurement is impossible. Especially
in the spectrum analysis, all the cameras need to be focused
on an identical location, resulting in very difficult
handling.Another problem is that the system becomes costly.US-A-4 596 930 shows an arrangement with which a distinction
can be made between targets, by means of signals
from at least two wavelength ranges with the aid of individual
detectors disposed in one focal plane, with the individual
detectors being attached to or inserted into the
charge-coupled semiconductor device.US-A-4 913 647 shows a control of flame conditions in
order to maintain a predetermined fuel/air mixture by detecting
a specific radiation within the flame and comparing
such radiation with a control signal. This difference in
signals is then used to adjust the fuel concentration in the
fuel/air mixture that to the flame.
