<ABSTRACT>
The vehicle door (1) of a passenger car is provided with a reinforcing profile (4) onto which a catch hook (5) is screwed at the lateral edge region of the vehicle door (1). In the closed position of the vehicle door (1) the hook portion (5') of said catch hook is assigned to a trough-shaped recess (10) formed in a body pillar (7), the free end of the hook portion (5') lying approximately in the plane of the facing outer side (7') of the body pillar (7). In the event of an action of force directed (arrow direction A) against the vehicle door (1) the free end of the hook portion (5') slides with a high frictional effect over the outer side (7') of the body pillar (7) which makes it possible, finally, for a bead-like elevation (e) to be produced. As a result, the depth (f) of penetration of the vehicle door (1) into the interior (h) of the vehicle is substantially reduced.

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle with at least one door having a free end region on which at 
least one catch hook is disposed, the book being associated with an upright 

member of the vehicle body when the vehicle door is closed,
 
characterised in that when the door (1) is in the closed position (a) the free 

end (5') of the hook (5) lies near the facing outer side (7') of the upright (7), 
and in the event of a force directed transversely against the door (1) (in the 

direction of arrow A) the free end co-operates with the upright (7), with 
frictional engagement and deformation of the sheet-metal outer side (7'). 
A vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that the free end (5') is set 
back a relatively long distance (dimension b) from the edge (7'') of the 

upright (7) facing the door hinge. 
A vehicle according to claim 2, characterised in that the free end (5') of the 
hook (5) projects into the recess (10) only up to about six times the 

thickness of the sheet metal forming the upright (7). 
A vehicle according to claim 3, characterised in that the recess (10) formed 
on the upright (7) is trough-shaped, and when the door (1) is in the closed 

position (a) a relatively large space (c) is provided between the free end (5') 
of the hook (5) and the outer periphery and base (10') of the recess (10). 
A vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that the hook (5) is of steel 
or light metal. 
A vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that the hook (5) is secured 
to a section member (4) reinforcing the vehicle door (1). 
A vehicle according to claim 2, characterised in that when the door (1) is in  
 

the closed position (a), the free end (5') of the hook (5) is set back by at 
least about ten times the thickness of the metal forming the upright (7) from 

the edge (7'') thereof facing the door hinge (dimension b). 
A vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that when the door (1) is in 
the closed position (a), the centre line (d) of the free end (5') of the hook (5) 

extends at an angle of about 10° to 30° to a transverse plane of the vehicle 
in the case of a side door and extends to a longitudinal plane through the 

vehicle in the case of a rear door. 
A vehicle according to claim 4, characterised in that in the case of a side 
door (1), the back of the free end (5') of the hook (5) extends backward at 

an angle relative to a transverse plane of the vehicle and approximately 
parallel to the back wall (10'') of the trough-shaped recess (10).
