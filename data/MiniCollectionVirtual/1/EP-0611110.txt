<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a core material of a
string for instruments and a string for instruments using
the same. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a core material of a string for instruments, which is
composed of a vinylidene fluoride resin and which can
produce an excellent effect when used for a lower-pitched
string of a violin or other instruments, and also relates
to a string for instruments using such a core material.A string for instruments such as a violin is composed
of a core material and a metal wire tightly wound around
the core material. Strings for instruments known at
present are classified into several kinds according to the
core material, and a gut string and a nylon string are
mainly used as a violin string.A gut string which produces an excellent timbre, is
disadvantageous in that it requires a long time for tuning,
and in that since it is very sensitive to humidity, it is
apt to become out of tune and is also easily broken. In
addition, since the guts of animals are used as a material
of a gut string, there is a problem from the point of view
of the protection of natural sources and the prevention of
cruelty to animals. Furthermore, not only is a gut string 
expensive but also there is a fear of a shortage of
materials of a gut string.On the other hand, a nylon string has the following
defects. Since a nylon string has a water absorption
property, a change of the material with the passage of time
is rather large, so that the nylon string is apt to become
out of tune with the elapse of time, and tuning is
difficult. In addition, when a nylon string absorbs water,
it is difficult to produce a clear sound. Furthermore,
since the vibrational energy of a nylon string is small,
the sound produced has a small volume and lacks a deep
timbre, in other words, the sound is apt to be monotonous.The present inventors proposed a string for
instruments which is composed of a monofilament of a
vinylidene fluoride resin (Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 2-36958 (1990)). It had been
confirmed as a result of careful analysis of complicated
timbres of strings for instruments that the above-described
monofilament which simultaneously satisfies various
properties described in the Japanese KOKAI, are excellent
as a higher-pitched string of a guitar.However, the string for instruments proposed in the
above-described Japanese KOKAI is not originally intended
for a violin and the like. It is difficult to produce a
violin string by winding a metal wire around the
