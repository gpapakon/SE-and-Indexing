<ABSTRACT>
The data words are written to the memories (SM), after having been supplemented for a specific parity, in such a way that at periodic intervals in the sequence of stored data words one of the data words is supplemented in each case to give in each case the other parity compared with the rest of the data words. During reading, the parity bits of the differently treated data words are inverted.

<CLAIMS>
Method for detecting addressing errors in memories
(SM) for digital binary coded data words, characterized

in that the data words are written into the memory
(SM) complemented to a particular parity of binary values

by at least one parity bit, in such a manner that in the
succession of stored data words, at preferably small

periodic intervals which comprise a primary number of
data words, in each case one of the data words is complemented

to the in each case other parity than the remaining
data words, and that during the reading of the said

data words treated differently, the at least one parity
bit of these data words is inverted (
p
) before a parity
check is made.
Method according to Claim 1 for application to a
memory (SM) which is to be written into cyclically and to

be read out randomly, characterized in that the parity
bit of the data words, before they are cyclically written

into the memory (SM), is inverted with the appropriate
binary value of a control bit supplied by a modulo-n-counter

(C3) which is synchronized with the counter (C)
supplying the cyclic write addresses, and in that the

addresses for the random read-out are complemented by an
indicator bit (BI) which, with the appropriate binary

value, identifies data words written in with an inverted
parity bit and, when such data words are read out,

initiates a reinversion of the parity bits before a
parity-bit check is made.
Method according to Claim 1 for application to a
memory (CM) which is to be written into randomly and to

be read out cyclically, characterized in that the data 
words are written in with an unchanged or with an

inverted parity bit in dependence on their order in a
read-out cycle which results from their write addresses,

and in that during their cyclic read-out, their parity
bit is inverted with the appropriate binary value of a

control bit supplied by a modulo-n-counter (C3) which is
synchronized with the counter (C) supplying the cyclic

select read addresses, before a parity check (PK) is
made.
