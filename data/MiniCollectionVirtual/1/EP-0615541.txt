<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous cleaning compositions for a variety of 
applications. It is anticipated that the invention will be particularly useful in 
automobile refinish shops, i.e. for the cleaning of the surface of an automobile or 
other vehicle prior to repair and/or repainting. Automobile refinish shops have for many years utilized special cleaning 
fluids formulated to remove residual wax, tar, sanding dust, and overall grime 
from automobile surfaces upon which work is being performed. Although such 
cleaning fluids have proven to be effective for most types of residue, they have the 
distinct disadvantage of being composed predominantly of organic solvents. In an 
era of increasingly stringent solvent emission regulations, solvent-based cleaners 
present a potential problem. It is estimated that approximately forty percent of 
the effluent in refinish shops is due not to the paint itself, but rather to the 
cleaning fluid. Conventional solvent-based cleaning fluids have the additional 
disadvantage of being unable to readily remove water-soluble dirt, e.g. tree sap 
and bird droppings, from automotive surfaces. Cleaning compositions for use in refinishing have been disclosed in 
various patents. For example, US Patent No. 4,446,044 discloses a cleaner that 
has a low VOC (a low content of volatile organic compounds), which cleaner 
comprises non-ionic ethoxylated surfactants for use in refinish applications. 
However, this cleaner is a water-in-oil emulsion. US Patent No. 5,011,620 
discloses a cleaning composition comprising a dibasic ester solvent and a 
hydrocarbon solvent. There remains a need for a cleaning fluid which not only will facilitate 
compliance with both current and proposed air pollution standards, but will also 
remove both organic solvent soluble and water soluble dirt from automotive or 
other surfaces. EP-A-0378709 describes a composition comprising paraffins or 
naphthenic hydrocarbons, a surfactant, an emulsifier, such as triethanolamine 
oleic acid ester, a solvent, an antioxidant, and a hydrotrope. This document does not disclose a composition containing a hydrocarbon solvent, at least 50% by weight of which being cycloparaffinic 
compounds, an alkyl ester or a composition in the form of an oil-in-water  
 
emulsion wherein the average droplet size of the dispersed organic phase is from 
150 to 250 nanometers. According to the present invention there is provided a cleaning 
composition comprising 80 to 97 percent by weight of an aqueous continuous 
phase and 3 to

<CLAIMS>
A cleaning composition comprising 80 to 97 percent by weight of 
an aqueous continuous phase and 3 to 20 percent by weight of a dispersed organic 

phase comprising, by weight of the dispersed phase, the following: 

(a) 75 to 95 percent of a hydrocarbon solvent which comprises at least 
50% cycloparaffinic compounds and having less than 0.5% by weight aromatics: 
(b) 2 to 20 percent of a monobasic or multibasic alkyl ester having 3 to 
10 carbon atoms in which the alkyl group has 1 to 8 carbon atoms or mixtures 

thereof; and 
(c) 3 to 20 percent of at least one surfactant 
wherein the composition is an emulsion in which the average droplet size 

of the dispersed organic phase is 150 to 250 nanometers. 
The composition of claim I wherein the surfactant is an 
ethoxylated and/or propylated alcohol. 
The composition of claim 1 wherein said alkyl ester is a diisobutyl 
or dimethyl ester of adipic acid, glutaric acid, or succinic acid, or mixtures 

thereof. 
The composition of claim 1 wherein the HLB of the surfactant is 
10.5 to 13.5. 
The composition of claim 1 wherein the structural formula of the 
surfactant is C₁₁₋₁₅H₂₃₋₃₁O[CH₂CH₂O]
n
H, wherein n has an average value of 3 to 7. 
A method of cleaning prior to refinishing a substrate of a truck or 
automobile, comprising the steps of: 


(a) applying over the surface of the substrate to be cleaned, a cleaning 
composition comprising 80 to 97 percent by weight of an aqueous continuous 

phase and 3 to 20 percent by weight of a dispersed organic phase comprising, by 
weight of the dispersed phase, the following:  

 

(i) 75 to 95 percent of a hydrocarbon solvent which comprises 
at least 50% cycloparaffinic compounds and having less than 0.5% 

by weight aromatics; 
(ii) 2 to 20 percent of a monobasic or multibasic alkyl ester 
having 3 to 10 carbon atoms or mixtures thereof; and 
(iii) 3 to 20 percent of at least one surfactant
 
wherein the composition is an emulsion in which the average droplet size of the 

dispersed organic phase is 150 to 250 nanometers; 
(b) removing the composition, now combined with the contaminants, 
from the surface, and 
(c) applying refinish paint to the surface. 
The method of claim 6 further comprising drying the surface with a 
dry cloth after step (b).
