<ABSTRACT>
A comparator device is designed for comparing 
the signal levels of first and second input signals to 

provide respective of resultant comparator outputs 
independently, which comparator device is featured in 

avoidance of occurrence of simultaneous low levels of the 
comparator signals at all possible conditions of the 

comparator outputs. The comparator device includes first 
and second comparators(12, 22) which independently output 

resultant comparator outputs either of H level and L 
level as results of comparison of the signal levels of 

the first and second input signals with taking one of the 
input signals as reference, and have offset 

characteristics and hysteresis characteristics so that the 
comparator outputs, either H level or L level can be 

fixedly determined when the first and second input signal 
levels are equal to each other. The first input signal 

is applied to one of the input terminals of the first 
comparator and the other input terminal of the second 

comparator with different polarity, and the second input 
signal is applied to the other input terminal of the 

first comparator and the one of the input terminals of the 
second comparator with different polarity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a comparator 
device applicable for switching control for a plurality 
of paths in a multi-path transmission system receiving an 
identical modulation signal through a plurality of 
receiving sections,such as a diversity reception system. In general, a comparator device to be applied 
for such type of a diversity reception system includes 
first and second comparator means having the identical 
hysteresis characteristics. With these comparator means, 
voltages corresponding to the receiving condition at two 
transmission pathsare compared to control transmission 
means for transmitting a transmitting signal based on 
respective comparator outputs. Control is typically 
performed to switch one of the comparator means from 
conducting state to non-conducting state and the other 
comparator means from non-conducting state to conducting 
state. Upon input, both of the transmission means for 
the transmitting signal temporarily become conductive for 
avoiding drop out of the transmitting signal or click 
noise due to delay in response at the transmission means. Here, a diversity receiver having typical two 
receiving sections, for which the conventional comparator 
device is applied, is schematically illustrated in 
Fig. 1.  
 In the diversity receiver illustrated in Fig. 
1, the reference numerals 1 and 2 denote first and second 
antennas corresponding to respective receiving common 
modulation signal, 10 and 20 denote first and second 
receiver means respectively corresponding to the receiving 
channels. Through respective receiving channels, 
first and second demodulation signal outputs of the 
received signals, and first and second receiving condition 
signals V1 and V2 corresponding to the receiving 
conditions of respective receiving channels are 
obtained. The first and second receiving condition 
signals V1 and V2 have the characteristics to be 
greater for better receiving condition. The reference numerals 11 and 21 denote first 
and second variable transmission means for transmitting 
the first and second demodulated signals from the first 
and second receiving means 10 and 20 to a common output 
terminal 14. The reference numerals 12 and 22 denote first 
and second comparator means which have the identical 
hysteresis characteristics. Respective pairs of inputs of 
the first and second comparator means 12 and 22 have 
mutually different polarities and the inputs having the 
different polarities are connected to each other. The 
first and second receiving condition
