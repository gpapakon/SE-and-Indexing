<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a Ni-based alloy which is 
excellent in anti-corrosion properties, in particular anti-pitting 
corrosion property and anti-crevice corrosion 
property in an environment containing chlorine ions, as well 
as in workability, in particular workability in hot working. Ni-based alloys having excellent anti-corrosion 
properties have hitherto been used in the manufacture of 
exhaust gas desulfurizers for chemical plants, 
electroplating devices, boilers or the like; structural 
members for semiconductor devices; food processing devices; 
medical equipment; and various cutter blades and manual 
tools which are exposed to sea water; or the like. Ni-based alloys conventionally known as such anti-corrosive 
alloys include a Ni-based alloy (hereinafter 
referred to as "alloy 55C") disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application, Laid-Open (First-Publication) No. 62-40337, and 
consisting of 30.1 weight % of Cr, 20.3 weight % of Mo, 
balance Ni and unavoidable impurities; a Ni-based alloy 
(hereinafter referred to as "alloy 625") disclosed in United 
States Patent No. 3,160,500 and consisting of 21.5 weight % 
of Cr, 9 weight % of Mo, 2.5 weight % of Fe, 3.7 weight % of 
Nb, balance Ni and unavoidable impurities; a Ni-based alloy 
(hereinafter referred to as "alloy C-276") disclosed in  
 
United States Patent No. 3,203,792 and consisting of 16.1 
weight % of Cr, 16.2 weight % of Mo, 5.2 weight % of Fe, 3.2 
weight % of W, balance Ni and unavoidable impurities; and a 
Ni-based alloy (hereinafter referred to as "alloy C-22") 
disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,533,414 and 
consisting of 21.5 weight % of Cr, 13.2 weight % of Mo, 4.1 
weight % of Fe, 3.1 weight % of W, balance Ni and 
unavoidable impurities. FR-A-2 049 528 describes an alloy composed essentially of 
14.7-18 wt.% chrome, 3.5-9.0 wt.% tantalum, 15-18 wt.% molybdenum, 
0.02-0.15 wt.% carbon, 0.3-1.5 wt.% silicon, 0.3-1.5 
wt.% manganese and optionally tungsten, iron, vanadium, cobalt, 
copper, niobium and nickel. GB-A-2 102 834 relates to an alloy for making a high strength 
deep well casing and tubing having improved resistance to 
stress-corrosion cracking. The composition is characterized 
by 30-60% Ni, 15-35% Cr, 0-12% Mo, 0-24% V, further N, Cu, 
Co, rare earth metals, Y, Mg and Ca as optional components.
