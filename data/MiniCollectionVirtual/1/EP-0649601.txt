<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reduced calorie fruit spread
containing one or more high intensity sweeteners and a multi-component
hydrocolloid mixture.Traditional reduced-calorie, low-solids fruit spread products
are inherently low in sweetness intensity, poor in sweetness quality
and possess a number of textural defects in comparison to their full-calorie
counterparts. These defects are characterized by a grainy,
brittle, thin texture which lacks the desired spreadability and
mouthfeel associated with full-calorie, high-solids products.
Carbohydrate sweeteners such as sucrose provide many of the desired
textural and flavor attributes. Likewise, traditional low calorie,
artificially sweetened fruit spread products possess many of the same
textural and flavor defects as the low-sugar products.High methoxy pectins are used in conventional full calorie high-solids
fruit spread products. These pectins are stable to low pH and
high temperature conditions; however, they do not gel in the absence
of high solids. Most artificially sweetened and low-sugar fruit
spread products (which have lower solids content than full calorie
spreads because of the reduced sugar content) utilize low methoxy
pectin (set with calcium) or carrageenan as the gelling agent.
However, textural defects are apparent in products formulated with
these gelling agents.The use of conventional hydrocolloid systems such as carrageenan
and low methoxy pectin in reduced calorie (low solids) fruit spreads 
only provide a gel structure of poor body and mouthfeel. Conventional
low-solids formulations do not match the textural quality of high-solids
products.Over the past few years, several reduced-calorie aspartame
sweetened fruit spreads have become commercially available. There
is significant room for improvement in the storage stability and
organoleptic properties of these products. Traditional full calorie
fruit spreads usually have pH values of about 3.0 - 3.2. The
commercially available aspartame fruit spreads have pH values of
about 3.6 - 3.7, because at the traditional pH values aspartame would
lack sufficient stability to have a reasonable shelf life. However,
at the higher pH of 3.6 - 3.7, for grape products in particular, the
characteristic tartness/flavor profile exhibited by traditional
products at a pH of 3.0-3.2 is lacking. Also, at the higher pH
values, color stability is decreased for certain fruit spreads such
as grape jelly. The presently available aspartame-containing
spreads, even at the higher pH, are less than fully acceptable
be
