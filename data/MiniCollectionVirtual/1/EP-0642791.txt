<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
remitting or attenuating the symptoms of movement 

disorders which can be secondary to treatment of 
psychiatric disorders with antipsychotic drugs mainly 

neuroleptic, or primary neurological disorders. This 
treatment involves administering a meal enriched with 

large neutral amino acids or a dietary supplement of 
large neutral amino acids to patients suffering from 

these disorders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of
tardive dyskinesia through the manipulation
of the amino acids in the blood plasma pool.Neuroleptic drugs, including haloperidol,
thioridazine, chlorpromazine, flupenazine and
thiothixene, are used as antipsychotics to treat a
number of psychoses, such as schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, organic psychosis, bipolar
disorder, and unipolar depression (severe form). This
represents a sizable portion of Americans, as the
National Institute of Mental Health reports that the
number of patients in the United States with
schizophrenia in 1990 was 1.8 million; bi-polar
disorder, 1.1 million and unipolar depressives (severe
form), 1.7 million. Neuroleptics are also used as
behavioral control measures in the following
non-psychotic populations; children with autism, child
and adolescent psychiatric patients with conduct and
adjustment disorders, the mentally retarded, and
geriatric patients in general hospitals and nursing
homes. In these populations, clinical trials have
established that these agents are effective in the
treatment of symptoms such as; tension, hyperactivity,
combativeness, hostility, negativism, hallucinations,
acute delusions, poor self-care, and sometimes
withdrawal and seclusiveness. Neuroleptics are also
the drug of choice to treat the symptoms of abnormal
movements in primary neurological disorders; such as
for patients with tic disorders (transient tic
disorders, chronic motor tics, Tourettes' disorder)
and those with Huntington's Disorder. Unfortunately, in a large number of individuals,
a variety of movement disorders may develop secondary
to chronic neuroleptic treatment thereby creating a
therapeutic dilemma in the mental health community.
Among these disorders are tardive dyskinesia (TD),
Parkinsonism, tardive dystonia, akathisia and
neuroleptic malignant syndrome.A similar class of drugs, as represented by the
drug methochlorpromide, used as anti-vomiting agents
(particularly for cancer chemotherapy patients) are
also known to cause a similar set of movement
disorders. Additionally, a variety of movement
disorders are seen secondary to other drugs such as
lithium (used for the treatment of bipolar disorder),
anticonvulsants (used for the treatment of seizure
disorders), benzodiazepines (used for the treatment of
anxiety disorders) , and tricyclic antidepressants
(used for the treatment of unipolar depression).Abnormal movements are also seen as primary
neurological disorders. In addition to the two such
conditions mentioned
