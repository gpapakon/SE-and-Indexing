<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection control apparatus that is used in a diesel 
engine or the like, which controls the fuel injection rate by adjusting 

the injection valve opening pressure of the injection nozzle. A 
plurality of different thresholds are set for a signal that corresponds 

to the injection rate in order to identify the reference injection start 
time and the initial injection rate control period through comparison 

of the signal corresponding to the injection rate against these 
thresholds. The injection timing and the injection valve opening 

pressure of the injection nozzle are controlled in such a manner that 
these measured values will match the optimal initial injection rate 

control period and the optimal reference injection start time which are 
stored in memory in advance for individual sets of operating conditions. 

With this, the optimal injection state can be achieved during the 
initial stage (initial injection rate control period ) of the injection 

period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection control
apparatus that is used in a diesel engines and the like and which
controls the fuel injection rate by adjusting the injection valve
opening pressure of each of the injection nozzles.In fuel injection control, in addition to controlling the
injection start time and the injection quantity, it is necessary to
control the injection rate in order to achieve a desired injection
waveform. Among control apparatuses of this type in the prior art,
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication S61-96163, for example, discloses
an apparatus that controls the injection valve opening pressure of the
injection nozzles with hydraulic pressure, achieved in this particular
case by a technology through which deviation of injection rate
characteristics and changes over time are eliminated by feed-back
control of the oil pressure in such a manner that the peak value of the
injection valve opening pressure matches a target value.In a typical pump line nozzle system (a system which supplies
fuel that has been compressed by a fuel injection pump to a nozzle via
piping) or a typical unit injector, the injection quantity output from
the time when the fuel is first injected from the nozzle until it is
ignited (the period preceding the start of the main injection) is
considered to be an important factor in indicating the characteristics
of the fuel system. Alan P. Gill, in "Design Choices for 1990's Low-Emission
Diesel Engines," SAE Technical Paper Series, 880350, notes 
that it has been verified that the smaller the injection
quantity during this initial injection rate control
period, the smaller the discharge of NOx. Consequently,
injection control through the entire injection period,
and in particular, during the initial injection'rate
control period, must be performed in accordance with
various operating conditions such as the engine load, the
rpm and the like.However, the prior art described above performs
control only to the extent that the peak value of the
injection valve opening pressure is matched to a target
value and it is not, therefore, possible to control the
injection characteristics during the initial injection
rate control period with great precision. In order to
overcome this problem, control processing based upon a
new concept is required.In DE-A-3601710, it is proposed to control the
preinjection and main injection by controlling the valve
opening times with respect to length and timing using
only a single constant valve opening pressure.The main object of the
