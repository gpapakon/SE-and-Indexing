<ABSTRACT>
Dielectrically isolated semiconductor devices such as 
DMOS and IGBT devices comprise a substrate having upper and 

lower surfaces. Source, drain and channel regions are 
disposed along the upper surface. The drain region extends 

downwardly to the lower surface of the substrate and 
laterally beneath the source and channel region. The drain 

merges with an underlying region of high conductivity. The 
underlying region is generally flat except for an upwardly 

extending portion thereof laterally disposed from the source 

region and providing a lower resistance path for current 
through the drain region. The DMOS devices can be included 

within an integrated circuit chip containing other types of 
semiconductor devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates primarily to dielectricaly 
isolated devices within semiconductor integrated circuits, 
and particularly, to such devices having "vertical" 
configurations providing high voltage capability. The 
invention also relates to discrete DMOS devices, 
particularly to Double Diffusion Metal Oxide Semiconductor 
(DMOS) and Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) devices. Integrated circuits with which the present invention 
has utility are known. One class of such circuits is 
described in "An Analog/Digital BCDMOS Technology with 
Dielectric Isolation-Devices and Processes", Chih-Yuan Lu, 
et al., IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. 35, No. 
2, Feb. 1988, pages 230-237. In such integrated circuits, 
various different types of semiconductor devices , e.g., 
bipolar, Complimentary MOS (CMOS), DMOS, p-n-p-n, Junction 
FET (JFET) and Dual Gate DMOS (DGDMOS) devices are 
integrated within a single semiconductor chip. This is made 
possible by the use of device structures and processes which 
are compatible with all the different types of devices 
included on the chip, even though not all the devices are 
optimized in their performance. In particular, and with 
respect to the present invention, in order to provide 
certain ones of the devices with high voltage capability, 
particularly the DMOS and IGBT devices (described further 
hereinafter), the devices are formed within deep tubs 
providing large vertical distances for withstanding high 
voltages. Doped regions are formed at both the top and 
bottom surfaces of the tubs, and, in the different devices 
within the chip, the different doped regions provide 
different functions, depending upon the particular devices 
involved. For example, in the DMOS devices, the bottom  
 
doped region serves as a highly conductive channel for 
current passing between source and drain regions of the 
device. In bipolar transistors, the bottom doped region 
serves as the device collector. A problem, however, is that 
while the distance of the bottom doped regions from the 
upper doped regions is optimized for the DMOS devices, such 
distance is generally higher than optimal for the other 
devices within the chip. The present invention has utility for better optimizing 
the dimensions of various devices in integrated circuits of 
the type described above. In addition, the present invention has utility in DMOS 
and IGBT devices in general, whether integrated or not. DMOS devices are well known, wherein the "D" stands for 
"diffusion" or "double
