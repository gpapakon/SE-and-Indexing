<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a normally solid, high molecular weight, 
non-linear, substantially gel-free, propylene polymer material 

characterized by high melt strength due to strain hardening 
which is believed to be caused by free-end long chain branches 

of the molecular chains forming the polymer. 
Also disclosed is a process for making the polymer by 
high energy radiation of a normally solid, high molecular 

weight, linear, propylene polymer in a reduced active oxygen 
environment, maintaining the irradiated material in such 

environment for a specific period of time, and then 
deactivating free radicals in the material. 
Further disclosed is the use of the strain hardening 
polymer in extensional flow operations such as, for example, 

extrusion coating, film production, foaming and thermoforming.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention resides in the chemical arts. More
particularly, it relates to the chemical art having to do with
synthetic resins derived from alpha or 1-olefins. Specifically,
it relates to impact modified synthetic resins, also
known as heterophasic resin, formed by the sequential
polymerization of propylene and other olefins.Radiation of polymer materials as a method of chemical
processing is known in the art. For example, Bohm and
Tveekrem, "The Radiation Chemistry of Elastomers And Its
Industrial Application", Rubber Chemistry and Technology, vol.
55, 575-668, discuss the effect of radiation of elastomers,
such as ethylene-propylene copolymers and terpolymers; and
Harmer and Ballantine, "Applying Radiation to Chemical
Processing", Chemical Engineering, 91-98, May/ 1971 which
describes various types of radiation.The irradiation of elastomers, such as ethylene-propylene
copolymer rubbers or ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer
rubbers is a viable method, or alternative, for crosslinking
said materials, as described in O'Donnell and Whittaker, "The
Radiation Crosslinking and Scission of Ethylene-Propylene
Copolymers Studied by Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",
British Polymer Journal, vol. 17, no.1, 51-55, 1985. The
crosslinking of elastomers is desirable in fabricated parts.
U.S. 4,170,664 describes a process for the production of
cross-linked resilient automotive body components having a
cured surface coating from a thermoplastic elastomeric
composition.It is also known that by irradiating normally solid,
linear, C2-4 alpha-olefin homopolymers and random copolymers of 
propylene with ethylene and/or C4-8 alpha-olefins, according to the processes of
U.S. 4,916,198; 5,047,446 and 5,047,485, polymers are obtained having high
melt strength or strain hardening (an increased resistance to stretching during
elongation of the molten material) without crosslinking and gelation.However, when irradiated C2-4 alpha-olefin homopolymers and random
copolymers of propylene with ethylene and/or C4-8 alpha-olefins are blended with
irradiated or non-irradiated elastomers to obtain better impact strength, the melt
strength suffers.The irradiation of heterophasic resins by conventional radiation methods has
resulted in an heterophasic resin having melt strength, but severe gelation and
high degree of crosslinking, which are undesirable in foam applications.Thus, there is a need for high rubber heterophasic resins having good melt
strength without substantial gelation or high degree of crosslinking.This invention
