<ABSTRACT>
The guide tube (9) for the striker piston has additional radially extending air passages (11) which are distributed circumferentially along at least one additional plane (E2) spaced apart from the plane (E1) of location of the first air passages (10). The two planes run parallel to each other. All the additional passages have the same cross-section which corresponds to the cross-section of the first passages.

<CLAIMS>
Drilling and/or chiselling tool comprising a striking mechanism (6), the piston (7) of which reciprocates a striker (19) guided in a guide tube (9) and cooperating with a plunger (17) by means of an air cushion, the guide tube (9) being provided between the piston (7) and the striker (19) with a plurality of radially extending air passages (10) of identical cross section distributed around the circumference along a first plane (E1) extending perpendicularly to the machining direction, which air passages can be covered by a control body displaceable parallel to the machining direction and cooperating with the plunger (17), 
characterised in that
 the guide tube (9) is provided between the piston (7) and the striker (19) with further radially extending air passages (11) distributed around the circumference along at least one further plane (E2) arranged at a distance from the first plane (E1) in the opposite direction to the machining direction, the planes (E1, E2) extending essentially in parallel.
Tool according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a plurality of further air passages (11) are distributed around the circumference along the further planes (E1, E2).
Tool according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the further air passages (11) are distributed in a uniform manner around the respective circumference.
Tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 all of the further air passages (11) have the same cross section.
Tool according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the cross section of each further air passage (11) corresponds essentially to the cross section of each air passage (10).
