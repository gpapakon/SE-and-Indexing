<ABSTRACT>
Aromatic diamines, such as toluenediamine, are 
alkylated in the ortho position by heating an aromatic 

diamine in the presence of an aluminum alloy, aluminum 
chloride and zinc, and then reacting with 

an alkene at elevated temperatures and pressures. In 
one embodiment, toluenediamine, diethyltoluenediamine or 

mixtures thereof are heated with an aluminum alloy, 
aluminum chloride and zinc having an average particle 

diameter of from 75 to 850 microns, 20 to 200 mesh, U.S. 
Standard to form a catalyst system. This is reacted 

with ethene and toluenediamine to form diethyltoluenediamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the alkylation of aromatic amines, particularly the 
ortho-alkylation of aromatic diamines. Processes for the preparation of ortho-alkylated 
aromatic amines from alkenes are known in the 
art. In one process, aluminum is dissolved in aniline 
to form aluminum anilide which serves as a catalyst for 
the alkylation of the aniline or of other aromatic 
amines. Such a process is taught in U. S. Patent 
3,649,693 to Napolitano. Napolitano teaches that the 
alkylation itself is conducted at significantly elevated 
temperatures and pressures. Various other references 
have taught that the addition of mercury chloride, 
various Friedel Crafts catalysts, iodine or iodine 
compounds are helpful in improving the efficiency of the 
reaction. U. S. Patent 4,760,185 to Becker teaches 
heating a diamine with an aluminum/zinc alloy and 
aluminum chloride in the absence of aniline until the 
evolution of hydrogen is complete. According to this U.S. Patent it is critical to use an Al/Zn alloy 
and other aluminum alloys are held to be unsuitable for the 
production of an ortho-alkylation catalyst. This Al/Zn catalyst 
is then reacted with a lower alkene at  
 
significantly elevated pressure and temperature to form 
the alkylated phenylenediamine. The methods known for the ortho-alkylation of 
aromatic diamines require substantially elevated 
reaction pressures and temperatures; require the 
presence of environmentally questionable substances such 
as mercury chloride; require expensive catalysts or 
require some combination of these factors. Thus what is 
needed is a method for the ortho-alkylation of aromatic 
amines which utilizes less expensive, less toxic 
catalysts and which utilizes relatively mild alkylation 
conditions. The present invention involves a catalyst 
useful in a process for the ortho-alkylation of aromatic 
amines wherein the catalyst is prepared by heating an 
amine with 
(1) an aluminum/magnesium alloy having a magnesium content 
from 0.5 to 30 weight percent; (2) a Friedel Crafts catalyst selected from aluminum 
chloride, SnCl4, SiCl4, ZrI4, FeCl3 and BCl3; (3) zinc; and (4) optionally, a solvent.  
The completion of catalyst formation is indicated by the 
completion of the evolution of hydrogen. The present 
invention also involves the catalyst prepared by this 
method. This invention also involves a process for the 
ortho-alkylation of aromatic amines wherein all or a 
portion of the catalyst prepared as described above is  
 
reacted, optionally
