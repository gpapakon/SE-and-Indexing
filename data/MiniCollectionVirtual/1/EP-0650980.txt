<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating. The coating is preferably a floor
polish which exhibits detergent resistance and removability.In polish and coatings applications where durability and toughness are
important, polymers employing metal ions as crosslinking agents have traditionally
been used. These metal containing polymers allowed the formulator to produce
polish and coatings compositions with all necessary formulation ingredients in a
single-package system. The single-package system allows the formulator to use the
coating at the site without additional mixing and preparation, and at a lower cost,
when compared to multi-package compositions. More recently, however, metal
containing coatings have come under extreme pressure from both federal and state
governments due to environmental concerns. In an attempt to address these
concerns, formulators are demanding from raw material suppliers, polymers which
provide equivalent performance without the use of metal ions. In response to the
environmental concerns, formulators have increased their use of non-metal
containing, single-package emulsion polymer systems.However, when single-packaged emulsion polymers are cured under ambient
conditions, and their performance is compared to metal-containing polymer
systems, emulsion polymers suffer inherent shortcomings with respect to durability,
toughness and resistance, such as, for example, pad induced scratching from floor
machine maintenance procedures. Therefore, aqueous-based, non-metal containing
coatings have not found wide acceptance in polish and coating applications where
strength, durability and toughness are important. Another shortcoming of aqueous-based
no metal containing systems is the need for multiple package systems in order
to obtain the equivalent performance of a metal-containing system. Multiple
package systems require the end-user to mix components just prior to the coatings
application. Often, the use of multiple package systems are impractical and the
formulator fails to obtain a proper mix of the components, resulting in coatings that
are deficient in properties such as removability of the coating for cleaning purposes.It is generally known that incorporation of silane functionality into a polymer
can yield compositions which self-crosslink at ambient temperature or about 25Â°
Centigrade. Crosslinking occurs due to the facile hydrolysis of alkoxysilane groups
to silanols and their subsequent condensation to form Si-O-Si linkages in the
presence of water (See e.g., Feasibility of
