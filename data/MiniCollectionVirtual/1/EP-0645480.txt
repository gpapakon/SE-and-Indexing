<ABSTRACT>
An ultrafine fiber with a network structure, wherein the defect of an olefin polymer and that of an ester 
polymer have been offset while utilizing the merits of both polymers; and a nonwoven fabric constituted thereof and 

having a dense structure. This fiber is produced from a mixture consisting at least of an olefin polymer and an ester 
polymer which are mutually incompatible and has a network structure. It is highly fibrillated to such an extent as 

has been unattainable heretobefore, has high strength and modulus, and is dyeable. The nonwoven fabric contains 
network-structure fibers of a mixture of an olefin polymer with an ester polymer incompatible therewith in a ratio 

of 5/95 to 95/5, and these fibers are bonded to each other wholly or partly. It is excellent in strength, moisture 
permeability and water pressure resistance and is dyeable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fine denier filament
having a plexifilamentary structure composed of a mixture of
polymers which are not miscible each other, to nonwoven fabric
comprising said filament and having a fine fibrillated
structure and also to their production, known, for instance,
from US-A-5 147 586.With respect to a method of manufacturing fine denier
filaments and nonwoven fabric using said filaments, it has
been known that multi-component filaments of a sea-island type
are subjected to a spinning followed by removing a part of the
polymer components therefrom using a solvent and the resulting
filaments are subjected to a bonding to afford nonwoven
fabric. It has been also known to use the so-called melt-blowing
method in which a molten polymer is extruded from
spinning nozzles followed by drafting with a heated fluid to
fibrillate. However, in a method in which a part of the
polymer components of the multi-component filaments is removed
using a solvent, various steps are necessary. According to a
melt-blowing method, it is true to give very fine filaments
but, since said melt-blowing method conducts the fibrillation
at the stage of molten polymer, there are disadvantages of
little drawing orientation and crystallization whereby the 
resulting filaments are mechanically very weak.On the other hand, the so-called flash-spinning method
has been known for preparing very fine filaments from a
solution of polymers. As disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,081,519,
said method of flash-spinning is a method in which a solution
of a polymer in a low-boiling solvent is extruded from
spinning nozzles to evaporate the solvent instantly.However, the filaments prepared by such a formulation
are composed of one polymer component for any of the materials
and, therefore, there is a problem that they have a
disadvantage inherent to the polymer resulting in a
restriction in the development of the use of the product. The
art which is disclosed in the Japanese Examined Patent
Publication 41/006,215-B and the Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication 01/097,256-A has the same problem too. To be more
precise, polyolefins are excellent in terms of their light
weights but are with low modulus whereby they lack the good
feel on use and putting on and have specific smoothness while
polyesters are the polymers which are inherently suitable for
preparing filaments of high tenacity and are with high modulus
but they do not give filaments with high tenacity by a method
of flash-spinning whereupon they have not been actually used.
