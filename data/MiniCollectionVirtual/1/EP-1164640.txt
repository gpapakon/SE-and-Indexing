<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device having
an MIS capacitor having a low capacitance value and an MIS

capacitor having a high capacitance value, and to a
manufacturing method thereof. According to this invention, in a

semiconductor device having a first MIS capacitor and a second
MIS capacitor having a higher capacitance than the capacitance

of the first MIS capacitor formed on a substrate, the first MIS
capacitor consists of a lower conductive material region formed

on the substrate, a multilayer dielectric film consisting of a
first insulating film, serving as both an interlayer insulating

film and a dielectric film, and a second insulating film serving
as a dielectric film of the second MIS capacitor, and an upper

conductive material film, and the capacitance of the first MIS
capacitor is determined by an area of the dielectric film formed

by the second insulating film.
In a manufacturing method, a first conductive material
region and a second conductive material region are formed by

doping a semiconductor substrate with impurities; the first
insulating film, serving as both the interlayer insulating film

and the dielectric film, is formed on the first and second
conductive material regions; an opening portion of the first

insulating film on the second conductive material region is
formed; the second insulating film, serving as a part of the

dielectric film of the first MIS capacitor and the dielectric
film of the second MIS capacitor, is formed on the first

insulating film and in the opening portion; a conductive 

material film, serving as an upper electrode of the first MIS
capacitor and an upper electrode of the second MIS capacitor, is

formed on the second insulating film; and the capacitance of the
first MIS capacitor is determined by the formation area of the

conductive material film.
By doing so, the semiconductor device comprised of the
first MIS capacitor having a capacitance value of 100 fF or less

and the second MIS capacitor having a capacitance value
exceeding 100 fF can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device
and a semiconductor device manufacturing method, and more
specifically relates to a semiconductor device comprising a
plurality of insulator capacitors and a manufacturing method
thereof.A conventional example of an insulator capacitor (to be
referred to as "MIS capacitor" hereinafter) will be described
with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4 shows an MIS capacitor device
formed in, for example, a bipolar IC. For example, in FIG. 4,
an N type epitaxial layer 122 is formed on a P type
semiconductor substrate 121, and a silicon oxide layer or so-called
LOCOS 123 formed by local oxidation of silicon and a
device isolation diffusion layer 124 consisting of a P type
diffusion layer and formed below the LOCOS 123, both of which
layers become a device isolation region, are formed on the
epitaxial layer 122. The device isolation diffusion layer 124
is formed to reach the semiconductor substrate 121. An N type
semiconductor region 113 doped with N type impurities is formed
on the epitaxial layer 122 defined by the device isolation
region. A conventional MIS capacitor 101 is constituted by
forming an opening portion 127 in a first interlayer insulating
film 126 formed on a surface including a portion on the
semiconductor region 113 with the semiconductor region 113 
serving as a lower electrode, forming an insulating film (or a
so-called dielectric film) 111 on the semiconductor region 113
facing this opening portion 127, and forming an upper electrode
112 of a polysilicon film on the insulating film 111. Further,
a second interlayer insulating film 128 is formed to cover the
upper electrode 112, a wiring 130 connected to the upper
electrode 112 through an opening portion formed at a position in
the second interlayer insulating film 128, which position
corresponds to the upper electrode 112, is formed, and a wiring
131 connected to the lower electrode 113 through an opening
portion formed at positions in the first and second interlayer
insulating films 126 and 128, which positions correspond to the
lower electrode 113, is formed.In case of this MIS capacitor 101, the effective area
thereof is determined according to the area of the opening
portion 127 in the first interlayer insulating film 126, and the
capacitance value thereof is determined according to the
property and thickness of the insulating film (or dielectric
film) 111 provided in the opening portion 127. Actually,
however, even on the peripheral portion of the opening portion
127, a parasitic capacitance
