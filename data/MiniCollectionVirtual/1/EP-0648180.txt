<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser (Sp) for pasty materials (3), such as tooth paste, has a head piece (7) with an outlet (4) and an actuating surface (6). A transport piston (8) gradually wanders under air pressure in the direction of the outlet (4) and pushes the material (3) before it with its front side (9). In order to obtain a simple design and a reliable operation of the dispenser, the transport piston (8) is moved by an air overpressure (zone D) that accumulates behind the transport piston (8) when the dispenser is actuated.

Dispenser (Sp) for dispensing pasty compositions (3) 
such as e.g. toothpaste, with an outer housing (1) with an 

open upper side and a closed bottom (14), wherein in the 
latter is arranged an air inlet valve (V) which opens in 

case of partial pressure in the outer housing (1), wherein 
there is further provided an inner housing (2) which 

projects upwardly out of the outer housing (1) and which 
comprises on its headpiece (7) an actuating surface (6) and 

a mouthpiece opening (4), by means of which actuating 
surface (6) the inner housing (2) can be pressed against 

spring pressure into the outer housing (1) which is sealed 
off from it, so that under this actuation a transport 

piston (8) which travels in the inner housing (2) in the 
direction (arrow x) of the mouthpiece opening (4) pushes 

the composition (3) in front of it as a result of an excess 
air pressure built up on the rear side thereof, characterised 

in that the inner housing (2) is constructed as a 
sleeve which opens towards the bottom (14) of the outer 

housing (1), the bottom (14) of the outer housing (1) is 
removable, and sealing of the inner housing (2) takes place 

by a counterpiston (11) rigidly connected to the bottom 
(14) of the outer housing (1) and extending into the inner 

housing (2). 
Dispenser according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the excess air pressure is built up by approach of the rear 

side (10) of the transport piston (8) to the counterpiston 
(11) fixed to the housing, wherein the space (12) between 

the two pistons (8, 11) can be made to communicate with the 
atmosphere by the valve (V) which opens on increase of the 

distance between the pistons (8, 11). 
Dispenser according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the counterpiston (11) is 

mounted on a base (13) of an outer housing (1), relative to  
 

which the inner housing (2) is slidable against spring bias 
in such a way that the base (13) moves into the lower end 

of the inner housing (2) which with its actuating surface 
(6) protrudes beyond the upper edge (28) of the outer 

housing (1). 
Dispenser according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a compression spring (27) between 

the lower edge (29) of the inner housing (2) and the bottom 
(14) of the outer housing (1). 
Dispenser according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the bottom (14) and base (13) of the outer housing (1) 

can be bolted onto the lower end of the housing peripheral 
wall (15). 
Dispenser according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in 
that the inner end of the compression spring (27) is 

covered by an annular guide piece (30). 
Dispenser according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the cross-section of the guide piece (30) is U-shaped and 

the lower edge (29) of the inner housing (2) rests on the 
web (32) of the U. 
Dispenser according to one or more of claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that the lower edge (29) of the inner 

housing (2) is biased by the compression spring (27) 
against a stop (33) of the outer housing (1). 
Dispenser according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the stop (33) continues into longitudinal guide ribs (34) 

for the inner housing (2). 
Dispenser according to one or more of claims 3 to 9, 
characterised in that the valve (V) is mounted in the top 

(19) of the base (13) which is designed as an open-bottomed  
 

recess of the bottom (14). 
Dispenser according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the top (19) is framed by a piston ring and the latter 

forms together with it the counterpiston (11). 
Dispenser according to claim 11, characterised in that 
the valve closure body (22) of the air inlet valve (V) is 

connected by webs (25) to the piston ring. 
Dispenser (Sp) for dispensing pasty compositions (3) 
such as e.g. toothpaste, with an outer housing (1) with an 

open upper side and a closed bottom (14), wherein in the 
latter is arranged an air inlet valve (V) which opens in 

case of partial pressure in the outer housing (1), wherein 
there is further provided an inner housing (2) which 

projects upwardly out of the outer housing (1) and which 
comprises on its headpiece (7) an actuating surface (6) and 

a mouthpiece opening (4), by means of which actuating 
surface (6) the inner housing (2) can be pressed against 

spring pressure into the outer housing (1) which is sealed 
off from it, so that under this actuation a transport 

piston (8) which travels in the inner housing (2) in the 
direction (arrow x) of the mouthpiece opening (4) pushes 

the composition (3) in front of it as a result of an excess 
air pressure built up on the rear side thereof, characterised 

in that the inner housing (2) is constructed as a 
sleeve which opens towards the bottom
 (14) of the outer 
housing (1), the bottom (14) of the outer housing (1) is 

removable, and sealing of the inner housing (2) takes place 
by a bellows (B) connecting the open end of the sleeve wall 

of the inner housing (2) to the bottom (14) of the outer 
housing (1). 
Dispenser according to claim 13, characterised in that 
the air inlet valve (V) is mounted on a base (13) which is 

overrun by the inner housing (2) and which forms a  
 

retaining projection (44) for the upper edge (41) of the 
bellows (B). 
Dispenser according to claim 14, characterised in that 
the base (13) extends from the bottom (14) of a screw-on 

cap (40), on which bottom (14) is sealingly supported the 
lower edge (38) of the bellows (B). 
Dispenser according to one or more of claims 13 to 15, 
characterised in that the bellows (B) is the return spring 

of the inner housing (2).
