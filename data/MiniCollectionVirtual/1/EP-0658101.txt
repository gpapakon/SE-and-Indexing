<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel aerosol formulations for administering drugs, in
particular for administration of a beclomethasone ester by inhalation.Beclomethasone dipropionate is 9α-chloro-16β-methyl-1,4-pregnadiene-11β,
17α,21-triol-3,20-dione 17α,21-dipropionate and may be represented by the
formula (I)
The corticosteroid of formula (I) is known to exhibit topical antiinflammatory
activity and is useful in the treatment of asthmatic conditions, particularly in the
form of aerosol formulations. The use of such formulations is described in GB-1429184
where it is noted that micronised anhydrous beclomethasone
dipropionate tends to display crystal growth, due to solvate formation, when
incorporated into aerosol formulations containing chlorofluorocarbon
propellants. Crystals having a particle size of more than 20 microns were
shown to be too large to penetrate the bronchial system and prone to cause
clogging of the metering valve making them unsuitable for administration by
inhalation.A number of potential solutions to this problem have been proposed. These
include the use of micronised solvates of beclomethasone dipropionate for
example chlorofluorocarbon solvates (GB-1429184), ethyl acetate solvate (DE-3018550OS).
C5-8alkane solvates (EP-0039369), diisopropyl ether solvate (EP-0172672) 
and C1-5 alcohol solvates (WO86/03750). GB-2076422A discloses a
process for the preparation of chlorofluorocarbon aerosols which incorporates a
low temperature (5 to -40°C) step which is also claimed to inhibit crystal growth.An alternative solution to the problem of crystal growth in aerosol formulations
containing beclomethasone dipropionate has recently been disclosed in
WO92/06675. This document describes the preparation of aerosol formulations
containing solutions of beclomethasone diproprionate in ethanol, together with
hydrofluorocarbon 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) or hydrofluorocarbon 227
(1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) as propellant. Since a solution of
beclomethasone dipropionate in ethanol is employed in the aerosols rather than
a suspension of particulate beclomethasone diproprionate, elaborate process
steps or the preparation of a solvate of the active ingredient prior to
incorporation into the aerosol formulation is not required.Nevertheless, whilst ethanol is pharmaceutically acceptable and generally
recognised as safe, it is associated with a number of disadvantages which may
restrict is use. In particular, administration of ethanol-containing products to
teetotal or alcohol-dependent
