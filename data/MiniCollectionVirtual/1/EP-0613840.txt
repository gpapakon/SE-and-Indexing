<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic roller, comprised of a shell (2) and a shaft (1) passing 
through the 

shell (2), characterized by at least one ball-and-socket joint between 
the shell and 

the shaft. At least one end cap (3,4) is placed at an end of the shell 
(2) and mounted 

on the shaft (1). A ball-and-socket joint (8) is provided between the 
shell (2) and the 

end caps (3,4) or between the shaft and the end caps. The ball-and-socket 
joint (8) 

is preferably obtained by the provision of an annular collar having a 
rounded 

cross section (9,12) mounted between the truncated conical bearing 
surface (6) of the shell (2) and the end caps (3,4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally concerns a roller mounted on bearings, and 
is specifically concerned with a ball and socket joint between a ceramic 
roller and the bearings for eliminating localized stresses that can cause the 
roller to chip. Rollers designed to support loads such as a metal strip in a heat-treatment 
furnace in which the strip is to be annealed at a relatively high 
temperature are already known. Such rollers are comprised of a cylinder of 
ceramic refractory material. An end cap mounted rotatably on a bearing is 
fixed at each end of the ceramic cylinder. U.S. patent 4,399,598 describes a 
ceramic roller for transporting glass sheets through a heat treatment. The 
cylinder is mounted rotatably on bearings by means of end caps mounted with 
play at each end of the cylinder. One or more radially compressible split 
metal rings are placed in the space between the outside diameter of the 
cylinder and the inside diameter of the end cap. A roller of similar type is 
also disclosed in U.S. patent 4,404,011; it is comprised of a cylinder of 
refractory material at the ends to which metallic end caps are fixed. Play is 
provided between the end caps and the cylinder. Flat leaf springs are placed 
around the periphery of this play. These known systems of the prior art make it possible to take up the 
differential expansion between the roller and the end caps when the roller is 
exposed to heat. When heated, the cylinder of refractory material expands 
practically not at all while, on the other hand, the metallic end caps expand 
greatly. The play between the cylinder and the end caps consequently varies 
substantially as a function of the temperature. This is why it is necessary to  
 
provide resilient devices in this space that prevent backlash from occurring 
between the end caps and roller over a broad range of temperature. However, these prior art systems have the shortcoming of not assuring 
coaxiality between the end caps and the cylinder under load. In effect, when 
the cylinder supports 1 load, the resilient devices, whether involving the split 
rings disclosed in U.S. patent 4,399,598 or the leaf springs of U.S. patent 
4,404,011, are deformed such that the end caps are displaced angularly with 
respect to the axis of the cylinder, thus causing the cylinder of the roller to 
rotate eccentrically with respect to the bearings. To remedy these disadvantages, a roller corresponding to the entering clause 
of claim 1 or claim 9 having an end cap with a 
conical joint was developed as shown in
