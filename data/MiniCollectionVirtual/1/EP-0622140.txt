<ABSTRACT>
Device for extraction, by casting (pouring) with controlled (adjustable) flow, of a material smelted in a cold crucible furnace, this furnace including at least one part of the bottom, around the casting orifice (port), cooled by a circulation of water, and a source of heat capable of smelting the material to be smelted, including:   - in the bottom of the furnace (18), an orifice, of which the diameter D is greater than or equal to the thickness H of the wall constituting the furnace; - a metal sleeve (20), of which the base includes a shoulder (21) capable of being adapted to the lateral walls of the orifice, this sleeve having a central passage which constitutes the casting tube for the material which has been smelted, clearance being provided between the lateral walls of the orifice and the base of the sleeve (20) in order to accommodate an insulating material (22) between the sleeve and the cold bottom of the furnace; - under the bottom (18) of the furnace, a device (26), with a cooled sliding blade, equipped with an actuator (32) controlling its displacement in translation along the orifice, thus determining its greater or lesser degree of closure or opening.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the extraction by pouring of a molten material in a cold
structure melter, said melter having a floor (18), provided with an orifice,

and metal walls at least partly cooled by a circulation of water, a heat
source able to melt the material to be melted and, beneath the melter floor

(18), a device (26) having at least one cooled, sliding blade, equipped with
an actuator (32) controlling its displacement in translation along the

orifice, characterized in that:

said orifice has a diameter (D) equal to or greater than the thickness
(H) of the wall constituting the melter,
it comprises a metal sleeve (20), whose base has a shoulder (21) which can
be adapted to the side walls of the orifice, said sleeve (20) having a

central passage constituting the pouring tube for the molten material,
a clearance being provided between the side walls of the orifice and the

base of the sleeve in order to house an insulating material (22) between
the sleeve and the cold floor of the melter,
the displacement in translation of the sliding blade determining the
more or less pronounced opening or closing state of the orifice, so as

to regulate the flow rate of the molten material.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the sliding blade (26)
has an inclined leading edge (34).
Device according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
the metal sleeve (20) has, at its inner base, a conical portion (24) widened

in the direction of the orifice.
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the sliding blade is made from refractory steel and the sleeve from

molybdenum.
