<ABSTRACT>
A temperature sensitive fluid indicator (10) comprises an 
envelope (11) formed of two layers of transparent polymeric 

film material which are welded one to another in a matrix of 
welds (12) to provide an array of cells (13) each containing a 

temperature sensitive fluid. The fluid may be an emulsion 
and indicia in the form of a colour, or a word such as "VOID", 

or a pattern may be reverse printed on an inner surface of one 
of the layers so as to be visible through the cells (13) and 

through the other of the layers when the emulsion changes to a 
matrix phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a temperature sensitive fluid 
indicator and a method of manufacturing same. In each of US-A-2 971 852 and US-A-4 825 447 there is 
disclosed a temperature sensitive fluid indicator comprising 
an envelope containing a fluid and the fluid includes a 
substance the visual characteristics of which change and are 
visible through the envelope when the fluid is subjected to a 
change of temperature beyond a predetermined temperature. In 
US-A-2 971 852 the fluid is an emulsion which changes in 
opacity when subjected to a change of temperature beyond a 
predetermined temperature. In US-A-4 825 447 the fluid is a 
liposome thermographic composition which effects a colour 
change when a self-quenching fluorescent dye loaded into 
liposomes releases into a surrounding liquid medium when 
subjected to a change of temperature beyond a predetermined 
temperature. The dye is diluted by the liquid medium and 
fluoresces. Such indicators have potential for a wide range of products. 
They may, for example, be used to indicate whether frozen food 
products and emulsion based paints and inks have been 
subjected to temperatures outside of a predetermined range and 
they may be used to indicate whether security packages have 
been tampered with by subjecting a package or a seal of the 
package to a temperature lower than a predetermined  
 
temperature rendering an adhesive closure temporarily 
ineffective. However, the potential is not generally satisfied because the 
indicators are not adapted for high volume, low cost 
production and for ease of manufacture of products. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
temperature sensitive fluid indicator comprising an envelope 
containing a fluid and the fluid includes a substance the 
visual characteristics of which change and are visible through 
the envelope when the fluid is subjected to a change of 
temperature beyond a predetermined range characterised in that 
the envelope comprises a plurality of cells. If the fluid is an emulsion, containment of the emulsion in a 
plurality of small cells instead of a single larger sachet 
restricts movement of the fluid. This is advantageous if the 
indicator is to be adapted for security purposes because it 
would be difficult by manipulation of the material of the 
cells to re-emulsify the fluid which had changed from an 
opaque emulsion phase to a clear matrix phase and revealed a 
warning indicator. If the fluid is an emulsion or a liposome 
composition, containment of the fluid in a

<CLAIMS>
A temperature sensitive fluid indicator (10) comprising 
an envelope (11) containing a fluid and the fluid 

includes a substance the visual characteristics of which 
change and are visible through the envelope (11) when 

the fluid is subjected to a change of temperature beyond 
a predetermined range characterised in that the envelope 

(11) comprises a plurality of cells (13). 
An indicator (10) as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the envelope (11) comprises an intermediate film 

located between two outer films, the intermediate film 
being a mesh. 
An indicator (10) as Claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 
characterised in that the envelope comprises at least 

part of a product (14). 
An indicator (10) as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in 
that the envelope (11) is provided with means (16) for 

uniting the envelope (11) with a surface. 
An indicator (10) as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in 
that the said means (16) is an adhesive. 
An indicator (10) as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in 
that the envelope (11) comprises a wall of the product. 
An indicator (10) as claimed in any one of Claims 3 to 6 
wherein the product (14) is a security package. 
An indicator (10) as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims characterised in that the material is a high 

moisture barrier film. 
An indicator (10) as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims characterised in that each of the cells (13) is 

less than 2mm in any dimension. 
A method of manufacturing fluid indicators (10) 
comprising the steps of sealing together along marginal 

edges two strips of polymeric film material thereby to 
form an envelope (11), inserting a fluid into the 

envelope (11) and welding opposite facing surfaces of the 
envelope (11) one to another in a matrix of welds (12) to 

form a component comprising a plurality of cells (13) 
containing the fluid. 
A method as claimed in Claim 10 comprising the step of 
including with the two strips a third intermediate strip 

in the form of a mesh.
