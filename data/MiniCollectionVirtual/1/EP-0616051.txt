<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cleaning process, in particular for a component which is especially a steam generator. In this case, a complexing agent is used. It is envisaged that, for the removal of metallic lead, the lead is oxidised and the resulting lead compound is converted into a complex, while lead is still being oxidised. For this purpose, the complexing agent used is a salt of a complex-forming acid and an alkalising agent in aqueous solution. The pH value of this solution can be between 8 and 11. After the formation of a lead complex, the resulting solution is removed.

<CLAIMS>
Method for removing metallic lead from a 
component of a power station, in particular from a 

steam generator, with the aid of a complexing agent, 
characterised in that by blowing in oxygen, air or 

another oxygen-containing gas, the metallic lead is 
oxidized, the lead compound which results from the 

oxidation is complexed, while more lead is being 
oxidized, with a salt consisting of a complexing acid 

and an alkalizing agent in aqueous solution being used 
as a complexing agent, and in that after this the 

solution which results is removed. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the aqueous solution has a pH value between 8 and 

11. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that ammonium-EDTA salt and/or 

ammonium-PDTA salt in aqueous solution is used as a 
complexing agent. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that air is supplied continuously. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in order to support the oxidation 

of the metallic lead, an iron-III salt is added. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in 
that in order to support the oxidation of the metallic 

lead, a solution of the iron-III salt is added to the 
EDTA and/or to the PDTA. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that four hours to forty-eight hours 

are required. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the temperature amounts to 

between 20°C and 160°C.
