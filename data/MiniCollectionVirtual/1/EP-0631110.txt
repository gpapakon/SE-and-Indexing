identifying an object reflector by emitting a light from a 

polarized light source toward the object reflector and then 
detecting a reflected light from the object reflector 

characterized in that the light emitted from said polarized 
light source is a polarized light of which direction of 

polarization is specially defined, the polarized lights between 
said reflected light and said emitted light are different in 

the direction of polarization, and said object reflector 
detecting apparatus is adaped to detect only a component of the 

direction of polarization from said object reflector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an object reflector
detecting apparatus for determining the position of markings or
installations by emitting a light from a polarized light source
and then by detecting a specified reflector.The object reflector detecting apparatus has been used
for determining the hight level in the works of the civil
engineering or the architecture.Recently, a semiconductor visible laser has been put to
practical use and thus an object reflector detecting apparatus
using the semiconductor visible laser has been developed.
However, the output of the semiconductoe visible laser is
limited in view of safety of a worker and therefore the
measurement accompanied with confirmation by visual observation
is limited within a relatively short working distance.Japanese Patent Application No. 289042/1992 filed on
October 27, 1992 discloses a rotary laser irradiating apparatus
in which the position of a specified reflector arranged at a
predetermined position is reciprocally scanned by a laser beam
in order to extend the working distance. In the rotary laser irradiating apparatus disclosed in
Japanese Patent Application No. 289042/1992, a specfied pattern
is formed on the reflector in order to surely detect the object
reflector.However, since the object reflector detecting apparatus
is used in various places, it is impossible to discriminate if
the reflected signal pattern is that from the object reflector
or from a non-object reflector and therefore it is difficult to
perfectly exactly identify the object reflector and the non-object
reflector and thus a scanning operation would be
sometimes caused at an erroneous position.Especially, when the laser beam from the rotary laser
irradiating apparatus perpendicularly strike a non-object
reflector having a reflecting surface such as a glittering
member, the incident optical axis and the reflection optical
axis correspond with each other and thus an intensive reflected
light (hereinafter referred to "regular reflection light")
enters into a detecting section of the apparatus. Accordingly,
when the regular reflection light would take an arrangement
similar to that of the predetermined pattern signal, the
scanning error will be caused although the distance between the
apparatus and the non-object reflector is long.In addition, when there is any glitter flat member such
as a glass plate near a working site, an other optical path
would be sometimes formed between the apparatus and the
specified reflector. In such a case, there is a problem that an
