<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recording and
reproducing a digital pattern as a sound track for a
motion picture film, and the motion picture film with the
digital pattern recorded thereon.In a conventional motion picture film such as
shown in FIG. 16 of the accompanying drawings, the
recording format has a large number of picture-recording
areas (frames) 201 arranged in its longitudinal direction,
that is along the direction of film travel (the film
running direction). Audio signals related to the pictures
recorded in the picture recording areas are recorded in
the analog sound track areas 202 along side the
picture-recording areas in the film running direction.
This arrangement is prescribed in SMPTE standards. In the
analog sound tracks, audio signals temporally coincident
with the picture recorded in the picture recording areas
(frames) are recorded at a position 20.5 frames ahead of
the picture. This is done to account for the fact that
the audio tracks are read by a playback assembly which is
located between the projection assembly and the
projector's take-up reel (20.5 frames ahead of the
projected frame. During playback, the 
picture and associated audio are thus played back
simultaneously.In this conventional motion picture film, left and right
channel audio signals are recorded with temporal correlation.
As shown in Figure 16, the audio signals are recorded in the
analog sound track 202 at a position 20.5 frames ahead of the
corresponding picture frame so that the audio signals can be
temporally coincident with the picture recorded in the picture
recording areas 201. However, a problem can occur if data are
lost at the junction of hand-cut editing or due to scratches
running vertically with respect to the film running direction,
the playback capability of left and right channel audio signals
is lost and therefore, sound interruption can occur. In other
words, when a hand-cut edit is performed as a basic technique
for film editing or repair, it may occur that audio signals are
still left on the analog sound track 202 though a corresponding
frame picture 201 has been already removed by editing, or that
audio signals are cut out by editing though a corresponding
frame picture still exists on the film.FR-A-2 512 973 discloses a soundtrack that is
recorded down two sides of a film with a spatial shift
between temporally similar areas. However, the same mono
soundtrack is recorded twice making high quality stereo
reproduction impossible.Attempts have been made to provide areas for digital audio
data in
