<ABSTRACT>
A method for lining a branch pipe (3) comprising the 
steps of:

 
preparing a tubular liner bag (4) by sewing a rectangular 

nonwoven resin-absorbent fabric (5) into a tubular shape 
with one end closed; attaching an impermeable plastic 

film over the external surface of this tubular liner bag; 
soaking the nonwoven resin-absorbent fabric with a 

hardenable fluid resin; everting the liner bag into the 
branch pipe until the eversion head (4b) of the liner bag 

is stopped by the inner wall of the main pipe; forcing 
the eversion head of the liner bag to turn downstream in 

the main pipe, thus allowing the liner bag to evert 
entirely; hardening the hardenable fluid resin while 

inflating the liner bag; and removing that portion of the 
liner bag which protrudes into the main pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for lining a pipe by 
applying a lining material on the inner wall of the pipe, and in 
particular the invention relates to a method for lining a branch 
pipe branching off a main pipe. When an underground pipe, such as pipelines and passageways, 
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is 
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the 
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging 
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and 
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically, 
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication 
(Kokai) No. 60-242038. According to this publication, this method of pipe repair comprises 
inserting a sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the 
pipe to be repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, like air and 
water. The tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent 
material impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer 
surface covered with an impermeable plastic film. 
More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular 
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the 
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed end 
of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open end of 
the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked (anchored) at 
the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner such that the 
wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly covers and  
 
closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed into the 
pipe; then, the pressurized fluid is applied to the said portion of 
the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular liner to 
enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is hooked at 
the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of the 
flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper in 
the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of insertion shall be called 
"everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner bag is 
everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the control rope 
holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to thereby control 
the length of the tubular liner in the pipe. Then, the everted 
tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall of the pipe by the 
said pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible liner is hardened 
as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the liner is heated, 
which is effected by heating the fluid filling the tubular liner 
bag by

A method for lining a branch pipe (3) branching 
off a main pipe (1), comprising the steps of: 

(a) preparing a tubular liner bag (4) by sewing a 
rectangular nonwoven resin-absorbent fabric (5) into a 

tubular shape with one end closed and cutting it to a 
length substantially greater than the length of the 

branch pipe to be lined; (b) attaching an impermeable 
plastic film over the external surface of said tubular 

liner bag; (c) soaking said nonwoven resin-absorbent 
fabric with a hardenable fluid resin; (d) everting said 

liner bag into the branch pipe from the ground to the 
main pipe by means of a fluid pressure until the eversion 

head (4b) of the liner bag is stopped by the inner wall 
of the main pipe; (e) forcing said eversion head of the 

liner bag to turn downstream in the main pipe, thus 
allowing the liner bag to evert entirely; (f) hardening 

said hardenable fluid resin while inflating said liner 
bag by means of the fluid pressure; and (g) removing that 

portion of said liner bag which protrudes into said main 
pipe. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in 
that prior to step (d) the main pipe (1) is first lined 

with a liner (2) and that portion of the liner which 
closes the hole to the branch pipe (3) is removed. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the inner surface of said liner bag (4) before 

eversion is covered with an impermeable barrier film. 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that in step (g) the removal of said 

portion of the liner bag (4) is conducted by means of a  
 

rotary cutter (29) driven by a motor (27) and installed 
on a robot (9) which can reciprocate freely in the main 

pipe (1). 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that in step (e) a pull rope (11) with a 

hook block (12) tied halfway to it is passed in the main 
pipe (1) beforehand such that the eversion head (4b) of 

the liner bag (4) lands on the rope at a location 
downstream to the hook block, and the pull rope is pulled 

downstream so as to force the eversion head to turn. 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that in step (e) a pull rope (14) with 

an air bag (13) tied halfway to it is passed in the main 
pipe (1) beforehand such that the eversion head (4b) of 

the liner bag (4) lands on the air bag, and the pull rope 
is pulled downstream after the air bag is inflated so as 

to force the eversion head to turn. 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that in step (e) a pressurized flow of a 

fluid is applied downstream to the eversion head (4b) so 
as to force the eversion head to turn. 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that said hardenable fluid resin is a 

thermosetting resin.
