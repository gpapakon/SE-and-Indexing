<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a pressure pad (14, 14A, 
14B) for urging film (10) into contact with a magnetic 

head (12) in a camera of the type which has apparatus 
for interacting with a magnetic memory on a film (10). 

The pressure pad (14, 14A, 14B) is fabricated using a 
Santoprene® or Kraton® material as a core material 

(14A) and polyethylene as a coating material (14B). 
These materials are selected because of their 

mechanical properties and their suitability for a co-extrusion 
process. In addition, these materials have 

minimum interaction with the film (10). The coating 
material (14B) adheres effectively to the core 

material (14A) minimizing problems due to 
delamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic head 
pressure pads and is more particularly, although not 
exclusively, concerned with the use of such pressure 
pads in cameras for which the film used therewith can 
have information in the form of orientation of regions 
in a magnetic strip layer on the film. In the related art, photographic apparatus 
has been disclosed for which the film has a magnetic 
memory, typically in the form of a layer of magnetic 
material. The camera has a magnetic read/write head 
for writing information (in the form of oriented 
regions) on the film and/or for reading information 
already stored on the film into the camera. An example of a camera which can use film 
having a magnetic memory associated therewith is 
described in US-A-5 097 278. This reference discloses 
a magnetic head which makes contact with the film 
surface. A film is transported between a magnetic 
head and a pressure pad. The structure of the 
magnetic head is determined by the requirements for 
interaction with the magnetic head on the film. With respect to the pressure pad, in the 
past, a Teflon® coated rubber member has been used. 
This complexity of the structure of the pressure pad 
is a result of conflicting requirements wherein the 
pressure pad must be malleable, i.e., in order to urge 
the film against as broad an area of the magnetic head 
as possible while still permitting the film to pass 
with minimum friction between the magnetic head and 
the pressure pad. The malleable pad facilitates 
fabrication of the magnetic head by increasing the 
acceptable tolerances. A need has therefore been felt for a 
pressure pad which is malleable and relatively 
frictionless which can be inexpensively fabricated.  
 
In addition, the pressure pad must be made of a 
material which does not interact chemically with the 
film. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a pressure pad which overcomes 
the problems mentioned above. In accordance with one aspect of the 
present invention, there is provided a pressure 
pad for urging a film into contact with a member, 
said pressure pad comprising:
 
   a deformable core material; and
 
   a material layer applied on to said 
core material, said layer having a relatively low 
coefficient of friction with respect to the film, 
and being made from a material capable of being 
extruded in combination with said core material. In accordance with a second aspect of the 
present invention, there is provided a method of 
fabricating a pressure pad for use in
