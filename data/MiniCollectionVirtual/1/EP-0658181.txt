<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates generally to paints and paint bases, and, more specifically to a process for providing a stable gel-free dispersion of copper pyrithione or pyrithione disulfide plus cuprous oxide biocide in paint. The resulting paint is storage stable and remains gel-free after several months of storage at room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to paints and paint bases, and, more specifically to a process for providing a stable, gel-free dispersion of copper pyrithione and pyrithione disulfide plus cuprous oxide biocide in paint.Combinations of zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide are known to be excellent antifouling agents when formulated into paints and paint bases (i.e., the paint before pigment addition) also containing rosin, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,057,153. Unfortunately, however, such paints have now been found to thicken or gel unacceptably within a few days, at best, or a few hours, at worst, when formulated with typical commercial grades of zinc pyrithione in combination with cuprous oxide.Heretofore, various solutions to the problem of gellation of paints containing rosin and zinc pyrithione in combination with cuprous oxide, have been suggested. Illustrative solutions have been to use rigorously purified zinc pyrithione, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,098,473, or to add amines or esterified rosin, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,112,397, or to use a metal salt of rosin, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,137,569. Since these solutions may have drawbacks such as increased cost or lack of compatibility with some paints, a new, economical solution to the problem would be highly desired by the paint manufacturing community in order to maximize flexibility in using this combination of biocides in view of its excellent biocidal activity.The present invention provides one solution to this problem. This involves the use of a combination of copper pyrithione or pyrithione disulfide plus cuprous oxide as biocides in the production of a paint which is stable against gellation during storage. An antifouling paint consisting of 10 wt% of chlorinated rubber resin, 25wt% of cuprous oxide, 10wt% of copper pyrithione, 15wt% of rosin, 15wt% of red iron oxide, 4wt% of talc, 1 wt% of pulverised silica, and 20w% of xylene is known from EP 0651034A1.The invention provides a paint or paint base composition characterised by enhanced biocidal activity and gelation resistance wherein the paint or paint base contains a biocide consisting essentially of cuprous oxide and copper pyrithione or pyrithione disulfide, said copper pyrithione or pyrithione disulfide being present in an amount of between 1 % and 25% and said cuprous oxide being present in an amount of between 20% and 70%, based on the total weight of the paint or paint base, the total amount of said copper pyrithione or pyrithione disulfide plus
