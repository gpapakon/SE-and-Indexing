<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
reduction apparatus which converts a pixel density of
image data to obtain reduction image data of an
original image.A facsimile apparatus as a typical conventional
still image communication apparatus employs a method of
sequentially scanning, encoding, and transmitting an
image. In this method, since all the data of an image
must be transmitted to recognize an entire image, a
long transmission time is required, and it is difficult
to apply this method to image communication services
such as an image database service, a videotex, and the
like, in which an image must be quickly judged. In
order to realize these services, unlike in the method
employed in the facsimile apparatus, hierarchical
encoding methods such as a sequential reproduction
encoding method ("Sequential Reproduction Encoding
Method of Facsimile Signal Suitable for Conversational
Image Communications", Endo, Yamasaki, et al.,
Shingakuron (B), J67-B. 12, pp. 1462 - 1469 (1984)) are
proposed. In the sequential reproduction encoding 
method, rough image information is transmitted, and
thereafter, additional information is transmitted to
generate detailed image data. We also proposed similar
encoding methods in USP Serial Nos. 398,665, (filed on
Aug. 25, 1989), 400,103 (filed on Aug. 29, 1989),
401,240 (filed on Aug. 31, 1989), 438,082 (filed on
Nov. 20, 1989), 446,791 (filed on Dec. 6, 1989), and
458,362 (filed on Dec. 28, 1989).Fig. 1A shows a conventional hierarchical encoding
system.The system shown in Fig. 1A includes frame
memories 701 to 704 for respectively storing a 1/1
image, and 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 reduction images,
reduction units 705 to 707 for generating 1/2, 1/4, and
1/8 reduction images, respectively, and encoders 708 to
711 for encoding 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and 1/1 images,
respectively.The reduction unit 705 reduces an image from the
frame memory 701 in both main and sub scanning
directions by subsampling, or the like to generate a
1/2 image, and stores the 1/2 image in the frame memory
702. Furthermore, the reduction unit 706 reduces the
1/2 image to form a 1/4 image, and stores the 1/4 image
in the frame memory 703. Similarly, the reduction unit
707 generates a 1/8 low-resolution image, and stores it
in the frame memory 704.Since images are sequentially encoded and 
transmitted from those having a lower resolution, a
rough entire image can be quickly recognized. In the
system shown in Fig. 1A, an image is reduced to 1/2,
1/4, or 1/8 in both the main and sub scanning
directions. Encoding is

<CLAIMS>
An image reduction apparatus comprising:

input means (900) for inputting pixel data
representing an image to be reduced,
cut out means (901) for generating from the input
pixels blocks each containing a predetermined number of

pixels; and
reduction means (902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907) for
outputting for each block a set of pixels representing a reduced signal wherein a set of pixels comprises less pixels than the corresponding block, and

characterised that said reducing means include means
(903) for filtering input blocks of pixel data with a

predetermined coefficient to generate an output,
means (902) for comparing each block with a
plurality of predetermined patterns, the patterns

representing either black images on a white background
or white images on a black background, and if a block

corresponds to one of the predetermined patterns, to
replace the output of the filter means representing that

pattern with a set of pixels different from that which would have
been generated by the filter means so as to maintain in

the reduced image features which would have been lost by
filtering with said predetermined coefficient, and

wherein the number of predetermined patterns representing
black images on a white background is greater than the

number of predetermined patterns of white images on a
black background.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
reduction means is adapted when a block corresponds to

one of said predetermined patterns which represents a
black image on a white background and the output of the

filter means in response to the block represents a white
pixel to replace the white pixel with a black pixel.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said
reduction means is adapted when a block corresponds to

one of said predetermined patterns which represents a
white image on a black background and the output of the

filter in response to the block represents a black pixel
to replace the black pixel with a white pixel.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim and

output of said filter means.
An image reduction method comprising:

inputting pixel data representing an image to be
reduced,
generating from the input pixels blocks each
containing a predetermined number of pixels; and
a reduction step of outputting for each block a set of pixels representing
a reduced image wherein a set of pixels comprises less pixels than the corresponding block, said reduction step including

filtering successive input blocks of pixel data with a
predetermined coefficient to generate a filtered output, 
comparing each block with a plurality of
predetermined patterns, the patterns representing either

black images on a white background or white images on a
black background, and if a block corresponds to one of

the predetermined patterns, replacing said filtered
output with a set of pixels different from that which would have

been generated by the filtering so as to maintain in the
