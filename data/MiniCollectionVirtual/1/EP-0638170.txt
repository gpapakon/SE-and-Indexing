<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for rapidly extracting ciguatoxin
from serum or other samples containing ciguatoxin.Ciguatera poisoning is a particular type of fish poisoning which results from
the ingestion of contaminated fish. Intoxication is associated with the consumption
of toxins produced by tropical dino- flagellates, including Gambierdiscustoxicus,
which are subsequently passed along the food chain to man. Ciguatoxins are
polyether marine toxins, and approximately 27 different ciguatoxins are known,
approximately 23 of which are toxic to man. Ciguatera toxins are odorless,
tasteless, heat-stable, and generally undetectable by simple chemical tests.Humans are susceptible to ciguatera poisoning, both from eating toxic
herbivores which ingest the dino-flagellates while feeding on red or brown algae,
and from eating carnivores which have eaten the toxic herbivores. An accurate
assessment of the incidence of ciguatera poisoning is not available; however, it is
estimated that, each year, from 10,000 to 50,000 people who live in or visit tropical
and subtropical areas suffer from ciguatera poisoning. Additionally, the threat of
this contamination results in enormous economic losses in the recreational and
commercial exploitation of fishery resources in the affected areas.Ciguatera poisoning is considered a world health problem. The illness is
prevalent in the tropical Caribbean and subtropical North Atlantic, as well as the
Pacific regions. Although, in the past, toxic outbreaks were limited to the endemic
areas, interregional transport of fish can result in outbreaks in nontropical parts of
the world. Ciguatera poisoning outbreaks have been documented in Canada, Egypt, Sri
Lanka, Italy, Japan, Venezuela, French Polynesia, French Antilles, and Australia.
In the United States, cases have been reported in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Kansas,
Hawaii, Samoa, the Virgin Islands, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, New York,
Tennessee, and Washington, D.C. A few cases of ciguatera poisoning were
reported in Vermont after several restaurants served toxic barracuda imported from
tropical regions.The onset of the clinical symptoms of ciguatera poisoning occurs within 10
minutes to 24 hours following the consumption of contaminated fish. Ciguatera
poisoning affects the digestive system (resulting in abdominal pain, diarrhea,
vomiting, nausea); the cardiovascular system (resulting in bradycardia, hypotension,
tachycardia); and the neurological system (resulting primarily in paresthesia and
dysesthesia).The

<CLAIMS>
A method of rapidly extracting ciguatoxins from
tissue comprising:


mixing a tissue sample with a first solvent to
solubilize and extract ciguatoxin from the sample;
adding a second solvent which is not soluble in the
first solvent and which extracts contaminants, but not

ciguatoxin, from the first solvent;
separating the phases formed by the first and second
solvents;
collecting the first solvent phase;
evaporating the first solvent, of the first solvent
phase, to dryness to produce a residue;
resuspending the residue in a third solvent;
adding a fourth solvent which is not soluble in the
third solvent and which extracts contaminants, but not

ciguatoxin, from the third solvent;
separating the phases formed by the third and fourth
solvents; and
collecting the third solvent phase.
A method as recited in claim 1 wherein the first
solvent comprises chloroform.
A method as recited in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
second solvent comprises methanol.
A method as recited in claim 3 wherein the second
solvent further comprises water.
A method as recited in any preceding claim, wherein
the third solvent comprises methanol.
A method as recited in claim 5 wherein the third
solvent further comprises acetonitrile. 
A method as recited in any preceding claim, wherein
the third solvent comprises 70% v/v methanol and 30% v/v

acetonitrile.
A method as recited in any preceding claim, wherein
the fourth solvent comprises hexane.
