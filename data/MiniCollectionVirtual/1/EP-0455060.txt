capsules (2) on a metering machine comprising a rotary 

body (6) supporting a container (7) housing the product. 
The device (3) comprises:

 
a block (17) inside which is formed a sealed chamber 

(21);
 

a pin (18) having a head (33) housed in mobile manner 
inside the chamber (21); and a portion (35) designed, 

through a hole (8) formed in the bottom (11) of the container 
(7), to compact the product inside the capsule 

(2) underneath the hole (8);

a source (26) and the chamber (21), for exerting pressure 

on the head (33), and such that the extent to which 
the product is compacted depends on the pressure of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device, installed on 
a metering machine, for compacting pharmaceutical products, 
preferably powders, inside preferably hard gelatine 
capsules. Known metering machines feature a rotary annular container, 
the bottom of which presents a number of holes 
which, for each turn of the container, are opened at the 
bottom for a given period of time. Beneath the container, 
a conveyor belt supports a number of bottom capsule 
portions which, for said period, are arranged coaxial 
with said holes. The machine also comprises a rotary 
drum fitted with a number of rods moved axially by a cam 
and each fitted on the end with a block from which a pin 
extends inwards of the container. The compacting function 
is performed by said pin, which presses the powder 
inside the capsule once or several times for each turn 
of the machine. The pressure exerted by the pin is counteracted 
by a spring, the setting of which determines 
how much pressure is applied.  The above compacting system presents several drawbacks. 
Foremost of these is that, for ensuring the powder is 
compacted equally in all the capsules, the springs must 
be set one by one to the same value. Achieving an accurate 
setting is a painstaking job even in the case of 
one spring, let alone for several. What is more, the 
setting of the spring is what determines the extent to 
which the powder is compacted and, therefore, the amount 
of powder fed into the capsule. Consequently, any inaccuracy 
in the setting of the spring results in a corresponding 
inaccuracy in the amount of powder fed into the 
capsule. Last but not least is the fact that the springs 
cannot be set without first stopping the machine. It is an object of the present invention is provide a 
metering machine device for compacting pharmaceutical 
products in capsules, designed to overcome the aforementioned 
drawbacks, i.e. which can be set easily and accurately 
without having to stop the machine. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
device for compacting pharmaceutical products in capsules 
on a metering machine comprising a first drum type 
body designed to rotate a container filled with said 
product, characterised by the fact that it comprises: 
at least a second body above said container and in which 
is formed a first airtight chamber;
 
a vertical axially-mobile pin supported on said second 
body and having a top portion housed in said first chamber, 
and a bottom portion outside said second body and  
 
designed, in at least

<CLAIMS>
A device for compacting pharmaceutical products in 
capsules on a metering machine comprising a first drum 

type body (6) designed to rotate a container (7) filled 
with said product, characterised by the fact that it 

comprises: 
at least a second body (17) above said container (7) and 

in which is formed a first airtight chamber (21); 
a vertical axially-mobile pin (18) supported on said 

second body (17) and having a top portion (33) housed in 
said first chamber (21), and a bottom portion (35) outside 

said second body (17) and designed, in at least one 
operating stage, to engage a first hole (8) formed in 

the bottom (11) of said container (7), for compacting 
said product in a capsule (2) underneath said first hole 

(8); 
a pressurized fluid circuit (55, 54, 58, 22, 24) between 

a source (26) of said fluid and said first chamber (21), 
for exerting downward pressure on said top portion (33) 

of said pin (18), and such that the extent to which said 
product is compacted is a function of the pressure of 

said fluid inside said first chamber (21); and 
a vertical piston (16) supporting said second body (17) 

and designed to move back and forth along a second vertical 
hole (15) formed in said first body (6). 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised by 
the fact that said circuit (55) presents a pressure regulator 

(56) operated by a manual or electrical control. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterised by the fact that said second body (17)
