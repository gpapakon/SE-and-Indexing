<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heat curable foundry 
mixes, heat curable resin binder compositions, and 
latent acid catalyst compositions particularly suitable 
for making foundry shapes by a hot box process. More 
particularly, the invention relates to bench life 
extended, heat curable, hot box foundry mixes. The hot box process is a high production method of 
producing cores and molds, used for casting metal 
pieces in foundry applications. The process involves 
the mixing of a latent acid catalyst, and a liquid 
thermosetting binder resin (e.g., a phenolic resole), 
with a quantity of foundry sand. The wetted sand mix 
is then blown into a heated pattern. The heat causes a 
curing mechanism to take place and a solid sand core or 
mold is obtained. Typically, the catalyst/resin/sand mixture will 
become hard or gummy (non-flowable) when allowed to 
stand under ambient conditions for an extended period 
of time. The bench life of a sand mixture at ambient 
temperature can be defined as the time it takes for the 
mixture to become non-workable. Or put another way, 
the bench life can be defined as the maximum 
permissible time delay between mixing the binder 
components together with sand, and the production of 
acceptable products from the mixture. In most cases, a 
bench life of a few hours is sufficient. However, in  
 
some instances, a bench life greater than eight hours 
is required. For example, when the mixture is used to 
make molds and cores, a sand mixture may be required to 
remain unused in a storage hopper overnight. It is 
important that the sand mix not harden during this 
period because clean up would require additional 
effort, entail downtime, generate waste, and would mean 
a loss of efficiency. A means of extending the bench 
life of a hot box sand mixture to at least 24 hours 
would minimize these negative effects. Current state of the art bench life additives, such 
as ammonia, have limited use as extender materials. 
Furthermore, ammonia has an associated odor problem. 
The use of effective carbonate materials such as 
calcium carbonate as bench life additives has the 
disadvantage of insolubility in either or both of the 
catalyst and the resin. Thus, an extra addition system 
is required when using these materials. Furthermore, 
carbonate materials can have a negative effect on the 
tensile strengths of the cores produced. We have now found that the use of an alkali metal 
salt of a polybasic acid as an additive to a hot box 
sand mixture can extend the bench life of the coated 
sa
