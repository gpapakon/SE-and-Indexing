<ABSTRACT>
The inability of organosiloxane compositions 
containing an organohydrogensiloxane as the curing agent and 

a platinum group metal-containing catalyst to cure 
completely on substrates containing residues of solder 

fluxes or other cure-inhibiting materials is remedied by 
coating at least that portion of the substrate containing 

the residue with a layer of an organosilicon compound 
containing at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per 

molecule prior to application of the curable organosiloxane 
composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for curing
organosiloxane compositions by a platinum group metal
catalyzed hydrosilation reaction in the presence of cure-inhibiting
impurities such as carboxylic acids. Our method
is particularly useful for curing gels used as protective
coatings for electronic components in the presence of "no-clean"
solder fluxes containing carboxylic acids.Organosiloxane materials, elastomers, resins and
gels exhibit a number of physical, chemical and electrical
properties that make them desirable for use as coatings,
encapsulants and potting materials for electronic and
electrical components.In typical applications, curable organosiloxane
compositions are applied to substrates such as printed
circuit boards to which electronic components, such as
transistors, integrated circuits and other solid state
devices, have been attached by soldering. The
organosiloxane composition is then cured by conventional
procedures. In many applications, gels are more desirable
than elastomeric or resinous materials based on their low
modulus which allows these materials to expand in response
to stresses resulting from heat-induced expansion of
electronic components. If not relieved, these stresses are
often sufficient to cause breakage of delicate wire bonds
and other parts, resulting in malfunction of the component.Organosiloxane compositions that cure by a
hydrosilation reaction are preferred for protection of
electrical and electronic circuits because they cure at
relatively low temperatures and do not generate by-products
during curing. The curing reaction involves alkenyl
radicals such as vinyl and silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms. One disadvantage of these compositions is the
ability of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms to react with water
and organic compounds containing hydroxyl groups. These
reactions reduce the number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms
available to cure the organosiloxane composition. In
particular, it has been difficult to completely cure
organosiloxane compositions using a hydrosilation reaction
or the reaction between silicon bonded hydrogen atoms and
silanol (=SiOH) groups in the presence of organic compounds
such as alcohols and carboxylic acids.A recent trend in the electronics industry has
been to eliminate the organic solvents formerly used to
remove fluxes that facilitate soldering of components to
printed circuit boards. These fluxes contain relative large
amounts of carboxylic acids. We have found that the acids
present in the flux react with a portion of the

A method for curing an organosiloxane
composition containing an organohydrogensiloxane as the

curing agent when said composition is in contact with a
substrate having on its surface a solder flux comprising at

least one cure-inhibiting component, said method comprising
the sequential steps of


1) applying a layer of an organosilicon compound
which is liquid at 25°C and contains at least two silicon-bonded

hydrogen atoms per molecule to at least those
portions of said substrate containing said cure-inhibiting

component,
2) applying a curable organosiloxane composition
over said layer of liquid organosilicon compound, the

composition comprising

A) a polyorganosiloxane containing an average of
at least two alkenyl radicals or silanol groups per molecule

and exhibiting a viscosity greater than 0.1 Pa·s;
B) an amount of a liquid organohydrogensiloxane
sufficient to cure said composition, where said organohydrogensiloxane

contains an average of at least two
silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule, with the proviso

that the sum of the average number of alkenyl radicals or
silanol groups per molecule present in said

polyorganosiloxane and the average number of silicon-bonded
hydrogen atoms per molecule in said organohydrogensiloxane

is greater than 4 and the molar ratio of silicon-bonded
hydrogen atom in said organohydrogensiloxane to alkenyl

radicals or silanol groups in said polyorganosiloxane is
from 0.3 to 20; and

platinum group metal concentration of from 0.1 to 500 parts

by weight of platinum group metal, or a compound of said
metal, per one million parts by weight of the combined

weight of A and B to promote curing of said composition; and
