<ABSTRACT>
The system exploits the characteristics of the 
behaviour of laser light in fog, and makes use of laser 

sources (41, 43) of coherent light and fibre optic 
distribution from each of the said sources to a plurality 

of signalling light points (41V; 43V, 43B) with the 
emission of directed light beams with controlled divergence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a road signalling system 
characterized in that it exploits particular properties 
of the collimated beams of photons characteristic of 
laser sources, which are much more penetrating than 
conventional diffused light, especially in conditions of 
poor visibility due to the presence of fog. Various and 
substantial advantages are obtained with this. In the presence of fog, in other words water 
particles suspended in the air, normal light tends to be 
diffused, creating what is known as a "wall effect". By 
comparison with this, laser light, since it consists of 
collimated beams of photons, is much more directional, 
and therefore has a greater range through fog. With laser 
light it is possible to concentrate large quantities of 
light exactly at frequencies to which the eye is most 
sensitive, with a minimum energy consumption. The eye is 
approximately thirty times more sensitive to laser light 
than to diffused light, in night vision conditions, and 
approximately one hundred and fifty times more sensitive 
in daytime vision, for the same emitted energy. Owing to the phenomenon of "physiological 
nystagmus", diffused light produces in the eye an impulse 
to scan the contours of the light halo; this does not 
occur with laser light, which appears to the eye as a 
clearly circumscribed and defined image, thus increasing 
the powers of perception of the human eye. The object of the invention is therefore a 
motorway signalling system - capable of operating in fog 
- which is based on the use of a laser source of coherent 
light and on fibre optic distribution from the said 
source to a plurality of signal light points. The signal light points are for the most part 
distributed along a route to be signalled, and at least 
one optical fibre runs to each of them.  The system comprises a multiple connector between 
the laser source and a bundle of fibres, and branches of 
single fibres from the said bundle with corresponding 
terminals for connection to supports for light points. In a practical embodiment, a connecting terminal 
forming a light point comprises an optical system to 
create a desired aperture of the light energy beam 
emitted and protective means, such as a protective shell 
which is generally cylindrical. A light point support may advantageously be a 
supporting member extending vertically, combined with 
means of articulation in at least two orthogonal axes, 
for angular orientation. The said support may be a pole 
with a telescopic upper part whose position is
