<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for coating a support plate comprising at least partially transparent plastic material, in particular polymethyl methacrylates, in which a surface layer of a scratch-resistant, preferably inorganic material, such as SiO2 or the like, which is essentially harder than the plastic material of the support plate is applied to at least one surface of the support plate, characterised in that the surface layer is first applied to a plastic film and then the prelaminate comprising the plastic film and the surface layer is bonded to the support plate, and the invention relates in particular to a support plate produced by this process.
