<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel metallic oxide and
to a process for manufacturing such a metallic oxide, and more
particularly, to a boron-containing metallic oxide and to a
process for manufacturing such a metallic oxide. Also, the
invention can be used in a superconducting material and is also
applicable to various fields, such as sensors, electronic devices,
computers, medical instruments, magnets, transmission lines,
energy equipment, voltage standard, and the like. Further, the
metallic oxide of the present invention is particularly effective
in the form of a wire and a thick film and is also applicable when
it is bonded with or dispersed in other oxides or metals.Copper-containing metallic oxide superconducting materials
have been discovered one after another in recent years. Such
materials have much higher superconducting critical temperatures
(Tc) than those of conventionally-known niobium-type materials.
Because of this advantage, various research has been being made to
apply such materials in many fields.Among these copper-containing metallic oxide superconducting 
materials, the following types are particularly known: YBa2Cu3Oy
referred to as the Y type, Bi2Sr2CanCu1+nOy (n=0,1,2,) referred to
as the Bi type, Tl2Ba2CanCu1+nOy (n=0,1,2) referred to as the Tl
type, and the like. Research is currently in progress to put
these types of materials to practical use.Also, in particular, as a boron (B)-containing metallic oxide
superconducting material, Physica C, Vol.205 (1993), p.118-122
introduces a material having a composition of YSr0.8Ba1.2Cu2.5B0.5O7
and a superconducting critical temperature Tc of 51K.Among the above-noted metallic oxide superconducting
materials, the Y-type and Tl-type materials present the following
problem when applied to superconducting wires or magnetic shield
thick films. The crystal grains in the grain boundary tend to
bond weakly with each other, that is, they suffer from, what is
called, "a weak link", thereby resulting in a failure to increase
the critical current density. Such a conventional problem is
disclosed in SCIENCE Vol.259 (1993) p.306-308 and INDUSTRIAL
MATERIAL Vol.41 (1993.3) p.18-25, and the like.Further, among the foregoing metallic oxide superconducting
materials, when the Bi type is applied to a wire or a thick film,
unlike the Y type and Tl type, the crystal grains in the grain
boundary are unlikely to suffer from a weak link, thus exerting
outstanding two-dimensional crystalline characteristics, thereby
enhancing the easy application of the
