<CLAIMS>
Device for fastening insulation plates (12) to an anchoring substrate (9),
comprising an insulation holder (1) having a shank (2) and a holding disk (3) and a

screw (4) that is inserted securely by a portion of its length in a portion of the shank (2)
that faces the anchoring substrate, the holding disk (3) of the insulation holder (1) having

an opening (5, 5a) suitable for transferring torque, 
characterized in that
 the device also
comprises an expansible plug (10) that can be inserted into the anchoring substrate (9)

and that has an extension (14) that engages in the insulation plate (12), the internal
diameter of which extension corresponds to the external diameter of the portion of the

shank (2) of the insulation holder (1) that faces the anchoring substrate, and the shank

(2) is surrounded by the extension (14) as the screw (4) is screwed into the expansible
plug (10).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the external diameter of the
expansible plug (10) is less than the external diameter of the extension (14).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the shank (2) of the insulation
holder (1) has a thickened portion (11) in the region of the opening (5, 5a), the end face

of which thickened portion that faces the leading end is in the form of an oblique
face (13).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the opening (5) is of oval
cross-section.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the opening (5a) is of
polygonal shape.
