<ABSTRACT>
Immunocompromised or immunosuppressed non-primate chimeric mammalian hosts comprising a neuronal graft in the eye are provided for studying various events associated with humans. Particularly, the chimeric host may have solely human fetal neuronal xenografts or other fetal xenografts with other tissue, where the various tissues may be studied as to their response to a variety of agents, their response to pathogens or other diseased states, or their response to agents for the treatment of the various indications.

 INFECTION OF HUMAN NEURAL XENOGRAFTSINTRODUCTION Cross-Reference to Government GrantsResearch in support of the subject invention was supported to PHS Grants NS28754, EY09217 and AI32315. The United States Government may have rights in this invention.Cross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of application serial no. 07/786,449, filed November 1, 1991.Technical FieldThe field of this invention is the use of human neural human xenografts in the eye of an immunocompromiÎµed host for studying the effect of various agents on human neural tissue.BackgroundIn the attempts to understand human disease and develop therapies, the medical and associated fields have frequently relied upon analogies to observations in animals. While there are a number of similarities between non-primates and primates, there are also a large number of differences. Many of the naturally-produced agents, such as cytokines, hormones, surface membrane proteins, blood proteins, and the like, differ significantly in 

 their composition. Most importantly, for the transduction of signals, cellular interactions, regeneration and differentiation, the molecules involved frequently have a narrow range of host specificity. Where autocrine or paracrine mechanisms are not involved, xenogeneic tissue introduced into a non-primate host must totally rely upon the host for the source of ligands not produced by the xenogeneic tissue or other xenogeneic tissue must be supplied which makes such ligands available. Furthermore, xenogeneic tissue is subject to rejection by an im unocompetent host, so that means must be provided to protect the xenogeneic tissue from degeneration as a result of immune rejection. There are no viable hosts which have no protective mechanisms against foreign entities.There has been substantial interest in using immunosuppressive agents or immunocompromised hosts to extend the period in which xenogeneic explants may be maintained as viable functional tissue. Frequently, in order to be useful to study the effect of the agents on the xenogeneic tissue, the tissue must retain most if not substantially all of its natural characteristics. However, since the xenogeneic tissue, at best, is only a very small amount of tissue compared to the entire host, it can be subject to many modifications which may change its characteristics, so as to substantially reduce its predictive capability as to the response of the xenogeneic host. 

 Where the xenogeneic tissue has mobile cells, such as host organs of
