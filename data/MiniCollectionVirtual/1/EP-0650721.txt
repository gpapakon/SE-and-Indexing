<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a microemulsion concentrate 
containing cyclosporin as an active ingredient, dimethylisosorbide 

as a cosurfactant, oil and a surfactant which is suitable 
for the formulation of a soft capsule for oral administration. 

In the microemulsion concentrate according to the present invention, 
cyclosporin, dimethyl isosorbide, oil and surfactant are 

present in the ratio of 1:1-5:1-5:2-10, and preferably in the 
ratio of 1:2-4:2-5:2-7, by weight. Since dimethylisosorbide has 

substantially no membrane permeation property, the soft capsule 
preparation according to the present invention is outstandingly 

stable in comparison with the soft capsules containing ethanol, 
propylene glycol, transcutol, glycofurol, etc., as a cosurfactant 

in the prior art, and further provides an advantage in that the 
pharmaceutical effect, appearance and composition content of the 

soft capsule according to the present invention are not changed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soft capsule composition
containing a stable microemulsion concentrate suitable for the
preparation of cyclosporin-containing soft capsules. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a microemulsion
concentrate containing cyclosporin as an active ingredient,
dimethylisosorbide as a co-surfactant, an oil component and a
surfactant, which is suitable for formulation into soft capsules
and to a soft capsule composition containing said microemulsion
concentrate.Cyclosporin is a specific macromolecular (molecular weight
1202.64) cyclic peptide compound consisting of 11 amino acids,
which has useful pharmacological activities, particularly immunosuppressive
activity and anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore,
cyclosporin has been used for suppression of immunological
responses native to the living body, which are caused by tissue
and organ transplantation, for example, transplantation of the
heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, bone marrow, skin and
cornea, and particularly the transplantation of foreign tissues
and organs. In addition, cyclosporin is useful for the suppression
of autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases such as 
arthritis, etc.Cyclosporin is highly lipophilic and hydrophobic with a
solubility in water at 25oC being 16 to 23mg of cyclosporin per
liter of water. The bioavailability of cyclosporin is also
extremely low due to its low water-solubility. On the other
hand, cyclosporin is well dissolved in an organic solvent such as
methanol, ethanol, acetone, ether, chloroform and the like, due
to its high lipophilic property.As with other conventional drugs which are sparingly soluble
in water, cyclosporin is very difficult to formulate into a
preparation for oral administration due to its low water solubility
and bioavailability. Further, since the bioavailability of
cyclosporin may be greately influenced by the condition of each
individual patient, it is very difficult to provide an effective
therapeutic effect.Moreover, it is very important to provide a uniform dosage
amount and appropriate bioavailability since counterbalancing the
efficacy of cyclosporin are its considerable toxic side effects
such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, among others. Accordingly,
numerous studies have been extensively and widely conducted
to find a preparation suitable for the effective oral administration
of cyclosporin.The prior art preparations suitable for oral administration
of sparingly water-soluble cyclosporin are usually formulated in 
the form of a
