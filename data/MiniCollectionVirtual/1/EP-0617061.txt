<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer capable of 
exhibiting water and oil repellency and an antifouling 
agent comprising it as an effective component. In recent years, it has been common to apply water 
and oil repellent treatment or antifouling treatment to 
clothings, and various compositions have been proposed 
depending upon the particular purposes. For example, in 
the cases of working clothes, rental sheets, etc., 
fluorine-type SR (soil release) treating agents are 
commonly employed which provide water and oil repellency 
for antifouling performance and a SR (soil release) 
property whereby any soil attached may readily be removed 
by e.g. washing. Such treatments are required to be 
highly durable against washing and dry cleaning, and 
various methods have been proposed to obtain such 
durability. As such treating agents, there have been proposed a 
copolymer of a polyfluoroalkyl group-containing acrylate-acrylonitrile-a  
 
copolymerizable hydrophilic group-containing 
(meth)acrylate (Japanese Examined Patent 
Publication No. 18192/1978), a polyfluoroalkyl group-containing 
polymer having glycidyl methacrylate 
copolymerized as a crosslinking component (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 68006/1992), and a 
combination at the time of treatment of a polyfluoroalkyl 
group-containing polymer and a compound having a blocked 
isocyanate group. However, these treating agents still 
have problems such that no adequate durability has yet 
been obtained, or if satisfactory durability can be 
obtained, the cloth is likely to undergo yellowing or its 
texture tends to be hard. Thus, there has been no 
treating agent which is fully satisfactory. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
treating agent anew which is capable of providing high 
durability and which is free from a problem such as 
yellowing. The present invention has been made to solve the 
above problems and provides a polymer comprising 
polymeric units derived from an acrylate or methacrylate 
containing a polyfluoroalkyl group, polymeric units 
derived from an acrylate or methacrylate containing a 
blocked isocyanate group, and polymeric units derived 
from an acrylate or methacrylate containing a 
polyoxyalkylene chain. The present invention also provides an antifouling  
 
agent comprising such a polymer as an effective 
component. The fluorine-type polymer of the present invention is 
a polymer which is capable of imparting water and oil 
repellency as well as an antifouling property and thus is 
useful as
