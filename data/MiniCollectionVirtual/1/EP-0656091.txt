<ABSTRACT>
The retractable conduit of the invention comprises a sheet of memory-set polyester (4) formed as a conduit. To manufacture the memory-set strip, the polyester sheet (4) is wound into the desired retracted, e.g. coiled, position, heated and cooled. After this process the sheet of polyester will automatically assume the retracted position. In one embodiment, suitable as a splashblock, the distal end (47) of the polyester sheet (46) is wider than the end (48) attachable to a downspout (49). In another embodiment the polyester sheet (4) is sheathed in an elongated polyethylene tube (2), to form a retractable hose. In a preferred embodiment, the distal end of the hose is supported on a spool (14) which will roll along the ground as the hose is wound and unwound to further ensure that the hose retracts properly. The tube can also be provided with holes (18) to act as a sprinkler if desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates, generally, to conduits, 
e.g. splashblocks and hoses and, more particularly, to an 
automatically retracting splashblock or hose suitable for 
use as an extension on a down spout, a sprinkler hose, a 
pump hose and the like. One such retractable hose consists of a plastic or 
rubber tube having two steel wires imbedded therein where 
the steel wires are formed so as to have a coiled shape. 
The steel wires wind the tube so that it will normally be 
in a coiled or rolled configuration. When water is forced 
through the tube under pressure, the tube is unwound and 
the water is conveyed through the tube to a remote 
location. When the water pressure is removed, the metal 
springs automatically return the tube to the rolled 
position. The tube also can be provided with holes along 
its length to allow it to function as a sprinkler. Hoses 
with such coiled steel wire are disclosed in US-A-3 035 
779 and 3 966 121. The former mentions that the tube 
might be of plastic or rubber cured in the coiled form. US-A-3035779 discloses a self-retracting 
downspout discharge extension in which a self coiling 
characteristic may be imparted by a spring metal strip 
or wire and also by coiling the hose before its plastic 
or rubber is cured and curing it in the coiled form. US-A-2 814 529 also discloses a retractable hose 
that uses a flat spring steel band, a strip of resilient 
material such as plastic or rubber or a helical spring to 
provide the retracting force. The rubber or plastic tube 
of this patent is provided with holes and is intended to 
be used as a sprinkler. US-A-4 582 257 discloses a perforated dual-tube 
retractable hose which uses flat longitudinal strips of 
vinyl plastic, e.g. styrene, as a spring mechanism. 
Styrene strips are inserted into two adjacently-joined 
tubes. The hose is then wound tightly on a core and 
strapped to prevent unwinding. The hose is then boiled in 
water to set the styrene into a "clock spring"  
  
 
configuration. US-A-3 826 288 shows a hose for a high-pressure 
air supply which returns to a figure-of-eight conformation 
by virtue of the use of the "elastic memory" of e.g. 
nylon. A major problem associated with all of the above-mentioned 
types of retractable hoses is that over time 
the springs will lose their "memory" such that the hose 
is not rewound to its proper position. The problem is 
compounded in prior art devices which use two springs 
because the force applied by each spring will differ as 
the springs lose their "memory", unless the

A retractable conduit which comprises a memory-set, 
elongate sheet (4,20,28,38,46) of crystalline or 

semi-crystalline thermoplastic polyester, said sheet 
having two ends, one of said ends being attachable to the 

exterior of a spout (8,44,62) through which fluid may 
flow, said sheet being shaped and memory-set in such 

shape that said sheet is able to move from a lay-flat 
compact form to an elongated form when a force is applied 

thereto and to retract to said compact form when said 
force is removed, the fluid exerting said force when 

flowing along said sheet towards the other of the ends. 
A retractable conduit according to claim 1 
wherein the memory-set elongated sheet is spirally coiled 

in its compact form.

(12), said elongate sheet extending for substantially the 
length of the tube, and wherein there is a means for 

connecting the inlet end (6) of said tube to a spout (8) 
for fluid, the fluid exerting said force when flowing in
