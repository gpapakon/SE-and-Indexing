<ABSTRACT>
An opening roof comprises a frame (20, 22) 
bounding a roof opening (14) in a vehicle roof (16) and 

having a flange (26) which is supported on the top surface 
of the vehicle roof (16) surrounding at least part of the 

opening (14). A resilient seal (32) is clamped between the 
flange (26) of the frame (20, 22) and the top surface of 

the vehicle roof (16) and extends outwardly beyond the 
frame (20, 22) so as to be engageable by the edge (44) of 

a cover (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an opening roof of the 
type comprising a frame member bounding a roof opening in 
a vehicle roof and having a flange which is supported on 
the top surface of the vehicle roof surrounding at least 
part of the opening, together with a cover for covering the 
roof opening which, in its closed position, extends over 
the edge of the roof opening on at least one side thereof. GB-A-945576 discloses an opening roof of this type 
in which the cover comprises a flexible fabric cover which 
is secured to the rear edge of the roof opening and, in its 
closed position, extends over the edge of the roof opening 
on its front and two lateral sides. EP-A-0098063 discloses 
an opening roof of the type described above in which the 
cover is a rigid panel which is pivotally attached to the 
front edge of the opening. As described, the panel 
projects only over the frame, but it could be extended so 
as to project over the vehicle roof. The present invention is applicable both to 
opening roofs having rigid covers and to opening roofs 
having folding covers. According to the invention, in an opening roof of 
the type described above, a resilient seal member is 
clamped between the flange of the frame and the top surface 
of the vehicle roof and extends outwardly beyond the frame 
on said at least one side to form a seal for engagement by 
the cover when in its closed position. Preferably, the seal member includes a peripheral 
upwardly extending projection located outside the edge of 
the cover when the latter is in its closed position. When 
said one side is the front edge of the roof opening, this 
upwardly extending projection may be configured to serve as 
a wind deflector. When said one side is the rear edge of 
the roof opening, this upwardly extending projection may be 
configured to serve as a spoiler. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:  Figure 1 is a perspective view of the upper part 
of a car body fitted with an opening roof in accordance 
with the invention; Figure 2 is a sectional view on the line 2 - 2 in 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a sectional view on the line 3 - 3 in 
Figure 1; Figure 4 is a plan view of one corner of the frame 
of the opening roof shown in Figures 1 to 3, with the cover 
in its open position; and Figure 5 is a sectional view on the line 5 - 5 in 
Figures 1 and 4. Referring to Figure 1, a motor car 10 has an 
opening roof comprising a folding fabric cover 12 having 
its

<CLAIMS>
An opening roof comprising a frame (20, 22) 
bounding a roof opening (14) in a vehicle roof (16) and 

having a flange (26) which is supported on the top surface 
of the vehicle roof (16) surrounding at least part of the 

opening (14), together with a cover (12) for covering the 
roof opening (14) which, in its closed position, extends 

over the edge of the roof opening (14) on at least one side 
thereof, characterised in that a resilient seal member (32) 

is clamped between the flange (26) of the frame (20, 22) 
and the top surface of the vehicle roof (16) and extends 

outwardly beyond the frame (20, 22) on said at least one 
side to form a seal for engagement by the cover (12) when 

in its closed position. 
An opening roof according to claim 1, wherein the 
surface of the seal member (32) abutting the frame (20, 22) 

has a formation 34 shaped to engage with a complementary 
formation (36) on the frame (20, 22). 
An opening roof according to claim 1, wherein the 
seal member (32) includes a peripheral upwardly extending 

projection (40) located outside the edge of the cover (12) 
when the latter is in its closed position. 
An opening roof according to claim 3, wherein said 
one side is the front edge of the roof opening (14), and 

the peripheral projection (40) is configured to serve as a 
wind deflector. 
An opening roof according to claim 3, wherein said 
one side is the rear edge of the roof opening (14), and the 

peripheral projection (40) is configured to serve as a 
spoiler. 
An opening roof according to claim 3, 4 or 5, 
wherein the seal member (32) includes an intermediate 

upwardly extending projection (38) located adjacent to the 
outside edge of the frame (20, 22) and, together with the 

peripheral projection (40), forming a rainwater channel 
(42) on the upper surface of the seal member (32). 
An opening roof according to claim 6, further 
 

comprising a drain hole (52) extending from the rainwater 
channel (42) under the outer projection (40).
