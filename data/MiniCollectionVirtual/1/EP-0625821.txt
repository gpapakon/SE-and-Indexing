<ABSTRACT>
The hysteresis of a two-point regulator is normally fixed such that the current fluctuations linked to it are, as a percentage, in the order of magnitude of 10-20% of the rated current. This is problematic in the case of drives which operate over a wide rotation speed range. Thus, small currents, for example a current of 5% of the rated current, cannot be set without the current regulator having a discontinuity point in this region, the current regulator thus operates in an undefined manner in the region of small currents. The object of the invention is to propose a circuit arrangement which enables reliable operation of the current regulator even in the region of small currents. The object is achieved in that a control electronics element 16 is provided which presets the hysteresis  DELTA  I and the frequency of the current regulator 12 as a function of the current I.
