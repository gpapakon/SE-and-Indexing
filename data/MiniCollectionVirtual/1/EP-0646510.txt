<ABSTRACT>
A device for orientating, during travel along a curved track (13), 
the axles (7, 8) of a railway vehicle (1, 2) connected to at least 

one similar vehicle to form a train, each vehicle (1, 2) 
comprising, for its guiding and support along said track, means 

which contain one axle (7, 8), or several axles (7, 8) possibly 
associated with each other within a possible bogie, and which are 

positioned in proximity to the ends (9, 10) of the vehicle; at 
least one of the guide means of each vehicle (1, 2) forms part of 

a corresponding articulated structure connected to transmission 
and connection means (70, 71) which couple two adjacent vehicles 

(1, 2) and connect the articulated structures associated with the 
two vehicles together, said means (70, 71) providing articulated 

connection between the vehicles and, when on a bend, generating a 
movement of their axles (7, 8) which causes these latter to assume 

a position inclined to the longitudinal axis (F) of the vehicle 
(1, 2) and enable the wheels supported by them to follow the 

radius of curvature of the track (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device in accordance with the 
introduction to the main claim. During the movement of an at least two-vehicle train (railway, 
underground or tramway) along a curved track (ie on a bend), 
mutual stresses are known to be generated between the wheels of 
each vehicle and the rails, leading to wear of the contacting 
parts and hence the need for maintaining these parts at relatively 
frequent time intervals. This involves considerable cost. Contact between the wheels and track rails also gives rise to 
squealing and vibration which negatively influence the travelling 
comfort of vehicle passengers. In an attempt to overcome such problems, known arrangements 
associate the axles of each pair of wheels with movable bogies 
pivoted to the vehicle body and free to move about the pivot, or 
provide single axles interposed between the ends of connected 
vehicles and comprising means for their connection to both 
vehicles. The first known arrangement (used on railway trains, underground 
trains and trams) only limits this problem without properly 
solving it. In this respect, movable bogies to not achieve 
optimum reduction in the noise and vibration transmitted to 
passengers by the wheels when the vehicle or coach is travelling 
on a bend unless there is a considerable use of special 
soundproofing means and vibration absorption means interposed  
 
between the bogie and the coach body. In addition, the presence of bogies in proximity to the ends of 
the vehicle means that its floor has to be raised, with obvious 
consequences for the overall structure and the total height. The second arrangement (single axle with means for its connection 
between adjacent vehicles) solves some of the problems connected 
with the use of bogies (such as the increase in the vehicle 
height), but gives rise to parasite movements of the axles due to 
the mutual displacement which normally occurs between vehicles 
along a curved path. This has consequences both for the vehicle 
running stability and for the comfort of vehicle passengers. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a 
device for orientating the support and guide means (comprising one 
or more axles associated with each other in a bogie, wheels, brake 
discs mounted on the wheels, suspension members, shock absorbers, 
braking members and usual brake pads) of a railway vehicle which 
overcomes the aforesaid drawbacks in an optimum manner during the 
movement of the vehicle along a curved track. A particular object of the

<CLAIMS>
A device for orientating, during travel along a curved 
track, the axles of a railway vehicle connected to at least one 

similar vehicle to form a train, each vehicle comprising, for its

or several axles possibly associated with each other within a 
possible bogie, and which are positioned in proximity to the end
