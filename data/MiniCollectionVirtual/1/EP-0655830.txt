<ABSTRACT>
A high-efficiency analog power amplifier is disclosed. 
The amplifier utilizes pulse-width-modulation ("PWM") signals 
to operate electrical switching devices coupled in series 

across a d.c. power source. A resonant circuit coupled to the 
transistors periodically places zero and non-zero voltage 

levels across each transistor. The frequency and width of the 
PWM signals are relative to the components of the resonant 

circuit -- enabling each transistor to switch off and on only 
when zero volts appears across the transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to high 
efficiency analog power amplifiers and, more specifically, to 
pulse-width-modulation ("PWM") type amplifiers and zero-voltage-switching 
multiresonant converters. A typical PWM-type amplifier, i.e., the Class D 
amplifier, includes a comparator circuit coupled to the gates 
(or bases) of a pair of switching transistors that are coupled 
in series across a d.c. power source. The transistors are 
disposed in a conventional push-pull configuration. Reverse 
current by-passing or recovery diodes are also coupled in 
series across the d.c. power source, the junction of the 
diodes being coupled to the junction of the paired 
transistors. A low-pass filter is coupled to the junction of 
the paired transistors. The comparator creates a rectangle-wave PWM signal from a 
modulating input signal and a triangle-wave carrier signal. 
The PWM signal is applied to the gates of the switching 
transistors, causing the transistors to be alternately 
switched on and off in accordance with the duration of the PWM 
pulses. The resulting demodulated signal passes through the 
low-pass filter and is output to a load. Although highly efficient, conventional Class D 
amplifiers are subject to several drawbacks. The frequency of 
pulse width modulation in conventional Class D amplifiers is 
limited to a maximum of approximately 1 Mhz due to transistor 
switching losses. As a transistor is turned on and off 
rapidly, switching transients involving high levels of current 
and voltage occur, whereby high switching stresses and losses 
are imposed upon the switch. (A detailed discussion of such  
 
stresses and losses may be found in U.S. Patent 4,720,668, 
issued to Lee etal.) As a result, Class D amplifiers are 
restricted to operate in a bandwidth of approximately 50 to 
100 Khz. Such limitation can preclude the use of Class D 
amplifiers in high frequency applications since, for minimum 
distortion, the switching frequency of these amplifiers should 
be at least five times that of the highest frequency component 
of the modulating input signal. See, Grant, etal., Power 
Mosfets Theory and Applications, 314 (Wiley 1989). Furthermore, Class D amplifiers generate output 
distortion when their switching transistors are not operating 
simultaneously (i.e., one turning off while the other is 
turning on). This differential switching error can result in 
"switch conduction overlap;" i.e., both transistors conducting 
simultaneously and thereby creating a virtual short circuit 
between
