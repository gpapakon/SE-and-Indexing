<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of cleaning
floptical media, and in particular to removing microscopic
debris from the floptical media surface and grooves after
laser etching.US-A-4 869 090 discloses an apparatus for forming unevenness over a surface of a
base plate for a magnetic disc, said apparatus comprising rotating means, a chuck on
which is mounted said magnetic disc for rotating said disc at a predetermined angular
velocity, a sprayer adjustably disposed over the surface of said disc for spraying a low-temperature
gas containing ice-crystals onto said surface, sprayer angle adjustment
means connected to said sprayer for varying an angle of said sprayer in a
predetermined path at a predetermined speed over said rotating disc, said rotating
surface of said disc being sprayed by said gas for a predetermined number of
repetitions. Further, the document describes a method of using said apparatus. Recently, floppy disk systems have been developed
that combine magnetic disk recording techniques with the high
track capacity servos found in optical disk systems. Such a
system is described in AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INSITE 325
FLOPTICAL(R) DISK DRIVE, Godwin, which was presented at the
SPIE Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting (1989).
Essentially, an optical servo pattern is pre-recorded on a
magnetic floppy disk. The optical servo pattern typically
consists of a large number of equally spaced concentric
tracks about the rotational axis of the disk. Data is stored
in the magnetic "tracks" between the optical servo tracks
using conventional magnetic recording techniques. An optical
servo mechanism is provided to guide the magnetic read/write
head accurately over the data between the optical servo
tracks. By utilizing optical servo techniques, much higher
track densities are available on the relatively inexpensive
removable magnetic medium. As mentioned, the optical servo pattern typically
consists of a large number of equally spaced concentric
tracks about the rotational axis of the disk. As disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,961,123, each track may be a single
continuous groove (Fig. 3), a plurality of equally spaced
circular pits (Fig. 8), or a plurality of short equally
spaced grooves or stitches (Fig. 9). Various methods and
systems exist for inscribing the optical servo tracks on the
magnetic medium. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,961,123,
entitled "Magnetic Information Media Storage With Optical
Servo Tracks," discloses a method of an apparatus etching the
servo track pattern on a disk using a

A method of removing debris from a floptical medium after
laser etching, comprising the steps of :


a) mounting said floptical medium on a chuck having
a thermal mass, a laser-etched surface of said floptical

medium being placed distally to said chuck;
b) rotating said chuck and said floptical medium at
a predetermined angular velocity;
c) spraying a low-temperature gas containing ice
crystals onto a surface of said rotating floptical medium

until said debris are substantially removed, said ice
crystals colliding with said debris on said rotating

floptical medium and causing said debris to depart from said
floptical medium, and
d) maintaining said rotating floptical medium above
a freezing temperature during step c), said thermal mass of

said chuck being substantially larger than that of said
floptical medium, said thermal mass preventing said rotating

floptical medium from being frozen during said debris
removal.

disk, said spraying traversing from an inside to outside
radius, each stitch being sprayed by said gas for a

predetermined 
number of repetitions until said microscopic debris are

substantially removed, said ice crystals colliding with said
microscopic debris left in said stitches and causing said

microscopic debris to be removed from said stitches; and
d) maintaining said rotating floptical disk above a
freezing temperature during step c), said thermal mass of

said chuck being substantially larger than that of said
floptical disk, said thermal mass preventing said rotating
