<ABSTRACT>
An improved torque sensor, or relative angular 
movement sensor, comprises an input member (5), an 

output member (2), LED light sources (20), a pair of 
photodetector units (28a,28b) adapted to receive light 

from the LED light sources, and signal processing 
means, in which said signal processing means is adapted 

to receive output signals from the photodetector units, 
the output signals of the photodetector units being 

dependent upon the light signals which they receive, 
and the signal processing means being adapted to 

process the output signals from the photodetector units 
so as to produce a modified output signal indicative of 

the relative angular displacement between, or torque 
applied between, the input and output member, wherein 

the improvement lies in the arrangement of 
photodetectors which comprise the photodetector 

units (28a) and (28b). The photodetectors are arranged 
in such a way that any phase shift which may exist 

between the signals from the two photodetector units is 
cancelled out when the modified torque output signal is 

produced, in order to remove any 'ripple' in this 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved optical torque
sensors especially, but not exclusively, for
incorporation in power-assisted steering systems for
vehicles.In our European patent application No. 93300792.4,
which was not pre-published, a torque sensor is described which comprises an input
member, an output member, emitter means, first receiver
means adapted to receive a first signal, second
receiver means adapted to receive a second signal, and
signal processing means, in which said signal
processing means is adapted to receive output signals
from the first and second receiver means, the output
signals of the receiver means being dependent upon the
first and second signals which they receive, and the
signal processing means being adapted to process the
output signals from the first and second receiver means
so as to produce a modified output signal indicative of
the relative angular displacement between, or torque
applied between, the input and output member.In a described embodiment of the invention input
and output masks are associated with the input and
output members respectively, interposed between the
emitter means and the first and second receiver means.
In this embodiment each of the input and output masks
comprises an outer arc of angularly spaced apertures
and a radially spaced inner arc of angularly spaced
apertures, and preferably the inner and outer arcs of
the apertures, extend around a complete circle, forming
an inner track of apertures and an outer track of
apertures. The input and output masks move angularly
with the input and output members respectively and are
both centred on their common axis of rotational 
symmetry. The first and second receiver means receive
signals through the superimposed inner and outer tracks
of apertures respectively, and may each comprise first
and second effective receivers respectively.However, in a torque sensor of this construction,
with one or more effective receivers for each track, a
problem may be encountered if the two rotating masks
are not accurately concentric. Errors in the
concentricity of the masks can give rise to a variation
in the torque output of the sensor as the input member
is rotated at a given torque, the period of the
variation being equal to one revolution of the input
member. This variation, or "low-frequency ripple" can
cause difficulty in determining the zero position of
the sensor, since even quite small alignment errors can
cause variations of 10% in the sensor output.The ripple occurs due to periodic variations in
the signals
