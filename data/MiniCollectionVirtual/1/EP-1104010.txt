<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an incandescent lamp in which an unlit
state of the lamp caused by a hang-out of the coil as well as a

short lifetime thereof are prevented using a simple construction and
its lifetime in practical application is long, a coil (21)-like

filament (20) is held in a bulb (11) by upholding parts (30, 30')
with an axis of the coil (21) being oriented in a vertical direction,

and a coil pitch of the coil (21) at the upper part thereof is
made narrow as compared with that of the lower part of the filament

(20). Or the filament (20) of the incandescent lamp (10) is constituted
by the coil (21) of a conical shape or that of a frustum of a

circular cone, and the filament is arranged within the bulb (11) in
such a way that it may be held by upholding parts (30, 30') with an

axis of the coil (21) of the filament (20) being oriented in a vertical
direction and the one end of the coil (21) having a smaller

diameter being positioned upward.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an incandescent lamp that is turned
on with a coil axis of a filament being directed in a vertical direction,
and, for example, an incandescent lamp filled with inert
gas containing halogen.In the case of a usual incandescent lamp of the one-end sealed
type which is widely used, for example, a coil-like filament within
a cylindrical glass bulb is connected to upholding parts also acting
as an inner lead wire at both ends of the filament, and the filament
is held and arranged in such a way that a bulb axis of the bulb and
an axis of the coil are coincident with each other.In the case of such an incandescent lamp as described above,
the lamp is turned on while it is kept in a vertical orientation. In
doing so, it may sometimes happen that, when the time of the turning-on
operation expires, the coil of the filament is extended and
hangs out.In particular, in the case of an incandescent lamp with the
coil axis of the filament being oriented in a vertical direction as
described above, a load corresponding to the weight of the coil itself
is applied to the filament, resulting in that the stress of the
net weight of the filament increases from the lower end of the filament
to its upper end and the coil hangs out considerably at the upper
end of the filament.Since both upper and lower ends of the filament of the incandescent
lamp as described above are held and fixed by the upholding
parts, the filament length and the number of turns of the coil however
do not change, and when the coil hanging-down state is generated
above the filament the pitch of the coil positioned further below 
is gradually narrowed and the coils which are present adjacent
to each other in a vertical direction get in contact with each
other. As a result, a short-circuit state or a melting cut of the
filament occurred and turned off the lamp resulting in the problem
of making the lamp life short.In particular, in the case of an incandescent lamp in which the
turning-on or turning-off operation was repeated within a short period
of time under such a high temperature that the temperature of
the filament exceeded 2600 Â°C, for example, and the lamp was turned
on in a periodic manner, the hang-down of the coil was produced remarkably
often and caused the lifetime of the lamp to become quite
short.In view of the aforesaid problem, it is also possible to fix
the upholding parts not only to the upper and the lower ends of the
filament, for example, but also over a longitudinal direction of the
filament and to prevent the
