<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for the automated ejection of the worm from a worm extruder, in particular a worm extruder for producing dough and pasta. The invention is characterized by the fact that the process is automated and that the extrusion worm is of a suitable design. The invention calls for the worm to be ejected from the extruder by hydraulic means in one movement.

A method of automatically ejecting a screw (9), which comprises a header piece (10), 
of an extrusion press (1), characterised in that an overpressure, which acts against an 

ejection rod (15) in a chamber (11), is applied in an axial bore (14) of the screw (9) 
by means of a hydraulic fluid fed in via an admission bore (16), until the screw (9) 

is completely or partially ejected from the barrel (12). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that water is used as the hydraulic 
fluid. 
A method according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the screw (9) is embraced 
at a header piece (10) before the start of the ejection. 
A device for carrying out the method according to at least one of the preceding claims 
1 to 3, having a screw (9) which is mounted in a barrel (12) of an extrusion press (1) 

and which is detachably coupled to a drive shaft (4),
 
   characterised in that the screw (9), which comprises a header piece (10), has 

an axial bore (14) for the receipt and guidance of an ejection rod (15), wherein the 
ejection rod (15) is fixedly attached to the drive shaft (4) of the extrusion press (1), 

and that a chamber (11) in which the requisite ejection pressure is built up is formed 
from the wall of the bore (14), from an end face, which faces the bore (14), of the 

header piece (1), and from an end face, which faces the header piece (10), of the 
ejection rod (15). 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that in its operating state the 
temperature of the screw (9) is controlled with hydraulic media via the axial bore (14) 

and via discharge bores (13, 17).
