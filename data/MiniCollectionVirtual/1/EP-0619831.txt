<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a permanently 
removable, low melt viscosity acrylic pressure-sensitive 
adhesive. In particular, the present 
invention relates to an adhesive comprising a lower 
alkyl acrylate, a higher alkyl acrylate, a polar 
monomer and a crosslinker. Removable pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) 
adhered to a backing, which predictably adhere, yet 
remain repeatedly peelable from a variety of substrates 
over a long period of time without damaging or marring 
the substrate, have many commercial uses. For example, 
masking tapes, removable labels or office notes, 
protective films and medical tapes all must quickly 
adhere to metal, paper, plastics and skin, 
respectively, but must also peel smoothly away from 
these varied substrates without leaving behind any 
adhesive residue on or damaging the surface of a 
particular substrate. Ideally, depending on the substrate, the removable 
adhesive must provide sufficient tack (or quick stick) 
to quickly fix the adhesive to the desired substrate, 
adequate peel strength to prevent damage of the surface 
when the adhesive is removed, and have the appropriate 
cohesive strength to control the transfer of adhesive 
to the substrate. Cohesive strength must also be 
controlled in order to limit the cold flow of the 
adhesive on a surface, a process which leads to an 
undesirable building of peel strength over time. 
Balancing these pressure sensitive adhesive properties,  
 
particularly in a removable adhesive, poses 
difficulties to the formulator. U.S. Patent No. 3,691,140 (Silver) discloses the 
use of solid, inherently tacky, pressure-sensitive 
adhesive microspheres which, when adhered to a first 
substrate, may when contacted to a second substrate be 
easily removed from the second substrate without 
delaminating the first substrate or the second 
substrate. While exhibiting a high degree of 
removability, microsphere adhesives tend to transfer to 
contact surfaces such as the second substrate. U.S. Patent No. 5,045,569 (Delgado) discloses 
hollow, inherently tacky pressure-sensitive adhesive 
acrylate microspheres which, due to their unique 
morphology, provide enhanced peel and shear strength 
and less adhesive transfer to substrates than 
"repositionable" adhesives based on solid acrylatebased 
microspheres. U.S. Patent No. 4,599,265 (Esmay) discloses an 
adhesive having a high degree of cohesive strength. 
The adhesive disclosed is an acrylate, has low tack and 
maintains peelability from a variety of ordinary 
substrates. Esmay
