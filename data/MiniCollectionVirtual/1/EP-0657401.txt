<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a carbon-graphite composite material containing an embedded additive. So that the carbon-graphite composite material has a low coefficient of friction and low wear, it is proposed that the additive is one or more synthetic hard materials having a mean particle size of from 0.1 to 10  mu m.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a carbon-graphite material as sliding material
that is also intended for dry running with an additive

in the form of silicon nitride and/or boron carbide
having a mean grain size between 0.1 and 10 µm and a

weight content between 3 and 15 %.
Carbon-graphite material with embedded additive,

characterised in that

the additive is silicon nitride and/or boron carbide
having a mean grain size between 0.1 and 10 µm and a

weight content in the carbon-graphite material from 3
to 15 %.
Process for producing a carbon-graphite material
according to Claim 2, wherein fillers such as coke,

graphite and carbon black are added to one or more
additives, are mixed with a binding agent such as

pitch or synthetic resin, the mixture produced in this
way is ground down and is subsequently pressed and

thermally treated,

characterised in that

at least one synthetic hard material in the form of
silicon nitride and/or boron carbide having a mean

grain size between 0.1 and 10 µm is dispersed in the
binding agent and mixed with the fillers at a

temperature T, where 200 °C ≤ T ≤ 240 °C, and in that,
after being ground down and pressed, the mixture is

annealed at a temperature of approximately 1,300 °C,
whereby the fillers are added as a whole to such a

quantity of synthetic hard material dispersed in the
binding agent that the weight content of the synthetic

hard material amounts after the thermal treatment to 3
to 15 % of the carbon-graphite material.
