<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL PROCESS FOR PREPARING CHIRAL [ [ (2-BROMOETHYL) AMINO]METHYL] -2-NITRO-1H-IMIDAZOL-1- ETHANOL AND RELATED COMPOUNDSFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel method for preparing the enantiomeric forms of certain known race ic imidazole-1—ethanol derivatives which are useful as radiosensitizing or chemosensitizing agents. Novel intermediates utilized in this process are also involved as well as the chiral final products.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThe racemic mixture of certain compounds of the present invention is described in U.S. Patent 4,954,515 and 5,098,921. In particular. Example 2 of both patents describes the racemic mixture of the compound of Formula I set forth below wherein X is bromo. The racemic mixture of certain compounds of the present invention is also described generically as starting materials or intermediates in the following U.S. patents: No. 4,596,817; No. 4,631,289; No. 4,757,148. Additionally, the racemic mixture of certain compounds of Formula I is described generically in U.S. 4,241,060 as hypoxic—cell radiosensitizers. 

 SUMMARY OF INVENTIONThe present invention provides a novel process for the preparation of the enantiomers of compounds of the following general formula:Formula I0II wherein X is halogen or —O-S—R-, .II oIn Formula I, X can be chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine and preferably X is bromine or chlorine, and more preferably X is bromine, and Rχ can be OH, methyl, phenyl, or phenyl substituted as defined herein for R.The present invention also provides novel intermediates useful in the preparation of the enantiomers of the compounds of Formula I. These novel intermediates have the following structures:II HI I 

 The compound depicted as Formula II above is 3-[3- (2-nitro-lH-imidazol-l-yl) -2-[ (tri-R-silyl)- oxy]propyl] -2-oxazolidinone. Formula III is 3-[2-hydroxy-3-(2-nitro-lfl-imidazol-l-yl)propyl]-2- oxazolidinone; and Formula IV is (1-aziridinyl- methyl) -2-nitro-lH-imidazole-l-ethanol. Preferably, R in Compound II is methyl.The compounds of Formula I and each of the compounds of Formulas II, III, and IV exist in the (J )-(+) or (S)-(-) enantio eric form or in the (-R)-(-) or (S)-(+) enantiomeric form. The most preferred compound of the present invention is the (J)-(+) enantiomer of Formula I wherein X is bromo and this compound is depicted as follows:Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of Formula I are also within the present invention. These include salts of inorganic and organic acids, preferably inorganic acids such as
