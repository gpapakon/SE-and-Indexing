<ABSTRACT>
A propylene stream which contains propane as an impurity is contacted in a 
reactor A with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a 

hydroformylation catalyst thereby producing a product stream containing 
butyraldehyde and/or n-butyl alcohol, unreacted propylene and propane. The 

butyraldehyde and/or butyl alcohol are separated from unreacted propylene and 
propane in a condenser B and a product recovery unit C. The process 

additionally utilises an adsorptive separator D to separate propylene from the 
propane impurity. This adsorption is carried out at a temperature of 0 to 250째C 

in a bed of adsorbent which selectively adsorbs propylene, thereby adsorbing 
substantially all of the propylene from the gas mixture. The propylene is 

desorbed from the adsorbent and passed to the reactor A. The process is 
operated on a low per pass conversion with recycle of unreacted propylene. In 

the system of the invention the propylene adsorption unit D may receive feed 
solely from the condenser B and unit C (Figure 1) or may additionally receive as 

feed all the fresh propane and propylene entering the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for producing oxo products, and
more particularly to a process in which propylene, carbon monoxide and
hydrogen are reacted in the presence of a suitable catalyst to produce oxo
products, such as butyraldehyde and n-butyl alcohol, and unreacted propylene is
recycled to the reactor.Butyraldehyde is produced commercially by the hydroformylation reaction of
propylene, carbon monoxide and hydrogen over a suitable catalyst. The
reaction effluent is comprised of the butyraldehyde product, unreacted
propylene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and small amounts of byproducts.
Similarly, n-butyl alcohol is produced commercially by the hydroformylation-hydrogenation
of propylene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence
of a suitable catalyst. According to one commercial process for the production
of butyraldehyde, the reaction is conducted on a semi-batch basis in the mixed
gas-liquid phase in a stirred reactor at a temperature of about 130째C. and an
absolute pressure of about 14 atmospheres. The reaction is strongly exothermic
and part of the heat of reaction is removed by heat exchange and the remainder
is used to evaporate the reaction products so that they can be easily removed
from the reactor as a gas stream, thereby facilitating separation of the products
and unreacted reactants from the catalyst residue. After exiting the reactor the
gaseous product stream is cooled sufficiently to condense most of the
butyraldehyde product. The noncondensed gas stream exiting the reactor,
which include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, lower alkanes, including propylene
and propane, and some of the butyraldehyde is conventionally recycled to the
reactor. A small part of the recycle stream is purged from the system to
prevent buildup of nonreactive components, such as the lower alkanes. The
condensate is then stripped, preferably with steam, to remove residual volatiles
(mostly propylene and propane) from the product stream. After cooling the 
gaseous stripper effluent to condense the stream, the volatiles stream is recycled to
the reactor.A significant disadvantage encountered in the above-described process results from
the fact that industrial grade propylene usually contains small amounts, for example
up to about 10% by volume, propane. Since propane is not generally affected by
hydroformylation catalysts, the effluent stream usually contains propane, and the
amount of propane present in the effluent may be significant, particularly when low
purity propylene is used as

A process for the production of an oxo product from propylene comprising the
steps of:


(a) contacting a propylene stream containing propane as an impurity with
carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a reaction zone in the presence of a

hydroformylation catalyst under conditions which result in the
production of a product stream com
prising butyraldehyde (or other oxo
product), unreacted carbon monoxide, hydrogen, propylene and

propane;
(b) condensing the product stream so as to obtain a condensate
comprising most of the butyraldehyde and some propylene and

propane, and a first non-condensed gas stream comprising carbon
monoxide, hydrogen and some propane and propylene;
(c) separating a second gas stream comprising unreacted propylene and
propane from said condensate;
(d) passing through an adsorption zone containing an adsorbent which
selectively adsorbs propylene


(i) all or part of the first gas stream and all or part of the second gas
stream; or
(ii) all or part of the first gas stream, the entire second gas stream
being recycled to step (a), or 
(iii) all or part of the second gas stream, the entire first gas stream
being recycled to step (a)

and thereby selectively adsorbing propylene from the respective gas
stream or gas streams;
(e) regenerating said adsorbent, thereby producing a propylene-enriched
gas stream; and
(f) recycling at least part of said propylene-enriched gas stream to said
reaction zone, and recycling to said reaction zone any of said first and

second gas streams not passed to said adsorption zone;

A process according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
