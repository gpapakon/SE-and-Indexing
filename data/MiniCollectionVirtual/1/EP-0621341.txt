<DESCRIPTION>
Cytokines are a diverse group of compounds which exert 
various effects on the body's immune and inflammatory 
responses, both by way of direct action on the relevant 
cells, and by way of interaction and/or regulation of each 
other. In fact, endogenous cytokines may have both 
beneficial and adverse effects in the body. For example, 
the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 induces lymphocyte 
proliferation and other related activities which are 
essential in the body's mounting an immune response to a 
pathogen. In this regard, it is now known to be useful as 
an adjuvant in vaccine formulations and in treatment of 
infectious disease. IL-1 also functions as a mediator of 
acute inflammation. Although these reactions are desirable 
in the proper context, and in fact are essential to 
survival, excessive production of IL-1 can lead to the 
development of disease. In particular, excess IL-1 can lead 
to tissue trauma and organ dysfunction. The cytokine TNFα 
also has activities very similar to those of IL-1, but was 
originally identified by its association with necrosis of 
certain tumor types, and has been suggested as being the 
primary agent responsible for inducing shock and related 
syndromes. IL-2 is a cytokine, the major function of which is to 
stimulate lymphocyte proliferation and maturation, an 
obviously important function in immune response. 
Clinically, it can be used in treatment of tumors, and 
also, like IL-1, as a vaccine adjuvant and in treatment 
of infectious diseases. However, excess IL-2 can also 
produce such adverse effects as pulmonary and hepatic 
lymphocyte infiltration, lymphoid pleural effusions, 
eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, and capillary leakage.  Another hematopoietic factor, granulocyte macrophage 
colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), is also involved in the 
immune and inflammatory response processes. IL-1 is 
actually responsible for stimulating production of GM-CSF 
from endothelial cells and other connective tissue cells. 
GM-CSF itself causes production of new macrophages and 
neutrophils and primes mature macrophages and neutrophils. 
Therapeutically, GM-CSF has been used in treatment of 
cytotoxic injury, as well as in bone marrow manipulation. Both the natural and therapeutic functions of these 
cytokines are applicable in both man and animals. In 
particular, cytokine therapy is useful in food animals such 
as cows, and the roles of cytokines in the inflammatory and 
immune responses in cows has also been well established.

d 
G-CSF. 
A method for detecting the presence of a cytokine in 
bovine bodily fluid sample comprising contacting the 

sample with a substrate-bound first antibody which 
binds the cytokine, permitting time for an 

antibody-cytokine complex to form; contacting the 
sample with a second antibody which binds the cytokine, 

permitting time for a second antibody-cytokine complex 
to form; and detecting the presence or absence of the 

first antibody cytokine-second antibody complex, 
wherein at least one of the antibodies is a monoclonal 

antibody according to Claim 1.

A method for determining the presence of inflammatory 
or disease conditions in a bovine comprising 

periodically monitoring levels of IL-1 or TNF in bovine 
bodily fluid, whereby increasing levels of IL-1 or TNF 

in a monitoring period is indicative of the presence of 
an inflammatory or disease condition. 
A method of potentiating the activity of a cytokine, 
comprising providing an effective amount of an antibody 

which binds to the cytokine. 
The use of an antibody which binds to a cytokine for 
the manufacture of a medicament for the purpose of
