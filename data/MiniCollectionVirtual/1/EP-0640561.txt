<ABSTRACT>
A process for the catalytic partial oxidation of hydrocarbons 
comprises contacting a mixture of a methane-containing feed and an 

oxygen containing gas, which mixture has an oxygen to carbon ratio 
in the range of from 0.3 to 0.8, at a temperature of greater than 

900°C and at elevated pressure with a catalyst comprising a metal 
selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table supported on a 

refractory oxide having at least two cations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the catalytic
partial oxidation of of hydrocarbons, in particular a process for
the preparation of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen from a
methane-containing feed, for example natural gas or associated gas.The partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, for example methane or
natural gas, in the presence of a catalyst is an attractive route
for the preparation of mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen,
known in the art as synthesis gas. The mixture so-produced may be
converted into valuable hydrocarbon products, for example fuels
boiling in the middle distillate range and hydrocarbon waxes, by
such processes as the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis well known in the
art. Alternatively, the mixture may be converted into products such
as methanol by synthesis processes equally well known in the art.The optimum catalytic partial oxidation process for commercial
application would give high levels of conversion of the hydrocarbon
feedstock with a high level of selectivities to carbon monoxide and
hydrogen.The literature contains a number of documents disclosing
details of experiments conducted into the catalytic partial
oxidation of hydrocarbons, in particular methane, employing a wide
range of catalysts. Typically, these catalysts have comprised an
active metal selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of the
Elements (CAS version as given in the Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics, 68th Edition) supported on a refractory oxide carrier, such
as alumina or silica.Thus, European patent application publication No. 0 262 947
(EP-A-0 262 947) discloses a process for the catalytic partial
oxidation of methane using a catalyst comprising platinum and
chromium oxide supported on a refractory oxide carrier. The
catalyst specifically exemplified in EP-A-0 262 947 comprises silica
as the carrier material. A.T. Ashcroft, et al ("Selective oxidation of methane to
synthesis gas using transition metal catalysts", Nature, Vol. 344,
No. 6264. pp. 319 to 321, March 1990) disclose experiments conducted
using lanthanide ruthenium oxides of formula Ln2Sn2O7 for the
partial oxidation of methane. A range of lanthanides were tested at
a temperature of 777°C, a gas hourly space velocity of 40000 h-1 and
a pressure of 1 atmosphere. It was concluded by the authors that,
under the prevailing process conditions, the active catalyst
comprised ruthenium metal supported on a metal oxide carrier.Similarly, R.H. Jones, et al ("Catalytic conversion of methane
