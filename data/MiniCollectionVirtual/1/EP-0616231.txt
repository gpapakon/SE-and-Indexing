<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure a reflecting structure on a volume layer, at least one sound or ultrasound wave packet is emitted by a transducer matrix (1a), which wave packet arrives at the layer (4) coherently. The echo signals on each element (1) of the transducer matrix are processed separately, signals corresponding to the echos of each individual volume element (4a) onto all the transducers of the matrix (1a) being determined on the basis of defined transducer-element/ volume-element-distances (rnm) by means of a correlating calculation. The two-dimensional velocity field of the structure in the layer (4) is furthermore determined by means of two or more transmitted wave packets and evaluation of the resultant phase differences and frequency differences.
