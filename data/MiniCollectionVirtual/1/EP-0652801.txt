<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for continuous preparation of a fluid mixture, comprising a main conduit (1) for
conveying a main fluid (F) and at least one "by-pass" conduit radially disposed around the main

conduit (1) comprising a venturi pump including tubing (3) for administering one or more liquid
or semi-liquid additives (A) via jet eductor (2) such that a fraction (f) of the main fluid (F) is

removed by suction from the main conduit (1) for pre-mixing with the one or many additives
(A) prior to being reintroduced into the main conduit(1).
A method for preparing a fluid mixture, comprising supplying a main fluid(F) in a main
conduit (1), removing by suction a fraction (f) of the main fluid by at least one venturi pump

integrated into a "by-pass" conduit radially disposed around the main conduit (1), injecting
through an administering tube (3) via jet eductor (2) one or more liquid or semi-liquid additives

(A) to form a premixture (f') with the removed fraction (f) of the main fluid, reintroducing the
premixture (f') into the main flow circulating in the main conduit(1).
A method according to claim 2 further comprising measuring the flow rate of fluid F in the
main conduit after mixing with the additives (A).
A method according to claim 2 for preparing a cement slurry.
A method according to claim 2 for preparing a separation fluid or "spacer".
