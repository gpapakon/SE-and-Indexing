Tappet (2) comprising a housing (3) formed by a jacket (13) and a 
bottom (4) and in which there is concentrically arranged, a hydraulic 

clearance compensation element (8) comprised of a spring-loaded 
longitudinally slidable compensating piston (15) and a high pressure 

chamber (18), the compensating piston (15) being supported at one end on a 

valve shaft (9) of a gas exchange valve (10) and delimiting at the other 
end, by its piston face (20) facing away from the valve shaft (9) of the gas 

exchange valve (10), the high pressure chamber (18), said tappet (2) further 
comprising an idle stroke piston (11) having a diameter smaller than that 

of the compensating piston (15) and on whose piston face (19) the hydraulic 
pressure of the high pressure chamber (18) acts, characterized in that the 

ratio of the projected area of the piston face (20) of the compensating 
piston (15) facing the high pressure chamber (18) to the projected area of 

the piston face (19) of the idle stroke piston (11) facing the high pressure 
chamber (18) is 
>
3. 
Tappet according to claim 1, characterized in that the idle stroke piston 
(11) is arranged in a radial bore (37) of the jacket (13). 
Tappet according to claim 2, characterized in that the idle stroke piston 
(11) is arranged in an edge region (12) formed by the bottom (4) of the 

housing (3) and a part of the jacket (13). 
Tappet according to claim 1, characterized in that the idle stroke piston 
(11) is arranged in a bore (25) of the compensating piston (15). 
Tappet according to claim 4, characterized in that the idle stroke piston 
(11) is displaced along an axis of the bore (25) parallel to the central 

longitudinal axis of the compensating piston (15). 
Tappet according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that a stroke of the 
idle stroke piston (11) is limited at one of its piston faces (19) by a stop 

on a flange (35) of a valve cap (34) of a non-return valve (29) of the 
compensating piston (15).  

 
Tappet according to claim 1, characterized in that the idle stroke piston 
(11) is biased towards the high pressure chamber (18) by a spring (30). 
Tappet according to claim 1, characterized in that a gap (36) situated 
between a radial outer surface (16) of the idle stroke piston (11) and the 

bore (25) surrounding the idle stroke piston (11) serves as a leak gap for 
the flow medium present in the high pressure chamber (18). 
Tappet according to claim 4, characterized in that the non-return valve 
(29) of the compensating piston (15) is fixed on the piston face (19) of the 

idle stroke piston (11) facing the high pressure chamber (18). 
Tappet according to claim 9, characterized in that the valve cap (34) 
of the non-return valve (29) is fixed in a cylindrical recess (38) of the idle 

stroke piston (11).
