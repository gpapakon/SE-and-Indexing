<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, a continuous 
polymerization process is provided for the preparation of a rubbery 

copolymer by the non-aqueous dispersion random polymerization of a 
mixture of 30 to 65% by weight of a conjugated diolefin monomer, 

preferably butadiene, and 35 to 70% by weight of a vinyl 
substituted aromatic monomer, preferably styrene, in a liquid 

aliphatic hydrocarbon dispersion medium with an anionic initiator 
catalyst system in the presence of a block copolymeric dispersing 

agent which is continuously prepared in-situ. At least one block 
of the dispersing agent is continuously prepared prior to the 

dispersion polymerization reaction and a second block of the 
dispersing agent and a rubbery copolymer are continuously prepared 

in-situ during the dispersion copolymerization. The second block 
of the dispersing agent has the polymer structure of the 

continuously produced rubbery copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anionic styrene-butadiene
type rubber polymerization process conducted in a non-aqueous
dispersion utilizing butadiene-type and styrene-type monomers and
a dispersing agent formed in-situ during a continuous
polymerization process.In many prior art non-aqueous dispersion polymerization
systems, an organic dispersing medium has been utilized having poor
solvent properties for the polymer being produced. A dispersing
agent was therefore utilized in the organic medium in order to
disperse the polymer being formed throughout the medium. These
dispersing agents or dispersants were generally polymeric materials
such as block copolymers, random copolymers, or homopolymers as
described in US-A-4,098,980 and 4,452,960.Styrene-butadiene rubbers (SBR) have generally been prepared
in solvents in which SBR is soluble, however, only SBR's having a
styrene content of less than 35% are soluble in hexane or other
aliphatic solvents. These higher styrene content SBR polymers are
not completely insoluble in the aliphatic solvents, and, in fact, 
are highly swollen in these solvents. However, SBR's having a
styrene content greater than 35% necessarily have been polymerized
in aromatic or cycloaliphatic solvents via solution polymerization.The applicant first determined that certain pre-made
dispersing agents can be utilized to conduct the non-aqueous
dispersion polymerization production of SBR having a styrene
content greater than 35% by weight in aliphatic dispersing medium
such as hexane. Although the dispersion process using a pre-made
dispersant works well, it has one shortcoming from a practical or
commercial scale up point of view. The dispersant must be prepared
separately and stored for subsequent use in the polymerization
process. Storage tank and transfer lines require a large capital
expenditure and the synthesis of the dispersant and transfer time
into the polymerization reactor results in higher production costs.In these first dispersion SBR studies, a single diblock
polymer consisting of a short block (5%-10% of total polymer) of
hexane soluble polybutadiene and a long block (90%-95% of total) of
high styrene content SBR was prepared in the absence of a
dispersing agent. Synthesis of this polymer structure in hexane
resulted in either extremely viscous cements or the very
undesirable phase separation.It is therefore desirable to provide a continuous dispersion
polymerization process in which there is no need to store the
dispersing agent prior to the commencement of the
