<ABSTRACT>
Resin composed of an interpenetrating network (IPN) into which an organic phosphorous compound is incorporated. The IPN is composed of an allyl polymer network and an epoxy resin network. More particularly, a chemically incorporated phosphorus compound is present in at least one of the networks. Such an IPN can be produced by replacing at least one of the ingredients of an IPN-forming reaction mixture known in itself wholly or in part with an organic phosphorus compound which has at least one functional group reactive towards at least one of the other ingredients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic phosphorus compound-containing 
polymeric resin. Such a resin is known from European Patent Application 89103802.8, 
published as EP-A-384 940. In this publication an epoxy resin mixture 
is disclosed composed of an aromatic and/or heterocyclic epoxy resin 
free of phosphorus, an epoxy groups-containing phosphorus compound, 
and a particular aromatic polyamine as hardener. With no flame 
retardants being added, the resin is found to have a certain degree of 
refractoriness or fireproofness. This makes it possible for key 
ingredient of many present-day flame retardants, bromine, which is not 
very environment-friendly, to be replaced. Organic phosphorus compounds are indeed advisable bromine 
replacements. However, at least two drawbacks apply here. Firstly, it 
is generally found that the desired results, particularly with regard 
to Tg-value, are not obtained if phosphorus compounds are incorporated 
into known resins. This is also mentioned in said European Patent 
Application. Secondly, the degree to which phosphorus compounds can be 
employed in an environmentally safe manner has been insufficiently 
established. Hence it is preferred to use phosphorus compounds in the 
smallest possible quantity while maintaining sufficient flame 
retardancy (fireproofness, refractoriness), a significant demand which 
these days is notably made of the types of resins used in the 
electronics industry. Further, it is advisable from an economic point 
of view to be able to incorporate also relatively simple phosphorus 
compounds into resins, in which process tne resin should retain 
favourable properties. In US 3,524,903 a flame retardant vinyl ester resin is disclosed. The 
resin is prepared by reacting a polyepoxide with an ethylenically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid and an alkyl hydrogen phosphate ester.  
 Essentially, the polyepoxide is not employed as an epoxy resin, but is 
converted to vinyl ester resin. Flame retardance is attained by virtue 
of the phosphorus compound only in conjunction with halogen, which 
typically is introduced via the polyepoxide (using, e.g., tetrabromo 
bisphenol-A epoxide) in an amount of about 10-20 wt%. Hence, 
US 3,524,903 does not provide any teaching on the desired replacement 
of halogen. US 4,708,981 discloses a phosphorus or sulfur containing 
interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) comprising a mixture of a host 
polymer and a guest polymer, the host polymer being formed from 
phosphoric acids or sulfuric acid and a polymer or
