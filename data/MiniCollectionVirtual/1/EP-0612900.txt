<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a prefabricated building which comprises a self-supporting, segmented load-bearing structure fixed on a base slab, cellar floor or intermediate floor, the load-bearing structure having supports and projecting storey beams which are seated on the supports and are connected in a flexurally rigid manner thereto. The free ends of the storey beams serve to receive a roof structure which deviates from a flat roof design. The roof structure is made up of segment-forming, flexurally rigid, longitudinally connected bays and/or frames, the interspaces of the individual bays being filled with reinforcing panels, which result in the roof structure, together with the load-bearing structure comprising supports and projecting storey beams, form a static unit. In the case of the solid-building structure, of skeleton-type construction, proposed, the elements made up advantageously of steel or glued wood are fixedly connected to one another. By virtue of the roof structure proposed, in addition to the advantages in terms of static, the invention achieves an attic which, in terms of the effects of sound and heat, is of the standard of a residential room.
