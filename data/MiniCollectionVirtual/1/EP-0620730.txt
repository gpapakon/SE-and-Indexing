<ABSTRACT>
Prolamine fractions of grain proteins, applied in weight ratios of 5 to 100 % relative to the active agent being coated, effectively prevent the partitioning of water-soluble or water-insoluble drugs at neutral pH's in the mouth and thereby mask the taste of orally-administered drugs, which normally have a bitter taste, without sacrificing bioavailability. Zein, gliadin or a mixture thereof, particularly in combination with between 2.5 and 15 % of water-insoluble vegetable source oil or wax capable of plasticizing the prolamine fraction, when applied to particles, granules, tablets or other forms of drugs or nutritionals, to an effective thickness of about 1 to about 35 micrometers, in order to encapsulate and prevent release of an orally-administered pharmaceutical or nutritional in a suspension or chewable dosage form until such medicament reaches the stomach.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oral formulations which effectively mask the
undesirable tastes of drugs, such as antibiotics or benzodiazepines, and nutritionals,
such as dietary fiber or amino acid supplements, and other similar pharmaceuticals or
nutritionals with bitter or otherwise undesirable tastes. In particular; the invention
relates to taste-masked medicaments capable of being chewed or swallowed without
producing a bitter taste in the mouth.Oral administration of pharmaceuticals and nutritionals is one of the most
popular methods of delivery of such beneficial agents. Chewable or suspension
dosage forms are the preferred route of such oral administration for both children and
adults who have difficulty swallowing capsules or tablets, with palatability being an
extremely important factor in formulating these dosage forms in order to maximize the
likelihood that the recipient will take the pharmaceutical or nutritional.Because of the strong, unpleasant taste of many medicaments, flavorings,
either alone or in combination with sweeteners and other additives, have been
employed to improve taste and palatabilty. The formulation of a pleasant-tasting and
palatable product through the sole use of flavorings, sweeteners and additives,
however, has been unsuccessful in many medicaments which have a particularly bitter
taste, such as the macrolide family of antibiotics, in particular erythiomycin and
clarithromycin. Attempts have been made to formulate these antibiotics into
suspension dosage forms or into taste-masked chewable tablets using known coating
or encapsulation processes with very limited success.Tsutomu, in Japanese Patent Application 45-12759, published November 1,
1967, claims pharmaceutical compositions consisting of zein and
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) in coating tablets to mask taste and odor.
The application employs the high molecular weight polymeric HMPC component
(exemplified at levels of 10% and above) for its film-forming properties, in a coating
used to prevent the disintegration of Vitamin C as measured by temperature and time. Pescetti, in U.S. Patent 3,939,259, issued Feb. 17, 1976, employed
prolamine from corn grain protein (i.e., zein), with approximately an equal level of
shellac and a lesser amount of ethylcellulose, to coat digitoxin particles, but did so to
achieve a sustained -release effect. Since the incorporation of ethylcellulose may
interfere with absorption of the active agent in a timely manner, its incorporation into
the present invention for an

<CLAIMS>
An orally administered medicament consisting of
(a) a core of pharmaceutically active agent or nutritional

having a surface, and (b) overlaying said surface, a single
outer polymeric coating of from 1 to 35 micrometers thick

comprising a prolamine fraction of grain proteins and a
vegetable source water-insoluble oil or wax as plasticizing

agent for said prolamine,
wherein

the ratio of prolamine to plasticizing agent is from 40:1
to 20:3.
A medicament according to claim 1 wherein the ratio
of the pharmaceutically active agent or nutritional to the

outer polymeric coating is from 20:1 to 1:1.
A medicament according to claim 1 wherein the
prolamine fraction is zein or gliadin, or a mixture thereof,

and said prolamine fraction has been purified to 86-96%.
A medicament according to claim 1 which is in the
form of a suspension or a chewable dosage form.
A medicament according to claim 1 wherein said
pharmaceutically active agent or nutritional comprises an

antibiotic, vitamin, dietary fiber, analgesic, nutritional,
enzyme or hormone.
A medicament according to claim 5 wherein said
pharmaceutically active agent is a macrolide antibiotic.
A medicament according to claim 6 wherein said
macrolide antibiotic is clarithromycin or erythromycin.
