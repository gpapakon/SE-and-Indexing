<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dried aluminum hydroxide gel and a method for preparing 
it. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an antacid with the dried aluminum hydroxide gel 
as an active ingredient, which features excellent acid reactivity and acid neutralizing capacity, 
remains highly stable with respect to both of these properties as it ages, yet features good 
workability and storability. Dried aluminum hydroxide gel comes in amorphous powder form and has been widely used 
as an antacid. However, commercially available dried aluminum hydroxide gels are slow in 
reacting with gastric acid and are inferior in terms of their immediate effect. In addition, since 
such dried gels crystallize rapidly and age poorly during the reaction through the drying processes 
of their manufacture,as well as after their manufacture, they tend to have problems with 
decreasing acid neutralizing capacity. In order to solve this problem, a method has been developed in which an aluminum gel is 
used as an antacid in a slurry state without undergoing drying process. There is another method 
that has been used in an attempt to improve the conventional method of binding carbonate ions in 
the gel. This method, in which the alkali ion of the aluminum hydroxide gel is replaced with a 
divalent ion, such as Ca, to specifically bind the divalent carbonate ion thereto, thereby 
suppressing hydrolysis, is described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Tokukouhei) 
No.1-24731. With past methods in which the aluminum hydroxide gel is used in a slurry state, it was 
impossible to use the gel at low temperatures, as it would freeze. At normal to high 
temperatures, the gel also had problems with rot due to the proliferation of fungi. Therefore,  
 
such a method is not desirable in terms of storability and workability. In addition, the latter 
method of specifically binding the divalent carbonate ion featured a drawback: despite the binding, 
the aging process of the aluminum hydroxide continues, decreasing its acid neutralizing capacity. 
The conventional method of binding the carbonate ion featured a significant problem as well. 
With this method, the stability of th aluminum hydroxide increases as the number of bound 
carbonate ions increases. However, the Al2O3 content decreases to the same extent, 
significantly decreasing the acid neutralizing capacity of the aluminum hydroxide. The present invention has been completed under these circumstances. The object of the 
present invention is to provide an aluminum
