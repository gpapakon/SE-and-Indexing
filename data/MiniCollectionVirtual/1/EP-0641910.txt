<CLAIMS>
An espagnolette gearing to be arranged in the movable leaf 
portion of a window or a door for driving a locking bar fitment by means 

of a handle mounted rotatably on the movable leaf portion for actuation of 
the espagnolette gearing by means of a pinion meshing with a rack, the 

rack being coupleable to locking bars, characterised in that the pinion 
(8) can be arrested in the shift positions of the locking bar fitment by 

spring-loaded retaining means (20) which engage into gaps between the 
teeth of the pinion (8) and the other gaps between the teeth of the pinion 

(8) have a support means for the spring-loaded retaining means (20), said 
support means extending as far as the outer periphery of the pinion or 

almost as far as its outer periphery. 
An espagnolette gearing according to claim 1 characterised in 
that there are provided two mutually diametrally oppositely disposed, 

spring-loaded retaining means (20). 
An espagnolette gearing according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the support means is in the form of a wall web portion (29) between 

two adjacent teeth. 
An espagnolette gearing according to claim 3 characterised in 
that the wall web portion (29) is arranged in the central plane extending 

transversely to the axis of the pinion (8). 
An espagnolette gearing according to claim 3 characterised in 
that a plurality of wall web portions are provided in the respective gaps 

between the teeth of the pinion. 
An espagnolette gearing according to one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the rack which meshes with the pinion (8) has an 

opening for accommodating the wall web portion or portions.  
 
An espagnolette gearing according to claim 1 characterised in 
that for axial arresting purposes the handle (7) is provided with a 

resilient retaining means (3) which engages into an opening (24) in the 
pinion (8). 
An espagnolette gearing according to claim 7 characterised in 
that in the central position of the gearing the opening (24) extends 

generally outwardly by way of a slider (11) to the rack (15).
