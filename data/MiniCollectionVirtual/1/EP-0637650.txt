<ABSTRACT>
All wheel steer work vehicles are useful for 
working in conditions which require greater 

maneuverability and traction. When simultaneous work 
operations and steering is required, a control having 

both functions is required. The subject vehicle (10) 
includes a steering wheel (26) for steering a first 

pair of wheels (22), an implement lever (16) for 
controlling the implement work functions, and a switch 

means (15) for steering a second pair of wheels (24) 
mounted on the implement lever (16). This arrangement 

of components provides simultaneous movement of a work 
mechanism (18) and steering of the second pair of 

wheels (24) using only one hand of an operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control
arrangement for an all wheel steer loader and more
particularly to an implement function control lever
having an integral switch which can be actuated to
steer the rear wheels, independent of the front
wheels, while moving the control lever.Loaders are commonly used to load material
in confined areas and poor underfoot conditions
wherein the loader must be easily maneuvered and
controlled. To improve maneuverability, loaders
having all wheel steer capability were developed. The
rear wheels could be steered independently of the
front wheels or simultaneously with the front wheels.
One example of such use has a steering wheel to steer
the front wheels and a separate control box and system
to steer the rear wheels. A toggle switch was mounted
within the control box. One of the problems
associated with such a system is that the separate
control box was mounted on the console. With the
operator using one hand to turn the steering wheel and
the other hand to move the toggle switch no other
functions, such as loading, could be performed. If
the operator wished to perform any loading functions
he had to release one of the steering controls and
move his hand to the loading function control lever.
These functions could not be performed simultaneously. 
The present invention is directed to overcoming the
problem as set forth above.Further, attention is drawn to EP-A-0 300 774 which
discloses a materials handling vehicle having two pairs
of ground wheels moveable to effect steering of the
vehicle. Said vehicle comprises sensor means associated
with each of the two pairs of wheels to provide an
electrical signal to a control means when the respective
wheels are in an aligned position in which their axes of
rotation are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis of the vehicle. The control means including a
selector means comprising electrical switch means to
enable an operator to select simple steering mode in
which only one of the pairs of wheels are moveable to
effect steering, or a compound steering mode in which
both of the pairs of wheels are moveable to effect
steering. The control means further comprising means to
maintain this elected steering mode until an alternative
steering mode is selected by operation of the selector
means and the control means receives a signal from at
least one of the sensor means associated with one of the
pairs of wheels.WO-A-93/15927 discloses a steering stick for switching
components of a utility vehicle. In order to make
handling and

portion, said machine comprising:

first control means for controllably
steeri
ng the primary pair of front steerable wheels, said first means (12) including a steering wheel (26);
second control means for controllably
steering said secondary

pair of wheels (24) independently of the steering of said primary pair of steerable wheels positioning said rear machine portion
relative to said front machine portion; and
an implement control lever (16) for controlling
