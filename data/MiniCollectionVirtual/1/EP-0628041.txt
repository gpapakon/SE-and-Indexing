<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutically active
azacyclic or azabicyclic compounds, a method of preparing
the same and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising
the compounds. The novel compounds are useful as stimulants
of the cognitive function of the forebrain and
hippocampus of mammals and especially in the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease.Due to the in general improved health situation in the
western world, elderly-related diseases are much more
common now than in the past and are likely to be even
more common in the future.One of the elderly-related symptoms is a reduction of the
cognitive functions. This symptom is especially pronounced
in the pathophysiological disease known as Alzheimer's
disease. This disease is combined with, and also most
likely caused by, a up to 90% degeneration of the muscarinic
cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis, which is
part of substantia innominata. These neurons project to
the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and have a general
stimulatory effect on the cognitive functions of the
forebrain as well as of hippocampus, namely learning,
association, consolidation, and recognition.It is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease that although
the cholinergic neurons degenerate, then the
postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the forebrain and 
hippocampus still exist. Therefore muscarinic cholinergic
agonists are useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease and in improving the cognitive functions of
elderly people.It is well known that arecoline (methyl 1-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate)
is such a cholinergic
agonist.Arecoline however has a very short biological half life
and a small separation between central and peripheral
muscarinic effects. Furthermore arecoline is a rather
toxic compound.EP 0307142 discloses a class of thiadiazoles, substituted
on one of the ring carbon atoms with a non-aromatic
azacyclic or azabicyclic ring system, and substituted on
the other ring carbon atom with a substituent of low
lipophilicity, or a hydrocarbon substituent, which are
muscarinic agonists and useful in the treatment of
neurological and mental illnesses and severe painful
conditions.
EP 0384288 discloses piperidine compounds substituted
with either an oxadiazole or an thiadiazole group and
being useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,
severe painful conditions and glaucoma.
EP 0296721 discloses piperidine compounds substituted
with a heterocyclic group and having potent acetylcholine
agonist activity.
