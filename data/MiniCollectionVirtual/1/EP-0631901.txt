<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adjusting device for carrying out at least one adjustment operation, in particular for adjusting a motor vehicle seat, with a gear mechanism (23) which has a drive and an output and is equipped with a freewheel and a catch, and with an actuating unit (24) for producing a rotary motion in both directions of rotation at the drive of the gear mechanism (23). In order to improve the accessibility of the actuating unit (24) and substantially to increase the operational comfort, in particular when carrying out relatively large adjustments, the actuating unit (24) has an infinite stepping mechanism (25), which is connected to the drive of the gear mechanism (23), and a pivoted lever (26) which is to be controlled manually and with which repeatedly one step of the stepping mechanism (25) can be released, it being possible to set each desired angle of rotation and hence step within a maximum possible angle of rotation.
