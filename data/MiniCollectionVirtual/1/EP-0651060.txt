<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing an extra high tensile steel having a yield
strength of 1080 MPa or more that has a high strength
despite a low carbon content and is excellent in low
temperature toughness and stress corrosion resistance in
a stress corrosive environment, such as sea water and
salt water.In recent years, an ever-increasing demand for
energy has led to a growing interest in ocean
development, such as seabed resource development and
seabed crustal and geological survey, for the purpose of
ensuring a stable supply of the energy, which has
activated construction of containers for deep-sea use and
research ships for deep-sea use or ideas for construction
of seabed petroleum production bases in relation to deep-sea
development.When various containers are used in a deep-sea
environment, since a very high pressure is applied
thereto, it is required for materials for these
containers to have a high degree of toughness and
strength from the viewpoint of structure.In order to cope with the demand for safe,
reliable, high-strength and high-toughness materials, the
development of a Ni-containing low alloy steel and an
improvement in the quality thereof have been effected in
the art. For example, proposals have been made on many
production processes, such as a process for producing a
high-strength and high-toughness steel comprising Ni-Cr-Mo-V
with C + 1/8Mo + V > 0.26 and Cr≦0.8Mo as disclosed
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 56-9358, 
a process for producing a Ni-Cr-Mo-V-based extra
high tensile steel as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 57-188655, which enables a
high strength and a high toughness to be provided in a
wide cooling rate range in a quenching treatment, and a
process for a Ni-containing steel product, wherein very
low P and very low S treatments are effected for the
purpose of ensuring a high toughness. These processes
are effective for increasing strength or toughness.
However, in none of the steels produced by the above-described
processes, stress corrosion in an environment
that comes into contact with sea water or salt water
contemplated in the present invention is taken into
consideration, so that it is difficult to say that these
steels are sufficiently safe to use.Therefore, it is required for steel products to
have satisfactory resistance to stress corrosion cracking
in sea water.Examples of extra high tensile steel products
having a high reliability underwater include a Ni-Cr-Mo-V-based
high-toughness

ratio of diffusion type reverse transformed austenite
grains of 20 to 60%, quenching the reheated steel plate

and then tempering the quenched steel plate at a
