<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for handling a key-like dirt trap which can be introduced beneath a manhole cover, is provided with water through-passages (6) and is retained by the frame of the manhole cover. In this arrangement, at least one supporting bracket (7) is retained, at its two ends, at different circumferential locations of the dirt trap, such that it can be pivoted in said dirt trap, it being possible for the supporting bracket to be pivoted out of a plane in which it lies approximately parallel to the upper border (1) of the dirt trap, about an axis lying in said plane, over the opening of the key-like dirt trap. The curvature of the supporting bracket is preferably the same as, or at least similar to, that of the border (1, 3) of the dirt trap in the circumferential direction.
