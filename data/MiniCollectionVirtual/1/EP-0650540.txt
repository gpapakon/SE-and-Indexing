<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for a paper recycling process
in which cellulosic fibers are recovered from a bale containing waste papers.More particularly the present invention relates to a process of treating a bale
containing waste papers, which contains a mixture of cellulosic fibers, contaminated
cellulosic fibers and separated or freely dispersed contaminants.The term contaminants, as used herein, means materials
of a non-cellulose fiber character, such as wax, polymer
coatings, foil coatings, inks, dirt, stones, etc. The present
invention has wide applicability in the recycling of paper
products, for reuse in making paper.In existing processes for making paper, it is a common
practice to use waste paper materials either alone or along
with virgin pulp. The waste paper materials, recycled back
into the papermaking method, commonly include, e.g., rejected
paper stock in the plant, old corrugated containers, paper
bags, newspapers, magazines, used paper containers of various
types, office waste, mixed waste and old files. Some of these
waste paper materials have coatings thereon that interfere
with normal papermaking operations, e.g., wax coatings,
impregnated wax, various plastic coatings, and aluminum foil
coatings. Dirt, paper clips, wires, some inks and other
contaminants associated with waste papers may also pose a
problem.Before the waste paper can be used in the manufacture of
new paper, the cellulosic fiber content of the waste paper
should preferably be separated from the contaminants. The
separation method should be carried out in such a fashion so
as to minimize degradation or damage to the cellulosic fibers,
e.g., by cutting, shortening or weakening such fibers.It is known to recycle waste paper products by
mechanically breaking or tearing apart such products in a
pulper. However, such action damages and adversely changes
the physical characteristics of the fibers. Also, the pulper
does not always completely separate contaminants from the
cellulosic fibers. Another disadvantage is the fact that 
considerable energy is required to effect a desired separating action.FR-2406022 discloses the concept of putting loose ie. separated, material in a sealed
chamber, applying a vacuum, and introducing a debonding liquid.An aim of the present invention is to provide both a method and apparatus for extracting
relatively pure cellulosic fibers with desired strength potentials from bales containing waste
paper having contaminated and uncontaminated cellulosic fibers therein.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A paper recycling process in which cellulosic fibers are recovered from waste paper
material subjected to a fiber debonding treatment comprising submergence of the waste material

in a fiber swelling and debonding liquid while confined in a closed chamber (12) under a vacuum
for a period sufficient to liquid impregnate the submerged waste material after which it is

returned to an atmospheric pressure environment and subjected to fibrillation for separating out
swollen and debonded cellulosic fibers, 
characterized in that
 said fiber debonding treatment
comprises the steps of:


(a) positioning a bale form (10) of waste material containing waste paper within the
chamber (12);
(b) sealing the interior of said bale containing chamber (12) from the atmosphere;
(c) establishing a vacuum within said sealed chamber (12);
(d) introducing sufficient fiber swelling and debonding liquid into said sealed chamber
(12) as submerges said bale (10);
(e) maintaining said bale (10) within said sealed chamber (12) under vacuum while
submerged in said liquid for a period sufficient for cellulosic fibers of waste paper in said bale

(10) to sorb an amount of said liquid as establishes a debonding swelling to the degree that
application of fibrillation to said liquid treated bale (10) separates out said debonded swollen

cellulosic fibers.
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which non-sorbed fiber swelling and debonding
liquid is drained from said chamber (12) upon completion of step (e) of said fiber debonding

treatment and said fiber separation fibrillation comprises passing a fiber suspension liquid
through said liquid treated bale (10) contained within said chamber (12) for forming a slurry of

cellulosic fibers suspended in said fiber suspension liquid.
A process as claimed in claim 2, in which said fibrillation comprises directing high
velocity jets of said fiber suspension fluid into said liquid treated bale (10) in forming said slurry.
A process as claimed in claim 3, in which said slurry is removed from said chamber
(12) through a plurality of apertures in said chamber (12) sized to restrict passage therethrough

to slurry containing small particles of cellulosic fibers.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, in which a compressive force is 
established on said bale (10) following any one of steps (a) through (e) of said fiber

debonding treatment.
Wetting impregnation apparatus for the wetting impregnation of cellulosic fiber
containing material with a cellulosic fiber softening and swelling fluid in establishing a

debonding swelling of the cellulosic fibers of said material comprising:

a chamber (12) having an interior adapted to receive and contain said material therein
and seal said chamber (12) interior from the atmosphere,
means (39) for establishing a vacuum pressure within said chamber (12) interior and
means (35,37) for introducing into and retaining in said chamber (12) said softening
and swelling fluid for a sufficient time as establishes said debonding swelling of said fibers,
characterized in that
 said chamber (12) comprises:

a base (11) and a vertically displaceable hood (14) having a top portion (15) extending
transversely of a columnar annular wall portion (13) vertically depending below said hood

top portion (15) and cooperating with said base (11) in defining said chamber (12) when said

hood (14) is in a lowered position with the lower end of said annular hood wall (13) in
contact with said base (11) and
means (17,19,21) for vertically displacing said hood (14) between said lowered
position and a raised position in which said hood wall lower end is spaced above said base

(11).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, in which at least a portion of said hood top
portion (15) is mounted for movement within and lengthwise of said hood wall portion (15)

between a raised position and a lowered position in pressing contact with contents of said
chamber (12), and said chamber (12) includes means (23,25,27,29,31) for moving said hood

top portion (15) between said raised and lowered positions.
Apparatus as claimed in either of claims 6 and 7 in which said apparatus
additionally includes an agitator unit comprising:


a mixer (69) supported to be moveable between a retracted position below said base
(11) and an operating position projecting upwardly through said base (11) into the interior of

said chamber (12),
said mixer (69) having a post (71) rotatable about its axis supporting retractable
striker arms (87) pivotally mounted on an upper portion of said post (71) for rotation between 

a position housed within said post (71) and an extended position extended outwardly of said
post (71),
means (77,79,81) for rotating said post (71) about its axis and
means (83) for establishing movement of said mixer (69) between said retracted and
operating positions.
