<ABSTRACT>
A suspension system comprising a pair of FRP spring 
arms (5), right and left, and a beam assembly (6) connecting 

the respective free ends (12) of the arms (5). 
Having a free-end-side portion (12a) vertically 

bendable, each arm (5) serves as a suspension spring. A 
fixed end (10) of each spring arm (5) is fixed to a 

vehicle body (7). The beam assembly (6), which extends 
in the transverse direction of the vehicle body (7), 

includes an intermediate beam member (21) of FRP and 
metallic end beam members (20) fixed individually to two 

opposite end portions of the intermediate beam member 
(21). Each end beam member (20) is provided with an 

axle (11). If the right and left spring arms (5) are 
subjected to loads of opposite phases at the time of 

turning, the intermediate beam member (21) is twisted to 
produce a stabilizer effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suspension system 
used in a vehicle such as an automobile. Such a suspension system is defined by the features 
of the preamble of claim 1 and is described in 
"Automotive Engineer", 14 (1989), No. 3. Steel leaf springs or coil springs have conventionally 
been used as suspension springs for vehicles. 
Further, vehicular stabilizers have been used as means 
for increasing the rolling stiffness of vehicle bodies. 
Conventional stabilizers are formed independently of 
suspension springs. A stabilizer comprises a rod-shaped 
torsion section, which extends in the transverse direction 
of a vehicle, and a pair of arm sections continuous 
with the opposite ends of the torsion section. 
Generally, the torsion section of the stabilizer is supported 
on the vehicle body by means of brackets with 
rubber bushes. The arm sections are connected to axle-side 
components, such as a lower arm, by means of stabilizer 
links. The suspension coil springs, which are disposed 
vertically so that their axes extend in the vertical 
direction, have a great upward projection. Therefore, 
spaces for storing the upper portions of the suspension 
springs are needed in the trunk room or engine room. 
This results in a narrow interior space of the vehicle. 
Since the suspension springs and the stabilizer must be 
mounted separately, moreover, the whole suspension 
system requires a complicated structure and use of many 
components. Furthermore, it is hard to secure mounting  
 
spaces for the suspension springs and the stabilizer. A suspension system disclosed in Published 
Unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application 
No. 62-131905 comprises a pair of cantilever leaf 
springs, and a steel axle connecting the respective free 
ends of the springs. This axle is a substantially rigid 
body. In this conventional example, a stabilizer is 
required independently of the leaf springs. In this 
case, moreover, the axle is a long steel member 
extended between right and left wheels, and therefore, 
is inevitably heavy in weight.  
 A suspension system with the features of the preamble 
of claim 1 is described in "Automotive Engineer", 14 
(1989), No.3, page 8, Bury St. Edmunds, GB. This known suspension 
system for a vehicle comprises two hot press moulded 
spring arms incorporating continuous glass reinforcement 
constructed by filament winding and resin transfer 
moulding techniques and each of said arms is to be 
connected at a fixed-end-side portion to the vehicle body 
and at a free-end-side portion
