<ABSTRACT>
An in vitro test for determining the presence of leukocytes in a body fluid or tissue sample which is sensitive to the numbers of leukocytes typically found in inflammatory processes, such as diarrheal specimens, by testing the fecal sample with an assay utilizing an antibody for lactoferrin. Additionally, the test can be used to detect low white blood cell counts as low as about 200 WBCs/ul.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diagnosis of inflammatory
diarrhea by examination of fecal samples for leukocytes
or white blood cells (WBC).A need exists for a simple, reliable in vitro test for the
diagnoses of inflammatory process, such as fecal leukocytes (even
after they are morphologically disrupted), to indicate that a subset
of patients with the common problem of diarrhea that is inflammatory
and thus requires specific, more costly diagnostic and
therapeutic attention.Diarrheal illnesses are extremely common (causing 2 to 12 or
more illnesses per person per year) throughout the world, and often
pose diagnostic and therapeutic questions for the physician.
Fortunately, important diagnostic clues can be obtained by considering
whether the diarrhea is a noninflammatory process arising
typically from the upper small bowel, or whether it is an inflammatory
diarrhea arising from an invasive process in the ileum
or colon. Although the majority of cases are noninflammatory and
will often respond to simple oral rehydration therapy, it is important 
to distinguish the invasive, inflammatory diarrheas,
which are usually caused by Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter
or Clostridium bacteria, that may be, more severe and should be
the focus of more expensive culturing for these invasive
pathogens. The invasive, inflammatory diarrheas may also require
specific antibiotic treatment. A particularly helpful diagnostic
clue to distinguishing inflammatory from noninflammatory diarrheas
has been the examination for large numbers of leukocytes
(white blood cells or "pus cells") in the diarrheal fecal
specimens themselves. However, this requires that the physician
promptly examine mucus from a cup fecal specimen under a microscope,
stained for clearly distinguishable leukocytes in the fecal
debris. This requires the immediate availability of a skilled
person with a microscope to stain and examine fresh fecal
specimens in the clinic or emergency area where the patient is
seen. Despite extensive efforts, this is difficult to accomplish,
especially with this extremely common problem in a busy clinic
setting.There are many potential markers for leukocytes in the
primary and secondary granules. Leukocyte esterase was explored
as a potential marker for fecal leukocytes, since an analogous
test exists for leukocytes in urine. However, it was discovered
that leukocyte esterase was non-specifically positive for all
stool samples, both those with and without leukocytes. Prompt testing for the presence of leukocytes, using a

<CLAIMS>
A method for the diagnosis of inflammatory diarrhea,
by the examination of a fecal sample for leukocytes,

comprising the steps:

testing a fecal sample, which contains leukocyte, with
an assay utilizing an antibody to lactoferrin, that is sensitive to the number of leukocytes, so that lactoferrin serves as a

specific leukocyte marker; and
observing said sample for the presence of lactoferrin.
The method of claim 1, wherein a radioimmunodiffusion
assay is utilized.
The method of claim 1, wherein a latex agglutination
assy is utilized.
The method of claim 1, wherein a enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay is utilized.
A method for the detection of low leukocyte
counts as compared with the number of leukocytes typically found in inflammatory diarrheal specimens by the examination of a fecal sample for leukocytes,

comprising the steps of

testing a fecal sample, which contains leukocytes,
with an assay utilizing an antibody to lactoferrin, that is

sensitive to the number of leukocytes, so that lactoferrin
serves as a specific leukocyte marker; and
observing said sample for the presence of lactoferrin.
The method of claim 5, wherein said detection is
sensitive to as few as about 200 white blood cells

per Âµl of fecal sample.
