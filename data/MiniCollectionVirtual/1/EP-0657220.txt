<ABSTRACT>
A filter centrifuge comprises a filter drum which is mounted in a process housing so as to be capable of rotating about a horizontal axis and which is supported in a bearing in a self-supporting way, a drive for the filter drum and a machine frame which bears the process housing, the bearing of the filter drum and the drive. The machine frame has a base frame and a bearing frame which can be moved essentially horizontally with respect thereto. The process housing is attached to the base frame while the bearing of the filter drum is provided on the bearing frame.

Filter centrifuge having

a machine frame, which has a base frame (1) and a
support frame (2),
a process housing (3), which is attached to the base
frame (1) and has an opening (14),
a filter drum (4), which is cantilevered by means of a
mounting on the support frame (2) and is inserted through

the opening (14) into the process housing (3), in which the
filter drum (4) is arranged to rotate around a horizontal

axis, and
a drive (5) for the filter drum (4), the drive (5)
being arranged on the machine frame,

characterised in that
a displacement means is provided for displacing the
support frame (2) with the mounting and the filter drum (4)

in relation to the process housing (3) in an axial
direction of the filter drum (4),
that the displacement means has a displacement path
(10) provided on the base frame (1),
that the support frame (3) is disposed to run on the
displacement path (10),
that the filter drum (4) may be run along the
displacement path (10) through the opening (14) between a

first position, in which the filter drum (4) is inserted
into the process housing (3), and a second position, in

which the filter drum (4) is completely pushed out of the
process housing (3), and
that a rear wall cover (23) is provided on the support
frame (2), through said cover the opening (14) may be

tightly closed simultaneously with the filter drum (4)
running into the first position.
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the displacement path (10) is formed by rails (11), 

on which support rollers (22, 22') provided on the support
frame (2) roll.
Filter centrifuge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a rear wall (13) closing off the

process housing (3) towards the support frame (2) has the
opening (14), the width of which is larger than the

diameter of the filter drum (4), and that the rear wall
cover (23), whose contour and dimensions are adapted to the

opening (14) in the rear wall (13), is provided on the face
section of the support frame (2) pointing towards the

process housing (3).
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 3, characterised in
that at least one sealing element (24) is provided between

the outer circumference of the rear wall cover (23) and the
inner circumference of the rear wall opening (14).
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 4, characterised in
that the sealing element (24) is provided in a first

circumferential groove (25) In the rear wall cover (23).
Filter centrifuge according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the inner circumference of the

opening (14) widens in the manner of a cone towards the
support frame (2), and that the outer circumference of the

rear wall cover (23) tapers conically towards the process
housing (3).
Filter centrifuge according to one of Claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that a mechanical locking means is

provided between the rear wall (13) and the rear wall cover
(23).
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the mechanical locking means has at least one locking

element (26), which is moveable in the radial direction, is
supported on one of the two parts to be locked, the rear

wall (13) or rear wall cover (23), and interacts with a
locking counter-element on the other of the two parts to be

locked.
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 8, characterised in
that the rear wall cover (23) has a further circumferential

groove (27), in which a circumferential clamping ring (26')
provided with at least one radial slot (26'') is inserted

as locking element,

that by variation of the width of the radial slot (26''),
the clamping ring (26') is adjustable in circumferential

direction in the region of its radial slot (26''), as a
result of which the diameter of the clamping ring (26')

changes, and
that an inner circumferential groove (15) is provided as
locking counter-element on the inner circumference of the

rear wall opening (14) for engagement with the clamping
ring (26').
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 7, characterised in
that the rear wall cover (323) is provided with a flange

(323'), which engages over the rear wall opening (314) and
can be fastened to the rear wall (313).
Filter centrifuge according to Claim 10, characterised in
that screwbolts (323'') are provided to fasten the flange

(323') to the rear wall (313).
Filter centrifuge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the rear wall (13) is fixedly

connected to the base frame (1), and that the process
housing (3) is removably fastened to the rear wall (13). 
Filter centrifuge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a sealing cover (14') independent of

the support frame (2) is provided for the rear wall opening
(14).
Filter centrifuge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the drive (5) of the filter drum (4)

has a drive motor (50) disposed on the base frame (1) and
also a transmission element (51) provided between the drive

motor (50) and the filter drum shaft (40) driving the
filter drum (4).
Filter centrifuge according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the rear wall (13) is part of a

partition wall between a clean room receiving the process
frame (2) and a machine room receiving the base frame (1)

and the support frame (2) of a building surrounding the
filter centrifuge.
