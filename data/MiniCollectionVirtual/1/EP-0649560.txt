<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes a process to separate magnesium from magnesium slag when the magnesium slag contains radioactive thorium and its daughters. The process concentrates the radioactive thorium and its radioactive daughters from the magnesium slag and reduces the volume of the radioactive waste that requires disposal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for removing radioactive thorium and 
its radioactive daughters from magnesium slag and for reducing the volume of the 
radioactive waste that requires disposal. Radioactive waste sites exist in the United States that contain large volumes of 
material, several sites are in excess of 100,000 cubic yards. The number of such sites and 
concern for their management has significantly increased over recent years because of 
renewed concern over environmental issues, including the disposal of radioactive waste. The 
best method for the removal of radioactivity from such sites and their long term disposal 
requirements concerns many governmental agencies and private industry. The number of 
these sites that can treat and handle the huge amounts of radioactive waste are limited, due 
in part to the difficulty in identifying and siting new treatment and disposal facilities. Usual processing of these radioactive sites requires the treatment of large 
quantities of material, only a portion of which is in fact usually radioactive. Because of 
tremendous difficulties in economically treating such massive quantities of material to 
remove the radioactive portion and also meet the radioactivity level requirements for 
disposal set by government agencies, the best disposal method employed to date has been 
burial of the radioactive material. The burial method requires hauling large quantities of 
material, that are regulated as radioactive waste material, frequently many miles to an 
approved burial site. Therefore, economical methods for the reduction of the volume of the 
radioactivity for disposal at these sites have been actively sought. Several methods for a volume reduction of radioactive waste have been 
explored in the literature. Examples of review articles that describe the issues are: 
Energy Digest15(4), 10-16 (1986),"World Status of Radioactive Waste 
Management" ; Karl Heinz et al., Nuclear Engin, and Design118, 115-122 (1990), "Volume 
Reduction, Treatment and Recycling of Radioactive Waste" ;

A process for separating magnesium from a magnesium 
slag using water and carbon dioxide, which process 

comprises: 

a. forming an aqueous magnesium slurry from the 
magnesium slag, which slag contains radioactive 

thorium and its daughters, and water; 
b. solubilizing magnesium from the magnesium slurry 
by reacting the aqueous magnesium slurry with 

carbon dioxide; 
c. selectively concentrating by filtration the 
radioactive thorium and its daughters, such that 

the radioactive thorium and its daughters are 
separated from the solubilized magnesium 

filtrate; and 
d. reducing volume and/or weight of radioactive 
solids for disposal as radioactive waste. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the volume and/or 
weight of radioactive solids for disposal as radioactive 

waste is reduced by at least 50%. 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the volume and/or 
weight of radioactive solids for disposal as radioactive 

waste is reduced by from 50% to 90%. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the concentration of radioactivity from radioactive thorium 

and its daughters is increased by at least 200% from that 
present in the magnesium slag.  

 
The process of Claim 4, wherein the concentration of 
radioactivity is increased by from 200% to 1,000% from that 

present in the magnesium slag. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein

The process of Claim 6, wherein the ratio of water 
magnesium slag is from 1:1 to 10:1. 
The process of Claim 7, wherein the ratio of water to 
magnesium slag is from 1:1 to 5:1. 
The process of Claim 8, wherein the ratio of water to 
magnesium slag is about 3:1. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the carbon dioxide is at a pressure of from greater than 

ambient to 1,000 psig (7,000 kPa). 
The process of Claim 10, wherein the carbon dioxide is 
at a pressure of from 50 to 500 psig (450 to 3,500 kPa). 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the volume of radioactive solids is further reduced after 

Step (d) by compacting the solids. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
after Step (d) the volume and/or weight of radioactive 

solids is further reduced by heating the solids. 
The process of Claims 12 and 13, wherein after Step (d) 
the volume and/or weight of radioactive solids is further 

reduced by both compacting and heating the solids.  
 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the magnesium slag is heated prior to addition of the water

The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
Steps (a) to (d) are repeated from 1 to 20 times. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein

to 70째C. 
The process of Claim 17, wherein the carbon dioxide is

The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the solubilized magnesium is essentially free of 

radioactivity from radioactive thorium and its daughters. 
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
barium sulfate is added to the magnesium slurry after Step
