<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the extrusion of multiaxially
oriented articles of manufacture having a planar morphology from
thermotropic liquid crystalline
polymers (homopolymers, copolymers, and the like) and blends
containing thermoplastic flexible polymers and thermotropic
liquid crystalline polymers. Preferred thermoplastic flexible
polymers include polyimide, polypropylene, polycarbonate and
polystyrene. Preferred thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers
include those commercially available thermotropic polymers sold
under the trade names of XYDAR® LCP and VECTRA® LCP.There is a growing demand for high temperature and high
performance polymers. It is particularly desirable to be able
to control the molecular orientation of such polymers and to
tailor the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to optimize
properties.Polymers having improved properties have been obtained by
the incorporation of reinforcing fibers, such as, glass, carbon 
and aramid, to form fiber reinforced polymers. However,
disadvantages well known to those of ordinary skill in the art
accompany the use of each of these reinforcing fibers.Performance gains over fiber reinforced polymers have been
achieved by blending thermoplastic flexible polymers (TFPs) with
thermotropic rigid-rod polymers which are also called
thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers (TLCPs). These blends
are sometimes referred to as polymer microcomposites.Thermoplastic polymers used in making reinforced polymer
composites, such as those described above, include a wide range
of thermoplastics, such as polyimides, polyethylene, polystyrene
and copolymers thereof, polyamides, polycarbonates,
polyetherimide and polyesters such as polybutylene
terephthalate. These thermoplastic polymers are either
amorphous or semi-crystalline and may be called flexible chain
polymers, since individual monomer units in the polymer chain
are free to rotate with respect to each other so that the
polymer chain may assume a random shape.Thermotropic LCPs are a relatively new class of polymeric
materials which combine the advantages of melt processability
and outstanding mechanical properties. Due to their rigid-rod
molecular conformation and capability to form highly oriented
crystalline structures, i.e., an ordered phase when subjected to
shear above their melting point, they form products with
properties similar to fiber reinforced composites. However, if
the orientation of the polymer is in only one direction, such
products are not suitable for applications requiring strength in
more
