<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a modified polyaminoamide with 
markedly increased reactivity as an epoxy resin curing agent is 

disclosed. The process comprises introducing amino groups and 
mercapto groups into a polyaminoamide by using an aziridine 

compound and a thiirane compound. The modified polyaminoamide is 
capable of curing an epoxy resin at a low temperature and at a 

high rate to provide a cured epoxy resin excellent in anticorrosion 
and chemical resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing a 
modified polyaminoamide and more particularly to a process for 
producing a modified polyaminoamide having excellent curing 
properties, comprising introducing highly reactive amino groups 
and mercapto groups into a polyaminoamide molecule known as an 
epoxy resin curing agent. The modified polyaminoamide thus 
obtained is useful as an epoxy resin curing agent. A polyaminoamide is one of curing agents for epoxy 
resins and "polyaminoamide" is a general term for compounds which 
contain a plurality of active amino groups and at least one amide 
bond per molecule (according to "International Organization for 
Standardization"). A polyaminoamide is chiefly obtained by condensation 
between a polymeric fatty acid such as a dimeric acid 
or a trimeric acid and a polyamine compound such as polyethylene-polyamine. 
Since the polymeric fatty acid is a mixture 
comprising from 70 to 80% by weight of a dimer, from 15 to 25% by 
weight of a trimer and a tetramer, and not more than 10% by 
weight of a monomeric fatty acid, a variety of polyaminoamides 
are produced with variations of the kind or amount of the 
polyamine compound to be reacted with the polymeric fatty acid.  
 
Thus, the structural composition of polyaminoamides cannot be 
expressed in a simple manner. The above-mentioned polyaminoamides are mainly employed 
as a cold-cure (i.e. at room temperature)type curing agent for 
epoxy resins. However, compared with polyamine compounds also 
used as an epoxy resin curing agent, the polyaminoamide is less 
reactive, with the number of amino groups being equal, because of 
the increased molecular weight due to the condensed polymeric 
fatty acid. As a result, it takes longer time for the former to 
achieve complete curing. Where it is demanded to cure an epoxy resin at a higher 
rate or in a lower temperature, a polythiol compound is often 
employed as a curing agent. However, in order that a polythiol 
compound may exhibit rapid curing properties or cold curing 
properties, a basic compound must be used in combination as a 
curing accelerator. Additionally, most of the currently employed 
polythiol compounds are polythioalkylcarboxylates obtained by the 
reaction between a thioalkylcarboxylic acid and a polyhydric 
alcohol, and the presence of an ester bond in the resulting 
molecule makes such polythiol compounds inferior in chemical 
resistance, particularly alkali resistance. Therefore, epoxy 
resins cured by the use of the polythioalkylcarboxylates are
