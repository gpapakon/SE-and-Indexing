<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel injectable parasiticide composition, comprising
a compound of formula (I) wherein R is a propyl (ricobendazole) or a phenyl

(oxphendazole) group, preferably to be used in the veterinary field, in a
concentration of about 10% (w/v) in relation to the final volume, a first solvent

selected from ethanol and isopropanol, an inorganic acid and the required
quantity of propylene glycol up to the 100% of the final volume.
The process for its preparation comprises adding to a first solvent the
sufficient amount of said compound of formula (I) to achieve a final

concentration of about 10% (w/v), followed by the addition of an inorganic
acid; heating at a temperature ranging from 45° to 70°C until total dissolution,

adding the required amount of propylene glycol up to the 100% of the final
volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to an injectable
antiparasitary composition and a process for its preparation. More particularly,
the present invention refers to a new injectable composition of a
benzimidazole derivative having the formula (I):

where R is a propyl or phenyl group.The search of antiparasitary compositions has been of
relevant interest for the veterinary pharmaceutical industry. The development
of antihelminthic compounds having better quality for the control and treatment
of the gastrointestinal and pulmonary diseases caused by the nematodes
which are of the greatest impact on bovine cattle has been a relevant aim.The first important progress in this field took place in
1938 with the phenotiazin discovery. When the thiabendazole was brought into
the market in 1961, the first antiparasitary based on benzimidazole was
introduced and constitutes a new and important advance of the veterinary
pharmaceutical industry for the development of antihelminthic compounds with
better qualities.Desirable features of an effective antiparasitary
compound are:
a) Broader spectrum of antiparasitary activity,b) Reasonable cost,c) Doses which do not cause side effects,d) Practical way of administration, ande) Brief period of restriction post-treatment.From the sixties, when the thiabendazole was
discovered, several modifications that have been made to the benzimidazole
molecule allowed the appearance of different compounds that belong to the
group of benzimidazoles. Various chemical changes in position 2 and 5 of the
ring system of the molecule produced the strongest drugs of the group. Mainly,
those that contain an atom of sulphur in position 5, such as phenbendazole
and albendazole, with high effectiveness against gastrointestinal and
pulmonary nematodes, both adults and inhibited larvae and eggs.When a benzimidazole is administrated by enteral way,
as a suspension form, the particles must dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids,
in order to favor the absorption of the active principle through the
gastrointestinal mucus. Mainly, this can be observed in ruminants, since the
ruminal bacteria metabolize the benzimidazoles, thus making them more
effective. More than one dose must be applied in order to achieve the same
effect in monogastric animals.Drugs with more hidrosolubility such as thiabendazole
and cambendazole, dissolve totally in the ruminal fluid and are quickly
absorbed. The more modern benzimidazole compounds such as albendazole,
phenbendazole and their active metabolites show poor solubility in
