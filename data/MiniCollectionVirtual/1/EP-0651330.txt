<ABSTRACT>
Dynamic data exchange (DDE) is a process where updates to a data 
item in one application are notified or copied to a second application. 

According to the invention, the first application is on one machine, and 
the second application is running on a second computer. Both the first 

and second machines are running conferencing applications, and are 
connected by a communications link over a computer network. The first 

application engages in a DDE conversation with the conferencing 
application on the first computer, and the second application engages in 

a DDE conversation with the conferencing application on the second 
computer. Updates received from the first application by the 

conferencing application on the first computer are transmitted over the 
network to the conferencing application on the second computer, which 

can then copy or notify them to the second application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of providing dynamic
data exchange (DDE) over a computer network, in which updates made by a
first application at a first computer in the network are copied to a
second application at a second computer in the network.A personal computer running a multi-tasking operating system such
as OS/2 or Windows can support more than one application running
simultaneously. It is sometimes necessary for a user to be able to copy
data from one application to another, for example to copy numbers from a
spreadsheet into a report being prepared on a wordprocessor. One way of
performing this transfer is to write the data from the first application
into a file on the hard disk, and then retrieve the file into the second
application. This is simple but relatively cumbersome.The OS/2 and Windows operating systems provide a more
sophisticated facility, known as the clipboard, for performing such an
operation. Applications copy data onto the clipboard (effectively a
piece of memory which they then surrender to the operating system).
Another application can then interrogate the operating system to find
out what is available on the clipboard, and if desired take a copy of
the data from the clipboard. Normally an application will write the data
into the clipboard in several different formats, and the receiving
application will then specify in which of these data formats it would
like to receive the data. There are several standard formats, which are
available for all applications to use. The clipboard can be used for
exchanging text, images, and so on.One slight complication is that the clipboard supports delayed
rendering. In this case, the data itself is not supplied to the
clipboard for a particular format, rather only a reference to the data.
The data itself is supplied by the originating application only when
that particular format is requested by another application. It is 
possible to use delayed rendering for some, all or none of the formats
for any particular piece of data posted to the clipboard.A typical situation in which a user might employ the clipboard
function would be to copy a portion of text from one document to
another. The user (generally with a mouse and cursor) would first
identify the text to be copied, and then select the appropriate menu
option to place this text in the clipboard. The application would then
pass the text to the operating system in a variety of formats - for
example, as a text file, as a bit map, as a metafile, as a miniature
document complete

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing dynamic data exchange (DDE) over a computer
network, in which updates made by a first application (APPN A) at a first

computer (A) in the network are copied to a second application (APPN B) at a second
computer (B) in the network, said first and second computers each running a

conferencing application (P2P-A, P2P-B), the method comprising the steps of:

performing DDE between the first application and the conferencing
application running on the first computer;
transmitting updates received by the conferencing application on
the first computer from the first application to the conferencing

application on the second computer; and
performing DDE between the conferencing application running on the
second computer and the second application, whereby the updates received

by the conferencing application on the second computer are supplied to
the second application.
The method of claim 1, further comprising initiating the DDE over
the computer network by the following steps:


submitting (320) material from the first application to the clipboard on
the first computer;
receiving (330) notification at the conferencing application on the
first computer that the first application has submitted material to the

clipboard, and obtaining a list of available formats for said submitted
material;
transmitting (350) the list of available formats to the second computer;
submitting (360) the list of available formats to the clipboard on the
second computer;
responsive to a request from the second application, commencing
DDE between the conferencing application on the second computer and the

second application, and transmitting said request from the conferencing
application on the second computer to the conferencing application on

the first computer;
and responsive to the receipt of said request at the first
computer, commencing DDE between the conferencing application on the

first computer and the first application.
The method of claim 2, further comprising the step 470 of the
conferencing application at the second computer changing the data

associated with the format corresponding DDE by replacing the 
application name therein with a name containing an identifier of the

first computer.
The method of claim 2 or 3, wherein the list of available formats
are submitted to the clipboard on the second computer using delayed

rendering.
The method of any preceding claim, further comprising the step of
generating (530 640) unique identifiers for the DDE conversation at each of said

first and second computers, and using (720) the pair of unique identifiers to
identify the DDE conversation.
The method of any claim 5, further comprising the steps (560) of the
conferencing applications on the first and second computers each

maintaining window handles, and associating with said window handles
said pair of unique identifiers.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said first and second
computers run first and second operating systems.
The method of claim 7, where in all messages are sent between
computers in a format compatible with said first operating system, and

the method further comprises the steps at the computer running said
second operating system of converting messages for transmission to the

computer running the first operating system into said format, and
converting messages received from the computer running the first

operating system out of said format.
A computer workstation supporting dynamic data exchange (DDE) over
a computer network, in which updates made by a first application (APPN A) at the

computer workstation are copied over the network to a second application (APPN B)
at a remote computer workstation, the computer workstation comprising:


means for performing DDE between the first application and a first
conferencing application (P2P-A) on the computer workstation;
means for transmitting updates received by the first conferencing
application to a second conferencing application (P2P-B) on the remote computer;
means for receiving messages from the second conferencing
application on the remote computer; and 
means, responsive to said received messages, for sending DDE
messages from the first conferencing application to said first

application.
