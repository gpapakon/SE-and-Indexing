<DESCRIPTION>
FLUORINATION CATALYST AND PROCESSThis invention relates to an improved fluorination catalyst and to a process for the production of fluorinated hydrocarbons by the catalysed reaction of hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons with hydrogen fluoride. The invention relates in particular to a promoted alumina, halogenated alumina or aluminium oxyhalide catalyst and relates in a particular embodiment to a process for the production of 1,1 ,1,2-tetrafluoroethane by the catalysed reaction of l-chloro-2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane with hydrogen fluoride .The production of fluorinated hydrocarbons, which may also contain halogen atoms other than fluorine, by the catalysed vapour-phase fluorination of hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons with hydrogen fluoride is well known and numerous catalysts have been proposed for use in such process. Catalysts comprising or based on chromium and in particular chromia are frequently employed in the known processes. Furthermore, it has also been proposed to promote the activity of these chromium containing catalysts by the incorporation in the catalyst of an activity promoting amount of certain metals, for example zinc, nickel, cobalt and manganese.Thus, for example chromia or a halogenated chromia may be used in the vapour-phase reaction of trichloroethylene with hydrogen fluoride to produce l-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane as described in GB Patent 1,307,224 and in the vapour-phase reaction of l-chloro-2,2, 2-trifluoroethane with hydrogen fluoride to produce 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane as described in GB Patent 1,589,924. The same catalyst may be used for the fluorination of chlorodifluorethylene to l-chloro-2 ,2,2-trifluoroethane . GB Patent 1,589,924 describes the removal of chlorodifluoroethylene impurity from 1,1,1 ,2-tetrafluoroethane by reacting the impurity with hydrogen fluoride. 

 Catalysts may also comprise chromium upon a metal oxide, halogenated oxide or oxyfluoride support, for example alumina or magnesia, and during the fluorination process in which the catalyst is employed, the chromium may be5 converted to chromia, halogenated chromia or a chromium oxyfluoride. It has now been found that whilst in the absence of chromium, these supports show very little catalytic activity alone, some supports may be given a significant activity by the incorporation of an activity Q promoting amount of zinc.According to the present invention there is provided a chromium-free fluorination catalyst comprising an activity-promoting amount of zinc or a compound of zinc supported
