<ABSTRACT>
Set of connectable modular elements particularly for 
forming gates and/or the like, comprising: two first tubular 

profiled elements (3) which are provided in order to form 
outer supporting post tubes that can be engaged in the 

ground in upright position; four second tubular profiled 
elements (5) and associated mutual connection means (6) 

suitable to detachably mutually connect the four second 
tubular profiled elements (5) in order to form a first outer 

frame; hinge elements (11) for the oscillating coupling of 
the first outer frame to one of the supporting posts (3); 

and four substantially flat strip-like third profiled 
elements (9) and associated mutual connection means (6) 

which are suitable to detachably but rigidly couple the 
third profiled elements (9) and the second profiled elements 

(5) to form a second internal frame for supporting a barrier 
net (R) and/or the like, closure means (21) being 

furthermore provided to detachably couple the outer frame to 
the other tubular post (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a set of connectable 
modular component elements including metal profiled elements 
and elements for their mutual connection, particularly for 
forming an easy-to-assemble modular gate. As is known, the need is currently strongly felt to 
have gates that can be associated with enclosures made of 
metal net and/or the like. This need is generally met by specifically ordering 
said gates to specialized smiths or craftsmen: this 
naturally entails drawbacks, the main one being the 
significant cost of the gate, combined with its non-immediate 
availability. Transport of the finished gate 
furthermore requires pickup trucks and is in any case 
difficult. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention is to 
provide a set of modular component elements that can be 
easily assembled by the user himself, in an extremely rapid 
and simple manner, to provide a gate that can be associated 
with enclosures and/or the like, and particularly does not 
require, for its construction, welded and/or riveted joints 
or the like. Within the scope of this aim, the main object of the 
invention is to provide a set of modular component elements 
that can be assembled to form a gate, said set being 
marketable as a kit containing all the elements for making 
said gate and can be sold in supermarkets, shops that sell 
DIY items, and so forth, and can be transported in 
disassembled condition on ordinary motor vehicles, so as to  
 
allow anyone to easily erect a gate with standard dimensions 
adaptable to most enclosures currently in use and has a much 
lower cost than conventional gates manufactured by smiths. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
set of connectable modular elements for forming gates and/or 
the like, which allows to build gates that are truly solid 
and rigid so as to withstand even considerable external 
stresses. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
set of connectable modular elements for forming gates and/or 
the like, wherein the individual component elements can be 
produced, like conventional tubular or flat profiled 
elements, at a particularly low cost, by means of existing 
machines and equipment for the production of metal profiled 
elements, metal nets, and/or the like. According to an aspect of the present invention, this 
aim, these objects and others which will become apparent 
hereinafter are achieved by a set of modular component 
elements that can be assembled to form easy-to-assemble 
modular gates and/or the like,
