Method for correcting the shift quality of an automatic 
transmission (2) which is coupled to an engine and in which 

friction elements (14, 15, 17, 18, 19 and 20) can be 
brought into engagement by actuators acting on the pressure 

or oil throughput for the performance of shift operations, 
in which the line pressure applied by the actuators is 

detected by means of an electronic device (1) and corrected 
as a function of different operating parameters, values of 

these operating parameters are measured for each specific 
shift operation and compared in a device with existing 

reference characteristics, wherein in case of inequality 
there is determined a correction factor (KF) which at the 

next identical shift operation leads to an incremental 
increase or decremental decrease of a correction value (K
x
) 
by the correction factor (KF) and therefore correction of 

the line pressure or of the oil throughflow takes place by 
means of the actuators which act on the pressure or oil 

throughput and are driven by the electronic device 
according to the correction value (K
X
), characterised in 
that the first derivative (dR/dt) of the transmission ratio 

(R) is also formed for each specific shift operation as an 
operating parameter in addition to the transmission ratio 

(R) arising, as a function of the time from triggering of 
the shift operation to completion thereof, and assignment 

of values of the transmission ratio (R) to the 

corresponding values of the first derivative (dR/dt) in the 
form of a characteristic curve takes place in the 

electronic device (1), and in that these measured 
characteristic curves are compared with reference 

characteristic curves existing in the device (1) including 
a tolerance range, from which the correction factor (KF) 

results in case of inequality. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
device (1), in case of a correction value |K

is a natural number, issues an indication of an erroneously  

 
proceeding shift operation via a display or an acoustic 

warning device. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that A 
preferably has a value of 3. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
line pressure to be set is calculated in the electronic 

device (1), according to the mathematical relationship:

Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
oil throughput to be set is calculated in the electronic 

device (1), according to the mathematical relationship:

D₂
= variable value for sensitivity adaptation (e.g. 10) 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that at 
each gear change in case of changing up the throttle value 

opening angle (5) is called up and stored in the device (1) 
and the correction values (K
x
) which are determined for this 
specific shift operation are assigned to the throttle valve 

opening angle in the form of a correction table which is 
continuously updated, wherein the updated correction value 

(K

) does not take effect until the immediately following 
identical gear change.  

 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that at 
each gear change in case of changing back the vehicle speed 

is called up and stored in the device (1) and the 
correction values (K
x
) which are determined for this 
specific shift operation are assigned to the vehicle speed 

in the form of a correction table which is continuously 
updated, wherein the updated correction value (K
x
) does not 
take effect until the immediately following identical gear 

change. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
actuators (8, 9) are solenoid valves which are driven 

electrically according to the correction values (K
x
) and the 
resulting mathematical relationships for the pressure P
curr
 
or throughflow Q

factor proportional to these quantities.
