<ABSTRACT>
A number of arrangements and methods that achieve concurrent communication of 
analog information and digital information. In general terms, when the communication 

channel is viewed as a multi-dimensional space, the digital information signal is divided 
into symbols, and the symbols are mapped onto the signal space with a preset distance 

between them. The analog signal, generally limited in magnitude to less than the distance 
separating the symbols, is converted to component signals and added (i.e., vector addition) 

to the symbols. The sum signal is then transmitted to the receiver where the symbols are 
detected and subtracted from the received signal to yield the analog signal components. 

The transmitted analog signal is recreated from those components. Arrangements utilizing 
the above principles are applications where systems that include a digital port can benefit 

from an analog communication channel, and conversely, where systems that include an 
analog port can benefit from a digital communication channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to an application titled SIMULTANEOUS ANALOG 
AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION, filed on even date hereof. This invention relates to simultaneous transmission of analog and digital signals 
and, more particularly, to applications that employ simultaneous transmission of analog 
signals and digital signals in a non-multiplexed manner and in a generally co-extensive 
frequency band. In the prior art, when voice and data is transmitted simultaneously over a channel, 
it is typically transmitted either via frequency-division multiplexing or time-division 
multiplexing. In frequency-division multiplexing, the data channel and the voice channel 
are allocated different sub-bands of the channel's bandwidth. Examples of that are U.S. 
Patent No. 4,757,495, U. S. Patent 4,672,602, and U. S. Patent 4,546,212. In time-division 
multiplexing arrangements, voice signals are sampled, digitized and interleaved 
with digital data to form a single information stream which is communicated over the 
available channel. Practically every digital carrier system (e.g. the T1 carrier system) is an 
example of that. U.S. Patent No. 4,512,013, issued April 16, 1985, presents an interesting approach 
that is close to a frequency division multiplexing arrangement for simultaneous voice and 
data. The arrangement filters the speech signal and adds thereto a modulated narrowband 
signal to form the transmitted signal. The narrowband modulated signal derives from a 
narrowband digital input signal that is modulated with a carrier, thereby shifting the 
narrow-band up in frequency to a position in the spectrum where there is little speech 
energy. At the receiver, in reliance of the fact that the speech power is low in the 
narrowband occupied by the modulated digital signal, the digital signal is recovered 
through appropriate demodulation. Thereafter, the recovered digital signal is remodulated 
to replicate the transmitter's operation, adaptively filtered to account for channel 
characteristics, and subtracted from the received signal. The result is the received speech. 
As indicated above, one salient characteristic of that arrangement, as stated in col. 2, lines  
 
13-18, is that "...an entire analog speech signal and a modulated data signal are capable of 
being transmitted over a normal analog channel by the multiplexing of the data signal 
within the portion of the normal analog speech signal frequency band where the speech 
signal is present and the power density characteristic thereof is low". As an
