<ABSTRACT>
Support structure (10) consisting of a plurality of elements (30) for 
chairs, beds and the like, which may be moved individually or in 

groups, in which the mechanism which performs the movement of the 
generic element (30) downwards and successively upwards is composed by 

an articulated parallelogram (60) having one side (80) integral with 
said element (30), that side (80) presenting a small wheel (170) which is 

in rolling contact with a cam (190) fitted to a shaft (210) supported by 
a lug (220) integral with the frame (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support structure consisting of a
plurality of transversal mobile elements for chairs, beds and the like.
The elements in the support structure move vertically downwards and
successively return upwards to their initial position by means of a cam
mechanism.It is common knowledge that persons who are obliged to sit or lie down
for long periods of time (handicapped people, truck drivers etc.) suffer
from disturbances caused by soreness in the parts of the body which
remain in contact for long periods of time with the support structure
which, in the case of a chair for example, consists of the back rest and
the seat; this prolonged contact, combined with the difficulty of
carrying out movements and with insufficient local blood circulation
often leads to the formation of sores.In the Art, other support structures exist for beds, chairs and the like
shaped as transversal mobile elements.There is for example a support structure for beds or chairs consisting of
a plurality of transversal elements which can be lowered from the resting
plane there being two groups each of which comprises half of these
elements, each group being activated by a complex hydraulic mechanism.
The fact that in this support structure the elements are not independent
from each other but can only be lowered in groups which comprise first
one half of the elements and then the other half of the elements, causes
a periodical doubling of the pressure on the parts of the body which 
periodically come in contact with the elements left in the normal
position. This can be counterproductive from the therapeutic point of
view. Moreover, the elements move away from the plane of support in a
circular trajectory. This means that the upper part of the mobile
elements tends to "drag" across the patient's body. This "dragging"
causes the person discomfort. In another embodiment there is a bed which
facilitates the manipulation of a patient lying down for the treatment of
malformations of the backbone. In accordance with the pre-established
aims, the transversal mobile elements must conform to the patient's
physical features. That is, they must exert sufficient pressure on each
part of the patient's back in order to "manipulate" the backbone
according to the therapy envisaged by the operator. In order to achieve
this, the transversal mobile elements are raised in relation to the
normal resting plane.A cam mechanism is used for raising the elements.A support structure according to the preamble of claim 1 is
known from

<CLAIMS>
A support structure for chairs, beds and the like, comprising:

a plurality of body support elements (30) movable between a normal
position and a lower position, and
a plurality of mechanisms, each associated with each one of said
body support elements (30), for moving said body support element (30)

from said normal position to said lower position and vice versa so to
temporarily cancel the body supporting pressure on a portion of the

body, each of said mechanisms including an articulated parallelogram
structure (60) hingedly connected to a frame (20) and including the

respective body support element (30);
characterised in that

a follower wheel (170)
is connected to said body support element (30), and in that

each of said mechanisms further includes a cam
(190) comprising a disk mounted on-center on a shaft (210) supported

by said frame (20) and including a circular portion and a depression
(200), said follower wheel (170) being engaged with said cam (190);

and
in that,
 during the rotation of said cams (190), each of said body
support elements (30) lowers from and successively returns to said

normal position when the relevant follower wheel (170) travels along
said depression (200) of the relevant cam (190), each of said body

support elements (30) remaining on its normal position when the
relevant follower wheel (170) travels along said circular portions of

the relevant cam (190).
The support structure of claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at least 
one side (110) of each parallelogram structure (60) is stressed by at

least a spring (180).
The support structure of claim 1, 
characterised in that
 each of
said cams (190) is offset in relation to the preceding and subsequent

cam (190) such that said elements (30) are lowered from and
successively brought again to said normal position one after another

or one group after another according to a pre-established sequence.
The support structure of claim 3, 
characterised in that
 said pre-established
sequence is preset using electronic control means.
The support structure of claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said
support structure (10) is used in a back rest of a chair.
The support structure of claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said
support structure (10) is used in a seat of a chair.
The support structure of claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said
support structure (10) is used in a bed.
