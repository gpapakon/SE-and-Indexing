<DESCRIPTION>
 "Sealing device"The present invention relates to a sealing device provided for being applied onto an object to be sealed, said device comprising an electronic component with a memory, which component is connected to a detection loop provided for letting energy circulating through it and to be broken upon breaking said sealing device, said component being further connected to communication means for communicating with reading means.Such a device is known from patent application PCT/US90/0008 . In this device, the communication means is provided in the form of a transmitter or a transmitter/receiver connected to a bus in a control box. The control box is further provided with electronic components and an own power supply, e.g. an alkaline battery, in order to supply energy to the electronic components for recording when the detection loop has been violated and also in order to enable transmission from the communication means towards a central watch station.A drawback of the known device is that is requires necessarily the presence of an own power supply in order to furnish energy to the electronic components and in order to enable transmission from the communication means towards the central watch station.It is an object of the present invention to provide a sealing device which does not require necessarily the presence of an own power supply in order to be operable. 

 To this object, the sealing device according to the invention is characterised in that said communication means comprise a communication loop provided for receiving power for powering up said sealing device. The communication means in the form of a communication loop enables to form a simple and compact sealing device. Since the communication means are provided for receiving power for powering up said sealing device, the sealing device according to the invention may be powered up by an external power supply and consequently does not require necessarily an own power supply.According to a first preferred embodiment, the sealing device according to the invention said communication loop is provided for receiving power from said reading means. This enables to form a sealing device which is only activated when communicating with the reading means.According to a second preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention, said detection loop is connected in parallel with the communication loop. This enables to have an electronic component which is only provided with two connection ports instead of four, for connecting the communication
