<ABSTRACT>
Process for copolymerisation of ethylene in two reactors with a loop in liquid phase in series, in which the average molecular weight is regulated, the introduction of the comonomer is performed in the first reactor and the polymers of high and low molecular weight are produced in the first and the second reactor respectively, the improvement consisting in employing one or more legs for separation from the first reactor for the transfer.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing polyethylene with at most 20% in mols of one or more
alpha-alkenes having 3 to 10 atoms of carbon, in two liquid full loop reactors, connected

in series at a temperature of 50 to 120°C, at an absolute pressure of 1 to 100 bars, in the
presence of a catalyst, with control of the average molecular weight, this process taking

in the fact that the polymerising is done in such a way that the co-monomer is essentially
introduced into the first reactor, that in the first reactor the molecular weight is

controlled to form polymers with a high load melt index [HLMI] between 0.01 and 10

g/10' inclusive, and that the time of being left in the first reactor is adjusted to produce
30 to 70% by weight of the total polymer, while in the second reactor the molecular

weight is controlled to form polymers such that the final polymers have an HLMI
greater than 1 g/10', the improvement consisting in using one or more settling legs of

the first reactor for the transfer.
Process according to Claim 1 in which the contents of the settling leg are
transferred when it is filled with solids at a concentration which is at least 5% by weight

above the concentration of the solids in the first reactor.
Process according to Claim 2 in which the contents of the settling leg are
transferred when it is filled with solids at a concentration which is at least 10% by

weight above the concentration of the solids in the first reactor.
Process according to Claim 3 in which the contents of the settling leg are
transferred when it is filled with solids at a concentration which is at least 20% by

weight above the concentration of the solids in the first reactor.
Process according to any one of the Claims 1 to 4 in which the catalyst consists
of a transition structure metal compound which is the product of the reaction of an

organo-magnesian compound and, optionally, one or more electron donors, the mean
molecular weight being controlled with hydrogen. 
Process according to any one of the Claims 1 to 5 in which the polymerising
temperature is from 50 to 110°C.
Process according to any one of the Claims 1 to 6 in which the polymerising
pressure is 30 to 50 bars.
Process according to any one of the Claims 1 to 7 in which the polymers
formed in the first reactor have an HLMI between 0.01 and 5 g/10', preferably

between 0.1 and 2 g/10'.
Process according to any one of the Claims 1 to 8 in which the final polymers
have an HLMI higher than 5 g/10'.
