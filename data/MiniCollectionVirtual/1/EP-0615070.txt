<ABSTRACT>
In a plant comprising a pump unit for circulating heated 
liquid within the plant, said pump unit comprising a liquid 

pump (1,2,3,5) driven by an electric motor (4,6,7), the 
operating economy is improved by cooling the electric motor 

by circulating a part-flow of the heated liquid circulated 
by the liquid pump in a cooling jacket (8) provided in the 

electric motor (4,6,7). A further improvement is achieved 
by thermally insulating (10) the electric motor (4,6,7) and 

the liquid pump (1,2,3,5) from the surroundings, so that 
the heat losses from the electrical components are utilized 

for heating the liquid being circulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plant with a pump unit 
for circulating heated liquid within the plant, said pump 
unit comprising a liquid pump and an electric motor driving 
the liquid pump. In plants of this type, e.g. a central-heating plant, circulating 
pumps of the so-called wet-rotor type are conventionally 
used, said pumps being cooled in part by the circulating 
liquid in the region between the rotor and the 
stator, in part by the ambient air in the region around the 
motor housing. Alternatively and especially in connection 
with larger pumps, a motor with a dry-running rotor is used, 
the motor being air-cooled, this cooling conventionally 
being augmented by a blower rotor mounted on the motor shaft. Both these types of circulating pumps dissipate a substantial 
amount of heat to the surroundings, thus constituting a 
source of undesired heating of the space, in which they are 
situated. The dissipated heat comes in part from the motor 
losses, in part from the heated liquid being circulated. Normally, no provision is made for insulating such circulating 
pumps, as it is necessary for the motor to give off 
heat to the surrounding air in order to prevent it from 
becoming too hot. Besides, it is usually difficult and 
time-consuming to perform maintenance and inspection work 
on a thermally insulated pump unit.  
 EP-A-0 467 282 describes a pump unit, which is cooled by 
circulating a part-flow of the pumped liquid in a cooling 
jacket. The pumped liquid is mentioned as being waste water 
or sludge. Accordingly there is no intentional heating of 
this liquid and the temperature can be expected to be in 
the range 5-15Â°C. This document does not mention anything 
about recovery of heat or preservation of energy. 
The only object of this document is to cool the motor and 
to remove air from the cooling jacket. US-A-4 854 373 discloses a pump unit for circulating heated 
liquid. The motor is partially cooled by circulating a part-flow 
of the circulated liquid in a separate externally mounted 
cooling jacket covering approximately one half of the 
surface of the motor. Since the flow of the liquid in the 
cooling jacket can be controlled, the motor has to be cooled 
in an alternative way, when this control reduces the cooling 
via the cooling jacket. This part of the cooling represents 
loss of energy to the surroundings. DE-A-31 09 624 describes thermally insulation of a pump 
unit with the purpose of transporting the heated water with 
minimum heat loss. This document does not mention
