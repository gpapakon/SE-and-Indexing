<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
display apparatus such as an active matrix driving
liquid crystal display apparatus.As an image display apparatus, a display
apparatus employing an active matrix driving mechanism
has been known. This image display apparatus includes
a plurality of scanning signal lines and a plurality of
data signal lines. Each of the scanning signal lines
intersects respective data signal lines. Pixels are
provided in the portions surrounded by two adjacent
scanning signal lines and two adjacent data signal
lines, and are arranged into a matrix pattern.In the case of a liquid crystal display for
instance, as shown in Figure 23, each pixel Z comprises
a transistor TR such as a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) or
an FET as a driving element, a pixel capacitor CP, and
an storage capacitor Cs which is added as necessary.
As shown in this figure, a data signal line 101 is
connected to one of the electrodes of the pixel capacitor
Cp through the drain and source of the transistor
TR. The gate of the transistor TR is connected to a
scanning signal line 102, and the other electrode of
the pixel capacitor Cp (common electrode) is connected
to a common power source line (not shown).The scanning signal lines 102 are connected
to a scanning driver 104 which outputs a scanning 
signal. The data signal lines 101 are connected to a
data driver 103 which samples an image signal and
transfers it to the data signal lines 101 as a display
data signal. The data driver 103 outputs a display
data signal to the data scanning lines 101 for every
scanning signal line 102 or for every pixel Z. The
transistor TR is turned on when the scanning signal
line 102 is activated, and then, the display data
transferred on the data signal line 101 is written in
the pixel capacitor Cp and the storage capacitor Cs.A display at the pixel Z is maintained by the
electric charge written in the pixel capacitors Cp and
the storage capacitor Cs. An alternating current drive
(inversion driving) is required to prevent the deterioration
of the pixel capacitor Cp, or of the liquid
crystal. When the alternating current drive is performed
by a frame cycle, flickers of 30 Hz or 25 Hz are
apparent though it may be different depending on the
field frequencies (or frame frequencies) of the signals.
Therefore, it is common to perform a inversion
driving, a so-called "frame + 1H line", in which the
polarity of an electric charge supplied to the pixel
capacitor is inverted by every horizontal scanning in
addition to the frame inversion.In
