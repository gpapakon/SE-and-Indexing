<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical cables for use
in optical transmission systems, and especially to
cables for use in overhead optical transmission systems
in which the cable is supported along the route of the
system by means of towers, masts or other upstanding
supports that are also employed to support electrical
power cables.In systems of this kind it is the general practice
to earth the optical cable or cables at the towers,
masts or other supports (hereinafter simply referred to
as towers). When the electrical power lines are on
load, electrical currents may be capacitively induced on
the optical cable due to the distributed capacitance
between the cable and the power lines. The voltage
induced on the optical cable will reach a maximum at mid
span between the towers, while the current flowing along
the cable will be greatest in the region of the towers.
Under dry conditions the induced currents will be
relatively small due to the relatively high longitudinal 
resistance of the cable, e.g. in the region of 1012 Ohm
m-1 but under wet conditions when the surface resistance
of the cable is much lower, e.g. in the region of 10M
Ohm m-1, much higher currents will be induced. Joule
heating of the cable surface by the induced currents can
cause a short length of the cable surface to become dry,
usually in the region of a tower where the current is
highest. When this happens the major part of the
induced voltage on the cable is dropped across the short
dry band due to its high longitudinal resistance, and so
called "dry-band arcing" may occur which can cause
severe damage to the cable.It is possible to overcome the problem of dry-band
arcing by providing the optical cable with a
longitudinally extruding electrically conductive path.
However, an optical cable having such a longitudinally
continuous electrically conductive path has the
disadvantage that it cannot be installed safely between
towers of an overhead electric power transmissions line
that is on load in view of the danger of it touching one
of the transmission lines; moreover, it is not always
possible or desirable to interrupt the electrical power
transmitted by the overhead electric power transmission
line for a time sufficient to enable such an optical
cable to be installed.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an improved method of installing in an overhead 
power transmission line which is on load an optical
cable which has an overall protective sheath of
electrically insulating material and which has,
extending throughout

<CLAIMS>
A method of installing an optical cable in an
overhead power transmission line which comprises

supporting an optical cable, which has an overall
protective sheath of electrically insulating material,

in long lengths between towers employed to support at
le
ast one electric power transmission line which is on
load and, after the optical cable has been so installed

and while the overhead electric power transmission line
is on load, providing on or in the supported optical

cable at least one longitudinally continuous path which
extends throughout substantially the whole length of the

supported optical cable and which is sufficiently
electrically conductive to carry along the cable any

currents that may be capacitively induced.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
optical cable is suspended at at least one position

intermediate of its ends by a tower employed to support
the overhead electric power line.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
the electrically conductive path on the or each optical

cable is directly or indirectly connected to
the or each tower.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the electrically conductive path is provided by

winding an electrically conductive flexible element
helically around the optical cable. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
electrically conductive flexible element comprises a

flexible tube in which is loosely housed throughout its
length a wire of metal or metal alloy or of carbon or

carbon-based composite, the wire having an overall
length greater than that of the tube.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein a flexible element of a metal or metal alloy is

accommodated throughout the length of at least one
longitudinally continuous bore or other passage within

the cable by introducing a leading end of the length of
flexible element into an end of the bore or other

passage and by propelling the flexible element along the
bore or other passage by fluid drag of a gaseous medium

which is passed through the bore or passage in the
desired direction of advance at such a pressure that the

length of flexible element is carried along the bore or
passage until the length of flexible element is loosely

housed in and throughout the length of said bore or
passage of the supported cable.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the electrically conductive path comprises an

extruded length of an elastomer around which one or more
elongate conductors have been wound.
A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein a
plurality of elongate conductors have been braided on to

the extruded length of elastomer.
