<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an apparatus (10) for activation of a digesting agent for an organic material, the apparatus (10) comprising a tank (14); means for activating the digesting agent in the tank (14); and means for enabling the activated digesting agent to contact the organic material. The activating means is preferably a heating element (26). The enabling means is preferably an exit pipe (34). The invention has particular application in the preventative maintenance of a drainage system (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
activation of a digesting agent. The invention has 
application for the complete or partial bio-degradation 
of an organic material. The term "organic material" as used herein is 
intended to embrace excrement from humans and other 
animals, and waste from kitchens (for example, kitchens 
of restaurants, hotels, public houses, hospitals and 
schools); bathrooms; meat and poultry processing plants; 
slaughterhouses; and plants from the pulping, food 
processing, wool scouring, rendering, tanning and 
fermentation industries and the like. The invention has particular application in the 
preventative maintenance of a drainage system, so as to 
inhibit the formation of grease/sludge blockages 
therein. A drainage system typically comprises a downpipe 
communicating with a U-shaped trap which in turn communicates 
with a substantially horizontal pipe leading into 
a grease trap downstream of which is either a septic 
tank or a mains waste outlet. Grease, oils and fats are used extensively in food 
preparation and cooking. Whilst warm, they are free-flowing 
but as they cool down, they start to  
 
solidify causing obstruction or blockage of drainage 
systems. It is known to incorporate a grease trap in a 
drainage system to separate grease from the waste waters 
by making use of the ability of grease globules to float 
on water. Such a grease trap has a deflector disposed 
adjacent a waste inlet and a baffle disposed adjacent a 
waste outlet. The deflector and the baffle partially 
define a central chamber. Such a grease trap reduces 
the speed of incoming waste water using the deflector 
and the grease globules then rise into the central 
chamber of the grease trap to form a grease layer in the 
central chamber. The water underneath the grease layer 
is forced out of the grease trap under the baffle by the 
incoming waste water. The grease trap is provided with 
an opening to permit removal of the grease layer trapped 
in the central chamber at regular intervals. Digesting agents may be used wherever organic 
material is present, including bathroom maintenance; 
odour control and surface cleaning; laundry 
pre-spotting; garbage disposal; trap and drain 
maintenance; carpet and fabric care; waste water 
systems; porta-toilets and roller vehicle (mobile homes, 
caravans, campers and the like) applications; and 
cattle, pig and animal shelters and feed lots. Specifically, various digesting agents have been 
developed to digest grease and sludge (protein, starch

A method for increasing the rate of multiplication of a 
micro-organism in a digesting agent from a dormant state 

in a dormant digesting agent comprising bacterial spores 
and enzymes to an increased multiplication state in an 

activated digesting agent before the activated digesting 
agent contacts organic material in a drainage system 

(38), the method comprising introducing a charge of a 
dormant digesting agent from a container (12;112) 

housing a plurality of charges of dormant digesting 
agent into a tank (14;114); heating the charge of 

dormant digesting agent in the tank (14;114) for 30-60 
minutes at 35-43째C so that the rate of multiplication of 

the micro-organism in the digesting agent is increased 
from the dormant state of the dormant digesting agent to 

the increased multiplication state of the activated 
digesting agent; and introducing a charge of the 

activated digesting agent from the tank (14;114) into 
the draining system (38). 
A method according to claim 1, in which the charge 
of dormant digesting agent is heated in the tank 

(14;114) for 40 minutes. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
charge of dormant digesting agent is heated to 36-38째C. 
Use of an apparatus (10;110) for increasing the rate 
of multiplication of a micro-organism in a digesting 

agent from a dormant state in a dormant digesting agent 
comprising bacterial spores and enzymes to an increased 

multiplication state in an activated digesting agent 
before the activated digesting agent contacts organic 

material in a drainage system (38), the apparatus 
(10;110) comprising a container (12;112) for housing a  

 
plurality of charges of dormant digesting agent; a tank 

(14;114); a pipe (16;116) in fluid communication between 
the container (12;112) and the tank (14;114); first 

regulating means (18;60;58,56) in operative association 
with the pipe (16;116) for introducing a charge of the 

dormant digesting agent from the container (12;112) 
into the tank (14;114); a heating element (26;126) in 

operative association with the tank (14;114) for 
thermally increasing the rate of multiplication of the 

micro-organism in the digesting agent in the tank 
(14;114) by heating for 30-60 minutes at 35-43째C; exit 

means (34;134) in fluid communication between the tank 
(14;114) and the drainage system (38); and second 

regulating means (32;132) in operative association with 
the exit means (34;134) for introducing a charge of the 

activated digesting agent into the drainage system (38) 
so that, in use, the activated digesting agent exits the 

apparatus (10;110) and then contacts the drainage system 
(38). 
Use according to claim 4, in which the charge of 
dormant digesting agent is heated in the tank (14;114) 

for 40 minutes. 
Use according to claim 4 or 5, in which the charge 
of dormant digesting agent is heated to 36-38째C.
