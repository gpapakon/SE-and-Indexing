<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle tyre, in particular for use in winter driving conditions. The tread is provided with profile blocks which have a number of fine indents. The fine indents (2, 2', 2'', 12, 22) start from a central area of the profile block (1, 11, 21, 32, 42) extending in a beam-like configuration to the edges of the profile block.

Vehicle tyre, more especially for use in wintry 
travel conditions, having a tread strip profile which 

includes profile blocks (1, 11, 21, 32, 42) which are each 
provided with a plurality of fine incisions (2, 2', 2''; 12, 

22) which extend radially from the central region of the 
respective profile block (1, 11, 21, 32, 42) to the 

profile block edges, characterised in that the central 
region is solid and is, in consequence, free of any 

profilings, at least two of the fine incisions (2a) 
extending at least substantially in the circumferential 

direction from the central region in opposite directions, 
and each of the fine incisions (2, 2', 2''; 12, 22) at least 

substantially retaining its basic extension direction over 
its entire length. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the fine incisions (2, 2', 2''; 12, 22) are configured 

as rectilinear, undulatory or zigzag-shaped fine incisions 
when viewed from above. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that, when viewed from above, the 

radially extending fine incisions (22) have a slightly 
curved configuration, more especially all of the fine 

incisions (22), which extend internally of a profile block 
(21), being curved in the same direction. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the number of the fine incisions (2, 

2', 2''; 12, 22), which extend radially in the profile block 
(1, 11, 21, 32, 42), is at least 4, more especially between 

8 and 12. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that two fine incisions (12) at a time,  

 
which lie opposite each other in respect of the central 

region, are interconnectable by a straight line, these 
straight lines having a common intersection in the centre 

of the profile block (1). 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the fine incision ends in the central 

region of the profile block (1, 11, 21, 32, 42) have a 
minimum spacing of two millimetres therebetween. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the radially extending fine incisions 

(2, 12, 22) in the profile block (1, 11, 21) are 
distributed at least substantially uniformly. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the radially extending fine incisions 

(2') are disposed and distributed in the profile block (32) 
in such a manner that the sum of all of the length 

components of the fine incisions (2') which are projectable 
in the axial direction corresponds to at least 1.5-times, 

preferably 2- to 3-times, the sum of all of the length 
components which are projectable in the circumferential 

direction.
