<ABSTRACT>
A pushnut fastener (10) for engagement on a cylindrical stud (40) and particularly suited for conveying to the point of use through automatic feed systems comprises a metal body (12) of relatively thin, uniform thickness having oppositely facing first and second exterior surfaces (14 and 16) and a circular radial outer marginal periphery. A central opening extends axially through the body between the oppositely facing exterior surfaces and defines a generally circular inner marginal periphery having resilient finger-like engagement portions (26) for engaging and gripping the exterior of the cylindrical stud. The finger-like engagement portions (26) are inclined to extend laterally of the body outwardly of the first exterior surface (14) a maximum distance of d. A circumferentially continuous cylindrical peripheral flange (18) is formed on the radial outer marginal periphery to extend generally perpendicular to the first exterior surface (14) and terminate in a continuous free end which lies entirely in a plane parallel to the first exterior surface outwardly thereof a distance D which is substantially greater than d. The outer free end is smooth and radiused on the radial inner edge (22). A relatively large transition radius (20) extends completely about the radial outer marginal periphery between the second face and the circumferentially continuous peripheral flange.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PUSH-ON TYPE FASTENER FOR AUTOMATIC FEED AND INSTALLATION EQUIPMENTBackground of the InventionThe subject invention is directed to a push-on type metal fastener which can be axially forced into engaged position on cylindrical rods or studs.The invention is especially suited for forming push-on fasteners that can be fed to the point of use through flexible feed tubes and applied using automatic applicator tools and will be described with reference thereof; however, as will become apparent, fasteners of the invention can equally well be transferred and applied manually.Push-on type fasteners are well known and widely used for securing and joining various components to unthreaded studs and rods. Normally, the fasteners are transferred and installed using simple manually manipulated tools. The design of the prior fasteners is such that the fasteners cannot be readily fed and applied using automatic orienting, conveying, and installing equipment.Brief statement of the InventionThe subject invention provides a fastener of the push-on type which is efficient and strong and which has a configuration that is especially suited for use in automatic feed systems. The design is such that the fasteners can be oriented in conventional vibratory bowl orienting equipment. In addition, the exterior configuration and surface design of the fasteners allows them to be freely moved through extruded flexible conveying tubes by blowing them therethrough using pressurized air. 

 In accordance with the subject invention, there is provided a pushnut fastener which is intended for engagement on a cylindrical stud and is particularly suited for being conveyed to the point of use through automatic feed systems. According to the preferred form of the invention, the pushnut comprises a metal body of relatively thin, uniform thickness having oppositely facing first and second exterior surfaces and a circular, radial outer marginal periphery. A central opening extends axially through the body between the oppositely facing exterior surfaces. The central opening defines a generally circular inner marginal periphery having resilient finger-like engagement portions for engaging and gripping the exterior of a cylindrical stud. The finger-like engagement portions are inclined to extend laterally of the body outwardly of the first exterior surface a maximum distance of d. A circumferentially continuous cylindrical peripheral flange is formed on the radial outer marginal periphery to extend generally perpendicular to the first exterior

<CLAIMS>
Having thus described the invention, it is claimed:
1. A pushnut fastener for engagement on a cylindrical stud and particularly suited for conveying to the point of use through automatic feed systems, the pushnut comprising: a metal body of relatively thin, uniform thickness having oppositely facing first and second exterior surfaces and a circular radial outer marginal periphery; a central opening extending axially through the body between the oppositely facing exterior surfaces and defining a generally circular inner marginal periphery having resilient finger-like engagement portions for engaging and gripping the exterior of the cylindrical stud, the finger-like engagement portions being inclined to extend laterally of the body outwardly of the first exterior surface a maximum distance of d; a circumferentially continuous cylindrical peripheral flange formed on the radial outer marginal periphery extending generally perpendicular to the first exterior surface and terminating in a continuous free end which lies entirely in a plane parallel to the first exterior surface outwardly thereof a distance D which is substantially greater than d, the outer free end being smooth and being radiused on the radial inner edge thereof; and, a relatively large transition radius completely about the radial outer marginal periphery joining between the second face and the circumferentially continuous peripheral flange.
2. The pushnut fastener as defined in claim 1 wherein the continuous peripheral flange has a radial outer surface which is generally perpendicular to the second exterior surface and joined therewith by the large 


transition radius with the axial outer surface of the continuous peripheral flange being a surface resulting from a shearing operation used during the forming of the pushnut fastener.
3. The pushnut fastener as defined in claim 1 wherein the diameter of the outer marginal periphery is greater than the height of the continuous peripheral flange.
4. The pushnut fastener as defined in claim 1 wherein the size of the transition radius joining between the second face and the circumferentially continuous peripheral flange is a plurality of times greater than the size of the radius on the radial inner edge of the free end of the peripheral flange.
5. The pushnut fastener as defined in claim 4 wherein the size of the radius on the radial inner edge of the peripheral flange is nearly equal to the radial thickness of the peripheral flange.
6. The pushnut fastener as defined in claim 5 wherein the continuous peripheral flange has a radial outer surface which is generally perpendicular to the second exterior surface, at least the axial outermost end portion of the radial outer surface being a cut surface resulting from a shearing operation used during forming of the pushnut fastener.
7. The pushnut fastener as defined in claim 6 wherein the cut surface is continuous about the flange and has an axial length substantially equal to the radial thickness of the peripheral flange.
