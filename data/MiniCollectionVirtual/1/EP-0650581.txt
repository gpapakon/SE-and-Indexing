<ABSTRACT>
A gas meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms work back-and-forth in chambers to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted is adapted for a variety of different mounting configurations by the selection of appropriate top and bottom covers (30', 33'). In the configuration shown in the figure, the bottom cover is a blank plate, while top cover (33') provides spaced apart inlet (72) and outlet (71). Top cover (33') is internally divided to provide separate paths for inlet and outlet gas. In another configuration, the top cover provides only an outlet connection, while the bottom cover has an inlet connection and there are internal gasways in the meter leading the gas up from the inlet connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BODY AND EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS OF A DRY GAS METERThis invention relates to a dry gas meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms work back-and-forth in chambers to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted. It is desired that meters of the kind described should be made adaptable to different mounting configurations, so that they may be used to replace meters in existing installations.The invention provides a dry gas meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms work back-and-forth in chambers to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted and which has a unitary core providing in one piece the structure for the inner sides of two chambers, characterized by said unitary core also providing internal gasways and by first and second covers secured to the upper and lower sides of the unitary core and providing inlet and outlet connections for connecting the meter into a gas line and by their configuration determining the path taken by gas flowing through the meter.By selecting appropriate first and second covers the meter may in a first mode be adapted for an in-line gas flow from an inlet boss in the second, lower, cover to an outlet boss in the first, upper, cover. In this adaptation, the outlet boss is connected to an exhaust tube connected to the two chambers and the inlet boss directs gas flow through the said gasways into the said first housing.In a second mode, the meter connections may be altered to inlet and outlet bosses spaced apart in the first, upper, cover, the second, lower, cover effectively blanking off the said second housing. Thus the gas path does not include said gasways. The said first, upper, cover in this mode is constructed with direct access from the inlet boss to the first housing but with an internal passageway leading fran the outlet boss to the exhaust tube. By the simple provision of appropriate upper and lower covers the meter can be adapted to meet a variety of different connection conÂ¬ figurations, so that it can be used for in-line connections and for replacement of meters having horizontally spaced-apart connections. It should be noted that the majority of the meter is not affected by such adaptation so that virtually the same design of meter can be used 

for a number of different applications simply by the use of appropriate covers.The invention extends to the provision of a meter which can by the selection of simple and appropriate covers be adapted to different connection configurations. It also extends to the provision

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS:
1. A dry gas meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms (13) work back-and-forth in chambers (11, 12) to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted and which has a unitary core (15) providing in one piece the structure for the inner sides of two chambers (11, 12), characterized by said unitary core (15) also providing internal gasways (21, 22, 51) and by first and second covers (30, 33, 30', 33') secured to the upper and lower sides of the unitary core (15) and providing inlet and outlet connections (31, 34' , 71, 72) for connecting the meter into a gas line and by their configuration determining the path taken by gas flowing through the meter.
2. A meter as claimed in claim 1, further characterized by said unitary core (15) also providing the structure for a first housing (23) located above the two chambers and a second housing (20) located below the two chambers, said housings being closed by said first and second covers respectively, two of said gasways (21, 22) connecting the second housing to the first housing, whereby when in one configuration the second cover (30) has an inlet connection gas is led therefrom to the interior of the first housing, but in a second configuration when the second cover (30') has no gas inlet the gasways (21, 22) are inoperative.
3. A meter as claimed in claim 2, further characterized by said first cover (33) in said one configuration having an outlet connection arranged to be secured to an exhaust tube (36) which passes through said first housing, and in said second configuration said first cover (33') having both inlet and outlet connections and an internal division so that a separate gas path from the inlet connection to housing (23) is provided.
4. A dry gas meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms (13) work back-and-forth in chambers (11, 12) to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted, characterized by being adapted for attachment to a variety of gas line connections, including in-line connections and spaced-apart connections, by the selection of appropriate upper and lower covers (30, 33, 30', 33'). 


5. A gas meter as claimed in claim 4, further characterized by said adaptation comprising the provision of first and second housings (23, 20) at the upper and lower sides of the meter and to which said covers (30, 33, 30', 33') are secured and internal gasways (21, 22) connecting the two housing together.
