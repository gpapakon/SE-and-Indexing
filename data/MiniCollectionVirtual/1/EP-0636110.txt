<ABSTRACT>
The chlorine content in chlorinated hydrocarbons in an environment which admits the presence of air and moisture can be reduced by bringing the chlorinated hydrocarbon into contact wih a dechlorination reagent which comprises (i) a complex of a substantially nontoxic metal having at least two oxidation states and (ii) a reducing agent which reductively returns the complex from its second oxidation step to its first oxidation stage. A representative embodiment involves bis-( eta

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR DECREASING CHLORINE CONTENT OF CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS'_ This invention pertains to a process for decreasing the l 5 content of chlorine in chlorinated hydrocarbons.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVarious chlorinated hydrocarbons such as polychlori- nated biphenyls, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, polychlorinated naphthalene, chlo-10 rine containing fluorocarbons ("Freons") , polychlorinated cyclodienes such as aldrin and dieldrin, polychlorinated bicycloalkanes such as mirex etc. , are recognized environ¬ mental contaminants. Numerous chemical, physical, and microbiological methods for eliminating these presently are15 under investigation. While microbiological techniques are useful in bioremediation of many contaminants, such tech¬ niques have not proven satisfactory for highly chlorinated products such as those containing four or more chlorine atoms; see e. g. , Hill et al . , Appl . Biochem. Biotechnol . ,20 20/21, 233 (1989) and Waid, "PCBs and the Environment , " Vol. II, 78, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida.Various chemical approaches have been investigated but again it appears the greater the number of chlorine atoms in a target contaminant, the more difficult the dechlorination. 25 Moreover systems which appear to be useful in the controlled environment of the laboratory encounter unexpected difficul¬ ties when an attempt is made to adapt the system to the com¬ petitive and ambient environment where such highly chlori¬ nated products pose the greatest problem.30 Wilwerding, U.S. Patent No. 4,931,167, describes the* degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls in a non-aqueous 

medium using anhydrous metal halides such as the chlorides and bromides of aluminum, titanium, tin, iron, etc.Imamura et al. , U.S. Patent No. 4,957,717, describe the disposal of organic compounds by burning them in contact with a catalyst of a composite oxides such as titanium-sili¬ con composite oxides and titanium-silicon-zirconium compos¬ ite oxides.Anderson et al. , U.S. Patent No. 5,035,784, describe degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls by photocatalysis by ultraviolet light utilizing porous titanium ceramic mem¬ branes.Meunier, J. Organometal . Chem, 204 (1981) , 345-346 describes the selective reduction of aromatic iodides with sodium borohydride activated by a catalytic amount of bis- (r. -cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride or η -cyclopentadi- enyltitanium trichloride in dimethylformamide and in the presence of air. Aromatic chlorine atoms were not affected.Kozloski, J.
