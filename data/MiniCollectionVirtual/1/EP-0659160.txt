<ABSTRACT>
In order to minimize the space required for a storage system for storing and issuing large-volume items like containers, it is proposed that there be a plurality of storage levels (1, 2, 3) consisting of mutually parallel, individually operable, endless horizontal conveyors (4) with stocking points (8) for the stored items (9). Transversely to the horizontal conveyors (4) on each level run conveyors (13) which may, for instance, also take the form of endless transport devices. This arrangement permits the use of the storage space to the best possible advantage without intermediate spaces for passageways.

Warehousing system for storage and retrieval, particularly 
of large-volume stored goods (9), such as containers and 

the like, with at least one, but preferably several, storage 
levels (1, 2, 3), consisting of individually operable, 

endlessly circulating horizontal conveyors (4) which 
run parallel to one another and have storage locations (8) 

for the stored goods (9), where the front (5) and rear (6) 
ends are roughly aligned with one another and each storage 

level (1, 2, 3) is assigned at least two transport devices 
(13) for the stored goods (9) which are mounted transversely 

to the longitudinal length, or the direction of 
travel, of the horizontal conveyors (4), where one of the 

transport devices is mounted in front of the front end 
(5), and the other behind the rear end (6) of the horizontal 

conveyors (4), and where the transport devices (13) 
transport the stored goods (9) transversely relative to 

the horizontal conveyors (4) and can individually retrieve 
goods from the horizontal conveyors (4), or transfer goods 

to them and where devices for loading and unloading of the 
transport devices (13) are provided, 
characterised 
in that
 each horizontal conveyor (4) can 
be operated in both of their respective longitudinal directions. 
Warehousing system as per Claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 lifting devices are provided for 
loading and unloading the transport devices (13). 
Warehousing system as per Claim 2
, characterised 
in that
 the lifting devices are designed 
as straddle lifts, whose lifting height between the top  

 
(3) and bottom (1) storage levels is variable. 
Warehousing system as per Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised 
in that
 several lifting devices are 
provided for loading the transport devices (13) where each 

lifting device is assigned to several vertically arranged 
horizontal conveyors (4). 
Warehousing system as per one of the Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 sensors are 
provided at the stored goods entry and discharge areas in 

order to record and identify the individual stored goods 
(9). 
Warehousing system as per Claim 5, 
characterised 
in that
 the sensors are linked to a computer 
for warehouse management and control. 
Warehousing system as per one of the Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the arrangement 
of the stored goods (9) in the warehouse corresponds to 

that of a so-called chaotic warehousing system. 
Warehousing system as per one of the Claims 1 to 7, 

characterised in that
, for inward and 
outward transport, the stored goods (9) are arranged on 

transport cars (16) which are respectively interconnected 
at equal distances, where the grid dimensions of the 

transport cars (16), or their spacing, largely correspond 
to the grid dimensions of the adjacently positioned horizontal 

conveyors (4).
