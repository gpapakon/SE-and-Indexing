<ABSTRACT>
A novel pre-processing filter apparatus for use in an 
image encoding system, capable of adaptively filtering an 

input digital video signal, comprises a circuit for delaying 
a current frame of the input digital video signal by one frame 

interval; a circuit for generating a difference signal 
representing the difference between averaged pixel value for 

NxN pixels of the delayed previous frame and an averaged pixel 
value for NxN pixels of the current frame, at an identical 

area of the previous frame and the current frame; two or more 
filtering circuits arranged in parallel for filtering the 

input digital video signal, respectively, each of said 
filtering means having different cutoff frequencies; and a 

control circuit for generating one of the filtered digital 
video signals in response to the difference signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter apparatus; and, 
more particularly, to an improved pre-processing filter 
apparatus for use in an image encoding system, for adaptively 
filtering an input digital video signal based on the 
difference of pixel values between two successive frames. In various electronic applications such as high 
definition television and video telephone systems, an image 
encoding system has been used to reduce a large volume of data 
defining each frame of a digital video signal by way of 
employing various data compression techniques, for example, 
transform coding using Discrete Cosine Transform, and motion 
compensation coding based on temporal relationship between a 
previous and a current frames. In order to effectively carry out the data compression 
process and improve the picture quality, most real-time image 
encoding systems available in the art employ various pre-processing 
filter apparatus. These filter apparatus serve to 
eliminate or alleviate temporal noises and perform band  
 
limitation to thereby improve the picture quality and coding 
efficiency. One of such prior art apparatus is disclosed in an 
article by Andria Wong et al., "MCPIC: A Video Coding 
Algorithm for Transmission and Storage Applications", IEEE 
Communications Magazine, pp.24-32(November,1990), which 
selectively generates either original data, linearly filtered 
data, or a weighted sum of the original data and the linearly 
filtered data based on the absolute value of the difference 
between the original data and the linearly filtered data. 
This filter can reduce aliasing effects and noises and improve 
the image quality significantly. The filtering device, 
however, may introduce artifacts in those areas where motions 
occur in relatively high speeds. U.S. Patent No. 5,231,484 issued to Cesar A. Gonzales et 
al. offers another prior art apparatus which employs a set of 
median filters for adaptively providing filtered data based on 
quantization levels of previously coded frames in order to 
meet a certain target bit rate. Since, however, this filter performs filtering of a 
current frame based on the quantization levels of previously 
coded frames, the filtered data therefrom may not be able to 
reflect the details of the current frame.  It is, therefore, a primary object of the invention to 
provide a pre-processing filter apparatus for use in an image 
encoding system, capable of adaptively filtering an input 
digital video signal based on the difference of pixel values 
between two
