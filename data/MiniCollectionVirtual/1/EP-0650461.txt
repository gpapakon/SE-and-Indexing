<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to beverage dispensers and in particular to a postmix tea 
dispenser. A wide variety of postmix beverage dispensers are known, including a housing, a 
dispensing valve for controlling the ratio of the water and concentrate, a spout on the valve, 
and a drip tray/cup support below the spout. The dispenser of the present invention, in the preferred embodiment, has the 
appearance of a stainless steel brewed tea dispenser and includes inside the urn a postmix 
beverage dispensing valve, such as that shown in U.S. Patent 4,741,355. Water and tea 
concentrate conduits feed water and concentrate, respectively, to the valve from the local 
water supply and from a tea concentrate container located outside the tea urn. The dispensing 
valve controls the ratio of water to concentrate, as is well-known in the postmix beverage 
dispenser field. A handle is attached to the front of the tea urn to operate the dispensing 
valve. The handle body includes a nozzle extender connected to the nozzle of the dispensing 
valve. The present invention will be more fully understood from the detailed 
description below when read in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein like 
reference numerals refer to like elements and wherein: 
Fig. 1 is a front, top, left side perspective view of the dispenser of this invention; Fig. 2 is a partly broken-away, partly exploded perspective view of the dispenser of 
Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is an exploded, perspective view of the handle body and nozzle extender used 
in the dispenser of Fig. 1; Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view through the handle body and nozzle extender of 
Fig. 3; Fig. 5 is a partial cross-sectional view through a portion of a handle body and 
nozzle extender showing the preferred switch actuator assembly of the present invention; 
and Fig. 6 is an enlarged, partial, exploded perspective view of part of the switch 
actuator assembly of Fig. 5. With reference now to the drawings, Figs. 1-6 show the postmix beverage dispenser 
10 of the present invention, having the appearance of a stainless steel iced tea urn. The 
dispenser 10 includes a hollow housing 12, a postmix beverage dispensing valve 14 
mounted inside the housing and a handle body 16 with a handle 18 and dispensing spout 20 
mounted on the outside front of the housing 12. The housing 12 preferably includes a stainless steel cylinder 22 mounted on a base 
24 having a drip tray/cup support 26 below the spout 20. The housing also includes a 
removable cover or lid 28 with a knob. The housing also

<CLAIMS>
A postmix beverage dispenser comprising: 

(a) a hollow housing (12); 
(b) a postmix beverage dispensing valve (14) mounted completely inside of 
said housing and including an on-off switch (42) for operating said valve and having a valve 

nozzle (80); 
(c) a water line (32) and a concentrate line (34) connected to said dispensing 
valve; 
(d) a handle body (16) connected to said housing and having an inner portion 
inside of said housing and an outer portion outside of said housing; 
(e) a handle (18) connected to said outer portion of said body and movable 
between an off-position and an on-position; 
(f) switch actuating means (86) inside of said body responsive to movement 
of said handle for energizing said valve on-off switch; 
(g) a dispensing nozzle (20) connected to said body; and 
(h) a nozzle extender (44) including a water conduit (74) and a concentrate conduit (76) 
therein and located inside of said body and connected at a proximal end thereof to said 

valve nozzle and at a distal end thereof to said dispensing nozzle. 
The dispenser as recited in claim 1 wherein said housing is a vertically 
extending metallic cylinder (22) having a round lid (28) with a knob. 
The dispenser as recited in claim 1 wherein said handle body is removably 
connected to said housing. 
The dispenser as recited in claim 1 including a base (24) on which said housing is 
mounted and said base including a drip tray (26) below said dispensing nozzle. 
The dispenser as recited in claim 1 wherein said housing includes an opening (46) 
for receiving said inner portion and said body (16) having a flange (54) with an annular groove (53) for 

receiving an edge of said housing defining said opening, when said body is inserted into 
said opening and rotated, and a retainer (56) for holding said body to said housing. 
The dispenser as recited in claim 1 wherein said switch actuating means 
includes a cam element (104) and means for moving said cam element to energize said valve 

on-off switch both when said handle is pulled down and when it is pushed up.
