<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a meat-based food product, in which lean beef and/or pork, in a first step, is preminced in a mincer and is then finely chopped in a cutter and the protein broken down, with cooling by addition of chopped ice or snow and in which, moreover, fatty pork is added to produce a fine meat emulsion. By the process according to the invention, the fine meat emulsion thus produced is charged into moulds, then scalded with steam in the cooking cabinet at approximately 70@ to 75@C and the mass obtained is then cut into small pieces after cooling, preferably into rod-like strips. These rod-like strips, in a following step, are deep-fried in boiling fat for a relatively short period. A meat-based food product is thus obtained which is dimensionally stable without use of a casing and at the same time can be kept for a relatively long period, this food product being produced without the use of preservatives and protein substitutes.

Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat in which
in a first step lean beef and/or pork is pre-minced in a mincing machine

and then finely minced in a cutter, the albumen is disintegrated
under being cooled by adding crushed ice or snow and in which additionally

fat pork is added in order to produce a fine sausage meat,
characterised in that the fine sausage meat produced in this manner

is portioned by a vacuum charger having an attachment with a vertically
arranged screw conveyor by means of which the sausage meat

is pressed through a perforated plate, a rotating cutting device being
provided at a distance below the perforated plate for cutting the extruded

sausage meat in strips which then fall into a water bath arranged
below and are boiled there, in a subsequent step the boiled

rod-shaped strips are fried in boiling fat for a relatively short period of
time.
Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat as
claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the food product is drained or

dried after having been fried in boiling fat and is deep-frozen thereafter.
Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat as
claimed in claims 1 or 2, characterised in that coarsely minced lean

pork is added to the fine sausage meat after the production thereof
which is mixed with the fine sausage meat in the cutter at a low revolution

speed.
Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the final frying

in boiling fat is carried out at about 160° to 200° over a period of
time of about half a minute to 3 minutes
. 
Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that salt, phosphate

and spices are added at the beginning of the production of the
sausage meat.
Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that saccharides

are added during the production of the fine sausage meat.
Process for the preparation of a food product based on meat as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that in the first

step during the production of the fine sausage meat a larger of lean
pork and a smaller portion of fat meat, in particular bacon, is used in

order to obtain a food product with reduced fat content.
Food product based on meat, produced by the process according to
one or several of claims 1 to 7.
