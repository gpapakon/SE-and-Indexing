<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing crude noodles having nerve, viscoelasticity, smoothness and tackiness unique thereto, 
resistant to softening upon being dipped in hot water, and preservable at ordinary temperature for long, which process 

comprises the steps of (1) preparing an outer-layer dough by kneading powdery raw material, such as wheat flour, 
and water, (2) preparing an inner-layer dough having a pH in a neutral or weakly alkaline range by mixing powdery 

raw material, such as wheat flour, with alginic acid and/or a salt thereof and an alkaline agent, and kneading the 
resultant mixture and water, and (3) preparing noodle belts from each of the outer-layer and inner-layer doughs in 

the conventional manner, combining and rolling the belts into a noodle belt having an outer-layer/inner-layer/outer-layer 
structure, forming noodle strings therefrom in the conventional manner, gelatinizing the starch component of the 

wheat flour, treating the resultant strings with an acid solution to adjust the pH of the strings to be an acidic range, 
packaging and hermetically sealing the strings, and sterilizing the product by heating, wherein the gelatinization may 

be conducted at the same time with the treatment with an acid solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing wet and
fresh three-layered noodles having a longer shelflife and an excellent
taste and texture.In general, noodles having a high water content tend to be spoiled by
microorganisms such as bacteria and molds. Therefore, in order to keep
the shelflife of the noodles, even at room temperature, for a long term over
several months, the noodles have often been dried
by hot-air drying, sun drying, frying or vacuum
drying
thereby reducing the water content.
However, once the water content of the noodles has been
reduced, it is difficult to obtain the desirable texture of non-dried
fresh noodles even if the dried noodles are rehydrated and
restored for eating with water or hot water. Accordingly, research and
development on wet noodles which can be preserved even at room
temperature without drying the fresh noodles has been continued.The wet noodles are called, generally, fresh noodles and are
include boiled noodles, steamed noodles, raw noodles having high
water content, or noodles having slightly reduced water content in
comparison with the foregoing noodles, and "desirable texture of
fresh noodles" referred in this specification is directed to the texture
of noodles just cooked by boiling or steaming, and in particular to the 
texture of "smoothness" and stickiness" of the noodles, in addition to
"stiffness" and "elasticity" thereof.As methods to preserve the wet fresh noodles for several months at
room temperature, there have been known methods, i.e., a method of
adding bacteriostat(s), such as propyleneglycol, a method of sterilizing
by retort, and a method of combining pH adjustment with heat
sterilization. However, the former method of adding bacteriostat(s)
does not provide a good image to consumers in view of using additives,
and the latter method of so-called retort sterilization that conducts
sterilization for over 4 minutes at 120 Â°C or similar conditions is not
preferable, because the colour of the noodles becomes dark and the
desirable texture of noodles is lost. Further, in the method for
improving shelflife by using both pH adjustment (to acidify the noodles)
and heat sterilization, "stiffness" and "elasticity" are lost, so the
desirable texture of the noodles is also not obtained, because the
water penetrates into the inside of the noodle threads after the
sterilizing step and the moisture gradient between the inside and the
outside of the noodle threads is lost.The present inventors have developed a process for producing wet
noodles

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing fresh three-layered
noodles, comprising the steps of:


(1) preparing an outer-layer dough by, if
necessary, adding starches, alkaline agents, salts, or

other compounds used commonly in producing noodles to
flours comprising, wheat flour, or wheat flour and grain

flours as major ingredients, and kneading with water the
flours or the mixture;
(2) preparing an inner-layer dough having pH
of from neutral to weak alkaline by adding

alkaline agents, one or more element(s) selected from the group
consisting of

alginic acids,
alkaline metal salts of alginic acids, and/or magnesium salts

or ammonium salts of alginic acids, and, if necessary,
starches, salts, or other compounds used commonly in

producing noodles, to flours comprising, wheat flour, or
wheat flour and grain flours as major ingredients, and

kneading the mixture with water;
(3) preparing dough sheets from said inner-layer
dough and said outer-layer dough through

conventional techniques such as rolling, then conducting
a further rolling of the dough sheets so obtained to make

a dough sheet having an outer-layer/inner-layer/outer-layer
structure, and making noodle threads by

conventional techniques;
(4) treating the noodles by either (a)
subjecting the noodle threads to gelatinization and

treating the gelatinized noodle threads with acid
solution to acidify the noodle threads, or (b)

gelatinizing and acidifying the noodle threads with acid
solution simultaneously; and
(5) packing hermetically said pH-adjusted
noodle threads, and sterilizing them by heating.
A process for producing fresh three-layered
noodles according to Claim 1 wherein alginic acids and/or 

alginic acid salts are further added in said step (1),

noodles according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein alkaline agents

are added in said step (2) to adjust pH of the inner-layer

noodles according to any preceding claim, wherein pH of

noodle threads treated with acids solution in said step
(4) is less than about 6.
