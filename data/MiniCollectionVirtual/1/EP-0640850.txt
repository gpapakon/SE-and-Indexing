<ABSTRACT>
A microlens array sheet for a liquid crystal 
display including a first substance layer and a second 

substance layer has a refractive index less than that of the 
first substance layer. A plurality of minute unit lenses are 

formed by providing concaves and/or convexes to an interface 
between the first and second substance layers. When a ray 

having entered into the sheet from the normal-line direction of 
the second substance layer exits from the surface of the first 

substance layer, an refractive angle relative to the normal 
line of the surface of first substance layer is not less than 

30 degrees. When this microlens array sheet is attached to the 
surface of a liquid crystal cell of a liquid crystal display, 

an improved large angle of visibility can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microlens array sheet 
for a liquid crystal display, a method for attaching the same 
and a liquid crystal display equipped with the same. A microlens array sheet arranged with minute unit lenses 
such as convex lenses and concave lenses in a plane is expected 
for applications to liquid crystal displays, optically coupled 
optical elements or image input apparatuses, and research 
into this has been conducted. The microlens array sheets are typically classified into 
two types. One of the types is a microlens array sheet made by 
forming and arranging controlled concave and convex units 
(minute unit lenses) on a base plate having a flat surface using 
fine processing technology. The other is a microlens array 
sheet made by providing a distribution of refractive indices to 
appropriate minute unit portions in a planar base plate, that 
is, so-called flat-plate microlens array sheet. In liquid crystal displays, usually the display is 
performed by utilizing an electro-optical effect of liquid 
crystal molecules, that is, by using a liquid crystal cell 
arranged with optical shutters which change ray transmittance or 
reflectance by utilizing an optical anisotropy (anisotropy in  
 
refractive index), orientation, flowability and dielectric 
anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules, and applying an electric 
field or sending an electric current to appropriate display 
units. In the liquid crystal displays, there are a direct-sight 
type display in which an image displayed on a liquid 
crystal cell is directly observed, and a projection type 
display in which an image to be displayed is projected onto a 
screen from a front side or back side and the projected image is 
observed. The direct-sight type liquid crystal display (hereinafter, 
also referred to merely as "liquid crystal display" or "LCD") 
has a defect that the image quality changes depending upon 
direction of observation. Since generally it is set so that 
the best image quality can be obtained when observed from a 
direction normal to the display surface (hereinafter "normal 
direction"), the image 
quality deteriorates as the angle between the observation direction and 
the normal direction becomes larger. If 
the angle becomes larger than a certain angle, the 
image quality is out of a range which an observer can accept. 
Namely, the liquid crystal display has a defect that the range 
of the angle of visibility over which a good image 
quality (hereinafter, also referred to merely as "angle of 
visibility")
