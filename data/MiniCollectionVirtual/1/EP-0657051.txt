<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for giving patients individualised, situation-dependent medication advice are disclosed. Preferably, the invention is implemented in portable computers. The method is founded on knowledge-based computer technology and comprises a reminder function (1), a recording and storage function (2, 3), as well as a function for inductive data analysis (4) and rule generation. When the knowledge-based system (6) finds that a medicine should be taken, the computer emits a signal providing information on the type of medicine and the dose. The patient records the intake of medicine as well as his current state of health. This information is stored in a database together with the point of time. Inductive data analysis is used to spot the relationship between various events and symptoms as well as establish medication rules. These rules are refined upon as new information is recorded in the database, and are automatically adapted to changes in the patient's state of health.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method and apparatus for controlled individualized medication.This invention relates to a method for controlled individualised medication. Many chronic diseases in man require the administra¬ tion of various substances in order to counteract the dis ease and/or to keep down its symptoms. Medication often includes several different pharmaceutical preparations, each having its specific properties, duration of action, and so forth. Dosage and time intervals between admini¬ strations depend on the status of the disease, patient- specific factors, such as inheritance, age, weight, gene¬ ral state of health as well as diet and physical activi¬ ties. As a result, medication is a fairly complicated task to perform. In practice, this will manifest itself as variations in the patient's state of health. In the case of some diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, the symptoms may in a single day vary from making the patient incapacitated for work (rigidity, tremor, etc.) to leavin the patient almost untroubled.There are several different methods used for provid¬ ing recommendations as to the dosage and the time inter¬ vals between administrations. These recommendations are often founded on the adjustment of an initial concept based on pharmacokinetic information on the various pre¬ parations. The adjustments are made on the basis of recor dations of the patient's condition on various occasions. This information is interpreted by specialists, and used for adjusting the dosage and the time intervals. However, the methods currently used do not yield desirable results, the reason being that the pharmacokine tic effects of the preparations are not absolutely clear. The way the preparations move through the body is affecte by interactions with other preparations, enzymes and so forth, during the absorption and the distribution phase as well as during the metabolism and the secretion phase. Thus, the actual concentration of a preparation in the 

biophase, the duration of action and the effect cannot be predicted statistically using monotonic models. Another reason is that the evaluation of the patient's data is a complex operation since it involves many dependent vari- ables and since it further is difficult to lay down analy¬ tical models.It is likely that the state of health of certain groups of patients can be drastically improved by optimum, individualised and situation-dependent medication. This would result in enhanced quality of life, as well as fewe sickness pensioners.GB 2,218,831 teaches an apparatus for helping

CLAIMS
1. A method for controlled, individualised medica- tion, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by recording, every time the patient takes his medicine, the type of medicine, the dose and the point of time in a database, recording information on the patient's state of heal on recurrent occasions in the database, analysing the information recorded in the database b means of inductive data analysis in order to establish medication rules on the basis of detected relationships between the patient's intake of medicine and his state of health, comparing the established medication rules with pre¬ determined medication conditions for approval, using the approved rules for continuously deciding whether medication is to be performed and, if so, deciding the type of medicine and the dose, and repeating the analysis of the database for conti¬ nuously optimising the medication rules with the aid of new information recorded in the database and for adapting the rules to changes in the patient's state of health. 2. A method as set forth in claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i s e d by the medication comprising the admini¬ stration of at least two different medicines.
3. A method as set forth in claim 1 or 2, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i s e d by also recording information on the patient's intake of food and his activities in the data¬ base, and taking this information into consideration when establishing the medication rules.
4. A method as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by always recording the patient's state of health when recording his intake of medicine. 


 5. A method as set forth in any one of the preced¬ ing claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by calculating the relations in time between various external events recorded and the state of health recorded. 6. A method as set forth in any one of the preced¬ ing claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by allotting a duration of action to each medicine, and continuously calculating the remaining duration of action of the medicine taken. 7. A method as set forth in any one of the preced¬ ing claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by using the dose and the remaining duration of action as attributes in the inductive data analysis.
8. A method as set forth in any one of the preced- ing claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by being used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
9. A device for controlled, individualised medica¬ tion, c h a r a c t e r i s e d by means (2) for record ing information on the intake of medicine and the pa- tient's state of health, a database (3) for storing this information, a program (4) for performing an inductive analysis of the information stored in the database and establishing medication rules on the basis of detected relationships between the intake of medicine and the patient's state of health, memory means (5) for storing predetermined medication conditions, means (5) for com¬ paring the medication rules established by means of the program for performing inductive analysis and the pre¬ determined medication conditions for approval of the medi cation rules, an expert system (6) where the approved rules are used for deciding whether medication is to be performed and, if so, which type of medicine and what dos should be given, means (7) for activating the program for inductive analysis at given points of time, and means (8) for polling the expert system at given points of time.
