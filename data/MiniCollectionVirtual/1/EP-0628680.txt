<ABSTRACT>
The latch has a cover-plate fixed to the door etc., and which has top and bottom parts with a bore through them. The bottom part contains a guide bush in which the latch guide turns, this being secured by a circlip engaging in a peripheral groove. On the end (3) of the bush (2) protruding from the bottom part (1) is a covering rosette (4). The latter can have a locking bead (5) on the inside and engaging in a groove (6) in the outside of the bush, and it can also have an external protruding edge (7). The rosette can be of plastic, high-grade steel, or non-ferrous metal such as brass or bronze. Its other edge (13) can have a spring effect, being inclined to the axis of the catch neck (9).

A handle device, with a cover plate for fixing on an object, the said 
device consisting of a top part (8) and a bottom part (1), which 

parts have a passage bore, a guide bush (2) for the rotatable 
mounting of the handle guide being accommodated in the bottom 

part (1) the handle being secured by a hairpin spring (15) engaging 
in a peripheral groove (14) of the handle guide, characterised in 

that a compensating rose (4, 18 or 24) is provided at the guide 
bush (2) projecting from the cover plate and covers the end zone 

(3) thereof. 
A handle device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
compensating rose (4) has a detent bead
 (5) in the inner zone, 
such bead bearing against a groove (6) provided at the outer 

periphery of the guide bush (2). 
A handle device according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
the compensating rose (4) has a continuous projecting edge (7) on 

the outer periphery. 
A handle device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
that edge (13) of the compensating rose (4) which covers the end 

zone (3) of the guide bush (2) extends obliquely to the centre line 
of the handle neck (9) and presses by its outer edge (10) against 

an undercut (11) on the handle neck (9), while its inner edge (12) 
bears against the end zone (3) of the guide bush (2). 
A handle device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
edge (13) exerts a spring effect.  

 
A handle device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
compensating rose (18) lies with its guide neck (19) between the 

inner bore (32) of the guide bush (2) and the guide shank (33) of 
the handle neck (9) and its bent-off collar (20) bears on the one 

hand by the top (21) thereof against the undercut (11) of the 
handle neck (9) and, on the other hand, by its free edge (22) 

against the outer edge (10) of the guide bush (2). 
A handle device according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
collar (20) exerts a spring effect. 
A handle device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
compensating rose (24) has a detent connection (29) in the inner 

zone, such detent connection bearing against a groove (6) 
provided at the outer periphery of the guide bush (2). 
A handle device according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
detent connection (29) is formed by a corrugation (30) formed in 

the limbs (31) of the compensating rose (24). 
A handle device according to claims 8 and 9, characterised in that 
spring limbs (28) bearing against the end zone (3) of the guide 

bush (2) are provided in the inner zone of the compensating rose 
(24), and extend from the central bore in a uniform distribution over 

the periphery. 
A handle device according to claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the compensating rose (4, 18 or 24) is made of plastic. 
A handle device according to claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the compensating rose (4, 18 or 24) is made from high-grade steel. 
A handle device according to claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the compensating rose (4, 18 or 24) is made from a non-ferrous 

metal, such as brass or bronze.
