<ABSTRACT>
A technique for modifying the IEEE 802.3 standard for selecting transmit-to-transmit 
interpacket gap (IPG) intervals in a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with 

Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) network, in the event that a node has captured the 
network communication channel. If there is a small number of active nodes on the 

network, one node may capture the channel and the standard backoff algorithm makes it 
increasingly unlikely for another node to transmit. The new technique provides for less 

aggressive, i.e. longer, interpacket gap (IPG) intervals to be used by a node that has 
captured the channel, thereby increasing the likelihood that another node will gain access.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to local area networks (LANs) of the
Ethernet type and, more particularly, to techniques for improving fairness of channel
access in an Ethernet LAN. Ethernet is a commonly used name for a LAN that uses a
network access protocol referred to as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Detection (CSMA/CD). The CSMA/CD protocol is defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 802.3,
published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., 345 East 45th
Street, New York, NY 10017, and referred to in this specification as "the IEEE 802.3
standard." The standard is for a 10 Mbps (megabits/sec) CSMA/CD channel, but it will
be understood that the present invention may also be applicable to a 100 Mbps channel.Under the CSMA/CD rules for access to a network bus or cable, which
will be referred to as the channel, any node or station wishing to transmit must first
"listen" to make sure that the channel is clear before beginning to transmit. All nodes on
the network have equal priority of access and may begin transmitting as soon as the
channel is clear and a required inter-packet delay of 9.6 µs (microseconds) has elapsed.
However, if a first node that has started transmitting detects a "collision" with a
transmission from another node, the first node continues transmitting for a short time to
make sure that all nodes wishing to transmit will detect the collision. Every other node
detecting the collision also continues to transmit for a short time. Then each node that
has detected a collision terminates transmission of the packet or frame. The nodes
involved in the collision wait for the required interpacket delay of 9.6 µs and then select
random, and therefore usually different, delay times, referred to as backoff times, before
trying transmission of the same packet again. More specifically, the IEEE 802.3 standard defines a collision backoff
procedure referred to as "truncated binary exponential backoff." When a transmission
attempt has terminated due to a collision, it is retried by the transmitting node, after a
selected backoff time, until either the transmission is successful or a maximum number
of attempts have been made and all have terminated due to collisions. The backoff time
is selected by each node as an integral multiple of the "slot time," which is the maximum
round-trip propagation time for the network, i.e. the time to propagate a data packet from
one end of the network to the other, and back. The slot time defined by the IEEE 802.3
standard is 51.2 µs. The number

A method of improving fairness of access to a network
channel in a network employing a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with

Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol for channel access wherein
there is a plurality of nodes, and wherein a plurality of data packets is

transmitted through the network channel, the method comprising the steps
of:


a first node sensing whether it has captured the network channel;
and
if said first node senses that it has not captured the channel, the
first node observing a prescribed transmit-to-transmit interpacket gap

(IPG) interval after completing a transmission of a data packet and before
an attempt at transmitting a next data packet; and
after the first node senses capture of the channel, the first node
selecting an increased transmit-to-transmit interpacket gap (IPG) interval

that is observed before any attempt at transmitting a data packet;
whereby the selected increased IPG interval gives any other node
that has not captured the network channel an increased likelihood of

transmitting before said first node.
The method as defined in claim 1, wherein the step of
sensing if said first node has captured the network channel includes:


sensing when a first data packet has been successfully transmitted
by said first node;
after transmitting the first data packet, and without any intervening
successful transmission by another node, obtaining access to the network

channel again following a collision; and 
sensing when a second data packet has been successfully
transmitted by said first node after obtaining access in the prior step.
The method as defined in claim 1, wherein:

the method further comprises a step of detecting a collision between
a transmission from said first node and a transmission from another node;

and
wherein the step of selecting an increased transmit-to-transmit IPG
interval includes selecting a progressively larger interval than the one

previously selected after each collision detected following a successful
transmission by said first node.
The method as defined in claim 3, wherein:

   the step of selecting a progressively larger IPG interval includes
increasing the IPG interval in equal steps until a maximum IPG interval

value equal to one slot time is reached, where the one slot time is the time
needed to propagate a signal from one end of the network to another end

and back.
The method as defined in claim 1, further comprising the
step of:

   the first node sensing when another node has successfully
transmitted a data packet and the first node reverting to use of the

prescribed transmit-to-transmit IPG interval.
An apparatus for improving fairness of access to a network
channel by a first node in a network employing a Carrier Sense Multiple

Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol for channel access,
the apparatus comprising: 


means for sensing when the first node has captured the network
channel for successive transmission;
means operative if said first node has not captured the channel, for
selecting a prescribed transmit-to-transmit interpacket gap (IPG) interval

after completing a transmission and before any attempt at transmitting a
next data packet by the first node; and
means operative after sensing capture of the channel by the first
node, for selecting an increased transmit-to-transmit interpacket gap (IPG)

interval that is observed before any attempt at transmitting a next data
packet by said first node;
whereby an increased IPG interval gives any other node that has
not captured the network channel an increased likelihood of transmitting

before said first node.
The apparatus as defined in claim 6, wherein the means for
sensing when first node has captured the network channel includes:


means for sensing when a first data packet has been successfully
transmitted by said first node;
means operative after transmitting the first data packet, and without
any intervening successful transmission by another node, for sensing when

said first node obtains access to the network channel again following a
collision; and
means for sensing when a second data packet has been successfully
transmitted by said first node after gaining access to the network channel

following the collision.
The apparatus as defined in claim 6, wherein:

the apparatus further comprises means for detecting a collision
between a transmission from said first node and a transmission from

another node, wherein:
the means for selecting an increased transmit-to-transmit IPG
interval includes means for selecting a progressively larger interval than

one previously selected after each collision experienced following a
successful transmission by said first node.
The apparatus as defined in claim 8, wherein:

   the means for selecting a progressively larger IPG interval includes
means for increasing the IPG interval in equal steps until a maximum IPG

interval value equal to one slot time is reached, where the one slot time is
the time needed to propagate a signal from one end of the network to

another end and back.
The apparatus as defined in claim 6, further comprising:

   means operable after channel capture by the first node, for sensing
when another node has successfully transmitted a data packet and for

reverting the first node to use of the prescribed transmit-to-transmit
interpacket gap (IPG) interval.
