<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
inorganic solids as catalysts which contain imprints of 

molecules in the form of cavities, which molecules in their 
three-dimensional structures conform to intermediates or 

transition states of chemical reactions to be catalyzed, 
characterized in that inorganic or organometal monomer units are 

polymerized in the presence of the molecules to be imprinted, 
wherein the molecules to be imprinted have been chemically 

bonded to anchor groups (mo nomer units) and are admixed prior 
to or in the beginning of the polymerization process and the 

imprinted molecules are subsequently removed after the polymerization, 
to the resulting catalysts and to the use thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many chemical products are prepared by using a homogeneous 
or heterogeneous catalyst. Enzymes, i.e. catalysts of the biological 
systems, consisting of polyproteins operate under mild 
conditions with a high activity and selectivity. Many commercially 
important heterogeneous catalysts may be described as 
chemically, thermally and mechanically stable inorganic support 
materials (metal oxides in most cases) having a large total 
surface area and comprising a high concentration of finely 
distributed active sites on their surfaces (Catalyst Handbook, 
Editor: M.V. Twiggs, Second Edition, Wolfe Publishing, Cleveland 
1989). In comparison to enzymes, these catalysts are capable 
of catalyzing a substantially broader spectrum of chemical 
reactions. The particular stability thereof allows them to be 
used at high temperatures (high space-time yields) with high 
conversion figures, frequently a relatively simple regenerability 
and an easy catalyst recovery. With respect to all of 
these properties commercial catalysts are mostly superior to the 
enzyme catalysts. However, so far unattainable by such commercial 
catalysts are the high selectivity and substrate specificity 
of enzymes. An important contribution to heterogeneous 
catalysis would be afforded by a development of heterogenous 
catalysts that are capable of combining both of the properties 
of the two systems mentioned - the high activity and stability 
of the commercial catalysts and the high selectivity of the 
natural catalysts. The specificity is provided by the spatial structure of the 
active site in the enzyme. Enzymes accelerate reactions by 
stabilizing the transition state of the reaction. This means  
 
that the enzyme has a higher affinity to the transition state 
or to a molecule analogous thereto (transition state analogue) 
than to the starting materials or final products of a reaction 
{L. Pauling, Chem. Eng. News24 (1946) 1375}. This postulated 
interpretation of the catalytic activity of enzymes has been 
confirmed long ago by X-ray structure analyses of the bonding 
sites of various enzymes. The affinity of enzymes to transition 
state analogues or structurally similar compounds is utilized 
to an increasing degree for blocking enzymes (enzyme inhibitors) 
{P.A. Bartlett, C.K. Marlowe, Biochemistry22 (1983) 4618}. 
Although the use of enzymes in chemistry continuously increases, 
it is limited by the availability of these evolutionary 
catalysts for individual reactions. So far there has not been 
any possibility of
