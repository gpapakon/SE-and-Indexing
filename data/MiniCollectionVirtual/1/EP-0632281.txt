<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to bare integrated circuit die testing apparatus of the kind 
comprising a testing station wherein a plurality of microbumps of conductive material are 

located on interconnection trace terminations of a multilayer interconnection structure, which 
terminations are distributed in a pattern corresponding to the pattern of contact pads on the die 

to be tested. To facilitate testing of the die before separation from a wafer using the 
microbumps, the other connections provided to an and from the interconnection structure have 

a low profile.

<DESCRIPTION>
Silicon integrated circuit devices (SICs) are processed in 
wafer form and initial device testing is conducted on the completed 
wafer prior to dicing, using a probe card or, more recently, a 
membrane probe card, to make electrical contacts to the contact pads 
of the ICs under test. A conventional probe card comprises a 
radial array of metallic probes supported in a circular aperture on 
a printed circuit board. The probes are provided with fine probe 
tips, commonly fabricated using fine tungsten wire which has been 
formed to a spherical tip shape at the point of contact, with a 
typical tip diameter of 50 micrometres. The probe tips are 
typically 0.5 mm in length and 0.15mm diameter. Contact forces of 
6 to 8 grams per probe are employed to ensure that low contact 
resistance to the aluminium alloy metallisation pads on the IC is 
obtained. A probe set is expected to provide some 0.5 million 
touch downs before replacement. The probes are independantly 
mounted and adjusted to ensure consistent contact. Tungsten is 
selected as the probe material since it provides high hardness for a 
low probe wear rate and low electrical resistivity for low probe 
resistance.  Device tests on wafer include basic parametric tests, low 
frequency functional testing and, in some cases, speed bining tests 
using specially designed test structures, or boundary scan testing. 
The relatively high resistance and particularly the inductance of 
the conventional probe card arrangement, however, precludes thorough 
device testing at full operating frequency. A further constraint 
on wafer level testing is associated with the finite test time 
required to conduct a comprehensive functional test, particularly 
when this testing is conducted at less than functional speed. The 
mechanical difficulties associated with constructing conventional 
probe cards for very high pin count ICs is one reason that 
alternative probe card approaches are now being examined. Once the ICs that have passed the wafer level probe testing 
have been packaged, then comprehensive functional testing can 
proceed. The package provides mechanical protection for the IC, to 
allow straightforward device handling in the test system feeder, and 
also a practical means of making contact to them device under test 
through the package leads. Packaged devices may be fully 
functionally tested at speed in generally acceptable test times. A more recent advance in wafer level IC testing has been 
the introduction of the membrane probe card structure. Here a
