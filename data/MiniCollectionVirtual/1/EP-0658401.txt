<ABSTRACT>
A polishing apparatus is provided which can effect 
surface-based polishing of a wafer without causing the 

wafer to produce an undulation or peripheral protrusion. 
A sheetlike polishing member 5 constructedby 

superposing a foam sheet 2 containing minute closed 
cells in a web of chloroprene rubber and a velour type 

non-woven fabric (polishing cloth 3) is attached fast to 
the surface of a polishing table 1. The polishing 

member is capable of polishing a given wafer while 
maintaining the uniformity of thickness of the wafer or 

an oxide film formed on the surface of the wafer 
because, during the application of pressure by a 

pressing member 14, the polishing pressure is uniformly 
distributed throughout the entire rear surface of the 

wafer and the polishing member is bent in conformity 

with the global rises and falls in the wafer surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polishing member and a
polishing apparatus for polishing wafers and more
particularly to a polishing member and a polishing
apparatus which are adapted for the technique of
planarization machining aimed at conferring improved
flatness on semiconductor devices (see for example EP-A- 0 465 868).In consequence of the advance of the trend of
semiconductor devices toward greater integration and
larger capacity, the technique for imparting minimized
diameters to wires and the technique for increasing the
number of component layers of multilayer wires have been
acquiring growing importance.When a wire has a minimized diameter, the ability
of an insulating film to be superposed on the wire or
the ability of the wire to be covered with the
insulating film is degraded because the end face of the
wire inevitably gains in precipitousness. When a
multilayer wire has an increased number of component
layers, it betrays heavy surface irregularities because
of accumulation of irregularities on the underlying
layers or on the insulating film. When a wire is to be
superposed on the surface of this multilayer, the 
superposition is attained only with inferior wiring
precision because the stepper is no longer focussed
accurately on the irregular wire surface. In any event,
these surface irregularities tend to cause breakage in
the wire and impair the reliability of a semiconductor
device using the multilayer wire.Various techniques for flattening wire surfaces
have been developed for the purpose of solving this
problem. The glass flow method, for example, aims to
provide a wire with a flattened surface by forming a
glass film such as of PSG, BPSG, etc. by the CVD and
then heating the glass film at a temperature in the
range of from 800 to 1,100Â°C thereby generating viscous
flow of the glass film. Though this method is simple as
a process, it is at a disadvantage in limiting the
material to be used for the wire because of the high
temperature which is required for heating the glass
film and, therefore, is not tolerated by aluminum.
Various other methods have been developed. They have
both merits and demerits. None of them perfectly fits
the purpose of surface smoothing under consideration.In recent years, the researches after a method for
producing a smooth surface by utilizing the technique
of wafer polishing has been under way with a view to
overcoming this discouraging state of prior art.
Specifically, in the process of manufacture of a
semiconductor device, the researches are aimed at the
