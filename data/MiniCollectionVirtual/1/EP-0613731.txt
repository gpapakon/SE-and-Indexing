<ABSTRACT>
Mail routing system comprising an input system (1), a postal 
transmission system (2) and an output system (3). Electronic replicas are 

made of the addressing information of the items of mail, which replicas are 
then converted into control codes which are used to drive routing elements 

(10). On the input side - at least in the case of items of mail for which the 
conversion into control codes is relatively time-consuming - only the most 

significant part of the control code, necessary for routing the items of mail to 
the correct output system, is generated. During transport, or upon arrival, the 

less significant part of the control code is then additionally generated. The 
conversion elements (8) form, by means of a network (12, 13), a conversion 

pool, as a result of which the conversion capacity can be spread optimally over 
the various input channels (a...n) and various input and output systems. An 

interpretation element (14) derives from the conversion results of the various 
conversion elements (8), by comparing and supplementing, the most likely 

control code.

<DESCRIPTION>
Where necessary, the content of the European Patent Application 
EP 92200444.5 and the European Patent Application EP 92201486.5, both in 
the name of the Applicant, are deemed to be part of the present application. The invention relates to a mail routing system comprising an 
input system (1), a postal transmission system (2) and an output system (3), 
the input system being provided with input means (4) for inputting items of 
mail, scanning means (5) for scanning the addressing information, such as 
postcode and destination address, which is physically present on the items of 
mail, and converting it into electronic or optical replicas, an identification 
code generator (6) for assigning identification codes to each input item of mail 
and corresponding replica, and means (7) for applying to each item of mail 
such an identification code in machine-readable form, the input system 
comprising conversion means (8) or being connected thereto, for converting 
said replicas into machine-readable control codes, and both the input system 
and the output system being provided with routing means (10) for routing, 
under the control of such machine-readable control codes, the items of mail to 
the place of destination. Such a system is disclosed by the European Patent 
Application EP 92200444.5 in the name of Applicant. This application, in 
particular, deals with the possibilities offered by electronic control codes, 
namely the ability to mutate or change them, in order to be able to manipulate 
items of mail remotely and, for example, to cause an item of mail to be 
delivered at an address different from that stated by the original addressing 
information, or to cause the item of mail to be delivered in a particular period 
of time. The object of the present invention is to guarantee an improved  
 
passage of the items of mail to be routed through the routing system. Another 
object of the invention is to reduce the percentage of items of mail whose 
addressing information cannot be converted automatically, the "rejects". The invention is based on the insight that, for those cases where 
on the input system side the address data of the items of mail cannot be 
converted automatically and in a short time into complete control codes (in 
electronic or optical or alternatively in bar code form) it is sufficient to use an 
incomplete control code as long as this is capable of driving the first routing 
step, the routing means of the input system, correctly. If that control code is 
sufficient to send the item
