<ABSTRACT>
A folding top for a cabriolet (convertible) has a folding-top frame (1), the side-frame parts (3, 8) of which, which are each arranged symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and comprise front and rear subpieces, are each supported, via a main pillar (4) and a main guiding rod (5), on a rear main bearing (6) of the body frame in a manner which allows them to pivot, and the roof end (9) of which folding-top frame bears, in the closed position, on the upper transverse strut of a windscreen frame. In the front region, the folding-top frame (1) is designed as a one-piece shaped supporting part (2) which has an U-shaped contour and on the base of which, which forms the roof end (9), via a respective connecting zone there are formed, as profiled limbs, in each case the front side-frame parts (8), which each have, at their front ends, at least one articulated connecting element (16) directed towards the main pillar (4).

A top for cabriolet vehicles, with a top frame (1) the side frame parts (3, 8) of 
which each consisting of front and rear parts which are disposed respectively 

symmetrically in respect of the longitudinal axis through the vehicle, are each supported 
via a main pillar (4) and a main guide rod (5) for pivoting movement on a rear main 

mounting (6) on the body flame and of which the apex (9) of the roof, when in the closed 
position, bears on the upper transverse member of a windscreen frame, characterised in 

that the top frame (1) is in its front portion constructed as a one-piece moulded carrier 
part (2) of U-shaped contour and has on its base web, which forms the roof apex (9), front 

side frame parts (8) which are integrally formed as profiled members, via respective 
connecting zones, said profiled members having at their free ends at least one respective 

articulating element (16) which is directed towards the main pillar (4). 
A top according to claim 1, characterised in that the carrier part (2) has seatings 
(11) for the top closure means. 
A top according to claim 1, characterised in that the rear side frame part (3) and the 
main pillars (4) are in each case constructed as one-piece moulded parts. 
A top according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the connections 
between the front side frame parts (8) are integrally moulded in one piece in the carrier 

part (2) and the rear side frame parts (3) as well as the connections between the rear side 
frame parts (3) and the respective main pillar (4) are constructed as mechanical 

connections. 
A top according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the carrier part (2), 
the two rear side frame parts (3) and the t
wo main pillars (4) of the top linkage (1) are 
produced from pressure die cast aluminium or a similar lightweight structural material.
