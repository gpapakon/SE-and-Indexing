<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic system is described which has a variable-displacement hydraulic pump (10), the outlet pressure of which can be controlled as a function of a pressure applied to a load-indicating connection (18), a supply tank (22), a hydraulic function (12, 13, 14) with a feed line (34), and a valve arrangement (16) located between hydraulic pump (10), supply tank (22) and hydraulic function (12, 13, 14). In order to produce a load signal absent at the hydraulic function (12, 13, 14), by means of which load signal the hydraulic pump (10) can be regulated, it is proposed that a valve (24) be arranged between the feed line (34) and the load-indicating connection (18). A control spool (26) of the valve (24) is pushed by a spring (40) and a pressure acting on its first side into a closed position and by a pressure acting on its second side into an open position in which a control connection between the feed line (34) and the load-indicating connection (18) is open. Reversing valve means (42, 44) are provided, by means of which different pressures can alternatively be applied to the first and the second side of the control spool (26). When using a hydraulic function (12, 14) with a constant-flow hydraulic circuit, the first side of the control spool (26) is connected to the supply tank (22) and the second side of the control spool (26) is connected to the feed line (34) by the reversing valve means (42, 44), and, when using a hydraulic function (13, 14) with a constant-pressure hydraulic system, the first side of the control spool (26) is connected to the feed line (34) and the second side of the control spool (26) is connected to the pump outlet by the reversing valve means (42, 44).

A hydraulic system with an adjustable hydraulic pump (10), whose output pressure can be 
controlled in dependence on a pressure present on a load signal port (18), a reservoir (22), at least 

one hydraulic function (12, 14) with a feed line (34) and a valve arrangement (16) arranged 
between the hydraulic pump (10), the reservoir (22) and the hydraulic function (12, 14), this 

arrangement comprising a control slider (26) of a valve (24), on which a spring force acts and 
which is urged into a closed position by a pressure acting on its first end and into an open 

position by a pressure acting on its second end, characterized in that the valve (24) is arranged in 
a control connection between the feed line (34) and the load signal port (18) and opens and closes 

this and in that the valve (24) further opens a passage (76) between the pump outlet and the feed 
line (34) in its open position and blocks this passage (76) in its closed position.

in the form of an open hydraulic system and in that the control slider (26) of the valve (24) is 

subjected at one end to the force of a spring (40) and the pressure obtaining in the reservoir (22) 
and is urged thereby into a closed position and is subjected at the other end to the pressure in the 

feed line (34) and is urged by this into an open position, in which a control connection is opened 
between the feed line (34) and the load signal port (18).
