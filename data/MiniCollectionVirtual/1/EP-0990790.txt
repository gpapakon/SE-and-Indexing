Fuel filter having a housing which consists of
plastic and on which at least two connections for an

inlet and an outlet are formed and in which the plastic
consists of electrically nonconductive material, in

particular for motor vehicles, 
characterized in that
 a
continuous strip (21) of electric
ally conductive
material is arranged on the outwardly pointing surface

(19) of the plastic housing (11) between the two
connections (14, 16).
Fuel filter according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the material is an electrically conductive coating
which is applied in the form of a strip (21).
Fuel filter according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the strip-shaped coating (21) has
essentially a cross section of equal size over its

entire length.
Fuel filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the fuel filter (10) is designed
as a line filter with connecting stubs (14, 16)

situated on opposite end sides.
Fuel filter according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the strip-shaped coating (21) extends between the
two tubular connecting stubs (14, 16). 
Fuel filter according to Claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that
 the width of the strip-shaped
coating (21) is smaller than the outside diameter of

the connecting stubs (14, 16).
Fuel filter according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the housing (11) comprises a cup-shaped
housing part (12) and a cover (15) and the

strip-shaped coating (21) fits over the gap separating
them.
Fuel filter according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 a plurality of strips, in
particular two or three strips, which are guided

parallel to one another and are offset radially to one
another are arranged on the surface of the housing.
Fuel filter according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 the width of the strip-shaped
coating (21) is between 5 and 10 mm in order to ensure

favourable electrical conductivity.
