<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hardening
compositions for civil engineering and construction works.
More particularly, it relaters to hardening
compositions which give a hardened product having high
compressive strength and high dimensional accuracy.There has hitherto been known a phenomenon in which
an alkaline earth metal hydroxide is hardened by reaction with
a carbonic acid gas in atmosphere. However, with such
phenomenon, the rate of reaction is so slow that a hardened
mass having a sufficient strength cannot be produced within a
reasonable period of time, while the hardened mass has a
nonuniform inner structure because of retarded inner
carbonisation. In order to overcome such problem, a
carbonised hardened mass has been proposed which is obtained
by wet reacting an alkaline earth metal hydroxide with an
organic carbonic acid compound (Japanese Laid-open Patent
Publication No.1-270552).However, a hardened product employing the alkaline
earth metal hydroxide has a drawback that it has a high
contraction ratio of 6 Ã— 10-4 and poor dimensional accuracy. JP-A-01270552 describes inexpensive carbonated cured
materials obtained by blending 100 parts by weight of
alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as calcium hydroxide or
magnesium hydroxide, 20-30 parts by weight of an inorganic
carbonate such as sodium carbonate, 5-20 parts by weight of
an organic carbonate such as methylamine carbonate, and
optionally an aggregate or a filler. The resulting
hardening composition is said to exhibit low shrinkage.S.F. Fedorov et al., cited in Chemical Abstracts, Vol.
79, Page 137, No. 128629k (1973) describe core binder
compositions containing 25-48% aluminophosphate, 2-5% urea,
0.1-0.5% surfactant, and the balance magnesium oxide. The
resulting binder could be applied without hot drying.V.F. Gridko et al., cited in Chemical Abstracts, Vol.
90, Page 297, No. 191554z (1979) describe improved setting
of concrete with reduced shrinkage by the addition of 75-92
weight percent unslaked lime to a complex additive
containing 6-20 weight percent sodium sulphate and 2-5
weight percent urea.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
hardening composition which is hardened within a reasonable
hardening time period and which gives a hardened mass having
a high compressive strength and high dimensional accuracy.The above and other objects of the present invention
will become apparent from the following description. The present invention provides a hardening composition consisting essentially
