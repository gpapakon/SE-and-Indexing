<ABSTRACT>
Linear drive (1) having a piston rod (13) linked to a double piston (20) by a flexible connection. A permanent connection is provided between the pressure chamber (32) and the piston/cylinder unit (3). A throttle check valve (36) is provided positioned in the region of the position rod between the double piston and the locking guide groove (12). A cylindrical hollow chamber (26) with a central opening (27) forms part of the interior of the hollow piston and contains two axially displaceable, sequentially arranged bushes (28, 29).

Linear drive (1), more particularly for cryogenic 
control valves in the liquid propellant lines of rocket 

propulsion systems, having a single-acting pneumatic 
piston and cylinder unit (3); at least one spring (11) 

which acts counter to the pneumatic force and loads the 
piston rod (7) in the direction of an end position; a 

locking gate (12) which is able to move transversely to 
the piston rod (7), is adapted to latch by diametrical 

faces in respective recessed areas (8, 9) of the piston 
rod (7) and is pneumatically actuated via at least one 

control piston (20); two separate pressure compartments 
(31, 32) adapted to be aerated and deaerated for operating 

the locking gate (21); a fluidic connection, open at least 
in most operating states, between one (32) of the said two 

pressure compartments and that side of the piston (5) of 
the piston and cyli
nder unit (3) acted upon by the 
pressure; and in the said fluidic connection having a 

valve (35) which temporarily enlarges the flow cross-section 
as the said pressure compartment (32), and hence 

the piston and cylinder unit (3), is being deaerated, 
characterised by 


a) a control rod (13) joined permanently to the locking 
gate (12) and actuating the same, 
b) a double piston (20) which actuates the end of the 
control rod (13) that is remote from the gate, 

extends into the two pressure compartments (31, 32) 
and seals them off from one another, 
c) between the double piston (20) and the end of the 
control rod (13) that is remote from the gate, a 

connnection which is resiliently compliant 
(compression spring 30) in the longitudinal direction 

of the control rod (13) and away from the locking  
 

gate (12) and which is adapted to move axially to a 
limited degree towards the latter (cavity 26; sleeves 

28, 29; stop surfaces 4, 15) until it reaches limit 
stops, 
d) a permanent fluidic connection between the pressure 
compartment (32) and the piston and cylinder unit 

(3), and 
e) constructing the valve that temporarily enlarges the 
flow cross-section of the said fluidic connection as 

a one-way restrictor (35) and positioning the same in 
the region of the control rod (13) between the double 

piston (20) and the locking gate (12). 
Linear drive according to claim 1, characterised by 

a cylindrical cavity (26) inside the double piston 
(20), the cavity being closed at one end and 

incorporating a central opening (27) at the other 
end, 
two sleeves (28, 29) arranged one behind the other 
and mounted in the cavity (26) so as to be 

displaceable axially to a limited degree, 
at least one compression spring (30) disposed between 
the sleeves (28, 29), and 
two stop surfaces (14, 15), which cooperate with the 
sleeves (28, 29), on the control rod (13) which 

projects into the cavity (26). 
Linear drive according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
by 


a one-way restrictor (35) having a valve piston (36) 
which concentrically surrounds the control rod (13) 

and is adapted to be displaced axially thereon, 
an annular-shaped flow gap (42) between the valve 
piston (36) and the case (2), 
a plurality of passages (37) running through the 
valve piston (36), 
two stop surfaces (39, 40) in the case (2), which 
limit the movement of the valve piston (36) and are 

fitted with an additional seal (41) if appropriate, 
at least one compression spring (38) which biases the 
valve piston (36) in the direction towards the 

locking gate (12), and 
an axial flow duct (16) inside the control rod (13) 
and in the vicinity of the one-way restrictor (35) 

with at least two openings (17, 18) running to the 
exterior of the control rod (13), at least one of 

which openings is calibrated (calibration insert 19). 
Linear drive according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterised by two stop surfaces (21, 22) on the 

double piston (20), which surfaces cooperate with the case 
(2) and are each fitted with an additional seal (23, 24). 
Linear drive according to one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterised by an extension protruding from the 

locking gate in the longitudinal direction of the piston  
 

rod, the said extension engaging in a corresponding 
depression in the recessed area of the piston rod when the 

piston and cylinder unit is locked in the pneumatically 
active end position and when the pressure in the pneumatic 

system is lost.
