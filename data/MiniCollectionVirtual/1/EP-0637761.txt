<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-absorptive
contact lens material and a process for producing a water-absorptive contact lens. More particularly, it
relates to a a process for producing a water-absorptive contact lens which has a
high water content and presents a comfortable feeling to
the wearer even after application of saponification
treatment,
whereby mechanical processing is easy.
EP-A-332 179 discloses a contact lens made of a highly
water-absorptive ocular lens material obtained by
saponification for hydrophilic treatment of a copolymer
composed essentially of a (meth)acrylate polymer, a fatty
acid vinyl ester and a crosslinking agent.A vinyl acetate monomer is a monomer excellent in
radical polymerizability. However, polyvinyl acetate
made of such a vinyl acetate monomer has a problem such
that the glass transition temperature is too low, and
processing is hardly applicable when it is intended to
use it practically as an ocular lens material.To solve such a problem, it has been attempted to
copolymerize the vinyl acetate monomer with various
monomers to increase the glass transition temperature of
the resulting polymer so that processing can be applied 
to such a lens material.However, vinyl acetate has poor copolymerizability
with a usual vinyl monomer such styrene or methyl
methacrylate and is likely to form a homopolymer.
Accordingly, a special polymerization method is required.
Further, even if vinyl acetate is copolymerized with
ethylene or a vinyl-type monomer having a relatively good
copolymerizability, the proportion of vinyl acetate is
limited in view of the operation efficiency due to the
tackiness of the resulting polymer, and it is difficult
to produce a polymer processable into a lens.Further, if vinyl acetate is copolymerized with a
polyfunctional monomer commonly employed as a contact
lens material, such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate,
the resulting vinyl acetate type copolymer will have a
high glass transition temperature, whereby processing
treatment can be applied to such a lens material if
carried out before application of saponification
treatment, but once saponification treatment has been
applied to such a lens material, the water content
decreases, and the flexibility will be poor, thus leading
to a problem that the resulting water-absorptive contact
lens presents an uncomfortable feeling to the wearer.Under these circumstances, the present inventors have
conducted extensive researches in view of the above
described prior art to develop a water-absorptive
