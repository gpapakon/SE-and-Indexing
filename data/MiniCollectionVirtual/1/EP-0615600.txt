 FLUOROELASTOMER LINED FLUE DUCTS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a Continuation-in-Part of copending application SerialNumber 07/805,632, filed December 12, 1991BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Flue gases, for example, from oil and coal-fired power generation facilities, typically contain corrosive components. The ductwork for carrying such gases in large power generation facilities can be 50 meters above ground level, so that repair and replacement is difficult and costly.A wide variety of techniques have previously been proposed for the construction or protection of such flue ducts. For example, in low temperature applications, coatings such as vinyl esters or epoxies have been tested. Calendared rubber sheeting has also been considered for protection of the inner duct surfaces. However, this requires either an adhesive or a large number of mechanical fastenings to keep it in place, and has not provided a satisfactory means of protection.Ducts have also been constructed of corrosion-resistant metals. Galvanized steel offers some protection against corrosive gases, while chromium- nickel alloys such as Hastalloy provide more effective protection. However, the high cost and difficulty in fabrication make such alloys an unattractive alternative. Still other protective measures that have been explored include the use of fluoroelastomer-based coatings. However, the solvents used in such coatings are difficult to handle, the coatings can only be applied in thin layers, and extensive preparation of the surface to be coated is generally necessary.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a flue duct lining that combines ease of installation and excellent protection against corrosive gases. Specifically, the present invention provides a lined flue duct comprising(a) a flue duct and(b) a flue duct liner comprising a laminate of a metal substrate having a thickness of about from 0.5 to 4 mm and a sheet of cured, hydrogen-SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 containing fluoroelastomer having a thickness of at least about 0.5 mm, the laminate being shaped to conform to the inner surface of the duct and attached thereto. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe drawing is a cross-sectional illustration of a lined flue duct of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The substrate used in the present invention can be in the form of a solid sheet, with the fluoroelastomer bonded thereto, or in the form of a perforated sheet or screen. In the event that the substrate is in the form of a screen,

I CLAIM:
1. A lined flue duct comprising
(a) a flue duct and (b) a flue duct liner comprising a laminate of a metal substrate having a thickness of about from 0.5 to 4 mm and a sheet of cured, hydrogen- containing fluoroelastomer having a thickness of at least about 0.5 mm, the laminate being shaped to conform to the inner surface of the duct and attached thereto. 2. A lined flue duct of Claim 1 wherein the metal substrate is perforated.
3. A lined flue duct of Claim 1 wherein the laminate is mechanically attached to the duct.
4. A lined flue duct of Claim 1 wherein the fluoroelastomer is a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene.
5. A lined flue duct of Claim 4 wherein the copolymer further comprises tetrafluoroethylene.
6. A lined flue duct of Claim 4 wherein the fluoroelastomer consists essentially of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene. 7. A lined flue duct of Claim 1 further comprising a barrier layer.
8. A lined flue duct of Claim 7 wherein a barrier layer consists essentially of at least one polymer selected from tetrafluoroethylene homopolymers and copolymers.
9. A lined flue duct of Claim 1 wherein the substrate has a thickness of about from 0.5 to 1.0 mm.
