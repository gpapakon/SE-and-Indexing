<ABSTRACT>
A universal processor-direct bus structure on a specifically partitioned motherboard (1) uses a separate local bus translator card (40) to adapt to a specific local bus protocol and configuration. The processor-direct bus (30) on the motherboard (1) contains a superset of all of the primary signals required to implement any desired local bus structure. The translator card incorporates the connectors and bus translation protocol for a specific local bus structure on a separate card which is connected to the partitioned motherboard (1) through the universal processor-direct bus. Thus, the universal processor-direct bus combined with the translator card (40) makes it possible to have a standard bus (for example an ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) bus, EISA bus, MCA bus, PCI bus, C-bus, S-100 bus and/or other buses) mounted directly on the motherboard (1) with one or more of the same standard buses or a different local bus (64) interfaced to the motherboard (1) through the universal processor-direct bus. This unique combination of a motherboard (1) having a universal processor-direct bus with plug in local bus translator cards (40) provides a unique, low cost, flexible solution to the problem of standard and local bus obsolescence, local bus non-upgradeability and local bus non-flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
 UNIVERSAL BUS MOTHERBOARD USING A UNIVERSAL-TO-SPECIFIC BUS TRANSLATOR CARDField of the InventionThe present invention relates to the main and auxiliary printed circuit boards used in IBM AT and compatible computers, and other general purpose and specific purpose computers. The focus of the present invention is on the expansion buses for interfacing peripheral devices such as disk drives, video display controllers, network interfaces, modems, fax cards, etc. to the main computer.Background of the Invention IBM AT or compatible computers ("clones") comprise by far the largest installed base of computers ever built. The core element of a typical IBM AT or compatible computer is a printed circuit board called a motherboard. The motherboard comprises at least one CPU or microprocessor (e.g., an Intel or compatible 80286, 80386, 80486 or 80X86 microprocessor) , memory (either chips mounted directly to the motherboard or SIMM sockets mounted to the board into which SIMM memory boards can be inserted), I/O ports, keyboard port, etc. Additionally, the motherboard usually has multiple identical I/O expansion slot connectors each of which contains multiple electrical contacts or pins. The corresponding pins of each slot connector are connected in parallel to provide the same signals on corresponding pins of each of these parallel slot connectors. This parallel arrangement of slot connectors in combination with a bus protocol for communication with the CPU, is referred to collectively as a bus. Specific peripheral or external devices(e.g., disk drives, modems, video controllers, tape drives, etc.) , communicate with the CPU via an interface card, called a bus adapter card, which is plugged into one of the slot connectors on the bus. Devices connected to the bus slot connectors communicate with the CPU by means of specific groupings of signals from the interface card with a specific translation protocol. 

 A typical bus has three principal groups of signal lines: 1) address lines providing a memory address; 2) data lines for providing data to the memory address; and 3) control lines for providing control and timing signals necessary for the address and data lines to relay the desired information to the CPU. Examples of commonly used bus structures include: ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) bus, EISA bus, MCA bus, PCI bus, C-bus, S-100 bus etc. Each type of bus is characterized by many factors including speed of operation, cost and acceptance in the marketplace. Generally, the buses are not compatible, i.e., an
