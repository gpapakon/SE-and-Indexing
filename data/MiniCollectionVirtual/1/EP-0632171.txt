<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a foldable scaffolding platform, in the case of which oblique supports, railing posts and, if appropriate, supports running downwards from the platform base in the operating position are connected in an articulated manner to at least one load-bearing member of the platform base, and which exhibits a securing device which secures the platform in the opened-out state and in the collapsed state. The invention consists in the fact that the securing device exhibits a pivotable catch (21) on that side of the platform which is directed away from a structure wall (17), which catch engages behind railings (12) and oblique support (7, 8) when the platform is in the opened-out state.
