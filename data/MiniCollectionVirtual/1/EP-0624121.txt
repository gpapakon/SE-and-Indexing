<ABSTRACT>
A conventional injection moulding process is modified in order to improve the quality of moulding in respect of the surface finish of one side of the moulding (1.16), reduce moulded-in stress and thereby reduce tendency to warp, and with increased scope for adding additional design features. This is achieved by the injection of a controlled amount of gas into the mould cavity to form a film (1.11) or layer of gas between one side of the mould cavity (1.12) and the adjacent skin of the substantially molten plastic (1.13) during or after filling of the mould with the plastic. This enables pressure to be exerted on the plastic by the gas of which the pressure is controlled from an external source (1.15). This invention includes methods of sealing the gas within the mould to prevent leakage thereby enabling the gas pressure to be controlled. The invention also includes methods of pressuring localised protrusions from the moulding general wall such as pillars, bosses, webs, ribs etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the injection moulding of 
thermoplastic and thermosetting materials. The conventional well-known and widely practised 
process of injection moulding involves heating of 
thermoplastic materials in granular or powder form to a 
melt temperature at which they become molten, and are 
then injected into a mould cavity under comparatively 
high pressures of up to 1400kg/sq cm (20,000lb/sq inch) 
or more. The moulds normally consist of two halves which 
are mounted on moulding machine presses and as a result 
of the high internal pressures within the mould cavities, 
high locking forces are necessary to prevent the mould 
halves from opening. The forces required are directly 
proportional to the projected area of the moulding or 
mouldings within the mould and the pressure within the 
molten plastic. High pressure is required in the first place to 
inject the comparatively viscous molten material into and 
then to fill the mould cavity or cavities. A secondary 
requirement is for the material to remain under pressure 
when cooling and being transformed from a molten into a 
solid state as the material is cooled by contact with the 
mould cavity surfaces which are at a lower temperature  
 
and below the melt temperature of the thermoplastic. As 
the material cools there is a natural volumetric 
shrinkage in the material and therefore it is necessary 
to force additional material into the mould cavity in 
order that the cavity shall continue to be completely 
filled with plastic, thereby creating a fully moulded 
part without sinkage marks on the mould surface when 
ejected from the mould. During recent years there have been numerous 
attempts at developing versions of injection moulding 
which reduce the requirements for high pressures and 
improve the quality of the mouldings with the reduced 
tendency of the material to sink away from the mould 
cavity surfaces during cooling. These processes include a 
group known as "gas-assisted or gas injection moulding" 
in which fluids or gases are injected into the molten 
material flow either during the injection of the plastic 
into the mould or following initial filling of the mould 
cavity with molten plastic. In both cases the gas forms 
channels or hollow sections within the plastic. Thereby 
it is possible to create and transmit a pressure through 
the gas within the plastic material and for the gas to 
expand to compensate for shrinkage in the molten 
material. At the same time the plastic material 
continues to be forced against the
