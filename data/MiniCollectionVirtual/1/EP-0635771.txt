<ABSTRACT>
A data transmission/reception system for wrist-type 
electronic timepiece. The data transmission/reception 

system for electronic timepieces comprises a data 
transmission device for generating data signals, and an 

electronic timepiece that receives data signals from the 
data transmission device by utilizing a coil for driving 

the hands, wherein the electronic timepiece is provided 
with a timing signal-generating means which generates a 

timing signal, and the data transmission device is 
provided with a timing signal-receiving means which 

receives the timing signals output from said hand-driving 
coil and transmits data signals in synchronism with the 

timing signals that are received. The data are 
transmitted and received in an ordinary hand-moving state 

without halting the timepiece while the functions are 
being operated. Therefore, there is no need of adjusting 

the time after the operation of the functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data 
transmission/reception system for electronic timepieces. 
More specifically, the invention relates to a data 
transmission/reception system that is capable of reliably 
executing mutual communication between an electronic 
timepiece and an external data transmission/reception 
device using upon timing signals generated by the 
electronic timepiece. There have heretofore been placed on the market 
electronic digital timepieces, having a wrist-computer 
function, that perform communication with personal 
computers using electromagnetic induction. There have 
also been proposed wrist-type electronic analog 
timepieces that perform pace adjustment by receiving 
standard time signals from an external standard time 
signal-generating device by utilizing a coil of a 
converter that drives the hands (for example, see 
Japanese Patent Publications Nos. 7190/1983 and 
7191/1983). In order for the timepiece to receive 
standard time signals of a period of one second from an 
external unit, the receiving condition is set by 
manipulating an external operating member such as the 
crown or the like and, at the same time, the 
frequency-dividing circuit is reset to wait for the input 
of a standard time signal. When a first standard time 
signal is input, the frequency-dividing circuit is 
liberated from the reset condition and a frequency 
deviation-measuring circuit starts counting. When a 
second standard time signal is input after one second has 
passed, a frequency deviation counted by the frequency 
deviation-measuring circuit is stored in a frequency  
 
deviation storage circuit to finish the automatic pace 
adjustment. The frequency-dividing circuit is reset 
again, automatically liberated from the reset condition 
after the passage of a predetermined period of time, and 
the ordinary operation is started. In the 
above-mentioned operation, a correct standard time signal 
of a period of one second fed from an external unit is 
counted by an internal counter and the timepiece 
operation is carried out by using this counted value as a 
subsequent period of one second. The standard time 
signal is received by utilizing a coil of a converter. The above-mentioned system is very convenient 
permitting even a finished timepiece to accomplish the 
pace adjustment. The above constitution, however, is a 
one-way communication system in which a timepiece 
receives a correct standard time signal of a period of 
one second from the external unit, which does not require 
the
