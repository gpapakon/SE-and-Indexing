<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for flash 
fixation for developing an electrostatic latent image used 
in electrophotography, etc. Hitherto, an image fixing method of a printing 
substrate in a printer using electrophotography 
includes a heat roller fixing method in which a printing paper 
is passed through heat rollers internally equipped with a 
motor lamp to pressurize a toner on the printing paper and an 
oven fixing method in which a printing paper is passed 
through an oven heated by infrared radiation. In these 
fixing methods, however, when a printing paper is 
jammed in a fixing portion, there is the disadvantage 
that a trace of pressure remains on the printing paper and 
the danger of fire is caused by high temperature heating. Recently, to solve these disadvantages, a photo-fixing 
method, represented by a flash fixing method, has been 
put into practical use in a printer which may be used 
automatically for a long period of time, for instance, in 
output of computers. The flash fixing method is a method in 
which the fixation is conducted by a flash of a discharge 
tube such as xenon flash lamp and which flash fixing method 
is characterized in (1) less resolving degree deterioration  
 
on fixing due to non-contact fixation, (2) relatively short 
warm-up time, (3) less danger of fire on a printing paper 
jamming, and (4) fixing being possible almost irrespectively 
of the thickness and the kind of materials of a printing 
paper. In the flash fixing method, however, without 
controlling the irradiation period and method and the amount 
of a flash energy for a toner image and the heat 
decomposability and viscoelasticity of a toner, a bursting-like 
blank area, called "void phenomenon", is partly formed 
in a fixed image. Thereby the image quality of a printed 
paper is deteriorated. In order to prevent the "void phenomenon", JP-A-Hei-2-22668 
proposes a toner to which an inorganic filler is 
added, JP-A-Hei-1-234857 proposes a toner containing a 
polyolefin wax, JP-A-Hei-4-328576 proposes a toner to which a 
thermoplastic resin grain is added, JP-A-Sho-59-129862 
proposes mixing of an epoxy resin with a styrene/acrylic 
resin, and JP-A-Hei-4-250464 proposes mixing of an epoxy 
resin with a crystalline polyester. (The term "JP-A" as used 
herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent 
application".) However, these approaches have still not 
provided satisfying and improved effects. In particular, there 
have been not provided any examples in which a styrene type 
resin is
