This is a blank for producing a device (structure) for holding and gripping at least two superposed layers of containers connected together at the top of each one of the said layers, and the structure obtained with such a blank. The blank comprises a rectangular central flap capable of covering the covers of the upper layer of containers. The central flap is equipped on either side with two lateral tabs (flaps) each comprising a central part substantially in the shape of a T, the upper bar of which is connected to the said central flap by a folding line, the central part comprising two identical, substantially rectangular, secondary tabs extending on either side, towards the outside and from the central leg of the T, parallel to the said folding line and being foldable with respect to the leg and arranged so as to be able to be fitted, in the folded-up state, between two parallel rows of the lower layer of containers.
