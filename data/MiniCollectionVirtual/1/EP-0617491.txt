<ABSTRACT>
For a light-emitting semiconductor element, a layer stack of AlGaAsN grown on a silicon substrate is provided. The emission wavelength can be adjusted over a wide range by choice of the Al content. Emission takes place in the visible spectral range. The layer stack of III-V semiconductor material matches the silicon substrate in regard to lattice structure.
