<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catalyst composition and a process
for the preparation of copolymers of carbon monoxide with one or
more compounds comprising an ethylenically unsaturated bond.From numerous patent applications it is known that linear
copolymers of carbon monoxide and one or more ethylenically
unsaturated compounds, in which copolymers the units originating
from carbon monoxide alternate or substantially alternate with the
units originating from the ethylenically unsaturated compound(s),
may be prepared by reacting the monomers under polymerization
conditions with a catalyst system which comprises a Group VIII metal
and an anion. Under the polymerization conditions concerned the
anion is non- or weakly coordinating with the Group VIII metal.The preparation of these copolymers may be carried out in the
liquid phase, i.e. such that the continuous phase is formed by a
liquid diluent, usually a non-polymerizable liquid in which the
catalyst dissolves, but in which the formed copolymers are
substantially insoluble. The recovery and purification of the
product normally requires a filtration or centrifugation step.
Moreover, a distillation step is usually required in order to
recover pure diluent.The preparation of the copolymers may also proceed in the gas
phase, whereby the continuous phase is formed by gaseous carbon
monoxide and possibly one or more of the other monomers, if they are
present in the gas phase under the prevailing polymerization
conditions. The gas phase preparation of the copolymers is
considered advantageous, because it allows a more simple product
recovery than the liquid phase process. The - at technical scale
costly - separation and purification steps inherent in the liquid
phase process can be omitted, thus improving the economy of the
process.Considerable efforts have been made to increase the activity of 
the catalyst system, some improvement resulting e.g. by changing the
reaction conditions or by modifying the components participating in
the catalyst. According to EP-A-239145 the catalytic activity is
enhanced by incorporating an oxidant, viz. a quinone, in the
catalyst system. The preferred amount is indicated as from 1-10000
and in particular from 10-5000 mol per gram atom of palladium. In
practice - according to the examples - the process is carried out in
the liquid phase, whereby the amount of quinone is 10 or 100 mol per
gram atom of palladium. EP-A-272728 teaches that other oxidants are
also suitable for enhancing the catalyst activity, vii. organic
nitrites and
