<ABSTRACT>
A slide for drawers having a body-side supporting rail (3) and a drawer-side extension rail (6) on each side of the drawer. Load-transmitting rollers (4, 16, 17) rest on the rails (3, 6). The rails (3, 6) have running webs for the rollers (4, 16, 17), and the rollers (4, 16, 17) of the supporting rails (3) and of the extension rails (6) are perpendicularly offset with respect to the pull-out direction of the extension rails (6), in such a way that the extension rails (6) are guided in two tracks. Resting on the extension rails (6) are two rollers (16, 17) arranged one above the other, which receive the running web (18) of the supporting rail (3) between them. A plastic bearing block (12) is arranged beside the upper roller (16) in the track of the roller (4) mounted on the supporting rail (3).
