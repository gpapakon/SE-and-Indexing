<ABSTRACT>
A fraud-proof identification system is provided with a point-to-point in focus imaging system preferably a line tracking arrangement for imaging skin profiles particularly of the thumb-top which contains relatively many continuous lines and avoids mental association with criminal finger print actions. Characteristics from skin profiles, preferably mutual line distances progressively measured along a selected skin line are compared with such information stocked in the system in order to discriminate upon authorization. A line tracking system is preferably provided with a servo-mechanism, a control signal of which acting as measuring signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fraud-proof identification system comprising means for
recording skin line profiles and means to extract geometrical characteristics from such
recordings to be compared with characteristics stored in a memory. The invention also
pertains to means use able in such systems.Fraud-proof identification systems, are used to discriminate whether or not a person
is authorized to do a certain action. Known systems of this kind are usually based on a code
such as a pin-code etcetera which is exclusively known to an authorized person. The need to
make use of tools such as a card with a personal code or something equivalent has the
disadvantage that an authorized person must have this available at the right place and the
right time. Such a tool can relatively easily come into the hands of un-authorized persons.
Codes do have the disadvantage that they can be stolen and need to be remembered at any
time by the authorized persons.In the identification system as disclosed in EP-A-300167 the reliability is restricted
due to the imaging method thereof.It is an object of the invention to mitigate these drawbacks and to this end a fraud-proof
identification system as listed in the preamble is characterised in that the skin line
profile recording means comprise a line tracking system for scanning one or more selected
lines of a skin line profile, the skin line profile recording means further comprising automatic
position dependent focusing means.In a system according to the invention the use of memorised codes is avoided and
thus stealing and forgetting is not a further problem whilst reconstruction of the finger print
line profile from the code is impossible. The fact that the imaging system for recording skin
line profiles works with an automatic position dependent focusing system no problem due to
for example different finger pressure on an imaging surface occurs.Characteristics from a skin-profile or a complete skin
line representation are compared with characteristics
stored in any memory consisting also of selected
characteristics or a full skin line profile. Position dependent focusing in reading skin line profiles can be realised by adjusting
the optical axis of a detection system preferably by an electro-mechanical system. With such
a system it is possible to track any skin line profile to determine its geometrical
characteristics. The measured characteristics are compared with finger line characteristics
stored in a memory. The distance between skin lines can now be measured very
