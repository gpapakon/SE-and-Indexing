<ABSTRACT>
Solutions such as for example groundwater, drinking 
water, extracting solutions and effluents contaminated with 

metals, radioactive species and organics, singly or in 
combination, are treated by first removing undesirable 

oxidizing agents from the contaminated solution; then the 
contaminated solution is separately treated with aqueous 

solutions of ferrous sulfate and hydroxide, which precipitate 
substantially all of the contaminants; next, the precipitate 

is treated with a flocculant and/or a coagulant to form an 
easily dewaterable and separable solid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to precipitation 
and flocculation methods for decontaminating various types of 
solutions which are contaminated with a variety of 
contaminants such as heavy metals, radioactive compounds, and 
organic compounds, using a combination of treatment steps. 
More particularly, this invention relates to methods for 
decontaminating solutions using aqueous solutions of ferrous 
sulfate and hydroxides, in combination with flocculants, to 
precipitate the contaminants and ultimately separate them from 
solution. There is increasing concern over the hazards posed 
by the rising levels of inorganic and organic contaminants 
within the world's water supplies due to accidental spills, 
leaks, mining practices and poor disposal practices. Most 
heavy metal and organic contaminants are toxic to some degree 
to all life-forms, and can have a deleterious effect on 
aquatic flora and fauna. In humans, toxic heavy metal 
poisoning can lead to severe nervous system disorders and can 
cause death. In addition, the contamination of drinking water, 
ground water, soil washing extracting solutions, and leaching 
solutions presents a further problem in that large volumes of 
solution typically are affected, making treatment especially 
problematic. This problem is aggravated in geographical 
locations where water is in short supply, and the need to 
recycle is great.  What is needed is a simplified, easy-to-operate 
method of treating large volumes of solutions containing 
soluble and insoluble heavy metals, radioactive contaminants, 
and organic contaminants, singly or in combination, which 
effectively segregates the contaminates from the clean 
solution and concentrates the contaminated material in a 
manageable, low volume, concentrated waste stream. There is 
a further need for a method that can effectively recover 
contaminants from extracting solutions used in soil washing 
processes, which allows recycling of the extracting solution, 
which requires a minimal amount of equipment and is economical 
to operate, and which further allows for the processing of 
recovered contaminants, such as metals, or other salable 
minerals. It is one of the objects of this invention to 
provide such a method. These and other needs are satisfied by the invention 
which is characterized by the steps of removing oxidizing 
agents from the contaminated stream; treating the stream with 
aqueous ferrous sulfate solution to reduce and/or precipitate 
the contaminants; treating the stream with an effective

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing heavy metal and/or 
radioactive contaminants from contaminated streams, said 

method characterized by the steps of: 

a. removing oxidizing agents from the 
contaminated stream; 
b. treating said stream with aqueous ferrous 
sulfate solution to reduce and/or precipitate the 

contaminants; 
c. treating said stream with an effective 
amount of a hydroxide solution, such that the precipitates, 

the contaminants, and/or the ferrous ions form coprecipitates 
with the hydroxide ion, the coprecipitates being substantially 

insoluble in the stream; 
d. treating the coprecipitate with a 
flocculant; and 
e. separating the flocculated coprecipitate 
from the clean stream.

said stream is selected from at least one of groundwater, 

leachate, a soil washing extraction solution, drinking water, 
and effluent. 
The method of claim 1 characterized in that 
said stream contains at least one radioactive contaminant. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
step (a) comprises reducing the pH of the stream, and/or 

aerating said stream. 
The method of claim 6 characterized in that 
step (a) comprises reducing the pH of the stream to about 7 

or less, and/or aerating said solution from about 1 to about 
24 hours. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
step (b) comprises adding said ferrous sulfate solution at a 

concentration sufficient to produce a green precipitate upon 
the addition of hydroxide ion in step (c). 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
the ferrous sulfate solution comprises from about 10 % to 

about 25 % ferrous sulfate by weight. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
step (c) comprises adding said hydroxide solution in an amount 

sufficient to increase the pH of the stream to at least about 
9. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
step (c) comprises treating said stream with a solution 

selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, 
calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, 

potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or mixtures thereof.

step (d) comprises adding said flocculant in an amount of from 

about 1 x 10⁻⁴ to about 5 x 10⁻³ pounds per pound of

said flocculated coprecipitates are separated from the clean 

stream by settling and/or filtration. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that
