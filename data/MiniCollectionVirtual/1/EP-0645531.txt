<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device (1) for distributing (splitting) fuel between the injectors (2) of a turbomachine. Distributors (splitters) (9) with two outlets (19a, 19b) are interposed between the injector lines (7). They are fed in parallel by the fuel supply pipe (3). Each distributor (9) feeds the two adjacent injectors (2a, 2b) and each injector (2) receives a fuel flow from the two adjacent distributors. Each distributor (9) includes two pistons (17a, 17b) with identical cross-sections and connected by a tension spring (18). The mass (Ma, Mb) of each piston (17a, 17b) is proportional to the barometric head h of fuel contained in the circuit (21a, 21b) which it supplies. The system is insensitive to load factors (g) and supplies the injectors (2) uniformly.

System for distributing the flow of fuel
delivered to the combustion chamber of a turbomachine

which has a number of injectors (2) spread out
circumferentially, the said system being inserted between

a fuel-inlet pipe (3) and the injectors and comprising
splitters (9) connected in parallel to the fuel inlet

pipe (3), each splitter comprising:

two fuel outlets (19a, 19b) connected respectively
to the two neighbouring lines (21a, 21b),
a valve body (10) delimiting a cavity (11) defining
two end chambers (13a, 13b) into which the said fuel

outlets (19a, 19b) respectively open, and a central
chamber (14) of a smaller diameter permanently communicating

with the fuel inlet pipe (3),
two pistons (17a, 17b) mounted so that they can
slide respectively in the said end chambers (13a, 13b)

and intended to alter the fuel outlet ports (19a, 19b) as
a function of their position (Xa, Xb) in the said end

chambers (13a, 13b), the said outlets (19a, 19b) being
provided opposite the said pistons (17a, 17b) and,
bypasses (20a, 20b) provided between each fuel
outlet (19a, 19b) and the corresponding end chamber so

that the pressure (Pa, Pb) of the fuel in the said outlet
(19a, 19b) exerts on the corresponding piston (17a, 17b)

a force which opposes the force exerted by the pressure
(Po) prevailing in the central chamber (14),

characterized in that there are the same number of
splitters (9) as there are injectors (2) and each of the

said splitters alternates circumferentially with the 
supply lines (7) for the injectors (2), in that t
he
splitter cavity (11) has an axis parallel to the overall

direction of the theoretical line which joins the two
injectors (2a, 2b) which are supplied by the said

splitter (9) and in that the two pistons (17a, 17b) are
joined together by elastic means (18) which exert on each

of the said pistons (17a, 17b) a force F which opposes
the force exerted on the said piston by the pressure (Po)

prevailing in the said central chamber (14).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the outlets (19a, 19b) of any arbitrary splitter (9)

are connected to the two adjacent lines by pipes (21a,
21b) which cross.
System according to either one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the mass (Ma, Mb) of a piston (17a,

17b) is proportional to the barometric head (h) of fuel
contained in the circuit between the outlet (19a, 19b) of

the end chamber (13a, 13b) containing the said piston
(17a, 17b) and the injector (2a, 2b) supplied by the said

outlet (19a, 19b).
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the fuel inlet pipe (3) supplies a

ring-shaped manifold (8) to which the splitters (9) are
connected.
System according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the two end chambers (13a, 13b) have

identical cross sections (Sa, Sb).
