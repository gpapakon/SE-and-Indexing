<ABSTRACT>
A paper roll (1) which has a tear-open wire on its outer surface is provided. The tear-open wire in turn has a catching tab (5) at its front end. A paper roll designed in this way can easily be freed from its packaging layer in a paper-roll unwrapping station (6) according to the invention. The paper roll (1) is deposited rotatably on the paper-roll unwrapping station (6); a tear-open table (12) movable in the longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the paper roll (1) has a catching hook (19) which receives the catching tab of the paper roll (1) when the tear-open table (12) is positioned appropriately on the end face of the paper roll (1). After the winding of the tear-open wire located on the end face has been removed from the paper roll (1), the tear-open table (12) is moved further on the frame (17) in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the paper roll (1), whilst the paper roll (1) simultaneously rotates for the unwinding of the tear-open wire, until the tear-open table (12) has arrived at the second end face of the paper roll (1).

other in the longitudinal direction of the paper reel
(1), and the tearing table (12) having a gripping

device (19) for gripping the element (5) of the tear
tape (4) to be gripped so that, with simultaneous

removal by means of a tensioning device (20, 21), the
tear tape (4) can be removed from the paper reel (1) in

its longitudinal direction by moving the tearing table
(12) away from the paper reel (1), or by moving the

paper reel (1) away from the tearing table (12), and in
the peripheral direction of the paper reel (1) by

rotating the paper reel (1).
Paper reel unwrapping station (6) according to
claim 6, characterised in that the rotary rollers (7a,

7b) are located on a driverless transport vehicle, in
that the tearing table (12) is arranged in a stationary

manner, and in that the paper reel (1) can be unwrapped
by the tearing table (12).
Paper reel unwrapping station (6) according to
claim 6, characterised in that the rotary rollers (7a,

7b), and on them the paper reel (1), are arranged in a
stationary manner, and the tearing table (12) can be

moved at least in the longitudinal direction of the
paper reel (1).
Paper reel unwrapping station (6) according to
claims 2 and 6 to 8, characterised in that the gripping 

device is a catch hook (19) for catching the catch
plate (5).
Paper reel unwrapping station (6) according to one
of claims 6 to 9, characterised in that the tearing

table (12) is also arranged to be movable on the end
face of the paper reel (1).
Paper reel unwrapping station (6) according to one
of claims 6 to 10, characterised in that the tensioning

device is a winding device (20, 21), arranged in
particular on the tearing table (12), for winding up

(1) is unwrapped.
Paper reel unwrapping station (6) according to
claim 10, characterised in that the tearing table (12)
