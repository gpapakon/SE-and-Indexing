<ABSTRACT>
A drilling device with a radially elastic shaft (3) allowing a radial deflection of the drilling head (5) is proposed. The radial deflection can be brought about by means of a vibrating device (8), but a self-excited oscillation of the shaft (3) can also bring about the desired radial deflection in the region of the drilling head (5). Instead of a radial deflection of the drilling head (5) during the drilling operation, a plate (10), in which a cylindrical bore is to be made, can also be set in oscillations which are radial relative to the drilling axis.

<CLAIMS>
Drilling device for producing undercut drilled holes in facing panels,
consisting of a drill bit chuck (23) driven by a drill shank (2) and

from which a drill bit (4) having a front end abrasive face (6)
projects axially, wherein the drill bit (4) is arranged to be displaced

radially with respect to the centre line of the drill shank (2) to
produce the undercut at the bottom of the drilled hole, and wherein

the drill bit chuck (23) is secured to the drill shank (2) by way of a
resilient shaft (3) serving as the resilient bearing element,

characterized in that the resilient shaft (3) lies in a damping
chamber (18), filled with a damping agent (19), of a sleeve-shaped

shank extension.
A drilling device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
damping chamber (18) is sealed with respect to the outside by

means of a radially resilient seal (21) surrounding the resilient shaft
(3).
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a vibration device (8) causes the drill bit chuck

(23) to oscillate radially.
A drilling device according to claim 3, characterized in that the
vibration device (8) is an electromagnet (24), the magnetic field of

which is pulsed, acting in the region of the drill bit chuck (23) or the
resilient shaft (3).
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a stop element (22) which limits the radial 

displacement of the shaft (3) is mounted on the resilient shaft (3).
A drilling device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the shank extension (17) is mounted in a radial bearing (20).
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the drill bit (4) has a drill head (5) widening

towards the front end abrasive face (6), and the abrasive face (6) is
inclined or is stepped asymmetrically with respect to the centre line

of drilling.
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the panel (10) lies on an oscillating table (11),

which is caused to oscillate horizontally by means of a vibration
device (13).
