<ABSTRACT>
Optical apparatus having first (12) and second (14) 
lens groups moveable along an optical axis, and a cam (50) 

and follower (52) mechanism for communicating relative axial 
displacement to said second lens group in response to 

axial movement of said first lens group for changing 
the focal length of the optical system. The cam and 

follower mechanism is characterized by a plurality of 
cam steps (54,56) each having first or dwell means (58) for 

maintaining said relative axial displacement constant 
in response to axial movement of said first lens group, 

to accommodate focusing between at least two focus 
positions at a fixed focal length, and second or ramp 

means (60) for changing said relative axial displacement in 
response to axial movement of said first lens group, 

for changing the focal length of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned U.S. Patent
Application Serial No.08/024,132, filed concurrently
herewith in the names of William L. Burnam and Ralph M.
Lyon and Michael J. Poccia, and entitled "CONTROL FOR
OPTICAL SYSTEM HAVING MULTIPLE FOCAL LENGTHS now U.S.
Patent No. 5,349,476.The present invention relates to the field of
photography and is directed to optical apparatus for
varying the focal length and adjusting the focus of a
multi-focal lens system.Modern cameras frequently include optical
systems, sometimes called zoom lenses, having multiple
or infinitely variable focal lengths ranging from wide-angle
to telephoto. It is common in such optical
systems to include lens groups that are moveable
relative to each other along the optical axis to change
the focal length of the system. When the focal length
is changed, it is desirable at the same time to
maintain focus throughout the entire range of focal
lengths. This adjustment usually is accomplished by
moving the optical elements relative to the film or
other imaging plane.There are many techniques for controlling the
movement of optical elements in a zoom lens system to
maintain focus while also providing for multiple or
infinitely variable focal lengths. One such technique
is illustrated in US-A-4,971,427, 
US-A-4,971,427 discloses a camera
having front and back lens groups and a bell crank
coupled therebetween to vary the inter-group spacing
and thereby change the focal length. Both lens groups
are retained in a lens barrel that is movable along an
optical axis relative to the film plane. Movement of
the lens barrel causes the bell crank to engage and
follow a cam plate that rotates the bell crank and
shifts the back lens group along the optical axis
relative to the front lens group.Another technique is disclosed in
US-A-4,391,496.
According to the US-A-4,391,496
disclosure, an elbow linkage couples first and second
lens groups in a pancratic objective system. The
linkage includes a cam follower at the elbow for
engaging and following a cam surface so that axial
movement of the first lens group extends or contracts
the linkage, changing the distance between the lens
groups and the system focal length.EP-A-0 355 640 discloses a camera with a zoom lens in which an outer lens
barrel is positioned axially using a lead screw and nut; a rear lens unit is
positioned axially within the lens barrel using a stepped cam barrel, to change the
focal length of the zoom lens; and a front lens unit is positioned within the lens
barrel using mating helical

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) having first (12) and second (14) lens groups moveable along
an optical axis (X) and a cam (50) and follower (66, 68) mechanism for communicating

relative axial displacement to said second lens group in response to
axial movement of said first lens group, thereby changing a focal length of said

apparatus;

said cam (50) including a plurality of cam steps (54, 56; 62,
64), each cam step having a first, dwell surface (58) for maintaining constant

said relative axial displacement between said first and second lens groups
during axial movement of said first lens group to focus the apparatus at a given

focal length, and a second, cam surface (58) for changing said relative axial
displacement between said first and second lens groups in response to axial

movement of said first lens group to change said focal length, characterized in
that:


said plurality of cam steps (54, 56, 62, 64) are arranged in opposed pairs
along the opposed sides of the cam (50), so that each cam side includes

dwell surfaces (58) extending parallel to each other and
said optical axis (X) connected by cam surfaces extending at angles

relative to each other and said optical axis (X); and
the follower (66, 68) includes a first link (68) having one end
coupled to said first lens group and the other end movable along one of said opposed sides of the

cam and a second link (66) having one end coupled to
said second lens group (14) and the other

end movable along the other side of the cam,
and a floating pivot (80) connecting said first and second

links (66, 68) in a center section thereof.
Apparatus as defined in Claim 1 wherein said cam and follower accommodates axial movement of said
first and second lens groups (12, 14) to permit focusing of said apparatus between

at least two focus positions at said given focal length.
Apparatus as defined in Claim 1, wherein each of said first, dwell surfaces defines
a discrete focal length for said apparatus, and a motor

driven mechanism (42, 44, 46) is provided for moving said first lens group (12) to fix said
focal length at one of said discrete focal lengths.
