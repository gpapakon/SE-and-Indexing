<ABSTRACT>
A ported vacuum drum (20, 56-98) is provided on its exterior cylindrical 
surface (22) with one or more lengths (24) of a master magnetic recording medium 

supported by bands (102) of elastomeric material in position to contact a layer (14) 
of slave magnetic recording medium provided on one side and along at least one 

edge of a web (10); so that, vacuum applied (74-82) between the cylindrical 
surface and the web at locations (88-94) spaced from the zone of contact (98) 

between the recording media will hold the slave layer on the web securely in 
contact with the length of master magnetic recording medium on the drum as the 

drum rotates, thereby permitting anhysteretic recording from the master to the 
slave. A method of anhysteretically recording is taught.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns transferring recorded information from one
magnetic medium to another. More particularly, the invention concerns apparatus
and methods for anhysteretically recording from a high coercivity master medium
carried on a rotatable, circular cylindrical drum to a lower coercivity slave medium
carried on a web of indeterminate length wrapped on the drum; so that, information
previously recorded on the master medium is recorded repeatedly along the length
of the slave medium as the cylindrical drum rotates and the web translates in
contact with a portion of the cylindrical drum.Conventional magnetic recording requires a stationary recording head
which makes contact with a moving surface of a magnetic medium, which may be
in web, disk or drum form. Because of the tendency of such heads to abrade the
magnetic medium, at least the surface layer of the magnetic medium generally is
made from a durable material selected to resist abrasion. In recent years,
photographic films have been developed which include on one side of a base
material, various layers of photosensitive materials; and on the other side, a thin,
virtually transparent layer of magnetic medium. The magnetic medium can be
used, for example, during manufacture of the film to record information related to
the film's characteristics; during use of the film in the camera to enable the camera
to read and adjust itself in response to previously recorded information, or to
record information about camera settings and scene characteristics, or both; and
during processing or developing of the film to enable the processing equipment to
read previously recorded information and adjust the processing parameters
accordingly. However, because of the presence of the magnetic medium in a
photographic film, the properties of the surface layer of the magnetic medium are
chosen more for their photographic suitabilities than for their resistance to the sort
of abrasion which can occur due to contact with a stationary recording head in a
conventional recording process. Any abrasion on the film surface must be avoided
since it would degrade the optical properties of the film and thereby prevent 
capture and reproduction of high quality images. As a result, if conventional
recording apparatus were used to record to the magnetic recording medium on
such a film, there would be a danger that the magnetic medium would be damaged
due to abrasion. Use of a contact head is acceptable in a camera due to the low
speed of recording and reading but would not be
