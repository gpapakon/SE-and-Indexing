<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver circuit particularly suitable for use in 
applications such as remote control, includes a SAW 

filter (106) as the sole frequency sensitive element 
which bandpass-filters a received high-frequency signal. 

This bandpass-filtered signal is multiplied with a signal 
from an oscillator (112) at a frequency which is greater 

than half the bandwidth of the filter. Thus, the energy 
of the high-frequency signal is dispersed into sidebands 

about the filter's centre frequency which lie outside the 
filter's passband, so that sensitivity to undesired 

coupling of the multiplied signal through the filter is 
decreased. The circuitry apart from the SAW filter may 

be fabricated as a single integrated circuit (118) 
requiring the minimum of external components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radio receiver circuits 
and particularly, though not exclusively, to simple high-frequency 
radio receiver circuits such as may be used in 
remote control applications. In applications such as remote control, there is a 
need for simple high-frequency radio receiver circuits. 
To minimise the size and cost, it is preferable that such 
a receiver be produced as an integrated circuit with a 
minimum of external components. The development in 
recent years of high-frequency surface acoustic wave 
(SAW) filters allows the necessary selectivity to be 
obtained from such a filter operating at the signal 
frequency. A simple receiver could therefore employ such 
a filter as the sole frequency selective element, with an 
integrated circuit providing gain, demodulation and 
subsequent processing operations on the demodulated 
signal. However, the difficulty in implementing such a 
receiver is that the gain required from the receiver 
input to the demodulator may be very high, and undesired 
coupling from the demodulator drive circuits to the input 
may cause instability. There is therefore a need for a receiver which can 
employ a SAW filter as the frequency selective element, 
and which has reduced sensitivity to undesired coupling 
from the high signal level circuits to the input.  In accordance the present invention there is 
provided a radio receiver circuit comprising:
 
   filter means coupled to receive an input signal 
having a first frequency and having a predetermined 
passband bandwidth so as to pass a filtered signal 
having only a predetermined band of frequencies 
centred on the first frequency;
 
   oscillator means for providing an oscillator signal 
at a second frequency which is greater than half the 
bandwidth of the filter means;
 
   multiplier means coupled to receive the filtered 
signal from the filter means and the oscillator 
signal from the oscillator means and for producing a 
multiplied signal therefrom; and
 
   demodulator means coupled to receive the multiplied 
signal and to demodulate therefrom desired 
information,
 
   whereby the multiplied signal has components whose 
frequencies which lie outside the passband of the 
filter means such that sensitivity to undesired 
coupling of the multiplied signal through the filter 
means is decreased. It will be understood that such a circuit may 
utilise a SAW as the filter means for the sole frequency 
selective element, the remaining circuitry being 
fabricated as a single integrated circuit requiring the
