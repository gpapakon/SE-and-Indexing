<ABSTRACT>
A means and method of describing a complex color raster image as a collection of 
objects in a hierarchical and device independent format. The purpose of structured imaging (SI) is 

to expand the scope of a raster image to a collection of individually manipulable component 
objects. An SI is a hierarchical description of a single output image raster which may be 
used as 
one component of a page in a structured document. Objects contributing to the output raster 

may originate from text, graphics, other rasters or a combination thereof, and all maintain their 
heritage for selectability and modification. The SI describes not only the source data but also the 

image processing operations required for rendering the output raster. SI technology supports re-editability, 
customization and enhancement, automatic image assembly and high performance 

imaging. Thus, such a model has implications not only in an image editing and processing arena, 
but also in the filing and printing services used for image handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processor/generator for representing a complex
color raster image as a collection of objects in a hierarchical and device independent format and,
more particularly, to a structured image (SI) format that includes not only source data, but also the
image processing operations required for rendering them and supports re-editability,
customization and enhancement, automatic image assembly, and high performance imaging
using an appropriate user interface.Commercially available packages in use today require considerable memory to
operate. For example, Adobe Photoshop® stores three copies of the full size raster during
interactive editing. Thus, a typical 24-bit color image (216x279mm at 12 dots per mm (8½ x 11
inches at 300 dpi)) can require 24 megabytes of memory for each image copy.Further, commercial software often exhibits sluggish to poor performance when
editing large imagery. Again, Photoshop® must store, as discussed above, three copies of the
image (no matter how large it is). Since every interactive operation processes the full image,
performance is extremely slow.Additionally, typical commercial software stores output imagery as complete rasters.
Therefore, for each new version of an image, a complete raster must be written out and you
cannot undo the operations contained in those versions. At 24 megabytes per image, as discussed
above, disk requirements can be extensive. Also, archiving such imagery can require extensive
storage space as well.Further, a critical need exists for an image processor in the commercial printing arena
with the ability to create a job template for constructing multiple, customized images. Few, if any,
commercial image processing packages exist that will allow the creation of such job application
templates. Additionally, commercial image processing software packages, such as Photoshop®,
have limited ability to render the output image optimized for the output device. Typically, color
correction and simple resolution conversion is all that may be applied.Additionally, in typical commercial image processing software, the ability to edit the
list of image processing operations performed by the operator is also very limited. For example,
Photoshop® allows only one undo operation. Also, typical commercial software does not allow for
the optimization of image processing. That is, once an image is created, the ability to combine
operations and increase performance on high resolution imagery is lost.Finally, there exists a strong industry
