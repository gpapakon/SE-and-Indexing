<ABSTRACT>
A three-position actuator assembly for selectively shifting a three-speed 
splitter type auxiliary transmission section (14) is provided. The actuator assembly 

includes a piston portion (160) for axially moving a selected one of two shift forks 
(142/148) and a pneumatic control circuit (162) comprising three three-way, two-position 

solenoid controlled valves (202/204/206) and two three-way shuttle valves (214/216). 
Only one solenoid is energized for each selectable actuator position and a failure of the 

pneumatic (200) or electrical power sources to the control circuit will not cause the 
actuator to shift out of an engaged ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically 
controlled, pressurized fluid actuated, three-position 
actuator and, in particular, relates to a solenoid controlled 
pneumatic actuator for selectively causing engagement of a 
selected one of three selectable auxiliary section ratio gears 
in a vehicular compound mechanical transmission. Compound mechanical transmissions having three-speed 
auxiliary sections, usually splitter type auxiliary sections, 
connected in series with a multiple speed main transmission 
section are well known in the prior art. An example of this 
type of transmission is sold by Eaton Corporation and its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Eaton Limited, under the trademark 
"TwinSplitter" and is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 
4,736,643. Shifting actuators for such transmissions typically 
comprise a first shift fork controlled by a first, three-position 
piston having a centered nonengagement position and 
selectably displaceable in both axle directions to two 
selectable engagement positions and a second shift fork 
controlled by a second, two-position piston having a 
nondisplaced nonengagement position and selectably displaced 
to a single engaged position. An interlock assembly is 
provided to assure that only one shift fork is displaced from 
its nonengaged position at any given time. Actuator piston 
assemblies of this type may be seen by reference to U.S. 
Patent No. 4,748,863. Another shift actuator is described in GB-A-2 108 603, in 
which the shift actuators comprise shift forks attached to 
shift rods. The rods are accommodated in bores of housings, 
said bores having different diameters and being concentrically 
arranged and having positive interlock mechanisms to prevent 
simultaneous displacement of two or more rods.  
 In another known prior art system such as that described 
in EP-A-0 305 750, which corresponds to the pre-characterizing portion of claim 1, a control system is described which permits 
preselection of an auxiliary section gear ratio. The control 
system operates pneumatically and includes operator actuated 
selector valves for selectively pressurizing fluid conduits 
directly connected to remote actuator assemblies. The prior art devices, while providing their intended 
functions, were not totally satisfactory as they usually 
included differential area pistons which, for a given size of  
 
actuator, reduces the force available for some shifts which 
may be especially objectionable during cold start up 
conditions and usually included and air control
