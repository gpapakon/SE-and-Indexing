<ABSTRACT>
Press (1) for extruding nonferrous alloys, including a 
presser element (2) which has, at one of its ends, a 

presser mandrel (8) facing an extrusion head (3). The 
presser element is movable by command towards or away from 

the extrusion head to extrude, through the extrusion head, 
a billet (9) of material which is interposed between the 

presser mandrel and the extrusion head. A seat (10) for 
accommodating the presser mandrel is provided in the 

presser element starting from its end directed towards the 
extrusion head, and the mandrel can move with respect to 

the presser element to be at least partially accommodated 
inside the presser element during the movement of the 

presser element away from the extrusion head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved press for 
extruding nonferrous alloys, which features a reduced 
stroke. Presses are known for extruding nonferrous alloys, 
such as for example aluminum-based light alloys, to form 
profiles that can be used to manufacture fixed and moving 
frames for door- and window-frames or other uses; said 
presses generally comprise a presser element one end 
whereof faces an extrusion head in which the die for 
obtaining the desired shape of the extruded element is 
arranged. The presser element is usually constituted by a 
hydraulic cylinder inside which a piston can slide; one end 
of said piston protrudes from the body of the cylinder on 
the side directed towards the extrusion head. A presser 
mandrel is associated with said end of the piston and, by 
actuating the hydraulic cylinder, acts on a billet of 
material to be extruded, pushing it through the extrusion 
head and thus performing the actual extrusion. Usually the 
extrusion head has, upstream of the die, a container for 
the billet of material to be extruded which can move with 
respect to the die along the extrusion direction so as to 
allow the passage, between the container and the die, of a 
blade for cutting the tailing that remains inside the 
container at the end of the extrusion operation. In 
practice, conventional extrusion presses work according to 
a cycle entailing the placement of the billet of material 
to be extruded between the presser mandrel and the 
extrusion head with the subsequent advancement of the 
presser mandrel towards the extrusion head so as to move  
 
the billet of material to be extruded into the container. 
Then the further advancement of the presser mandrel 
produces the actual extrusion of the billet through the die 
of the extrusion head, and when extrusion is completed the 
mandrel is retracted again while the container is moved 
away from the remaining part of the extrusion head to allow 
to cut the tailing from the extruded part and remove it 
from the extrusion head. During this step the presser 
mandrel must perform a considerable stroke, since it must 
protrude from the container and must move away therefrom 
along the extrusion direction, which is opposite to the 
advancement direction, thereby allowing the placement of a 
new billet to be extruded between the container and the end 
of the presser mandrel that is directed towards the 
extrusion head. Due to the considerable stroke of the 
mandrel in this step, in conventional presses there are 
long downtimes

<CLAIMS>
Press (1) for extruding nonferrous alloys, 
comprising a presser element (2) having, at one of its 

ends, a presser mandrel (8) which faces an extrusion head 
(3), said presser element being movable by command towards 

or away from said extrusion head to extrude, through said 
extrusion head, a billet (9) of material which is 

interposed between said presser mandrel and said extrusion 
head, characterized in that a seat (10) for accommodating 

said presser mandrel is provided in said presser element 
starting from its end directed towards said extrusion head, 

and in that said presser mandrel can move with respect to 
said presser element to be at least partially accommodated 

inside said presser element during the movement of said 
presser element away from said extrusion head. 
Press according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said presser element comprises the main piston (11) of a 

hydraulic cylinder (12), said main piston being slideable 
by command along its axis (12a) and facing, with one of its 

ends, said extrusion head; said accommodation seat (10) 
being formed inside said main piston starting from said end 

which is directed towards the extrusion head. 
Press according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said presser mandrel is 

mounted on a support (19) slideable by command in said 
accommodation seat along a direction which is substantially 

parallel to the sliding direction of said main piston with 
respect to the body of said hydraulic cylinder. 
Press according to one or more of the preceding 
 

claims, characterized in that said support is shaped like 
the piston of a hydraulic cylinder of the type with an 

internal cylinder, wherein said internal cylinder is 
constituted by a protrusion (30) that extends from the 

bottom of said seat and slidingly couples inside a 
cylindrical chamber (32) formed in said support, said 

cylindrical chamber being divided into two half-chambers by 
a cylindrical expansion (31) of said protrusion, said two 

half-chambers being selectively connectable to a source of 
pressurized fluid or to a discharge for the movement of 

said support in said sliding seat with respect to said main 
piston. 
Press according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises locking means 

(20-22) that can be activated by command for locking the
