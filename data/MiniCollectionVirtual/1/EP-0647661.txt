<ABSTRACT>
Chromium catalyst composition are provided. These chromium 
catalyst compositions comprise at least two chromium catalyst systems 

that have a certain amount of chromium and a support that comprises 
silica and titania. the supports have certain pore volumes and surface 

areas. These catalyst compositions are useful for homopolymerizing 
ethylene or copolymerizing ethylene with a comonomer. The resins 

produced are useful in film applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to the field of chromium catalyst compositions. This invention is also related to the fields
of polymerizing ethylene, or copolymerizing ethylene and a comonomer, with a chromium catalyst composition.The high molecular weight-high density ethylene polymer film market, in the U.S., is dominated by multicomponent
ethylene polymers (colloquially referred to as "bimodal" or "multimodal" polymers) that are produced by mixtures of
titanium halide catalysts. These multicomponent ethylene polymers offer good impact resistance and thus, good down
gauging capability, along with a high modulus. The advent of these multicomponent ethylene polymers has opened up
markets previously covered by other materials such as paper, thicker gauge ethylene polymers, and lower density
ethylene polymers. However, these multicomponent ethylene polymers are produced commercially using cascade
reactor systems in which two reactors are linked in series so that a two stage polymerization can take place with
different polymerization conditions in each reactor. This is a more expensive production method than a single stage
reactor system.WO-A-9 217 511 discloses a chromium catalyst composition which comprises a first and second silica-supported
chromium catalyst component, wherein at least one of said catalyst components contains an additional element, i.a.,
titanium, which is deposited on the support. This support is different to a support which comprises silica and titania and is formed from a silica-titania cogel.In order to compete with these multicomponent ethylene polymers it is important for a resin to have good impact
strength, tear resistance in the transverse direction, appearance, and processing behavior. To date, chromium catalysts
have not been competitive in the high molecular weight-high density ethylene polymer film market. For example, one
chromium catalyst may produce a resin that has good film properties, but poor bubble stability at high production rates
and thin gauges. On the other hand, another chromium catalyst may produce a resin that has a good bubble stability
at high production rates and thin gauges, but poor film properties. However, making a chromium catalyst that produces
an high molecular weight-high density ethylene polymer film resin that has good film properties and good bubble stability
at high production rates and thin gauges has, until this invention, not been accomplished.It is an object of this invention to provide chromium catalyst compositions.It is another object of
