<ABSTRACT>
The process for manufacturing a complete garment on a two 
needle bed flat knitting machine, which operates with latch 

needles, which process consist of the fact that at least at 
the beginning of the manufacture of the garment, half of the 

needles (A,B) of the front needle bed are put to work with the 
empty (idle) needles (1,2) of the rear needle bed and viceversa 

in order to perform, during the steps of forming of the 
tubular portions of said garment, also an operation of 

narrowing of the knitted product in pre-established areas 
of said tubular portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for making a 
complete garment on a (straight bar) flat knitting machine 
having two needle beds and latch needles. It is well known in the art that the two needle bed 
machines having a front and a rear needle bed and latch 
needles are normally capable of fashioning the different 
parts of a garment which will be thereafter linked among 
each other by a sewing operation. Accordingly the manufacture for instance of a pullover 
consists of forming on a knitting machine of this kind the 
different parts which form the pullover (front part, rear 
part, sleeves, etc.); and, at a second point in time, of 
linking the different parts by means of a looping operation. The above way of proceeding implies, as is easy to 
understand, the performance of an additional operation, 
which is carried out in an independent step with respect to 
the operation which is performed by the flat knitting 
machine, after the different parts of the garments have been 
manufactured on the same. This fact brings about an increase of the costs of 
manufacturing of the garment due both to the lengthier time 
which is needed in order to fulfill it and to further 
intervention of specialized manpower. The problem which the present invention proposes to 
solve consists of the elimination of the above 
inconveniences, by devising a process for the manufacture of 
a complete garment on a two needle beds, knitting machines 
using latch needles, which permits to eliminate the  
 
operation of the sewing or of the looping of the different 
parts which form the garment. Within the scope of this solution, an important object 
of the invention is the devising of a process which permits 
to obtain a complete garment which appears to offer better 
aesthetical appearance with respect to the conventional 
garments since it does not show any sewing of the different 
parts which make the garment itself. Not a least object of the invention is to devise a 
process for manufacturing a complete garment which implies a 
very restricted cost which is surely lower than the cost of 
the garments manufactured with conventional methods. The above solution and the above objects are reached 
by a process for manufacturing a complete garment on a two 
needle beds, knitting machine using latch needles, 
characterized in that at least at the beginning of the 
manufacture of the garment, half of the needles of the front 
needle bed are put to work with the empty (idle) needles of 
the rear needle bed and viceversa in order

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing a complete garment on a 
two needle bed, knitting machine with latch needles, 

characterized in that at least at the beginning of the 
manufacture of the garment, half of the needles of the front 

needle bed are put to work with the empty needles of the 
rear needle bed and viceversa in order to perform, during 

the steps of forming of the tubular portions of said 
garment, also an operation of narrowing of the knitted 

product in pre-established area of said tubular portions. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the number of the needles preset to work on the front needle 

bed is the same as the number of the needles pre-set to work 
of said rear needle bed. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
at least an area of said tubular portions of said garment is 

knitted by rib knitting. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said operation of narrowing consists of: using alternate 

needles of said front and rear needle beds, so that at each 
needle put to work of the front needle bed corresponds an 

empty needle of the rear needle bed, and viceversa; 
transferring, in an initial step, the needles (2) pre-set to 

be put work of the rear needle bed on the front needle bed, 
thereafter transferring the needles (2 and "B") preset to be 

put to work from said front needle bed on the rear needle 
bed providing for the displacement towards the right or the 

left hand side of said rear needle bed, according to the 
need, of a pre-established number of needles; and in 

displacing the needles ("B") of said rear needle bed on said 
 

front needle bed so as to obtain on said front and rear 
needle beds the same needles (1, 2 and "A" and "B" put to 

work and empty) of the initial position, but displaced 
towards the right hand direction or the left hand direction 

of a pre-established number of needles. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said displacement towards the right and the left hand 

directions of said needles is subject to the kind of 
narrowing of the knitwear which is desired to be obtained on 

said garment. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said rib knitting consists, after having performed a 

threading operation, of using a first needle (1) and a 
second needle (2) and a further needle ("B") pre-set to be 

put at work on the rear needle bed providing to leave an 
empty needle between said first needle (1) and said second 

needle (2) and of using on the front needle bed a still 
further needle ("A") pre-set to be put at work followed by 

two empty needles, of transferring said needles (2 and "B") 
from the rear needle bed to the front needle bed; of working 

by said first needle (1) the knitwear on said rear needle 
bed and simultaneously by said second needle (2) the 

knitwear on said front needle bed; and of transferring said 
needles (2 and "B") from said front needle bed to said rear 

needle bed to return again in an initial position in order 
to perform said threading operation. 
Garment obtained according to the process of claim 
1, characterized in that no sewing is provided between its 

different portions.
