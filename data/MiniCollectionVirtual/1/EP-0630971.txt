<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods and reagents for
identifying and co-detecting the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae ("N.
gonorrhoeae" the causative agent of gonorrhea) and Chlamydia trachomatis.Gonorrhea is one of the most commonly reported bacterial infection
in the United States. Over 3 million cases are reported annually. See
Morello et al., "Neisseria and Branhamella", Manual of Clinical
Microbiology (5th Ed. 1991), pp. 258-276.In order to treat successfully a disease caused by a bacterium, for
example Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the rapid and accurate detection and
identification of the disease-causing bacterium is required. The detection
and identification has traditionally been accomplished by pure culture
isolation and determination procedures that make use of knowledge of
specimen source, growth requirements, visible (colony) growth features,
microscopic morphology, staining reactions, and biochemical
characteristics.Conventional methods of detecting and identifying the causative
agent of gonorrhea, N. gonorrhoeae, include the Gram-stain, culturing
on selective agar medium, and cytochrome oxidase and carbohydrate
utilization testing. Serological assays, including coagglutination and
fluorescent antibody staining have also been described for the detection of
N. gonorrhoeae. See, Morello et al., supra. Recently, the use of DNA
probes for the diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae has also been reported by
Morello et al., supra. The Gram-stain and antibody-based tests are rapid
(<1 hour), but of low sensitivity (requiring at least 104 CFU (colony 
forming units) bacteria per ml). Culture methods, while sensitive to
approximately 2 CFU per ml, require overnight incubation.The use of specific polynucleotide sequences as probes for the
recognition of infectious agents is becoming a valuable alternative to
problematic immunological identification assays. For example, PCT
publication WO84/02721, published 19 July 1984 describes the use of
nucleic acid probes complementary to targeted nucleic acid sequences
composed of ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, or other RNA in
hybridization procedures to detect the target nucleic acid sequence.
Analogously, Miyada, C.G. and Born, T.L. (1991), Molecular and Cellular
Probes 5: 327-35, used probes to detect N. gonorrhoeae. While the assay
may provide greater sensitivity and specificity than known DNA
hybridization assays, hybridization procedures which require the use of a
complementary probe are generally dependent upon the cultivation
and/or enrichment of a test

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining the presence or absence of
N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis in a fluid sample

suspected of containing either or both N. gonorrhoeae and
C. trachomatis, comprising:


(a) treating said sample with an aqueous solution which
contains four primers: two of the primers are capable of

hybridizing to N. gonorrhoeae and have the nucleotide sequences
SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2; and two other primers are

capable of hybridizing uniquely to C. trachomatis and have the
sequences of SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5, said aqueous

solution containing an inert organic polar solvent as a
cosolvent;
(b) synthesizing an extension product of each of said
primers, which extension product(s) contain(s) the target DNA

sequence(s), and amplifying said target sequence(s) if present;
(c) treating said sample, after the intended
amplification(s), with two oligonucleotide probes, each of

which contains at least fourteen nucleotides: one probe
containing a sequence uniquely complementary to a sequence in

the amplified region of N. gonorrhoeae, and a second probe
containing a sequence uniquely complementary to a sequence in

the amplified region of C. trachomatis;
(d) incubating the amplified target region(s), if any,
with each of the oligonucleotide probes, under stringent

conditions, and allowing for hybridization between each of said
probes and the target region for said probe; and 
(e) detecting hybrids formed between the amplified target..
region(s), if any, and the oligonucleotide probe(s).
The method of claim 1, wherein Step (d) is carried out in
the presence of a buffer.
The method of claim 2, wherein the buffer comprises NaSCN
at a concentration of about 4.0 M.
A composition for the co-amplification of N. gonorrhoeae
and C. trachomatis sequences in a biological sample comprising

an aqueous solution containing the primers specific for
N. gonorrhoeae having the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID

NO: 2 and the primers specific for C. trachomatis having the
sequences of SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5, and said solution

containing as a cosolvent an inert organic polar solvent.
The composition of claim 4, wherein the solution contains
from 1% to 20% by volume of said cosolvent.
A PCR kit for the detection of either or both
N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, comprising a container

having an aqueous solution which includes oligonucleotide
primers having sequences SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID

NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5, said aqueous solution further
containing as a cosolvent an organic polar solvent; and

separate from said container, an oligonucleotide probe for
N. gonorrhoeae having sequence SEQ ID NO: 3 and a probe for

C. trachomatis having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 6.
The kit of claim 6, wherein the probes are immobilized on a
microtiter plate.
The kit of claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the oligonucleotide
primers are labeled. 
The kit of claim 8, wherein the primers are labeled with
biotin.
