<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing glyoxylic acid by electrochemical reduction of oxalic acid in an aqueous solution within divided or non-divided electrolytic cells. The cathode is composed of carbon or of at least 50 % by weight of at least one of the metals Cu, Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Al, Sn and Cr. The aqueous electrolytic solution in the non-divided cells or in the cathode chamber of divided cells further contains at least one salt of metals having at least 0.25 V hydrogen overvoltage, with respect to 2500 A/m
