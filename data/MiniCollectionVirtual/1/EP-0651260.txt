<ABSTRACT>
A machine and relative press assembly for electrically testing a printed circuit board, 
comprising a frame (1) supporting a press with parallel planes, said press having a 

printed circuit loading area (3), a test area (4) and a parking area (5) for the upper head 
of the press, as well as means for moving said head (100) from the test area (4) to the 

parking area (5) and vice versa, to allow manual loading of the circuits to be tested 
directly in the test area (4) and means for moving the circuit boards from the loading area 

(3) to the test area (4) and vice versa, in the case of automatic or semi-automatic 
loading, thus creating two distinct work sections that can be used selectively by a single 

operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for electrically
testing at least one side of a printed circuit board.As is known, the machines that allow electrical testing of printed circuit boards can be
automatic or manual. Generally speaking, the automatic machines are composed of a
press, which has a loading area and a test area, into which the board to be tested is
transferred by a conveyor or carrier. Such an automatic machine is known
from US-A-5 094 584, which discloses the prior art portion of
claim 1.If carriers are used a mask has to be made on them for conveying the board, and
consequently it is necessary to construct further elements, whose cost has to be added to
that of the adapter which is always present in any case, this being the element that
permits translation between the points of the board being tested and the fixed pitch
electrical contact area provided at the level of the press with parallel surfaces.This means that in many cases, for example when the number of boards to be tested is
limited, the cost of the mask cannot be justified.In these cases it is therefore advantageous to use manual machines, in which the
operator manually positions the printed circuit board in the test area and operates the
press to carry out the test.During error identification, the possibility of operating directly on the test surface is an
undeniable advantage in that it saves time and facilitates the work.In other words, the automatic machines currently available on the market have
considerable operating limits and are not versatile. The aim of the invention is to overcome the drawbacks described above, by providing a
machine to carry out the electrical test on only one side of a printed circuit board, or
simultaneously on both sides, which affords the possibility of obtaining two perfectly
identical work stations, although the machine has only one operator.A further aim of the invention is to provide a test machine for printed circuit boards
that is able to offer the fullest guarantees of reliability and safety in use.The machine for performing the electrical test on at least one side of a printed circuit
board according to the invention has the characteristics described in the appended
claims. In particular the machine comprises a frame supporting a press with parallel
surfaces, said frame having a loading area, a test area and a press head parking area. In
addition, means are provided for moving the head from the test area to the parking area,
in order to create two distinct workstations, that can be

<CLAIMS>
A machine for electrically testing at least one side of a printed circuit board
(200), comprising a frame (1) supporting a press (2) with parallel surfaces, that acts on

the circuit (200) to carry out the test on it, and a press head (100), said frame having a loading area (3) and a test area (4) and means for
automatically transferring the circuits from the loading area (3) to the test area (4) and

vice versa, 
characterized by
 the fact that said frame (1)
has a parking area (5) for the press head (100),

means for moving said head (100) from the test area (4) to the parking area and vice
versa, to allow manual loading of the circuit boards (200) in the test area thus creating two distinct work stations, one at said loading area (3) and the

other at said test are (4), that can be used selectively by a single operator.
A machine according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 the fact that said loading area
(3) and test area (4) are situated at the two ends of said frame (1), while said parking

area (5) is situated in the central part of the frame.
A machine according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 the fact that said parking area
(5) is situated in a raised position with respect to said test area (4).
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by
 the fact that said means
for moving the head (100) from the test area (4) to the parking area (5) and vice versa

operate by translation and comprise a linear actuator (13) that acts on the head (100)
through interposition of a spring cartridge (106), mechanical stops (105) being provided

to halt the head (100) in the test position.
A machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the
fact that said head (100) can be moved vertically on columns (101).
A machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the
fact that said means for transferring the printed circuit boards (200) from the loading

area (3) to the test area (4) and vice versa comprise a pair of rails (130), on which the
circuits (200) travel in opposite directions moving on two parallel planes one above the

other, so that while one circuit is transferred to the test area, another circuit that has
already been tested is transferred to the loading area. 
A machine according to claim 6, 
characterized by
 the fact that said rails (130)
accommodate and guide an elastic belt conveyor system (125), on which carriers (120,

121) designed to support the respective printed circuits (200) rest without any
constraint, disposed one above the other, stops (140, 141) being provided to halt the

carriers (120, 121) in the loading area (3) and the test area (4), respectively.
A machine according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized by
 the fact that said rails
(130) are of an adjustable height and they comprise a fixed section (131) in the loading

area and a vertically mobile section (132) in the test area (4), the two sections (131, 132)
being connected to each other by means of an articulated parallelogram (135) that

ensures that they are parallel.
A machine according to claim 8, 
characterized by
 the fact that said vertically
mobile section (132) of the rail (130) is operated by a pressure element (150) that is

adjustable on screws (151) and is integral with the upper head (100) of the press.
