<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a herbicidal preparation, 
preferably in the form of a concentrate, containing 
at least one herbicide suspended in a finely 
ground form in a liquid, oily phase and selected from 
the group consisting of phenmedipham, ethofumesate and 
metamitron, wherein the total amount of the three herbicides 
constitutes from 1 to 50% by weight, 4 to 85% 
by weight of oil, further one or more emulsifier components 
in an amount of 1 to 40% and possibly water and 
possibly a filler, and a polymeric stabilizer in an 
amount of 0.03 to 25% selected from a group of polymers 
all of which have a molecular weight of at least 7.000 
Dalton, all of which are solids at 60°C and which preferably 
by a dilatation by themselves at 20°C are stably 
admixable (dissoluble) in water. Moreover, the invention relates to analogous 
mixtures ready for use. Solvent-based pesticides for use in agriculture 
are generally marketed as liquid, completely soluble 
concentrates to be diluted with water prior to the 
final use so as to be sprayed on the fields or plants 
by means of conventional spray equipments. During the 
dilution process with water prior to the final use and 
by stirring without particular precautions the dissolved 
pesticide component may migrate from the oily 
phase into the added aqueous phase, the oil being at 
the same time emulsified in the water, thereby forming 
an oil-in-water emulsion. Shelf-life-stable, aqueous suspensions of pesticides 
(flowables) to be diluted with water are being 
increasingly used during recent years. Several environmental 
advantages are connected with products of that 
type. Compared to e.g. dispersable powdery products 
there are no problems with dust and compared to emulsion 
concentrates, in which the pesticide is dissolved  
 
in a solvent that is emulsified in water by means of 
surfactants it is possible to avoid the use of toxic 
and unpleasant solvents. Another known, but not especially widespread 
type of pesticide concentrates is an oily pesticide 
suspension in which the oil may be emulsified in water. 
When such a composition is diluted in water for final 
use, the emulsifier must be capable of distributing the 
oil without forming gels or lumps and distribute the 
pesticide in the aqueous phase. It is important that 
the distribution in the aqueous phase is effected 
rapidly and without difficulties. In view of the fact 
that most of the field crop spray equipments nowadays 
include effective stirring means, it may be accepted 
that a minor separation
