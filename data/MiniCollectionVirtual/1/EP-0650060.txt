<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an evaluation method and an electronic evaluation device for pulses output by an optoelectronic tachometer (revolutions counter, r.p.m. counter, rev counter), which operates in a multi-channel, in particular a two-channel fashion, on the drive motor of a mechanical device, in particular a door-moving mechanism. The pulses have rising and falling edges (leading and trailing edges) and are output staggered in time on the individual channels (A, B), in order to be able to specify the direction of rotation (sense of rotation) of the motor. The speed is measured by a differential time measurement between edges of the output pulses, in particular two successive pulses (period measurement).
