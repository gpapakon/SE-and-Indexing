<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-pot mixer-granulator-dryer, which is a single-stage or single-pot production apparatus for the successive mixing, moist granulating and drying of solid pharmaceutical products, for example in the manufacture of powdery products, pellets or granules. The high effectiveness of the drying is achieved by the simultaneous use of four different drying mechanisms. A further subject-matter of the invention is a process for the successive mixing, moist granulating and drying in the manufacture of solid pharmaceutical products, in particular of pharmaceutical granules, in which the necessary mixing operations, the moist granulating and the following drying operation are carried out in a container (12), and a combination of contact, vacuum, flushing-air and infrared drying by means of an electrically heated ceramic infrared panel radiator (1), arranged outside the dryer, or an electrically heated quartz tube radiator is used for the drying.

Dryer, particularly a one-pot mixer/granulator/ 
dryer for successively mixing, moist granulating and 

drying solid pharmaceutical products, consisting of a 
closeable receiving container (12) with heatable vessel 

walls for contact drying and a container lid (11), the 
container being pivotable up to 90° to the left and 

right about a pivot axis (17) to form a moving bed of 
material to be dried, a rotatable mixing arm suitably 

mounted inside the container (12) for optionally further 
aiding the mixing of the material, consisting of a 

mixing arm shaft (15) with mixing arm vanes (13) mounted 
thereon, a flushing air inlet (14) for flushing air 

drying which leads into the interior of the receiving 
container (12) on the underside thereof, and a vacuum 

connection (9), through which the dryer can be evacuated 
for vacuum drying,which simultaneously serves as an 

outlet for the flushing air, and which is arranged 
opposite on the upper side of the container lid (11), 

characterised in that the dryer additionally has an 
infrared drying component consisting of a window (2) 

integrated in airtight manner in the wall of the 
container lid (11) which is sufficiently permeable to 

infrared radiation, and an infrared radiator (2) mounted 
outside the dryer selected from an electrically heated 

ceramic infrared panel radiator and an electrically 
heated quartz tube radiator (1), which irradiates its 

energy onto the material for drying contained inside the 
dryer through the window (2). 
Dryer according to claim 1, characterised in that 
heating circuits are integrated in the vessel walls of 

the receiving container (12) and container lid (11). 
Dryer according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the flushing air inlet (14) consists of a semi-permeable  

 
porous membrane or is present in the form of suitable 

porous sintered metal inserts. 
Dryer according to claim 1, characterised in that 

the radiator (1) is provided with reflectors of 
smooth-rolled aluminium or silver or gold applied by 

vaporising or provided in a correspondingly thin layer 
to a carrier material, 
between the radiator (1) and window (2), if a 
ceramic infrared panel radiator is used, a reflector 

shutter (3) with pivot mechanism is arranged, 
the surface of the window (2) is cooled by means of 
an air current generated by a cooling fan (4) or suction 

ventilator and 
the surface of the window (2) facing the material 
to be dried is kept free of impurities by means of a 

suitable intermittent air jet flushing device (5). 
Dryer according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the window (2) has a transmittance of more than 60% at 

the wavelength peak of the infrared radiation irradiated 
under the operating conditions. 
Process for successively mixing, moist-granulating 
and drying solid pharmaceutical products, wherein the 

mixing processes required, the moist-granulation and the 
subsequent drying operation, are carried out in a dryer 

which can be sealed in air tight manner according to 
claim 1, and drying is carried out using simultaneously 

a combination of contact, vacuum and flushing air 
drying, characterised in that additionally infrared 

drying is carried out, wherein with the aid of the 
infrared radiator (1) mounted outside the dryer, 

infrared radiation having a wavelength peak adapted to 
the adsorption characteristics of the solvent to be 

dried is irradiated onto the material for drying located 
inside the container (12), through the window (2)  

 
integrated in the wall of the dryer, and the window (2) 

has a transmittance of more than 60% at the wavelength 
peak used for irradiation. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the window (2) has a transmittance of more than 80% at 

the wavelength peak used for irradiation. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that 
infrared radiation having a wavelength peak in the range 

from 1.2 to 6 µm is used to dry out water. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that 

a) the contact drying is effected by the 
introduction of heat through heating circuits integrated 

in the walls of the container (12) and/or the container 
lid (11), the heating medium having a temperature 

between 50 and 80°C, 
b) the vacuum drying is effected by lowering the 
boiling point of the solvent which is to be dried off 

using underpressure, a constant pressure of between 10 
and 200 mbar being established inside the closed 

container (12) through a vacuum connector (9) mounted on 
the container lid (11), and 
c) the flushing air drying being carried out by 
passing a defined current of dry, cleansed and heated 

air throughout the material to be dried, the flushing 
air being introduced into the bed of material for drying 

by means of the underpressure prevailing inside the 
closed container (12), through a flushing air inlet (14) 

mounted on the underside of the container (12) with a 
suitable supply of flushing air at a flow rate of 10000 

to 50000 l/h, this flushing air leaving the container 
(12) through the vacuum connector (9). 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the container (12) is slowly pivoted to the left and  

 
right alternately about a pivot axis (17) in order to 

form an inherently moving bed of material for drying, 
whilst the mixing of the material for drying can 

additionally be promoted by means of a mixing arm slowly 
rotating at intervals inside the container (12).
