<ABSTRACT>
A novel method enabling stretch blow molding in a 
temperature range preferable for polyethylene, capable of 

releasing at a surface temperature suited to both releasing 
of a preform and subsequent stretch blow molding, by 

disconnecting the core die and the preform in advance by the 
use of pressure of gas. 
This is for injection molding a predetermined preform 
by filling an injection mold with molten polyethylene, 

releasing the preform from the cavity die and core die of the 
injection mold while a mouth portion of the preform is held 

by the lip die, and transferring the preform into a blow die 
to stretch blow mold into a hollow molded product of thin 

wall. Gas is forcedly entered into the boundary of the core 
die and the preform, before releasing the preform from the 

injection mold, to isolate the inside wall of the preform 
from the core die. Releasing is effected while the inside of 

the preform is not completely cooled and is still at high 
temperature, and in a temperature range in which the surface 

temperature of the preform right after releasing is 80 to 90 
deg. C. The step of stretch blow molding is performed within 

the time interval before the surface temperature of the 
preform which is elevated by the inter
nal heat of the preform 
reaches 120 deg. C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
injection stretch blow molding of polyethylene into a hollow
molded product, such as a thin-wall container.In an injection stretch blow molding method
comprising injecting molten resin into an injection mold to
mold a preform, and stretch blow molding the perform into a
hollow molded product such as container in a blow mold, it is
known possible to mold almost all thermoplastic resins into
hollow thin-wall products. At the present, however, being
limited to polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene,
polycarbonate, vinyl chloride, etc., blow molding method is
applied to polyethylene which is highly demanded as hollow
molded products.Known methods for molding continuously from
injection molding of preform to stretch blow molding of
hollow molded products include a method comprising releasing
an injection molded preform from an injection mold while the
preform is still hot before being completely cooled and
solidified, conditioning the temperature of the hot preform, 
and stretch blow molding the conditioned preform into a
hollow molded product in a blow mold, and a method of
immediately stretch blow molding by omitting the temperature
conditioning of the preform as disclosed in the Japanese
Laid-open Patent Publication No. 4-214322.In both injection stretch blow molding methods, a
preform is molded by using an injection mold composed of a
cavity die for molding the outside wall of the preform and a
core die for molding the inside wall of the preform, and a
lip mold for molding the mouth portion of the preform, and
filling a cavity space between the cavity die and the core
die inserted into the cavity die by penetrating through the
opening of the cavity die and the closed lip mold, with
molten resin by injecting the molten resin from the bottom of
the cavity die.To release the injection molded preform from the
injection mold, both the core die and lip mold are moved
upwardly, or the core die is moved upwardly and the cavity
die is moved downwardly, and the preform after being released
is transferred into the blow mold while the mouth portion of
the preform is held by the lip mold.The reason why the preform is released by being
drawn out also from the core die is that it is extremely
difficult to stretch the preform in the axial direction by
the stretching rod in the state of tightly holding the core 
die by shrinkage of the preform due to cooling, and therefore
the preform is drawn out from both the cavity die and the
core die by using the lip mold also as the

<CLAIMS>
A method of injection stretch blow molding, said method comprising
the steps of:


injection molding a predetermined preform by filling an injection mold
composed of a cavity die, a core die and a lip mold with molten

polyethylene,
forcedly entering a gas into the boundary between the core die and
the preform,
releasing the preform from the cavity die and the core die of the injection
mold while a mouth portion of the preform is held by the lip mold,
transferring the preform into a blow die, and
stretch blow molding the preform into a hollow thin-wall product,

characterised in that
 the forcedly entering of the gas is carried out in order
to isolate the inside wall of the preform from the core die and to cool the

preform to a temperature suited to releasing,
the releasing of the preform is carried out while the inside of the preform
is not completely cooled and is still at high temperature, and the surface

temperature of the preform right after releasing is 80° to 90° C, and
the stretch blow molding of the preform is carried out within the time
interval before the surface temperature of the preform which is elevated by

the internal heat of the preform reaches 120° C.
A method for injection stretch blow molding of
polyethylene according to claim 1, further characterized in

that the entering gas is started right after completion of
injection filling of molten polyethylene.
