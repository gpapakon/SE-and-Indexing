<ABSTRACT>
Silage extractor and conveyor arm (10) including an 
elongated box-like structure (11, 12) which contains means 

(13, 14) for conveying the material extracted from the silo. 
A first end of the structure is provided with a mill (15) 

for cutting and removing loose or ensiled material, and a 
second end of the structure is articulated, about a 

horizontal axis (21), to a vertically extending support (23) 
which is mounted on a supporting frame (27). The arm is 

characterized in that the support (23) to which it is 
articulated is rotatably coupled to the supporting frame 

(27) about a vertical axis (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotating silage 
extractor and conveyor arm. Arms used particularly but not exclusively in the 
zootechnical field to load machines for shredding, mixing 
and distributing fodder, forage, fibrous products etc., are 
known; one type of arm includes a box-like structure in 
which the material, cut and/or removed by a mill located at 
one end, is conveyed and transferred for loading by a 
conveyor belt contained in the arm. The end of the box-like structure that lies opposite to 
the mill is articulated about a horizontal axis to a support 
which can be constituted directly by the mixing container, 
by a vertical upright fixed to the frame of the mixing 
container, or by an upright fixed to an independent self-propelled 
vehicle. As mentioned, the arm is articulated about a horizontal 
axis to allow the mill to move vertically downwards and 
erode the front of the silage. In order to perform multiple milling actions on the 
silage it is necessary to move the silage extractor arm with 
a series of maneuvers that must be executed by moving the 
vehicle supporting it. This naturally entails a waste of time. A principal aim of the present invention is to provide 
a silage extractor and conveyor arm which is capable of 
performing multiple milling actions, and thus loading 
operations, for each position in which it is placed with 
respect to the front of the loose product or of the product  
 
to be extracted from the silo. A consequent primary object is to speed up the loading 
of shredder-mixer trucks for fibrous products for zootechny. Another object is to provide a silage extractor and 
conveyor arm which has a simple structure and is easy to 
manufacture. Another object is to provide a silage extractor and 
conveyor arm that can be manufactured with commonly 
commercially available elements and materials. With this aim, these objects and others in view, there 
is provided, according to the present invention, a silage 
extractor and conveyor arm of the type comprising an 
elongated box-like structure which contains means for 
conveying the material extracted from the silo, a first end 
of said structure being provided with a mill for cutting 
and/or removing the loose or ensiled material, a second end 
of said structure being articulated, about a horizontal 
axis, to a vertically extending support which is mounted on 
a supporting frame, characterized in that said support is 
rotatably coupled to said supporting frame about a vertical 
axis. Further characteristics and
