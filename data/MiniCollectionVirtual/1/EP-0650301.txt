<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a three-dimensional
picture image display apparatus for picking up two-dimensional
picture images of a three-dimensional object
and for displaying a three-dimensional picture image of the
object.A conventional three-dimensional picture image
display apparatus for reproducing a stereoscopic picture
image uses spectacles which has two different colored
filters or two polarisation screens provided in a manner to fall
their polarization directions at right angle (JP-A-63-46093). In this
conventional display apparatus, different two picture images
are perceived by right and left eyes of an observer by using
the difference between the optical characteristics of right
and left eyepieces of the spectacles. The observer finds
the three-dimensionality of the images by a physiological
function of human brain called binocular parallax. However,
it is troublesome that the observer needs the spectacles.Recently, other three-dimensional picture image
display apparatuses without using the spectacles have been
proposed. In a display apparatus using a lenticular lens
sheet, the observer perceives two different picture images
by right and left eyes, since the focuses of binocular are 
different responding to the span of the binocular in
horizontal direction (JP-A-3-194588).
Picture images of a three-dimensional
object are taken by a plurality of image pickup devices
from multiple directions at the same time. Data of the
picture images are memorized in a memory and the picture
images are newly composed into a picture image for three-dimensionally
displaying. However, more than two image
pickup devices are used, so that a large memory area is
necessary for memorizing the image data from each image
pickup device. Furthermore, an exclusive image signal
processing circuit is necessary to compose the three-dimensional
picture image from a plurality of the picture
images taken by the image pickup devices. Thus, it is a
problem that the system of the three-dimensional picture
image display apparatus with the lenticular lens will be
complex.Furthermore, it is not necessary to use the
spectacles to observe the three-dimensional picture image in
the three-dimensional picture image display apparatus with
the lenticular lens. However, an angle of visibility by
which the stereoscopic picture image can be observed is
restricted by a pitch of the lenticular lens. The angle of
visibility can theoretically be expanded by reducing the
pitch of the lenticular lens. Actually, positioning of the 
lenticular lens sheet
