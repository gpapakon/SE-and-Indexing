<ABSTRACT>
In a process to vitrify esp. biological samples, the sample (10) is inserted in a sample chamber (11) which incorporates a fluid outlet. The sample chamber is filled with a fluid without cooling the sample to the freezing point, prior to vitrification. The chamber (11) is then charged with a cryogenic fluid at high pressure. The fluid outlet (35) is kept closed by a valve (41) until a predetermined pressure is reached in the sample chamber (11). The first fluid introduced into the sample chamber (11) is at a temp. above the freezing point of the sample. Also claimed is an appts. for carrying out the above process.

A method for vitrification of samples, in particular
biological samples, comprising the steps of introducing

the sample (10) into a sample chamber (11) having a fluid
outlet; filling the sample chamber with a fluid without

cooling the sample to freezing temperature; and further
introducing into the chamber a highly pressurised

cryogenic fluid for vitrification of the sample,
characterised in that the fluid outlet (35) is kept closed

by a closing element (41) until the pressure in the sample
chamber (11) has reached a predetermined value.
The method of claim 1, characterised in that the first
mentioned fluid, which is filled into the sample chamber

(11) first, has a temperature above the freezing point of
the sample.
The method of claim 2, characterised in that an alcohol,
e.g. isopropanol, is used as the first mentioned fluid.
The method of claim 1, characterised in that the first
mentioned fluid has a temperature which may be below the

freezing point of the sample, and in that the step of
introducing into the sample chamber the cryogenic fluid is

carried out immediately after the step of filling, so 
that, before the pressure has reached said predetermined

value, the sample will not be cooled below the freezing
point of the sample.
The method of claim 4, characterised in that the step of
filling the sample chamber (11) with the first mentioned

fluid is carried out until the pressure has reached said
predetermined value or a different predetermined value.
The method of claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the
temperature of the first mentioned fluid is selected such

that, as pressure rises in the sample chamber, the sample
will practically not be heated.
The method of anyone of the claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that a cryogenic fluid is heated or cooled, to serve as

the first mentioned fluid for filling sample chamber.
The method of anyone of the claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that liquid nitrogen at a pressure of 2'100 bar is used

as the cryogenic fluid.
An apparatus for carrying out the method according to
anyone of the claims 1 to 8, comprising a sample chamber

(11) with a fluid outlet (35), holder means (12,33) to
hold the sample, supply means (25,36) to supply said high

pressurised cryogenic fluid, characterised by a closing
element (41) on the outlet (35) to hinder the fluid from

leaving the sample chamber (11) until the pressure in the
sample chamber (11) has reached a predetermined value.
The apparatus of claim 9, characterised by a valve (55) or
valves (34,55) to supply the cryogenic fluid to the sample

chamber (11) and, eventually, to stop supply of the first
mentioned fluid. 
The apparatus of claim 9 or 10, characterised in that the
valve (55) for controlling the supply of cryogenic fluid

to the sample chamber opens when a predetermined value of
the pressure, e.g. 2'100 bar, is reached.
The apparatus of claim 10 or 11, characterised in that the
closing element (41) and the valve (55) are interlocked by

a interlocking device (63), e.g. a lever.
The apparatus of anyone of claims 10 to 12, characterised
in that the supply means for the first mentioned fluid is

formed by a bypass (57,70), within which the cryogenic
fluid becomes the first mentioned fluid.
The apparatus of claim 13, characterised in that the
bypass (57) leads from the valve (55) to the sample

chamber (11).
The apparatus of claim 13, characterised in that the
bypass (70) forms a branch of the high pressure tube (25)

leading to the valve (55).
The apparatus of anyone of the claims 13 to 15,
characterised by a heating/cooling device (59) within the

bypass (57,70) for the first mentioned fluid.
The apparatus of anyone of the claims 13 to 16,
characterised by a valve (60) within the bypass (57,70),

opening at a predetermined pressure.
The apparatus of anyone of the claims 9 to 17,
characterised in that the closing element (41) is a

spring-loaded valve with a spring (47), the spring tension
of which is controllable, e.g. by a screw (49). 
The apparatus of anyone of the claims 9 to 18,
characterised in that an exchangeable nozzle (37) is

placed on the outlet (35).
The apparatus of anyone of the claims 10 to 16,
characterised by a control unit (32) controlling the

supply of the fluid or the fluids and the reduction of the
pressure within the apparatus.
The apparatus of claim 20, characterised by a control
element (73) coupled to said control unit (32) influencing

the interlocking device (63) after the vitrification until
the reduction of pressure through the outlet (35) has come

to its end.
The apparatus of claim 20 or 21, characterised by a valve
(38) coupled to the control unit (32) to allow the

reduction of pressure within the bypass (70).
The apparatus of anyone of the claims 20 to 22,
characterised by a sensing means (71) signalling to the

control unit the opening of the valve (55) stopping the
first fluid.
