<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a dispenser pouch
adapted to contain a high viscosity liquid therein and more
particularly to a sealed pouch having a pump adapted to
dispense a pre-measured charge of liquid therefrom when an
external pumping pressure is applied to the pouch.Conventional dispensers for liquids having relatively
high viscosities, such as heavy duty soaps, shampoos, tomato
ketchup, mayonnaise, tooth paste, high viscosity oils or the
like, oftentimes take the form of a semirigid plastic
container having an openable closure cap or a reciprocal
dispensing valve mounted thereon. Conventional dispensers of
this type are relatively expensive to manufacture, are prone
to malfunction and leakage and normally do not insure that a
pre-measured charge of the liquid will be efficiently
dispensed therefrom.Other types of conventional dispensers include thin-walled
plastic pouches that are heat sealed to retain a
liquid product therein. A corner of the pouch is either
ripped open to dispense the product or a closure plug is used
for this purpose. Further, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,009,498;
3,184,121; 3,815,794 and 4,252,257 and Canadian Patent No.
735,289 disclose pouches or bags which provide various types
of closures to seal the bags after product has been dispensed
therefrom. Bags of this type are incapable of efficiently
dispensing relatively high viscosity liquids (e.g. 3,000 to 
14,000 centipoises) and require mechanical manipulation or other
extraneous forces to open and close the valves thereof.The dispenser pouches disclosed in applicant's U.S. Patent Nos.
5,000,350 and 5,067,635 have solved the above prior art problems by
providing systems that function efficiently to dispense liquids having
a wide variety of viscosities. However, when liquids having relatively
high viscosities (e.g., in excess of 3,000 centipoises) were used in
the so called deep-drawn pouch of the type shown in Figs. 4 and 5 of
U.S. Patent No. 5,000,350, the dispensing efficiency of the pouch was
found to lessen when the contents of the pouch approached empty.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a pump
system in combination with a dispenser pouch comprising a pair of
overlying panels defining a reservoir adapted to contain a liquid
therein and a spout on a lower end of said pouch, said pump system
comprising pump means including a separate button-like insert having a
bulbous portion for dispensing said liquid from said pouch in response
to the application of pumping pressure thereto, charging chamber
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pump system in combination with a dispenser pouch (10)
comprising a pair of overlying panels (11, 12) defining a reservoir

(13) adapted to contain a liquid therein and a spout (23) on a lower
end of said pouch (10), said pump system comprising pump means (16)

including a separate button-like insert (18) having a bulbous portion
for dispensing said liquid from said pouch (10) in response to the

application of pumping pressure thereto, charging chamber means (20),
defined within said insert (18), for retaining a pre-measured charge of

said liquid therein, inlet passage means (26) for communicating liquid
from said reservoir (13) to automatically recharge said charging

chamber means (20) with said pre-measured charge of liquid in response
to release of pumping pressure from said pump means (16), outlet means

(25) for dispensing said pre-measured charge of liquid from said
charging chamber means (20) in response to said application of pumping

pressure to said pump means (16), and normally closed valve means (24),
for opening automatically in response to said application of said

pumping pressure to said pump means (16) characterised in that the
insert (18) is entirely disposed in said spout (23) and is sandwiched

between said panels (11,12) in a like-shaped recess defined in one of
said panels (11) of the spout (23), and the normally closed valve means

(24) is defined by and between said panels (11, 12) at said outlet
means (25).
The combination of claim 1 characterised in that said panels
(11, 12) are sealed together about peripheral portions (19) thereof.
The combination of claim 2 characterised in that peripheral
portions (19) of said insert (18) are heat sealed to at least one of

said panels (11, 12).
The combination as claimed in any of the preceding claims
characterised in that said bulbous portion is centrally disposed on

said insert (18).
The combination of claim 4 characterised in that said bulbous
portion is at least generally semispherical. 
The combination as claimed in any of the preceding claims
characterised in that said inlet passage means (26) has a

cross-sectional area substantially larger than a cross-sectional area
of said outlet means (25).
The combination as claimed in any of the preceding claims
characterised in that only one of said panels (11) is expanded on only

one side of said pouch (10) to define said reservoir (13) and the other
one of said panels (12) is at least substantially flat.
The combination as claimed in any of the preceding claims
characterised in that it further comprises a dispensing unit (29)

including a mounting bracket (30) having said dispenser pouch (10)
mounted thereon, a cover (32a) mounted on said mounting bracket (30) to

at least substantially cover said dispenser pouch (10), and compression
means (37) for engaging and applying said pumping pressure to said pump

means (16) to selectively dispense said pre-measured charge of liquid
from said charging chamber means (20).
The combination of claim 8 characterised in that said compression
means (37) comprises a pivotally mounted press plate (32c) forming a

bottom portion of said cover (32a) covering said charging chamber (20)
