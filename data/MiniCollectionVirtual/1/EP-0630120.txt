<ABSTRACT>
The synchronisation method consists in selecting, within a mobile station, at least one pseudo-random periodic sequence (PN) which corresponds and is synchronised with the reference sequence transmitted by a base station on a pilot channel, and received by the mobile station following a propagation path whatever the frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver. Various possible sequences are tested, by calculating the quantities E[s(t).s

A method of synchronization, for code division
multiple access (CDMA) radiotelephone communications in

which a base station establishes a pilot channel (CP) in
addition to a plurality of CDMA transmission channels (C1,

C2, ....Cn) each defined by a respective spreading sequence
(PN1, PN2,..., PNn) modulating data bits to be transmitted

(M1, M2,..., Mn), a periodic pseudorandom reference
sequence (PN) synchronized with the spreading sequences and

having a chip rate greater than the bit rate of the data
bits to be transmitted being transmitted over the pilot

channel (CP), the base band signals transmitted over said
channels being combined and then modulated on a carrier

frequency to form a radio signal transmitted by the base
station to mobile stations, the synchronization method

consisting in selecting, at a mobile station, at least one
periodic pseudorandom sequence which corresponds to and is

synchronized with the reference sequence (PN) transmitted
over the pilot channel (CP) of a base station and received

by the mobile station over a propagation path, and being
characterized in that, at the mobile station, various

possible sequences are tested by calculating the quantities
E[s(t).s*(t-τ)]
 and E[s(t).s*(t)], in which E [.]
 designates
the mean value calculated over a predetermined integration

time (T), τ designates a predetermined delay, and
s(t) = r(t).c(t) designates the product of the

received base band signal (r(t)) by the value (c(t))
of the sequence under test, and by calculating the

ratio |E[s(t).s*(t-τ)]| / E[s(t).s*(t)]

sequence under test is selected if said ratio exceeds a

predetermined threshold.

that said predetermined integration time (T) is of the same

order as the period of the reference sequence.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in
that said predetermined integration time is less than the

period of the reference sequence, and in that after a
sequence under test has been selected, synchronization is

verified by performing calculations and comparisons that are
identical except in that a longer integration time is used,

of the same order as the period of the reference sequence.

time, shorter than the first integration time and than the
period of the refenrece sequence (PN), the product of the

received base band signal by the value (c(t)) of the

same order as the inverse of the chip rate of the reference

characterized in that the carrier frequency (FP), used for

obtaining the base band signal (r(t)) by demodulating the
radio signal received by the mobile station, is modified by

applying a correction thereto, which correction is
proportional to the argument of the complex quantity

E[s(t).s*(t-τ)] calculated while testing the sequences.
