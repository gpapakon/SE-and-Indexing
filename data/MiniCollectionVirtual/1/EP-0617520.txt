<ABSTRACT>
In a portable radio communication apparatus, a matching 
circuit is electrically connected to an antenna when the 

antenna is retracted into a casing. In this condition, the 
antenna and a feed circuit are matched as desirably as when 

the antenna is extended from the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a
cordless telephone, transceiver or similar portable radio
communication apparatus.Particularly, the present invention relates to a portable radio communication
apparatus according to the preamble part of claim 1 and to a rod antenna according
to the preamble part of claim 4. Such a portable radio communication apparatus
and such a rod antenna are known from US-A-4 890 114.Today, a portable radio communication apparatus of the
kind described is often put in the user's bag or even in a
pocket by virtue of remarkable miniaturization. Usually, this
kind of apparatus has a casing and an antenna retractably
mounted on the casing. The antenna is retracted into the
casing when the apparatus is simply carried by the user or
extend from the casing when the apparatus is to be used.
Hence, when the apparatus is waiting for an incoming call, the
antenna is, in many cases, received in the casing. This brings
about a problem that the antenna in the retracted position
cannot attain a sufficient characteristic, reducing the
transmission/reception range to a critical degree. What is
important is, therefore, to enhance the antenna characteristic
when the antenna is held in the retracted position.On the other hand, it has been customary with the
apparatus of the kind described to match the antenna and a 
feed circuit by a matching section, which is included in the
feed circuit, such that an optimal condition is set up when the
antenna is extended from the casing. It follows that in the
retracted position, the antenna and the feed circuit cannot be
matched, noticeably degrading the antenna characteristic. As
a result, the apparatus is prevented from performing
communication stably.In GB-A-2 235 588 a telescopic antenna is disclosed. The lower
end of the telescopic antenna in the collapsed position is in contact
with a matching circuit.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a portable radio communication apparatus capable of
matching, when an antenna is retracted into a casing, an
antenna and a feed circuit as desirably as when the antenna is
extended from the casing, thereby enhancing the antenna
characteristic.This object is achieved by a portable radio communication apparatus as
defined in claim 1 and a rod antenna as defined in claim 4. The above and other objects, features and advantages of
the present invention will become more apparent from the
following detailed description taken with the accompanying
drawings in which:
