<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in immersing the articles which have previously undergone a thermochemical diffusion of either nitriding or sulphonitriding or carbonitriding type, in a bath of molten salts made up of alkali metal carbonates, nitrates, hydroxides and their oxygenated salts, the relative anionic weight quantities of carbonates, nitrates and hydroxides, expressed for sodium salts and corresponding to the active, that is to say liquid, phase of the bath being the following:  11

 equivalent, is the following:  0.05

 oxygenated anions 
<
 0.5. This process makes it possible to guarantee a high degree of reproducibility of the results, whatever the type of articles treated.

Method for improving the resistance to corrosion and wear 
of ferrous metal parts where the
 parts, which have previously 
undergone a thermochemical diffusion of the nitriding, 

sulphonitriding or carbonitriding type, are immersed in a bath 
of molten salts composed of carbonates, nitrates, hydroxides 

and oxygenated alkali metal salts chosen from amongst 
bichromates, chromates, permanganates, peroxycarbonates, 

iodates and periodates, characterised in that the relative 
anionic quantities by weight of carbonates, nitrates and 

hydroxides, expressed in relation to sodium salts and 
corresponding to the active phase, that is to say the liquid 

in the bath, are as follows:

Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
temperature of the bath is between 350 and 550°C. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the temperature of the bath is between 450 and 550°C. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterised in that the period of immersion of the parts in 
the bath is greater than 10 minutes. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the thermochemical diffusion is carried 

out in such as way as to produce, on the surface of the part, 
a layer which has, in contact with the substrate, a compact 

part with a thickness of between 6 and 12 micrometres and on 
the outside a finely porous part with a thickness of between 3 

and 6 micrometres, the mean diameter of the bores being 
between 0.1 and 2 micrometres.
