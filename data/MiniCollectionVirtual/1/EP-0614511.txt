<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle driveline joints presently restrict shaft angularity, which results in lengthy driveshafts, whilst conventional flexible drives using links become too large in diameter when matching vehicle spring movements. The drive comprises hardened driving and driven flanges (1a, 1b), each with three, equally spaced, deep, radial grooves, facing one another, to entrap a concentric unit, consisting of three driving arms (3, 4, 5), journalled together at their centre, but each separately, rotatably mounted. Each arm has a roller (2) at its extremity running in a respective groove and is cranked such that one roller (2) engages driving flange (1a) whilst the other roller (2) engages identical driven flange (1b) but 180 degrees out of phase. Possible alternatives to rollers are balls, shoes, slippers or other suitable member. The arrangement permits drive to be transmitted between the flanges whilst the rotational axes are laterally displaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A FLEXIBLE DRIVEThe present invention relates to flexible drives. The drives may be used in road, off road, or rail vehicles or in industry.Restrictions on the angularity of Hooke joints and those of constant velocity with freedom for axial translation, cause driveshafts to be long in relation to the vertical movement of vehicles between their suspension bump and bounce stops, in addition to the continuous lesser movements made in traffic. Driveshaft length conflicts with competitive pressure to make improved use of the space occupied by the power unit, in order to maximise that available for passengers and goods. Flexible drives are not new and those which might have been expected to economise on the length occupied by driveshafts in recent automotive practice are not used, because when of suitable size and diameter for a road vehicle, they fall very short of the range of movement of a vehicle suspension. This largely results from their use of links to transmit torque between dancing rings and their driving and driven members, to reduce the friction, whilst simulating kinematically, the pairs of sliding surfaces, mutually at 90 degrees, of the intermediate member of the classic constant velocity Oldham coupling, acknowledged as the basis of the vast majority of such 

 -2- couplings, though very many do not provide for constant velocity. Moreover, when this type of coupling is displaced from its central position, the intermediate member, or "dancing" ring, performs an orbital motion, twice per revolution, circular- or near circular, on a diameter equal to the displacement. This orbital motion results in an eccentric force derived from the centrifugal force of the "dancing" ring and partial weight of the drive links. Because of the limited primary suspension range of rail vehicles and their great weight, this eccentric force is usually acceptable, but becomes unacceptable given the spring range, suspension movement in traffic and relatively light weight of road vehicles. A more recent type to appear in rail traction, providing constant velocity, utilises three concentric driving arms journalled together and connected by links to simulate a heavy floating member, whilst driving, driven and floating members lie in one plane. When the suspension is displaced, the assembly of driving arms, journalled together as a floating member do not have any orbital motion and continue to run stably, but at a deflection of one half that of the suspension, with the driving arms continuously making rotational adjustments

A flexible drive comprising a driving flange (la) , a driven flange (lb) facing the driving flange, characterised by guides (11,12,13) disposed in each flange and extending radially with respect to the centre of the flange, members (2) retained for movement in the guides and means for operatively connecting the members (2) in the two flanges together whereby torque may be transmi ted through the members (2) between the flanges and the rotational axis of the flanges moved laterally relative to one another.
2. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 1, in which the members (2) comprises balls.
3. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 1, in which the members (2) comprise slippers or shoes.
4. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 1, in which the members (2) comprises rollers.
5. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 3 or 4, in which the members (2) engage with and are contained by the guide.
6. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 4, or claim 5 


 when appendant to claim 4, in which the rollers are journalled on anti-friction bearings.
7. A flexible drive as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the means for operatively connecting the members (2) together comprise three driving arms (3,4,5) .
8. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 7, in which the three driving arms (3,4,5) are equidistantly spaced.
9. A flexible drive as claimed in claim 7 or 8, in which the arms are concentrically journalled together at their centres on anti-friction bearings (3a,3b) .
