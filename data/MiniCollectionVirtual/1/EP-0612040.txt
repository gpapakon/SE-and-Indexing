<ABSTRACT>
Techniques for multiple verification of credit 
cards incorporating digital image information and 

authorization data onto a credit card to assist in the card 
verification process. This technique requires the authorized 

card holder to have a picture identification accompany the 
application for the card. Picture information is converted 

to a digital image that is stored and used in one or a 
plurality of means for verifying that the presenter of the 

card, at the point of the transaction, is the authorized 
user. Such means include visual comparison of card presenter 

and extracted digital image information and verification that 
the data has not been altered. Encryption of the data, as it 

is read from the card, at the point of origin is used to 
formulate encoded authorization data that is then compared 

against like encoded authorized card holder data stored at a 
centrally located data base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
credit cards and to the verification of the owner of the
credit card. More particularly, the invention is directed
to a method and associated apparatus for reading a credit
card with a digital picture of the owner or authorized user
and multiply validating the authenticity of the card.Visual verification of identity plays a role in
many types of transactions and security procedures. For
example, signatures, fingerprints or images of faces are
compared in to establish identity. The creation of a
fraudulent identities or the misrepresentation of identity
results can allow individuals to commit fraud and breach
security systems.One system which relies on verification of
identity for transactions is the credit and charge card
system. These cards are an increasingly popular means for
consumers and validation requestors to complete
transactions. However, part of the cost incurred from this
convenience is the burgeoning growth of card fraud. In 1991
the estimated cost to the financial industry for credit card
fraud was $1.58 billion. The cost of this fraud is paid for
by the banking/credit industry, but it is passed to the
consumer in the form of higher card interest rates and fees
and to the validation requestors in the form of additional
transaction commission fees.Methods used to combat this fraud have been the
use of holographic images on cards, the need for validation
requestors to obtain transaction approval, the encoding of
cardholder information on magnetic strips on the back of the
card, and signature verification. A well-known approach is
to have image information available for visual verification 
that the card bearer is the authorized owner (see Luther G.
Simjian, "Verification System using Coded Identifying and
Storage Means," U.S. Patent No. 3,569,619, issued March 9,
1971) and is an important component in the present
invention. A further refinement on this system is to
scramble the image information (see Robert L. Nathans,
"Counterfeit Proof ID Card having a Scrambled Facial Image,"
U.S. Patent No. 4,972,476, issued May 11, 1989). Again, the
de-scrambling and reconstruction of the facial image is
validated at a single location. This could be defeated by a
counterfeiter who has access to the scrambling algorithm. A
similar notion is to have a decryption key carried along
with the credit card, either by a PIN number or other device
encoded on the magnetic stripe (see Frank T. Leighton and
Silvio Micali, "Method and System for Personal
Identification,"

<CLAIMS>
A credit card validation system comprising:

a) a credit card (10) having digital image data recorded thereon representing the
image of at least one authorized user and authorizing data;
b) at a first location:

1) reader means (10) for reading the digital image data recorded on said credit card:
2) means (70) for displaying the digital image representing the authorized user:
3) algorithm means (40) for providing at least an encryption algorithm for encoding
selected portions of the digital image data;
4) a first processor means (50) for encoding said selected portions of the digital image
data read from said credit card with the provided encryption algorithm;
5) means to communicate digital data at a second remote location;
c) at said second remote location:

1) second processor means (90) for receiving data from said first processor; and
2) storage means (80) having stored therein digital data corresponding to the
authorizing data recorded on said credit card and encoded with the provided encryption

algorithm, said second processor means comparing the received data from said first
processor with the digital data from said storage means to provide a validation signal

when a correspondence is detected;

   and characterized by

d) means to transfer from the first processor to the second processor the digital image
data recorded on the credit card and representing the image of the user so that said data

could be stored at the remote location when a lack of correspondance between the data
received from the first processor and the digital data from said storage means is detected.
The credit card validation system according to claim 1 wherein said algorithm means
provides a plurality of encryption algorithms for selective encoding portions of the digital

data.
The credit card validation system according to claim 2 wherein the selection of an
encryption algorithm is pseudo random.
The credit card verification system according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said second
processor selects the encryption algorithm for said first processor means.
The credit card verification system according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein digital
image data recorded on said credit card is in compressed form.
The credit card verification system according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said
storage means is a photographic compact disk system. 
A credit card validation system wherein the first location is a point-of-sale, the second
location is a remote card administrative agency and the image of the authorized user is a

photograph of the face of an authorized user.
A method for validating a credit card comprising the steps of:

a) storing digital image data corresponding to an image of an authorized credit card
user on a credit card along with authorizing user data obtained by encoding selected

portions of the digital image data with an encryption algorithm;
b) establishing, in a card administration agency, a central data base for a multiplicity
of card user wherein encoded authorized user data is stored;

   at a point-of-sale:

c) reading the digital data recorded on said credit card;
d) displaying the image represented by the digital image data;
e) visually determining if a match exists between the displayed image and the credit
card user;
f) encoding the selected portions of the digital image data with the encryption
algorithm;
g) transmitting the coded data obtained in step f) to the card administration agency;

   at the card administration agency

h) comparing the received data with stored authorized user data to determine if a
match exists; and


i1) either upon the existence of a match sending to the point of sale a validation signal;
i2) or upon the existence of a lack of match, sending to the point of sale, an order
signal so that the stored digital image data matching the image of the credit card user is

transmitted to the card administration agency.
