<ABSTRACT>
What is described is, in the first place, a device for changing foil rolls, especially for pallet winders, with a foil-unrolling device (12) which has a spindle (16) for mounting the foil roll (17) having a tube core (18) and onto which the foil roll (17, 38) can be attached and from which the empty tube core (18) can be removed. It is distinguished by a foil-roll transporter (14) which can be positioned relative to the foil-unrolling device and which is intended for transporting the foil rolls (38) between a collecting/supply station (15) and the foil-unrolling device (12), which foil-roll transporter has a tube-core receiver (30) for the first (spent) foil roll (17) and a foil-roll holder (31) for the second (new) foil roll (38) and a spindle retraction device (28), and, in the second place, a method for operating such a device as well as, in the third place, a foil-holding clamp (32) for this purpose.
