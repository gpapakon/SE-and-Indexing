<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of crystalline loracarbef monohydrate. The β-lactam antibiotic of the formula (I) 
 
is the potent orally active antibiotic known as loracarbef. The 
antibiotic is described, for example, by Hashimoto et al. in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,335,211, issued June 15, 1982. The above compound is known in various forms, 
including the crystalline monohydrate form, which is disclosed 
in European Patent Publication 0,311,366 having a publication 
date of April 12, 1989. Other known solvate forms of the 
compound are disclosed in Eckrich et al. U.S. Patent No. 
4,977,257. The crystalline dihydrate form of loracarbef is 
disclosed in European Patent Publication 0,369,686 having a 
publication date of May 23, 1990. As indicated in the EPO 
application, the crystalline monohydrate may be prepared by 
first suspending the dihydrate in water and effecting solution 
by the addition of acid followed by the adjustment of the pH 
with base, or by the addition of base followed by acid.  
 It has been determined that loracarbef crystalline 
monohydrate is a fine "hair-like" crystal which results in very 
slow filtration. In filtering the monohydrate, the crystals 
tend to form a mat on the filter medium which prevents or 
reduces the ability to de-water the filter cake, which increases 
the wash volume required. As loracarbef monohydrate is 
moderately soluble in water, (approximately 10 mg/ml), loss of 
yield results when such washes are increased. Total filtration 
time is of course increased as wash volume increases. What is needed in light of the above difficulties is a 
process for preparing crystalline loracarbef monohydrate in a 
more efficient manner, that is, to avoid the requirement of 
filtering the crystalline monohydrate. The invention provides a process for the preparation 
of the crystalline monohydrate form of the compound of formula 
(I) 
 
which exposes the crystalline dihydrate form of a 
compound of formula (I) to a temperature between 50° to 
65°C and a relative humidity of between 60 to 
100%. Loracarbef dihydrate exists in a plate-like habit and 
consequently filters much more quickly than the crystalline  
 
monohydrate form of loracarbef. Experimentation has shown that 
this filtration may be 20 times as fast as the filtration of the 
monohydrate. Attempts have been made to convert dihydrate to 
monohydrate as a wet cake or dry solid using high temperatures 
alone. However, that procedure proved unsuccessful. It was discovered that using a high
