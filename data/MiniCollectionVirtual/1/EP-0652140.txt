<ABSTRACT>
An automobile safety air belt (10) is provided with air passages (11,12) in 
its sections corresponding to the abdomen, the side, the breast and the 

shoulder of a passenger (100), and with an air bag (13) in its section 
intending to be fastened diagonally about the upper part of the passenger 

body from the side to the shoulder through the breast. The air passages 
(11,12) and air bag (13) are folded and protected by a protection cover (14) 

having a breakable section. In case of a traffic accident, the safety air 
belt (10) is inflated with pressurized air in its air passages (11,12) as 

well as in its air bag (13) by an operating device (17) thus breaking the 
breakable section of the protective cover (14) and causing the expanded air 

bag (13) to be precisely and rapidly interposed between the passenger (100) 
and the car body irrespective of collision velocity of the automobile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an automobile 
safety belt for protection of a passenger from collision with 
hard materials of the automobile in traffic accident, and more 
particularly to a structural improvement of such an automobile 
safety belt. As well known to those skilled in the art, automobiles 
are generally provided with safety equipments, such as air 
bags and safety belts, for protection of a passenger from 
collision with hard materials, particularly provided in a 
cabin of the automobile, in traffic accident including 
automobile collision. The air bags for protection of the passenger from 
collision using air cushion effect are conventionally 
classified into electronic type air bags and mechanical type 
air bags. The known air bag, irrespective of its type, 
generally includes an operating device which senses abrupt 
change of inertia force, caused by mechanical shock applied to 
the car body in a traffic accident such as collision of the  
 
automobile, in a short time and makes pressurized air be 
charged in the air bag. These prior art air bags are 
disclosed; for example; in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open 
Publication Nos. Sho. 63-28004, Sho. 63-50203. Heisei. 2-2683 
and Heisei. 2-20127. The air bag is generally equipped at an upper section, a 
side section or a lower section of the automobile cabin and 
rapidly charged with the pressurized air in the case of 
collision of the automobile in order to be expanded and to be 
interposed between the car body and the passenger. For 
example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No. Sho. 
61-11084 discloses an air bag which is installed in a steering 
wheel of the automobile and interposed between the steering 
wheel and the driver while being expanded in the case of 
collision of automobile, thus to protect the driver from 
collision with hard materials including the steering wheel. It is noted that when the collision velocity of the 
automobile is lower than a predetermined level and the 
passenger fastens the safety belt; the above air bags are 
sufficiently expanded and precisely interposed between the 
passenger and the car body before collision of the passenger 
with the car body; thus to achieve the desired protection of 
the passenger from collision with the car body. However, the 
above air bags may not achieve the desired protection of the 
passenger from collision when the passenger does not fasten  
 
the safety belt. Particularly, when the collision velocity of 
the automobile is higher than the

<CLAIMS>
An automobile safety air belt connected at an end 
thereof to a take-up member of a car body and at the other end 

thereof to a fixing member of said car body, further 
comprising: 

   an air bag packed in a middle section of said belt such 
that it is exposed to the outside of said belt when it is 

charged with pressurized air and expanded; 
   first and second air passages provided in said belt on 

opposed sides of said air bag and communicating with each 
other through said air bag; 

   a protection cover covering said air bag as well as said 
air passages, said protection cover having a breakable section 

for receiving said air bag and allowing said air bag to be 
exposed to the outside of said cover through said breakable 

section when said air bag is charged with the pressurized air; 
   a lock hanger movably inserted on said protection cover 

and detachably locked to a locking member of said car body, 
said lock hanger having an opening for receiving said 

protection cover; 
   a nipple mounted on said protection cover such that it 

communicates with one of said air passages, said nipple being 
connected to operating means through a high pressure hose in 

order to supply the pressurized air from said operating means 
 

to said air passages as well as to said air bag. 
The automobile safety air belt according to claim 1, 
wherein when said belt is fastened about a passenger body, a 

section of said protection cover having said first air passage 
surrounds the abdomen of said passenger, said breakable 

section having said air bag diagonally surrounds the upper 
body of said passenger from the side to the shoulder, and the 

other section of said protection cover having said second air 
passage is positioned between the shoulder of said passenger 

to a hanger fixed to said car body. 
The automobile safety air belt according to claim 1 or 
2, wherein a protection member is placed between said 

protection cover and each of said air passages and said air 
bag is bonded to an inner surface of said protection cover at 

its rear surface. 
The automobile safety air belt according to claim 1, 
further comprising a pair of sewed sections connected to 

opposed ends of said protection cover, one of said sewed 
sections being connected to said take-up member but the other 

of said sewed sections being connected to said fixing member. 
The automobile safety air belt according to claim 1, 
wherein said lock hanger is provided at an upper periphery of 

said opening with a plurality of rounded protrusions spaced 
out at regular intervals to form recesses therebetween. 
The automobile safety air belt according to claim 5, 
further comprising a plurality of rounded protrusions provided 

on a lower periphery of said opening of the lock hanger. 
The automobile safety air belt according to claim 1, 
wherein said operating means is fixed to a side frame of said 

car body such that it is covered by an interior material of 
said car body and part of said high pressure hose connected to 

said means is exposed to the outside of said interior material 
to be connected to said nipple.
