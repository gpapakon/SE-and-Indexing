<ABSTRACT>
The switching device has a stationary part (10), which is arranged in a switch cabinet and contains power supply terminals and power distribution terminals (18, 19), a moving housing body and a disconnecting device. The moving housing body is used to accommodate a switch mechanism (27) and an additional device having an electrical auxiliary circuit which is supplied with power by means of wiring which is passed from the stationary part (10) to the moving housing body. The housing body (20) can be disconnected (disconnected position) in DC terms from the stationary part (10), or can be connected in DC terms to it (connected position) by means of the disconnecting device. The wiring has a plug connection which opens during movement from the connected position into the disconnected position and closes during movement from the disconnected position into the connected position. Those parts (105,107;106,108) of this wiring which interact with one another are inserted into mutually opposite side walls (11,A) of the stationary part (2) and of the housing body. The switching device can be accommodated in an extremely space-saving manner in the switch cabinet. During connection and disconnection, the additional connection is automatically connected to the switch cabinet power supply and, respectively, disconnected from it.

Switching apparatus, especially a low-voltage
power switch, having a stationary part (10) which is

arranged in a switch cabinet and includes power supply
terminals (18) and power distribution terminals (19),

having a moving housing body (20) for accommodating a
switch mechanism (27) and a first additional device

with an electrical auxiliary circuit which is supplied
with electrical power by wiring which is passed from

the stationary part (10) to the housing body (20), and
having a disconnecting device which, by displacement of

the housing body (20) in the switching apparatus,
produces a disconnection point (disconnected position)

or a DC connection between the stationary part (10) and
the housing body (20) (connected position), the wiring

having a first plug connection which opens during the
transition from the connected position to the

disconnected position and closes during the transition
from the disconnected position to the connected

position, the first plug connection having a first
connecting part (107, 108) which is connected to the

electrical power supply terminals (18), is preferably
constructed as a plug socket and is inserted into the

stationary part (2), as well as a second connecting
part (105, 106) which can be connected to the auxiliary

circuit in DC terms and includes a plug (C),
characterized in that the mutually interacting parts

(105, 107; 106, 108) thereof are inserted into mutually
opposite sidewalls (11, A) of the stationary part (2)

and of the housing body (3), in that the second
connecting part (105, 106) is inserted into the housing

body (3) and can be connected via a second plug
connection to a third connecting part (102) which is

inserted into a sidewall of a removable front cover
(28) of the housing body (3) and is electrically

conductively connected to the auxiliary circuit. 
Switching apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterized in that one seat (40, 43), which is used

for accommodation of the associated connecting part
(102, 105, 107) and is constructed in the form of a

groove, is formed in the sidewall of the stationary
part (2), of the housing body (3) and/or of the front

cover (28) of the housing body in each case.
Switching apparatus according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the seat (40, 43) is constructed

in an undercut manner and preferably has a dovetail
profile.
Switching apparatus according to one of Claims
2 or 3, characterized in that holding parts which are

constructed as undercuts (42) are formed in the seat
(40, 43) and holding parts which are constructed as

flexible tabs (109) are formed in the connecting part
(102, 105, 107), which holding parts engage with one

another when the connecting part (102, 105, 107) is
pushed in as far as the rear end of the groove (40,

43).
Switching apparatus according to one of Claims
1 to 4, characterized in that at least one longitudinal

slot (110) which eases the elastic deformation is
formed in at least one of the connecting parts (102,

105, 107).
Switching apparatus according to one of Claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the first additional

device can be connected via a third plug connection to
the auxiliary circuit of a second additional device

which can be inserted into a cover (45) of the front
cover (28).
Switching apparatus according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the second additional device is

constructed as an ammeter and has a display device (4)
which is fastened on the cover (45).
Switching apparatus according to Claim 7,
characterized in that, in addition to the display

device (4) the cover (45) carries auxiliary circuits 
which are constructed as a driver (9) and as a control

logic circuit (8).
