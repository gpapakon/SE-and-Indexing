<ABSTRACT>
A conduit (22) is provided with a nozzle (24) for injecting NO
x
 
inhibiting reagent into an appropriate temperature window in the flue 

gas of a package, utility, or industrial type boiler (10) to reduce 
emissions of NO
x
. A temperature sensor (26) is mounted adjacent the 
nozzle (24) to measure the flue gas temperature thereby locating the 

appropriate temperature window, and a controlled drive (28,30) moves 
the nozzle (24) to the temperature window.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
injecting NOx inhibiting reagent into the flue gas of a boiler, in order 
to reduce the emission of NOx. NOx emissions are a common problem encountered during the 
operation of boilers due to extremely high temperatures involved in 
boiler operations. Concern for the environment has resulted in the 
development of several methods and devices to combat the NOx pollutant 
problem. US Patent No. US-A-4 208 386 discloses a process for reducing NOx 
emissions found in combustion effluent, through the use of urea or a 
urea solution sprayed onto the flue gas having a temperature window of 
about 700°C (1300°F) to 1100°C (2000°F). It has been found that NOx 
control is best if the reagent is injected within this temperature 
window. US Patent No. US-A-4 842 834 discloses a process and apparatus 
for reducing the concentration of pollutants in flue gas due to 
combustion of the fuel. An effluent treatment fluid is injected at 
independently variable droplet sizes and distances into a wide variety 
of distribution patterns within the flue gas passage. An atomization 
conduit extends into the flue gas and is positioned coaxially around a 
treatment fluid conduit to supply an atomization fluid. US Patent No. US-A-4 985 218 discloses a process and apparatus 
for reducing NOx concentrations in a flue gas from a combustion chamber. 
The process and apparatus enable the injection of a flue gas treatment 
fluid at a low treatment fluid flow rate, yet provide an even 
dispersion of treatment fluid within the flue gas passage with little 
or no clogging. An atomization conduit, positioned coaxially within a 
treatment fluid supply conduit, extends into the flue gas and supplies 
an atomization fluid, such as steam or air. A treatment fluid is 
supplied through a supply conduit and through at least one jet in the 
atomization conduit wall at a velocity of between about 0.6 to 18 ms⁻¹ 
(2 to 60 feet per second), causing atomization of the treatment fluid 
within a nozzle. The treatment fluid used to reduce NOx emissions is  
 
preferably comprised of an aqueous solution of urea, ammonia, 
nitrogenated hydrocarbon, oxygenated hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon or 
combinations thereof. US Patent No. US-A-5 058 514 discloses a process for controlling 
acid gas emissions in flue gases. An in-furnace injection process is 
used to control both SO₂ and NOx emissions from the flue gases. A 
reagent aimed at reducing the pollutants is injected into the furnace 
at a temperature
