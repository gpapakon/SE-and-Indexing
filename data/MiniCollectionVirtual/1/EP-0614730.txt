<ABSTRACT>
An impact device includes a cylinder and a plunger (2) 
which is received within the cylinder (1) and movable in forward 

and rearward directions. The plunger (2) includes a first (21) and a 
second (22) pressure receiving surface for receiving pressure 

of a pressurized fluid so as to apply force to the plunger 
in the forward and rearward directions, respectively. An 

additional pressure receiving surface (23) is formed on the 
plunger for receiving the pressure from the pressurized 

fluid so as to apply force in the same direction as one of 
the first and second pressure receiving surfaces. A first 

control device (11) is operable to selectively apply the pressure 
of the pressurized fluid to the additional pressure 

receiving surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact device
as defined in the preamble to claim 1, and
particularly to an impact device suitable for a hydraulic
breaker or a rock drill for crushing a rock base.Conventionally, an impact device is mounted on an arm
of a construction machine such as a hydraulic excavator and
is connected to a hydraulic pump which is normally provided
on the construction machine, so that the impact device is
driven by the hydraulic pump.However, the amount of discharge of hydraulic fluid
varies substantially with the capacity of the hydraulic pump
provided on the construction machines such as hydraulic
excavators. Thus, the performance of the impact device
depends on the amount of discharge of hydraulic fluid from
the hydraulic pump of the construction machine on which the
impact device is mounted.Further, pressure-receiving surfaces formed on a
plunger of the conventional impact device for impact 
movement of the plunger have the same area with each other.
Therefore, if the impact force is to be increased, the
stroke of movement of the plunger must be determined to have
a greater length, with the result that the number of impacts is
reduced. Furthermore, even if the amount of discharge of
the hydraulic pump is larger than the amount of consumption
of the hydraulic fluid in the impact device, the impact
force cannot be increased since the capacity of the
hydraulic pump cannot be fully utilized. Additionally, in
this case, the excess hydraulic fluid must be returned to
a reservoir tank via a pressure control valve, etc.,
with the result that the hydraulic fluid becomes overheated or stained
and that an excessive load is applied to the hydraulic pump.
On the other hand, if the capacity of the hydraulic pump Is
too small as compared with the amount of possible
consumption of the impact device, the operational pressure
is reduced, with the result that the performance of the impact
device is reduced.WO-A-92/21323 discloses a drilling machine which includes a cylinder,
plunger within the cylinder, first and second pressure-receiving surfaces for
forcing the plunger in opposite directions, and an additional pressure-receiving
surface to apply force in the same direction as the first surface under the effect
of control means.It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide an
impact device which is operable to increase the impact force without reducing
the impact number.It is another object of' the present invention to 
provide an impact device which is operable to
