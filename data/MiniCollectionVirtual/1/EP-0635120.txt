<DESCRIPTION>
Torsional vibrations in power transmission shafts are produced by load fluctuations 
or by fluctuations of the power source or transmission system. Detection of these 
vibrations, especially if they can be isolated from other vibrations and noise, is a means of 
early detection of flaws in the transmission system. The smaller the fluctuation which can 
be detected, and the more specific the location of the source, the earlier such flaws can be 
identified so that potentially serious problems can be averted. Indirect means of monitoring, such as microphones or accelerometers - mounted for 
example to a bearing block - can provide a warning when failure is imminent, but the 
information of interest in their signals is partially masked by ordinary vibrations and cannot 
identify the specific source of vibrations. Previous optical means of detecting torsional 
vibrations are either not sensitive enough to detect small fluctuations, or are expensive, 
fragile laboratory devices not suitable for continuous monitoring in the hostile environment 
of a power system. Additionally, many of these systems must be installed before assembly 
of the power system and/or require access to the ends of shafts in the system. It has been found that detailed analysis of torsional variations, for example those that 
recur at the same point during a rotational cycle of a shaft or system of shafts can be used 
to identify wear or damage to gears and other transmission components used to transmit 
power to and receive power from the shaft. For example, a gear with a worn tooth will 
result in uneven application of power to the shaft due to delay in engagement of the worn 
tooth with its mating tooth. Prior art systems do not permit the desired regular monitoring 
and detection of very small recurrent variations in power transfer, and may lack the 
sensitivity to identify developing problems before they have already become audible or 
visible to an experienced mechanic. It would therefore be desirable to provide a system and 
method capable of resolving and reporting very small torsional vibrations which could be 
permanently installed on an oceangoing vessel or in an industrial facility. Hartman and Palmer, in ISA Transactions, Volume 12, pp. 186-190 (1973), disclose 
application of an optical technique to measurement of torsional oscillations on a nonrotating 
beam in a laboratory and were able to measure a resolution of 10-4 arc-seconds. In the 
field, however, the inventors have found that resolution is limited by motion of
