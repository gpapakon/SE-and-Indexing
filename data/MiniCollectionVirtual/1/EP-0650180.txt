<ABSTRACT>
Color display tube of the 3-in-line type having a display screen with a 
pattern of phosphor rows. The display tube has a shield with two long walls, two short 

walls and one gun-sided aperture. Viewed at least in projection, at least one area having 
a decreased magnetic permeability and extending in the longitudinal direction of the 

tube between the edges of the wall and the aperture is present in the material of each 
long wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a color display tube comprising 
an envelope with a longitudinal axis, having a neck portion, a funnel 
portion and a window portion; an electron gun arranged in the neck portion, a display screen having a short central axis and a long central axis and a 
pattern of phosphor elements (for example in the form of rows) on the inner surface of 
the window portion; a color selection means arranged proximate to the display screen; a funnel-shaped shield of a magnetically permeable material having two 
long wall portions parallel to the long axis of the display screen and two short wall 
portions parallel to the short axis of the display screen, and an aperture at the gun-sided 
end, which aperture extends transversely to the longitudinal axis and constitutes an 
aperture for passing electron beams produced by the gun and scanning the display 
screen. A color selection means is herein understood to mean, for example an 
apertured shadow mask sheet or a wire mask. The ratio between the dimension of the long central axis and the 
dimension of the short central axis of the display screen characterizes the picture 
format. In a (color) display tube the earth's magnetic field deflects the electron 
paths, which without any measures may be so large that the electrons impinge upon the 
wrong phosphor (mislanding) and produce a discoloration of the picture. Modern display tubes are provided with an internal magnetic shield to 
limit the deviation of the electron path due to the earth's magnetic field. A complete 
shielding is not possible due to an aperture which is required for the passage of the 
electron beam. A horizontally directed spot displacement caused by the lateral earth's 
magnetic field produces a risk of discoloration in the corners only (N effect). It is 
known from US 4,758,193 that the internal residual field can be influenced by means of  
 
an additional measure in such a way that the electron beam still passes the mask at the 
desired angle. This measure involves the use of a shield with "vertically" directed slits 
(situated in a plane through the longitudinal axis parallel to the short axis of the display 
screen). The internal residual field is then influenced in such a way that there is less 
spot displacement in the horizontal direction. The slits enhance the magnetic resistance 
in the shield in the horizontal direction so that there is more spot displacement in the 
vertical direction. However, for display tubes having phosphor rows extending in this 
direction this
