<ABSTRACT>
A disposable undergarment comprises a basic cloth 
(1) made of fibrous nonwoven fabric elastically stretchable 

in length and width and provided with a waist-opening (6) 
and leg-openings (7). A fluidized elastic material, which 

has rubber-like elasticity when cured, is applied to the 
leg-openings along their peripheral surfaces fully to the 

outer peripheral edges thereof to form ribbon-like elastic 
zones (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable 
undergarment of the pants type formed by bonding front 
and rear bodies along respective opposite side edges at 
waist level, such as incontinence diapers, baby diapers, 
baby training pants and sanitary pants. Such a disposable undergarment of the prior art 
usually employs non-elastic nonwoven fabric as a base 
cloth and elastic members each comprising a plurality of 
thread-like elastic elements or a single tape-like 
elastic member bonded, after being stretched by a 
predetermined elongation percentage, to respective leg-openings 
along peripheral edges thereof by means of hot 
melt type adhesive in order to keep the leg-openings 
fitting around the wearer's legs and thereby to avoid 
excretion leakage possibly occurring around the legs. However, some of the machines for high speed 
production of undergarments are unable to attach said 
elastic members along outer peripheral edges of the 
respective leg-openings and therefore it is forced to 
attach them to the leg-openings along regions inwardly 
spaced from the respective outer peripheral edges. 
Consequently, there are regions having no  
 
elastic members between the respective elastic members 
attached in this manner and the outer peripheral edges of the 
respective leg-openings and these regions correspond to a 
material loss for undergarment. In addition, these regions 
may prevent neatly wearing the undergarment and cause leakage 
of excretion, particularly urine from between these regions 
and the wearer's skin because said regions are apt to be bent 
backward or disengaged from the wearer's skin. Furthermore, 
separately of the elastic members, adhesive must be applied 
to the leg-openings or the elastic members, so the labor cost 
as well as the material cost are correspondingly increased. It is an object of the invention to eliminate the above-mentioned 
problems by applying, instead of the elastic 
members, fluidized elastic material having rubber-like 
elasticity in its cured state to said openings to form 
ribbon-like elastic zones. The object set forth above is achieved, according to the 
invention, by a disposable undergarment comprising a basic 
cloth made of fibrous nonwoven fabric elastically stretchable 
at least in length and width and provided with a waist-opening 
and a pair of leg-openings, characterized in that  
 
fluidized elastic material having rubber-like elasticity in 
its cured state is applied to said leg-openings along their 
peripheral surfaces almost fully to outer

A disposable undergarment comprising a basic cloth 
made of fibrous nonwoven fabric,elastically stretchable at 

least in length and width,and provided with a waist-opening 
and a pair of leg-openings, characterized in that fluidized 

elastic material,having a rubber-like elasticity in its cured 
state,is applied to said leg-openings along their peripheral 

surfaces to or almost fully to the outer peripheral edges 
thereof to form ribbon-like elastic zones, and a 

stretching stress of the respective leg-openings along said 
ribbon-like elastic zones is adjusted to be higher than that 

in the remaining region of the undergarment. 
A disposable undergarment according to Claim 1, 
   said undergarment further comprising an absorbent pad 

having a size smaller than that of said basic cloth and being 
laid upon the inner surface of said basic cloth so that outer 

peripheral edges of said basic cloth may extend outward from 
those of said absorbent pad. 
A disposable undergarment according to Claim 2, 
wherein said absorbent pad is shaped to have a thickness 

gradually decreasing from a region adjacent its opposite side 
edges to its opposite side edges. 
A disposable undergarment according to Claim 2 or 3, 
 

wherein said absorbent pad is intermittently bonded to said 
basic cloth,while its opposite side edges are not bonded to 

said basic cloth.
