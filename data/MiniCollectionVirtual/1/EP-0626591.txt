<ABSTRACT>
A radiation analysis apparatus is provided having means for correcting 
errors in a pulse-height distribution due to differential non-linearities of the analog-to-digital 

converter that is employed for digitising the detector signals. Correction is 
performed by multiplying counts by correction factors so as to form corrected counts 

constituting a corrected pulse-height spectrum. Correction factors are obtained by 
supplying to the analog-to-digital converter a known control-measurement detector 

signal having a known corresponding ideal pulse-height spectrum. Comparison of the 
pulse-height spectrum actually formed upon supplying the control-measurement detector 

signal with the ideal pulse-height spectrum provides correction factors that are stored in 
a memory means. Generator signals obtained during radiation analysis lead to counts to 

be corrected which are supplied to a multiplication means together with respective 
correction factors such that corrected counts are formed constituting a corrected pulse-height 

distribution being supplied to a display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a radiation analysis apparatus according to the
preamble of Claim 1.A radiation analysis apparatus of said kind is known from the published
European patent application EP-A-0 288 116.The known radiation analysis apparatus is an X-ray spectrometer in which
a sample to be examined is irradiated with X-ray radiation. X-ray quanta emitted by the
sample are converted by a radiation detector into an analog detector signal in the form
of detector pulses. Each of these detector pulses is converted into a bit word by an
analog-to-digital converter which bit words constitute a digital signal representing the
height of the detector pulses. The digital outputs of the analog-to-digital converter are
coupled to an address bus of a storage device, thus generating addresses for the storage
device. Each time a detector pulse is converted into a bit word the content of that
address is increased by one incremental unit whereby a stored count for each channel is
generated, thus providing a pulse-height distribution. Said pulse-height distribution
formed in the storage device can be displayed on a cathode ray tube.The analog-to-digital converter inevitably has to some extent differential
non-linearities, giving rise to deviations of the ideal conversion of analog signals
generated by the radiation detector. In the known radiation analysis apparatus errors
arising by the differential non-linearities of the analog-to-digital converter are carried
over into a pulse-height distribution that is displayed on the cathode-ray tube.The problem of differential non-linearity per se is well known.In US patent US 4,352,160 the differential linearity of an analog-to-digital
convertor is measured by a statistical method in order to give any input voltage an equal
chance of being sampled by the convertor. The number of times each possible each
possible output code word occurs is a direct measure of differential non-linearity. This
document contains no indication of solving the problem of the distortion of the pulse-height
distribution.In an article in NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS, Vol.205, 
No.1-2, Jan.'83, pp.167-171 "Fuzzy coarse coding upgrades A/D-conversion for pulse-height
analysis" an A/D-arrangement is disclosed in which the combination of two A/D-convertors
and one D/A-convertor is used. The inherent differential non-linearities of
these convertors are avoided by the combined actions of a sliding scale circuit and a so-called
"shaker" circuit. The latter circuit subtracts a noisy waveform from the

a radiation detector (6) for generating an analog detector signal in the form of
