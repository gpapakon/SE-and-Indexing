<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a hydraulic control circuit for a 
self-propelled lift truck having a hydrostatic transmission, a 

hydraulic lift cylinder (20) for lifting and lowering a load with 
an associated hydraulic lift supply circuit (68), and at least 

one auxiliary hydraulic cylinder (21) for controlling an 
auxiliary function of the truck with an associated auxiliary 

hydraulic supply circuit (86). Hydraulic valve means (24,25,27) 
are operable to control fluid supply to said lift and 

auxiliary supply circuits from an associated hydraulic pump (15). 
According to the invention, the hydraulic valve means directs 

flow from the hydraulic pump into the lift supply circuit through 
at least two separate supply conduits (84,83). While means are 

provided responsive to operation of the lifting cylinder to 
increase the speed of the drive means thereby to increase the 

output from the hydraulic pump, the auxiliary hydraulic cylinder 
and its associated supply circuit are operable by the output from 

the hydraulic pump substantially at the idle speed of the engine 
driving the pump. By splitting the input to the lift supply 

circuit into at least two separate flows, the sizes of all the 
valves can be reduced. Auxiliary functions are powered by 

reduced pump flow which is matched more accurately to the 
requirements of the circuit and the auxiliary cylinder or 

cylinders therein. This means that there is sufficient power to 
operate auxiliary functions at an engine speed below drive 

engagement speed without any danger of stalling the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to self-propelled lift trucks of
the kind which are powered by a hydrostatic transmission
incorporating one or more wheel motors; and more particularly
to a hydraulic control circuit for such a truck.Lift trucks such as fork lift trucks which are powered
by hydrostatic transmissions usually comprise a diesel or gas
engine driving a hydraulic transmission pump which supplies
hydraulic fluid under pressure to one or more wheel motors.
The same engine is used to drive a second hydraulic pump
which supplies pressure to hydraulic cylinders which control
other functions of the truck, such as steering and lifting.Hydrostatic transmissions effectively operate as
stepless automatic transmissions, and can be controlled by
the driver through a conventional speed control pedal with a
direction lever for forward and reverse drive, or through a
cross-linked twin foot pedal arrangement which provides
proportional drive speed in forward or reverse direction in
response to the depression of the respective pedal by the
driver's right or left foot. This latter arrangement means
that the truck does not need a separate direction lever, thus
leaving the drivers' hands free to steer and operate other
functions of the truck.Since maximum drive speed of the hydrostatic
transmission is achieved at full pump delivery, a mechanical
or electrical linkage is provided between the pedal and a
speed controller on the engine which increases engine speed
proportional to pedal depression. A similar engine speed
controller is needed to boost delivery of the second
hydraulic pump to the lifting circuit which controls the
operation of the lift cylinder or cylinders. Maximum hoist
speed requires maximum output from 
the pump, and a mechanism is provided which automatically
speeds up the engine to meet the hydraulic demand in the
lifting circuit when full speed lift is called for. Since
any speeding up of the engine will increase the outputs from
both transmission and lifting pumps, a pressure control valve
is provided in the transmission circuit operable to prevent
any pressure increase in the transmission circuit during a
full rate lifting operation.Since lifting performance is a crucial factor in truck
operation, the size of the hydraulic pump supplying the
lifting and auxiliary circuits is usually determined by the
need to obtain the highest possible lift speed available from
the engine. This in turn determines the size and nature of
the associated valves and controls which operate the lifting
and auxiliary
