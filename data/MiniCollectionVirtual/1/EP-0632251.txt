<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a level surface
monitoring system for a large jig tool for monitoring a
fact as to whether any differential subsiding is caused by
age deterioration or age change to a ground on which a
large jig tool is settled and any deformation over an
allowable range is caused to the large jig tool.In a known art, when large structures or fabrications
such as air crafts or ships are assembled, tools or jigs
having large sizes have been utilized for positioning
respective parts or elements. Since such large jig tool
occupies a large area for settlement, the large jig tool is
likely effected by a ground movement such as ground
subsiding. Particularly, leg portions of the large jig tool
for supporting a body of the large jig tool are likely
partially subsided by the differential subsiding of the
ground, and in such case, the large jig tool will be itself
deformed through the age change.For this reason, the deformation of the large jig tool
due to the ground subsiding is amended or corrected by
adjusting the leg portions thereof by means of, for
example, screw jacks mounted to the respective leg portions
through a periodical inspection, for example, once a year,
in which the deformation of the large jig tool is measured
by using a measuring machine such as transit.However, recently, since it has been required to
assemble a large structure with high assembling precision
of parts or elements thereof, it becomes difficult to
maintain the high assembling precision or performance of
the large jig tool merely through the adjustment in the
inspection or maintenance only once a year, thus providing
a problem. For this reason, it has been required to monitor
the deformation of the large jig tool before the assembling 
or fabrication of a large structure or in a real time.Furthermore, in a prior art, there is provided a further problem
such that when the deformation of the large jig tool is monitored by a
conventional monitoring machine, much manual labor and time are
required, further involving less measuring precision and less
reproductivity.A surface level monitoring system having the features of the
preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-3,949,484. US-A-4,894,924
discloses a surface level monitoring system having one reference liquid-level
sensor means and at least one displacement sensor means. The
float of this system is connected with a vertical stem which guides the
float allowing movement of the float only in the vertical direction. The
stem further transfers the float movement to a

a plurality of displacement sensor means (3) each having a
measuring area;
a communicating tube (4) in which a fluid (9) fills, said
communicating tube (4) being provided with a plurality of openings

(5a) at portions corresponding to the measuring areas of the
