<DESCRIPTION>
 BALE WRAPPER APPARATUSThis invention relates to a bale wrapper apparatus for applying stretchable plastics film wrapping around a bale.The concept of wrapping bales with pre-stretched plastics film is now well established, and especially in relation to the wrapping of bales of agricultural crops, such as hay, straw and grass. In the case of a dried crop e.g. hay or straw, the wrapping serves as weatherproofing i.e. to exclude rain from coming into contact with the baled material which would cause spoilage of the crop; and in the case of a crop still containing a high proportion of water i.e. a low dry matter content, such as newly mown grass which is then baled, the wrapping serves to exclude both rain and atmospheric oxygen and thereby allows fermentation of the crop over a relatively short period of time e.g. two to three weeks, to form silage.Agricultural bales are usually formed as "cuboids" (a rectangular parallelepiped) having a rectangular cross- section or in cylindrical form known as "big bales" or "round bales", and most current designs of bale wrapper apparatus are designed specifically to handle and apply film wrapping to cylindrical bales.One known type of bale wrapper apparatus comprises a rotating platform type of bale wrapper e.g. as disclosed in GB Patent No 2159489, and which comprises a turntable carrying a laterally spaced pair of horizontal rollers on which the cylindrical bale is loaded with its axis extending horizontally, and which rotate the bale about its axis while simultaneously the turntable is rotated about a substantially vertical axis. A fixed support stand is mounted on the apparatus and carries a dispenser reel of stretchable plastics film, and following attachment of the leading end of the film to the bale, (manually or automatically by a film applicator unit as disclosed e.g. in more detail in EP 0367529 Kverneland Underhaug AS), the combined effect of the two rotations applied to the cylindrical bale result in 

withdrawal of film from the reel and which forms helically overlapping windings around the bale.A further known type of bale wrapper apparatus is an orbiting "satellite" type of bale wrapper apparatus e.g. as disclosed in EP 0234763 (Oiestad), and in which the table on which the bale is loaded is non-rotatable, and a support carrying the film dispenser reel is caused to orbit around the bale while the bale is rotated about its axis. This achieves the same result as with the first type of apparatus, and has the advantage of avoiding the necessity to rotate
