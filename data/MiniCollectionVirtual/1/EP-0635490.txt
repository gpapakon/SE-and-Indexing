<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing N-ethylcarbazole of the 
formula I, which comprises reacting a carbazole of 

the formula II, 

 
where R is hydrogen or ethoxycarbonyl, with diethyl 

carbonate. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction is carried out under base catalysis, preferred 

catalysts being tertiary amines, pyridine 
derivatives, alkali metal salts of amines, alkali 

metal or alkaline earth metal salts of carbazole, 
alkali metal alkoxides, alkaline earth metal alkoxides 

or hydroxides, oxides, carbonates or phosphates 
of the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals or 

mixtures of these substances. 
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
catalyst is used in an amount of from 0.05 to 20 mol 

percent, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mol percent, 
based on the carbazole of the formula II used. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to  
 

3, wherein the reaction is carried out between 130 
and 320째C, preferably between 180 and 300째C, particularly 

preferably between 220 and 280째C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the carbazole of the formula II, if 

desired a catalyst, if desired a solvent and if 
desired a part of the diethyl carbonate are 

initially charged and the diethyl carbonate, or if 
applicable the remaining diethyl carbonate, is 

metered in at the reaction temperature during the 
reaction. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein carbazole of the formula IIa 


 
is reacted with diethyl carbonate, where catalysts 

used are hydroxides, oxides, carbonates, phosphates 
or ethoxides of the alkali metals or the alkaline 

earth metals or the carbazole salts formed from 
these metals or mixtures of these compounds and 

where the reaction is carried out in molten N-ethylcarbazole 
or in diethyl carbonate or in a mixture 

thereof. 
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
catalyst used is potassium hydroxide, potassium 

carbonate or potassium ethoxide or a mixture of 
these compounds. 
The process as claimed in claim 6 and/or 7, wherein 
the reaction is carried out between 130 and 320째C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 6 to 
8, wherein the diethyl carbonate is used in an  

 
amount of from 1.1 to 2.5 mol, preferably 1.1 to 

1.8 mol, based on the carbazole of the formula IIa 
used. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein N-ethoxycarbonylcarbazole of the formula 

IIb 

 
is reacted with diethyl carbonate, where the diethyl 

carbonate is used in an amount of from 0.1 to 
1.0 mol, preferably from 0.3 to 0.8 mol, based on 

the carbazole of the formula IIb used, and where the 
reaction is carried out without an additional solvent.
