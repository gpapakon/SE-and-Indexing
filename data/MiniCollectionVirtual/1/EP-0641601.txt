<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural hammermill achieves fine grind at practical 
production rates. Hammer tip speeds of 7620m/min are 

provided at 1800 rpm by providing hammers (140) of 
sufficient length to provide a tip path diameter of 

approximately 1.37m. In order to avoid excessive 
centrifugal stresses on the hammer rotor and components, 

hammers are tapered to reduce tip mass. Because of the 
high tip speeds, fine grind of feed grains is obtained 

usually with only a single impact of the hammers. Thus, 
since it is not necessary to retain the grain in the 

grinding chamber (150) for multiple hammer impacts, a large 
apertured screen can be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to grain processing 
machinery and more particularly to agricultural hammermills 
for impact grinding of grains. In the agricultural industry, cereal grains and feed grains 
are commonly dried, ground, mixed, conditioned and 
pelletised or flaked. Depending upon the formulation being 
prepared, conditioning and pelleting may require that the 
grain be ground to different degrees of coarseness. Thus, 
one application may require grain particles of 1000 microns 
or larger size while others may require sizes of 
500 microns or smaller (1 micron = 1µm). Grinding is most often accomplished in hammermills in which 
a rotor within a chamber with an apertured wall has a 
number of hammers pinned about its periphery. When the 
rotor spins, the hammers are centrifugally extended so that 
they pass very close to the chamber wall and strike any 
objects which pass through the space between the rotor and 
the chamber wall. The axis of the rotor is horizontal, and 
the chamber wall, viewed along the rotor axis, is 
approximately tear-drop shaped. The grain is fed into the 
narrow (top) part of the chamber and the ground particles 
of grain are discharged through the apertured chamber wall 
(screen). Comminution of the grain occurs by impacts with 
the hammers and the screen. Depending upon the type of grain, its state of dryness and 
the operating conditions of the mill, a single impact from 
a hammer will produce a certain distribution of particle 
sizes. The fine fraction of the particles will pass 
through the screen while the coarse particles will strike 
the screen, shatter further, rebound into the path of the  
 
hammers, and be struck again. After a few impacts, all the 
particles will be fine enough to pass through the screen. 
Of course, the trajectories of the particles also affect 
the likelihood of passage of the particles through the 
screen. The most common approach for producing fine grind grain 
particles is to use a screen having fine apertures. This 
retains the particles within the chamber for a longer time 
and, thus, subjects them to additional hammer impacts. 
However, this limits capacity due to reduced particle and 
air flow capacity and also due to increased screen plugging 
when high moisture is encountered in the grain or as 
ambient humidity. In addition, fine aperture screens are 
much more expensive than are coarse aperture screens. Agricultural hammermills usually operate with constant 
speed motors at either 1800 rpm or 3600 rpm. The higher

<CLAIMS>
An agricultural hammermill for fine grinding of feed 
grains, comprising: 

   a housing (100) having a grain inlet (110) in an upper 
portion, a ground particle discharge (200) in a lower 

portion, and a grinding chamber (150) between said inlet 
and said discharge; 

   an apertured screenwall (120), surrounding said 
grinding chamber, having an open top adjacent said inlet 

(110) for receiving grain, having apertures of at least 
2000 microns, being formed as a portion of a horizontal 

cylinder above said discharge (200), and having straight 
tangential portions (115) converging to said inlet (110); 

   a rotor on a rotatably driven shaft (125) mounted 
coaxially within said horizontal cylinder portion of said 

apertured screenwall, said rotor comprising a plurality of 
discs (130) mounted on said shaft, each said disc having at 

least two hammer support pivot pins (135) symmetrically 
disposed near the periphery of said disc; 

   means for rotating said shaft and rotor at a 
substantially constant speed of 1800 rpm; and 

   a plurality of hammers (145, 146), one said hammer 
(140) being pivotally supported on each said pin; 

   characterised in that said hammers each have a length 
such that, when said rotor is rotated at 1800 rpm, the 

outboard tip of said hammer swings at substantially 25,000 
feet per minute (7620m/min) along a path in close proximity 

to the cylindrically formed portion of said screenwall. 
A hammermill according to claim 1, wherein each said 
hammer (140) has a middle portion (144) tapered from a 

portion (143) of maximum width near said pin (141) to a 
portion (142) of minimum width near said outboard tip. 
A hammermill according to claim 1 or 2 and further 
comprising a grain deflector (90) extending downwardly 

across said inlet (110) from a lower edge thereof, said 
deflector serving to prevent reflow of grain particles into 

said inlet from said grinding chamber (150) by occluding a 
line of sight between upwardly moving hammer tips and said 

inlet. 
A method of fine grinding grain using an agricultural 
hammermill for fine grinding of feed grains having an 

apertured screenwall (120) surrounding a grinding chamber 
(150), said screenwall having apertures of at least 2000 

microns and being formed as a portion of a horizontal 
cylinder above a discharge (200), there being a rotor

hammers (145, 146), one said hammer (140) being pivotally 

supported on each said pin, said hammers each have a

rotor at a substantially constant speed of 1800 rpm, 
characterised in that the outboard tip of said hammer 

swings at substantially 25,000 feet per minute (7620m/min) 
along a path in close proximity to the cylindrically formed 

portion of said screenwall.
