<ABSTRACT>
A photographic printing and developing apparatus 
includes an exposure section (1) in which a standard exposure is 

effected on a photosensitive material (4) under predetermined 
conditions in a manner similar to that for preparing a 

conventional control strip. The apparatus further includes 
a device for measuring the density (15) of the developed 

photosensitive material, and a device for displaying (7) the 
condition of the processing solution which is determined 

based on the measured density. A negative film is prepared 
for the standard exposure. The apparatus is provided with a 

control section which selectively uses different light 
sources for ordinary printing and for the standard exposure. 

The control section reads in the measured density of the 
photosensitive material (4) after developing process, and 

calculates the condition of the processing solution based on 
the measured density. It is judged whether or not the 

condition of the processing solution is within an usable 
range, and the results of judgment are displayed (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a photographic printing and developing
apparatus for continuously performing printing and
developing of a photosensitive material, comprising:
standard exposure means for exposing a photosensitive
material under predetermined standard exposure conditions for
determining the condition of a processing solution;density measurement means for measuring a density of the
photosensitive material which has been printed by said standard
exposure means and has been then developed; andjudging and displaying means for judging the condition of
the processing solution based on the density measured by said
density measurement means and for displaying the results of
the judgment;wherein said standard exposure means comprises a negative
film used only for the standard exposure which is formed with
at least one pattern having a predetermined density, and a
light source which emits light in accordance with the standard
exposure conditions.An apparatus of this type is known from US-A-3 995 959,
EP-A-149 850 and WO-A-82 01940.More generally, the invention relates to a photographic
printing and developing apparatus for printing and developing
a photosensitive material, and more particularly to a photographic
printing and developing apparatus with which the condition
of a processing solution is monitored for controlling
the processing solution. Conventional photographic printing and developing
apparatuses for printing and developing photosensitive
materials include an exposure section, a developing section,
a drying section, etc. Currently, automatic photographic
printing and developing apparatuses which include a CPU for
controlling various factors which affect the printing and
developing processes are widely used. In the progress of
automatic printing and developing apparatuses, the greatest
care is taken for the control of a processing solution used
in the developing process.For example, there have been used a test print as
disclosed in US-A-3 995 959, EP-A-149 850, or WO-A-82
01940, in which a test print that has been printed
and developed is analyzed with a densitometer for the
density of the developed test print to thereby determine the
condition of the processing solution.However, use of the test print is not very much
convenient because, for example, the test print must be
exposed to light from a special light source. Therefore,
actual controlling of a processing solution of the
developing section of a photographic printing and developing
apparatus is generally carried out by the use of a
photos
