<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relatates to a unitized multilayer 
circuit structure comprising a plurality of insulating layers, 
a plurality of vias formed in said insulating layers, and a 
magnetic material containing region. Such a unitized multilayer circuit structure is known from 
IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, June 1973, Vol. 16, No. 1, 
page 43.  
 The disclosed invention is directed generally to 
hybrid multilayer circuit structures. Hybrid multilayer circuit structures, also known as 
hybrid microcircuits, implement the interconnection and 
packaging of discrete circuit devices, and generally 
include a unitized multilayer circuit structure either 
formed on a single substrate layer using thick film or thin 
film techniques, or as a multilayer substrate comprising a 
plurality of integrally fused insulating layers (e.g., 
ceramic layers) having conductor traces disposed therebetween. 
The discrete circuit devices (e.g., integrated 
circuits) are commonly mounted on the top insulating layer 
so as not to be covered by another insulating layer or on 
a insulating layer having die cutouts formed thereon to 
provide cavities for the discrete devices. Passive components 
such as capacitors, inductors, and resistors can be 
formed on the same layer that supports the discrete 
devices, for example, by thick film processes, or they can 
be formed between the insulating layers, for example, also 
by thick film processes. Electrical interconnection of the 
conductors and components on the different layers is  
 
achieved with vias or holes appropriately located and formed 
in the insulating layers and filled with conductive material, 
whereby the conductive material is in contact with predetermined 
conductive traces between the layers that extend over or under 
the vias. A traditional manner for incorporating ferromagnetic 
structures with unitized multilayer circuit structures is the 
use of discrete ferromagnetic material in components or structures 
external to the unitized multilayer circuit structure, 
which makes the resulting product relatively large and heavy. In view of this, it is an object of the invention to provide 
for ferromagnetic structures that can be implemented in unitized 
multilayer circuit structures.  
 This object is achieved with a unitized multilayer circuit 
structure, mentioned at the outset, wherein said vias are made 
of a ferromagnetic material and include a plurality of columns 
so as to define said magnetic material containing region. It is an advantage of the invention to
