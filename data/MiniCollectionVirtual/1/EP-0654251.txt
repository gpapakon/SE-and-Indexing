<ABSTRACT>
A laser cutting apparatus which comprises a 
laser emitter 11 capable of outputting a laser beam 4 

in pulses and a laser beam irradiation member 1; a 
dental-crown polishing and washing member 12 having an 

injection member 2 through which air 6, water 8 and 
polishing material 7 are output toward a laser-beam-irradiated 

surface; and a control member 14 capable of 
controlling the operation of the laser emitter 11 and 

the dental-crown polishing and washing member 12, 
wherein the laser beam irradiation member 1 and the 

injection member 2 are combined with each other by 
means of an adapter 10 disposed therebetween, thereby 

enabling both the laser beam irradiation member 1 and 
the injection member 2 to be held and operated by a 

single hand. By employing this laser cutting 
apparatus, a high-energy laser beam can be used in 

medical and dental fields for removing soft dentin to 

form a cavity, without the occurrence of problems due 
to the irradiation of a high-energy laser beam, such 

as the production and deposition of a carbonised layer 
in the dentin, the formation of a fused layer in the 

dentin, the occurrence of a cavity margin having an 
irregular configuration, and the cracking and damaging 

of the dental pulp attributed to a temperature rise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting apparatus
employing a laser emitter, which is for use in medical and dental
fields.Conventionally, with respect to a cutting apparatus employing
a laser emitter which is for use in medical and dental fields, a laser
beam has been used experimentally for removing soft dentin.However, it is known that, when a laser beam is used in
medical and dental fields for removing soft dentin to thereby form a
cavity, problems due to the irradiation of a high-energy laser beam
occur such as the production and deposition of a carbonised layer in
the dentin, the formation of a fused layer in the dentin, the
occurrence of a cavity margin having an irregular configuration, or
the cracking and damaging of the dental pulp attributed to a
temperature rise.WO 90/11728 teaches a process for destroying and removing
material from teeth by means of pulsed infrared laser beams. To
this end, the material of the teeth is coated, prior to irradiation with
the laser beams, with a layer of a liquid which absorbs the laser
radiation. JP 1091848 which forms the basis for the preamble of claim 1,
teaches the use of a semiconductor laser
generator with a water supply pipe and an air supply pipe parallelly
provided in the leading end head part of the apparatus for use in
medical and dental fields for forming a cavity.The inventors have made extensive and intensive studies
with a view toward developing a laser cutting apparatus which
solves the above-mentioned problems. As a result, it has
unexpectedly been found that the above-mentioned 
problems can be successfully solved by a novel
laser cutting apparatus in which a laser emitter is
combined with a dental-crown polishing and washing
member. The present invention has been completed on
the basis of the above finding.It is, therefore, an object of the present
invention to provide a laser cutting apparatus free
from the above drawbacks of the prior art.The foregoing and other objects, features and
advantages of the present invention will become
apparent from the following detailed description and
appended claims taken in connection with the
accompanying drawings in which:-
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view showing the
construction of one form of the laser cutting
apparatus according to the present invention; andFigure 2 is a timing chart showing one example
of the timing of operations of the laser emitter and
the dental-crown polishing and washing member during
the operation of the laser cutting apparatus of the
present invention.For attaining the

<CLAIMS>
A laser cutting apparatus for use in medical and dental
fields for forming a cavity, comprising:


a laser emitter (11) capable of outputting a laser beam
continuously or in pulses, and a laser beam irradiation member (1);
a washing member (12) capable of outputting air (6) and water (8) to a
laser-beam-irradiated surface, and an injection member (2) adapted to inject

the output air (6) and water (8) and connected to the washing member (12);
and
a control member (14) adapted to control the operations of the laser
emitter (11) and the washing member (12),

wherein said laser beam irradiation member (1) and said injection
member (2) are combined with each other by means of an adapter (10)

disposed therebetween, thereby enabling both of the laser beam irradiation
member (1) and the injection member (2) to be held and operated by a single

hand,

characterised in that said washing member (12) is capable of outputting
not only air (6) and water (8) but also a polishing material (7) to the laser-beam-irradiated

surface to thereby function as a dental-crown polishing and
washing member (12), and that said injection member (2) is adapted to inject

not only the output air (6) and water (8), but also the polishing material (7).
The laser cutting apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control
member (14) is capable of commanding said laser emitter (11) so that the

laser beam is output continuously or in pulses and so that the duration of each
pulse and the intervals between the pulses are arbitrarily set when the laser

beam is output in pulses;
 
said control member (14) is also capable of setting the output and the

timing of operation of the dental-crown polishing and washing member (12) so
that the air (6), water (8) and polishing material (7) are injected during the

intervals between the laser beam pulses; and further capable of memorising
set values of operation conditions of the laser emitter (11) and the dental-crown

polishing and washing member (12).
