<ABSTRACT>
The invention utilizes two separate LI stack depositions and etches. In the first step, a layer of oxide etch stop (24) and a layer (26) of TEOS oxide are deposited to form a first LI stack. This stac is then contact etched, filled, and polished. A second LI stack is then formed by deposition of a doped silane oxide layer (30) that is contact etched, filled, and polished. The method produces an ILD with a first layer of oxide etch stop (24), a second layer (26) of undoped TEOS oxide, and a final layer of doped silane oxide (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a method for simplifying manufacture of a semiconductor
device that includes an interlayer dielectric (TLD) stack and local interconnects (LI). In particular
the invention relates to a method of manufacture that provides for separate LI depositions and
contact etches. An oxide etch stop and an undoped silane oxide form a first LI stack that is etched
and filled. A second LI stack of silane oxide is formed containing sections that are doped with
phosphorous. This second stack is etched and then filled.Premetal interlayer dielectrics are typically used to isolate metal interconnect layers from
underlying devices. Conventional methods for creating ILDs can include numerous fabrication steps
in multiple processing tools, resulting in high production costs and high device defect rates due to
the amount of handling required to complete the fabrication.U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 08/559,054 streamlines this process by creating the
ILD using in situ deposition in a single fabrication tool. This reduces the number of handling steps
required to create an ILD. The method involves the deposition of a three layer ILD stack with a first
layer of undoped silicon dioxide (generated from silane and oxygen) beneath a gettering layer of
phosphorous doped silicon dioxide (also from silane and oxygen), followed by a final layer of
undoped silicon dioxide (generated from TEOS and oxygen). Silicon dioxide created from silane
and oxygen is referred to below as silane oxide, and silicon dioxide created from TEOS and oxygen
is referred to below as TEOS oxide. The depositions are performed in situ with a single fabrication
tool where each subsequent layer is deposited after the previous layer. No intervening handling steps
are required.When local interconnects (LIs) are added to this process, an oxide etch stop is required
under the ILD. Addition of this etch stop results in a four layer stack where the etch stop is followed
by the three layer ILD of undoped silane oxide, phosphorous-doped silane oxide, and undoped 
TEOS oxide. The four layer stock is
difficult to etch because the four layers have
different etch rates. Removing the doped silane layer would allow for more uniform
contact etching resulting in more uniform contact (L1) opening for deposition of the
LI. However, removal of the doped silane layer would also reduce the gettering
capabilities of the ILD.EP-A-0 194 950 describes a high temperature interconnect system for an
integrated circuit. The interconnect system employs
