<ABSTRACT>
To provide a fastener for wire harness, which is 
formed to be one-piece and is capable of firmly holding a 

member having a large diameter as well as small diameter. 
A fastener 1 has a body 6 to come into contact with a 
part of the periphery of a wire harness 3, and an arm 12 

whose one end is connected to the body via hinge 8 and the 
other end is provided with an engagement portion 10 to come 

into engagement with an engagement portion 9 of the body, 
the arm bending so as to form a ring in association with 

the body. The arms are formed with a first holding member 
21 extending from a point close to the hinge 8 along the 

arm. The body 6 is formed with a second holding member 25 
which extends from the body to get between the arm and the 

first holding member 21 when the arm is engaged with the 
body. Each of the holding members is tapered to the thinner 

toward the end. When the arm is in engagement with the 
body, the two holding members are positioned between such 

a member as the wire harness and the arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastener to hold an 
elongated member such as a wire harness, and particularly 
to a fastener for wire harness comprising a body to come 
into contact with the outer surface of the elongated member 
and an arm which is connected via a hinge with the body and 
is provided with, on its free end, an engagement portion to 
come into engagement with an engagement portion of the 
body, the arm bending so as to form a ring in association 
with the body when the arm is in engagement with the body. Japanese U.M. Publication No. 2-40371, for example, 
discloses a fastener comprising a body to hold an elongated 
member such as a wire harness or a pipe by coming in 
contact with the outer surface of an elongated member, and 
an arm which is connected to the body via a hinge. The arm 
is provided with, on a free end thereof, an engagement 
portion to engage with an engagement portion of the body, 
and is bent to form a ring in association with the body 
when it is in engagement with the engagement portion of the 
body. This publicly known fastener is convenient in that 
the arm is provided with a holding member to press the wire 
harness toward the body so that wire harnesses having 
different diameters can be held. Besides this fastener, 
the ones disclosed in Japanese Patent laid-Open 
No. 55-79264 and Japanese U.M. Publication No. 4-5754 are 
capable of holding wire harnesses regardless of their 
diameters.  Among the publicly known fasteners stated above, the 
one described in U.M. Publication No. 2-40371 has the 
drawback that a space left between the holding member and 
the arm causes the wire harness to be displaced when a 
larger force to open than the holding force of the holding 
member is exerted on the holding member due to vibrations 
of the vehicle, body or the like. The fastener described in 
Patent Laid-Open No. 55-79264 has a pair of coupling arms 
respectively having serrated teeth to mesh with each other 
and a wire harness or the like is held between the paired 
coupling arms. When a large-diameter wire harness or the 
like is held, however, the depth of mesh between the 
serrated teeth is reduced to lower the coupling strength. 
On the contrary, if a small-diameter wire harness or the 
like is held, the teeth mesh with each other so deeply that 
a high inserting force is required to couple the arms. In 
addition, the arms are in such a configuration that they 
are disengaged by being slid to either side and this gives 
rise to the drawback that they tend to get
