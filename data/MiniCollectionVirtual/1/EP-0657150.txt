<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the excision and removal of tissue, such as the 
lens of the eye includes a pencil-like handpiece (11) having a 

cannula probe (18) extending from the distal end thereof. The 
probe includes an inner jet tube (19) to direct a high pressure 

jet of fluid toward a tissue target, and an outer concentric 
aspiration tube (21) to aspirate and remove fluid and tissue. 

The jet tube is recessed proximally within the concentric 
aspiration tube, and the aspiration tube has an end area 

significantly larger than the end area of the jet tube. These 
factors cooperate so that the negative pressure exerted by the 

aspiration tube creates a suction force that offsets and 
exceeds the force of the fluid jet. The jet tube is connected 

to a fluid pressure system including a positive displacement 
pump (32), a pressure regulator (33), safety release (34), 

control valve (36), and a pulse former (37). The jet tube 
emits pulses of high pressure fluid that impinge reiteratively 

on the target, creating shock waves that fracture and emulsify 
the lens tissue, and the fluid also acts as a solvent to 

transport the emulsified tissue into the aspiration tube. The 
handpiece also includes a vacuum bypass port disposed to be 

selectively occluded by a finger of the surgeon, so that vacuum 
pressure may be released immediately when needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to excision and removal of tissue in 
surgical procedures, and more specifically to the use of fluid jet means for excising 
and removing tissue. In particular, the invention is directed toward the 
emulsification and removal of the lens of the eye to treat cataracts and similar 
disorders. In recent years the treatment of cataracts through surgical techniques has 
become routine and highly successful. Generally, the affected lens of the eye is 
removed from its capsule within the eye, and a lens prosthesis is installed within 
the capsule. Through prudent choice of prosthesis and refractive power, it is often 
possible to provide normal vision to a patient who would otherwise be sightless. The step of removing the cataract-bearing lens was originally found to be 
difficult when performed by traditional surgical techniques. An incision 
sufficiently large to permit removal of the hard lens as a unitary object creates 
trauma to the delicate ocular structures, and results in prolonged recovery and 
patient discomfort. Moreover, it is generally considered vital to maintain the 
integrity of the posterior wall of the lens capsule to prevent the fibrous vitreous 
humour of the posterior chamber from invading the anterior chamber of the eye 
and affecting the iris and other important structures. The capsule is easily 
damaged by traditional surgical techniques.  As a result of these constraints, new techniques such as micro-cutters and 
acoustic emulsification have been introduced to increase the safety of the cataract 
removal procedure and decrease the trauma to the eye. In the former technique an 
inner needle reciprocates within an outer sheath that includes an intake port; 
vacuum pressure applied to the inner needle pulls tissue into the port, the end of 
the needle shears it off, and it is drawn away by the vacuum-induced flow through 
the needle. In this manner a hard object such as the ocular lens may be cut away 
incrementally and removed through a small puncture hole. In the latter technique 
ultrasound energy is directed toward the lens via an acoustic probe to fracture and 
emulsify the lens, and a vacuum channel then removes the lens detritus. Although these techniques are generally successful, they also have 
limitations. Micro-cutters may fail to remove all of the lens tissue, and the 
instrument itself may puncture the posterior wall of the lens capsule. Likewise, 
the acoustic probe used in acoustic emulsification is limited in the amplitude of 
energy
