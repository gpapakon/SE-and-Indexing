<ABSTRACT>
A dashboard (2) for a motor vehicle extends in front of the driver's and front passenger's seats across the width of the interior and has an outer skin (5) which is provided with a multiplicity of small apertures (6) which are distributed across a region which is on the side facing the front passenger seat. The outer skin is made of a plastic material which is dimensionally stable regardless of temperature and a dashboard strengthening structure which is provided beneath the outer skin has, in the region of the front passenger seat, an opening to permit the passage of a front passenger seat airbag. The apertures are arranged as perforations (6) which permit the outer skin to be torn off in the region of the opening, the perforations distributed across the dashboard being arranged so as to match the outlines of the opening in such a way that the potential region of emergence of the airbag cannot be detected.

<CLAIMS>
A dashboard for a motor vehicle, which extends across 
the width of an interior in front of a driver's and a 

passenger's seat and which has an outer skin (5) with a 
plurality of orifices (6) distributed at least over the 

region of the passenger side,
characterised in that
 
the outer skin (5) is made from a moulded plastics 

material that retains its form irrespective of 
temperature, a dashboard facia panel (8) provided 

underneath the outer skin (5) in the region of the 
passenger's seat (4) has a passage orifice for a 

passenger air-bag, the orifices (6) are arranged as 
perforations which allow the outer skin (5) to be torn 

open in the region of the passage orifice and the 
perforations distributed across the dashboard (2) are 

arranged in a pattern matching the contours of the 
passage orifice such that the potential region through 

which the air-bag will potentially emerge is not 
perceptible. 
A dashboard as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the passage orifice is covered in a known manner by means 

of a swivel-mounted flap (9) on the dashboard facia panel 
(8) and a soft, energy-absorbing intermediate layer is 

provided between the dashboard facia panel (8) and the 
outer skin. 
A dashboard as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
several air vents are provided in the dashboard facia 

panel (8), through which air can be directed in a known 
manner into the interior through the perforations.
