<ABSTRACT>
A scheme for controlling a congestion in the 
communication network, capable of realizing a recovery from 

the congestion state by the operation at the lower layer 
level for the communication data transfer alone, without 

relying on the upper layer protocol to be defined at the 
terminals. In a communication network including first and 

second node systems, a flow of communication data 
transmitted from the first node system to the second node 

system is monitored and regulated by using a monitoring 

parameter. On the other hand, an occurrence of congestion 
in the second node system is detected according to 

communication data transmitted from the second node system, 
and the monitoring parameter used in monitoring and 

regulating the flow of communication data is changed 
according to a detection of the occurrence of congestion in 

the second node system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scheme for controlling a congestion in a communication network such as an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network.In operating the communication network, the communication network can fall into a congestion state when the communication data exceeding the processing capacity of the communication network are concentrated onto one node system constituting the communication network due to the occurrence of an unpredictable fluctuation in the communication data flow or a fault condition in the network. In this congestion state, the terminal utilizing the communication network cannot receive the service requested to the network in advance, so that there is a need to carry out the congestion control at the communication network in order to recover from the congestion state such that the intensity, the spread, and the duration of the congestion state can be minimized.As a scheme for such a congestion control, in the ATM network for example, the controlling to discard the cells with low cell loss priority level at the network side is recommended. Also, in the frame relay, the occurrence of the congestion is explicitly notified to the terminal from the system fallen into the congestion state such that the terminal side can recognize the occurrence of the congestion on the network side and the controlling to lower the transmission speed of the communication data such as the window flow control or the rate control can be carried out at the terminal side.For example, IEICE Transactions on Communications, Vol. E75-B, No. 11 November 1992, pages 1199-1207, "Rate-Based Congestion Control in High Speed Packet-Switching Networks" by Hiroshi Inai et al. describes a rate-based congestion control scheme aimed at obtaining high throughput and fair sharing of the communication resources. In the scheme, each intermediate node informs its congestion status to the source node. Two kinds of control packets are used for this mechanism. One (a choke packet) is to throttle the rate and another (a loosen packet) is to allow increase of the rate. The source node initiates transmission with a low rate and increases the rate slowly to avoid a rapid increase of the packet queueing at an intermediate node. When the source node receives a choke packet, it decreases the rate rapidly to relieve congestion as soon as possible. The source node upon receipt a loosen packet increases the rate slowly again.XIV International Switching Symposium, Yokohama, Japan, October 1992, pages 229-233, "A General
