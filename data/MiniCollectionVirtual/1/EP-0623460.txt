<ABSTRACT>
Composite material for plastic caps, especially screw caps (screw-tops), providing both sealing against liquids and impermeability to gases, characterised in that it comprises, joined together into a coherent multilayer structure, at least one central layer (4) made of a plastic having a gas-barrier effect and a high modulus of rigidity, two outer layers (7) placed on either side of the central layer and consisting of a plastic having a low modulus of rigidity, the outer layers each having a thickness greater than the thickness of the central layer, and between the central layer (4) and each outer layer (7), an interlayer (5) made of a material of the same family as the outer layer, but with a high modulus of rigidity.

A composite seal for a plastic cap (2), notably a screw
cap, for the closure of receptacles (3), providing both

imperviousness to liquids and impermeability to gases,
comprising a disk (1) with a multilayer structure with a

median layer (4) made of a plastic with the effect of a
barrier to gases, and two external layers (7) made of

plastic disposed either side of said median layer,
characterised by the fact that said disk (1), designed to be

added into the cap in order to provide, on its own,
imperviousness to liquids and impermeability to gases,

comprises, on each side of a median layer (4) of maximum
thickness 250 µm, made of a plastic having a high modulus of

rigidity equal to or greater than 1300 MPa, an external
layer (7) with a thickness greater than the thickness of the

median layer, made of a plastic having a low modulus of
rigidity less than or equal to 300 MPa.
A seal according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact
that the disk also comprises, between the median layer (4)

and each external layer (7), an intermediate layer (5) made
of a material of the same family as the external layer, but

with a high modulus of rigidity.
A seal according to Claim 2, characterised by the fact
that the intermediate layers (5) are glued to the median

layer (4) and the external layers (7) are connected by hot
calendering to the intermediate layers (5).
A seal according to any one of the previous claims,
characterised by the fact that the material of the external

layers (7) has a modulus of rigidity between 100 and 300
MPa. 
A seal according to any one of the previous claims,
characterised by the fact that the material of the median

layer (4) has a modulus of rigidity between 1300 and 2200
MPa.
A seal according to any one of the previous claims,
characterised by the fact that the median layer (4) is

composed of a PET, PA, PVDC or EVOH sheet with a thickness
between 100 and 250 µm.
A seal according to any one of the previous claims,
characterised by the fact that each external layer (7) is

composed of a PP elastomer sheet with a thickness between
300 and 550 µm.
A seal according to any one of Claims 2 to 7,
characterised by the fact that the material of the

intermediate layers (5) has a modulus of rigidity similar to
that of the material of the median layer (4).
A seal according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised by the
fact that each intermediate layer (5) is composed of a PP

film with a thickness between 10 and 50 µm.
A seal according to any one of Claims 2 to 9,
characterised by the fact that the intermediate layers (5)

are connected to the median layer (4) by a polyurethane
adhesive.
