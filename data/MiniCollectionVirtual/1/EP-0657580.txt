Dryer section of a paper making machine comprising at least one
single-row dryer group having a plurality of dryer cylinders, at least

one two-row dryer group having a plurality of dryer cylinders and
arranged after the single-row dryer group and a steam supply device

which cooperates with the dryer cylinders, characterised by a steam
control/regulating device which controls/regulates the quantity of

steam supplied to the dryer cylinders and/or the steam pressure in
the dryer cylinders such that a first group (23c to 26c) of the dryer

cylinders of the two-row dryer group (40) has a higher vapour pressure
than a following second group (27c to 30c) of the two-row dryer

group.
Dryer section in accordance with claim 1, characterised by a first
steam supply device (60) which supplies steam under pressure to a

first number of dryer cylinders (1c to 22c) for the heating of these
dryer cylinders, a second steam supply device which supplies steam

with a first pressure value to the first group (23c to 26c) of the dryer
cylinders of the two-row dryer group, with the first group having a

plurality of sequential dryer cylinders, and by a third steam supply
device which supplies steam to the second group (27c to 30c) of the

dryer cylinders of the two-row dryer group, with the second group
(27c to 30c) of the dryer cylinders having at least two adjacent dryer

cylinders in the transport direction.
Dryer section in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that the
second and the third steam supply devices are so set that the temperature 

of the first group (23c to 26c) of the dryer cylinders of the
two-row dryer group is greater than the temperature of the second

group (27c to 30c) of the dryer cylinders of the two-row group.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the first group (23c to 26c) of the two-row dryer

group includes at least four dryer cylinders, and in that the second
group of the two-row dryer group likewise includes at least four

dryer cylinders which follow the first group - in the transport direction.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the two-row dryer group forms the end of the dryer

section.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the second group of the dryer cylinders (27c to 30c)

of the two-row dryer group are the last dryer cylinders of the dryer
section.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the first steam supply device supplies steam at a

greater pressure to the corresponding first number (1c to 22c) of
dryer cylinders than the steam pressure delivered from the third

steam supply device to the second group of dryer cylinders of the
two-row dryer group.
Dryer section in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
first number of dryer cylinders (1c to 22c) is greater than the second 

number (23c to 30c) of the dryer cylinders of the first and second
groups of the two-row dryer group.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the first number (1c to 22c) of dryer cylinders is

separated into a plurality of single row dryer groups and in that in
each case an endless dryer felt belt and/or dryer screen belt is associated

with each dryer group of the first number of dryer cylinders,
with the respective dryer felt belt or dryer screen belt being alternatingly

guided around a dryer cylinder and a paper web guide roll
of the respective dryer cylinder.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that each dryer felt belt and/or dryer screen belt of each
dryer group of the first number is guided over the corresponding

dryer cylinder such that the dryer felt belt or the dryer screen belt
brings the first side of the paper web into contact with each of the

dryer cylinders of the first number when the paper web and the
dryer felt belt or dryer screen belt lying above the paper web wraps

around the dryer cylinders.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the paper web guide device includes suction rolls,

with the suction rolls being arranged between sequential neighbouring
dryer cylinders of the row along the transport path so that

the suction rolls cooperate with the paper web such that the paper
web and the respective dryer felt belt or dryer screen belt wraps

partly around each of the dryer cylinders of the first number. 
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a corresponding first endless dryer felt belt and/or

dryer screen belt is guided in the second number (23c to 30c) of
dryer cylinders about each of the dryer cylinders of the first row and

is supported by means of the respective guide device in order to
guide the paper web over the first row of dryer cylinders, with the

first side of the paper web coming into contact with each dryer cylinder
of the first row, and in that a second endless dryer felt belt or

dryer screen belt is guided around each of the dryer cylinders of the
second row and supported by the respective guide device in order to

guide the paper web over the dryer cylinders of the second row, with
the second side of the paper web coming into contact with the cylinders

of the second row.
Dryer section in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the first number of dryer cylinders and the guide

device are so arranged that the one side of the paper web which
comes into contact with the cylinders of the first row is the lower

side of the paper web, and in that the second number of the dryer
cylinders and the guide device are so arranged that the first side of

the paper web is the upper side and the second side of the paper
web is the lower side.
