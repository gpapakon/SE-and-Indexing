<ABSTRACT>
An object (2) suitable for moving 
through a fluid is provided with a filament 

canister from which the filament (3) unwinds during movement, one end 
of the said filament being connected to a launching location (1), and the 

said filament has, at each location along its length, a tensile strength 
determined by combining the maximal value of the sum of the drag 

tensional load and of the standard tensional load acting on the filament 
at the said location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in the construction of 
flying objects controlled through an optical fiber communication link. Optical fibers are useful as communication links, in order to control 
flying objects. One example of such a controlled flying object is, e.g., an 
unmanned aircraft. The flying object normally contains an optical fiber 
canister, on which several kilometers of optical fiber are wound, which 
unwind during the flight of the object. The free end of the fiber is 
connected to the launching position of the object, so that physical 
connection exists and either mono- or bi-directional communication is 
possible through the fiber between the flying object and its launching 
position. Optical fibers are filaments made of optically pure glass processed so 
that they are capable of transmitting light therethrough with high 
efficiency, thus transmitting a large fraction of the light which is 
directed into the fiber even for long distances, such as many kilometers. 
Glass fibers are excellent for transmitting communication, and have 
the considerable advantage of being light in weight and small in 
diameter. The optical fiber is normally made of silicon dioxide and is 
coated with a so-called "buffer", which is a polymer layer which is 
provided to protect the optical fiber from scratches and other surface 
damages.  While reference is made throughout this specification to "flying 
objects", its is understood that the same considerations apply also, e.g., 
to objects moving through water, mutatis mutandis, and that the 
invention is also directed to objects capable of moving through any fluid, 
such as underwater remotely operated vehicles and the like. Reference 
to air as the representative fluid is made only for the sake of brevity. One basic problem which has to be dealt with is to provide a flying object 
incorporating an optical fiber which is constructed so as to withstand 
the tensional loads applied to it during flight, and to avoid breakage of 
the fiber which results in a substantial loss of the object due to loss of 
communication. It should be noted that the problem of providing a 
correctly dimensioned fiber is not a minor one. The preferred 
application is based on winding the bare fiber itself, e.g., a silica core, 
typically 125 microns in diameter, coated with a thin buffer layer, 
typically 20-70 microns thick. In this way the fiber core is used as both a 
lightguide and a strength member, and the tether cable weight, volume 
and cost are reduced to a
