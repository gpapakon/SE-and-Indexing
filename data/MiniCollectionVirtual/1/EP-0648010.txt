<ABSTRACT>
A differential amplifier comprises a Darlington differential pair (T₁/T₃, 
T₂/T₄) and a cross-coupled transistor pair (T₅, T₆) to increase the transconductance of 

the Darlington differential pair (T₁/T₃, T₂/T₄). The negative input impedance of the 
differential amplifier as a result of the presence of the cross-coupled differential pair 

(T₅, T₆) is compensated for at high frequencies and the gain of the differential amplifier 
is reduced by a compensation circuit with a capacitor (30) between the control 

electrodes of the transistors of the cross-coupled differential pair (T₅, T₆) and with 
resistors (26, 28) in series with the control electrodes of the transistors of the cross-coupled 

differential pair (T₅, T₆).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a differential amplifier for amplifying an input 
signal to an output signal, comprising: 
a first input terminal and a second input terminal for receiving the input 
signal, a first output terminal and a second output terminal for supplying the 
output signal, a first transistor and a second transistor, each having a first main 
electrode, a second main electrode and a control electrode, the control electrode of the 
first transistor being connected to the first input terminal and the control electrode of the 
second transistor being connected to the second input terminal; a third transistor and a fourth transistor, each having a first main 
electrode, a second main electrode and a control electrode, the control electrode of the 
third transistor being connected to the first main electrode of the first transistor and the 
control electrode of the fourth transistor being connected to the first main electrode of 
the second transistor; the first main electrode of the third transistor and the first main 
electrode of the fourth transistor being connected to a first node to receive a bias 
current, and the second main electrode of the third transistor being coupled to the first 
output terminal and the second main electrode of the fourth transistor being coupled to 
the second output terminal, a fifth transistor and a sixth transistor, each having a first main electrode, 
a second main electrode and a control electrode, the control electrode of the fifth 
transistor being connected to the first main electrode of the first transistor and the 
control electrode of the sixth transistor being connected to the first main electrode of the 
second transistor; the first main electrode of the fifth transistor and the first main 
electrode of the sixth transistor being connected to a second node to receive a bias 
current; the second main electrode of the fifth transistor being connected to the first 
main electrode of the second transistor and the second main electrode of the sixth 
transistor being connected to the first main electrode of the first transistor. Such a differential amplifier is known from Netherlands Patent 
Application no. 8602892, published on June 1st, 1988. Differential amplifiers of this 
type are also referred to as transconductors and are used inter alia in continuous-time 
balanced integrator filters for various purposes, such as video filters, equalizers etc. 
This requires differential amplifiers having a large gain-bandwidth product. Preferably, 
single-stage
