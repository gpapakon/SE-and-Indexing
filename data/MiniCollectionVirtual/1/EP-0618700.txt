<ABSTRACT>
A data synchronization device adapted to re-synchronize 
a multi-level digital signal (IN; OUT) with an 

output or local clock signal (CLKO). In case of a binary 
signal, the device includes two counter means (CA1-CC1, MAJ1, 

SEL1; CA0-CC0, MAJ0, SEL0) each associated to a logical level 
of the signal and counting the number of successive 1's or 

0's respectively. These counter means produce a count number 
including the number of counted bits and their level. The 

device further includes a decoder (DEC) generating in 
synchronism with the local clock signal (CLKO) a number of 

bits which is function of the count numbers. These generated 
bits constituting the requested output signal (OUT). 
The data synchronization device further includes 
delay means (DEL) for deriving from an input clock signal 

(CLKI) received with the input signal (IN), three 
intermediate clock signals (OA-OC) shifted in phase with 

respect to each other and each controlling one of a set of 
three counters (CA1-CC1; CA0-CC0) included in each of the 

counter means. The latter also each including a majority 
voting means (MAJ1; MAJ0) reading the numbers of bits counted 

by the three counters of the set, comparing these numbers and 
selecting a subset of at least two counters having counted a 

same number of bits. This number of bits is supposed to be 
correct and is therefore transferred to the decoder (DEC).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data 
synchronization device adapted to derive a multi-level 
digital output signal synchronized with an output clock 
signal from a multi-level digital input signal associated to 
an input clock signal having substantially the frequency of 
said output clock signal. Data synchronization devices are generally known in 
the art and are used for re-synchronizing a digital signal, 
e.g. electrical or optical data transmitted on a high speed 
link, with an output or local clock signal. Existing data 
synchronization devices use a number of sampling algorithms 
which essentially differ from one another in there capability 
to overcome the different timing problems caused by phase 
jitter, phase wander and possible frequency offset between 
the input and output clock signals. In many existing sampling 
algorithms two different general principles can be 
recognized: the device either samples the received digital 
data input signal on a multiple tap delay line and organizes 
a switch-over between data taps based on a correlation 
operation performed over all the taps, or supplies the 
received input clock signal through a multiple tap delay line 
and organizes a switch-over between clock taps based on the 
position of the sampling edge of the clock signal in the 
delay line. The many variants in the implementation of these 
two principles differ from one another in the way they solve 
the switch-over problem between data taps or clock taps and 
in the manner they perform the correlation operation or 
evaluate the position of the sampling edge of the clock 
signal in the delay line respectively. Both these two 
principles have advantages and drawbacks. For instance, in 
the case of data sampling the delay line must be relatively 
long to cover possibly long successions of identical logical 
levels, e.g. zeroes or ones of a binary digital input signal, 
whereas in the case of clock signal sampling frequency errors 
may be corrected but at the cost of the creation of a clock  
 
signal jitter. Anyway, in the known data synchronization 
devices every digit of either the received data or the 
received clock signal has to be sampled individually. As a 
consequence, a relatively large amount of hardware is needed 
and, since the sampling frequency is generally much higher 
than that of the input clock signal, one has to pay attention 
not to loose any digit during the above tap switch-over. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
data synchronization device which operates
