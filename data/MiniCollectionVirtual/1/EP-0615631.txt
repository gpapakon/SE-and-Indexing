<ABSTRACT>
A digital sound system for motion picture films employs a digital time code (20) on the film (4) to trigger the transfer of sound data from a digital audio store (40) to a FIFO memory (42). The digital audio data is read out from the FIFO memory and played back in the theater at a constant rate, with any jumps in the ditigal time code handled by making a corresponding jump within the digital audio store but not in the FIFO memory. Readout from the FIFO memory and clocking of the digital-to-analog converters (DACs) (DAC 1-4) used for theater playback is synchronized to the AC mains (54) that powers the theater projector, and thus allows for an uninterrupted audio playback even if time code entries on the film are obliterated. The FIFO memory need only have enough capacity to accomodate the maximum audio store access time, and can be quite small.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems and methods for producing 
an audio signal in response to a digital time code 
on a motion picture film. Current motion picture films employ analog sound recording 
techniques. Most motion pictures use an analog 
optical sound track that is printed onto the film along 
with the picture, and is optically scanned to reproduce the 
sound. Another technique is to record the sound onto magnetic 
strips that are coated along the edges of the film; 
this process is used for example in producing "DolbyÂ® 70mm 
Sound". Optical sound tracks have a number of shortcomings. 
They are suspectable to distortion caused in the laboratory 
printing process, have a limited frequency and amplitude 
range, and are subject to damage and noise caused by wear 
and dirt accumulation. Magnetically recorded sound tracks 
are subject to noise problems similar to those encountered 
with other audio tapes. It would be highly desirable to 
upgrade the quality of motion picture sound to a level comparable 
to that achieved with a compact disk, through the 
use of a digital sound system. Several attempts have been made to achieve a digital  
 
movie sound system. One approach has been to replace the 
analog sound track directly with a digital track by recording 
digital sound data in the area previously occupied by 
the analog track on the film. Although theoretically this 
approach could be used to yield a higher quality sound reproduction, 
it has proven difficult for film laboratories 
to reliably print the small bit size required to fit the 
amount of digital data needed in the restricted area available. 
There would also be a fairly low limit to the number 
of sound tracks that could be encoded onto the film. As a 
practical matter, this type of sound encoding is incompatible 
with the analog sound reproduction equipment available 
in most theaters, and would require the theater to have 
special dedicated sound equipment for the digital sound 
tracks. Any theater that wanted to run films with this 
type of digitally encoded sound track would thus have to 
have two separate sets of sound equipment, if they also 
wanted to be able to play films with conventional analog 
sound tracks. Conversely, the distribution of a film with 
such a digital sound track would be likely to suffer because 
it could not be run in a theater that had not added 
a digital sound capability. Another approach has been to print the digital information 
in "unused" areas of the motion picture print, such 
as between the film's

<CLAIMS>
A system for producing a sound signal, in 
response to a series of digital time code signals (20), 

from a digital audio store (40) that stores digital 
sound data corresponding to an expected sequence of said 

time code signals, comprising: 

a FIFO digital memory (42) having a data input 
and a data output, 
a digital data transfer controller (38) that 
responds to said digital time code signals by accessing 

the digital audio store and transmitting to the FIFO 
memory's data input the digital sound data that 

corresponds to said time code signals, said digital data 
transfer controller responding to a jump in the expected 

sequence of said time code signals by making a 
corresponding access jump in the digital audio store, 

without any jump being made in the digital sound data in 
the FIFO memory, and 
means (50) for reading digital sound data out 
from the FIFO memory at a rate that corresponds to the 

rate at which said digital time code signals are 
received, 
said digital audio store having an access time 
that is less than the data dwell time in said FIFO 

memory, and a data output rate capability that is 
greater than the rate at which digital sound data is 

read out from said FIFO memory. 
The system of Claim 1, including means for 
receiving a power input from an alternating current (AC) 

mains (54), wherein said means for reading digital sound 
data out from the FIFO memory includes a readout 

controller (50) and means (62, 64, 66, 72) for 
synchronizing said readout controller to the AC mains 

signal.  
 
The system of Claim 2, wherein said 
synchronizing means comprises a phase locked loop 

circuit (62) connected between the AC mains and said 
readout controller. 
The system of Claim 3, wherein said phase 
locked loop provides an output signal (64) which is 

synchronised with the AC mains signal. 
The system of Claim 1, wherein said digital 
data transfer controller includes a dynamic random 

access memory (RAM), and said FIFO digital memory is 
implemented in said RAM.

(34) for projecting visual images (8) from a movie film 

(4), and means (32, 36) for advancing a movie film past 
the projector, further comprising 


a sound signal producing system according to 
any of Claims 1-5, 
a time code reader (18, 24, 26) for reading 
a time code (20) on the movie film to generate said 

sequence of time.code signals and 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) means (DAC1, 
DAC2, DAC3, DAC4) for converting the digital sound data 

read out from the FIFO memory to an analog format; 
wherein the digital audio store (40) stores 
sound for the movie in a digital format that corresponds 

to the movie time code and the data dwell time in the 
FIFO memory is the film travel time from the time code 

reader to the projector. 
A method of providing an analog sound signal 
for a movie film (4) from a digital audio store (40) 

that stores the movie's sound, the film including a 
digital time code (20) and the digital audio store 

storing the sound in a digital format that corresponds 
to said time code, the method comprising the steps of  

 

advancing the film, 
reading the time code from the film as it 
advances, 
accessing the digital audio store to read out 
the digital sound data that correspond to the time code 

that has been read, 
loading the digital sound data that have been 
read out from the digital audio store into a digital 

memory (42), 
reading out all of the digital sound data that 
have been loaded into the digital memory a predetermined 

period of time after the corresponding time codes have 
been read from the film, at a rate that corresponds to 

the rate of film advancement, 
converting the digital sound data read out 
from said digital memory to an analog sound signal, and 
in response to a jump in the sequence of said 
time code, making a corresponding jump in accessing the 

digital audio store, without any jump in reading out the 
digital sound data from said digital memory. 
The method of Claim 7, wherein said film 
includes at least one unreadable time code, and in 

response to said unreadable time code the digital audio 
store is accessed to read out the digital sound data 

that corresponds to the next time code after the most 
recent digital sound data read out from the digital 

audio store.
