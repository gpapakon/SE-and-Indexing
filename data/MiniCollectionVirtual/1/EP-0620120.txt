<ABSTRACT>
Ink in an ink ribbon contains per 100 parts by weight 
of ink, 0.1 - 10 parts by weight of an adsorption-type 

corrosion suppressor. The adsorption-type corrosion 

suppressor may be one or more of, the following compounds: 
amines of the formula R-NHâ‚‚, RR'-NH, RR'R''-N (where R, R' 

and RR'' are alkyl groups), thiourea and its derivatives, 
benzotriazole and its derivatives, thiazole, thioamides and 

thiosemicarbazide. In another aspect of the invention, the 
ink contains an organic pigment as coloring material, said 

ink containing 5.0 - 10.0 parts by weight of graphite per 
100 parts by weight of ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns ink ribbons.In recent years, impact printers with cost advantages
which are capable of high speed printing are finding wide
application as man-machine interfaces, for example as
peripheral terminal units in data processing systems.Impact printers which print at high speeds constantly
have to deal with a large volume of data, and so it is
important that they have reliable print heads. It is
moreover highly desirable that print wires operate stably
over long periods without suffering corrosion or wear, and
without damaging the ink ribbon. These print wires may be
made of super-hard or other wear-resistant alloy or of
ferrous material which is easy to process and is inexpensive
(Patent Application Kokai Publication No. 59-79766).However, even these wires suffered from the major
drawback that when they were used over long periods, the
metal constituents of the wire were sometimes chemically
corroded.The corrosion of the wires however also depends on the
components of the ink in the ribbon.The black ink used in conventional ribbons may contain
carbon black as coloring material, as disclosed in Patent 
Application Publication No. 57-60956, and is in fact a
mixture of vegetable oil and mineral oil vehicles, carbon
black and oil-soluble dyes as coloring materials, and other
components such as dispersing agents.Carbon black normally contains 2 - 5 weight % ash as
impurities, together with sulfur oxides and chloride ions.
In the presence of moisture and oxygen in the atmosphere,
these impurities cause chemical corrosion of the metal
components of the print wire surface, and lead to serious
damage such as wire tip wear and wire breakage.In order to solve these problems, carbon black
containing no more than 1% of impurities was used, or the
impurities in the carbon black were eliminated in the
process of manufacture of the ink ribbon. Pure carbon black
is however very costly. Moreover, the elimination of
impurities during manufacture of the ink ribbon led to an
increase in the number of manufacturing steps, and so the
cost of manufacturing the ribbon was again increased.Another critical factor in high speed printing is that
the print head and other moving parts should be lightweight,
as is disclosed in for example the Technical Paper of the
Institute of Electronics and Communications Engineers of
Japan EPC84-2PP9. The print wires of super-hard alloy
mentioned above contain about 70 - 85 parts by weight of
tungsten carbide, and their density attains 13.5 - 14.5 
g/cm3. It is thus difficult to
