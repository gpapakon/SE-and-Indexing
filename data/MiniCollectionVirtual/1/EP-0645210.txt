<ABSTRACT>
A retort for use in diffusion bonding preselected areas of a 
stack of metallic sheets during a process of fabricating metallic 

sandwich structures. The retort facilitates a contamination-free, 
evacuated environment in which a plurality of sheets of 

titanium aluminide can be joined to one another at selected areas 
to form a pack. The process of joining embraces a technique of 

elevated temperature gas diffusion bonding. Subsequent 
superplastic expansion of the bonded blanks is employed to form 

desired sandwich structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the fabrication of 
structural units from titanium aluminide materials, and more 
particularly to a process and an apparatus for selectively 
joining titanium aluminide sheets to form a metallic structure 
which can then be superplastically expanded to form a sandwich 
structure of a desired shape. Titanium aluminide materials are well known in the 
metallurgical arts as materials which exhibit excellent 
high-temperature strength and oxidation and creep resistance.  
 Titanium aluminides, like other titanium alloys, are 
metals which are relatively brittle and difficult to process 
and/or fabricate at or near room temperatures. One fabrication 
technique which has found widespread utility in the fashioning of 
structures for various industries is diffusion bonding. Diffusion bonding refers to the metallurgical joining of 
surfaces of similar or dissimilar metals by applying heat and 
pressure for a time duration so as to cause co-mingling of atoms 
at the joint interface. The application of pressure accomplishes a plastic flow 
of the material to fill normal void areas. If the pressure is 
too low, small voids will remain at the joint interface and the 
joint strength will be less than the maximum attainable. The 
application of pressure also breaks up the surface oxides and 
surface asperities so as to present clean surfaces for bonding. The elevated temperatures used for diffusion bonding 
serve to accelerate diffusion of atoms at the joint interfaces as 
well as to provide a metal softening which aids in surface 
deformation thereby allowing more intimate contact for atom 
bonding and movement across the joint interface.  
 With practice of this technique, it has become accepted 
that diffusion bonding of titanium aluminide materials must be 
conducted in a controlled environment in order to ensure 
cleanliness of the materials which are particularly sensitive to 
oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor content in the air at elevated 
temperatures. Unless titanium aluminide is protected during this 
bonding process, it becomes embrittled and its integrity is destroyed. 
Further, attention is drawn to US-A-4 691 857 which shows a method and 
apparatus for diffusion bonding and shaping a workpiece in a single 
process and in a single apparatus. The apparatus consisting of an 
autoclave with an inner housing, having upper and lower portions. 
The upper and lower portions clamping the worpiece during diffusion 
bonding, with a peripheral skirt portion of the worpiece captured

<CLAIMS>
A system for carrying out gas diffusion bonding of preselected areas of a 
stack (40) of sheets of titanium aluminide material, comprising: 


a press comprising a pair of opposing press members (210,220), said press 
members defining a chamber ("V"); and 
an apparatus enclosing said stack (40) of sheets of titanium aluminide material, said 
apparatus being adapted to interact with one (210) of said pair of press members, said 

apparatus, comprising: 

an envelope (100) enclosing said stack, said envelope comprising upper 
and lower metal sheets (102,104) sealed together, with the interior being evacuated; 
a first frame member (120) disposed on one exterior surface of said 
envelope, said first frame member having a portion adapted for engagement with said one 

press member (210) and having a perimeter which encompasses the perimeter of said 
stack; 
a second frame member (110) disposed within said envelope and being 
arranged about the exterior of said stack; 
both of said frame members having a height greater than the height of said 
stack, 
said first frame member being moved into engagement with said press 
member in advance of carrying out said diffusion bonding process, 
such that when said portion of said first frame member engages said one press 
member (210), the volume between said one press member and said envelope atop said 

stack form a bonding chamber which can be heated to a diffusion bonding temperature 
and into which gas can be pumped to create a diffusion bonding pressure, 
said pressure and heat being maintained over a period of time sufficient to 
effect diffusion bonding, and 
said second frame member protecting edge portions of said stack from 
being crushed during said period of time. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said envelope includes means for 
protecting the edges of the sheets of said stack from being crushed 

during the process of gas pressure diffusion bonding, said protecting 
means being disposed about the perimeter of said stack, said frame member 

having a perimeter which encompasses said protecting means as well as 
said stack. 
The system of claim 2, wherein said means for protecting said 
stack edges includes slots extending therethrough and communicating a 

volume within said envelope in close proximity to one side of said 
protecting means adjacent said stack with a volume within said envelope 

in close proximity to the opposite side of said protecting means. 
The system of any of the preceding claims wherein said channel means 
includes a groove extending from a location adjacent said framing means 

toward said peripheral edge regions of said envelope, tubing means 
connecting the groove with the ambient, and protection sheet means for 

preventing the closing of the channel means during evacuation of said 
envelope portion located interior of said peripheral edge regions.  

 
A method for preventing the deformation of various regions of 
sheets of titanium aluminide material which have been arranged in a 

stack (40), while simultaneously diffusion bonding other preselected regions 
of a stack of sheets, said method comprising: 


locating said stack of titanium aluminide material sheets 
between upper and lower sheets (102,104) of metal to define an envelope (100) 

containing said stack, 
disposing a protective frame member (110) about the exterior of 
said stack of sheets within said envelope, said frame member 

having a height which exceeds the height of said stack, 
sealing said upper and lower sheets of said envelope to one 
another about the exterior of said frame member, such that 

the frame member is enclosed within said sealed envelope, 
applying a vacuum to the interior of said sealed envelope to provide 

a contamination-free environment in said 
envelope, and 
effecting diffusion bonding, whereby said various regions of said 
stack are prevented from being deformed by said frame member. 
The method of claim 5, wherein
 
   said step of applying a vacuum to the interior of said sealed envelope 

comprises providing means (150,106,112) for communicating the interior of 
said envelope with the ambient, and
 
   said step of providing a contamination-free environment in 

said envelope includes connecting vacuum-generating equipment to
