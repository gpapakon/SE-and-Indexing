<ABSTRACT>
Centrifugal separator comprising a rotor, which forms an inlet for the liquid which is to be centrifugally treated and an outlet chamber (17) for a liquid separated in the rotor, the outlet chamber (17) surrounding the rotational axis and being so designed that liquid present in the outlet chamber during operation rotates around the rotational axis and has a radially inward facing circular free liquid surface at a certain radial level in the rotor. A stationary discharge device (21) extends in the outlet chamber (17) from the said liquid body radially inward to a central outlet (25) and in the area of the free liquid surface it forms an inlet opening (23), which is directed toward the rotational direction of the liquid body and partly is located in the liquid body, the discharge device also forming a flow channel (28), which connects the inlet opening (23) to the central outlet. To obtain a high outlet pressure with minor risk of air admixture and a good stability the inlet opening (23) is delimited by an edge, which upstream has a front edge portion (33) radially inside the free liquid surface and downstream has a rear edge portion (31) radially outside the free liquid surface, a straight line (32) drawn through said edge portions (30, 31) forming an angle (V) with a tangent to the free liquid surface at the inlet opening (23), the angle being greater than 20  but smaller than 50  and the vertex of the angle being directed in the rotational direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a centrifugal separator 
comprising a rotor, which is rotatable around a rotational axis and 
forms an inlet for the liquid to be centrifugally treated and an 
outlet chamber for a liquid separated in the rotor, the outlet 
chamber surrounding the rotational axis and being so designed that 
liquid present in the outlet chamber during operation forms a 
rotating liquid body surrounding the rotational axis and having a 
radially inward facing free circular liquid surface. The centrifugal 
separator also comprises a stationary discharge device extending 
in the outlet chamber radially inward to a central outlet, and 
forming in the area of the free liquid surface an inlet opening 
directed towards the rotational direction of the liquid body and 
located partly in the liquid body, the discharge device also forming 
a flow channel connecting the inlet opening to the central outlet. A centrifugal separator of this kind is shown in WO-A-88102664. 
By the fact that the inlet opening of the outlet device 
in this centrifugal separator is only partly located radially outside 
the free liquid surface during operation, a liquid of a high viscosity 
can be separated in and discharged out of the centrifugal 
separator. However, the flow conditions in the flow channel near 
the inlet opening are such that a part of the liquid of high viscosity 
flowing into the flow channel turns and flows out again into the 
outlet chamber through the part of the inlet opening located  
 
radially inside the free liquid surface. This results in a low outlet 
pressure, a great risk of air admixture and an increased risk of 
instability. If the return flow of separated liquid passing from the 
flow channel out through the inlet opening and into the outlet 
chamber is reduced by diminishing the radius of the free liquid 
surface, a wave is created in front of the inlet opening and the 
energy consumption increases significantly, and the outlet pressure 
becomes low. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
centrifugal separator of the kind initially described, in which also 
a liquid of higher viscosity than 100 cSt can be separated and 
discharged out of the outlet chamber with a satisfactory outlet 
pressure and with low risk of air admixture and instability. A centrifugal separator according to the invention is 
characterised in that the inlet opening is delimited by an edge 
which, as seen in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the 
rotor, has an upstream front edge portion radially inside
