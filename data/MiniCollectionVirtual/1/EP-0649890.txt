<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat-curable coating system which contains no epoxide groups and is based on carboxyl-functional polyester resins and ss-hydroxyalkylamides and, if desired, further conventional additives, the coating system containing as binder resin (a) at least one saturated polyester having an acid number of 15 to 75 mg of KOH/g, an OH number of not more than 10 mg of KOH/g and a glass transition temperature of greater than 45 DEG C, which is composed of aliphatic diols and more than 80 mol% of isophthalic acid, and as crosslinking agent (b) at least one hydroxyalkylamide having at least two hydroxyalkyl groups. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of heat-curable coating systems which contain no epoxide groups and are based on carboxyl-functional polyester resins, in which components a), b) and, if desired, further conventional additives of the coating system according to claims 1 to 11 are mixed in the melt at from 80 to 130 DEG C, discharged, granulated, ground and then screened to a particle size of less than 90  mu m. The invention relates finally to the use of the coating system.
