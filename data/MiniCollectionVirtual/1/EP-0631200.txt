<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
automatic document conveying device adapted to an image 
processing machine such as an electrostatic copying 
machine or an image reader. It is now widely accepted practice to 
provide image processing machines such as electrostatic 
copying machines and image readers with an automatic 
document conveying device in order to automatically 
handle documents in the operations for copying images 
or reading images. Prior literatures that disclose 
automatic document conveying devices can be represented 
by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications Nos. 
91747/1978 and 118551/1985 and Japanese Utility Model 
Laid-Open Publication No. 49348/1986. The image processing machine such as the 
electrostatic copying machine or the image reader is 
equipped with a housing on which a transparent plate is 
disposed to place thereon documents that are to be 
processed. On one end edge of the transparent plate is 
mounted a document placing position restricting member 
against which the one end of the document is usually 
caused to be abut. The automatic document conveying 
device is comprised of a document table, a document 
introducing passage that extends from the document 
table to the one end edge of the transparent plate, a 
document receiving tray, and a document delivery 
passage that extends from the other end edge of the 
transparent plate to the document receiving tray. In 
the automatic document conveying device are further 
disposed document sending means that sends plural 
pieces of documents placed on the document table onto  
 
the document introduction passage piece by piece, 
document introducing means that introduces onto the 
transparent plate the document sent onto the document 
introduction passage, document conveying means for 
conveying the document along the transparent plate, and 
document delivery means that discharges the document 
onto the document receiving tray through the document 
conveying passage, the document being conveyed onto the 
document delivery passage by the document conveying 
means. Two document receiving trays are disposed in 
many cases, i.e., a first document receiving tray and a 
second document receiving tray. In these cases, the 
document delivery passage includes a common passage 
that extends from the other end edge of the transparent 
plate, a first branched passage that extends from the 
down stream end of the common passage to the first 
document receiving tray, and a second branched passage 
that extends from the downstream end of

delivery passage (132) into the first branched passage 
(138), then introduced into the re-introduction passage 

(134) and re-introduced onto the transparent plate (8), 
and thus, the top surface and the rear surface of the 

document are reversed and the document is again held at a 
required position on the transparent plate (8), and 

thereafter the branched passage switching means (142) are 
held at the second branching position, and the document on 

the transparent plate (8) is moved through the common 
passage (136) and the second branched passage (140) in the 

document delivering passage (136), and thus, the document 
is discharged onto the second document receiving tray 

(168) without reversing its top surface and its rear 
surface; 

and in that in the double reversing mode, the branched 
passage switching means (142) are held at the first 

branching position and the discharging re-introduction 
switching means (144) are held at the re-introduction 

position, and the document delivered to the transparent 
plate (8) from the document table (20) through the 

document introduction passage (40) is advanced into the 
first branched passage (138) from the common passage (136) 

in the document delivery passage (132), and then 
introduced into the re-introduction passage (134) and re-introduced 

 
onto the transparent plate (8), thus the top 

surface and rear surface of the document are reversed and 
the document is held at a required position on the 

transparent plate (8), and thereafter, the document is 
advanced again into the first branched passage (138) again 

from the common passage (136) in the document delivery 
passage (132), then introduced into the re-introduction 

passage (134) and re-introduced onto the transparent plate 
(8), whereby the top surface and the rear surface of the 

document are again reversed and the document is again held 
at a required position on the transparent plate (8), and 

thereafter the discharging re-introduction switching means 
(144) are held at the discharging position, and the 

document on the transparent plate (8) is moved through the 
common passage (136) and the first branched passage (138) 

in the document delivering passage (132), and thus the top 
surface and the rear surface of the documents are 

reversed, and the document is discharged onto the first 
document receiving tray (94). 
The device of claim 1, 
in which a movable frame member (70) is disposed movably 

between a closed position at which it covers the 
transparent plate (8) and an open position at which it 

reveals the transparent plate (8) to view, the document 
conveying means (74) are mounted on the movable frame 

member (70), and when the movable frame member (70) is 
held at the closed position, the document conveying means 

(74) can move the document along the transparent 
plate (8);
