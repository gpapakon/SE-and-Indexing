<DESCRIPTION>
 Azabl cycl o compounds as cal ci um channel antagoni stsThe present invention relates to novel azabicyclic derivatives, processes for their-*. preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy, in particular as calcium channel antagonists.German OLS 41 16582 describes azabicyclic compounds of the formula10wherein A, B and C independently represent -CH2- or a single bond; n is zero, 1 or 2; X is oxygen or sulphur and R is inter alia phenylalkyl. diphenylalkyl, heterocyclicalkyl, phenyl,15 diphenyl or a heterocycle, each of which may be optionally substituted. These compounds are said to be useful as muscarinic agonists.We have now found novel azabicyclic compounds, substitued at the bridgehead carbon atom, which have activity as calcium channel antagonists.20In a first aspect, the present invention provides, a compound of formula (I):25 Formula (I)in whichp, q and r each independently represent an integer from 1 to 4; 30 n is 0 to 6; m is 0 to 6; 

A is a bond, -CH=CH-, -C≡C-, oxygen, sulphur or NR1;R! is hydrogen, Cι_galkyl or phenylC^alkyl; andAr is aryl or heteroaryl, each of which may be optionally substituted;and salts thereof.p and r are preferably 2 or 3.q is preferably 1 or 2.The values of n, m and A should be chosen such that the length of the chain -(CH2)nA(CH2) is at least two atoms. In general the length of the chain -(CH2)nA(CH2)m is from 2 to 6 e.g. 2 to 5 atoms. Preferred values for n and m depend on the group A. Thus for example, when A is oxygen the sum of n+m is from 1 to 5, for example n may be zero, 1 or 2 and m may be zero or 1 to 5.A is preferably oxygen or a bond, most preferably oxygen.When Ar represents aryl, suitable groups include, for example, unsaturated monocyclic and unsaturated or partially saturated bicyclic or tricyclic ring systems of up to 15 carbon atoms, such as, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, fluorene, fluorenone, dibenzosuberene and dibenzosuberenone . Preferred are optionally substituted phenyl rings.An aryl group may be substituted, for example, by a C]__2alkylenedioxy group (e.g. phenyl substituted by a 3,4-methylenedioxy group) or by 1 to 3 substituents selected from halogen, C^alkoxy, nitro, SC^alkyl, NR2aR2b (in which R2a and R2b can be independently H or Cμ4alkyl), OCF3, C^galkyl, trifluoromethyl, CN, optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted phenoxy, optionally substituted phenylCι_4-alkyl and optionally substituted phenylCι_4alkoxy.Suitable optionally substituted phenylCι_4alkyl groups
