<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an assembly conveyor (30) with assembly workstations (31-36) which are opposite and parallel to one another and to which the assembly article (3) to be processed is delivered according to the assembly steps, these assembly workstations located parallel and opposite to one another being approached by two oppositely directed assembly tracks (2, 12) of the assembly conveyor (30), and a transfer of the assembly article (3) onto the respective oppositely directed assembly track (12) located opposite taking place at at least one end of the assembly conveyor (2), there being arranged at the outlet of the first assembly track (2) an approximately transversely movable lifting table which separates the assembly article (3) from the assembly track and which is provided with means converting a linear movement into a rotational movement.

<CLAIMS>
Assembly line with work-stations (31-36) situated parallel
opposite each other, to which the to-be-assembled object

(3) is delivered in accordance with the assembly sequence,
wherein two assembly tracks (2,12) of the assembly line

running in opposite directions travel along these work-stations
situated parallel opposite each other and at least

at one end of the assembly line a transfer of the to-be-assembled
object (3) is carried out to the opposite

situated assembly track which runs in the opposite
direction, characterised

in that on the runout platform of the first assembly track
a lifting table is provided which removes the to-be-assembled

object off the assembly track and can travel
approximately transversely, which table is provided with

means transforming a linear movement into a rotary one.
Assembly line according to claim 1, characterised in that
the lifting table has a carrier plate which is connected

with the transferring means via a crank lever.
Assembly line according to claim 2, characterised in

that the carrier plate is mounted on a shaft.
Assembly line according to claim 3, characterised in
that the crank lever on one of its ends is connected with

the shaft which penetrates through the carrier plate and at
the other end, at a distance from this shaft, with a guide

pin, which engages a control cam of a sliding block.
Assembly line according to claim 4, characterised in
that the lifting table is provided with linear guiding

means.
Assembly line according to claim 5, characterised in
that the working length of the control cam extends

approximately transversely to the assembly tracks along the
linear travel path of the lifting table. 
Assembly line according to claim 6, characterised in that
the control cam has a first linear extension range and a

first curved section which leads to a peak region and a
second curved sector from the peak region leading to a

second linear region.
Assembly line according to claim 7, characterised in that
the circular extension of the first curved sector is

positive and is 90°, whereas the circular extension of the
second curved sector is constructed negative and is also

90°.
Assembly line according to at least one of the claims 4 to
8,characterised in that the control sector of the

control cam is 180° over the working length.
Assembly line according to at least one of the claims 4 to
9, characterised in that the means of transfer of a

linear movement into a rotary one comprises the lifting
table with the linear guiding means which can be actuated

by an activating medium, the sliding block with the control
cam as well as the carrier plate with a shaft and a crank

lever with a guide pin.
Assembly line according to claim 10, characterised in
that the centreline of the shaft has a linear travel path.
Assembly line according to at least one of the claims 4 to
11, characterised in that the crank lever accommodates

the centreline of the shaft and the pivoting axis that of
the guide pin.
Assembly line according to claim 12, characterised in
that the guide pin and the shaft are provided in or on the

crank lever secured against relative rotation. 
Assembly line according to at least one of claims 4 to 13,
characterised in that the distance between the

pivoting axis and the centreline of the shaft is a fixed
constant.
Assembly line according to at least one of the claims 4 to
14, characterised in that the rotary movement of the shaft

is proportional relative to the travel path of the guide
pin in the control cam.
Assembly line according to claim 15, characterised in
that the lifting table has a lifting bellows which

activates the upward stroke supported by a scissors
mechanism.
Assembly line according to at least one the claims 10 to
15, characterised in that the lifting table has a carriage,

on which carriage the runners are provided, which form the
linear guiding means together with the rails provided on

the lifting table.
Assembly line according to claim 17, characterised in
that the carriage has a top plate which is penetrated

approximately in the centre by the shaft of the carrier
plate.
Assembly line according to claim 18, characterised in
that the top plate has a bearing block, inside of which the

shaft of the carrier plate is rotatably mounted.
Assembly line according to claim 19, characterised in that
in the bearing block ball bearings are provided.
Assembly line according to at least one of the claims 17 -
20, characterised in that the carriage is actively

connected with the actuating means for the linear movement.
