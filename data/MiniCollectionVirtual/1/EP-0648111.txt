<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to personal cleansing
products, especially cleansers and creams for bath or shower which
are formulated for mildness, viscosity control, phase stability,
and moisturization.Personal cleansing compositions are well known.The need for mild skin cleansing compositions is made more
acute by both the aging of the human population and the ever-increasing
environmental insult to which the skin is subject. The
mildest skin cleansing products can, at best, produce cleansing
without negatively affecting the skin condition. To achieve an
improvement in skin condition, the consumer is forced to use a
second, separate product often called a "moisturizer". The use of
two separate products to achieve the desired skin state is inconvenient
and often unpleasant due to the greasy skin feel resultant
from many moisturizers. As a result, many persons suffer from the
effects of poor skin condition rather than use two separate
products.There is a clear need for a single product which is capable
of delivering both mild skin cleansing and a skin conditioning
benefit. Many skin cleansing products contain humectant substances
which, although effective in topical application, are
ineffective in cleansing products. These humectants are ineffective
because they are very water soluble and suffer from poor
skin substantivity. Hydrophobic emollient materials are generally
more substantive to the skin, but are more difficult to incorporate
into an aqueous skin cleansing matrix. There are at least 
two sources of difficulty typically encountered: poor lather
effects and physically unstable product.US-A-3,829,563, Barry et al., issued August 13,
1974, discloses a liquid skin cleansing composition containing
petrolatum in the range of 10-70% having a diameter particle size
of (>95%) smaller than 5 microns.US-A-4,673,525, Small et al., issued June 16, 1987,
incorporated herein by reference, discloses mild surfactant based
personal cleansing systems, primarily synbars.Most non-solid soaps comprise mostly "soluble," "unsaturated,"
or shorter chains, e.g., lauric/oleic soaps for phase
stability. This, however, compromises lather quality and/or
mildness.The present invention allows for the incorporation of substantially
larger petrolatum particles than the prior art. These
larger particles result in greater functional efficacy than -
previously has been achieved.One object of this invention is to provide a personal cleansing
product which conditions and moisturizes the skin as the
product is used. Another
