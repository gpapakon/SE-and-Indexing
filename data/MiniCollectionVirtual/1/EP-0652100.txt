<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The tilt of the slide, caused by eccentric loading, on the mechanical presses is taken into account upon working-in of the die, the presses not being available from time to time for production tasks. Consequently, the dies are often worked in on a hydraulic work-in press. When using the dies on the production presses, time-consuming correction work is often still required as a result of the different load-dependent tilt of the slide. By virtue of the novel method, the tilting behaviour of production presses with different spring rates is intended to be simulated on a hydraulic work-in press. 2.2. The hydraulic work-in press contains at least four counter-retaining cylinders which act counter to the operating movement of the slide. In order to simulate the load-dependent tilt of the slide of mechanical presses, the oil pressure in the counter-retaining cylinders is regulated such that the slide is in each case counteracted at least in the operating region - starting from the tilt of the slide determined - by so much force that the tilts of the slide in the x-axis and y-axis are restricted to values which are given by parameterisable tilting characteristics Mx = f1 (kx) and My = f2 (ky).

Method of simulating the load-dependent ram tilting of 
mechanical presses on a hydraulic cavity press having at 

least one pressure cylinder connected to the press ram 
for developing a working pressure which acts upon the 

workpiece, having at least four holding-up cylinders 
acting upon the ram in the opposite direction to the 

working motion, having displacement measuring systems for 
detecting the ram position at any one time and having a 

control device for individual pressurization of the 
holding-up cylinders,
 
characterized in
 
that the oil pressure in the holding-up cylinders is 

controlled in such a way that at least in the working 
region - on the basis of the determined ram tilt - in 

each case sufficient force is opposed to the ram to limit 
the load-dependent ram tilts in the x- and y-axis to 

values which are preselected by means of parameterizable 
tilting characteristics

Method of simulating the load-dependent ram tilting 
according to claim 1,
 
characterized by the cyclic execution of the following 

steps in the working region of the press: 

1. detection of the pressure or the pressure difference 
and calculation of the effective piston force for 

each holding-up cylinder, 
2. detection of the distance between press bed and ram 
by means of displacement measuring systems at each 

ram corner and calculation of the ram tilts k

differences,  
 
3. determination of the setpoint holding-up moments for 
the x- and y-axis with the aid of preselected 

function characteristics and the actual ram tilts, 
4. determination of the setpoint forces for the 
holding-up cylinders by superimposition of the 

tilting moments while taking the geometric 
proportions of the press into account, 
5. comparison between setpoint and actual forces and 
input of the force differences into the force 

control units, 
6. influencing of the control valves by means of the 
actuating signals of the force control units in such 

a way that the pressures in the holding-up cylinders 
are varied until a conformance of setpoint and 

actual forces is achieved, 
 
it being possible within the cycle for steps to be 

executed either in parallel or in a different sequence.
