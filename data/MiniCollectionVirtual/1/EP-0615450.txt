water and additional adjuvants and additives to form a gel 

or a viscous solution, and Dimeticon is emulsified or 
suspended in the base composition thus obtained; 
b) the emulsion according to a) is cast into molds which 
are optionally stamped into powder trays by means of 

stamping boards; and 
c) dried at room temperature or elevated temperature. 
The process according to claim 9, characterized in that 
said pastilles are dried at a temperature in the range of 

from 40 to 70°C, particularly from 50 to 60°C. 
The process according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in 
that the dried pastilles are removed from the mold and 

optionally subjected to final treatment.
