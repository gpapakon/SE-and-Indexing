<ABSTRACT>
A wheeled support is described having a frame comprising four hollow arms (1) moulded from plastics material, arranged in the form of a cross. Each arm (1) carries an extension (2) slidably located in the hollow arm in a radial direction to adjust the length of the arm. Each arm (1) has a longitudinal slot (3) and carries a stop (4) at its outer free end with grooves (5) on its inner face to grip a container placed on the support. Located in a drilled hole (6) in the stop is a castor (7) having a rod (8) which locks in the hole by a spring circlip (9). A ratchet means (12) is provided between the extensions (2) and the arms (1) to incrementally adjust the extension means relative to the arms. The adjusted extensions (2) may be optionally locked relative to the arms (1) by screw-bolts (10) and wing-nuts (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A WHEELED SUPPORT This invention relates to a wheeled support and mor particularly to a wheeled support for containers.In medical or other clinical establishments wher materials have to be disposed of in a container it ha hitherto been the practice to walk to and from th container from the work location or to move the containe to the position at which the work is carried out. Howeve if the person is constantly moving from one work locatio to another the container has to be repeatedly moved t avoid unnecessary journeys to and from the container Another disadvantage arises where the person is require to wear sterile gloves and has to handle the container t move it from one work location to another. Th alternative was to slide it across the floor with th person's foot. There is also a requirement for use o such wheeled supports in domestic or industria applications.An aim of the present invention is to overcom the above problem and disadvantages and provide a wheele support to carry existing containers having a wide variet of outside shapes and sizes and to make them readil 

 transportable.According to the present invention there i provided a wheeled support comprising a frame having a least three radial arms with a wheel at or near the end o each arm wherein the arms are radially adjustable b ratchet means to receive and support the base of container.Preferably, the frame has four radial arms each arm having an extension slideable relative to th arm and locked thereto, the free end of the extensio carrying a wheel or caster.Conveniently, the wheeled support frame is mad of a rigid plastics material.The extensions are preferably adjustabl connected to the radial arms by ratchet means on the radial arms which engage ratchet pawls formed in the extensions to increment the movement of the extensions relative to the radial arms.The extensions are preferably locked relative to the radial arms by a screw-threaded wing-nut and a bolt passing through a slot in the radial arm and/or extension. In one preferred construction the frame is made from two members connected at their mid-points by a wing- nut and bolt. An embodiment of the wheeled support according to the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Figure 1 is a perspective view of a wheeled support, andFigure 2 is a fragmentary detail of a support arm and extension, andFigure 3 is a modified construction of the wheeled support. The wheeled support comprises four hollow arms 1 which are

CLAIMS:
1. A wheeled support comprising a frame having a least three radial arms with a wheel at or near the end o each arm, wherein the arms are radially adjustable b ratchet means to receive and support the base of container.
2. A wheeled support as claimed in Claim 1, wherei the frame has four radial arms,' each arm having a extension slideable relative to the arm and locke thereto, the free end of the extension carrying a whee or caster.
3. A wheeled support as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein the frame is made of a rigid plastics material.
4. A wheeled support as claimed in any precedin claim, wherein the extensions are adjustable relative t the radial arms by ratchet means on the radial arms whic engage ratchet pawls formed in the extensions to incremen the movement of the extensions relative to the radia arms. 5. A wheeled support as claimed in any precedin claim, wherein the extensions are locked relative to th radial arms by a screw-threaded wing-nut and a bol passing through a slot in the radial arm and/or extension. 6. A wheeled support as claimed in any precedin claim, wherein the frame is made from two member connected at their mid-point by a wing-nut and bolt.
