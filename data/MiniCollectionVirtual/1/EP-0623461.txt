<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tubular element for 
use in a heat-exchanger for example for use in a radiator, 
car-heater, intercooler or the like in an automobile. Aluminum heat-exchangers are known for the 
above-mentioned uses which comprise tubular elements which 
allow a heat-exchanging medium to flow therethrough. These 
heat-exchangers require a high-corrosion resistance and good 
mechanical strength in order to provide an adequate lifetime 
which is typically considered to be around 10 years. It is 
known to employ a controlled atmosphere braze (CAB) furnace 
process to manufacture such heat-exchangers from the tubular 
elements of the alloy "AA3003" which is relatively corrosion 
resistant and the composition of which is specified by the 
Aluminum Association. The "AA3003" alloy is used for the 
tube, header and sidewall of the exchangers and 
modifications to the "AA3003" alloy composition have been 
made in order to achieve both corrosion resistance and 
strength. However, the brazing process carried out on 
"AA3003" tubular elements can cause secondary effects such 
as silicon diffusion and fin erosion which has limited the 
performance of such tubular elements in the pressure and 
thermal cycles and in corrosive tests for production 
validation. In addition, the heat-exchange medium which is employed 
in heat-exchangers is generally water which may include 
impurities mixed with engine coolants and atmospheric 
contaminants. These provoke corrosion susceptibility of the 
heat-exchanger tubular elements during normal use. The 
tubular elements of known heat-exchangers comprise an inner 
clad layer which has a sacrificial character, that is a 
nobler corrosion potential than the core of the tubular 
element and an outer clad layer, which is a brazing layer, 
for securing fin members to the tubular elements. The inner 
clad layer is intended to protect the heat-exchanger tube  
 
and other components against corrosion. The core material 
is also required to exhibit good resistance to silicon 
penetration by diffusion, the diffusion being dependent upon 
the brazing time, the brazing temperature and the silicon 
content in the brazing layer. US 4991647 discloses a heat-exchanger comprising 
tubular- elements made of a first aluminum alloy and fin 
members of a second aluminum alloy. The first aluminum 
alloy comprises 0.05 to 1.0wt% of Mg, 0.2 to 1.2wt% of Si, 
0.2 to 1.5 wt% of Mn, 0.01 to 0.5wt% of Fe and the balance 
aluminum. The second aluminum alloy comprises 0.05 to 
1.0wt% of Mg,
