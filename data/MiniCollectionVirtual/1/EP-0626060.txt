<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to shot pellets for hunting wild game, particularly birds on wet marshlands. The pellets are also suitable for clay pigeon shooting on organized skeet ranges. The shot pellets have an inner core comprised of lead or lead alloy, and an outer layer of silver or silver alloy. The shot pellets are not influenced, or only slightly influenced by a strong hydrochloric acid environment, therewith greatly eliminating the risk of lead leaching from the pellets. The shot pellets are produced by coating shot pellet cores of lead or lead alloy electrochemically with at least one layer, wherein the outermost layer is always comprised of silver or a silver alloy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to shot such as BB-shot 
pellets, for wild game hunting and particularly for 
hunting birds on wet marshlands and for clay pigeon 
shooting from organized skeet ranges, wherein the shot pellets 
comprises an inner core of lead or lead alloy and an 
electrochemically deposited outer layer of a metal. 
Large numbers of lead shot pellets are used worldwide 
when hunting wild game, particularly when hunting 
birds. The majority of the pellets fail to hit the 
target, and fall relatively undamaged to the ground or 
settle on the bottom of waterways and lakes. With 
time, more and more lead pellets accumulate on the 
ground and on the bottoms of lakes and rivers. Investigations have shown that over the last decennium 
sea birds in particular have shown signs of lead 
poisoning. It has been established that the birds 
ingest lead pellets from the ground or from the bottom 
of rivers and lakes in their search for food and also 
for gravel to assist in digestion of the food ingested. The lead pellets remain in the gizzard of the bird for 
from 7 to 15 calendar days. The gastric juices produced 
by birds are relatively acid and have a pH of 
about 1 and contains mainly hydrochloric acid, and 
consequently large quantities of lead are leached from 
the pellets. The leached lead then travels through the 
blood vessels to vital body organs and causes suffering 
and, in many cases, the death of the animal or 
bird concerned. According to scientific research, the 
ability of such creatures to reproduce is also affected 
by the ingestion of lead. The risk increases in 
areas that are densely populated by sea birds, where 
hunting is highly intensive.  
 Progressively more countries forbid the use of lead 
shot for hunting birds on wet marsh lands, lakes, 
rivers and other waterways, so as to avoid subjecting 
the birds to lead poisoning. The use of lead shot 
pellets over land is also prohibited, so as to avoid 
lead leaching from lead pellets in natural habitats. 
The use of lead shot pellets on clay pigeon skeet 
ranges is quantitatively much greater than the use to 
hunt birds on wet marshlands etc. This results in an 
undesirable local accumulation of lead, and the use of 
lead shot for clay pigeon shooting thus constitutes an 
environmental problem. At present time, the alternative to lead shot is iron 
or steel shot. Bi-shot is available, although only in 
very limited quantities. Steel and iron shot, however, 
are encumbered with other serious drawbacks and hunters 
have reacted

electrochemically deposited outer layer 

of a metal, characterized in that 
said metal layer is silver or a silver alloy.

Claim 1 and 2 by applying at least one 

layer of metal electrochemically to shot pellet cores made of 
lead or lead alloy, characterized in that the outermost layer is 

always comprised of silver or silver alloy. 
A method according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 in 
that the shot pellet cores are comprised of conventional 

lead shot pellets. 
A method according to Claims 3-4, 
characterized
 by 
pre-treating the shot pellet cores with or without 

intermediate layers by cleaning and activating the 
cores. 
A method according to Claims 3-5, 
characterized
 by 
after-treatment in the form of controlled heating, 

resulting in a denser and more durable layer. 
A method according to Claims 3-6, 
characterized
 in 
that at least one layer has an adhesive effect on 

inwardly and outwardly lying layers and material 
respectively.  

 
A method according to Claims 3-7, 
characterized
