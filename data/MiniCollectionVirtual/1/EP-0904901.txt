<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable positioning target assembly for
use in a positioning device includes a target member (7)

that is secured in a desired position in an internally
threaded bore (1) between a pair of set screws (5,6).

The internally threaded bore (1) is provided in body of a
positioning device. Proximity sensors which respond to

the target member are coupled to an element of the
positioning device. The body and element of the

positioning device are movable with respect to one
another. The target member (7) and set screws (5,6) can

include through-holes which allow the target member (7)
and set screws (5,6) to be adjustably positioned in the

internally threaded bore (1) by a driver tool.
The adjustable positioning target assembly can be used in

cooperation with gripper jaws or other positioning
devices

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to workpiece holders
having moveable jaw members. More particularly the
present invention relates to workpiece and part grippers
having moveable jaws and proximity sensors which are used
to determine the position of the movable jaw members.
The present invention further relates to adjustable
positioning target assemblies which can be used in
conjunction with a variety of positioning devices.There are a variety of jaw designs for workpiece and
parts grippers including those with sliding jaw members.
Such sliding jaw members are typically positioned in
channels that are formed in the base or body of a gripper
assembly. The jaws are reciprocally driven back and
forth in the channels by fluid actuators or other
mechanical means. Such jaw designs are used in gripper
assemblies which include two opposable jaws or multiple 
jaws which are capable of converging on a workpiece or
part to be gripped.An example of a gripping apparatus which includes
two slidable opposing jaw members is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,768,821 and exemplified by the "SHURGRIP"
gripper which is available from Phd, Inc., Fort Wayne,
Indiana. The SHURGRIP gripping apparatus can be provided
with optional proximity sensors which sense the position
of the gripper jaws. The proximity sensors include
switches which are triggered by target structures that
are attached to the gripper jaws. The target structures
trip switches of the proximity sensors. The tripping of
the switches indicates the position of the target
structure and hence the position of the jaws.Because different workpieces and parts may require
that the jaws of a gripper be positioned at different
locations for closing and opening, proximity sensors
designed for the SHURGRIP gripper and other slidable.
gripping assemblies are adjustably positionable. That
is, the position of the proximity sensors are adjustable
along the axis of travel of the targets.The present invention is directed to adjustable
target assemblies which can be incorporated into slidable
jaw members and used in devices such as the SHURGRIP and
other devices which include at least one or more slidable
gripper jaws. The present invention is further directed
to adjustable positioning target assemblies which can be
used in conjunction with a variety of positioning devices
other than mechanical grippers. According to various features, characteristics and
embodiments of the present invention which will become
apparent as the description thereof proceeds, the present
invention provides an
