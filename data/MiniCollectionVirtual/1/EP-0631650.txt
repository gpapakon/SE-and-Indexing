<ABSTRACT>
Liquid ring pumps have an annular clearance substantially filled with compressed gas between a stationary housing and a rotating liner inside the housing. The compressed gas provides a gas bearing which supports the liner for rotation relative to the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid ring pumps for pumping 
gases or vapors (hereinafter generically "gas") to 
compress the gas or to produce a reduced gas pressure 
region ("vacuum"). More particularly, the invention 
relates to liquid ring pumps having a liner inside the 
stationary pump housing, said liner being free to rotate 
with the liquid ring to thereby reduce fluid friction 
between liquid ring and the housing. DE - A - 3 115 577 is concerned with introducing air 
between a liquid ring and a liner containing the liquid 
ring and does not address the problem of reducing drag in 
a bearing for a rotary liner. Liquid ring pumps with rotating liners are known as 
shown, for example, by Haavik US - A - 5,100,300 and SU - 
A - 939,826. In US - A - patent 5,100,300 the liner is 
supported for rotation by a pressurized bearing liquid in 
the clearance between the liner and the stationary 
housing. In SU - A - 939,826 gas is mixed with the 
liquid which supports the liner for rotation to reduce 
frictional resistance to rotation of the liner. Liquid, 
or even liquid mixed with gas, still exerts considerable 
drag force on the liner. It is therefore an object of this invention to reduce the 
drag on the rotating liners in liquid ring pumps having 
such liners.  
 This and other objects of the invention are 
accomplished in accordance with the principles of the 
invention by providing a liquid ring pump according 
to Claim 1. Further features of the invention, its nature 
and various advantages will be more apparent from the 
accompanying drawings and the following detailed 
description of the preferred embodiments. FIG. 1 is a simplified sectional view of an 
illustrative liquid ring pump constructed in accordance 
with the principles of this invention. FIG. 2 is a simplified sectional view taken 
along the line 2-2 in FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is another view similar to FIG. 2 
showing an illustrative modification in accordance with 
this invention. FIG. 4 is a simplified sectional view of 
another illustrative liquid ring pump constructed in 
accordance with the principles of this invention. FIG. 5 is an enlargement of a portion of 
FIG. 4 showing a possible modification in accordance 
with this invention. FIG. 6 is a view similar to a portion of 
FIG. 5 showing another possible modification in 
accordance with this invention. As shown in FIG. 1 (which drawing is similar 
in some respects to the right-hand portion of FIG. 1 in  
 
U.S. - A - 5,217,352), an illustrative pump 10 
constructed in accordance with this
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A liquid ring pump (10,100) having an annular 
housing (20, 122), an annular liner member (34,170) 

disposed in said housing and spaced from the interior 
surface of said housing by an annular clearance (35,173), 

and a rotor (28,140) disposed in said housing for 
rotation about an axis about which said liner member is 

annular so that rotation of said rotor causes said rotor 
to form a quantity of pumping liquid that is maintained 

in said housing into a recirculating annular liquid ring 
inside said liner member, and means 

(33,36,38,122d,122c,122e) for introducing pressurized gas 
into said clearance, characterised in that the clearance 

is substantially free of liquid and said pressurized gas 
substantially fills said clearance to form a 

substantially liquid-free gas bearing on which said liner 
member rotates relative to said housing, the gas forming 

the bearing being separated from the pumping liquid by 
the liner member which is interposed between the 

pressurized gas bearing and the pumping liquid. 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 1 
further characterized by an end member (176) on each 

axial end of said liner member, each of said end 
members extending radially inwardly from said liner 

member. 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 2 
further characterized in that each of said end members 

(176) extends radially inwardly from said liner member 
approximately at least as far as said liquid ring 

extends radially inwardly from said liner member. 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 3 
further characterized in that each of said end members 

(176) is toroidal.  
 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 2 
further characterized in that each of said end members 

(176) is axially spaced from an adjacent axial end 
portion of said housing by a second clearance (175) 

into which pressurized gas is introduced to 
substantially fill said second clearance and thereby 

provide a further gas bearing between said end member 
and said housing. 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 1 
further characterized in that said means for 

introducing pressurized gas into said clearance 
comprises a plurality of apertures (38, 122e) through 

the interior surface of said housing, said apertures 
being spaced from one another in the annular direction 

around said housing, a portion of said pressurized gas 
being introduced into said clearance via each of said 

apertures. 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 1 
further characterized by sealing means (177) for 

substantially preventing said pressurized gas from 
escaping from said clearance into said liquid ring or 

the working space of the pump which is inside said 
liquid ring. 
The liquid ring pump defined in claim 1 
wherein said axis is substantially horizontal, and 

wherein said rotor and liquid ring cooperate to pump 
gas from a relatively low intake pressure adjacent a 

first arcuate segment (SUCTION ZONE) of said liquid 
ring to a relatively high discharge pressure adjacent a 

second arcuate segment (COMPRESSION ZONE, DISCHARGE  
 

ZONE) of said liquid ring, further characterized in 

that said pump is oriented so that said second arcuate 
segment is adjacent the top of the pump.
