<ABSTRACT>
An extension set 10 for use with an intravenous catheter 
placement unit comprising a cannula protruding from a hub, 

and an introducer needle protruding from a flash chamber 
fitted with a flash plug, with the needle extending through 

the cannula so that the flash chamber abuts the hub is 
provided. The extension set comprises a flexible conduit 

12; first connecting means 50 at a first end 16 of the 
conduit for connecting the conduit to the cannula hub of 

the catheter placement unit; and second connecting means 22 
at a second end 14 of the conduit for connecting the 

conduit to a fluid feed line of an intravenous fluid 
administration set. An injection port 34 for injecting a 

treatment substance into the conduit, is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to intravenous catheterization. 
More specifically the invention relates to an extension set 
for use with an intravenous catheter placement unit. According to the invention, there is provided an extension 
set for use with an intravenous catheter placement unit 
comprising a cannula protruding from a hub, and an 
introducer needle protruding from a flash chamber fitted 
with a flash plug, with the needle extending through the 
cannula so that the flash chamber abuts the hub, the 
extension set comprising
 
   a flexible conduit;
 
   first connecting means at a first end of the conduit 
for connecting the conduit to the cannula hub of the 
catheter placement unit;
 
   second connecting means at a second end of the conduit 
for connecting the conduit to a fluid feed line of an 
intravenous fluid administration set; and
 
   an injection port for injecting a treatment substance 
into the conduit.  The injection port may be located at the second end of the 
conduit, and may be combined with the second connecting 
means in an injection port/second connecting means 
combination. The injection port/second connecting means combination may 
comprise a tubular member attached to the second end of the 
conduit with the free end of the tubular member being 
connectable to the fluid feed line; a cylindrical 
component, for receiving a component of a syringe, 
protruding transversely from the tubular member, with its 
inside being in communication with the inside of the 
tubular member so that it provides the injection port; and 
sealing means inside the tubular member capable of 
permitting passage of fluid from the cylindrical component 
to the tubular member while preventing passage of fluid 
from the tubular member to the cylindrical component. The 
sealing means may be in the form of a sleeve of resilient 
material around the inside of the tubular member, with the 
sleeve being capable of deforming sufficiently to permit 
ingress of fluid from the cylindrical component to the 
tubular member. The tubular member may be provided, at its free end, with 
outwardly protruding connecting means for connection 
thereto of a suitable connector on the fluid feed line. 
The connecting means may be lugs, a flange or the like.  The first connecting means may be a screw-threaded 
connector. It may be of more-or-less universal form, being 
connectable to the hub of different catheter placement 
units. It may, for example, be a so-called LUER LOCK 
(trade mark). The invention will now be described by

intravenous fluid administration set; and 

   an injection port for injecting a treatment substance 
into the conduit. 
An extension set according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the injection port is located at the 

second end of the conduit, and is combined with the second 
connecting means in an injection port/second connecting 

means combination. 
An extension set according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the injection port/second connecting 

 
means combination comprises a tubular member attached to 

the second end of the conduit with the free end of the 
tubular member being connectable to the fluid feed line; a 

cylindrical component, for receiving a component of a 
syringe, protruding transversely from the tubular member, 

with its inside being in communication with the inside of 
the tubular member so that it provides the injection port;

permitting fluid passage of fluid from the cylindrical 

component into the tubular member while preventing passage 
of fluid from the tubular member to the cylindrical 

component. 
An extension set according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the sealing means is in the form of 

a sleeve of resilient material around the inside of the 
tubular member, with the sleeve being capable of deforming 

sufficiently to permit ingress of fluid from the 
cylindrical component to the tubular member.
