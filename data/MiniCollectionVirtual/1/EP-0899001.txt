<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle arrangement used in a scrubbing tower to uniformly scrub a contaminated gas stream comprises nozzles connected to branch lines (5) with intermediate pieces (6), the nozzle distribution being determined by the length and position of the intermediate pieces (6).   Nozzle arrangement comprises nozzles connected to branch lines (5) with intermediate pieces (6), the nozzle distribution being determined by the length and position of the intermediate pieces (6). Flux density profiles (FD3, FD3') are established for the spray cone (3) of the nozzles (1) in prescribed cross-sectional planes of the adsorption zone. For each cross-sectional plane (Q1, Q2...) the flux density profiles (FD3, FD3') are overlapped. Flux density distributions (FDV1, FDV2, ...) established for the cross-sectional planes (Q1, Q2..) are projected onto one plane and are overlapped to a flux density total profile (FDGP) characterizing the scrubbing liquid distribution of the adsorption zone. The flux density total profile is compared to a prescribed value. On deviations from the prescribed value the position of one or more nozzles is changed and the previous steps repeated until the flux density total profile (FDGP), established for the scrubbing tower cross-section, up to a wall region of the tower has a constant value.

A method of installing a nozzle arrangement consisting
of distributors (4), branch lines (5) and nozzles (1) in a

scrubbing tower, which comprises a scrubbing liquid sump,
an absorption zone without internal baffles and at least

one nozzle level above the absorption zone, whereby the
nozzles (1) are connected to the branch lines (5) with

adaptor pieces (6) which branch off at the side, and
whereby


a) flow density profiles (FD3, FD3') are created for
the spray cones (3) of the nozzles (1) in

predetermined cross-sectional levels of the
absorption zone;
b) for each cross-sectional level (Q
1
, Q
2
, ...), the
flow density profiles (FD3, FD3') assigned to the

spray cones (3) are superimposed;
c) the flow density distributions (FDV1, FDV2, ...)
created for the cross-sectional level (Q
1
, Q
2
, ...)
are projected onto a plane and are superimposed to

yield an overall flow density profile (FDGP) which
is characteristic of the washing fluid distribution

of the absorption zone;
d) the overall flow density profile is compared with a
setpoint value, and 
e) if there are any deviations from the setpoint
value, the position of one or more nozzles (1) is

altered by changing the length or position of the
respective adaptor pieces (6), and steps a) through

d) are repeated until the overall flow density
profile (FDGP) created for the scrubbing tower

cross section has an approximately constant value
up to an area near the wall of the scrubbing tower.
The method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the distributor (4) is arranged in an axis of symmetry (7)
of the scrubbing tower cross section, and the nozzles (1)

are arranged in mirror image around the axis of symmetry
(7) in an identical distribution on both sides of the

distributor (4).
The method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 hollow-cone nozzles or solid-cone nozzles which spray
downward are used as the nozzles (1).
