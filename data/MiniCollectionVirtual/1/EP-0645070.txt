A sound reproduction apparatus comprising stereophonic 
amplifier means (3) on the basis of two signals (6
1
, 6
2
), namely a left signal 
and a right signal, coming from any stereophonic emission source (1) and a 

plurality of loudspeakers (4, 9) disposed in two groups relative to a listening 
direction, namely a left group (9) and a right group (4), the groups 

respectively receiving the amplified left signal (8) and the amplified right 
signal (7), the apparatus being characterized in that the set of said 

loudspeakers (4, 9) is even in number, and equal to not less than four, all of 
the emission faces of said loudspeakers (4, 9) being placed in a surface (5) 

of continuous curvature, and in that said loudspeakers are situated in pairs 
on vertical or substantially vertical axes (zz'), and the respective distances 

vertically and horizontally between said loudspeakers (4, 9) are determined 
as a function of the dimensions thereof and of the dimensions of the 

listening volume, and each loudspeaker (4, 9) is associated with its own 
amplifier (10) which applies to said loudspeaker all of the signal frequencies 

received, said signals being previously subdivided into as many paths (12) 
as there are loudspeakers by means of a distributor (2). 
The sound reproduction apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that it includes a modulator (11) which, for each of the left 

and right channels, and after integration at least of the signal (6) 
corresponding to said channel and coming from the emission source (1), 

serves firstly to distribute it over each of the path outputs (12) of the 
distributor (2) corresponding to the loudspeakers in the same channel, as a 

function of pre-established thresholds for opening one or more of said 
outputs (12), and secondly modulates the amplification of each of the 

signals addressed thereto as a function of said signal, while ensuring that 
the phase and the frequencies thereof remain unchanged. 
The sound reproduction apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that it includes a modulator (11) which, after integrating the 

overall signal (6
1
, 6
2
) received from the emission source (1) firstly 
distributes said signal over each of the path outputs (12) of the distributor 

(2) as a function of pre-established thresholds to open one or more of said 
outputs (12) and secondly modulates the amplification of each of the signals  

 
addressed thereto in accordance with said overall signal, while ensuring 

that the phase and the frequency thereof remain unchanged. 
The sound reproduction apparatus according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it includes six loudspeakers, comprising 

two left side speakers (9), two right side speakers (4) respectively receiving 
the left signal (8) and the right signal (7) corresponding thereto, and two 

central speakers situated at equal distances (
d
) from the two side groups, 
and receiving both the left signal and the right signal. 
The sound reproduction apparatus according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it comprises eight loudspeakers 

disposed in two groups of four, giving four left speakers (9) and four right 
speakers (4) each forming a quadripole, the speakers being placed 

symmetrically about a midplane (xx'). 
The sound reproduction apparatus according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said loudspeakers are all identical and 

are selected to have a frequency response range lying between about 100 
Hz and about 10
4
 Hz.
