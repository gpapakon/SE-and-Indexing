<ABSTRACT>
A slider inserting apparatus (1) is constructed such 
that before a concealed fastener chain (C) is threaded 

through a slider (S), the front and back and the rear end of 
a flange portion (S-1) and the front surface and the fore-end 

of a guide post (S-2) are held between a pair of upper 
and lower slider holders (11, 12) with a locking pawl (S-4) 

held in a releasing position. With the insertion of the 
fastener chain, the front surface of the flange portion 

(S-1) is freed from engagement with the lower holder (12) 
to enable passage of the fastener chain (C) through the 

slider (S). The slider (S) is still held from three different 
directions by the holders (11, 12) so that in spite of a 

unique or odd shape of the slider (S), the fastener chain 
(C) can smoothly be threaded through the slider (S). The 

slider inserting apparatus (1) is preferably combined 
with a chain-reversing apparatus (3) having element-reversing 

grooves (31b, 32b), in which instance the top stop 
applying process and the slider inserting process can be 

carried out continuously on one and the same processing 
machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
inserting sliders successively into a concealed slide fastener
chain fed continuously, and also to a concealed
slide-fastener finishing machine for applying top end stops
to the fastener chain simultaneously with the insertion of
the slider by the slider inserting apparatus.Although the slider inserting apparatus used exclusively
for sliders for concealed slide fasteners are known, they
are, less in number than those used for sliders for general
slide fasteners due to their structural complexity induced
by the unique shape and configuration of the slider and
fastener chain such as shown here in FIGS. 7 and 8. Particularly,
as regards automatic slider inserting apparatus
of the so-called "forward insertion" type in which a concealed
fastener chain is threaded in an engaged or coupled
condition into the mouth of a slider and withdrawn from
the opposite wider mouth of the slider in a disengaged or
separated condition, it is rare to see a prior proposal
other than one disclosed in EP-A-0 147 771. The slider inserting apparatus disclosed in this
Japanese publication includes a pull guide having a pull
groove for receiving therein a pull of the slider. The pull
guide is movable from a lower side of a fastener chain to an
upper side through the gap between two fastener tapes at an
element-free space portion, so as to receive the pull of the
slider which has already been held by a pair of slider
holders on the upper side of the fastener chain, with the
pull suspended vertically downwardly. The pull guide and
the slider holders are attached to a common frame so that
when the pull guide is lowered, the slider holders concurrently
move downwards, thus enabling the pull to move
through the fastener chain from the other side to the one
side without interference with the fastener tapes.After passing through the slider inserting apparatus,
the fastener chain moves into a top stop applying
station in which the folded inner longitudinal edge portions
of the fastener tapes each carrying thereon a row of coupling
elements are unfolded by reversing them by a spreading
plate, and while keeping this unfolded condition of the tape
edges, top end stops are attached to the respective fastener
tape by fusing that part of the coupling elements located
adjacent to one end of the element-free portion, in such a
manner as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-33364. 
The fastener chain is then cut into individual
product lengths to produce finished concealed slide

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for inserting a slider (D) for a concealed
slide fastener, comprising:


an upper slider holder (11) having a contact surface (11a)
for closely contacting with the back and the rear end of a

flange portion (S-1) of the slider (S), and a lower slider
holder (12) disposed directly below said upper slider holder

(11) and having a contact surface (12a-1) for closely contacting
with at least the front surface and the foreend of a guide

post (S-2) of the slider (S) to support thereon the guide
post (S-2), said lower slider holder (12) being vertically

movable when the slider (S) is inserted into a fastener
chain (C);
said lower slider holder (12) including a first holder
portion (12a) disposed forwardly of a pull chamber (A) which

is adapted for receiving therein a pull (S-3) of the slider
(S); and
said first holder portion (12a) having a contact
surface (12a-1) for closely contacting with the front surface

and the fore-end of the guide post (S-2) for supporting the
guide post (S-2), and an unlocking surface (12a-2) for closely

contacting with a locking pawl (S-4) of the slider (S) to
release the locking pawl (S-4) from interlocking engagement

with coupling elements of the fastener chain (C) when said
contact surface (12a-1) of said first holder portion (12a)

and the front surface and the fore-end of the guide post
(S-2) closely contact with each other, 
characterized in that
said lower slider holder (12) additionally comprises a
second holder portion (12b), disposed rearwardly of said

pull chamber (A),
said second holder portion (12b) having a contact surface
(12b-1) for closely contacting with the front surface of

the flange portion (S-1) for supporting the flange portion
(S-1), and said second holder portion (12b) being movable

independently with respect to,
and in a direction away from,

said first holder portion
