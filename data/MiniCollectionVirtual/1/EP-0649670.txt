<ABSTRACT>
A multi-station exercise machine has a movable subframe on which a user sits 
while performing various exercises. The subframe is pivotally attached to a stationery 

frame and is supported by a lever arm that is also pivotally attached to the stationery 
frame. The pivot arms coupling the subframe to the stationery frame bear against a 

carriage that is movable located on the lever arm. A cable and pulley system couples 
the lever arm to the various operable members of the apparatus so that a selectable 

ratio of the weight of the subframe, including the user, is communicated as exercise 
resistance. The amount of weight that is coupled to the operable members is selected 

by positioning the carriage along the lever arm. This adjustment also varies the height 
to which the subframe is lifted by the exercise stroke and hence the effort that must be 

exerted by the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of exercise equipment, and particularly to an 
exercise machine in which at least a substantial portion of the exercise resistance is 
provided by the body weight of the operator. A wide variety of exercise machines have been developed for exercising 
various muscle groups of the body. Most such machines employ weights to provide 
resistance to the operator's exercise movements. Most commonly, a stack of 
individual weight plates is provided in an arrangement such that a selected number of 
the weight plates may be coupled to the exercise station by a cable, lever mechanism 
or other device. Exercise machines of this type typically have a weight stack with a 
total weight of 200 to 300 pounds. Such weights represent a significant fraction of the 
cost of an exercise machine, especially when transportation costs are considered. 
Moreover, conventional weight plates are noisy when the exercise machine is in use. The use of a person's own body weight as a source of exercise resistance is, of 
course, well known. For example, many calisthenic exercises, such as push-ups, sit-ups 
and the like, employ body weight as a source of exercise resistance. Several 
types of exercise apparatus that use body weight resistance have been commercially 
introduced. For example, the HealthRider® is a device for simultaneously exercising 
muscle groups of the upper and lower body in which the operator is alternately raised 
and lowered on a seat by operation of the apparatus. The Total Gym®, marketed by 
EFI/Total Gym, employs an inclined sled to support the operator. Various exercises 
available with this machine cause the sled to be pulled up the incline as the operator 
exercises. The Body Force™, marketed by Maximus, provides a selectable amount of  
 
assistance to an operator while performing body weight exercises such as dips and 
chin-ups. The Gravity Edge™ has a pivoted platform on which the operator is 
supported in either a sitting or standing position. The platform is coupled by linkage to 
an exercise arm such that operation of the exercise arm causes the platform to be 
lifted. Other variations of body weight exercise machines are shown in U.S. Patent 
Numbers 4,632,390 and 4,949,958, both issued to Richey. These patents disclose 
devices in which an operator is supported on a generally horizontal bench which is 
lifted by various exercises. A roller and lever arm arrangement provides adjustment 
for the amount of body weight that is communicated as exercise resistance. The
