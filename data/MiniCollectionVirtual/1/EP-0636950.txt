<ABSTRACT>
A developing apparatus includes a developer 
carrying member (3) for carrying a magnetic developer (7), the 

developer carrying member (3) is provided with a plurality 
of magnetic poles (4a-4d); a regulating member (5) for regulating 

a layer thickness of the developer (7) on aid developer 
carrying member (3); an elastic rotatable member (6), disposed 

upstream of a developer regulating position of the 
regulating member (5) with respect to a movement direction (b) 

of the developer carrying member (3), for supplying the 
magnetic developer (7) onto the developer carrying member (3); 

wherein a surface of the elastic rotatable member (6) is 
of unicellular foamed material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing
apparatus of an electrophotographic or electrostatic
recording type or the like such as a copying machine,
a printer, a facsimile machine or the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a
copying machine, a printer, a facsimile machine or the
like, a latent image is formed on an image bearing
member comprising an electrophotographic
photosensitive member and an electrostatic recording
member or the like, and the latent image is visualized
into a toner image by development operation of a
developing device. As an example of such a developing
apparatus, various dry type developing apparatus for
use with one component developer, have been proposed
and put into practice. However, it is very difficult
to form a thin layer of one component developer on a
developer carrying member. In view of the recent
demand for sharpness and high resolution of images, a
method and an apparatus for forming the thin layer of
the toner capable of forming better thin layer are
particularly desired. In response, various measures
have been proposed. For example, it has been proposed to form a
thin layer of the toner supplied with proper
triboelectric charge is formed on a developing sleeve
having a smooth surface with relatively smooth pits
and projections provided by blasting with regular
particles, by the use of a magnetic blade disposed
with a gap therefrom, for a magnetic one component
toner.When the toner of smaller particle size and
having low melting point, is used for the purpose of
higher image quality and quicker start of the copy
operation, the blocking tends to occur adjacent thc
magnetic blade because such toner is more easily
agglomerated as compared with the conventional toner.
For this reason, under a high humidity condition, the
formed images may involve non-uniformity or fog; and
under a low humidity condition, the toner are
agglomerated and deposited locally on the developing
sleeve due to electric charge-up of the toner, with
the result of blotch, which may appear on the
resultant image, in some cases. As a countermeasure,
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 16736/1985
or the like proposes that an elastic blade of rubber,
resin material or metal is lightly contacted to the
developing sleeve, and the toner agglomerated and
deposited on the developing sleeve is removed by the
contact area (so-called elastic blade system), so that 
a uniform thin layer of the toner is formed. In
addition, the top part and bottom part of the toner
layer on the developing
