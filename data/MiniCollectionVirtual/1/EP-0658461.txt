<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatically operated window wiper drive for rail vehicles with a working piston (2) which can be moved forwards and backwards, a control piston (3) for reversing the compressed air feed and venting the working piston (2) and a compressed air-activated locking piston (4) for blocking the control piston (3) so that the wiper arm (10) to be driven and its wiper blade (11) are held in a parked position. In order to avoid damage to the wiper arm (10) and to the wiper blade (11) from the washing brushes of a washing system when the respective rail vehicle is travelling through the said washing system, two locking pistons (5, 6) are provided for blocking the working piston (2) in an intermediate position which ensures a vertical position of the wiper arm (10) and of the wiper blade (11) and two valves (31, 32) are provided for venting the compressed air inlet (17) for the working piston (2) and the control piston (3), and for venting the compressed air inlet (23) for the locking piston (4) of the control piston (3), the two locking pistons (5, 6) of the working piston (2) and the two valves (31, 32) being capable of being activated together.

Pneumatic windscreen wiper drive for railway 
vehicles with 


a) a working piston (2), which is movable forwards 
and backwards between two end positions and is 

fixable in one of the end positions, 
b) a control piston (3) which is movable forwards and 
backwards between two end positions by means of 

the compressed air acting on the working 
piston (2) for reversing the admission of 

compressed air and the ventilation of the working 
piston (2) on reaching one or other of the end 

positions, and 
c) a first pneumatically actuatable stop piston (4) 
for blocking the control piston (3) in one of its 

end positions and thus fixing the working 
piston (2) in whichever end position it was moved 

to at this control piston end position, 
 
characterised by 


d) two further stop pistons (5, 6) for blocking the 
working piston (2) in an intermediate position, to 

which a vertical position of the washer arm (10) 
and the washer blade (11) corresponds, and 
e) two valves (31, 32) for ventilating the compressed 
air inlet (17) for the working piston (2) and the 

control piston (3) on the one hand, and the 
compressed air inlet (23) for the first stop 

piston (4) of the control piston (3) on the other  
 

hand respectively, 
f) the two further stop pistons (5, 6) of the working 
piston ((2) and the two valves (31, 32) being 

actuatable together. 
Windscreen wiper drive according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the two further stop 

pistons (5, 6) of the working piston (2) are arranged 
coaxially to the same in front of the one and the other 

end of the same respectively. 
Windscreen wiper drive according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the two valves (31, 32) are 

connected via respective inlet lines (33 and 34) to an 
operating valve (28) and via outlet lines (35 and 36) 

to the relevant compressed air inlet (17, 23) and are 
switchable between two positions, in which the 

respective inlet line (33, 34) and the respective 
outlet line (35, 36) communicate with each other or the 

respective inlet line (33, 34) is blocked and the 
respective outlet line (35, 36) communicates with the 

open air. 
Windscreen wiper drive according to claim 1, 2 
or 3, characterised in that the two further stop 

pistons (5, 6) of the working piston (2) and the two 
valves (31, 32) are actuatable by means of compressed 

air and can be acted upon by compressed air via a 
common electromagnetically actuatable valve (37). 
Windscreen wiper drive according to one of the 
previous claims, characterised in that the common 

actuation of the two further stop pistons (5, 6) of the 
working piston (2) and of the two valves (31, 32) can 

be set in train by means of a wash travel switch.  
 
Windscreen wiper drive according to claim 5 in 
connection with claim 4, characterised in that the 

electromagnetically actuatable valve (37) is 
electrically connected to the wash travel switch.
