<ABSTRACT>
Crude estramustin phosphate containing a tertiary 
amine may be purified by dissolving crude estramustin 

phosphate in a fatty acid ester, adding 
both
 methanol or 
ethanol 
and
 water under acidic conditions to precipitate 
purified estramustin phosphate, and recovering the 

precipitate. By this method, the tertiary amine liable to 
be present in the final product can be effectively removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for purification 
of crude estramustin phosphate or a salt thereof. 
This estramustin phosphate is a common name of estradiol-3-N-bis(β-chloroethyl)-carbamate-17β-dihydrogen 
phosphate 
represented by the following formula, and is known to be 
chemotherapeutically extremely useful as an antitumor 
agent. 
As described in U.K. Patent No. 1,016,959, 
estramustin phosphate is prepared by reacting estradiol-17-dihydrogen 
phosphate with N-chloroformyl-bis(β-chloroethyl)amine 
in the presence of a tertiary amine. However, 
when the desired compound is isolated and purified 
from the tertiary amine-containing reaction mixture 
formed by the reaction, it is known that by recrystallization 
using methanol, ethanol, acetone or the like as 
described in the above patent, it is extremely hard to 
avoid mixing of the tertiary amine, particularly pyridine 
into the product. Thus, as a method for removing from purified 
estramustin starting the above reaction mixture pyridine 
which is mixing thereinto, a method is proposed in GB 
1,523,035 which comprises forming, first, a molecule-like 
complex is formed from an alkanol having at least three 
carbon atoms and estramustin phosphate; dissolving the 
resultant complex in a solvent other than the alcohol  
 
used for the complex formation, for example methanol, 
ethanol or acetonitrile; and recovering the purified 
desired compound from the solution. Although it is 
possible to obtain purified estramustin phosphate not 
containing pyridine or the like according to this proposed 
method, there is a tendency that the yield lowers 
due to the interposition of the molecule-like complex 
formation step. The object of this invention lies in 
providing a method for purification of estramustin phosphate 
which is more efficient than the usual methods and 
can give estramustin phosphate highly pure enough to be 
usable as a medicinal bulk. The present inventors found that a purified 
product derived from a precipitate obtained by simply 
dissolving crude estramustin phosphate in a fatty acid 
ester without forming a molecule-like complex with an 
alkanol, and adding both methanol or ethanol and water in 
an acidic condition does not contain not only the tertiary 
amine such as pyridine, but the starting materials 
nor by-products mixing into the above reaction mixture. Thus, the above object can be attained by this 
invention, namely by a method for purification of crude 
estramustin phosphate which comprises 
(A) a step to dissolve the crude
