<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a multilayer molded article comprising a skin 
material laminated on the surface of a foamed thermoplastic resin 

comprising;
 

   placing a skin material between an unclosed pair of female and male 
molds;

 
   supplying a molten resin composition obtained by melt kneading a 

foaming agent with a glass fiber-containing thermoplastic resin which 
contains 3 - 40 % by weight of glass fiber and has bending modulus of 

elasticity of 20,000 kg/cm² or more at a room temperature between the 
said skin material and one of the female and male molds;

 
   closing the molds to fill the molten resin composition in a cavity 

formed by both the female and male molds;
 

   opening both the molds and foaming the molten resin composition by 
reducing pressure; and

 
   cooling to solidify it.

 
A light weight, little deformation multilayer molded article comprising 

a skin material laminated on a surface of a foamed thermoplastic resin 
can be produced in a high cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing a multilayer molded
article comprising a foamed thermoplastic resin and laminated thereon a
skin material and to the thus-produced multilayer molded article, which
can be used for automobile interior parts and home electric products.Multilayer molded articles laminated with a skin material on their surface
are widely used in various fields, for example, as automobile interior
parts and home electric products in view of their good shaping property
and low production costs.To meet the strong demand for lightning of these multilayer molded
articles, there has recently been proposed that a skin material is
laminated on the surface of a foamed resin base.JP-A-No.4-148907 discloses a process for producing
such multilayer molded articles, comprising the steps of:
placing a skin material between an unclosed pair of female and male
molds; supplying a molten thermoplastic resin composition kneaded with a
foaming agent between said skin material and one of the female and male
molds; closing the said pair of molds; opening them and foaming a molten resin composition under reduced
pressure; and cooling to solidify it.By this process, light multilayer molded articles with good appearance
can be produced in a high molding cycle and low cost. However, it has 
a problem that deformation of the molded article occurs depending upon
the shapes of the multilayer molded articles, particularly bending
angles at bended parts of products become outwardly wider than the
designed value. This problems can effectively be prevented by, for
example, increasing the thickness of the resin bases or sufficiently
cooling the multilayer molded articles under adequate pressure in the
molds, but these methods cause another problem that the weight of the
articles increases, and a molding cycle becomes long or that softness of
the skin materials is damaged.EP-A- 0 544 501 discloses a process for preparing composite foamed
molded articles.It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which,
without causing undesired deformation of molded articles, enables the
production of a light weight multilayer molded article at a high molding
cycle and low cost.This object was achieved on the basis of the finding that the above
mentioned purpose can be attained when a glass fiber containing thermoplastic resin composition with a
bending modulus of elasticity of 20,000 kg/cm2 or more at room temperature and containing 3-40 % by weight
of glass fiber is used.Thus, the present invention
