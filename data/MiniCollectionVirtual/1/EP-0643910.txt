<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an implement for 
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a 

milking robot with a robot arm (1) able to carry teat cups 
(24) and a cleaning member (33, 54, 66) for cleaning the 

teats of the animal. The cleaning member (33, 54, 66) is able 
to be coupled to or uncoupled from the robot arm (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such an implement is known from EP-A-0323444.In the said implement the teat cups and the cleaning
member are fixed to a hinge pin which is mounted on the
robot arm. In order to milk the animal or clean the teats,
the teat cups and the cleaning member are able to rotate
through 180Â° around the hinge pin. The use of a robot arm on
which the cleaning member and the teat cups are permanently
fixed, has the drawback that during milking of the animal the
cleaning member remains fixed to the robot arm and thus forms
an obstacle which occupies space.The present invention aims at providing an implement
such as is described in the opening paragraph, which
obviates the drawbacks mentioned or at least limits them to a
considerable extent.For this purpose the implement as meant in the
opening paragraph, in accordance with the invention, is
characterized by the features of the characterizing part of
claim 1. With the aid of a robot arm according to the invention
it is possible to take both the cleaning member and the
teat cups under the animal to be milked, while, when the
teats are cleaned, the cleaning member can be uncoupled from
the robot arm so that the cleaning member forms no obstacle
for the robot arm when the teat cups are applied to the teats
of the animal to be milked. According to a feature of the invention, hereto the support
can be provided with projections, preferably teat-shaped
projections, which by applying a vacuum to the
teat cups are drawn into the teat cups, so enabling the
support to be secured by suction in a fixed position in
relation to the teat cup duster.According to another aspect of the invention, the
cleaning member is provided with cleaning tools and
there are provided cleaning means for decontaminating
the cleaning tools. Before the teats of another animal
are cleaned with the cleaning tools, it is thus possible to
decontaminate the cleaning tools, so minimizing the risk
of cross infections.According to an aspect of the invention, the cleaning
tool/tools and/or cleaning member are able to be
taken to a cleaning plant by the robot arm which is used
for attaching the teat cups or by a separate robot arm.According to a feature of the invention, the cleaning
plant comprises a container in which a cleaning or rinsing
liquid can be provided. A second container is
arranged in the first container and, according to a further
feature of the invention, is provided with perforations.
According to a further feature,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An implement for automatically milking animals,
comprising a milking robot equipped with a robot arm (1)

able to carry teat cups (24), the implement further
comprising a cleaning member (33, 54, 66) for cleaning the

teats of the animal, 
characterized in that

member (33, 54, 66) is capable of being motor-driven, is

provided with at least one cleaning tool (40, 63, 67) and is provided
on or near the extremity of a support (32) to be placed

under the dairy animal, said support (32) being suitable
for being placed on or near the end of the robot arm (1) and

being able to be coupled
to or uncoupled from the robot arm (1) automatically by

means of the teat cups (24) and vacuum therein.

charac-terized
in that
 the support (32) is provided with teat-shaped
projections (34).
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 1, 2,

characterized in that
 the support (32) can be
attached to a second robot arm (26).

claims, 
characterized in that
 the cleaning member
(33, 54, 66) is provided with deaning tools (40,

63,67) and there are provided cleaning means (69)
for decontaminating the cleaning tools (40, 63, 67).
An implement as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the cleaning tool/tools (40, 63, 67) and/or
cleaning member (33, 54, 66) are able to be taken

to a cleaning plant by the robot arm (1) which is
used for att
aching the teat cups (24), or by the second
robot arm (26).
An implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the cleaning tools
(33, 54, 66) are fully or partly constituted by or have
