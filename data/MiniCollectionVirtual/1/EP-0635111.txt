<ABSTRACT>
A relining pipe for insertion inside sewer lines to repair them. The relining pipe is made up of a number of substantially rigid pipe elements (1), which are interconnected by pipe couplings, such pipe coupling comprising a female sleeve part (2) and a male locking part (3), at least one of these having a circumferential shoulder surface and the other having a stop surface pressing against the shoulder surface when the pipe elements are pressed against each other, and the female part and the male part counterparts (5, 16) which snap-lock to each other in order to prevent the pipe elements from becoming detached from each other. The pipe element (1) has, as an extension of the male part (3) towards the female part (2), a shoulder ring (6) which is integral with the element and the outer diameter (D3) of which is approximately the same as the outer diameter (D2) of the female part. This shoulder ring has a shoulder surface (7) against which the stop surface of the outer edge of the female part (2) presses when the pipes are pressed together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a relining pipe of the type defined in the first part of claim 1.
Documents US-A-4 796 and WO-A-89/03956 disclose such pipes.Many, for example, buried pipelines, such as sewer lines, and
among these in particular concrete sewer pipes, deteriorate
gradually, and for various reasons also other damage may appear
in them, such as cracks, ruptures, and the like. At some stage
the pipelines in use must be repaired. This can, of course, in
the case of sewer lines be done by digging them up and by replacing
them with new pipes. However, the excavation and
filling work is expensive and time-consuming, and additionally
the excavations cause disturbance to traffic, for example in
cities. For this reason, damaged pipelines are now being repaired
by means of so-called relining pipes which are, for
example, plastic pipes which are inserted from the end of the
pipeline section to be repaired into the original pipe, whereby
the original pipe is lined inside.There are several types of such relining pipes. One possibility
is to use flexible, for example corrugated, plastic piping, the
parts of which are interconnected by welding above ground and 
the pipe is inserted in a continuous form, for example, through
a manhole, into the pipeline section to be repaired. Such
piping is inexpensive, but it can be used only in relatively
small diameters, since a large-diameter pipe cannot flex in the
small space of a manhole. In addition, in such a pipe structure
it is difficult to arrange a branching system which could be
implemented without opening the intersection area.Another possibility is to use pipe elements the length of which
is at maximum the diameter of a manhole, in which case the pipe
elements can be inserted one at a time to extend a pipe element
or a row of pipe elements already in the sewer line section,
and this relining pipe made up of pipe elements is inserted
always one element length at a time into the sewer line section
being repaired. One possibility for forming such pipe elements
is to cast or otherwise form tubular pieces having female
sleeves at both ends. In addition, in this embodiment male pipe
lengths are used the length of which corresponds to the length
of two successively placed sleeve parts. In this case, the
outermost ends of the female parts will settle against each
other and the pipe length inside them will keep the ends of the
elements in place. This relining pipe is thicker at the female
parts than elsewhere. However, this structure has the disadvantage
that

<CLAIMS>
A relining pipe for insertion inside sewer lines and similar pipelines in
order to repair them, the relining pipe being made up of a number of

substantially rigid pipe elements (1) which are interconnected by pipe
couplings, such a coupling comprising a female sleeve part (2) and a

male locking part (3); the bottom of the female part and the outer end
of the male part have counterparts (5, 16) which snap-lock to each

other in order to prevent the pipe elements from being detached from
each other under tension, a stop surface (8) formed by the outer edge

of the female part pressing against a shoulder surface (7) formed by

the male part when the pipes are pressed together, thereby forming a
first support surface pair, the bottom of the female part (2) being a

shoulder (17b) pressing against the stop surface (15c) formed by the
outer edge of the male part (3) when the pipes are pressed together,

thereby forming a second support surface pair, characterized by the
following features:


1.1 the outer diameter (D2) of the female sleeve part (2) is greater
than the outer diameter (D1) of the pipe part, and the shoulder

surface (17b) thereof is transverse to the length of the pipe
element;
1.2 the pipe element (1) has, as an extension of the male locking
part (3), a shoulder ring (6) which is integral with the element;
1.3 the outer diameter (D3) of the shoulder ring (6) is approximately
the same as the outer diameter (D2) of the female part, and the

shoulder surface (7) thereof is transverse to the pipe length (L);
1.4 the pipe element (1) has, as an extension of the female part (2)
towards the locking part (1) a limiting ring (9) integral with the

element; 
1.5 between the limiting ring (9) and the female part is a groove (10)
for a locking chuck;
1.6 said surfaces of each support surface pairs (15c and 17b; 7 and
8) have a counter-surface area;
1.7 the shoulder ring (6) is located in each element at a point
towards the female part (2) from the male part (3);

male locking part;
1.9 the surface (13) of the limiting ring (6) is facing away of the
female part (2);
1.10 the said surfaces (12, 13) are beveled in such a manner that
each of the surfaces (12, 13) forms an angle (K1 and K2) to the

outer surface (14) of the pipe part in order to ensure the push
movability of the relining pipe in a sewer.
A relining pipe according to claim 1, characterized in that the outer
edge of the locking part (3) has a locking ring (5) provided with an

outwardly beveled surface (15a) and a surface (15b) facing the pipe
part (4) and transverse to the pipe length (L), and the lower portion of

the female part (2) has a locking groove (16) having a greater diameter

groove having in its outer edge a transverse stop surface (17a) for
providing the said snap-locking, that the bottom of the locking groove
