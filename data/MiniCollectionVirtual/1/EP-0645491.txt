<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing paper from integral 
vegetable substances with low alpha-cellulose content, in 

particular biomasses of various origins and residual 
wastes coming from farm processes and the farm-foods 

industry, comprising the steps of drying and reducing said 
substances to minute particles, before adding them to the 

cellulose-fibre mix, which is used for making paper in 
paper-machines.. Also the present invention relates to 

paper obtained from the above-described process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a process for 
manufacturing paper using integral vegetable substances 
with a high content of alpha-cellulose. The following 
description refers especially to paper, though the process 
described is equally useful for the manufacture of 
cardboard which is therefore included as part of this 
invention. In the present text, the expression "integral 
vegetable substance" is understood to mean a substance of 
vegetable origin having an alpha-cellulose content of 
normally less than 15% in weight with respect to its 
weight in the natural state and a water content of less 
than 20% in weight. As, in paper-making technology, those 
substances different to cellulose are commonly called 
filler, another possible name for the integral 
vegetable substances in the invention is organic 
filler. In the long history of paper-making, the use of 
vegetable fillers other than cellulose has been studied at 
various times, but the vegetable substances effectively 
used were always chosen from the fibre types, 
especially from those with a high cellulose content. The 
main non-cellulose and non-fibre vegetable substances 
used on a large scale in paper making were starches, 
especially for operations of treating the surface of 
already-manufactured paper (size-press and coating). Recently, the Applicant described in the European 
Patent Application N.93104829 a paper-manufacturing 
process which foresees the use of integral seaweed. Continuing research on the potential use of natural and 
vegetable substances, particularly the low-cost waste  
 
materials deriving from other manufacturing processes, for 
paper manufacturing, the Applicant has now found it 
possible to utilise advantageously integral vegetable 
substances in paper making, and especially the low-cost 
waste materials from other manufacturing process, in 
part or total substitution of mineral fillers normally 
used in paper and also in substitution of part of the 
cellulose itself. According to the invention, the paper has a main 
characteristic of containing from 1% to 50% in weight (on 
dry basis) of integral-form vegetable substances, 
preferably from 10% to 40% in weight (on dry basis). Particularly useful in paper-making were those 
vegetable substances consisting of farm-waste or 
residuals, such as integral straw, integral corn, corn-cobs, 
bran from wheat or other cereals, husks of rice and 
other cereals, vegetable skins, peels and residuals of 
citrus fruits, the residuals from sugar-cane 
processing, the residuals

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing paper from integral 
vegetable substances characterised by the fact that: 


a) vegetable substances having a alpha-cellulose content 
of less than 15% in weight are dried at a temperature 

lower than 150°C reducing their water-content to a 
value of less than 20% in weight; 
b) these dried substances are micronized to reduced 
particle sizes of between 0.1 to 500 µm; 
c) these micronized substances, in powder or in water 
suspensions, possibly mixed with agglomerative 

substances, are added to the paper-making cellulose 
mix in quantities of from 1 to 50% in weight of the 

mix. 
Process as per claim 1. characterised by the fact 
that these vegetable substances are micronized in water 

in order to obtain suspensions with a content from 1% 
to 70% of dry substance and these suspensions are 

pasteurized or irradiated to prevent fermentation. 
Process as per claim 1. characterized by the fact 
these dried substances are micronized in order to reduce 

particle dimensions to between 1 to 100 µm. 
Process as per claim 1. characterised by the fact 
that said agglomerative substances are selected from 

the group consisting of salts of aluminium, salts of 
iron, cationic starch, cationizing agents. 
Paper containing from 1 to 50% in weight of integral 
vegetable substances having a alpha-cellulose content of 

less than 15% in weight. 
Paper as per claim 5. characterised by the fact 
that said integral vegetable substances come from the 

treatment of biomasses of agricultural, farm and food 
origin. 
Paper as per claim 6. characterised by the fact 
that said biomasses are made up of the processing 

residuals of citrus fruits, the tubers of starches, 
 

corn, wheat, rice, cereals, oil-seeds. 
Paper as per claim 6. characterised by the fact 
that said biomasses are made up of integral straw, 

integral kenaf, millet, annual plants, lucerne. 
Use of paper containing from 1 to 50% in weight of 
integral vegetable substances having a alpha-cellulose 

content of less than 15% for the production of livestock 
feed.
