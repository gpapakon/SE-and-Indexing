<ABSTRACT>
A lighting or signalling device for a motor vehicle, comprising a base (10) carrying a lamp which emits a light beam outwards, a glass (lens) closing a front opening of the base, an intermediate screen (20) which can be engaged in the base via its front opening and means (11, 12, 21) for holding the intermediate screen in the base. According to the invention, the said holding means comprise, on the one hand, means (11, 12) which form rear stops and are provided inside the base, on which at least one edge of the intermediate screen is supported and, on the other hand, a retention tab (21) located towards the front of the intermediate screen, which extends towards the front opening of the said base from one edge of the screen and interacts by elastic snap-fastening with an arrangement inside the said base.

Lighting or signalling device for a motor vehicle comprising a base (10) carrying
a lamp which emits a light beam to the outside, a glass closing a front opening of

the base (10), an intermediate screen (20) able to be engaged in the base through
its front opening and means (11, 12, 21) of holding the intermediate screen (20) in

the base (10), characterised in that the said holding means comprise on the one
hand means forming rear stops (11, 12) provided inside the base (10) and on which

at least one edge of the intermediate screen (20) comes into abutment, and on the
other hand a retaining lug (21) towards the front of the intermediate screen (20)

which extends towards the front opening of the said base (10) from an edge of the
screen and which cooperates by elastic snapping-in with an internal arrangement on

the said base (10).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said lug (21) has a tooth
(22) engaged in a recess (13a) constituting the said internal arrangement on the

base (10).
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the said recess constitutes an
orifice (13a) of a ventilation duct (13) for the said base (10) and in that the said tooth

bears against an edge (13c) of the orifice situated on the same side as the front
opening of the base (10).
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the retaining lug (21) has a
recess (23) which allows circulation of air between the outside and inside of the

base (10) via the ventilation duct (13) when the said retaining lug (21) is snapped
into the base (10), and which gives the said lug the required degree of elasticity. 
Device according to either one of Claims 3 and 4, characterised in that a
ventilation box (30) is engaged in the ventilation duct outside the base and has a

tooth (31) for locking the said box cooperating with an edge of the orifice (13a)
distant from the front opening of the base (10).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the retaining
lug (21) is produced by moulding in a single piece with the intermediate screen (20).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the base (10)
is produced from moulded plastic and in that the means forming stops (11, 12)

comprise at least one shoulder moulded in one piece with the base (10).
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that two shoulders (11, 12) are
provided respectively in two opposite cheeks (10a, 10b) of the base, and in that the

said internal arrangement (13a) is provided in one of the said cheeks.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
intermediate screen (20) has, along at least one edge, at least one slot for

ventilating the generally closed space which it defines with the base (10).
