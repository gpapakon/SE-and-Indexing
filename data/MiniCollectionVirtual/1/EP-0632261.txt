<ABSTRACT>
Vibration sensors are used to monitor the resonant frequency of each 
cylinder of a multi-cylinder engine and the detection of an abnormal 

resonant frequency, i.e., one outside of an established range, is used as an 
indication that one or more specific cylinders is operating at an improper 

power level. Vibration signals associated with combustion in each cylinder 
can be used to perform FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) with the 

combustion resonant frequencies for all engine cycles being determined and 
an averaged resonant frequency for each cylinder obtained. Shifts in the 

averaged resonant frequency or the detection of a zero resonant frequency 
for only one of the cylinders can be used as an indication that the cylinder 

with the shifted or zero resonant frequency is experiencing a low power 
condition, including misfiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of combustion engine 
diagnostics. More specifically, the present invention is directed to methods 
and apparatus by which the performance of the combustion process in 
individual cylinders of a multi-cylinder engine can be monitored and low 
power level conditions detected. The cylinder pressure resonance phenomenon is well known and 
understood. Furthermore, as reflected by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,895,121 
(McCoy et al.), 5,119,783 (Komurasaki) and 5,144,929 (Hosoya et al.), 
this phenomenon is used in methods and apparatus for controlling engine 
operation for suppressing the occurrence of autoignition, i.e., knocking. 
In accordance with these disclosures, vibration sensors are used to monitor 
engine cylinder resonant frequencies produced during operation of a multicylinder 
engine, and the magnitude of the resonance frequency peaks are 
evaluated as a knocking indicator. The frequency range in which the 
resonant frequency occurs is not taken into consideration and the only 
abnormal combustion condition detected is knocking.  
 Additionally, in "Ein nuer Klopdetektor für Ottomoteren, Ein neues, 
empfindlicheres Verfahren zur Detektion von Klopfen bei Ottomotoren" [A 
New Knock Detector for Spark-Ignition Engines, a new more sensitive 
method of detecting knock in spark-ignition engines], N. Härle and J. F. 
Böhme, Automobil-Industrie, January, 1990, describes a more accurate 
manner of determining the existence of engine knocking using a 
microprocessor to perform complex vibration signal processing tasks 
including signal transformation, weighting, etc. By the described 
techniques, it is indicated that greater sensitivity can be obtained for 
determining that a detected level of resonance energy has exceeded a 
predetermined threshold indicative of knocking while minimizing the 
probability of a false indication of knocking being issued. Tests for the identification of low power cylinders in multi-cylinder 
engines which are not dependent on the detection of knocking are known. 
However, these tests can only be performed during engine idling condition 
through the use of cylinder cut-out techniques. Thus, such tests are not 
suitable for an on-board vehicle diagnostic system, and cannot be used to 
perform diagnostic tests under on-the-road driving conditions. A primary object of the invention is to provide a diagnostic system 
for internal combustion engines by which the performance of individual 
cylinders of a multi-cylinder engine can be monitored and
