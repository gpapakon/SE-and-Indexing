<ABSTRACT>
A system and associated method for monitoring 
and controlling the supersaturation and halide ion 

concentration, during the precipitation of a silver 
halide emulsion in a precipitation vessel are 

disclosed. The introduction of a silver salt is 
controlled in accordance with a predetermined program, 

which in turn is responding to the supersaturation 
signal measured in the vessel by a supersaturation 

sensor. The sensor is comprised of a true silver ion 
electrode and a silver-silver halide electrode. The 

introduction of the halide salt is controlled in 
accordance with the predetermined program, which in 

turn is responding to the halide ion concentration 
signal measured in the vessel by a silver-silver halide 

electrode and a reference electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the 
subject matter of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 
745,668, filed August 16, 1991, entitled "Process and 
Apparatus for Monitoring Supersaturation" and invented 
by M.J. Lin and J.S. Wey, the inventors of the present 
invention (a copy of which is enclosed). The present invention deals with the 
monitoring and control of supersaturation in silver 
halide precipitations wherein both silver and halide 
ion concentrations are selectively and independently 
measured and controlled using a true silver ion sensor 
and a halide ion sensor. During double-jet precipitation of AgX 
emulsions, the excess halide ion concentration or the 
silver ion concentration in the reaction vessel is 
often controlled to match a desired profile. This is 
normally done by comparing the e.m.f. (mV) signals from 
a "silver sensor" to a desired aim value (aim mV 
profile) via a process controller, which then issues  
 
control commands to correct for the deviation at any 
given time such that the desired profile can be 
maintained. U.S. Patent 4,933,870 by Y. Chang teaches 
one such state-of-the-art control system for 
accomplishing the above. Typically, the silver sensor 
for providing the e.m.f. signals is a coated silver 
electrode of the second kind: Ag/AgX. The control 
commands are used to regulate the rate of addition of a 
halide salt to the reaction vessel in order to achieve 
the aim mV profile. This conventional practice 
actually controls only the excess halide ion 
concentration in the reaction vessel. One of the most 
important parameters relating to crystal growth, the 
supersaturation level, is not controlled. The true 
driving force for crystal growth is the supersaturation 
level which ultimately determines the size, morphology, 
and the composition of the emulsion crystals. It may 
be defined as the ratio of the product of silver and 
halide ion concentrations, (Ag⁺) (X⁻), to the 
equilibrium solubility product, Ksp: S=(Ag⁺) (X⁻)/Ksp. 
Since the supersaturation involves both the halide and 
silver ion concentrations, a conventional control 
system cannot control the supersaturation level in the 
reaction vessel. An example of such deficiency is the 
renucleation phenomena in precipitations which is 
controlled under the identical mV profile based on the 
signals from a second-kind silver electrode. If the 
addition rate of silver and the matched salt reagents 
exceeds a critical value associated with the maximal 
supersaturation level, renucleation occurs under the 
same
