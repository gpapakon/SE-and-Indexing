<ABSTRACT>
A bifold door comprises a pair of door panels (12.1, 12.2) joined to one another along a centre hinge (14). Each door panel, at the end thereof remote from the centre hinge, is supported on a track (16) by a runner assembly (18) to which the door panel is pivotally connected. Each runner assembly is provided with a cam (32) whereby the runner assembly can releasably be locked in position with respect to the track (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to bifold doors.A bifold door is a type of door comprising
two door panels which are joined to one another along a
centre hinge. When the door is closed, the door panels
extend at an angle of 180° to one another. When it is
opened, the door panels hinge with respect to one
another about the centre hinge, in the manner of a
jack-knife, to extend at an angle of 0° or close to 0°
with respect to one another.Bifold doors are designed to open either to
the right or to the left. A bifold door that has been
designed for use in a left-opening configuration
cannot, after it has been installed, be changed from
one configuration to the other. This makes bifold
doors inflexible in their installation and use. It is
also difficult to clean them at the fixed end thereof
and areas surrounding the fixed end.Bi-fold door structures are disclosed in DE-A-3
241 994 and EP-A-0 346 050.In DE-A-3 241 994 a window is disclosed which
comprises an outer frame and two inner frames each
locating a pane of glass. The inner frames abut and
they are hinged together where they abut. The inner
frames include roller assemblies which run on tracks
forming part of the outer frame. Handles are provided
on the inner frames and these handles are used to move
upper and lower bolts which also carried by the inner
frames. Bolt holes are provided in the top and bottom
members of the outer frame. To lock the inner frames
to the outer frame, the handles are rotated so that the
upper and lower bolts are forced apart. The upper end 
of the upper bolt enters the upper bolt hole and the
lower end of the lower bolt enters the lower bolt hole.
Until the handle is rotated to withdraw the bolts from
the bolt holes, no amount of sideways force on the
inner frames will cause them to move to their open
positions. Clearly a lateral force on a bolt in a bolt
hole is ineffective to move the bolt sideways.EP-A-0 346 050 also discloses a bi-fold door
in which two panels are hinged together where they
abut. Both panels include, along the edges thereof
remote from the hinges which connect them, roller
assemblies which enable the panels to be moved along
upper and lower tracks between open and closed
positions. No means for locking the roller assemblies
to the tracks are disclosed.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a bifold door which can be used in either a
right-opening or left-opening configuration and which
can without difficulty, even after installation, be
changed from one configuration to the other if desired,
and which
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A bifold door which comprises a pair of door panels (12.1, 12.2) joined to one
another along a centre hinge (14) having a vertical hinge axis, each door panel being, at

the end thereof remote from the centre hinge, pivotal about a pivot axis (30) parallel to
the hinge axis, and each of the door panels being supported, at the end thereof remote

from the centre hinge (14), by an upper runner assembly (18) on an upper track (16) and
by a lower runner assembly on a lower track, each runner assembly being provided with

an element which in a first operative position restrains the runner assembly against
movement along the track and in a second inoperative position permits the runner

assembly to move along the track, characterised in that each of said elements is a cam
(32) mounted for rotation between said first and second positions, each cam (32) having

a surface which, as the cam rotates to its first position from its second position,
approaches said track (16) and bears on the track (16) to restrain movement of said

assembly along the track.
A bifold door as claimed in claim 1,

characterised in that the tracks (16) have recesses (42) therein into which recesses parts
(34) of the cams (32) enter when they are in their first positions.
A bifold door as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that each runner
assembly (18) comprises a pair of runner wheels (22) which are spaced apart along the

track, the cams (32) being disposed between the runner wheels (22). 
A bifold door as claimed in claim 3,

characterised in that the track (16) has a lip (26) on one side of the runner wheels (22)
for limiting transverse movement of the runner wheels with respect to the track, the cam

(32) being arranged to engage with the lip.
