<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a valve which utilises an imbalance of flow 
induced pressure forces to keep the valve open or closed. The valve has an interior 

cavity (15) into which an opposite and aligned inlet (12) and outlet (13) open. A 
bulbous body (16) is located within the cavity and is reciprocally mounted on a spindle 

(17) which passes through the outlet. Movement of the body increases the flow area at 
one end of the body and decreases the flow area at the other end of the body. In 

accordance with Bernoulli's theory this changes the pressures acting on the body (16) 
giving rise to a net force on the body. A cistern inlet valve (111, 211) and cistern (19) 

are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure and flow balanced hydraulic valve
which finds particular application as an inlet valve for cisterns (or flush tanks as they
are known in the USA)
and to a method for controlling the flow through such valves.
However, the valve of the present invention is not limited to
this particular application. The invention also relates to cistern inlet valves and
cisterns.Prior art valves for cisterns may be conveniently divided into two broad
categories. The first category is mechanical leverage valves having a valve seat with a
circular orifice therein, and a disc which is moved by a float arm to open or occlude the
circular orifice. A float attached to the float arm provides a buoyant force which is
magnified by the mechanical advantage available because of the length of the float arm.
Such an arrangement is relatively simple, very reliable, and has been in use for many
years.However, in recent times the average width of cisterns has been reduced
because of a reduction in the volume of water used to flush lavatory pans. Since
smaller volumes of water are required, corresponding reductions in the size of the
cisterns used to hold the flushing water have also been achieved. As a consequence,
the length of the float arm previously able to be used, cannot now be used for such
cisterns. As a result, the closing force of the mechanical inlet valve referred to above
is reduced. This renders this type of valve unsuitable for use in those areas having high
water pressures.As a consequence of this development, hydraulic inlet valves are increasingly
utilised in cisterns. A hydraulic inlet valve utilises the inlet pressure to assist in closing
the valve by applying inlet pressure to a relatively large opposite face of the valve
member so that a net closing force is achieved. However, hydraulic inlet valves suffer
from several disadvantages. One disadvantage is that in the event of a failure of one of
the valve components, the hydraulic inlet valve always fails open. That is to say, the
valve failure results in flow of water being unable to be stopped. Since the
consequence is a flooded bathroom and a substantial loss of water. by far the better
arrangement is that the valve, if it were to fail at all, should fail closed. Then the
consequence would be that no flow of water could be initiated.GB-A-861036 discloses a valve arrangement of the type specified
in the precharacterising portion of appended claim 1 wherein the pressure
of incoming water tends to maintain the valve on its

<CLAIMS>
A pressure an flow balanced valve (11, 111, 211)
comprising a valve housing which has an inlet (12, 112, 212)

leading into, and an outlet (14, 114, 214) leading from, an
interior cavity (15, 115, 215), whith said inlet and outlet

being substantially opposed, and a generally bulbous valve
body (16, 116, 216) located within said cavity and mounted for

movement towards and away from said outlet, said valve body
and outlet being sized to permit said outlet to be occluded by

said vavle body; characterized in that the interior suface of
said cavity (15, 115, 215) and the exterior surface of said

valve body (16, 116, 216) are shaped and arranged to reduce
the cross-sectional area available for flow towards said

outlet and between said valve body and cavity, and
simultaneously increase the cross-sectional area available for

flow from said inlet and between said valve body and cavity,
as said valve body moves towards said outlet, and vice versa

as said valve body moves away from said outlet, to thereby
alter the balance of the flow velocity induced pressure forces

acting on said valve body when said valve body (16, 116, 216)
moves through an equilibrium position at which the flow

induced pressure force is substantially zero. 
A valve as claimed in claim 1 wherein said valve body is mounted on
a spindle (17, 117, 217) which passes through said outlet.
A valve as claimed in claim 2 wherein said spindle is mounted for
longitudinal reciprocal motion thereof.
A valve as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said outlet is
curved (21, 23) and extends around said interior cavity towards said inlet.
A valve body as claimed in claim 4 wherein said outlet comprises a
plurality of parallel connected passage ways (248).
A valve body as claimed in claim 4 or 5 wherein said valve outlet (14,
214) surrounds said valve inlet (12, 212).
A valve as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein said outlet
includes at least one opening (130, 255) connected to atmosphere.

body (16, 116, 216) is selected from the group consisting of an ovoid, an ellipsoid and

a Rankine ovuloid.

cistern inlet valve (11, 111, 211).
A cistern inlet valve as claimed in claim 10 and mounted at the upper
end of a stem (128, 228) comprising an inlet for said cistern.
A cistern incorporating a cistern inlet valve (11, 111, 211) as claimed
in claim 10 or 11. 
A method of controlling flow through a pressure and flow
balanced valve (11, 111, 211) comprising a valve housing which

has an inlet (12, 112, 212) leading into, and an outlet (14,
114, 214) leading from, an interior cavity (15, 115, 215),

with said inlet and outlet being substantially opposed, and a
generally bulbous valve body (16, 116, 216) located within

said cavity, said method comprising the steps of: 

moving said valve body away from said outlet through an
equilibrium position at which said flow induced pressure force

is substantially zero to increase the cross-sectional area
available for flow between said body and said cavity adjacent

said outlet and to simultaneously reduce the cross-sectional
area available for flow between said body and said cavity

adjacent said inlet, to thereby apply a net flow induced
pressure force to said body acting to continue said valve body

motion away from said outlet and open said valve, and
moving said valve body towards said outlet to reduce the
cross-sectional area available for flow between said body and

said cavity adjacent said outlet and to simultaneously
increase the cross-sectional area available for flow between

said body and said cavity adjacent said inlet, to thereby
apply a net flow induced pressure force to said body acting to

continue said valve body motion towards said outlet and close
said valve.

substantially zero.
