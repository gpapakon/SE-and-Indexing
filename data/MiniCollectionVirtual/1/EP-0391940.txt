<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder unit has a cylinder portion (1) in which a piston provided with a piston rod (3) is reciprocally movable under the influence of a pressure medium which is supplied to the cylinder portion (1). In order to provide reliable guiding, also in the direction of rotation, to that object which is to be displaced by means of cylinder units, it applies that the piston rod (3) is, in its end, secured in a connecting piece (2) which is also provided with a number of guide rods (4, 5) in spaced-apart relationship about and parallel to the piston rod (3). The guide rods (4, 5) are slidably accommodated in corresponding guides in the cylinder portion (1) and suitably the connecting piece (2) and the cylinder portion (1) have a common cross-sectional configuration which includes outer, planar defining surfaces (12-14) with longitudinal undercut grooves (15-18).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CYLINDER DEVICETECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a cylinder unit with a cylinder portion in which a piston provided with a piston rod is reciprocally movable under the influence of a pressure medium supplied to the cylinder portion.The present invention also relates to a section-bar for producing a cylinder unit.BACKGROUND ARTCylinder units of the type mentioned by way of introduction are pre¬ viously known in many different variations and for many different fields of application. The cylinder portion proper may often be pro¬ vided with an anchorage flange, anchorage eye or the like for se- curing the cylinder portion, while the piston rod may be provided with an eye, threading or corresponding means for securing that part which is to be reciprocated by means of the cylinder unit.Prior art conventional cylinder units require extra auxiliary equip- ment in order that the object which is to be reciprocated by means of the cylinder unit can be reliably guided transversely of its di¬ rection of displacement and also in the direction of rotation with the direction of displacement as centre axis. For example, use has been made of various types of guides in which, for instance, rollers have catered for low-frictional guiding. 

Common to all of these prior art arrangements is a considerable space requirement and, in addition, such prior art arrangements suf¬ fer from drawbacks in respect of convenient anchorage of both the cylinder portion and that part which is to be reciprocated.OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONThe object of the present invention is to realise a cylinder unit of the type mentioned by way of introduction, the cylinder unit being designed in such a manner as to offer both the possibility of reci¬ procal motion and total guiding of the object which is reciprocated, i.e. transversely of the direction of displacement and in the di¬ rection of rotation about the longitudinal direction of the piston rod. The present invention also has for its object to realise a cylinder unit which is easy to mount and which permits simple an¬ chorage and adjustment of both the cylinder portion and the object which is to be displaced. The present invention further has for its object to realise a cylinder unit which is both simple and econ¬ omical in manufacture, with varying stroke lengths, and which is otherwise designed in an extremely versatile manner.The present invention yet further has for its object to realise a section-bar which is intended for producing a cylinder unit.SOLUTIONThe objects forming

CLAIMS
1. A cylinder unit with a cylinder portion (1) in which a piston provided with a piston rod (3) is reciprocally movable under the in¬ fluence of a pressure medium supplied to the cylinder portion, char¬ acterised in that the piston rod (3) is, in its end facing away from the cylinder portion (1), secured in a connecting piece (2); that a number of guide members (4, 5) are secured in the connecting piece in spaced-apart relationship from the piston rod (3) and directed parallel therewith; and that the guide members are slidably accom¬ modated in corresponding guide apertures in the .cylinder portion.
2. The cylinder unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that both the cylinder portion (1) and the connecting piece (2) have the same cross-sectional configuration transversely of the longitudinal axis of the cylinder portion; and that the cross-sectional con- figuration includes planar, outer defining surfaces (12-14) in which longitudinal, undercut grooves (15-18) are provided.
3. The cylinder unit as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the longitudinal cylinder bore (21) in the cylinder portion (1) in which the piston is reciprocally movable is disposed centrally in the cylinder portion; and that the guide apertures are disposed con¬ centrically about the centre axis of the cylinder bore, preferably with the same angle distribution.
4. A section-bar for producing a cylinder unit, characterised by a centrally disposed, longitudinal and circular-cylindrical bore (21), a number of additional bores (22) disposed in spaced-apart re¬ lationship from the central bore, parallel with the central bore and preferably disposed equidisant therefrom, the section-bar having outer defining surfaces (12-14) which are approximately planar.
5. The section-bar as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the approximately planar surfaces (12-14) are approximately at right angles to one another and are provided with undercut, longitudinal grooves (15-18), preferably so-called T-grooves.
