<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel group of compounds which are
useful in the treatment of bladder instability in mammals such as man.
More specifically, this invention relates to this group of compounds, their
use in the treatment of urinary incontinence in mammals (including man),
processes for preparing them and pharmaceutical compositions containing
them.It is known that bladder tissue is excitable and that urinary
incontinence can be caused by uncontrolled or unstable bladder
contractions. A group of compounds have been found that are unexpectedly
capable of relaxing bladder smooth muscle, thus preventing or ameliorating
uncontrolled or unstable bladder contractions. Hence, the compounds may be
useful for the treatment of urge incontinence, which includes for example
detrusor instability, which may result from cystitis, urethritis, tumors,
stones, diverticuli or outflow obstruction; and detrusor hyperreflexia,
which may result from stroke, dementia, Parkinsons, suprasacral spinalcord
injury or suprasacral spinalcord disease.This invention provides a compound of formula I (formula set out,
together with other formulae referred to by Roman numerals, on pages
following the Examples), wherein:
Ar is phenyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrazinyl, 2-pyrimidyl,
4-pyrimidyl, 3- pyridazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, 3-isothiazolyl, 4-isothiazolyl,
5-isothiazolyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl,
4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl and 3-thienyl
; A-B is NHCO;Y is sulfonyl or carbonyl;R2 and R3 are fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl,
2,2,2-trifluoroethyl or perfluoroethyl; and R3 is methyl, fluoromethyl,
difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl or perfluoroethyl;
R9 is fluoro, chloro, cyano, nitro, methyl or methoxy; and R10 and R11 are
hydrogen;
or a pharmaceutically acceptable invivo hydrolyzable ester of said
compound of formula I;
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or said ester. The invention further provides the use of a compound of
formula I as defined above. 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or said ester;
for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of urinary
incontinence.The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a compound of formula I as defined above, or a pharmaceutically
acceptable invivo hydrolyzable ester of said 
compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said
compound or said ester, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or
carrier.In
