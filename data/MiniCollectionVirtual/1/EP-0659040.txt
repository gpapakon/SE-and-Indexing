Add-on module adapted to be mounted on a 
variable speed drive and including a casing containing an 

electronic circuit and provided at the rear with a 
connector adapted to plug into a corresponding connector 

provided on said variable speed drive, wherein said 
casing is generally L-shape with a front portion carrying 

said connector adapted to be positioned in front of the 
front of said variable speed drive and a second portion 

accommodated on one side of said variable speed drive, 
said electronic circuit including front and side printed 

circuit boards electrically connected to each other and 
the angle between which is substantially equal to the 

angle between said front and second portions of said 
casing. 
Module according to claim 1 wherein said side 

circuit board carries a connector for a memory card 
disposed to enable insertion of said memory card on the 

side of said case of said variable speed drive. 
Module according to claim 1 wherein said two 
circuit boards are connected by bent pins. 
Module according to claim 1 wherein said side 
portion of said casing has fixing means cooperating with 

fixing means on the side of said case of said variable 
speed drive. 
Module according to claim 1 wherein the front of 
said module carries a cable clamp below an opening for 

inserting a memory card.
