<ABSTRACT>
A composition for treatment of Alzheimer's disease which 
contains idebenone in an amount of about 50 mg or more in a 

dose. Oral administration of idebenone to a patient with 
Alzheimer's disease at a dose of 50 mg or more per 

administration is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a cause of
dementia.The incidence of dementia is increasing in the ageing society. Alzheimer's
disease, in particular, is of major concern, calling for the elucidation of its cause and the
development of a therapy.The specification of U.S. Patent No. 5059627 describes that idebenone is effective
in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease when administered at daily doses of 0.1 to 500
mg in adults. That specification, however, presents no specific pharmacological data
which demonstrate the effect, except for the induction and promotion of nerve growth
factor (NGF) secretion observed using mouse astroglias, and presents no clinical data on
idebenone administration to patients with Alzheimer's disease.Also, on pages 249-260 of Arch. Gerontol, Geriatr., Vol. 15, (1992), it is stated
that idebenone proved effective in patients with Alzheimer's disease when administered
at 45 mg twice a day (daily dose 90 mg). That publication, however, describes no cases
where idebenone was administered at doses exceeding 50 mg per administration or 90 mg
per day.It is generally held that the efficacy of pharmaceuticals does not improve when
the dose is increased above conventional doses because the toxicity increases. Despite
this, the present inventors found that a more excellent effect than expected can be
obtained by administering idebenone to patients with Alzheimer's disease at 50 mg or
more per administration or 150 mg or more per day, high doses not used conventionally.
The inventors conducted investigations based on this finding, and developed the present
invention.Accordingly, the present invention provides a use of idebenone for the
manufacture of a medicament for oral administration for the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease comprising a unit dosage of 90 mg or more of idebenone, wherein the amount
of idebenone for administration per day is 270 mg.The invention also provides a use of idebenone for the manufacture of a
medicament for oral administration for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease comprising
a unit dosage of 90 mg or more of idebenone, wherein the amount of idebenone for
administration per day is 360 mg.The invention also provides a use of idebenone for the manufacture of a
medicament for oral administration for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease comprising
a unit dosage of 90 mg or more of idebenone, wherein the amount of idebenone for
administration per day is 450 mg.Idebenone as used in the present invention is described in the
