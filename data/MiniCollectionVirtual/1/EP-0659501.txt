<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a forging machine which is provided with rams, especially four, which are arranged in an x shape in one plane with a 90 DEG  offset between them, act radially on workpieces guided longitudinally along the system axis and are fitted with tools. To ensure that the tools form a closed pass in adjustable stroke end positions, they are connected to the rams by way of slides (saddles) and are adjustable transversely to the axis of the rams, releasable clamping elements, each of which clamps one slide positively against a ram end face, being provided. The suction which arises during the removal of the slides from the ram end face and during their deposition can lead to the penetration of dirt (scale) into the gaps between the ram end faces and the slides. In order to exclude this, the slides (17) are, according to the invention, provided on their sides parallel to the plane of adjustment with teeth (40) transverse to the direction of adjustment, into/from which locking pieces (42) immobilised on the rams (2) in the direction of adjustment can be engaged and disengaged. In particular, the locking pieces (42) are secured on the ram (2) in a manner which allows them to be pivoted about pivots (41) parallel to the direction of adjustment and are provided at their free end, the ends facing the slides (17), with teeth which correspond to the teeth (40) on the slides (17).

A forging machine with four rams (2) which are arranged in a cruciform manner in one 
plane, are offset at 90Â° to one another, act radially upon the workpiece guided longitudinally 

in the system axis (
S
) and are equipped with tools (3), wherein the tools (3) are displaceable 
in their common plane by means of tool supports (17) by displacement devices 

(23), acting upon the supports (17), transversely to the rams (2) and the supports (17) can 
be set with respect to the rams (2) by engageable and disengageable positive locking 

means (42) and releasable clamping devices (30 to 36), 
characterized in that
 the supports 
(17) are provided on their sides parallel to the displacement plane with sets of teeth 

(40) transversely to the displacement direction, into and out of which locking members 
(42), locked on the rams (2) in the displacement direction, can be engaged and disengaged. 
A forging machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the locking members 
(42) are secured to the ram (2) so as to be pivotable about shafts (41) parallel to the displacement 

direction and are provided at their free ends, facing the supports (17), with sets 
of teeth corresponding to the sets of teeth (40) on the supports (17). 
A forging machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 springs (46) are 
provided to engage the locking members (42), the springs (46) being counteracted by 

piston-cylinder units (45, 47) which can be acted upon in order to disengage the locking 
members (42).
