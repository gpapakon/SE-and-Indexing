<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a vibration wave motor. 
The vibration wave motor has frequency-velocity 

characteristics that the velocity abruptly changes in a 
frequency region lower than the resonance frequency, 

and the velocity Slowly changes in a frequency region 
higher than the resonance frequency. According to this 

invention, in consideration of the above 
characteristics, the startup characteristics of the 

motor are improved by driving the motor in a frequency 
region lower than the resonance frequency as a main 

region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving device 
for a vibration type actuator device and, more 
particularly, to a driving device for a vibration type 
actuator device, which can achieve an accurate driving 
operation at high speed. In a vibration type actuator device (e.g., a 
vibration wave motor), a vibration member is prepared 
by adhering a piezoelectric element or an 
electrostrictive element as an electro-mechanical 
energy conversion element on one surface of an elastic 
member of, e.g., a metal, such as an elastic member 
formed into an elliptic shape. The piezoelectric 
element is subjected to polarization processing before 
assembly into the vibration member. When AC electric 
fields having a predetermined phase difference 
therebetween are applied to the piezoelectric element, 
traveling vibration waves are generated on the other 
surface of the elastic member. When the surface, on which the traveling vibration 
waves are generated, of the elastic member is defined 
as a driving surface, a contact member is brought into 
contact with the driving surface by a pressing means,  
 
thereby generating a relative driving force between the 
elastic member and the contact member by a friction 
force. The contact member includes a rotor for picking 
up a rotation force, a rail for a linear motion, a 
sheet such as paper, or the like. In a vibration type actuator device of this type, 
since the contact member is always in press-contact 
with the elastic member of the vibration member, when 
the driving voltage supplied to the vibration member is 
stopped, a movable member is immediately stopped, thus 
providing characteristics suitable for alignment with 
high accuracy. On the other hand, the following control methods 
for driving the vibration type actuator device are 
known: 
(1) a method of setting the frequency of the 
driving voltage to be the resonance frequency of the 
vibration member, as described in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application No. 61-203873; and (2) a method of controlling the frequency of the 
driving voltage in a frequency region higher than the 
resonance frequency of the vibration member, as 
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 
No. 62-203575. The vibration type actuator device has 
frequency-velocity characteristics that the velocity 
changes abruptly in a frequency region lower than the  
 
resonance frequency of the vibration member, and it 
changes slowly in a frequency region higher than the 
resonance frequency. Thus, a frequency region higher 
than the
