<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring device at least for testing the connections between at least two assemblies (3, 4, 5) having a test arrangement (1) for producing a test signal which is supplied to a test arrangement output and for evaluating an analysis signal which is supplied from an assembly (3, 4, 5), is formed from the test signal and is received at a test arrangement input. The test arrangement (1) is also provided for feeding a switching control signal to a control arrangement (10, 11, 12) contained on an assembly (3, 4, 5). An assembly (3, 4, 5) contains a switching device (7, 8, 9) which is controlled by the assigned control arrangement (10, 11, 12) and is provided for routing a test signal or an intermediate signal formed from the test signal to an assembly test input and for receiving at least one further intermediate signal from an assembly test output. A switching device (7, 8, 9) is provided, in a first switching state, for coupling the assembly test input to the test arrangement output and the assembly test output to an auxiliary connection (BR) and, in a second switching state, for coupling the assembly test input to an auxiliary connection (BR) and the assembly test output to the test arrangement input or to a further auxiliary connection (BR).

A measuring device used at least for testing the connections between at least
two subassemblies (3, 4, 5), comprising a test system (1) for generating a test signal

available on an output of the test system and for evaluating an analysis signal produced by a
subassembly (3, 4, 5) from the test signal and received on an input of the test system,


characterized in that
 the test system (1) is also provided for applying a switch control signal
to a controller (10, 11, 12) included in a subassembly (3, 4, 5), 
in that
 a subassembly (3, 4,
5) includes a switching circuit (7, 8, 9) controlled by the assigned controller (10, 11, 12),

formed from this test signal to a test input of a subassembly and for receiving at least a

further intermediate signal from a test output of a subassembly, and

least one circuit arrangement in a subassembly (3, 4, 5), the switching circuit (7, 8, 9) in a

third position is provided for coupling the test input of the subassembly to the output of the
test system and for coupling the test output of the subassembly to the input of the test

system.
A measuring device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 there is
no coupling between the test input of the subassembly (3, 4, 5) and the output of the test

system and between the test output of the subassembly and the input of the test system if
the switching circuit (7, 8, 9) of a subassembly not to be tested is in a fourth position.
A measuring device as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the
test system (1) includes a test generator for generating a test signal and a test clock signal,

 the test system (1) includes an evaluation circuit (2) for generating a test control
signal to be transported to the subassembly (3, 4, 5) and denoting a test operation and for 

evaluating an analysis signal, and

 the switching circuit (7, 8, 9) of a subassembly (3,
4, 5) which switching circuit is controlled in response to the switch control signal is used in

the first, second and third switching positions to apply the test clock signal to the circuit
arrangements of the subassemblies (3, 4, 5).
A measuring device as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
