<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and device for applying a material pattern by means of a sequentially operating applicator (14) to a substrate (18) moving relative to said applicator (14), by way of a control valve for liquid material, in particular a hot melt, said valve being controllable for opening and closing, which material pattern in the direction of movement is sub-divided into pattern parts with slight spacing between them, and there being at least two control valves (24, 26) connected to the material supply, and the respective valves being made to open and close sequentially. A considerably faster operation is achieved in this way.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for applying a
material pattern by means of an applicator to a substrate
moving relative to said applicator, by way of a control
valve for liquid material, in particular a hot melt, said
valve being controllable for opening and closing and being
connected to a material supply, which material pattern in
the direction of movement is sub-divided into pattern parts
with slight spacing between them, and to a device for
carrying out said method.Applying a liquid material, in particular a hot
melt, by means of an applicator to a substrate by way of a
control valve with controllable opening and closing is a
technique which is known per se.So long as the speed of the material relative to
the applicator remains below certain values and the space
between the pattern parts is not too small, no particular
problems occur, despite the fact that, particularly in the
case of pneumatically operated valves, for obtaining a
well-defined pattern, i.e. not ragged, large-size air
supply and discharge ducts are needed in order to be able
to supply and evacuate the control air in a short time.However, the situation changes when the relative
speed increases and the space between the pattern parts has
to be small. In this case the time which elapses between
quickly making the valve close and subsequently quickly
making the valve open is too short to obtain a good effect.
This problem occurs in particular in the case of
pneumatically controlled valves, in the case of which considerable
quantities of air have to be supplied or
discharged through large-size ducts in order to obtain the
desired rapid opening and closing of the valves.The object of the invention is to provide a 
solution to this problem. According to the invention, for
this purpose use is made of at least two control valves
for controlling the outflow of material from an outflow aperture
of a nozzle which are connected to the material supply and are made to
open and close sequentially.If, for example, there are two control valves and
the first of these two is made to close at the end of its
working cycle through rapid evacuation of the control air,
and is not in a position to allow material through again
very shortly afterwards by being made to open, the function
of said first valve is taken over by the second valve,
which is made to open at the correct moment; during the
open period of this second valve, there is an opportunity
for the situation in the first valve to recover, and said
first valve is ready for the next working cycle
