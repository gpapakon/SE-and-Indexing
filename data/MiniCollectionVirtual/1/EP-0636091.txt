<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for the transportation of goods, such as paper rolls, comprising a load carrier which includes a goods-carrying bottom plate. The arrangement is mainly characterized by a lifting post (4) which is upstanding centrally from the bottom plate (2) and by means of which a loaded load-carrier can be lifted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement pertaining to 
the transportation of goods, such as paper rolls, comprising a 
load carrier which includes a carrying bottom plate, and a 
lifting post which is upstanding centrally from the bottom 
plate and includes a hoist fitting and preferably includes a 
lashing band for securing the load, the lifting post being free 
standing. FR-A-1 416 891 disclose a carriage moveable on wheels having 
plates or the like on several different levels for the storage 
of small objects. These carrier plates are supported by a 
lifting post including a hoist fitting, the lifting post in 
turn being supported by a rod anchored to the chassis of the 
carriage. By lifting the lifting post the different carrier 
plates can be brought to a suitable level for a person to reach 
the objects carried thereon. Such a carrier anticipates the 
features of the introductory portion of Claim 1.  
 The transportation of large paper rolls from the paper machine 
to the final consumer is encumbered with problems in the form 
of a large number of handling and trans-shipment or reloading 
operations, among other things. These operations are time-consuming, 
risk intensive and relatively often result in damage 
to the rolls. The present invention provides a solution to these problems. In accordance with the invention, the solution consists 
in that the lifting 
post is anchored to the bottom plate and in that the arrangement 
comprises a cover plate which is arranged to protect the 
upper surfaces of paper rolls placed on the bottom plate, and 
includes an aperture such that the cover plate is slidable 
along and removable from the post.  
 The invention will now be described in more detail with reference 
to exemplifying embodiments thereof and also with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, in which 
Figure 1 is a schematic, perspective view of a first embodiment 
of an inventive unloaded load carrier; Figure 2 illustrates the load carrier shown in Figure 1 
carrying a load of four paper rolls; Figure 3 illustrates handling of a load carrier with the aid 
of a fork-lift truck; Figure 4 illustrates handling of the load carrier in accordance 
with the invention, with the aid of a crane arrangement; Figure 5 illustrates handling of load carriers in accordance 
with the invention with the aid of a traverse hoist arrangement; Figure 6 illustrates a combination of material handling 
situations;  
 Figure 7 illustrates schematically a warehouse in accordance 
with Figure 6; and Figure 8

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement pertaining to the transportation of goods, 
such as paper rolls, comprising a load carrier which includes 

a carrying bottom plate, and a lifting post (4) which is 
upstanding centrally from the bottom plate (2) and includes 

a hoist fitting (11) and preferably includes a lashing band 
for securing the load, the lifting post being free standing, 


characterized
 in that the lifting post (4) is anchored 
to the bottom plate, and in that the arrangement 

comprises a cover plate (5) which 
has an aperture (7) for the post such that the cover plate is 

slidable along and removable from said post, whereby the 
cover plate can be arranged to protect the upper surfaces (6) of paper 

rolls placed on the bottom plate. 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the lifting post is removably mounted. 
An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the lifting post can be extended and 
shortened. 
An arrangement according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
 in that the lifting hoist (11) includes a housing 
which includes an upwardly facing, elongated opening (12) 

through which a preferably generally arrow-headed lifting head 
is intended to be inserted and locked by rotation and released 

by further rotation, said rotational movement preferably being 
effected by pressing the head against an internal bottom 

surface of the housing. 
An arrangement according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, 
character-ized
 by a lifting device (15) for coaction 
with a crane arrangement (16), a traverse hoist (17) or some 

like lifting arrangement, and at least one load carrier (1). 
An arrangement according to anyone of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized
 in that the bottom plate is generally  
 

quadratic and is constructed to accommodate four paper 
rolls of essentially quadratic configuration. 
An arrangement according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized
 in that the bottom plate is provided 
with pockets (8) for handling with a fork-lift truck (9). 
An arrangement according to anyone of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized
 by means for connecting 
at least two mutually adjacent load carriers together for 

supporting, for instance, long goods, such as packaged wood. 
An arrangement according to anyone of claims 1 to 8, 
8, 9 or 10, 
characterized
 in that the load 
carrier is intended for use in combination with bag-like 

containers intended, for instance, for handling granular 
goods. 
An arrangement according to Claim 9, 
characterized
 in that the container includes a centrally located 
channel which is intended to be inserted over the lifting post 

and in which the lifting post is intended to extend, therewith 
holding the container to the load carrier.
