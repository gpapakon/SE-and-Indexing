<ABSTRACT>
A system for transferring a flowable medium, especially oil, to or from a floating vessel (1), comprising a buoyancy unit in the form of a submerged buoy (2) which is anchored to the sea bed (4) and which is connected to at least one transfer line (6) for medium, a downwardly open receiving means (3) arranged on the vessel (1) below the water surface and arranged for receipt and connection of the buoy (2), a hoisting means (11) for raising the buoy (2) for introduction threreof into the receiving means (3), and a means for allowing the vessel to turn about a vertical axis through the buoy (2) when this is connected in the receiving means (3). The receiving means is a module (3) arranged at a submerged location at the outer side of the hull of the vessel, and preferably is built into the low portion of the vessel, and the buoy (2) comprises an outer buoyancy member (21) and centrally therein a rotatably mounted member (22) for the passage of medium. Further, in the inner space of the module (3) there is provided a locking mechanism (38, 39) for releasable locking of the outer buoyancy member (21) to the module (3), so that the outer member (21) will turn about the central member (22) with turning of the vessel (1), a coupling unit (29), which is associated with a tube system (30) provided on the vessel (1) for the transfer of medium, being connected to the central member (22) through a swivel means (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for transferring 
a flowable medium to or from a floating vessel, comprising 
a buoy for coupling to at least one transfer line for 
transfer of the medium and is anchored to the sea bed so as to 
be submerged at a desired depth when it is not in use, a vessel 
having a downwardly open receiving space arranged for receipt and 
securing of the buoy, the buoy being of the type comprising a 
central, bottom-anchored member arranged for passage of medium 
from the transfer line via a coupling unit to a pipe system on 
the vessel, and an outer buoyancy member which is mounted on the 
central member to allow turning of the vessel about the central 
member when the outer member is secured in the receiving space, 
and a hoisting means arranged on a deck of the vessel for 
hoisting of the buoy into the receiving space. There are previously known different types of loading/unloading 
systems for the transfer of hydrocarbons, i.e. oil and 
gas, by means of a submerged buoy which, during operation, is 
received in a downwardly open receiving space on a vessel. Such 
a system, which exhibits the above stated features, for example 
is known from US patent specification No. 4 490 121. This patent 
specification shows a mooring system in the form of a buoy 
loading system which, in some of the illustrated embodiments, 
comprises a buoy of the stated type. Thus, the buoy comprises an 
outer buoyancy member which is arranged for releasable securing 
in the receiving space, and a central member on which the outer 
member is rotatably mounted, the central member being anchored 
to the sea bed, so that the vessel may turn about the central 
member when the outer member is secured in the receiving space. 
The lower end of the central member is connected to at least one 
transfer line for transfer of medium, and the upper end is 
connected via a coupling unit to a pipe system on the vessel. In 
this known system the receiving space for the buoy is arranged 
in an arm projecting from and being fastened to the vessel above 
the water surface, so that the buoy, when this is placed in the  
 
receiving space, is lifted partly or in its entirety out of the 
water. Thus, both the receiving space and the buoy are subjected 
to the possibly rough or stormy surface conditions. It will be 
clear that such a system is subject to substantial weather 
limitations and will not be able to be operative in rather high 
sea, both because of practical difficulties in connection and 
disconnection, and

A system for transferring a flowable medium to or from 
a floating vessel, the system comprising: 


a buoy (2) for coupling to at least one transfer line 
(6) for transfer of the medium and is anchored to the sea bed (4) 

so as to be submerged at a desired depth when it is not in use, 
a vessel (1) having a downwardly open receiving space (3) 
arranged for reception and securement of the buoy, the buoy being 

of the type comprising a central, bottom-anchored member (22) 
arranged for passage of medium from the transfer line (6) via a 

coupling unit (29) to a pipe system (30) on the vessel (1), and
