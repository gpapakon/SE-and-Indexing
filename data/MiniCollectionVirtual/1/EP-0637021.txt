<ABSTRACT>
A front mechanism 760 mounted on a chassis 
100 loads a cassette 600 in place by causing projections 

765a, 765b on each of opposite side portions of a 
cassette carrying tray 765 to slide along respective 

guide grooves 764, 772 formed in each of side plates 
762, 763. Power is transmitted from a drive cam gear 

740 provided on the rear side of the chassis 100 to 
the tray 765 via a driv
e mechanism 560, intermediate 
gear 768 and rotary gear 766. For loading, the tray 

765 initially starts to move as inclined with the 
projections 765a, 765b sliding along slanting grooves 

764c, 772c and is thereafter lowered by sliding 
movement of the projection 765b along a vertical groove 

772b and sliding movement of the projection 765a along 
a descent groove 764d while being corrected from the 

inclined position to a horizontal position. Upon 
completion of cassette loading, the intermediate gear 

768 and the rotary gear 766 constitute a Geneva stop, 
and the drive cam gear 740 disengages from the drive 

mechanism 560. A support guide 460 supporting the drive 
mechanism 560 is provided by being formed by outsert 

molding inside the chassis 100 and thereafter being 
rotated to project from a side portion of the chassis 

100.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cassette
loading device for use in magnetic recording-reproduction
apparatus for reciprocatingly moving
a magnetic tape-accommodating cassette between an
insertion-discharge position and a loaded position.EP-A-0 335 323
discloses a device which is known as such a
cassette loading device. In the following description,
one side of the device where a rotary cylinder 800 is
provided will be referred to as "front," and the
other side thereof where there is a cassette insertion-discharge
position as "rear." This document is used for the delimitation of claim 1.With reference to FIGS. 21 to 23 showing the
disclosed device, a chassis 100 has a pair of side
plates 762, 763 thereon, and a tray 765 for holding
a cassette thereon is disposed between the two side
plates 762, 763 and in the rear of reel supports 200a,
200b. A top plate 775 is connected between the upper
ends of the side plates 762, 763 as indicated in
broken lines. A front panel 770 attached to the rear 
end of the chassis 100 has a height approximately equal
to the height of the upper surface of the top plate
775 from the upper surface of the chassis 100.Opposite sides of the tray 765 are bent
upward to provide cassette holding plates 771, 771.
Each cassette holding plate 771 has two projections
765a, 765b projecting therefrom sideways. The
projections 765a, 76b fit respectively in approximately
L-shaped guide grooves 764, 772 which are formed in each
of the side plates 762, 763. The cassette is in an
insertion-discharge position when the projections 765a,
765b are in contact with the rear ends of the
respective grooved portions 764, 772. The cassette is
in a loaded position when the projections 765a, 765b
are brought to the lower ends of the respective guide
grooves 764, 772. The guide groove 772 comprises a
slanting portion 772a slanting upward toward the front
and a descent portion 772b extending from the front end
of the slanting portion 772a downward as slightly
slanted rearward and communicating with the slanting
portion 772a. The guide groove 764 comprises a slanting
portion 764a approximately parallel to the slanting
portion 772a and a vertical portion 764b extending
threfrom.A gear lever 780 is supported by a shaft on 
the right side plate 763 and has an arm 780a. The
arm has a pin 787 projecting outward from its forward
end. A link 785 has one end fitting to the projection
765a on the tray 765 and the other end loosely fitting
to the pin 787. The link 785 is connected to the arm
780a by a tension spring
</DESCRIPTION>
