<ABSTRACT>
An assembly useful in conjunction with a signal 
transmission means for the measurement of a compositional 

parameter of the blood of a patient is disclosed. This 
assembly comprises a housing adapted and sized to be located 

outside the body of a patient and having a fluid flow 
passage therethrough into which blood from the patient is 

passed from a hollow tube, the fluid flow passage being 
defined by a wall which is substantially impermeable to 

blood, the housing being adapted to be removably secured to 
a signal transmission system such that the housing is 

capable of being removed from the signal transmission system 
without disrupting the fluid flow passage; and a sensing 

element located in the housing in or near the fluid flow 
passage for provding a signal directly to the signal 

transmission system in response to a compositional parameter 
of blood located in the fluid flow passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is often necessary or desirable to measure
various parameters of blood, such as temperature, pressure
and compositional parameters of blood, i.e., the presence
and/or concentration of blood constituents, such as blood
gases, hydrogen ions (pH), other electrolytes, glucose, red
blood cells and the like. Measurement of compositional
parameters of blood can be accomplished in real time using
fluorescent sensors. For example, this can be accomplished
in an extracorporeai blood loop as shown in Cooper U.S. No.
4,640,820 and in vivo as disclosed in Lubbers et al Reissue
Patent No. 31,879. The system disclosed in this Cooper
patent involves a fluid (blood) passageway partly defined
by membranes which are permeable to one or more blood
constituents. For in vivo sensing, a probe or catheter
carrying an appropriate sensor is inserted into a blood
vessel of the patient. Because blood vessels are quite
small, sensors designed to be inserted in such vessels must
be very small. This size constraint may have a detrimental
effect on the accuracy of the determination made by the
sensor.US-A-4008717 discloses a portable constant withdrawal
device connected to tubing, including a catheter which is
inserted intravenously through a disposal needle into a
subject. The device has a housing located outside the body
of a patient and having a fluid flow passage therethrough
into which blood of the patient may be passed. The housing
has first and second housing components defining a fluid
flow passage with a membrane in between
which is permeable to blood and inserted
into the fluid flow passage is a sensor probe which
responds to the generation of electrical energy in relation
to the concentration of diffusible materials in the fluid,
blood of a patient. According to this invention there is provided an
assembly for use in measuring a compositional parameter of
the blood of a patient as claimed in claim 1 herein.The present invention is based in part on the
recognition and discovery that only a small amount of blood
is needed to obtain accurate and reliable blood analyses.
Thus, for example, a system which is structured to draw a
relatively limited amount of blood from a patient can
provide satisfactory measurements. Further, by isolating
the blood flow path from the more expensive analytical
equipment, the component which includes the flow path can
be economically and effectively disposed of after use,
thereby avoiding cross-patient blood contamination. The
sensing element of the present system is advantageously
located

<CLAIMS>
An assembly (11) for use in measuring a compositional
parameter of the blood of a patient comprising


a housing (35, 45) adapted and sized to be located
outside the body of the patient and having a fluid flow

passage (41) therethrough into which blood from said patient
can be passed, said housing including first (35) and second

(45) housing components defining said fluid flow passage (41),
as well as a sensing element, and characterized by
said fluid flow passage being substantially impermeable
to blood, said first housing component (35) being

substantially transparent, and said sensing element being
an optical sensing element (67, 69,

71) carried by said substantially transparent first housing
component (35) in or near said fluid flow passage (41) for

providing an optical signal through said first housing
component (35) in response to a compositional parameter of

blood.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein blood from said patient
is passed to said fluid flow passage (41) from a hollow tube

(33) in fluid communication with a blood vessel of said
patient, said first housing component (35) including first and

second tubing fittings (37, 39) acting to secure first (21)
and second (33) segments of hollow tubing to said housing and

first portions of first and second fluid flow channels (62,
64) each of which terminate in said fluid flow passage (41),

said second housing component (45) including second portions
of said first and second fluid flow channels (62, 64). 
The Assembly of claims 1 or 2 which comprises more
than one said sensing element (67, 69, 71), each of said

sensing elements providing a signal to a signal 
transmission means (65) in response to a different

compositional parameter of blood located in said fluid flow
passage (41), each of said sensing elements being a

fluorescent sensing element.
The assembly of any preceding claim which further
comprises volume oscillator means (27) in fluid

communication with said fluid flow passage (41) for urging
blood from said patient to flow in said fluid flow passage,

said volume oscillator means (27) being structured and
located so that substantially no net pumping of blood

results from the operation thereof.
The assembly of any preceding claim which further
comprises signal transmission means (65) for transmitting

said signal or signals from said sensing element or said

transmission means (65) includes at least one optical fiber

receive a portion of said signal transmission means (65)

transmission means.
The assembly of any preceding claim wherein said
housing (35, 45) includes one or more indents (57, 59, 61)
