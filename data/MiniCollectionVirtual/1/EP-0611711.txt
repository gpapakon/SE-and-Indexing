<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor for bottles or similar containers is composed of at least one conveying element, the frame (2) of which rests on a supporting surface or floor by means of feet (4). Connecting pieces (8) are used to connect the frame to the feet and/or to connect profile sections which form the feet. Each connecting piece is composed of two parts, at least one of which is produced by permanent deformation from a sheet steel blank, and each connecting piece has sections which enclose two profile sections which are arranged perpendicularly to one another and are connected to one another via the connecting piece.

Transport means for bottles or similar containers, including at least one 
transport element comprised of at least one frame (2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) and at least 

one transport conveyor, said transport means also including base portions (4, 
4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4g) respectively connected to said at least one frame (2-2d) 

by at least one connector (8) having first clamping portions (11) that via 
tightening means (16) are clamped onto a length of a profiled member of said at 

least one frame (2 - 2 d) such that in a position of use said base portions (4 - 4 
g) project beyond an underside of said frame (2 - 2 d), wherein each frame (2 - 2 

d), in the vicinity of said base portions (4 - 4 g), is provided with a transverse 
member (6 - 6 d) that forms said length of a profiled member and is disposed at 

a right angle to a longitudinal direction of said transport means, with said at least 
one connector (8) that connects a respective one of said base portions (4 - 4 g) 

to said frame (2 - 2 d) engaging said transverse member (6 - 6 d) such that 
loosening of said tightening means (16) allows said base portion (4 - 4 g) to 

pivot about an axis of said transverse member (6 - 6 d), with said connector (8) 
comprising two parts, wherein said two parts (8', 8
) of said connector (8) are 
detachably interconnected at an edge of said connector via positively 

interconnected connecting means (18, 19) and wherein said two parts (8', 8
) 
are interconnected by said connecting means (18, 19) so as to be pivotable 

about an axis that extends parallel to said edge (17) of said connector (8). 
Transport means according to claim 1, wherein said edge (17) is disposed on 
said first clamping portions (11) and extends parallel to said first axis (A1). 
Transport means according to one of the preceding claims 1 and 2, wherein 
each connector (8) on each side of said first and second clamping portions (11, 

12), is provided with a respective flange (14), and wherein said tightening 
means are formed by bolts that engage said flanges and wherein said flanges 

(14) preferably are provided on the side of the first clamping portion (11) 
opposite the connecting means (18, 19). 
Transport means according to one the preceding claims 1 to 3, wherein said 
lengths of a profiled member have a circular outer cross-sectional configuration, 

preferably being lengths of a tubular profiled member.  
 
Transport means according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 4, wherein for 
connections that are to transmit vertical loads, said first axis (A1) of a connector 

(8) at that location extends at least essentially horizontally, and said second axis 
(A2) of said connector (8) extends at least essentially vertically, and wherein an 

end of said second length of a profiled member about which extend said second 
clamping portions (12) rests against said first length of a profiled member about 

which extend said first clamping portions (11). 
Transport means according to claim 1 to 5, wherein said at least one connector 
(8) engages said transverse member (6, 6a, 6d, 6e) between two mounting 

plates (5) via which said transverse member is held on at least one element of 
said frame (2, 2a, 2d). 
Transport means according to the preceding claims 1 to 6, wherein said at least 
one connector (8) engages an extension (22) of said transverse member (6b, 

6d) that projects to the side beyond a mounting plate (5) via which said transverse 
member is connected to at least one element of said frame (2b, 2d). 
Transport means according to the preceding claims 1 to 7, wherein a said base 
portion (4) is provided with at least one vertical base element (9) that is formed 

from a length of a profiled member. 
Transport means according to the preceding claims 1 to 8, wherein said base 
portion (4a - 4g) is provided with at least two vertical base elements (9, 9', 9'', 

9
), each of which comprises a length of a profiled member, and is furthermore 
provided with a further element that is also formed from a length of a profiled 

member and connects said at least two base elements (9 - 9'''), and wherein 
further connectors (8) are provided for effecting said connections between said 

further element and said base elements (9-9'''). 
Transport means according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 9, wherein a 
plurality of transport elements are secured to said base portion (4c, 4e, 4f, 4g) at 

the same and/or at different levels. 
Transport means according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 10, wherein said 
base portions (4a - 4g) comprise a plurality of lengths of a profiled member, and 

wherein all connections between two lengths of a profiled member that vertically 
follow one another are formed by respective connectors (8).  

 
Transport means according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 11, wherein said 
lengths of a profiled member are at least partially provided with attachment flanges 

(7), wherein at least said lengths of a profiled member that form said transverse 
member (6 - 6d) of said frame (2 - 2d) are respectively provided with an
