<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel dichroic azo dye, a
liquid crystal composition containing the same, and a liquid
crystal element using the liquid crystal composition.Various liquid crystal display modes as well as a TN
(twisted nematic) mode and an STN (super twisted nematic)
mode have hitherto been proposed. In particular, a GH
(guest-host) display system in which a dichroic dye is used
in a dissolved state has been spreading as a display panel in
automobiles, and the like with its wide angle of vision being
taken advantage of.Dichroic dyes to be used in a GH mode are required to
have excellent dichroism, solubility in liquid crystal
compounds, light resistance, and coloring power.Azo dyes having a biphenyl skeleton exhibit a high
absorption coefficient (coloring power). They can be
prepared at low cost because an azo structure can be
introduced on each side of the biphenyl skeleton
simultaneously. Further, azo dyes having a long molecular
length sufficient for use as a dye for liquid crystals can be
obtained with ease. Despite these advantages, these azo dyes
have been limited in both production and application due to 
high toxicity (carcinogenicity and mutagenicity) of the
starting benzidine compounds.US-A-4,610,803 discloses various dichroic dyes
having an azo group on each side of a biphenyl skeleton, but
neither does it have mention of specific examples of dyes
synthesized from 2,2'-ditrifluoromethylbenzidine used in the
present invention nor does it refer to safety in production
of such dyes. Moreover, although the above patent covers
over a broad range of compounds, the specific examples shown
are limited to those dyes synthesized by using phenolic
coupling components without revealing the characteristics,
e.g., dichroism, of dichroic dyes obtained by using
alkylaniline type coupling components, which are typical
coupling components other than the phenolic ones.An object of the present invention is to provide a
dichroic dye which exhibits excellent dichroism and which can
be prepared with safety.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a liquid crystal composition containing the above dichroic
dye.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a liquid crystal element using the above liquid
crystal composition.These objects have been achieved by the
surprising finding that 2,2'-ditrifluoromethylbenzidine 
has no carcinogenicity or
mutagenicity unlike the other benzidine compounds and that a
novel azo dye having excellent dichroism can be obtained
safely where starting
