<ABSTRACT>
A steering assembly (10) for turning steerable
wheels of a vehicle in response to rotation of a steering

wheel (12) includes a pinion (30). A steering
member (14) is movable axially to effect turning movement

of the steerable wheels of the vehicle. The steering
member (14) has a rack portion (34) for engagement with

the pinion (30) and an externally threaded screw
portion (38). An electric motor (50) includes a

rotor (132) drivingly connected to the steering
member (14) and a stator (70). The stator (70) when

energized effects movement of the rotor (132) and,
thereby, rotation of the steering member (14). An

electronic control unit (210) for helping to control
operation of the electric motor (50) comprises at least

one heat-generating component (220). A one-piece cast
metal member (60) made of a homogeneous material has a

main body portion (66) encapsulating and supporting the
stator (70) and has an electronic control unit housing

portion (102). The electronic control unit housing
portion (102) of the one-piece metal member (60) includes

a platform (94). The heat-generating component (220) is
fastened to the platform (94) in a thermally conductive

relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle power assist steering system. In particular, the present invention relates to an electric power assist steering system which includes an electric assist motor for applying force to a steering member, such as a rack.A known type of vehicle power assist steering system includes a ball nut for transmitting force between a steering member and an electric assist motor. The steering system also includes an electronic control unit, or ECU, for controlling operation of the electric motor. Upon actuation of the electric motor, the ball nut is driven to rotate relative to the steering member. The rotational force of the ball nut is transmitted to the steering member to drive the steering member axially. Axial movement of the steering member effects turning movement of the steerable wheels of the vehicle.The housing of the assist motor is typically machined from steel. The process of machining the housing is difficult and costly.Attention is drawn to US5257828A which discloses a steering assembly for turning steerable wheels of a vehicle in response to rotation of a steering wheel of the vehicle, said steering assembly comprising:
a pinion;a steering member which is movable axially to effect turning movement of the steerable wheels of the vehicle, said steering member having a rack portion extending in a longitudinal direction for engagement with said pinion and an externally threaded screw portion, the steering member being movable in said longitudinal direction;an electric motor comprising a rotor drivingly connected to said steering member and a stator, said stator being arranged along said longitudinal direction of said rack portion, said stator, when energized, effecting rotation of said rotor and, thereby, movement of said steering member, said rotor being rotatable about an axis parallel to said longitudinal direction; andan electronic control unit for controlling operation of said electric motor.Further, DE 196 46 617 A1 describes a coolant pump in which a pole chamber is provided within a heat conducting metal housing in which the pole system having motor windings, winding cores and a yoke is radially, axially and rotationally fixed. The motor windings are connected via connection lines with a circuit board which is disposed in a side chamber of the metal housing in a heat conducting fashion with a housing wall.According to the invention a steering assembly as set forth in claim 1 is provided. Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims.The
