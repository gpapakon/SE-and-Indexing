<ABSTRACT>
A fat product containing milk fat with a reduced fat content is produced by mixing cream with a fat content of 40-80 % with a desired amount of water phase containing stabilizing means and salt. The temperature is kept between 50-80  C during the mixing operation. The obtained mixture, an oil-in-water emulsion, is cooled and worked in such a way that phase reversal takes place. A partial stream of phase reversed product, now a water-in-oil emulsion, is returned to the inlet of a first cooling step and is mixed with the starting mixture. The obtained end product consists of a stable water-in-oil emulsion. The product only contains milk fat and has a fat content of 25-60 %. It contains only emulsifiers naturally occurring in the cream and has a casein content below 2 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of producing a fat product with a reduced fat contentThe present invention relates to a method of producing a fat product containing milk fat with a reduced fat content.The interest in fat products based on milk fat or mixtures of milk fat and vegetable oil is rising. Hitherto one has often started with butter oil possibly mixed with vegetable oil into which fat mixture a water phase is admixed. The water phase may contain casein or caseinate, skim milk powder or milk protein, whey protein and possibly gelatin.The content of dry solids in the water phase which is mixed with the fat phase has been high in order to bind the water in a sufficient high degree so that the end product, a water-in-oil-emulsion shall be stable and not give off free water.Processes for production of products with a low fat content starting from butter, have also been presented, in which a water phase is mixed into earlier produced butter. Such processes are described for example in WO 91/07098 and in EP 368805.During recent times patent applications have been published which describe processes where products containing milk fat are produced starting from cream without any churning step. In EP 376407 there is described a process for producing a fat product from water, melted vegetable oils and cream. Similar processes are also described in EP 385542 and EP 445857. In order to obtain stable emulsions, emulsifiers areSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 added to the mixture of cream, vegetable fat and water prior to the phase reversal.When producing fat products containing only milk fat starting from cream there is sometimes a problem to obtain the desired phase reversal from the oil-in-water emulsion, the cream, to the desired water-in-oil emulsion which is the desired state for the fat product. These problems are more accentuated when the fat content of the fat mixture is low.The present invention relates to a method to obtain a satisfactory and stable phase reversal when producing a fat product only containing milk fat.The method according to the invention is mainly charac¬ terized in that cream with a fat content of 40-80 % is mixed with a desired amount of water phase containing stabilizing means, preferably gelatin, salt and aroma substances. The temperature during the mixing step is kept between 50-80°C. After the mixing operation the mixture, an oil-in-water emulsion, is cooled and worked such that phase reversal takes place. A partial stream of phase reversed product, now a water-in-oil emulsion, is returned to the inlet of a first

Claims
1. Method of producing a fat product with a reduced fat content containing milk fat, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that cream with a fat content of 40-80 % is mixed with a desired amount of water phase containing stabilizing means and salt, at which the temperature during the mixing operation is kept between 50-80°C, after which the obtained mixture, an oil-in-water emulsion, is cooled and worked in such a way that phase reversal takes place, at which a partial stream of phase reversed product, now a water-in-oil emulsion, is returned to the inlet of a first cooling step and mixed with the starting mixture and that the obtained end product consists of a stable water-in-oil-emulsion, which product only contains milk fat and has a fat content of 25-60% and only contains emulsifiers naturally occuring in the cream and has a casein content below 2 %.
2. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e - r i z e d i n that 5-50 %, preferably 5-25 % of the amount of phase reversed product is returned to the inlet of the first cooling step.
3. Method according to claim 1-2, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d i n that wholly or partly phase reversed product from a first or a second working step is returned to the inlet of the first cooling step.
