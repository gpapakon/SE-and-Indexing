<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for detecting an irregular state in a non-invasive pulse 
oximeter system comprises an oxygen saturation sensing probe generating 

spectrophotometric signals and an oxygen saturation computing section for 
deriving the arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation from the 

spectrophotometric signals. 
Irregular states of the system are detected by pre-defining at least one 
criterion for distinguishing between spectrophotometric signal indicative 

of the normal state of the system and spectrophotometric signals generated 
by the pulse oximeter system when a predetermined non-physiological event 

occurs. Then it is judged whether the actual spectrophotometric signals 
fulfil this criterion. The presence of the irregular state is detected if 

the actual criterions fulfil the criterion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a non-invasive system for monitoring 
the arterial oxygen saturation and more particularly to a method of 
detecting an irregular state in a non-invasive pulse oximeter system and 
to a method of suppressing a pulse alarm caused by a non-physiological 
event in a non-invasive pulse oximeter system for measuring the arterial 
hemoglobin oxygen saturation. Nowadays, the hemoglobin oxygen saturation of arterial blood is often 
measured with a non-invasive technique, which is called pulse oximetry. 
Pulse oximeters measure the arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin 
using two different monochromatic light sources, which are typically 
formed by LEDs, one of them emitting light in the red wavelength range 
of about 645 nm, the other one emitting light in the infrared wavelength 
range of 940 nm. The light emitted by both LEDs is transmitted through 
a predetermined area of the patient's body. Typically, pulse oximeter 
systems utilize an oxygen saturation sensing probe which is arranged to 
be secured to the patient's finger. Usually, the probe has the form of a 
clip including both light emitting diodes and a light detector. The probe 
is arranged such that the light of both light emitting diodes having passed 
the predetermined area of the patient's body is received by a single light 
detector. As it is known in the art of pulse oximetry, the light of both 
light sources is attenuated by static and dynamic adsorbers on its path 
through the patient's body to the light detector. The arterial blood whose 
quantity varies with the time synchronously with the patient's heartbeat 
represents the only dynamic adsorber during the pulse period. All other 
adsorbers, such as skin, tissue or bone, are not time-variant. As 
mentioned earlier, the light detector, which may have the form of a  
 
photodiode, receives the modulated light intensities of each wavelenght. 
Then, these signals are amplified, low pass filtered, converted from analog 
to digital and further processed in a microprocessor system. A pulse 
finding algorithm analyses the received signals, which are so-called 
spectrophotometric signals for identifying the pulses and for determining 
the pulse. After identifying the pulse period, the microprocessor system 
determines the diastolic and systolic values of the spectrophotometric 
signals and derives therefrom the so-called relative absorption ratios. 
Subsequently, the microprocessor system computes the arterial oxygen 
saturation from the relative absorption
