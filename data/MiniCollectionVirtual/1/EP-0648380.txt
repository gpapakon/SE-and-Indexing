<ABSTRACT>
A battery has an exposed negative terminal (2), but the positive terminal (10) is hidden within the casing of the battery and instead only a dummy terminal (3) is visible. When the vehicle is parked, power is fed from the positive terminal (10) through an isolator relay (12) to an INHIBIT circuit (C). When power is made available through the ignition switch to a terminal (6) power is fed via a socket (4) to a keypad. A predetermined code has to be set into the keypad in order to pass an operating signal to an electronic lock (13) which is effective to switch the relay (12) to connect power to an ENABLE circuit (B) and to disconnect the supply from the INHIBIT circuit (C). This causes a solenoid (9) to operate for a time determined by a timer (14) so that the positive terminal (10) is connected to the dummy terminal (3) through a plunger (9A). When the ignition key is moved to the start position power is supplied through the starter lead connected from the terminal (3) to a starter motor. Consequently, the motor cannot normally be started unless the ignition sequence includes the keying in of the code into the keypad. Any attempt to bypass the ignition system or bump-start the car will result in sensing devices (15 or 19) opening switch contacts (18A) supplying power to the alternator via the terminal (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
It is well known that most motor vehicles are started 
by means of a starter motor, and an ignition spark where 
applicable. The power source for starting is usually 
provided by the starter battery contained in the vehicle. 
The battery can be switched in and out of circuit by an 
ignition switch operated by a key. This system is however very poor in terms of security 
of the vehicle. A thief can use jump-leads to bypass the 
ignition switch to enable him to steal a vehicle quite 
easily, and this fact is confirmed by the enormous number of 
vehicle thefts each year. There is obviously a requirement 
for an immobiliser which will prevent vehicle theft by this 
means. According to the present invention there is provided a 
starter battery for an automotive vehicle, the battery 
having the usual negative and positive terminals but 
incorporating a control circuit sealed within the battery, 
including a heavy duty switch between the positive terminal 
and a dummy terminal, the positive terminal being inaccessible 
from the exterior of the battery whilst the negative 
terminal and the dummy terminal are accessible from the 
exterior of the battery as terminal posts for connection to 
the starter motor of the vehicle, the control circuit having 
an input for connection to an external code-controlled 
operating device for controlling the enabling of said heavy 
duty switch.  
 Thus the battery has a built-in capability to make the 
positive terminal of the battery open-circuit. The battery 
appears to have the usual two main terminal posts (positive 
and negative) as in a conventional battery. One terminal 
post which is visible is in effect a dummy terminal and is 
normally open-circuit, but can be joined by the heavy duty 
switch within the body of the battery to the real positive 
terminal, which is hidden under the lid of the battery and 
is not accessible. During the construction of the battery a tamper-proof 
screen (for example of metal, bullet-proof glass or other 
suitable material) may be built into the lid of the battery, 
such that when the lid is finally welded onto the battery 
main body, the screen is positioned in such a way that it 
prevents tampering with the heavy duty switch, the real 
positive terminal or the control circuit. This screen (if 
formed from an electrically-conductive material) could also 
be connected electrically to the main negative terminal 
post. The main negative terminal post is also constructed in 
such a way that it can be connected electrically within the 
lid of

A starter battery for an automotive vehicle, the 
battery having the usual negative and positive terminals but 

incorporating a control circuit sealed within the battery, 
including a heavy duty switch between the positive terminal 

and a dummy terminal, the positive terminal being inaccessible 
from the exterior of the battery whilst the negative 

terminal and the dummy terminal are accessible from the 
exterior of the battery as terminal posts for connection to 

the starter motor of the vehicle, the control circuit having 
an input for connection to an external code-controlled 

operating device for controlling the enabling of said heavy 
duty switch. 
A starter battery according to Claim 1, wherein the 
positive terminal is connected through a switching device to 

an inhibit circuit having a switch-controlled output for 
connection to the starter motor solenoid of the vehicle and 

possibly to other electrically-operated parts of the 
vehicle. 
A starter battery according to Claim 2, wherein 
said switch-controlled output comprises a normally-closed 

switch and a control device for changing the status of that 
switch upon receipt of a signal indicating an attempt to 

start the vehicle. 
A starter battery according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, wherein said heavy duty switch is fed from a timer 

which allows the heavy duty switch to be enabled only for a 
predetermined time interval.  

 
A starter battery according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, wherein the heavy duty switch is in the form of a 

solenoid. 
A starter battery according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, wherein the code-controlled operating device is a 

handset or panel with a keypad enabling a digital code to be 
entered. 
A starter battery according to Claim 6, wherein the 
digital code provides a predetermined PIN number for 

enabling the control circuit of the battery. 
A starter battery according to Claim 6 or Claim 7, 
wherein the handset or panel carries operating lights for 

indicating the status of the control circuit. 
A starter battery according to any one of Claims 1 
to 8, wherein a tamper-proof screen is installed within the 

battery body and over the control circuit and the positive 
terminal. 
A starter battery according to Claim 9, wherein 
the screen is formed from an electrically-conductive 

material and is connected to the negative terminal of the 
battery. 
A starter battery according to any one of Claims 
1 to 10, wherein the control circuit incorporates a 

microphone, trembler switch or other device for sensing 
attempts to start a vehicle and connected to inhibit the 

starting of the vehicle.
