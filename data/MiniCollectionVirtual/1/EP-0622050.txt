<ABSTRACT>
A microsurgical scalpel assembly including an elongate scalpel 
handle (22) and a scalpel blade (26) affixed at one end of the scalpel 

handle 
and a shield (24) releasably affixed to the one end of the scalpel 

handle and extending away from the handle to operably surround the 
scalpel blade to isolate sharp surfaces of the scalpel blade from 

a surgeon and to protect the blade from damage during a re-sterilization 
autoclave procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a microsurgical scalpel assembly 
according to the preamble of claim 1. 
More particularly this invention is directed to a microsurgical 
scalpel assembly with enhanced safety and useability 
characteristics for an operating surgeon and a concomitant 
capability of being economically utilized as a high precision 
instrument. In the surgical scalpel industry and particularly the 
microsurgical scalpel arena at least two problems are becoming of 
increasing concern. One level of concern surrounds the economic 
utilization of surgical instruments in the medical community. In 
this connection, low cost scalpels have been envisioned which are 
essentially disposable, however, initial point sharpness and 
cutting edge quality less than at which exists in more expensive, 
high precision instruments. However, with increasing economic 
pressures being placed upon the medical community, tradeoffs are 
being seriously evaluated and low cost disposable scalpels are 
being utilized as opposed to more high quality precision 
instruments. In addition to instrument quality and an attendant potential 
for less than optimum surgical results the medical community has a 
growing concern with respect to body fluid transmitted diseases. 
In this, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Hepatitis B, 
etc., are becoming prevalent enough such that health care 
professionals are increasingly concerned about maintaining an 
uncompromising isolation integrity with respect to the body fluid  
 
of patients. Although wearing disposable rubber gloves is a 
precaution of preference, and even in certain instances wearing 
double gloves is an accepted practice, when utilizing a sharply 
pointed and/or sharp bladed surgical instrument such as 
microsurgical scalpels, puncture wounds, even though a double 
gloved surgeon, is not only conceivable but almost inescapable. It 
has been estimated that as much as two percent of sharp product 
handling results in accidental stabs in the medical community. The difficulty suggested in the proceeding are not intended to 
be exhaustive but rather are among many which may tend to limit the 
effectiveness of prior microsurgical scalpels. Other noteworthy 
problems may also exist; however, those presented above should be 
sufficient to demonstrate that microsurgical scalpels appearing in 
the past will admit to worthwhile improvement. The US-A-4,735,202 which discloses the features of the preamble of 
claim 1, shows a disposable micro-surgical knife 
having a blade guard
