<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fire control 
radar systems, and particularly to a conversion kit for 
upgrading an existing fire control radar system designed to 
control gun batteries with respect to incoming targets and 
also to track and guide missiles towards incoming targets. Fire control radar systems for controlling gun 
batteries with respect to incoming targets have been in 
extensive use for a considerable period of time. Also known 
are fire control radar systems for controlling missiles, in 
which the missile includes a beacon transmitter transmitting 
a beacon signal to a receiver in the fire control radar 
system to aid the system in tracking and guiding the missile 
to the target. While the first system has low probability 
of kill with respect to the second, the second one is very 
expensive due to the cost of the missiles battery and to the 
additional fire control radar to track the missile in its 
trajectory towards the target. An object of the present invention is to provide 
an arrangement for enhancing an existing fire control radar 
system designed to control gun batteries also to control 
missiles, which arrangement involves a small fraction of the 
cost that normally be required in providing a separate fire 
control radar system for missiles. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a conversion kit for upgrading an existing fire 
control radar system having a target radar antenna for  
 
tracking a target to enable the system also to track, with 
respect to the target, a missile having a beacon 
transmitter, the conversion kit comprising: missile antenna 
means for measuring and commanding the missile; means for 
attaching the missile antenna means to the target radar 
antenna of the fire control radar system; a command 
transmitter for transmitting command signals via the missile 
antenna means to a missile; a beacon receiver for receiving 
from the missile, via the missile antenna means, response 
signals from the missile beacon transmitter in response to 
the reception by the missile of the command signals; and a 
guidance computer for utilizing the command signals 
transmitted by the command transmitter, and the response 
signals received from the missile beacon transmitter, and 
tracking signals received from the fire control radar 
system, for measuring the missile's trajectory and for 
guiding the same to the target. According to further features in the preferred 
embodiment of the invention described below, the kit further 
includes means for generating
