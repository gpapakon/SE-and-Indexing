<ABSTRACT>
A dual pulse flashlamp-pumped laser system (50) having 
a power supply circuit (62) which not only charges two 

capacitors (C1, C2) which are successively discharged to 
produce two laser pulses, but also supplies a simmer 

current through the flashlamp (58) between the pulses. The 
first laser pulse follows a trigger pulse on a flashlamp 

trigger wire (60) which ionizes the flashlamp gas, permitting 
a first capacitor (C1) to discharge through the flashlamp 

(58). The simmer current maintains the flashlamp gas 
in an ionized state, so that a second trigger pulse is not 

needed. The second laser pulse follows an SCR-controlled 
discharge of the second capacitor (C2) through the flashlamp 

(58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to flashlamp pumped dye lasers, 
and more particularly to a power supply configuration to 
achieving double pulsed operation. Flashlamp pumped dye lasers are a well known class of 
lasers. The flashlamp pumped dye laser includes a charge 
power supply to charge a capacitor which is discharged in 
order to create the pulse needed to provide pulsed laser 
operation. The power supply conventionally provides a 
single pulse, there being a relatively long time interval 
required in order to provide another pulse. There are, however, some application which require a 
pair of closely occurring laser pulses. One such application 
is that of Laser Identification of Friend or Foe 
(IFF). This application requires two laser pulses spaced 
apart by a minimum of 50 milliseconds to a maximum of 125 
milliseconds. Simple modification of the conventional 
charge power supply, e.g., to charge two capacitors, then 
discharge the capacitors with a time interval between them 
to provide two pulses, does not solve the problem. For 
example, the capacitors would be charged with the power 
supply, and the laser fired by discharging the first 
capacitor with the usual high voltage trigger pulse on the 
flashlamp. After delaying to separate the pulses, the  
 
laser could be fired again by somehow discharging the 
second capacitor through some combination of SCR and the 
high voltage trigger pulse on the flashlamp. The problem 
with triggering the second pulse is that if the power 
supply is used only in the conventional manner to charge 
the capacitors, the SCR would have to be triggered at 
exactly the same time as when the high voltage trigger 
pulse ionizes the gas in the flashlamp. This would create 
a very difficult timing problem between triggering the SCR 
and the high voltage trigger pulse ionizing the gas in the 
flashlamp. A further disadvantage is that a flashlamp 
trigger pulse is required to produce each laser pulse, 
since the flashlamp life is very dependent on the number of 
high voltage trigger pulses which have been applied. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide 
a double pulsed flashlamp pumped dye laser. A further object is to provide a double pulsed flashlamp 
pumped laser which requires only a single flashlamp 
trigger in order to obtain the two closely spaced pulses. A dual pulse flashlamp-pumped laser system is disclosed, 
and includes laser cavity-defining means with laser 
material disposed therein, and a flashlamp for providing 
pump light to excite laser
