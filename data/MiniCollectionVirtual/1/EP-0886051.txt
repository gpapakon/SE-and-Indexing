<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine comprising: a piston (2) and a cylinder (3), the
piston (2) being sealedly mounted to the cylinder (3) and being reciprocally

mobile therein between a Top Dead Centre (TDC) and a Bottom Dead Centre
(BDC); also comprising a combustion chamber (4) delimited by the piston (2)

and the cylinder (3); a crankshaft (5) provided with a crank (5m) pin (5p); a
connecting rod (6) having a small end (6p) rotatably connected to the piston (2)

and a big end (6t) rotatably connected to the pin (5p) of the crank (5m) of the
crank shaft (5), also comprising at least one cam (7), mounted, rotatably and

freely mobile on the big end (6t) of the connecting rod (6) and on the pin (5p)
of the crank (5m), which cam (7) by effect of inertia consequent to a rotation of

the crank (5m), moves cyclically rotatingly with respect to the pin (5p) and the
connecting rod (6) between two operative positions, in which it transmits to the

connecting rod (6) an action which adds to the inertia actions of the connecting
rod (6) and the piston (2), and which in correspondence with reaching Top

Dead Centre enables a rapid displacement (70) of the connecting rod (6)-crank
(5m) assembly towards the Bottom Dead Centre, so as to prevent a series of

conditions from occurring in the combustion chamber (4) which would lead to
detonation of a fuel-air mixture due to an effect of an overpressure generated in

said combustion chamber (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reciprocating internal combustion engine with
mechanical regulation for controlling and inhibiting detonation, in particular
for achieving high pressures. In relation to the performance offered, the engine
also provides lower consumption, greater power, better torque and a lower
quantity of unburnt waste substances and toxic gases.Reciprocating internal combustion engines are thermal motors converting the
greatest possible portion of energy released by burning fuel within the engine
itself into mechanical work.The working fluid, which exchanges energy with the mobile engine organs
through a process of expansion and compression, is constituted by a mixture of
air and fuel before combustion and by products of the fuel oxidation in air after
combustion.By virtue of their simplicity, compactness and high power-to-weight ratio,
these engines have been swiftly adapted for use in propelling vehicles, both
land and water-borne, and even in some cases, air-borne; they have also been
used for the generation of power in fixed and self-propelling work machines. Reciprocating engines, as is well known, are generally provided with at least
one piston which is sealedly and slidably mounted in a cylinder, in which the
piston is reciprocable between a top dead centre and a bottom dead centre. The
piston and the cylinder define in combination a combustion chamber,
comprised between the upper end of the cylinder and a mobile wall - i.e. the
upper surface of the piston - in which chamber, after the formation of the air-fuel
mixture, an ignition takes place, causing combustion, expansion and
discharge of the resulting exhaust gases.There are two types of cycles which follow the above-described operative
process: namely, the Diesel cycle and the Otto cycle.The engines carrying out one type of cycle and the engines carrying out the
other type of cycle are considerably different in terms of functional
characteristics and performance, which makes each preferable to the other in
differing fields of use.In particular, internal combustion engines of the Otto cycle type have a
controlled ignition. In these engines, a petrol vapour-air mixture (though other
lightweight fuel types can be used, liquid and/or gas) is ignited by a spark
produced between the electrodes of a spark plug, leading to a very fast
combustion (ideally at constant volume).Diesel-cycle engines, on the other hand, have spontaneous ignition. Finely-atomised
fuel is injected into compressed hot air, so as to cause self-ignition
and give

A reciprocating internal combustion engine comprising: a piston (2) and
a cylinder (3), the piston (2) being internally slidably and sealedly mounted to

the cylinder (3) and being reciprocally mobile between two dead centre points,
