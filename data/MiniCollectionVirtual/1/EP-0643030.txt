Process for isolating m-dichlorobenzene from mixtures 
of dichlorobenzene isomers by crystallization 

as eutectic crystals using a processing aid, characterized 
in that the processing aid used is a compound 

of the formula (I) 

 
in which 


R
1
 to R
6
are, independently of one another, hydrogen, 
halogen, C
1
-C
4
-alkyl, hydroxyl, NH
2
 
or R-CO- having R = C
1
-C
4
-alkyl, 
 
with 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene and 1,4-dibromobenzene 

being excepted. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
in formula (I) at least 2 of the radicals R
1
 to R
6
 
are hydrogen and up to 4 of these radicals are 

chlorine or C
1
-C
4
-alkyl, with 1,4-dibromobenzene 
being excepted. 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that tetrachlorobenzenes or cresols are used as 

processing aids.  
 
Process according to Claims 1 - 3, characterized in 
that from 20 to 200 parts by weight of a processing 

aid are used per 100 parts by weight of mixture of 
dichlorobenzene isomers. 
Process according to Claims 1 - 4, characterized in 
that the mixtures of dichlorobenzene isomers used 

are ones containing 80 - 86 % by weight of m-DCB, 
14 - 20 % by weight of p-DCB and optionally up to 

2 % by weight of other materials. 
Process according to Claims 1 - 5, characterized in 
that the crystallization temperature is below +20°C. 
Process according to Claims 1 - 6, characterized in 
that the crystallization temperature is in the range 

from -10°C to +15°C. 
Process according to Claims 1 - 7, characterized in 

that, after crystallization, the mother liquor is 
collected and the molten eutectic crystals are 

collected separately therefrom. 
Process according to Claims 1 - 8, characterized in 
that the processing aid used is separated off from 

the mother liquor and the molten mixture of the 
eutectic crystals by distillation and is 

recirculated to the process of the invention. 
Process according to Claims 8 and 9, characterized 
in that the proportions of dichlorobenzene present 

in the mother liquor and the molten eutectic crystals 
are separated therefrom, with the mother liquor 

giving an m-/p-dichlorobenzene mixture which is 
again fed to the process of the invention and the 

molten eutectic crystals giving m-dichlorobenzene 
having a purity of above 90 % by weight.
