<ABSTRACT>
A method for monitoring and maintaining correct regulation of the 
tension of a yarn (1) fed to a textile machine (T), such as a 

loom, a hosiery machine or a knitting machine, comprises 
continuously determining both the state of movement and the 

tension of the yarn (1) at a point between the usual bobbin (2) 
from which the yarn is unwound and the textile machine (T) which 

processes it, then comparing the measured tension with a preset 
desired tension and adjusting said tension of the yarn (1) at a 

point between the bobbin (2) and the point in which the said 
tension is measured, said adjustment being interrupted when the 

measured tension is equal to the desired value. 
A device for implementing the aforesaid method comprises tension 
sensing means connected to means for comparing the measured value 

with a desired tension, said comparison means cooperating with 
means for controlling braking means acting on the yarn so as to 

vary its tension in the desired manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for monitoring the tension of a
yarn fed to a textile machine and for regulating it in such a
manner as to maintain it constant, ie equal to a predetermined
tension, said yarn being unwound from a usual support such as a
bobbin or the like and being fed to said machine, such as a usual
loom, a hosiery machine or a knitting machine.The invention also relates to a device for implementing said
method.Methods and devices are already known for varying the tension of
yarn fed to a textile machine in accordance with particular
processing stages of the machine or particular requirements of the
user.A known tensioning device (such as the device disclosed, for example, by DE-A-3 734 471) comprises for example two opposing disc
elements which are pressed together and against an interposed yarn
by a helical spring; the action of this latter on the discs is
adjusted by a knob which is screwed onto a threaded rod to vary
the pressure exerted by the discs on the yarn. In this manner the
yarn is braked and its tension varied.Another known device (such as the device disclosed, for example, by DE-A-3 734 471) comprises a series of fixed pins arranged in
such a manner as to compel the yarn to travel over them and
undergo a zig-zag path enabling the yarn to be braked or
tensioned; by varying the relative spatial position of said pins 
the path angles can be varied discretely, so adjusting the tension
applied to said yarn.These devices and their adjustment methods, together with other
known devices and methods, enable the yarn to undergo the required
tensioning or braking.This tension varies during the use of the yarn even if it
originates from a single support member or bobbin. In this
respect, the yarn of each bobbin has a starting tension or braking
which varies depending on the yarn colour, its type, its
lubrication and the relative humidity of the environment in which
the yarn is processed, but in particular on the bobbin diameter.
The yarn bobbin diameter is known to gradually decrease as the
yarn is unwound from the bobbin. Hence the rotational speed under
which the yarn is unwound increases in a manner inversely
proportional to the bobbin diameter, this increasing the yarn
tension. In addition, if the speed of the textile machine
increases there is a proportional increase in the tension applied
to the yarn.The aforesaid known devices are unable to independently compensate
for the continuous variation in the tension of the yarn during its
use in the production of an article.All this
