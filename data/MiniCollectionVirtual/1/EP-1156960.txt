<ABSTRACT>
An autonomous stratospheric airship (10) comprising a hull (20) which contains an equipment bay (30), forward and aft ballonets (40 and 50), forward and aft air management sub-systems (60 and 70), a propulsion system (80), and a control system (390) is described. The airship (10) also comprises a regenerative solar energy power (650) and storage subsystem (350) which allows powered daytime and nighttime operations. Further, the control system (390) of the airship (10) enables autonomous operation between selected waypoints or along a specified line of sight. The solar arrays (340) utilized by the airship (10) are internally mounted and gimballed so as to provide maximum collection efficiency and not impede the aerodynamic profile of the airship (10). A greatly simplified and slightly less controllable version of the airship, which makes use of alternative solar array control (912) and ballast management systems (930), while carrying the equipment bay (30) on the exterior of the hull (20), is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of lighter-than-air
type craft and, more particularly, to an autonomous
stratospheric airship having a neutrally buoyant structure at
flight altitude, making use of regenerative electric energy
storage and collection. This application claims the benefit of
U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 60/111,835, filed on
December 11, 1998 and U.S. Utility Patent Application Number
09/247,878, filed on February 15, 1999.In the past, there have been designed and used a series of
dirigibles, other types of lighter-than-air vehicles, hot-air
balloons, and so forth, for passenger transport, rescue work,
lift capabilities, and transport of goods and supplies. The
present invention relates to a powered airship having a buoyant
structure designed specifically for operations in the
stratosphere. It incorporates an autonomous navigation
capability and a regenerative solar electric energy collection
and storage system, enabling the airship to remain aloft for
extended periods of time, while following a specified course
and gathering mission-specific data.The prior art reveals several attempts at providing a
portion of the capabilities embodied in the present invention,
but none was found to incorporate all of the capabilities
mentioned below and each such attempt tends to utilize rather
complicated mechanical structures. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,333,817
and 5,538,203 both disclose a buoyancy adjustment system for a
lighter-than-air vehicle, involving a series of ballonets, each
arranged along the longitudinal axis of the airship in equal
numbers. The object of these inventions is to provide a system
of independent control for ballonet inflation/deflation which
dispenses with ducted coupling to the individual ballonets. In 
addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,538,203 provides rapid deflation of
the same ballonet system, instead of merely venting it to the
atmosphere. In either case, this system is rather primitive
and does not take into account the differential pressure
between the atmosphere, the surrounding airship gas bag, and
the pressure within individual ballonets.U.S. Patent No. 5,348,254, issued to Nakada, claims an
airship design for flights of long duration powered by solar
cell batteries and a hydrogen generation system. This system
obviates the need for batteries by electrolytic generation of
hydrogen; however, accidental puncture of the hydrogen storage
envelope can easily result in complete destruction of the
airship.U.S. Patent No. 4,995,572, issued to Piasecki, describes
a
