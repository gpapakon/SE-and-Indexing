<ABSTRACT>
The firing and/or casting kiln has a containment 
casing which internally forms a treatment chamber (3), a 

part holder (27) which is movably mounted inside the 
treatment chamber (3), an opening (19a) for access to the 

treatment chamber (3), and a conditioning system (37, 39, 
41, 42) for producing a vacuum and introducing inert gas 

into the treatment chamber (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kiln for firing or
casting prosthodontic products.In the manufacture of dental prostheses, false teeth
made of ceramic material, supported on a core or support
constituted by a titanium casting, are becoming
increasingly widespread. The stable coupling between the
ceramic material and the titanium support is achieved by
firing the ceramic material on the metal support. In order
to avoid the formation of oxides on the surface of the
metal support, which would compromise the metallic
structure and thus the adhesion and anchorage of the
ceramic material, firing must occur in an inert atmosphere.The kilns that have been used so far allow firing in
an inert atmosphere, but the operator, after removing the
part from the muffle, must wait for a long time (a few
hours) before he can continue with the necessary work for
finishing the prosthesis, since it is necessary to wait for
the complete cooling of the prosthesis in the closed kiln;
the productivity of a firing operation is therefore very
low.Italian patent application VR93A000012, filed February
18, 1993 in the name of the same Applicant, discloses a
process and an apparatus for casting in an inert atmosphere
which uses a crucible placed adjacent to a casting cylinder
which contains refractory material with an impression: the
crucible and the cylinder are located within a sealed
casting chamber. The casting chamber can be tilted to cast
the molten metal into the crucible by gravity. The ambient
air contained by the crucible section and by the cylinder 
section is aspirated by means of a pneumatic circuit
connected to a vacuum pump. After producing a certain
degree of vacuum, the aspiration circuit is disconnected
and inert gas is introduced from the crucible section; said
gas passes through the chamber that contains the crucible
and the casting chamber and the related impressions,
performing an effective flushing action. After casting,
inert gas at a relatively high pressure is introduced in
the chamber that contains the crucible in order to inject,
by pressure, the molten metal into the casting cylinder;
the aspiration circuit is then disconnected from the
casting chamber section as well, the unit is opened and the
casting cylinder is removed from the muffle.Such a solution according to the above mentioned
patent application, while being a considerable improvement
over the prior state of the art, is in practice affected by
some limitations that sometimes negatively affect the
quality of the products, which is not always

<CLAIMS>
Firing and/or casting kiln which comprises:

a containment casing which internally forms at least one treatment chamber
(3);
at least one part holder (21) which is movably mounted inside the, or the at
least one, respective treatment chamber (3);
a casting cylinder (33) arranged for receiving melted material from said part
holder (21);
at least one opening (19a) for access to the or each treatment chamber; and
conditioning means (41,47) for producing a vacuum and introducing inert gas
in the or each treatment chamber,

   characterized in that said treatment chamber (3) is rotatably mounted about a
horizontal axis (14) such that a pellet held by said part holder (21) arranged

vertically is melted and then said treatment chamber is rotated about said horizontal
axis (14) so that the melted pellet is poured by gravity into said casting cylinder

(33).
Kiln according to claim 1, characterized in that said treatment chamber is a
hermetically-closed casting chamber (3) which accommodates a crucible (21) and a

casting cylinder (32) which are placed mutually adjacent within the casting chamber
(3), said conditioning means comprising electric-arc heating means (25) for the

load, means for aspirating air (41), at least one source (47) for delivering inert gas,
and a discharge valve (60), said discharge valve being a safety valve meant to

control the pressure of the inert gas in the casting chamber (3) during casting. 
Kiln according to claim 2, characterized in that said casting cylinder (32)
contains refractory material (33) with an impression (34).
Kiln according to any one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in
that said conditioning means comprise means for aspirating air (41) both from the

crucible section (B) and from the cylinder section (A).
Kiln according to any one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in
that said source (47) for delivering inert gas is connected to the treatment chamber

(3) so as to supply gas to the crucible section (B).
Kiln according to any one or more of the preceding claims 2-3 and 4-5
when dependent upon claims 2 and 3, characterized in that said discharge valve (60)

is arranged downstream of the casting cylinder (32).
Process for casting one or more loads of titanium in an inert atmosphere
and under controlled pressure which comprises, in sequence:


the preparation of a metal load to be cast in a crucible (21) located adjacent to
a casting cylinder (32) with refractory and an impression, said crucible (21) and said

cylinder (32) being arranged within a sealed casting chamber (3) that can be tilted
and has electric-arc heating means (25) for said load, means for aspirating air (41)

from the crucible section (B) and from the cylinder section (A), at least one source
(47) for delivering inert gas to the crucible section (B), and a vent valve (60); 
the provision of a vacuum of at least 4 millibar within the casting chamber
(3), said vacuum being controlled by a Pirani device by aspirating from the cylinder

section (A) in order to adequately degas the refractory material (33) that delimits the
casting impression (34);
the supply of inert gas at a low pressure, on the order of approximately 0.2
bars, to "pre-flush" the casting chamber (3);
the activation of electric-arc means (25) to melt the load;
the interruption of the aspiration;
the supply of inert gas until the casting chamber (3) is saturated;
the tilting of the casting chamber (3) to cast from the crucible (21) into the
casting cylinder (32);
the supply of inert gas at a relatively high pressure to push the molten metal
so that it enters the material inside the casting cylinder (32);
the controlled external discharge of the inert gas at a threshold value that is

casting at constant and moderate pressure;
and the removal of the casting cylinder (32) from the muffle.
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the initial vacuum
before melting and casting occur is maintained for at least two minutes so as to

produce high degassing of the casting cylinder (32).
Process according to any one or more of claims 7 and 8, characterized in

Process according to any one or more of the preceding claims 7-9,
