<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a support for a planographic 
printing plate, which reduces the scattering in the material of 

the aluminum support, improves the yield of the electrolytic 
surface graining treatment, and is able to produce lithographic 

printing plates having superior surface graining aptitude. 
Aluminum material with a width of 1000mm and a thickness of 6mm 

is formed in the continuous casting twin-roller thin plate 
device. It is then cold rolled to a plate thickness of 3mm, 

and after conducting annealing at 400°C, cold rolling 
(including correction) is further conducted to bring it to 

0.3mm and form the samples. The temperature distribution of 
the molten metal at the outlet of the molten metal supply 

nozzle is kept within a predetermined range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
a support for a planographic printing plate, and, in
particular, to a method of producing an aluminum support which
is superior in an electrolytic ally graining property.Aluminum plate (including aluminum alloy plates) is
used as a printing plate support, and particularly as offset
printing plate support.Generally, in order to use an aluminum plate as an
offset printing plate support, it is necessary that the
aluminum plate has the proper degree of adhesion with
photosensitive material and moisture retention.For this purpose, the surface of the aluminum plate
must be uniformly and finely grained. Since this surface
graining treatment exercises a remarkable influence on the
printing performance and print durability of the plate material
when offset printing is actually conducted after plate
preparation, its quality is an important factor in the
manufacture of plate material.As a surface roughening method for the aluminum support
used for the printing plate, the alternating current 
electrolytic graining method is commonly used, and as the
electric current, ordinary sinewave current, or special
alternating wave form current such as square wave are used.
Surface graining treatment of the aluminum plate is conducted
by means of alternating current using a suitable electrode of
graphite, etc. as the opposite electrode, and the treatment is
usually conducted once, but the pit depth obtained in this
manner is generally shallow, and print durability has been
inferior. As a result, numerous methods have been proposed for
purposes of obtaining a suitable aluminum plate as a support
for planographic printing plate which has a grain where the
pits are uniform and fine with a depth which is deep compared
with the diameter. As conventional examples of such methods,
there is the surface graining method which uses special wave
form for electrolytic treatment (Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. Sho-53-67507), the special ratio between
electricity quantity of a positive period and that of negative
period at the time of alternating electrolytic surface graining
(Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho-54-65607),
special wave form (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.
Sho-55-25381), the combination of current density (Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho-56-29699), etc.In addition, combining with mechanical surface graining
(Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho-55-142695) is
also known. On the other hand, as the producing method
