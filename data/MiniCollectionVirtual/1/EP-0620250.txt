<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tire having a rubber 
tread which is reinforced with silica. In one aspect, 
the tread is comprised of a specified multiple 
component rubber blend reinforced with a quantitative 
amount of silica or a combination of silica and carbon 
black. Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally 
prepared with a rubber tread which can be a blend of 
various rubbers which is typically reinforced with 
carbon black. In one aspect, rubbers are evaluated, selected 
and blended for a purpose of achieving desired tire 
tread properties and particularly a balance of tire 
tread characteristic properties, mainly, rolling 
resistance, traction and wear. For various applications utilizing rubber 
including applications such as tires and particularly 
tire treads, sulfur cured rubber is utilized which 
contains substantial amounts of reinforcing filler(s). 
Carbon black is commonly used for such purpose and 
normally provides or enhances good physical properties 
for the sulfur cured rubber. Particulate silica is 
also sometimes used for such purpose, particularly 
when the silica is used in conjunction with a coupling 
agent. In some cases, a combination of silica and 
carbon black is utilized for reinforcing fillers for 
various rubber products, including treads for tires. It is important to appreciate that, 
conventionally, carbon black is considered to be a 
more effective reinforcing filler for rubber tire  
 
treads than silica if the silica is used without a 
coupling agent. Indeed, at least as compared to carbon black, 
there tends to be a lack of, or at least an 
insufficient degree of, physical and/or chemical 
bonding between the silica particles and the rubber 
elastomers to enable the silica to become a 
reinforcing filler for the rubber for most purposes, 
including tire treads, if the silica is used without a 
coupler. While various treatments and procedures have 
been devised to overcome such deficiencies, compounds 
capable of reacting with both the silica surface and 
the rubber elastomer molecule, generally known to 
those skilled in such art as coupling agents, or 
couplers, are often used. Such coupling agents, for 
example, may be premixed, or pre-reacted, with the 
silica particles or added to the rubber mix during the 
rubber/silica processing, or mixing, stage. If the 
coupling agent and silica are added separately to the 
rubber mix during the rubber/silica mixing, or 
processing stage, it is considered that the coupling 
agent then combines in situ with the silica. In
