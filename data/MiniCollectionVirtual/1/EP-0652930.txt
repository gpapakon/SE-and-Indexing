<ABSTRACT>
A granular laundry detergent composition is disclosed having a bulk density of at least 650 g/l which comprises (a) discrete particles comprising from 25 % by weight to 60 % by weight of anionic surfactant; (b) inorganic perhydrate bleach; (c) peroxyacid bleach precursor, wherein the peroxyacid bleach precursor is coated, the coating material being selected from water-soluble acidic polymers. The composition has a low tendency to form a gel upon contact with water, and minimises damage to delicate, coloured fabrics. A process for making a granular laundry detergent composition which has a low tendency to form a gel upon contact with water is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW GELLING DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS AND A PROCESS FOR MAKING SUCH COMPOSITIONSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a low gelling laundry detergent compositions having a high bulk density, and comprising a bleach and bleach activator. The composition is particularly well suited to minimise or eliminate fabric damage, especially to delicate coloured fabrics.Background of the InventionIt has long been recognised that granular powders can form undesirable gels upon contact with water (ie at the start of the wash cycle) . These gels are caused, at least in part, by the presence of highly viscous surfactant phases that may arise when the detergent comes into contact with water, either in the dispensing drawer of the washing machine, or in a dispensing device which is placed into the drum of the machine. It has also been recognised that the formation of gels has undesirable properties including poor dispensing, lower performance because of slower solubility of active agents into the wash water, and deposition of residues (ie the gel) on to fabrics. 

It has more recently been recognised that gels deposited on to fabrics early in the wash cycle can cause high local concentrations of active bleaching agents (eg. peroxide) which can cause local damage to fabrics, such as discoloration.EP510746, published on 28th October, 1992 discloses high active, low gelling surfactant particles which may be admixed with other ingredients including bleach and bleach activator in order to make a finished composition. Acid coated bleach activator particles are not disclosed.It is the aim of the invention to provide a compact, granular detergent composition comprising high active surfactant particles as well as inorganic perhydrate bleach and peroxyacid bleach precursor (or "bleach activator") , which has a very low tendency to gel thereby minimising or eliminating fabric damage. A further aim of the invention is to provide a process route for making low gelling compositions of this type.Detailed Description of the InventionCompositions of the present invention reduce or eliminate the fabric damage caused by gel sticking to fabrics and causing very high local concentration of bleaching agent. The essential components of the present invention are: a) particles comprising a high level (from 25% to 60%) of anionic surfactant; b) inorganic perhydrate bleach; c) acid coated peroxyacid bleach precursorHigh Active Surfactant Containing ParticlesA wide range of surfactants can be used in the detergent compositions.
