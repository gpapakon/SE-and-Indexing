<ABSTRACT>
The process enables partitioned box members to be manufactured, fixing them together from the outside of these box members. Two successive inclined shots of a laser beam (8A, 8B) are used, these intersecting in the region of the upper surface (1B) of the workpiece (1) forming the top of the assembly. The two laser-welding axes (8A, 8B) cut through two upper corners (2C) of the workpiece (2) forming the leg of the T. The welding device is placed on the outside of the box member, that is to say on the side of the upper surface (1B) of the top (1) of the T. Application to the manufacture of the arms of the outer channel of a turbojet.

Process for laser welding a T-shaped assembly of 
two metal workpieces (1, 3 and 2) which is accessible 

only from the side on which the head of the T lies, via 

an external surface (1B, 3B), that is to say not 
accessible via the side on which the foot of the T (2) 

lies, the process comprising the following steps: 

forming a groove (7) in the lower surface (1A, 3A) 
of the head of the T (1, 3) having a width (L) equal 

to the thickness of the foot of the T (2) and having 
a defined depth (P); 
fitting the foot of the T (2) into the groove (7); 
welding the assembly, using a CO
2
 laser, via the 
upper surface (1B, 3B) of the head of the T (1, 3) 

by means of two welds which are inclined with 
respect to a line perpendicular to the external 

upper surface (1B, 3B) at a point (A) and have 
reverse respective inclinations so that the two 

welding axes (8A, 8B) intersect in the vicinity of 
the upper external surface (1B, 3B) of the head of 

the T (1, 3). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the directions of the welding axes (8A, 8B) are 

respectively parallel to the planes passing through a 
point (A) on the upper external surface (1B, 3B) and on 

the mid-plane of the T and through the corners formed by 
the foot (2) and the head (1, 3) of the T, a possible 

offset with respect to the said planes being determined 
as a function of the depth (P) of the groove (7).  

 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the angle of inclination (S) of the welding axes 

(8A, 8B), the thickness (L) of the foot of the T (2) and 
the depth (P) of the groove (7) are such that each 

welding axis (8A, 8B) passes through an upper corner (2C) 
of the foot of the T (2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the welding is performed 

continuously and in such way as to ensure that the end of 
the foot of the T (2) completely remelts and that a 

continuous connecting fillet (9) is obtained in each 
corner where the head (1, 3) and the foot (2) of the T 

are joined together. 
Process according to Claim 4, applied to the 
manufacture of an external duct arm of a turbojet engine 

with components made of a titanium-aluminium alloy, such 
as TA6V. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the thickness E of the head of the T (1, 3) is 

between 2.5 and 3 mm, the thickness L of the foot of the 
T (2) is equal to 1.5 mm and the depth (P) of the groove 

(7) varies between 0.1 and 2 mm along the profile. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the angle of inclination (S) of the welding axes 

(8A, 8B) is approximately equal to 15 degrees.
