<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a method that permittivities 
ε₁, ε₂, and ε₃ of principal axes of ferroelectric liquid 

crystals (7) are correctly measured. There are prepared a 
homeotropic cell in which a smectic layer composed of 

ferroelectric liquid crystals (7) to be subjected to 
measurement are aligned in parallel with substrates (1a, 

1b) and a planar homogeneous cell having a chevron layer 
structure in which the smectic layer composed of the 

ferroelectric liquid crystals (7) is bent in the middle 
portions thereof with respect to the substrates (1a, 1b). 

A high-frequency probe voltage having a level at which the 
orientation of the liquid crystal molecules does not change 

is applied to the homeotropic cell to measure a 
permittivity εh. The probe voltage is applied to the 

planar homogeneous cell to measure a permittivity εp. With 
a DC or low-frequency bias voltage applied to the planar 

homogeneous cell to align the spontaneous polarization of 
the liquid crystal molecules in a specified direction in 

the smectic layer, the probe voltage is applied to the cell 
to measure a permittivity εP
DC
. Based on the three 
permittivities εh, εp, and εp
DC
, the principal axis 
permittivities ε₁, ε₂, and ε₃ are obtained according to a 

specified relational expression.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for measuring the physical properties of liquid
crystals, and more particularly to a method and apparatus
for measuring the physical properties of ferroelectric
liquid crystals.Since ferroelectric liquid crystals have the
advantages of memory properties, high response speed, and a
wide angle of visibility in comparison with nematic liquid
crystals which are widely used currently, there have been
conducted extensive researches on the material as a liquid
crystal display material in the next generation.Fig. 7 shows a sectional view of an exemplified
liquid crystal element (liquid crystal cell) sealing
therein ferroelectric liquid crystals. The liquid crystal
cell has two glass substrates a1 and 1b arranged opposite
to each other. A plurality of transparent signal
electrodes 2a made of indium tin oxide (referred to as 
"ITO" hereinafter) and so on are arranged mutually in
parallel on a surface of one glass substrate 1a, and a
transparent insulating film 3a made of SiO2 or the like is
formed on the electrodes. On a surface of the other glass
substrate 1b is arranged a plurality of scanning electrodes
2b mutually in parallel in a direction perpendicular to the
signal electrodes 2a, and a transparent insulating film 3b
made of SiO2 or the like is coated on the electrodes. On
the insulating films 3a and 3b are formed respectively
orientation films 4a and 4b which have undergone a uniaxial
orientation process such as a rubbing process. As a
material for the orientation films 4a and 4b, there is
adopted an organic macromolecular film such as a polyimide
film, a nylon film and a polyvinyl alcohol film, an SiO2
oblique evaporation film, or the like. In normal cases,
the orientation process is performed so that the liquid
crystal molecules are oriented approximately in parallel
with the electrode substrates. The two glass substrates 1a
and 1b are adhered to each other by means of a sealing
agent 6 with interposition of a spacer 5 for cell thickness
control with an inlet (not shown) left in a portion.
Through the inlet, ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) 7 is
put into a space defined by the orientation films 4a and
4b, and then the inlet is sealed with a sealing agent 8.
The outside surfaces of the two glass substrates 1a and 1b 
are respectively provided with respective polarizing plates
12a and 12b arranged so that their axes of polarization
cross each other at right angles. An assembly substrate 9
is composed of the glass substrate 1a, the signal
electrodes
