<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field
of polymers, and more specifically to polymers that resist
mineral deposition in aqueous environments.Polymeric acetal resins (polyacetals) are resistant to
degradation in aqueous environments and are therefore
useful in applications in which the polymer is in contact
with water for extended periods of time. Polyacetals also
have excellent physical and mechanical properties. This
combination of properties makes polyacetals particularly
useful in plumbing application, such as water faucets and
showerheads.A problem that is encountered with essentially all
materials when used in plumbing fixtures is the
accumulation of mineral deposits. This problem occurs with
metals as well as plastics. The problem is especially
noticeable in showerheads, where large volumes of water
pass through small openings at elevated temperatures. The
mineral build-up is generally more noticeable when "hard"
water is used (i.e. water with a high mineral content) and
is often a problem in rural areas which rely on wells for
water. This mineral accumulation results in unsightly
deposits, and in some instances, such as showerheads, the
accumulated minerals can eventually interfere with the
operation of the plumbing fixture. If a material can be 
found which resists the accumulation and adhesion of such
mineral deposits, certain plumbing fixtures, such as
showerheads, could be designed with a longer useful life.Inorganic fillers are often included in polymeric
acetals and other polymers to modify the physical properties
according to the particular end use. However, it does not
appear that practitioners in the art have recognized that
certain inorganic fillers improve the resistance of specific
polymers to the build-up and adhesion of mineral deposits.Compositions have now been discovered which resist the
build-up and adhesion of mineral deposits in aqueous
environments containing dissolved minerals. These
compositions comprise a polymeric acetal and a filler which
is zinc oxide at a level of 4.5% to 10% by
weight, preferably at a level of 5% to 10% by
weight, and most preferably at a level of about 7.5% by
weight.The composition can also include other additives such
as mold lubricants, plasticizers, other fillers, glass
fibers, nucleating agents, antioxidants, formaldehyde
scavengers, chain scission inhibitors, ultraviolet light
inhibitors, impact modifiers, acid scavengers, and
colorants.The invention also provides a method for making shaped
articles which resist the deposition of
