<CLAIMS>
A mail-processing machine including an electrical power
supply (1) for powering at least one control motor (2), and a safety locking

circuit electrically connected to a cover switch (3) of the machine and
co-operating with the electrical power supply to switch the power supply off

whenever the cover of the machine is open, said machine being
characterised by a chopper electrical power supply comprising at least one

power chopper circuit (16) having a control (18), and in that the safety
locking circuit includes at least one electromechanical relay (17) electrically

connecting the power chopper circuit to its control.
Mail-processing machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that at least one power chopper circuit further comprises a

transistor and a resistor that are connected to at least one
electromechanical relay.
Mail-processing machine according to claim 2,
characterised in that at least one electromechanical relay comprises a

contact (171) and a control coil (172) that is connected in series with the
cover switch (3) and controls the opening/closing of the contact (171) which

electrically couples the transistor and the resistor to the control circuit (18).
Mail-processing machine according to claim 3,
characterised in that said electrical power supply further comprises a divider

bridge (15) connected to an inlet of the control circuit (18).
Mail-processing machine according to claim 4,
characterised in that it further comprises a reference voltage (Vref) that is

delivered to the control circuit (18), with said circuit delivering signals to the
contact (171) on the basis of the voltage coming from the divider bridge (15)

and of the reference voltage.
