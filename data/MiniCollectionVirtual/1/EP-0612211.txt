<ABSTRACT>
The rate and character of mammalian hair growth is altered by the topical application to the skin of a composition containing an organic inhibitor of the enzyme L-asparagine synthetase. A topical composition for reducing the rate and altering the character of mammalian hair growth comprises a non-toxic dermatologically acceptable vehicle and from 0.1 to 30 % based on the total weight of the composition of an organic inhibitor of L-asparagine synthetase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cosmetic method for altering the
rate and character of mammalian hair growth particularly androgen-stimulated hair
growth, by topical application to the skin of a composition containing an inhibitor
of the enzyme L-asparagine synthetase.It has previously been proposed that the rate of hair growth, as well
as the character of hair can be modified by topical application of inhibitors of
certain enzymes such as inhibitors of 5-α-reductase or ornithine decarboxylase, or
such antiandrogens as androgen receptor binding agents, as described in U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,720,489 and 4,885,289. Moreover, it has been theorized that certain other
enzymes, including gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, are involved in various stages
of hair follicle formation or of hair growth, but the relation between the various
enzymes and the reactions which they control, as well as their effect upon each
other and upon hair growth, has not been fully understood, as appears from
Richards et al., Cancer Research, Vol. 42, 4143-4152 (1982) and DeYoung et al,
Cancer Research, Vol. 38, 3697-3701 (1978); and Chase, Physiol. Zool. Vol 24, 1-8
(1951).David A. Conney et al., Int. J. Biochem., Vol. 11, 519-539 (1980)
discloses a range of organic compounds capable of inhibiting L-asparaginase
synthetase. WO 86/02269 discloses topical compositions for altering hair growth
comprising progesterone which inhibits L-asparagine synthetase (see David A.
Conney et al. above, Table 11). US-A-4,283,386 discloses topical compositions for
treating skin disorders and for cosmetic purposes (hair care) comprising cysteine
sulfinic acids. US-A-4,439,432 discloses topical compositions comprising
progesterone, which may be used for treating abnormal hair growth.
US-A-4,248,861 discloses topical compositions for preventing deleterious effects
of solar radiation comprising calcium pantothenate, which is a strong inhibitor of L-asparagine
synthetase. (see David A. Conney et al. above, Table 9).In the present invention it has been found that the rate and character
of mammalian 
(including human) hair growth, particularly
androgen-stimulated hair growth, can be modified by
topical application to the skin of a composition
containing an organic inhibitor of the enzyme L-asparagine
synthetase. Inorganic inhibitors such
as zinc chloride are undesirable because they tend
to be irritants.According to the present invention there is provided a cosmetic
method of reducing the rate and altering the character of mammalian hair growth
comprising applying to

<CLAIMS>
A cosmetic method of reducing the rate and altering the character of
mammalian hair growth comprising applying to the mammalian skin, a composition

comprising a non-toxic, dermatologically acceptable vehicle and a sufficient amount of
an organic inhibitor of L-asparagine synthetase, but excluding progesterone.
The method of claim 1, wherein said amount of said organic inhibitor is
0.1 to 30%, based on the total weight of the composition and wherein said inhibitor is

selected from guanidinosuccinic acid, oxalacetic acid, cysteine sulfinic acid, diethyl
aminomalonate or ethacrynic acid.
The method of claims 1 or 2, wherein said composition is adapted for
application from 10 to 7,500 µg of inhibitor per square centimeter of skin.
