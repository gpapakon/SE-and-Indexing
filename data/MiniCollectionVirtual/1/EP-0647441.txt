<ABSTRACT>
Before retiring to bed, the collar plate (1) is comfortably placed around the neck with the square opening (13) facing the larynx. The soft band (7) is placed around the neck and the end is connected with the loop and hook fastener (10). The other end (11) continues to adhere on the loop and hook fastener which is also fastened as mirror image from the opposite side (10) via three tubular rivets (9) on the collar plate. Before sleeping, the electronic unit is actuated by means of a switch (3). When the unit is switched on a brief beep sound is heard indicating readiness for operation. When the microphone (4) picks up a snoring sound, an impulse is passed to the electronic unit (6) and this triggers a brief beep sound - lasting about 0.3 to 0.4 seconds - in the buzzer (5). The snorer detects this sound subconsciously via two 3 mm openings on the inside of the collar, so that snoring is interrupted from the onset. The same occurs should the snorer speak in his sleep. A 3 volt button cell (2) supplies the unit with current via cables housed in the cable duct (8). If required, the cell can be easily exchanged via a flap provided for the purpose on the inside of the collar plate.
