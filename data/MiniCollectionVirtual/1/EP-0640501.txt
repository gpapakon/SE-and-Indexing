<ABSTRACT>
A tire inflation pressure monitoring apparatus (10) 
comprises a reference magnet (15) fixed to a wheel (11), 

a movable magnet (16) whose position shifts depending on 
the inflation pressure of a tire (12), and a magnetic 

sensor (41) for detecting the magnetism of the magnets 
(15, 16). The reference magnet (15) can be moved in the 

axial direction of the wheel (11) by means of a position 
adjusting mechanism (2). Thus, a relative distance (D₀) 

from the reference magnet (15) to the movable magnet 
(16) can be adjusted to a fixed value (e.g., zero) at 

the time of calibration. An electric circuit section 
(50) is stored with a computation formula or a map 

indicative of the relationships between outputs of the 
magnetic sensor (41) and minimum distances (L₁, L₂) from 

the magnets (15, 16) to the magnetic sensor (41). In 
detecting the inflation pressure of the tire (12), data 

associated with the minimum distances (L₁, L₂) from the 
magnetic sensor (41) to the magnets (15, 16) are 

obtained according to the computation formula or map 
on the basis of the outputs obtained by means of the 

magnetic sensor (41). Based on these data, the inflation 
pressure of the tire (12) is obtained according to 

a pressure computation formula or a map indicative of 
the relationship between the tire inflation pressure and 

the distance between the magnets (15, 16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tire inflation 
pressure monitoring apparatus for checking the inflation 
pressure of pneumatic tires of, for example, vehicles, 
aircraft, etc. Described in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKOKU Publication 
No. 4-40211 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,857), U.S. Pat. 
No. 4,953,394, etc. are tire inflation pressure 
monitoring apparatuses which are proposed as means 
for detecting the inflation pressure of the tires of a 
vehicle while the vehicle is running. In these monitoring 
apparatuses, a transducer including a movable magnet 
is attached to a wheel rotating integrally with a tire, 
and a magnetic sensor is attached to a member on the 
vehicle body side. The movable magnet is designed so as 
to shift its position in the axial direction of the 
wheel as the tire inflation pressure changes. Thus, the 
higher the inflation pressure, the shorter the minimum 
distance from the movable magnet to the magnetic sensor 
is. The magnetic sensor, which includes a magnetic 
coil, is used to detect the magnetism of the magnet as 
the wheel rotates, and generates an electromotive force 
of a magnitude corresponding to the minimum distance 
from the magnet by magnetic induction. This 
electromotive force is converted into a digital integral 
by means of an integrator and analog-to-digital  
 
converter. Hereinafter, this value will be referred to 
as A/D integral. The movable magnet moves for a distance proportional 
to the tire inflation pressure in the axial 
direction of the wheel. If the position of the movable 
magnet with the tire at a reference pressure and the 
changing rate of the position of the movable magnet, 
compared to the change in pressure, are obtained in 
advance, therefore, the pressure can be obtained by 
detecting the moved distance of the magnet by using some 
suitable means (e.g., magnetic sensor). Theoretically, 
therefore, it is necessary only that the change of the 
minimum distance from the magnetic sensor to the movable 
magnet be computed in accordance with the variation of 
the A/D integral of the aforesaid induced electromotive 
force so that the tire inflation pressure can be 
obtained on the basis of the change in distance. Actually, however, the wheels of a running vehicle 
roll in some measure as they rotate. As the vehicle 
corners, moreover, the wheels are subjected to a lateral 
load, so that they are distorted or axially moved with 
respect to the vehicle body. Inevitably, therefore, the 
distance from the magnetic sensor to each wheel varies. 
Thus, the minimum
