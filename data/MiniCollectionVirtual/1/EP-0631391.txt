<ABSTRACT>
A decoded counter employing a shift register and a 
zero-detect circuit has the ability of returning to a 

correct state within a limited number of clock cycles 
if, by accidental reasons, an invalid state is assumed 

by the counter. One of the flip-flops is provided with 
synchronous set while all the other flip-flops of the 

shift register are provided with synchronous reset. 
The output of the last flip-flop of the register drives 

a single set-reset line common to all the flip-flops 
and the pull-up line of the zero-detect circuit is 

connected to the input of the first flip-flop of the 
register. Optionally, one of the flip-flops may be 

provided with asynchronous set and the others with an 
asynchronous reset, for initializing the counter in a 

certain state through a single clear-load line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decoded counter
employing a shift register and which is capable of
self-correcting any invalid state that may accidentally
be assumed by the counter.The field of the application of shift registers (SR)
is extremely wide and differentiated and includes also
counters. In fact, if for example the output of the
last edge-triggered, D, flip-flop (FF) of a shift
register (SR) is connected to the input of the first
flip-flop and if to a reset input of anyone of the
flip-flops is fed a logic "1", a so-called, "N-module"
counter is implemented, where N is the number of flip-flops
that form the shift register. A counter of this
type, hereinbelow referred to also by the acronym CSR,
is schematically shown in Fig. 1.It is also well known, that the above is not a
widely used solution for reallizing a counter because
of several drawbacks, among which:
i) Silicon area requirements. An N-module binary
counter is normally implemented with a number of
FF equal to the unfractionary portion of
log2(N)+1 (if N is a multiple of 2, a number
given by log2(N) of FF would be sufficient). By
contrast an equivalent counter, made with a shift
register, would require an N number of FF.ii) Power consumption. Because a CSR requires a
larger number of FF, it will load more heavily
the timing system (clock signal).iii) Number of possible states. An N-module, binary
counter has 2k possible states (k is the minimum
whole number such that 2k be ≧ N). Conversely, a
CSR has 2N possible states. In particular, if,
because of a disturbance, a unique "1" is lost,
or if a second "1" is introduced, the CSR is no 
longer capable of "cleaning" itself and to return
in a correct state.Nothwithstanding these intrinsic drawbacks and
disadvantages, a CSR may be, and is, advantageously
used when extremely fast responses and symmetrical
clock/output delays are required.In fact, by assuming to have N signals that must
cyclically become "high", one at the time, a solution
could be that of using a binary counter followed by a
K→N decoder, as depicted in Fig. 2. However, an
alternative solution, could be that of using an N-module
CSR, as the one depicted in Fig. 1.The latter solution requires a larger number of FF,
but in this case, the silicon area that would be
required is not much different from the area that would
be required by the first solution, as long as N is not
too large. In fact, according to the first solution,
beside K number of FF, it is necessary to implement a
decoder whose architecture on the whole is not
mod
