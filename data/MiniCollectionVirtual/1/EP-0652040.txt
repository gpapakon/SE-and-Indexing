<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides contained 
in exhaust gases from combustions, which process 
comprises bringing said exhaust gases into contact 
with a Beta Zeolite exchanged with suitable amounts of 
cobalt salts, in the presence of a light hydrocarbon 
as the reducing agent. The emission of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), 
commonly defined as "NOx", from traveling sources, such 
as automobiles, and from stationary sources, such as 
gas turbines and power stations, is among the major 
sources of atmospheric pollution. The most effective techniques for removing NOx 
from the exhaust gases from combustions, can be 
classified into two categories: 
(1) flame treatment, which limit NOx generation; (2) post-combustion treatments. Typical flame treatments are carried out, e.g., 
by varying the reaction stoichiometry, or decreasing 
the combustion temperature. Such treatments make it 
possible the decrease in NOx formation to be attained 
with only limited success. Among post-combustion treatments, the catalytic 
processes result to be the most advantageous ones.  
 At present, nitrogen oxide removal is 
acoomplished at the industrial level through the so 
said "selective catalytic reduction" process (SCR 
process) carried out with ammonia, in the presence of 
a catalyst constituted by V2O5/TiO2, at a temperature 
comprised within the range of from 300 to 400°C. A 
conversion of nitrogen oxides of about 90% is 
described, which, however, decreases under operating 
conditions. This process also suffers from 
considerable drawbacks, such as e.g.: 
(a) catalyst cost, and short life time of said 
catalyst, due to poisoning and sintering 
phenomena; (b) presence of unreacted ammonia which, per se, is 
a pollutant; (c) reaction between ammonia and sulfates, leading to 
NH4HSO4 and (NH4)2SO4, which are corrosive for the 
facility components and poison the catalyst; (d) difficulty of storage, handling and use of 
ammonia in the facility. Owing to these problems, processes were studied 
which, on the one side, make it possible the direct 
catalytic decomposition to be performed of NOx, and, on 
the other side, aim at catalytically reducing NOx in 
the presence of different reducing agents from 
ammonia. For both said process types, the most promising 
catalysts resulted to be those of zeolitic type, 
exchanged with transition metal salts. As regards the direct catalytic decomposition  
 
processes, which preferably use ZSM-5 Zeolites 
exchanged with Cu2+
