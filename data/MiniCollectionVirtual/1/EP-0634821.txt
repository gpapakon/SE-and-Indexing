<ABSTRACT>
A bulb socket (A) for holding a wedge base bulb (B) which has 
a bulb portion (2), a base portion (3) and power terminals (5), the bulb 

socket (A) comprising a socket body (10), supplying terminals (13) and 
holder members (14). The socket body (10) is provided for receiving 

the base portion (3) of the wedge base bulb (B). The supplying 
terminals (13) are electrically connecting with the respective 

power terminals (5) of the wedge base bulb (B) under a predetermined 
pressure, and are held by the socket body (10). The holder members (14) 

are holding the base portion (3) of the wedge base bulb (B) 
therebetween under a predetermined pressure. And the holder 

members (14) are separate from the supplying terminals (13), and are 
attached to the socket body (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulb socket for holding a
wedge base bulb to supply electric power thereto.One conventional socket for holding a wedge base bulb
to supply electric power thereto is disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 2-47787. In this
construction, a pair of metal members is attached to a
socket body, and a supplying terminal resiliently-engageable
portion, which is formed on each of these
metal members, is exposed in a bulb insertion hole. When a
base portion of the wedge base bulb is fitted in the bulb
insertion hole, two power terminals mounted on the base
portion are contacted respectively with the supplying terminals
of the two metal members, so that electric power can
be supplied to the wedge base bulb. At the same time, rugged
portions formed on the base portion engage the resiliently-engageable
portions of the two metal members, respectively,
so that the base portion is held between the
two resiliently-engageable portions to thereby prevent the
wedge base bulb from withdrawal.When attaching the wedge base bulb to the socket, it is
desirable that a contact resistance at the contact location
between each supplying terminal and the associated power
terminal be low, and it is also desirable that a resilient
force at that contact location between each resiliently-engageable
portion and the associated rugged portion be
large.However, in the conventional construction, the supplying
terminal portion, for supplying electric power to the
wedge base bulb, and the resiliently-engageable portion,
for holding the wedge base bulb, are formed as an integral
metal member made of a single material. Therefore, the material
of the metal member is required to perform both the
function to reduce the contact resistance and the function 
to increase the resilient force of the resiliently-engageable
portion; however, there exists no material
which can achieve both functions at a high level and
at low costs, and as a result both functions have not been
entirely satisfactory.In the meantime, a requirement for such a bulb socket,
when used on a vehicle body, is that the amount of rearward
projection of a light device should be reduced. Therefore,
there is known a construction in which the other end of
each metal member exposed in a bulb insertion hole is extended
perpendicularly to the bulb insertion hole, so that
the whole of the bulb socket assumes an L-shape.In this case, the metal member is also of an L-shape,
and hence can not be inserted into a casing through the
bulb insertion
