<DESCRIPTION>
PYRIDINE-3-CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS OR AMIDES USEFUL AS 5-HT3 ANTAGONISTSThis invention relates to novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their preparation and their use as pharmaceuticals.EP-A-220011 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) describes the use of a benzamide derivative as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.GB 1555682 (Ciba-Geigy) describes a group of 2-methoxy-3-pyridylamides.A group of novel compounds has now been discovered, which compounds are pyridinyl-amide and -ester derivatives, and possess 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:
 (I)whereinR-) is C-j-6 alkoxy, C3.8 cycloalkoxy or C3.8 cycloalkyl C1 -.4 alkoxy; R2 is hydrogen, halo, C-|_6 alkyl, C-\ .Q alkoxy or amino optionally substituted by one or two C-| _6 alkyl groups;R3 is hydrogen, halo or C-|_6 alkyl; L is O or NH; andZ is a di-azacyclic or azabicyclic side chain; having 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity.Suitable examples of alkyl moieties in R-j to R3 include methyl, ethyl, n- and /so-propyl, n-, iso-, sec- and tert-butylSuitable examples of halo moieties include fluoro, chloro and bromo. 

 In particular, R-j is methoxy, R2 is NH2 and R3 is chloro.Suitable examples of Z are described in the art relating to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ie. as follows:i) GB 2125398A (Sandoz Limited) ii) GB 2152049A (Sandoz Limited) iii) EP-A-215545 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) iv) EP-A-21 772 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) v) EP-A-377967 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) vi) WO 91/05174 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) vii) EP-A-358903 (Dianippon)Particular side chains of interest are depicted thus:TropaneGranataneOxa/t ϊa/aza-granatanef " 

QuinuclidineIsoquinuclidineIsogranataneOxa/thia-isogranataneIsotropanewhereinR is hydrogen or methyl; and X is oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen optionally substituted by C-j _6 alkyl, C3-8 cycloalkyl, C3-8 cycloalkyl C1-4 alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, phenyl C-]_4 alkyl or naphthyl C1-4 alkyl wherein a phenyl or naphthyl moiety is optionally substituted by one or more of halo, C-|_6 alkoxy or C-j-6 alkyl. 

 Side chains Z of particular interest include tropane, granatane, oxagranatane and azagranatane, where R is methyl. Suitable values for N-substituents when X is N are as described in WO 91/05174, for example, /sσ-propyl or ethyl.L is preferably NH.Alternatively, COL in formula (I) may be replaced by a bioisostere therefor, for example, 1 ,2,4-oxadiazole and the other groups of structure h) described in EP-A-377967 (Beecham Group
