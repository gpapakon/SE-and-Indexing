<ABSTRACT>
In a tundish for a multi-strand casting installation for casting identical or different steel sections, at least one nozzle block (5) is provided for each strand. In order to achieve simple adjustment to different sections, a nozzle brick (7) of the nozzle block (5) has a rotationally symmetrical circumferential surface (8) which can be inserted into a correspondingly rotationally symmetrical aperture (9) in a perforated brick (6). The outlet opening (10) of the nozzle brick (7) lies eccentrically with respect to the axis (A) of rotation of the rotationally symmetrical circumferential surface (8).

<CLAIMS>
Tundish for a multi-strand continuous casting installation for casting the
same or different steel profiles, provided on which there is at least one

discharge block for each strand which comprises a refractory apertured
brick and a refractory nozzle brick with a discharge opening inserted into

it, characterised in that the nozzle brick (7) has a rotationally
symmetrical peripheral surface (8), which may be inserted into a

correspondingly rotationally symmetrical opening (9) in the apertured
brick (6) in different angular positions, and that the discharge opening

(10) of the nozzle brick (7) is disposed eccentrically with respect to the
rotational axis (A) of the rotationally symmetrical peripheral surface (8).
Tundish as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that at least two
discharge blocks (5) are inserted into an opening (2, 3, 4) in the tundish

(1) and gaps between the edge of the opening (2, 3, 4) and the discharge
blocks (5) are filled with refractory material.
Tundish as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that make-up plates (13)
constituting the refractory material are inserted into the gaps.
Tundish as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the tundish (1) has a plurality of openings (2, 3, 4) into which the

discharge blocks (5) are inserted.
Discharge block for a metallurgical vessel, particularly a tundish, which 
comprises a refractory apertured brick (6) and a nozzle brick (7) with a

discharge opening (10) inserted into it, characterised in that the nozzle
brick (7) has a rotationally symmetrical peripheral surface (8), which

may be inserted into a correspondingly rotationally symmetrical opening
(9) in the apertured brick (6) in different angular positions, and that the

discharge opening (10) of the nozzle brick (7) is disposed eccentrically
with respect to the rotational axis (A) of the rotationally symmetrical

peripheral surface (8).
Discharge block as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the
peripheral surface (8) is of circular conical shape.
Discharge block as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the
apertured brick (6) is rectangular, particularly square.
Discharge block as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that a reserve discharge opening is provided in the nozzle brick (7).
Discharge block as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that markings are formed on the apertured brick (6) and a mark (12) is

provided on the nozzle brick (7).
