<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing a method of evaluating a current-driven conductive material such as wiring 
conductor, in which the resistance to electromigration and the resistance to stress migration are independently measured 

in a short time. A first current is supplied to a conductor to measure its resistance value, and a second current larger 
than the first current is supplied for a predetermined period to cause its physical properties to change. Thereafter, 

the resistance value of the conductor is again measured by using the first current. This procedure is repeated for 
accelerated evaluation of reliability of the conductor. In this method, the duration of the second current is sufficiently 

smaller than that of the first current so that electromigration may be measured within a temperature rise of 50°C. To 
measure stress migration, on the other hand, the second current is set so that electromigration may not occur, and it 

is fed at intervals less than 10 ms so that the temperature rise may exceed 100°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of evaluating 
current-driven conductive material, and more particularly to a 
method of evaluating electro-migration resistance and stress 
migration resistance of various types of current-driven 
conductive material independently and efficiently. The conventional technology is described below for a 
wiring material for LSI as an example of current-driven 
conductive material. As wiring material for LSI, at present, such 
materials as Al, Al-Si alloy prepared by mixing several percents 
of Si in Al or Ai-Si-Cu alloy in which a small quantity of Cu is 
mixed have been used. As a degree of integration in LSI becomes higher and 
higher, a width of wiring therein becomes thinner and thinner 
with the length becoming increasingly longer, and also a number 
of wires used therein is becoming larger. On the other hand, in 
LSI, a higher operating speed is required together with a higher 
degree of integration, and as a result, a current flowing in a 
wire has been becoming increasingly larger. Namely density of a 
current flowing per unit cross section has been becoming higher 
and higher as a degree of integration becomes increasingly 
higher. However, when a large current flows in a metallic wire, 
metal atoms moves In a direction reverse to that in which the 
current flows, and as a result a portion of the wire may become 
thinner and thinner and sometimes result in breaking of wire. 
This phenomenon is called electro-migration. Furthermore when 
density of a current flowing through wiring increases, heat 
stress due to Joule heat generation in the wiring and the wiring  
 
is deteriorated. This phenomenon is called stress migration. it 
is not too much saying that reliability of metal wiring is 
decided by the two phenomena described above. For this reason, 
in order to develop a high performance LSI, a material having a 
high capability to withstand the electro-migration and stress 
migration is required, and in development of the material, it is 
important to strictly evaluate the material's capability to 
withstand the phenomena. The conventional method of evaluating 
reliability of wiring is as described below. In the conventional type of LSI wiring, only a current 
having a density of around 105 A/cm² is flown, but in the 
reliability test, a current with a current density of 10⁶ A/cm², 
10 times or more larger than the usual one, is flown to shorten 
the time required for a wiring reliability test. In addition, to 
furthermore promote deterioration, a method

A method of evaluating current-driven conductive 
material for evaluating a capability of wiring material to 

withstand electro-migration within a shorter period of time by 
repeating several times an operating cycle comprising the steps 

of: flowing a first current in a wiring pattern made of 
conductive material to measure a resistance value of the wiring 

pattern, then flowing a second current having a current value 
larger than said first current for a specified period of time to 

generate electro-migration in said wiring pattern, then turning 
off said second current, again flowing said first current to 

measure a resistance value in said wiring pattern, wherein the 
capability of said wiring to withstand electro-migration is 

evaluated by adjusting a time for flowing said second current to
