<ABSTRACT>
A biodegradable multipurpose functional fluid for agricultural or 
construction machinery, comprising a base oil, a detergent-dispersant and 

an antioxidant (and a viscosity index improver if desired), in which the 
base oil is a fatty acid triester of trimethylolpropane obtained from a fatty 

acid that either has from 40% to 70% by weight of caprylic acid and from 
20% to 50% by weight of capric acid, or is derived from a coconut oil 

which has been adjusted to have a stearic acid content of from 10 % to 20 
% by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multipurpose functional fluid for 
agricultural machinery or construction machinery, such as a multipurpose 
functional fluid for tractors. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
multipurpose functional fluid for agricultural machinery or construction 
machinery, that fluid showing good biodegradability and performance that 
is almost equal to that of conventional multipurpose functional fluids that 
use a mineral oil as base oil. Recently, multipurpose functional fluids have been used as 
lubricating hydraulic fluids for various construction machinery and 
agricultural machinery. The multipurpose functional fluids are used for 
lubrication of power transmission devices (e.g., speed change gear and 
differential gear), elevating operation parts of machine tools and hydraulic 
systems (e.g., power steering system), and for lubrication of engine 
systems and wet type brake systems. Conventionally employed 
multipurpose functional fluids are prepared by compounding a mineral oil 
as a base oil with a detergent dispersant and an antioxidant and, if 
necessary, a viscosity index improver and other additives. In recent years, lubricating fluids that leak from various machinery 
or waste lubricating oils cause problems of environmental pollution. For 
example, pollution of lake or sea is caused by two-stroke-cycle engine oils 
for motorboats. Waste pollution is caused by two-stroke-cycle engine oils 
for machine tools, such as those for chain saws. To cope with the 
pollutions, studies were made of the use of a fatty acid triglyceride having 
good biodegradability, e.g., a vegetable oil, as the base oil in place of the 
mineral oil. Studies are now being made of the use of two-stroke-cycle 
engine oils containing fatty acid triglyceride as the base oil. Research has been made for the improvement of the 
biodegradability of hydraulic fluids. Studies in the field of hydraulic fluids  
 
include the use of fatty acid triglyceride having good biodegradability, such 
as a vegetable oil. See: SAE Technical Paper No. 910960, April 9-10, 
1991). The present inventors have studied the use of a vegetable oil as the 
base oil in place of the mineral oil in accordance with technical information 
obtained so far. However, they have concluded that a multipurpose 
functional fluid using a vegetable oil as the base oil has insufficient 
stability, particularly in the oxidation stability. The use, in lubricating products, of base oils other than mineral oils 
for their
