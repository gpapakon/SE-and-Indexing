<ABSTRACT>
An information model based on a physical system, such as the physical equipment in a power system. An object-oriented information model provides a generic power system model that may be applied to any of several specific applications. In the invention, physical pieces of equipment are represented as objects with attributes that can be verified (primary data) and relations including connectivity, grouping, and location. The model handles all known configurations of power systems and is extensible to new configurations. Attribute input is supported from primary sources and is used to calculate data required by applications programs. A window-based graphical user interface uniquely simplifies operation of the database. Thus, the present invention provides a single, easy to use, source for all proprietary application databases at a utility.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INFORMATION MODEL BASED ON A PHYSICAL SYSTEMA portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to object-oriented systems analysis. More particularly, the present invention relates to an object-oriented information model based on an underlying physical system, including associated infrastructure and personnel, for example the equipment which makes up an electric utility power system.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTElectrical power systems are large complex physical systems with many types of interconnected electrical equipment. Such systems are often modeled for various reasons within the departments that make up the utility which is responsible for operating the power system.Each department within the utility typically maintains its own specific database, usually employing a proprietary application program. This proprietary application program 

is tightly coupled to a particular operating system, computer manufacturer, data structure, etc. That is, the proprietary application programs employed in the various departments of the utility are vendor specific and cannot be interfaced with or exchange data with the application programs used in other departments (and often with those within the same department) . Thus, in a utility, information is not freely exchangeable between the various departments of the utility, such as planning, engineering, operations etc.The present state of the art is such that the various proprietary application programs are, at best, difficult for a department to use and maintain. That is, the user interface in most such programs requires the manipulation of strings of raw data, or the entry of data into crude forms. Thus, highly skilled personnel are required for the performance of a tedious and repetitive task.Additionally, known database structures as are employed in such application programs merely provide virtual models of a power system based on abstract mathematical descriptions of system equipment. Such models are generic approximations of actual installed equipment within the power system. Thus, there is an inherent error in the model. When the error that is present in several separate databases

CLAIMS
1. A method for creating an information model based on a physical system, comprising the steps of: identifying all physical elements in a system; creating an object table for said physical elements; determining a set of attributes common to each object; and grouping the objects by common attributes to establish a relationship between the elements which defines the physical system.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of: establishing a hierarchy of objects based on type relation among the objects.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein said hierarchy defines a type-supertype relationship.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said object table creating step further comprises the step of: assigning a unique surrogate key to each object by which said object is identified with said object table.
5. A method for creating a single source information model based on physical equipment in a power system, comprising the steps of: identifying all physical equipment in the power system; creating an object table for said physical equipment; determining a set of attributes common to each object; and grouping the objects by common attributes to establish 


 234
a relationship between the objects which defines the power system.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of: assigning a unique surrogate key to each object by which the object is known in the object table.
7. The method of claim 5, further comprising: establishing a defined user interface based on a window environment.
8. The method of claim 5, further comprising: importing data from a proprietary database associated with a different system, such that a single point of maintenance is provided.
9. The method of claim 5, further comprising: exporting data to a proprietary database associated with a different system, such that a single point of maintenance is provided.
10. The method of claim 5, further comprising: assigning a network position identifier to selected objects which is independent of specific object attributes and which serves as a place holder within the power system model.
11. A method for creating a single source information model based on physical elements in a system, comprising the steps of: creating an extensible type hierarchy; identifying as objects said physical elements; collapsing said objects into tables, where attributes 


 235
specific to all objects below base types are collapsed into type tables, and all objects above base types are collapsed into object tables, using a common object table with surrogate keys; and externalizing and collapsing object relationships into tables, using typing to identify the type and relationship.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising the step of: allowing a user to extend said types down the hierarchy.
13. A single source information model based on physical equipment in a power system, comprising: an object table, including a plurality of objects which identify all physical equipment in the power system, each object including a set of common attributes, said objects being grouped by said common attributes to establish a relationship between the objects which defines the power system.
