High voltage measuring device for electric high-voltage 
switchgear, having an encapsulating housing and 

a measuring electrode (4) incorporated therein, as well 
as an electrical conductor (6) connected to said 

electrode and passing in an insulated manner through the 
wall of the encapsulating housing (1), which conductor 

carries a measuring signal,
 
characterised by an earthed resilient contact (10, 11) 

which is disposed outside the encapsulating housing (1) 
and which, if no measuring device is connected to the 

conductor (6), rests on said conductor in order to earth 
same, but which can be lifted off if necessary when a 

measuring device is connected. 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 1,
 
characterised by a circuit housing (19) enclosing a 

device, which may if necessary be placed on the 
conductor (6), for processing and/or passing on the 

measuring signal, the circuit housing being connected to 
a device which, when placed on the conductor (6) lifts 

the contact (10, 11) therefrom. 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the circuit housing (19) can be 

placed on a measuring housing (7) containing the contact 
(10, 11) and having at least one element (15, 16) for 

lifting the contact (10, 11), which element is 
actuatable from outside in such a manner that the 

lifting element (15, 16) is permanently actuated. 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 1 
or one of the subsequent claims,
 
characterised in that the device for processing and/or 

passing on the measuring signal is connectable to one 
end of the conductor (6) via a plug contact (21, 22)  

 
which can be joined by placing the circuit housing (19) 

on the conductor (6). 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 1 
or one of the subsequent claims,
 
characterised in that the conductor (6) is connected to 

earth potential via a discharger (8, 9). 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 3 
or one of the subsequent claims,
 
characterised in that the measuring housing (7) has at 

least one blow-out aperture (12, 13). 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that the blow-out aperture (12, 13) has 

a device for diverting the blow-out gas. 
High voltage measuring device according to claim 1 
or one of the subsequent claims,
 
characterised in that circuit housings (19) containing 

various different circuit arrangements can be placed on 
the conductor (6) as an alternative.
