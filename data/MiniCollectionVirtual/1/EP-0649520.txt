<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to rechargeable electrochemical cells, and 
more particularly, to an apparatus for testing the internal pressure of sealed rechargeable 
electrochemical cells during operation and a method of using this apparatus. Rechargeable electrochemical cells may be used as direct replacements for primary 
AA, C, and D cells in numerous consumer devices such as calculators, portable radios, 
and flashlights. Often, rechargeable cells are integrated into a sealed power pack that is 
designed to interface with a specific device. In sealed power packs, weight and portability 
are important considerations. Long operating life and maintenance free operation are 
desirable characteristics for all rechargeable cells. A rechargeable cell is ideally suited to serve as a portable power source due to its 
small size, light weight, high power capacity and long operating life. A rechargeable cell 
may operate as an "install and forget" power source. With the exception of periodic 
charging, such a rechargeable cell typically performs without attention and rarely becomes 
the limiting factor in the life of the device it powers. Rechargeable cells using a hydrogen storage negative electrode are known in the 
art. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,551,400 (hereinafter "the 400 patent") for 
HYDROGEN STORAGE MATERIALS AND METHODS OF SIZING AND 
PREPARING THE SAME FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL APPLICATIONS. 
(Cells using rechargeable hydrogen storage 
negative electrodes are hereinafter referred to as "hydrogen storage cells.") Hydrogen 
storage cells operate in a different manner from lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, or other prior 
art battery systems. The metal hydride negative electrode used in hydrogen storage cells 
is capable of the reversible electrochemical storage of hydrogen. In hydrogen storage 
cells, the positive electrode is typically formed of a nickel hydroxide material. A suitable 
separator, spacer, or membrane may be positioned between the negative and positive 
electrodes. Hydrogen storage cells operate with a nickel hydroxide positive electrode; a 
hydrogen storage alloy negative electrode, and a non-woven, felt, nylon or polypropylene 
separator. The electrolyte is generally 20 to 45 weight percent potassium hydroxide.  
 Hydrogen storage cells offer important advantages over conventional rechargeable 
cells. Hydrogen storage cells have significantly higher specific charge capacities (both 
in terms of ampere hours per unit mass and ampere hours per unit volume) than do cells 
that
