<ABSTRACT>
A planar, topology free, semiconductor quantum-well 
laser is described. The quantum-well active layer is formed 

and patterned in a specified region which is constrained on 
all sides by high bandgaps which are formed through the use 

of impurity-free diffusion techniques. After the impurity-free 
diffusion has taken place, an upper portion is then 

epitaxially deposited to complete the structure. High-power, 
single fundamental mode laser operation is achieved by 

funneling current into the constrained quantum-well active 
region, high bandgap regions in conjunction with low index of 

refraction in regions surrounding the active area. 
The structure is further designed to allow low beam 
divergence in the direction perpendicular to the 

semiconductor laser junction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a semiconductor
laser, and more particularly to a planar, topology-free,
single-mode, high-power, quantum-well laser with non-absorbing
mirrors and current confinement.Ridge lasers are routinely used to fabricate single
lateral mode index guided lasers. A typical structure of
this type is described in US-A-5 059 552. Ridge lasers,
however, have the distinct disadvantage of having large
topologies (i.e., large differences in height between
neighboring elements), which makes them difficult to
fabricate and expensive to manufacture.Ridge lasers have an additional disadvantage in that
their topology causes a variation in the stress observed in
the waveguiding region. This stress is caused by the
dielectric and metallization layers--layers that are
necessary to form the structure. This can result in
difficulties in obtaining a well-confined single lateral mode
waveguiding action.GaAs and AlGaAs semiconductor laser structures have been
used successfully to fabricate quantum wells (QWs). Recent
developments have shown that a selective intermixing through
the use of a SiO2 cap can substantially increase the bandgap
of the QW. This technique is described in the article:
"Spatially selective modification of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
wells by SiO2 capping and rapid thermal annealing" by J. Y.
Chi, et al., published in the Appl. Phys. Lett. 55 (9), of
August 28, 1989, and has been successfully used to modify the
bandgap profile of QWs.Cleaving a semiconductor laser crystal has been 
advantageously used to form the facets of a laser. However,
for mass fabrication and monolithic integration, it is
desirable to use a relatively recent method, namely, forming
etched facets through the use of a chemically assisted ion
beam etching technique, which has been successfully used in
achieving results of similar quality to that of cleaved
facets. In the article: "Rectangular and L-shaped
GaAs/AlGaAs lasers with very high quality etched facets", by
A. Behfar-Rad, et al., published in the Appl. Phys. Lett. 54
(6), of February 6, 1989, a process based on a SiO2 etch mask
is described, which has led to very smooth etched facets.High power single lateral mode semiconductor lasers have
found their way in a variety of applications that range from
optical storage, Erbium-doped fiber amplification, and
frequency doubling. Reliability considerations show that it
is advantageous to have non-absorbing mirrors or facets for
semiconductor lasers and especially for high-power
semiconductor lasers.Moreover,
