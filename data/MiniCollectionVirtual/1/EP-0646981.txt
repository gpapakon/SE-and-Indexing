<ABSTRACT>
A strip-line filter is provided with upper- and lower-stage 
resonators having the same electromagnetic 

characteristics. Each of the resonators has a one-wavelength 
square-shaped strip line and four open-end transmission lines 

connected to four coupling points A,C,B and D (or E,G,F and H) 
of each reson
ator which are spaced 90 degrees in electric 
length in that order. The square-shaped strip lines have a 

pair of parallel coupling lines closely placed in parallel to 
each other to electromagnetically couple the resonators. 

Therefore, the filter can be manufactured in a small size. A 
first microwave resonated in each resonator is 

electromagnetically influenced by two open-end transmission 
lines connected to two coupling points A and B (or E and F), 

and a second microwave resonated in each resonator is 
electromagnetically influenced by two open-end transmission 

lines connected to two coupling points C and D (or G and H). 
Therefore, resonance wavelengths of the microwaves can be 

longer than a line length of each square-shaped strip line. 
Also, the resonance wavelengths can be adjusted by trimming 

the transmission lines. Also, because all constitutional 
elements are made of strip lines, the filter can be made 

plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a strip-line
filter utilized to filter microwaves in a communication
apparatus or a measuring apparatus operated in frequency bands
ranging from an ultra high frequency (UHF) band to a super
high frequency (SHF) band, and more particularly to a strip-line
filter in which a strip line is shortened and is made
plane at low cost. Also, the present invention relates
generally to a dual mode resonator utilized for an oscillator
or a strip-line filter, and more particularly to a dual mode
resonator in which two types microwaves are independently
resonated.A strip-line resonating filter is manufactured by
serially arranging a plurality of one-wavelength type of strip
line ring resonators to reduce radiation loss of microwaves 
transmitting through a strip line of the resonating filter.
However, there is a drawback in the strip-line resonating
filter that the resonating filter cannot be downsized.
Therefore, a dual mode strip-line filter in which microwaves
in two orthogonal modes are resonated and filtered has been
recently proposed. A conventional dual mode strip-line filter
is described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.Fig. 1 is a plan view of a conventional dual mode strip-line
filter Fig. 2A is a sectional view taken generally along
the line II-II of Fig. 1. Fig. 2B is another sectional view
taken generally along the line II-II of Fig. 1 according to a
modification. The conventional dual mode strip-line filter
of Fig. 1 is further described in EP-A-0,573,985.As shown in Fig. 1, a conventional dual mode strip-line
filter 11 comprises an input terminal 12 excited by
microwaves, a one-wavelength strip line ring resonator 13 in
which the microwaves are resonated, an input coupling
capacitor 14 connecting the input terminal 12 and a coupling
point A of the ring resonator 13 to couple the input terminal
12 excited by the microwaves to the ring resonator 13 in
capacitive coupling, an output terminal 15 which is excited by
the microwaves resonated in the ring resonator 13, an output
coupling capacitor 16 connecting the output terminal 15 and a
coupling point B in the ring resonator 13 to couple the output
terminal 15 to the ring resonator 13 in capacitive coupling, a
phase-shifting circuit 17 coupled to a coupling point C and a 
coupling point D of the ring resonator 13, a first coupling
capacitor 18 for coupling a connecting terminal 20 of the
phase-shifting circuit 17 to the coupling point C in
capacitive coupling, and a second coupling capacitor 19 for
coupling another
