<ABSTRACT>
An inductive output tetrode includes a cylindrical ceramic envelope 1 within 
which is located an electron gun including a cathode 2 and grid 3. A resonant input cavity 

surrounds the envelope 1 and is located adjacent the electron gun so as to provide a 
modulating electric field in the cathode-grid region during operation to produce density 

modulation of the electron beam. The cavity 7 is connected to two metal cylinders 10 and 
14 arranged immediately adjacent to the outside of the envelope 1. Metallic portions 12 and 

15 located within the envelope 1 are co-extensive with cylinders 10 and 14 with the material 
of the envelope 1 being located between them. These act as r.f. chokes to reduce high 

frequency losses from the cavity 7. Tuning of the resonant cavity may be achieved by 
adjusting a tuning member 8 which is at distance of quarter of a wavelength at the resonant 

frequency from the cathode-grid region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to linear electron beam tube arrangements and more 
particularly to inductive output tetrodes. An inductive output tetrode is an arrangement in which a high frequency input 
signal is applied via a resonant input cavity to the region between the cathode and grid of an 
electron gun. This produces modulation of the electron beam generated by the electron gun. 
The resulting density modulated beam is directed to interact with an output resonant cavity 
from which an amplified high frequency output signal is extracted. DE-A-4 107 552 describes one known type of inductive output tube. The present invention seeks to provide an improved linear electron beam tube 
arrangement. According to the invention there is provided a linear electron beam tube 
arrangement comprising: an electron gun including a cathode and a grid contained within a 
gas tight envelope of dielectric material; a resonant input cavity outside the envelope 
arranged such that a high frequency signal applied thereto results in a modulating electric 
field between the cathode and grid; and choke means arranged to reduce leakage of high 
frequency energy from the cavity comprising metallic co-extensive portions between which 
is located part of the envelope. The co-extensive portions may be of substantially the same 
length, but one portion may be of greater overall longitudinal extent than that with which it 
is co-extensive.  
 By employing the invention, a particularly compact arrangement is possible as the 
envelope material itself forms part of the choke means, resulting in a relatively small overall 
diameter. Thus, losses of high frequency energy may be reduced without the need for 
completely discrete choke components and the additional volume that these would require 
for their accommodation. The reduced diameter of a tube arrangement in accordance with 
the invention is advantageous as it facilitates handling and installation of the arrangement. Tuning of resonant cavities is typically accomplished by including a moveable 
tuning member within the cavity which is spaced from the cathode-grid region by an 
integral odd number of one quarter wavelengths of the resonant frequency. The tuning 
member is usually located at a distance of three quarters of the wavelength or five quarters 
of the wavelength. The reduced diameter of the envelope also has the advantage that 
tuning of the resonant frequency of the cavity may be implemented by locating a movable 
tuning member one quarter of a wavelength at the resonant
