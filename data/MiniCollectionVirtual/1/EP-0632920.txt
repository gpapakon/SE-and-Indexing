<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dynamic focalization method as well as to a therapy apparatus (10) for implementation. The therapy apparatus (10) comprises a therapy device (20) including at least an ultrasonic therapeutic transducer element (221-230) and a signal generator (50) delivering an electronic signal to said ultrasonic transducer element (221-230), characterized in that the signal generator (50) delivers an electronic signal whose self-correlation function is of the DIRAC type. The invention provides for a dynamic electronic focalization without appearance of secondary focal areas.

A method for dynamic electronic focusing of at least one
therapy ultrasound piezoelectric transducer element (221-230),

eliminating or minimising secondary focusing, comprising
activating the ultrasound transducer element by an electronic

signal supplied by a signal generator, characterised in that a
signal generator (50) is employed that delivers an electronic

signal the self-correlation function of which is of the Dirac

type.
The method of claim 1, characterised in that the signal
generator (50) supplied an electronic signal having a Dirac type

self-correlation function which is used for phase-or frequency-modulating
an electronic signal the carrier frequency of which

corresponds to the nominal operating frequency of the transducer
element.
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
signal generator supplies a binary-type electronic signal having

a self-correlation function of the Dirac type.
The method of claim 1,2 or 3, characterised in that the
signal generator supplies a random Gaussian- or Poissonian-type

electronic signal.
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the
signal generator supplies a frequency- or phase-modulated

electronic signal.
The method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised
in that the signal generator supplies a Golay-coded pseudo-random

electronic signal. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the
signal generator supplies a pseudo-random Barker-coded electronic

signal.
The method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the signal generator (50) supplies a

pseudo-random type coded electronic signal of a sequence M;
preferably having an elementary pulse duration Θ comprised

between 0.1 µs and 100 µs, ideally of a value twice to 10 times
the period of oscillation of the transducer, and a repetition

period T comprised between 1 µs and 10 seconds.
Therapy apparatus comprising an actual therapy device
comprising at least one ultrasound therapy transducer element

(221- 230) and a signal generator (50) supplying an electronic
signal to said ultrasound transducer element, characterised in

that the signal generator suppliers an electronic signal the
self-correlation function of which is of the Dirac type.
The apparatus according to claim 9, characterised in
that the signal generator (50) supplies a random signal of the

Gaussian or Poissonian type or a frequency-or phase-modulated
signal.
The apparatus according to claim 10, characterised in
that the signal generator (50) supplies a pseudo-random signal

coded with a sequence M, preferably having an elementary pulse
duration Θ comprised between 0.1 µs and 100 µs, ideally a value

twice to 10 times the period of oscillation of the transducer,

spherical cup (221 sub-divided into an annular array, or a
mosaic, of piezoelectric transducer elements (221-230) , each

transducer element (221 to 230) being advantageously connected,
via individual amplifiers such as 301 to 310 and delay lines

(401 - 410), to the signal generator (50) which is preferably
itself commanded by a control unit (60) which can also command

the delay lines (401 to 410) by supplying the delay value needed
by each line in order to obtain a distant focusing of the desired

focus.
