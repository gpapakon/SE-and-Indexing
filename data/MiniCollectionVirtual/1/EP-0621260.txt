<ABSTRACT>
4-Amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-(β-hydroxyethyl)-aniline 
sulfate which is used particularly as a 

developer for color photography can be easily produced 
in high yield and high quality by nitrosating N-ethyl-N-(β-hydroxyethyl)-m-toluidine 

by use of an alkyl nitrite 
in a homogeneous alcohol solution containing sulfuric 

acid in an amount of about 0.5 to about 1 mole per mole 
of N-ethyl-N-(β-hydroxyethyl)-m-toluidine, and then 

reducing the nitrosation product in an aqueous alcohol 
solution after or without isolation of the nitrosation 

product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for 
producing 4-amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-(β-hydroxyethyl)aniline 
sulfate which is used not only as an intermediate 
of various azo dyes, medicines, agrochemicals, 
etc. but also particularly as a developer for color 
photography. As processes for synthesizing a p-phenylenediamine 
derivative from an aniline derivative through a 
corresponding nitrosation product of the aniline 
derivative, there are known, for example, a process of 
reacting sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid with an 
aniline derivative in water as solvent to obtain a p-nitrosoaniline 
derivative, followed by reducing this 
derivative [for example, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 73, 3100 
(1951)], and a process of reacting an alkyl nitrite with 
an aniline derivative in an aqueous acid suspension, 
followed by reducing the thus obtained nitroso compound 
without isolation [USP 4,474,987 (Japanese Patent 
Examined Publication No. 63-53981)]. The former 
process, however, requires unavoidably a troublesome 
purification procedure for removal of various by-products 
because of side reactions during the nitrosation, 
and gives an insufficient yield. On the other 
hand, the latter process is superior to the former  
 
process in the quality and yield of the product but has 
various defects, for example, in that the nitrosation 
reaction by use of the alkyl nitrite is carried out in a 
heterogeneous system because alkyl nitrites are almost 
insoluble in water which is used as a solvent, and a 
large portion of the water used as solvent should be 
distilled off, because a finally desired acid salt of 
the p-phenylenediamine derivative is highly water-soluble, 
resulting in a low work-efficiency. Further, 
since water alone is used as a solvent in the catalytic 
reduction of nitrosation product, hydrogen absorption 
efficiency is poor and a relatively long time is 
required for the catalytic reduction. As described above, the conventional processes 
comprising nitrosation of an aniline derivative at the 
p-position followed by reduction involve, for example, 
the following problems: i) a troublesome purification 
procedure is necessary because of side reactions 
occurred during the nitrosation, ii) the nitrosation 
reaction does not proceeds smoothly owing to a 
heterogeneous reaction system, iii) a long time is 
required for removing water used as a solvent. All of 
these problems cause a cost-increase when the processes 
are put to practical use. Therefore, a more practical 
production process free from the above
