<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of forming, on a substrate, first metallic regions (M1-1, M1-2) of a first thickness, and second metallic regions (M1-10/M2-10) of a second thickness greater than the first thickness, comprising the steps consisting in depositing a first metallic layer (2) of the first thickness; depositing a layer (11) of a material which can be etched selectively with respect to the metal; photoetching the said material along the contour of the first regions; depositing a second metallic layer (7); forming a masking layer (14) along the contour of the second regions; etching the first and second metallic layers.

A method for forming on a substrate first metal
regions (M1-1, M1-2) of a first thickness, and second

metal regions (M1-10, M2-10) of a second thickness
greater than the first thickness, including the following

steps:

depositing a first metal layer (2) of a first thickness
on the substrate;
depositing a layer (11) of a material selectively
etchable with respect to the metal above the first metal

layer;

photoetching said material along the outline of the
first regions;
depositing a second metal layer (7) above the first
metal layer and said material;
forming a masking layer (14) along the outline of the
second regions; and
etching said first and second metal layers;
whereby there remain first layers of a first thickness at
the places coated with said material and second regions

of a second thickness corresponding to the superposition
of the first and second metal layers at the places coated

with said masking layer.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the
metal is etched through reactive ionic etching.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that said
material is SiO
2
.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that said
material is tungsten.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the
composition of each metal layer is selected from among

the group of materials including Al, Al-Ti, Al-Cu, Al-Si,
Al-Ti-Si and Al-Cu-Si. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the
second metal layer (7) is thicker than the first layer

(2).
The method of claim 6, characterized in that the
first metal layer has a thickness smaller than 1 µm.
The method of claim 6, characterized in that the
second metal layer has a thickness of approximately 2 to

3 µm.
