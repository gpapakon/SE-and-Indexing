<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for synchronising the samples, which follow one another at a low sampling rate (CLKN), of a data stream converted from a high sampling rate (CLKM) to the low sampling rate (CLKN), represented as a sequence of samples of a signal, with a first synchronisation signal (SM) contained in the data stream present with the high sampling rate (CLKM), with a memory (1) which can be loaded and read out cyclically with equidirectional address sequence, which can be provided, on the one hand, with write address signals (at 8), from a write address counter (5) which counts the periods of a first sampling clock signal (CLKM) having the high sampling rate, for loading the samples of the data stream with the high sampling rate (CLKM), and which can be supplied, on the other hand, with read address signals (at 12) for reading out the samples of the data stream with the same high sampling rate (CLKM) from a logic circuit (13), in which the read address signals (at 12) can be generated from an additive logic operation on the write address signals (at 8) and a difference address signal (DEL), and with an arrangement (17, 21, 28) for forming the difference address signal (DEL), provides for synchronisation in the case of a sampling rate conversion without jumps in the synchronisation signal of the low sampling rate and thus without disturbance in the sequence of the samples in that the arrangement (17, 21, 28) for forming the difference address signal comprises a modulo counter (17) for counting the periods of the first sampling clock signal (CLKM), a first sample- and hold circuit (21) for storing the count (PHI) of the modulo counter (17) when the first synchronisation signal (SM) occurs, and an allocation circuit (28) which can be supplied with the count (PHI) stored in the first sample- and hold circuit (21) and by which a value of the difference address signal (DEL) can be output for each of these counts (PHI), the write address counter (5) exhibiting a greater modulus (S) than the modulo counter (17) and the modulus (P) of the modulo counter (17) corresponding to the even-numbered ratio between the high sampling rate (CLKM) and the low sampling rate (CLKN), in that a decoding circuit (23) is provided for outputting a second sampling clock signal (CLKN) exhibiting the low sampling rate at every time at which the modulo counter (17) assumes a basic state (PHI = 0), and in that a second sample- and hold circuit (30) is provided for storing a sample read out of the memory (1) with the read address signal (at 12) at the time of the occurrence of the second sampling clock signal (CLKN) and outputting the samples thus stored as data stream (DN, SN) converted to the low sampling rate (CLKN).
