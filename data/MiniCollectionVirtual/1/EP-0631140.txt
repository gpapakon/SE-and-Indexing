<ABSTRACT>
Rolling bearing with integrated data sensor, which has a fixed ring (1), a rotating ring (2), rolling bodies (3) in contact with the said rings (1, 2), an encoding means (9) mounted on the rotating ring (2), a seal (5) mounted on the fixed ring (1), a sensor means (6) carried by the said seal (5) and a protective sleeve (7) for the cable (8), solidly attached to the said seal (5), characterised in that the sleeve (7) has a groove (20) for receiving the sensor means (6) connected to the cable (8) and in that the said sleeve (7) has an end wall substantially perpendicular to the outer face of the seal (5), through which the cable (8) emerges so that the latter is tangent to the said outer face of the seal (5).

<CLAIMS>
A bearing with an integrated data sensor which has a fixed ring (1), a
rotating ring (2), rolling bodies (3) in contact with said rings (1. 2), an

encoding means (9) mounted on the rotating ring (2), a gasket (5)
mounted on the fixed ring (1), a sensor means (6) carried by said gasket

(5) and a sleeve (7) for protecting the cable (8) integral with said gasket
(5), characterised by the fact that the sleeve (7) is provided with a throat

(20) for receiving the sensor means (6) connected to the cable (8) and
that said sleeve (7) is provided with an end wall (71) substantially

perpendicular to the exterior frontal face (51) of the gasket (5), across
which the cable (8) comes out substantially in the plane of said exterior

frontal face (51) of the gasket (5), with which it is kept in contact by
means (24) arranged on said frontal face (51).
Bearing according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the end walls
(71, 72) of the sleeve (7) along the exterior face (51) of the gasket (5)

are angularly offset.
Bearing according to any one of claims 1 or 2, characterised by the fact
that the section of the cable (8) is rectangular in a manner known per se,

and that the conductors thereof are distributed along one side of the
rectangle defined by said section.
