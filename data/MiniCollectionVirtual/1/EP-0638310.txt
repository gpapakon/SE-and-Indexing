<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
pharmaceutical composition, preferably in the form of 
a tablet or capsule, which includes as a medicament, 
a salt form of a weakly acidic drug, such as the 
sodium salt of BMS 180,291(ifetroban), which composition 
has good dissolution properties even on aging. Solubility of a drug is important with respect 
to drug dissolution rate from a solid dosage form and 
subsequent bioavailability for systemic absorption. Where the free acid form of weakly acidic 
drugs have poor water-solubility, it has been the 
practice to employ such drugs in the form of their 
water-soluble salts. The water-soluble salts will 
generally have good dissolution properties and 
acceptable bioavailability characteristics. BMS 180,291, a thromboxane A₂ receptor 
antagonist, disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,100,889 to 
Misra et al, has the formula  and the name [1S-(1α,2α,3α,4α)]-2-[[3-[4-[(pentylamino) 
carbonyl] -2-oxazolyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]methyl]benzenepropanoic 
acid or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof such as its sodium salt, 
potassium salt, calcium salt or magnesium salt. For matter of convenience, BMS 180,291 will 
hereinafter be referred to as "ifetroban". In its free acid form, ifetroban is poorly 
water-soluble (ca. 7 mcg/mL). The sodium salt of 
ifetroban is freely soluble in water (> 450 mg/mL) 
with excellent chemical and physical stability. 
Initially, capsule and tablet compositions of the 
sodium salt of ifetroban exhibit good chemical 
stability and rapid dissolution rate. However, upon 
storage for two weeks at 30°C, the dissolution rate 
of these compositions slow down dramatically. This 
is indeed surprising in view of the excellent 
chemical stability and high water-solubility of the 
sodium salt of ifetroban. In fact, it has been found 
that the sodium salt of ifetroban upon aging, 
undergoes an acid-base reaction resulting in 
formation of the free acid form of ifetroban which 
results in the dissolution rate slowdown.  In accordance with the present invention, a 
pharmaceutical composition is provided which has 
excellent dissolution properties after aging though 
it may include a medicament which even in its water-soluble 
salt form may have poor dissolution 
properties upon aging. The pharmaceutical composition of the 
invention, which is preferably in the form of a 
tablet or capsule, includes a medicament in the form 
of a water-soluble salt, which could under acidic or 
near neutral conditions convert to its poorly water-soluble 
free acid
