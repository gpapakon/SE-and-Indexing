<DESCRIPTION>
 DETERMINATION OF KINEMATICALLY CONSTRAINED MULTI-ARTICULATED STRUCTURESINTRODUCTIONAbsolute position sensing means has existed for a number of years. In particular, an absolute position sensing technology based on electromagnetic (E/M) sensing has been commercially available since the mid 1970"s and comprises two sets of three orthogonally wound coils. One set of three coils is used as the E M transmitter (Tx) while the other set of three coils is used as the receiver (Rx). One manufacturer of such an E M system, Polhemus, Inc., drives each of the transmitter coils sequentially at a known frequency, while another manufacturer, Ascension Technology Corp., drives each transmitter coil in pulsed mode. Each receiver coil acts as an antenna and picks up the transmitted E/M signal. Mathematically speaking, driving the coils in this manner produces data for 9 equations (1 equation for each transmitter/receiver coil pair), where there are only 6 unknowns (x, y, z, azimuth, elevation and roll). The 6 unknowns can be determined, to the extent that the sensor may lie in either of two transmitter coil hemispheres.FIG. 1 shows the configuration of a Polhemus E/M sensing system with 4 Rx's and 1 Tx. The Rx's 100 and the Tx 101, along with the power supply 103 and a communication cable to the computer 104 are connected to the electronics unit 102. The electronic unit sequences and generates the signal transmitted by the Tx and then amplifies, digitizes and otherwise processes the signal received by the Rx's.There is substantial interest in identifying the spatial placement of various human body-parts in an economic and efficient manner. Up to now no one has accomplished this goal. In the subject application a variety of economical and efficient solutions are provided.There are a number of intriguing applications which require sensing the spatial placement of various body parts, including sensing of the spatial placement of all body parts simultaneously by a single sensing system. Important applications utilizing measurement of human motion input include: medical hand-evaluation systems to measure post-operative improvement in range of joint movement, or to measure dynamic movement capability of various hand joints; character animation using a hand/body position measurement device to generate a control signal for a graphical marionette or an entire graphical cartoon capable of anthropomorphic movement; human factors/performance evaluation which might, for example, allow simulation of a person getting in/out of a car

A is one of: (1) at least one fingertip of the fingers and the distal phalanx of the thumb, or (2) the medial phalanx of at least one finger and the proximal phalanx of the thumb or (3) the distal phalanx of the thumb or (4) the proximal phalanx of the thumb, and for (2) said sensing elements further including goniometers for disposition over the distal interphalangeal joints of said at least one finger, and for (3) said sensing elements further including goniometers on the metacarpophalangeal joint and at least the proximal interphalangeal joint of at least one finger, and for (4) said sensing elements further including goniometers on the thumb interphalangeal joint, and the metacarpophalangeal joint and at least the proximal interphalangeal joint of at least one finger, wherein each of said goniometers produces a second signal, and wherein the choice of (1) or (2) may vary by finger; and
B is one of: (5) the dorsal side of the metacarpus and the forearm in proximity to the wrist, or (6) the dorsal side of the metacarpus or (7) the forearm in proximity to the wrist, where (6) and (7) further include two goniometers for disposition on said wrist, wherein one of said goniometers measures flexion/extension and the other measures abduction/adduction;
0 or 1 position-sensing element attached to a reference location, wherein said position-sensing elements include at least one transmitter and at least one receiver; a first data processing means for driving said transmitters to produce said first signal and amplifying said first signals received by said receivers; said first data processing means also capable of amplifying said second signal from said goniometers; a second data processing means utilizing said amplified first and second signals for calculating the spatial placement of said sensing elements, and utilizing the structure of the links, and said placement of each said sensing element in said juxtaposition to each said link, for calculating the spatial placement of said links to produce said measured links; a third data processing means for determining the spatial placement of at least one link other than a measured link of said hand and wrist utilizing the spatial placement of said measured links and the kinematic constraints of the articulated elements of said hand and wrist.
