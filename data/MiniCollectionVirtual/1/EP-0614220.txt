An electrical interconnection medium having first (50-53) and 
second (54-57) 

interconnection layers, each interconnection layer including parallel 
conductors, the conductors of the first and second interconnection layers being 

oriented orthogonal to each other, the conductors being interconnected so as 
to form substantially interdigitated power distribution planes on each layer, 

each plane appearing on both layers. The interconnection medium 
advantageously is employed as a multichip module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to integrated circuit chips and media
for interconnecting same. More particularly, the invention relates to
assemblies known as multichip modules (MCM) wherein unpackaged
integrated circuit chips can be mounted on and wired to a substrate
containing multiple patterned metal levels for power distribution and signal
interconnection.An MCM generally comprises a substrate on which are formed
patterned conductive regions for the interconnection of circuit components,
usually integrated circuit chips. The conductive regions are usually made of
metal and formed in multiple levels, referred to herein as metal or
interconnection levels or layers.It is known that a substrate of an MCM can be fabricated of a variety
of materials such as silicon, ceramic (for example, alumina), glass, or metal
(for example, aluminum). It is also known that an interconnection level or
layer can be formed on the substrate by dispositing, sputtering, evaporating,
in combination sputtering and plating, or by some other technique a
conductive region on a given layer. The conductive region then can be
patterned into signal and power distribution conductors by photolithographic
techniques combined with etching of selective plating. Multiple
interconnection levels or layers can be formed so long as suitable interposing
insulating layers are provided. Interposing levels of insulating dielectric, i.e., insulating layers disposed
between interconnection layers, can be applied by spinning, in the case of
polymers, or chemical or physical vapor deposition, in the case of organics
such as silicon dioxide. Holes (vias) patterned in these insulating layers by
photolithography and wet or dry etching techniques allow interconnection
from one level of metal to another.An MCM substrate provides an interconnection medium for a plurality
of chips that is more advantageous than, for example, printed circuit boards
to which are mounted individually packaged chips, because it dramatically
reduces the distance required for signals to travel between chips, and thus the
time delay for inter-chip signal propagation. As integrated signal technology
has continued to advance higher circuit speeds, this interconnection delay has
become a major limitation on system performance, and thus has increased the
importance of MCMs as interconnection media.Also, for electronic systems, the use of an MCM and unpackaged chips
advantageously results in far greater packing density of chips, and thus
reduced system size.A disadvantage of present
