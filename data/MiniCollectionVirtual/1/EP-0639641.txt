<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new 
Streptococcus 
thermophilus
 strains containing genes giving 
the bioluminescence property. The strains 

can be applied widely for analytical 
purposes, e.g. in the determination of 

bacteriophages and antibiotics, especially 
from liquid samples. The invention also 

relates to a test set containing a 
bioluminescent 
Streptococcus thermophilus
 
strain, and to processes for the determination 

of bacteriophages or antibiotics from a 
liquid sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new Streptococcus 
thermophilus strains containing genes giving the bioluminescence 
property. The new bioluminescent Streptococcus 
thermophilus strains are very useful tools for 
various analytical purposes. The strains are suitable 
e.g. for use in the determination of bacteriophages 
and antibiotics, particularly from liquid samples. The 
invention also relates to a test set containing a 
bioluminescent Streptococcus thermophilus strain, and 
to processes for determining bacteriophages and antibiotics 
in liquid samples. In many situations it is of vital importance to 
be able to detect the presence of small amounts of 
antibiotics. This is the case in food industries, for 
instance, where the increased use of antibiotics and 
chemotherapeutic substances in the treatment of 
animals has created a need for a simple, reliable and 
sensitive process of determination. Since antibiotics 
are also used in the treatment of dairy cows and since 
antibiotic residues in milk may both cause health 
hazards and be disadvantageous for food technological 
reasons, it is especially important to develop processes 
suitable for an accurate and rapid screening of 
milk. Antibiotic residues in milk are generally detected 
by microbiological processes which utilize the 
ability of bacteria to produce acid, reduce colours 
and produce growth on an agar medium. These processes 
are based on the bactericidal, inhibitory and morphological 
effect of antibiotics on certain microorganisms. The Thermocult disk technique is an agar diffusion 
technique which is widely used in Finland and  
 
accepted as an official antibiotic determination 
procedure. In this technique the test organism is 
B. stearothermophilus var. calidolactis. It has been 
developed on the basis of an IDF standard process (IDF 
1970. Detection of Penicillin in Milk by a Disk Assay 
Technique. International Standard FIL-IDF 57. Brussels). A process of corresponding sensitivity is disclosed 
by van OS et al., Diffusion Test for the Determination 
of Antibiotic Residues in Milk. Neth. Milk 
and Dairy J. 29 (1975) 16. The Delvotest process also 
uses B. stearothermophilus var. calidolactis as the 
test organism. A sample (0.1 ml) is pipetted on agar 
contained in a vial, and a tablet containing nutrients 
and a pH indicator is added to the vial. The process 
is based on the acid producing capability of the test 
organism. The vials are incubated at 64°C for 2.5 
hours. The evaluation is based on the colour change of 
the agar layer.
