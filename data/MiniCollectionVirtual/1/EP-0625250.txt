<ABSTRACT>
A double seat valve has two serially arranged closure members that are movable with respect to each other, that prevent in the closed position of the valve fluids from overflowing from one part (1a) into another part (1b) of the valve housing and that delimit both in the closed and in the open position of the valve a leakage cavity (3). The valve rods (5a, 6a) for the closure members (5, 6) are concentrically arranged inside each other and unilaterally extend out of one part of the valve housing into the surroundings of the valve. The disclosed double seat valve satisfies the requirement for a leakage cavity that can not only be drained, but also pressure-relieved in all imaginable operating conditions. For that purpose, the valve rod of the second closure member (6) designed as a hollow rod (6a) inwardly delimits a part (6d) of a connection path (15) which is enlarged up to a throughflow cross-section (Q) immediately after the leakage cavity (3) and in a part of its ulterior course, thus increasing the space available for the leakage cavity (3).

A double seat valve with two serially mounted closure 
elements (5, 6) movable relative to each other which 

prevent overflow of fluids from a first valve housing 
element (1a) to a second (1b) when the valve is in the 

closed position and which in both the closed and the 
open position delimit a leakage cavity (3) having a 

connection path (15) to the environment of the valve, 
with the one, the first closure element (5) being 

actuated independently which during its opening 
movement comes to rest against the other, the second 

closure element (6) and also transfers the latter to 
the open position, and with valve rods (5a, 6a) which 

are mounted concentrically one within the other for the 
closure elements (5, 6) and which extend through and 

beyond one of the valve housing elements (1a, 1b) on 
one side with the valve rod (6a) of the second closure 

element (6) being designed as a hollow rod, 
wherein
 
this hollow rod (6a) has on the inside a reservoir (6d) 

immediately adjoining the leakage cavity (3) and 
increases the latter by the amount of its storage 

volume beyond the extent mechanically necessary for the 
combined action of the closure elements (5, 6), the 

cross section of the leakage cavity (3) being continued 
more or less with the same diameter in an aperture 

cross-section (Q) of the reservoir (6d).

 the 
aperture cross section (Q) is so dimensioned that its 

value (Qmax) approaches as closely as possible that of

valve (Qmax â‰¤ N) or if possible exceeds this value.  
 
A double seat valve as recited in Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein

leakage cavity (3) is connected to the environment of 
the valve by means of a connecting path (15).

wherein
 
the connecting path (15) is closable to the environment 

side. 
A double seat valve as recited in Claim 5, 
wherein

closure can be actuated as a function of the storage 

volume occupied by liquid. 
A double seat valve as recited in one of Claims 3 to 6, 

wherein
 the end of the hollow rod (6a) facing away from 
the closure element (6) is connected to a housing (4*) 

which continues the reservoir (6d) and the adjoining 
connecting path (15) formed by the hollow rod (6a) from 

the area between the second valve housing element (1b) 
and the valve drive on the side of the double seat 

valve. 
A double seat valve as recited in one of Claims 3 to 6, 

wherein
 the hollow rod (6a) extends movably into an 
inner space (4a) of a first housing (4) that is 

connected to the second valve housing element (1b) 
through which the hollow rod (6a) extends. 
A double seat valve as recited in one of Claims 1 to 8, 

wherein
 inside or adjacent to the hollow rod (6a) is  
 

provided an inner hollow rod (6b) rigidly connected to 
the hollow rod (6a) that in opening direction of the 

valve rests indirectly on the valve rod (5a) of the 
first closure element (5). 
A double seat valve as recited in Claim 9, 
wherein
 the 
inner hollow rod (6b) extends into the valve drive. 
A double seat valve as recited in claims 9 or 10, 

wherein
 the inner hollow rod (6b) extends to the 
leakage cavity (3) and forms an annular gap (6e) 

together with the valve rod (5a) which it surrounds. 
A double seat valve as recited in Claim 11, 
wherein
 the 
annular gap (6e) on one side ends in the leakage cavity
