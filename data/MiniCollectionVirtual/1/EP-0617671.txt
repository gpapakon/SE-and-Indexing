<ABSTRACT>
A sheet holder includes a slide (6, 8) slidable along each end of a track (4) extending along the width of the upper end of a backing member (2), and a cord or pair of cords (10, 12) carried by at least one slide and receivable through the openings of a plurality of sheets. The cords include mating connectors (10a, 10b) at one end to permit the sheets to be secured together, while the opposite ends of the cords are secured to a length-varying device (16, 18) enabling the effective lengths of the cords to be varied according to number of sheets to be secured by the cords.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for
holding a plurality of sheets. The invention is
particularly useful as a holder for holding computer
printout sheets, and is therefore described below with
respect to this application.Computer printout sheets represent a widely used
means for presenting all kinds of data. As increasing
amounts of such data accumulate and storage space becomes
more expensive, there is an increasing need for filing
systems employing holders that are capable of providing
efficient paper storage while taking up a minimum of space.A number of sheet-holder systems have been
described, for example, in US Patents 1,004,777, 1,644,541,
and 4,775,257, in EP-A-219 775, and in British Patent No.802,577, which
employ flexible cords for securing the stack of sheets
within the holder. However, none of the devices described
can efficiently and compactly hold various numbers of
sheets having different arrangements of perforations, and
permit the sheet holding capacity to be increased or
decreased as may be required.According to the present invention, there is
provided a holder as claimed in claim 1.According to further features in the preferred
embodiments of the invention described below, a common
movable member is slidable along a track extending at the 
upper end of the backing member along its width. The mentioned cord means may be constituted of one
cord whose opposite ends terminate in the mating connectors;
alternatively, the cord means may include a pair of chords
having one of their ends terminating in the mating
connectors.Several embodiments of the invention are described
below for purposes of example. In one described embodiment,
the length-varying device comprises two fabric strips of a
hook-and-loop fastener, e.g., a "Velcro" (Reg. T.M.)
fastener. One fabric strip of the hook-and-loop fastener is
secured to the opposite end of the cord means, and the other
fabric strip of the fastener is fixed to and extending along
the respective axis (e.g., width) of the backing member. In
a second described embodiment, the length-varying device
comprises a reel secured to and slidable with the slide.In all the described preferred embodiments, there
are two of the cord means carried by two slides movably
mounted to the opposite sides of the backing member.Holders constructed in accordance with the
foregoing features enable the user to freely adjust the cord
spacings and cord lengths as desired, and thereby to store
all kinds of sheets securely, to retrieve any specific sheet
efficiently, and

<CLAIMS>
A holder for holding a plurality of sheets formed with alignable holes,
said holder comprising: a backing member (2; 102); and cord means (10, 12; 110,

112) terminating in a pair of mating connectors (10a, 10b, 12a, 12b; 110a, 110b,
112a, 112b) connectible together after having been passed through the holes of

said sheets to secure the sheets together; characterized in that said cord means
has an opposite end secured to a length-varying device (16, 18; 116, 118)

enabling the length of the cord means to be varied according to the number of
sheets to be secured by the cord means.
The holder according to claim 1, wherein said length-varying device
comprises a reel (116, 118).
The holder according to claim 1, wherein said length-varying device
comprises two fabric strips of a hook-and-loop fastener, one fabric strip (16; 18)

of said hook-and-loop fastener being secured to said opposite end of the cord
means, the other fabric strip (14) of the hook-and-loop fastener being fixed to and

extending along the backing member (2; 102).
The holder of claim 1 characterized in that said cord means are carried
by at least one common movable member (6, 8; 106, 108) movable along one

axis of the backing member for locating said cord means at any desired location
along said axis to align said cord means with respect to the holes of the sheets to

be secured together. 
The holder according to claim 4, wherein said common movable
member (6, 8; 106, 108) is slidable along a track (4; 104) extending at one end of

the backing member (2; 102) along its width.
The holder according to claim 1, wherein said length-varying device
comprises two fabric strips of a hook-and-loop fastener, one fabric strip (16; 18)

of said hook-and-loop fastener being secured to said opposite end of the cord
means, the other fabric strip (14) of the hook-and-loop fastener being fixed to and

extending along the respective axis of the backing member (2; 102).
The holder according to claim 1, wherein said length-varying device

comprises a reel (116, 118) to which said opposite end of the cord means is
secured.
The holder according to claim 7, wherein said reel (116, 118) is
slidable on a track (104).
The holder according to claim 1, wherein said cord means are
constituted of two separate cords (10, 12; 110, 112) each having one end

terminating in one of said mating connectors (10a, 10b, 12a, 12b; 110a, 110b,
112a, 112b).
The holder according to claim 1, wherein said cord means are
constituted of a single cord (10, 12; 110, 112) whose opposite ends terminate in

said mating connectors (10a, 10b, 12a, 12b; 110a, 110b, 112a, 112b).
The holder according to claim 4, wherein there are two or more of said cord
means (10, 12; 110, 112), each having at one end two lengths of cords

terminating in a pair of said mating connectors and carried by said movable
member (6, 8; 106, 108) at one of the opposite sides of the backing member (2;
