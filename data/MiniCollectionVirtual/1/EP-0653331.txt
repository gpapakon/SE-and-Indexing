<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speaker apparatus
for use in an automobile vehicle.A speaker apparatus for use in an automobile vehicle
is usually limited in its size because of various
restriction while being installed in a vehicle. In addition,
since a speaker apparatus is used in a vehicle usually
under a severe condition in which heat resistance, light
resistance, and water resistance are required, it is
extremely important to design a proper structure and
select an appropriate material for making such speaker
apparatus. Further, with an increasingly improved quality
in a program source, people began to demand a
higher and higher audio quality on a speaker apparatus.In prior art, a speaker apparatus is usually positioned
near a dashboard, or installed on a door or on a
rear parcel tray inside an automobile vehicle. However,
in a position such as that near the dashboard, since an
area possible for installing the speaker unit is narrow
and has many clearance gaps, it is difficult to obtain a
perfect reproduction of an audio signal having a low frequency.On the other hand, if a door of a vehicle is selected
to be used as a position to install the speaker apparatus,
such a location is favourable for reproducing an
audio signal having a low frequency since the door usually
has an interior volume of about 30 liters. But, the
front lower portion of a vehicle door is apt to cause a
large peak dip when an audio signal is in its middle level
frequency, due to an interference of a primarily reflected
sound which is caused when a direct original sound is
reflected by the floor of a vehicle room. Moreover, since
there is usually a difference between left side distance
and right side distance, i.e. distances measured on left
and right sides respectively from a position where a listener
sits to a position where a speaker is located, it is
difficult to obtain an adequate stereo effect.In order to properly install a speaker apparatus in
an automobile vehicle, Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open 4-5141 has disclosed a speaker apparatus
as shown in Fig. 7. Referring to Fig. 7, the speaker
apparatus comprises a spiral-shaped duct section 4
integrally formed with a speaker unit 5 and positioned in
a rear space of an automobile vehicle, said spiral-shaped
duct section 4 including a spiral-shaped duct 6
extending from the front portion of the speaker unit 5, an
elongated duct 7 communicating with the spiral-shaped
duct section 4 and extending to a front area of the vehicle,
a sound emitting section 8 communicating
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
