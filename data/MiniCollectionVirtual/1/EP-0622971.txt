<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a loudspeaker
structure and a method of assembling a loudspeaker, for a
loudspeaker of the type that a magnetic circuit
generating a repulsion magnetic field (hereinafter called
"repulsion magnetic circuit") is generated by two magnets
with the same polarity being faced with each other, a
magnetic material plate is interposed therebetween, and a
voice coil is placed in the magnetic field at the outer
peripheral area of the plate.Various types of loudspeakers using a repulsion
magnetic circuit have been proposed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No.56-34298,
Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No.59-48197,
Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No.61-128896,
and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No.1-98400.
The present inventors have proposed
loudspeakers of this type having an improved 
performance.In conventional methods of assembling a repulsion
magnetic circuit, magnets 1 and a plate 2 are bonded and
fixed together as shown in Fig.8A, or magnets 1 and a
plate 2 mounted on a holder 4 are fastened and fixed by a
screw 12 as shown in Fig.8B. In the case of a
conventional loudspeaker proposed by the present
inventors, a support shaft 4a is formed integrally with a
holder 4 and holes of magnetic circuit components are
fitted around the support shaft to fix them by using a
screw or to bond and fix them, as shown in Fig.8C.In a repulsion magnetic circuit, two magnets with
the same polarity being faced with each other are used.
Therefore, during assembling them, the two repulsing
magnets may jump out of a magnetic circuit holding unit.
In order to avoid this, it is necessary to use strong
adhesive agents and bond the components together.
However, this bonding strength is not so much reliable in
practical use.In the case of the method illustrated in Fig.8A, the
lower magnet, plate, and upper magnet are bonded together
in this order and disposed on the upper surface of the
holder 4. However, each component has no structure for
helping align its center. It is
therefore difficult to assemble them. In the screw fastening method illustrated in Fig.8B,
the length of the screw 12 is required to be a length
corresponding to the total thickness of the two magnets 1
and plate 2 plus the length of an internal thread 4d.
Using this long screw makes it difficult to align each
magnetic circuit component at a high precision, and also
poses some problem of the performance of a magnetic
circuit itself. Furthermore, if strong magnets 1 or a
thin plate 2
