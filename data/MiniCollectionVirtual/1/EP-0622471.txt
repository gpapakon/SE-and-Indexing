<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composite materials and, 
more particularly, to a composite material of chromium carbide and 
a solid lubricant especially, but not exclusively, suited for use 
as a high velocity oxy-fuel spray coating. U.S. Patent No. 4,728,448 issued to Sliney discloses a self-lubricating 
composite material comprising chromium carbide and 
solid lubricant particles, wherein the composite material is 
applied to metallic substrates using an air plasma spray 
technique. Air plasma spraying involves the use of a plasma forming gas 
as both a heat source and propelling agent. A high voltage arc 
excites the plasma gas by ionization. The coating powder is 
injected (typically from an external powder port) into the hot 
plasma stream, which melts the powder and deposits it at relatively 
low velocities, e.g., 300-500 ft/sec, onto a substrate. 
Typical parameters for this process involve the use of argon as 
the primary gas and hydrogen as the secondary gas, with typical 
flows of 40 and 25 scfm, respectively. A typical arc current is 
450 to 475 amps. The air plasma spray produces extremely high temperatures 
which partially melt the particles to bond them to the substrate. 
The high temperatures have the negative effect of volatilizing the 
solid lubricant compositions. Accordingly, when high temperature  
 
parameters are used, the chrome carbide is deposited with good 
efficiency, but little or no solid lubricant is retained in the 
coating. When the heat parameters are reduced to retain the solid 
lubricants, the deposition efficiency of the chrome carbide is so 
low that it is not economically feasible to apply it. In an attempt to improve the deposition rate of the coating 
and retention of the solid lubricant, coarse particle sizes can be 
selected for the solid lubricants so that some percentage of solid 
lubricant can be retained. However, the coarseness of the 
particles is detrimental to the friction and wear performance of 
the coating. Features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in 
part in the description which follows, and in part will be 
apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of 
the invention. The objects and other advantages of the invention 
may be realized and attained by the combinations particularly 
pointed out in the written description, claims and appended 
drawings. To achieve these and other advantages, and in accordance with 
the purposes of the invention as embodied and broadly described 
herein, a composite material for
