<ABSTRACT>
A centrifuge for sedimenting fine solid particles comprises a centrifuge drum in which an overflow flange (52) which projects radially inwardly is provided at the upper edge of the peripheral wall (36). At its top the flange is provided with pump wings (80) which follow each other at an irregular angular spacing which preferably varies by +/- 2 DEG  about a mean of 11 DEG .

<CLAIMS>
Centrifuge for separating fine solid particles from
the waste water occurring at a dental workplace, with


a) a casing (16, 42);
b) a centrifuge drum circulating in this, which has:
a cylindrical circumferential wall (36), a bottom

wall (38), which has preferably a discharge
opening (40) leading to a collecting vessel (44),

an overflow flange (52) pointing radially inwards
from the upper edge of the circumferential wall

(36) and limiting an overflow opening (54), which
flange is taken up on its top side with pump

vanes (80);
c) a drive motor (26) operating on the centrifuge
drum (30); and
d) a casing-fixed feed tube for the mixture of solid
particles and liquid to be separated,

characterized in that
e) the pump vanes (80) follow one another at an
irregular angular spacing.
Centrifuge according to claim 1, characterized in that
the angular spacing of consecutive pump vanes (86)

varies irregularly around a mean value, preferably by
+/- 2° around the mean value of 11°.
Centrifuge according to one of claims 1 or 2, the
overflow flange (52) being provided with back pump

vanes (86) hanging down and running in a channel of
the casing (16, 42), characterized in that the back 

pump vanes (86) are formed by sections of an apron
(82) hanging down from the outer edge of the overflow

flange (52) and separated by edge recesses (84).
Centrifuge according to claim 3, characterized in that
the front and rear peripheries (88, 90) of the edge

recesses (84) seen in a circumferential direction are
set obliquely in relation to radial planes

intersecting them and run preferably parallel to one
another, the setting angle being preferably roughly

45°.
Centrifuge according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the back pump vanes (86) and/or the edge recesses

(84) follow one another at an irregular angular
spacing.
Centrifuge according to claim 5, characterized in that
the spacing of the back pump vanes (86) and/or the

spacing of the edge recesses (84) vary irregularly
around a mean value, preferably by +/- 2° around 17°.
Centrifuge according to one of claims 1 to 6, the feed
tube being formed by the lower end of a cyclone wall

(18), which engages with little radial play in the top
end of the guide wall (50) of the centrifuge drum

(30), and an air discharge tube (60) being connected
in a rotationally fixed manner to the centrifuge drum

(30), which tube at the same time forms a circulating
inner wall of the cyclone and is connectable to a

negative pressure source, and a cover (76) closing the
cyclone wall (18) at the upper end being provided with

a locking rib (74), which engages with little play in
recesses (72), which are provided in pump vanes (68)

connected to the top end of the air discharge tube
(60), characterized in that the pump vanes (68) are

arranged on a radial flange (66), which is led with 
little radial play as far as the inner surface of the

cyclone wall (18).
Centrifuge according to claim 7, characterized in that
the underside of the locking flange (66) is taken up

with further pump vanes (70).
