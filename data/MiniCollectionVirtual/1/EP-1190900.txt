<ABSTRACT>
A support unit for partition walls typically for the load compartment of isothermal vans, comprising at least one carriage (3) slidable along a respective longitudinal guide (1) fixed to the roof of the load compartment, and provided with a transverse shaft (13) for supporting and hinging a partition wall (11), which can rotate between two end positions, which are vertical and virtually horizontal; said at least one carriage is provided with a slidable vertical latch which is constantly urged elastically towards a rack carried by the respective guide; between said wall and said latch there is interposed a controlling linkage system of variable geometry which along the two opposite terminal arcs of a complete rotation of the wall is insensitive to the wall movement, whereas along that arc of the rotation extending between the preceding arcs it causes release of the latch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to movable transverse partition walls used in isothermal vans to partition its load compartment into regions for containing different products.Such walls are supported by the roof of the load compartment in such a manner as to occupy two stable positions, in one of which they are disposed vertically in order to partition the load compartment in the stated manner, whereas in the other they are disposed virtually horizontal against said roof, to enable the goods to be handled.For positioning said walls, support units are known comprising at least one longitudinal guide which slidingly supports a carriage from which the wall is suspended. Preferably for each wall there are provided two carriages slidingly supported by respective longitudinal guides which are fixed to the roof of the load compartment. The upper edge of the wall is hinged to said carriages on a horizontal axis lying transversely to the load compartment.Said hinging is achieved by two brackets to be connected to the wall, gas springs being interposed between said brackets and said carriages to facilitate the lifting of the wall towards said virtually horizontal position.Means are also provided to lock the carriages along their guides when the partition wall is in said vertical position and virtually horizontal position.They comprise a holed plate, commonly known as a rack, which is associated with the carriage guide, and a latch which projects from the upper face of the carriage, to be constantly forced towards the rack by rearward-lying elastic thrust means.The latch is hooked to an articulated frame hinged to the carriage and arranged to assume a locking configuration, established by said elastic means, in which the larch makes contact with the rack, and a releasing configuration, determined by the intervention of the operator, in which the thrust of the elastic means is overcome, so that the latch disengages from the rack.With reference to the partition wall, the far end of the frame is hinged to the carriage by a stationary horizontal transverse pin, whereas the near end thereof is connected to the carriage by a horizontal transverse pin which can slide through a certain distance relative to the length of the carriage.Connected to said movable pin there is a flexible tie such as a cord or a tape which extends downwards against the partition wall, where it can be gripped by the operator.By pulling said cord or tape, the operator changes the shape of the frame against the action of the elastic means which act on the

A support unit for partition walls (11) typically for the load compartment of isothermal vans, comprising for each partition wall at least one carriage (3) slidable along a respective longitudinal guide (1) fixed to the roof of the load compartment, and provided with a transverse shaft (13) for supporting and hinging the partition wall (11), which can rotate between two end positions, namely vertical and virtually horizontal respectively, each carriage (3) being provided with a slidable vertical latch (7) which is constantly urged elastically towards a rack (2) carried by the respective longitudinal guide (1), 
characterized in that
 between said partition wall and said latch (7) there is interposed a linkage system (10) which prevents the disengagement of the latch (7) From the rack (2) when the partition wall (11) is at its two end positions, whereas it automatically releases the latch (7) from the rack (2) when the partition wall (11) is moved along its arc of rotation between the two end positions, said linkage system (10) comprising at least one pair of consecutive connecting rods (18, 22) defining a toggle device which is slidable within a guide slot (200) provided in the carriage and carries said latch (7), and which at one end (19) is hinged to the carriage (3) and at its opposite end presents a pin (23) which is guided within a rectilinear slot (24) associated with the carnage (3), and is positioned along the trajectory followed by a release member (250, 251) carried by the partition wall (11) and provided for disengaging the latch (7).
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized by
 comprising a toggle device at each end of the partition wall.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized by
 comprising two release members, one for each end of said slidable terminal pin of the toggle device.
A unit as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said release members are associated with usual brackets (12) provided for hinging the partition wall (11) to the carriage (3).
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said release member is shaped to interfere with said terminal pin (23) by sliding contact.
A unit as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in that
 said release member comprises an arcuate slot (25) which engages the respective end of said pin (23), and which lies concentric to the hinging axis (13) of the partition wall (11) except for a portion generally in the form of a cusp (250) in its central region.
A unit as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 said cusp is positioned, with reference to a complete rotation of the partition wall between said two vertical and virtually horizontal end positions, at an angle of between 55 and 75째.
A unit as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 said arcuate slot subtends an effective angle of at least 90째.
A unit as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the cusp of said arcuate slot subtends an angle of 65째 with that end of the slot distant from the partition wall (11).
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said release member is shaped to interfere with said terminal pin (23) by rolling contact.
A unit as claimed in claim 10, 
characterized in that
 said release member comprises an idle roller (251) the axis of which is parallel to the support and rotation axis of the wall.
A unit as claimed in claim 11, 
characterized in that
 said pin and said roller are dimensioned such that the two make contact after the partition wall (11) during its opening has rotated through about 55째.
A unit as claimed in claim 11, 
characterized in that
 said idle roller is a bearing.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 means are associated with said carriages to enable the latches (7) to be released from the racks (2) when the partition wall (11) is in a vertical position.
A unit as claimed in claim 14, 
characterized in that
 said means comprise two levers (125), one or each carriage, which at one end are hinged to the carriage on a horizontal transverse axis (126), and at their other end (129) rest on the central part of the respective toggle device, said two levers being connected together by a common operating member.
A unit as claimed in claim 15, 
characterized in that
 said two levers (125) are housed in the interior of the carriages (3), from which they emerge lowerly to be connected to said common operating member, such as a transverse rod (128).
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each carriage is lowerly provided with an aperture (111) for the emergence of the rear end of the latch when in the release configuration.
