<ABSTRACT>
This process for making female electrical connectors, including an electrically conducting functional part (1) defining an internal volume intended to receive a male connection, consists in over-moulding the said conducting part (1) after having filled, at least partially, the internal volume. The functional shape of the said metal blades (2, 3) is conferred on them by means of a mould during the over-moulding of the said conducting part. The invention also relates to the female electrical connector obtained by means of this process.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of electrical female
connectors comprising a functional current conductor part

(1) and in particular metal blades (2, 3) defining an
interior volume intended to receive a male connection,

the said current conductor part (1) being encapsulated
after the at least partial filling of the said interior

volume,
characterised in that
 the functional shape of the said
metal blades (2, 3) is conferred on them by the slope of

a mould during the encapsulation of the said current
conductor part.
A method for the production of electrical female
connectors according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the encapsulation is performed by
means of a mould consisting of three parts, respectively

a core (7), intended to come to partially fill the volume
defined by the said current conductor part (1), and two

mould impressions, respectively a lower one (9) and an
upper one (8), having a shape substantially complementary

to that of the core (7), and coming to cooperate
therewith on contact with the said conductive part (1)

during the phase for the injection of plastics material.
A method for the production of the electrical female
connectors according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the core (7) comprises two main
faces provided with two concavities (10, 11), at the

level of which the two metal blades (2, 3), which are
component parts of the metal current conductor part (1),

defining the interior volume are intended to come to be
positioned, 


and in that
 the two mould impressions, a lower one (9)
and an upper one (8) respectively, are domed (14, 15),

the radius of curvature of the said domed portions
roughly corresponding to the radius of curvature of the

concavities of the core (7), in such a manner that they
may cooperate closely with the latter once the metal

blades (2, 3) are in position to confer to the latter
their functional shape.
An electrical female connector mounted at the end of a
current conductor wire and intended to receive a male

connection, and of the type comprising two inwardly
curved (26, 27) opposite metal blades (2, 3), the said

blades (2, 3) being connected to their base (5) at the
level of a zone (6) for crimping the current conductor

wire, the conductor unit thus formed being partially
encapsulated by the plastics material, whilst conserving

the deformation elasticity of the said blades, which are
component parts of the current conductor part, the zones

(24, 25) situated perpendicular to the inwardly curved
portions (26, 27) of the metal blades (2, 3) being devoid

of plastics material, the said connector being

characterised in that
 the two metal blades (2, 3) are in
their inwardly curved parts (26, 27) in contact with one

another in an elastic manner.
An electrical female connector according to Claim 4,

characterised in that
 the zones (24, 25) situated
perpendicular to the curved portions (26, 27) of the

metal blades (2, 3) receive a seal, which does not affect
the elasticity of the said blades.
