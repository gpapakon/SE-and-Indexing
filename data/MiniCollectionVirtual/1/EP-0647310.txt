<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides apparatus for and a method of interferometrically inspecting a surface of an object. The invention is particularly well suited for inspecting semiconductor devices in the sub-micron range. A two beam interference microscope (102) obtains an image of an object (100) which is mounted on a piezo controlled sample table (104) and illuminated using a broadband light source. A CCD camera (100) obtains an image and the image is processed by using information derived from the interference fringes. The advantage is that large step heights can be measured and that a priori knowledge of the surface is not required. The invention can be adapted so that it can be used to simultaneously inspect and analyse an object, the latter being achieved by utilising data derived from a characteristic phase and/or spectral variation occurring in reflected light. This data can be manipulated mathematically e.g. by a Fourier Transform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus 
for interferometrically inspecting a surface of an object. It 
relates more particularly to the submicron metrology of 
semiconductor surfaces and devices which have multi-micron step 
features. The size of the smallest structures in semiconductor 
components is decreasing by about a factor of two every four 
years. During the 1990's it is expected that in microelectronics 
manufacturing the working limit will be well below one micron. 
For example, in high density circuits such as 4Mb SRAMS and 16Mb 
DRAMS, the design rules are already 0.5 µm. Means are being 
sought to make gate lengths of 0.1 µm for silicon MOSFETs 
(Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) to increase 
the operating speed of the transistor. The ability to make measurements and alignments to some tens 
of nanometers is therefore becoming increasingly important. 
Advanced metrology techniques are required capable of measuring 
near to the nanometer scale, not only for research in the 
laboratory but also for routine analysis on the production line. There is now a renewed interest in optical techniques for 
carrying out submicron measurement because of their ease of use, 
the very large capacity for handling data and the potential for 
use on the production line. Despite the resolution of optical 
microscopes being limited to around 0.5 µm in visible light, with 
the addition of digital image processing and the clever use of 
various additional techniques it is now possible to make 
nanometer detection and measurement. For instance, incoherent 
broadband illumination techniques combined with image processing 
to analyse the optical effects of line structures are now capable 
of giving line width measurement to an accuracy of 10 nm. As an 
example, Phase Shifting Microscopy (PSM) is a mature technique 
which is capable of yielding, in the vertical direction,  
 
nanometer and even angstrom surface shape analysis, particularly 
useful in roughness analysis and the contouring of optical 
components with gentle surface slopes (see K. Creath, "Phase 
measurement interferometry techniques", Progress in Optics, Ed. 
E. Wolf, Ch.V, 351-393, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1988). 
However, it has been found that PSM has certain limitations in 
semiconductor work, where step heights are normally multi-micron, 
far greater than the spacing of the interference fringes. 
Because of the periodicity of the fringes, determination of such 
step heights introduces problems in phase
