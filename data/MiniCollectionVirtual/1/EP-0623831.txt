<ABSTRACT>
We have discovered that the strength of arc fusion splices in optical 
fiber can be adversely affected by particles (e.g., SiO₂ particles) from the electrodes. 

Disclosed is a method of arc fusion splicing that can substantially increase the 
probability that a given fiber splice will meet a given strength requirement. The 

method comprises initiating the arc in a "cleaning" position selected such that the 
probability of incidence on the fibers of particles from the electrodes is relatively 

low, followed by changing the relative position between the electrodes with the arc 
therebetween and the fibers to the conventional "heating" position and forming the 

splice.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of arc fusion splicing
optical fibers.For many optical fiber applications, it is necessary to splice two
separate lengths of fiber together to form a single spliced length of fiber. Frequently,
these splices need to have high strength, comparable to the strength of the fiber.Among known fiber splicing techniques is arc fusion splicing, which can
be an automated process. Exemplarily, a computer controlled fiber positioner aligns
the fiber ends face-to-face until optimum fiber-to-fiber optical transmission is
achieved. A current is then supplied to two electrodes, with the resulting electric arc
heating the optical fibers such that the two abutting fiber ends are fused together.
See, for instance, D. L. Bisbee, "Splicing Silica Fibers With an Electric Arc",
Applied Optics, Vol.15, No. 3, March 1976, pp. 796-798.It is known that optical fiber splices that are formed by means of arc
fusion frequently have relatively low strength, frequently less than half of the
intrinsic strength of the glass. This is a drawback that limits the usefulness of this,
otherwise advantageous, splicing technique. Thus, it would be desirable to have
available an arc fusion splicing method and apparatus that can produce a higher
percentage of high strength splices than is typically obtained with prior art
techniques and apparatus. This application discloses such a method. According to the present invention. there is provided a method as
defined in claim 1.FIG. 1 shows an exemplary SEM (scanning electron microscope)
micrograph of an electrode tip;FIG. 2 shows a SEM micrograph of a portion of a fiber fracture surface
with associated particle;FIGS. 3 and 4 present exemplary strength data for fibers spliced
according to the invention and according to the prior art; andFIG. 5 schematically depicts exemplary apparatus for carrying out the method
of the invention.This invention is embodied in a method of splicing the
ends of two optical fibers to form a single length of optical fiber, and can yield a
higher percentage of splices of strength above a given minimum strength than is
typically attained with prior art arc fusion methods.We have made the surprising discovery that the, frequently observed,
relatively high percentage of low strength arc fusion splices is typically associated
with particulate emission from the electrodes, especially during the initial period of
arc operation. FIG. 1 is a SEM micrograph of the tip of an electrode and shows a
plethora of particles, typically SiO2 particles,
