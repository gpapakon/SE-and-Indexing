<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a milk protein partial hydrolysate, a process for the
enzymatic preparation of a milk protein partial hydrolysate
and infant formula products of reduced antigenicity
containing said hydrolysate.A large number of infant formulas are based on proteins
from cow's milk. Infants who are truly allergic to milk
protein require infant formulas wherein the proteins are
extensively hydrolyzed to contain a minimum of residual
molecular structures. For non-allergic infants, an infant
formula with reduced antigenicity has prophylactic benefits
in that it can delay or prevent sensitization which could
otherwise lead to clinical symptoms of allergy. The
allergenic potential of cow milk-protein based formulas can
be reduced by protein hydrolysis.To ideally meet the composition of human milk, the cow
milk protein in infant formulas should contain both whey
protein and casein in an appropriate ratio. While a number
of products based on intact milk protein meet a desirable
whey protein to casein ratio, almost all of the commercially
available partially hydrolyzed formulas are based on 100%
whey protein.Processes for preparation of partial hydrolysates
described in the literature generally involve multi-step
hydrolysis and physical separations after the hydrolysis to
eliminate enzymes and/or residual proteins. Most processes
also involve constant pH control during hydrolysis. Also,
unless another process step is introduced, the resulting
hydrolysate will usually have a high level of salts which
can pose formulation problems in the infant formula, the
level of minerals of which are usually regulated at a
certain level.U.S. Patent 5,039,532 describes two steps of enzymatic
hydrolysis to attain a hydrolysate of desired 
characteristics. It also describes preparation of an infant
formula which is ultra-high temperature (UHT) sterilized.Gmoshinsky et al. describe in Vopr. Pitan. 3, 21-27 (1991) milk protein-derived preparations with decreased antigenicity.
U.S. Patents 4,293,571 and 4,981,704 both describe partial
hydrolysates prepared using pancreatic enzymes which involve
post-hydrolysis membrane processes to separate out the
residual proteins and enzymes.A common characteristic of protein hydrolysates,
particularly hydrolysates containing casein, is bitter
flavor development putatively due to liberation of peptides
with hydrophobic end groups. Moreover, the emulsifying
property of proteins generally is also decreased as the
degree of hydrolysis increases. Japanese Patent 1160458
describes a
