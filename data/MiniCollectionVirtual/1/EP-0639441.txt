<ABSTRACT>
When foam-filling housings (4), in particular refrigerator housings, with a reaction mixture whose blowing agent can form during evaporation a mixture which with atmospheric oxygen is explosive, the risk of explosion can be reduced by introducing into the space (7) to be foam-filled an inert gas by means of a servo-controlled inlet valve (8, 9).

<CLAIMS>
A method of foaming casings (4, 24) with CFC-free
polyurethane foams by adding a blowing agent, preferably

pentane, butane, hexane, forming a potentially
explosive mixture with atmospheric oxygen during

evaporation, to at least one of the reaction
components, characterised in that, before introduction

of the reaction mixture into the space (7, 27) to be
foamed, inert gas is introduced into said space

(7, 27) via a servo-controlled inlet valve
(8; 9, 28; 29).
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that,
even after the introduction of the reaction mixture

into the space (7, 27) to be foamed, inert gas is
introduced into said space (7, 27) until the rising

front of foam has reached the point of entry.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the inert gas is introduced at the highest point

of the space to be foamed (7, 27).
A device for foaming casings (4, 24), consisting of a
supporting mould (1, 21) in which the casing is

situated, and a mixing head (3, 23) , characterised by a
servo-controlled inlet valve (8; 9, 28; 29) for inert

gas, opening into the space (7, 27) to be foamed.
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that
the inlet valve (9, 29) is arranged at the highest

point of the space (7, 27) to be foamed. 
A device according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in
that the inlet valve (8, 28) is arranged on the mixing

head (3, 23).
A device according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in
that the inlet valve (9, 29) is arranged on the

supporting mould (1, 21).
A device according to one of claims 4 to 7,
characterised in that at least two inlet valves (8;

28, 9; 29) are provided.
