<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
tape for use in a cassette for a digital audio tape
recorder and a biaxially oriented polyester base film
therefor. More specifically, it relates to a magnetic
tape which can be used as a magnetic tape for use in a
cassette for an audio tape recorder of a digital
recording method using a fixed magnetic head such as a
magnetic tape for use in a digital·compact·cassette
(DCC) and which is remarkably free of extension and
deformation when used and is highly densely recordable;
and a biaxially oriented polyester base film therefor.The use of biaxially stretched polyester films for magnetic recording media is disclosed, for
example, in JP-A-01 163 260.In recent years, audio cassette tape
recorders of a digital recording method excellent in
sound quality have been developed as a digital·audio
tape recorder (DAT) of a rotary magnetic head method
and a digital·compact·cassette tape recorder (DCC) of a
fixed magnetic head method. In DCC of a fixed magnetic
head method in particular, "azimuth (direction)
stabilizing tape guides" are provided above and below
the magnetic head for stable tape running, and an
"azimuth lock pin" is provided on each side of a tape
pad, thereby to secure higher stability, as is
described, e.g., in "DCC·MD Guide Book" written by
MURATA Kinya (issued by Denpa Shinbunsha). In
particular, each tape guide has a gradient guide wall,
and a tape is allowed to run with one edge of the tape
being pushed to the guide wall surface thereby to force
the tape in the direction of the other edge of the
tape. As a consequence, the tape stably runs without
vibration in the tape width direction. Further, the
lock pins constitute a structure with which the tape is
reliably kept in contact with the magnetic head.
Owing to this structure, one edge of the tape which
runs on the gradient wall of the tape guide is forcibly 
elongated by several percent. Due to this, one edge of
the tape may be elongated and the tape may be folded to
deteriorate the contact between the tape and a magnetic
head (head touch). As a result, recording signals may
drop out at a recording time, the output at a play back
time may be insufficient, the tape running is rendered
unstable, and these defects may cause a trouble that
reproduction signals are not accurately readable. Even
if a base film for an analog recording tape, which has
high strength in the longitudinal direction, is used as
a base film for DCC, it is difficult to prevent the
extension or deformation of the tape caused by a
tensi
