<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing water treatment techniques capable of carrying out a high-performance water 
purifying treatment by efficiently removing a synthetic organic compound, such as a surface active agent for a detergent 

and components of agricultural chemicals from contaminated water having a comparatively low load of, for example, 
BOD. To achieve this object, a utilizable filter medium formed by depositing a substrate having a specific utilizability 

by the target microorganisms on a porous base material, such as charcoal, is used as the filter medium, with which 
contaminated water to be treated is brought into contact under aerobic conditions. Using the utilizable filter medium 

in this manner enables specified microorganisms having a high efficiency of removing synthetic organic contaminants 
to be selectively utilized, and synthetic organic compounds to be efficiently removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water treatment technology, and more
particularly, to a water treatment technology suitable for performing
advanced purification treatment on waste water having a relatively low
pollution load.It is widely known that LAS (Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonates; surface
activators used as the major ingredient of synthetic cleaners) can be
effectively removed from water by activated sludge processes enabling
efficient water treatment of waste water having a relatively high
pollution load in the manner of sewer water and industrial waste water
(for example, "Water Pollution Research", Vol. 5, No. 1, pp. 19-25 as well
as "Research on Biodegradation of Sodium Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonates
(LAS) by Activated Sludge - Parts (I) and (II) of pp. 63-72 of Vol. 5, No.
2 of this same publication, 1982).However, in the case of treatment of river basin waterways, and
particularly rivers into which flow domestic waste water and water
contaminated with agricultural chemicals, considered to account for a
significant proportion of the route by which synthetic organic compounds
such as LAS and agricultural chemicals enter the environment, it is
difficult to apply activated sludge processes due to the pollution load
being excessively low and the presence of large daily fluctuations in that 
load.In addition, although numerous examples of water treatment technology aimed
at treatment of water in such rivers and waterways are already known, these
known technologies are unable to demonstrate significant effects with
respect to removal of LAS. In addition, due to decreased performance
caused by clogging of the filter material used, saturation and so forth,
all of these technologies have problems that remain to be solved for
stable continuation of advanced purification treatment.Moreover, although there are also numerous reports regarding removal by
adsorption of LAS using charcoal and activated carbon, charcoal does not
have adsorptivity to effectively carry out removal of LAS, while activated
carbon, although having a high level of adsorptivity, suffers problems in
terms of saturation and running costs.To describe in detail, with respect to rivers and waterways which are major
discharge routes into the environment for harmful synthetic organic
pollutants such as LAS, and for which there is a strong desire to remove
these pollutants, there is still no process by which these synthetic
organic pollutants can be effectively removed at the practical level.However, the inventors of the present invention
