<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a new hydrated zinc borate
compound having a high dehydration temperature which offers
significant advantages for compounding with plastics and
rubbers at elevated temperatures. The anhydrous form of the
zinc borate compound is also provided, offering advantages
for compounding at even higher temperatures.Many different hydrated zinc borates are known and
several find commercial application as fire retardants and
smoke suppressants for various polymers. Hydrated zinc
borates are also used as anti-corrosive pigments for coatings
and have demonstrated fungistatic and bacteriostatic
properties which find many applications. The known hydrated zinc borates include
ZnO·B2O3·H2O, 2ZnO·3B2O3·3.5H2O, 2ZnO·3B2O3·7H2O,
3ZnO·5B2O3·14H2O (sometimes designated
2ZnO·3B2O3·9H2O), ZnO·B2O3·2H2O, ZnO·5B2O3·4.5H2O,
2ZnO·3B2O3·3H2O, and 6ZnO·5B2O3·3H2O. See Supplement
to Mellor's Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and
Theoretical Chemistry, Vol. V, Part A, Pages 577-578,
Longman Group Ltd (1980). See also pages 572-6 for a
review of anhydrous zinc borates. Several of these
zinc borate hydrates have commercial importance,
especially as fire retardants and smoke suppressants
for polymers, rubbers and coatings. The relatively
high dehydration temperature (about 290°C) of
2ZnO·3B2O3·3.5H2O offers a significant advantage over
other commercially available hydrated zinc borates
since elevated temperatures are required for
compounding many plastics and rubbers. However, some
of the recently developed engineering plastics require
processing at even higher temperatures in the range of
about 300-400°C, and it is desirable to have a zinc
borate which has an even higher dehydration
temperature. The present invention provides zinc borate
compounds having a ZnO:B2O3 ratio of 4:1.According to the invention, there is provided a
zinc borate compound
of formula 4ZbO·B2O3·H2O or a
compound of formula 4ZnO·B2O3 which is essentially anhydrous.The present invention also provides a crystalline
hydrated zinc borate compound which has the formula
4ZnO·B2O3·H2O and the characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern
given in Example 1.The present invention further provides a
fire-retardant, smoke suppressant, or coating composition
comprising an organic polymer and a zinc borate compound as
defined above.The present invention additionally provides the use
of a zinc borate compound as defined above as a
fire-retardant or smoke suppressant for an organic polymer
composition.The crystalline, hydrated zinc borate compound has a
