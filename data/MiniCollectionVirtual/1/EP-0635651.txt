<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a bearing arrangement (10) for a rotating shaft (24) belonging to a windscreen wiper drive mechanism (28) of the type including a casing (12) in which there is formed a bore (16) through which the shaft (24) passes with interposition of at least one bearing bush (32) and which includes at least one internal radial collar (18), a first face of which constitutes a first shoulder for the axial positioning of a seal (34) located inside the bore (16) which interacts with the facing cylindrical surfaces of the bore (16) and of the shaft (24), characterised in that one (37) of the ends of the bearing bush (32) butts up against a second shoulder (38) consisting of the second face of the radial collar (18), and in that the inside diameter of the internal radial collar (18) is greater than the internal diameter of the bearing bush (32).

A bearing (10) for a rotatable shaft (24) of a
drive mechanism for a screen wiper (28), of the type

comprising a casing (12) in which is formed a bore (16)
through which the shaft (24) extends, with at least one

bearing sleeve (32) being interposed, and which
includes at least one internal radial collar element

(18), the internal diameter of which is greater than
the internal diameter of the bearing sleeve (32), the

said radial collar element (18) having:

a first face constituting a first shoulder (36) for
the axial positioning of a sealing member (34) which is

disposed in the bore (16) and which cooperates with the
surfaces, in facing relationship with each other, of

the bore (16) and the shaft (24), the said sealing
member being in engagement against the first shoulder

(36), and
a second face constituting a second shoulder (38) on
which an end (37) of the bearing sleeve (32) is in

abutment, with an end portion (25) of the said shaft
(24) projecting axially outwardly beyond a radial end

face (20) of the bearing casing (12), characterised in
that the sealing member (34) can be fitted by axial

introduction into a cylindrical annular housing which 
is bounded by the cylindrical surfaces, in facing

relationship with each other, of the bore (16) and the
shaft (24), and which is open in the radial end face

(20) of the casing (12), and in that a retaining bush
(50) is disposed at the end (20) of the bearing casing

(12), the said retaining bush (50) having a tubular
portion (52) which extends axially within the annular

housing, and the end face (54) of which constitutes an
abutment for the sealing member (34).
A bearing according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the retaining bush (50) includes a hood portion

(56) in the form of a capuchon, through which the shaft
(24) extends, and which bears axially against the

radial end face (20) of the casing (12).
A bearing according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the retaining bush (50) includes

sealing means (64) which are in cooperation with a
portion, in facing relationship therewith, of the

cylindrical surface of the shaft (24).
A bearing according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the sealing means comprise a sealing lip (64)

formed integrally with the retaining bush (50) and
projecting radially from the cylindrical internal

surface of the retaining bush (50) for sealing
cooperation with the cylindrical surface of the shaft

(24). 
A bearing according to Claim 4 taken in combination
with Claim 2, characterised in that the sealing lip

(64) is formed in the vicinity of the free end (62) of
the hood portion (56) of the retaining bush (50).
A bearing according to Claim 2 or Claim 5,
characterised in that the hood portion (56) has an

external profile (78) in the form of a surface of
revolution, for guiding flow of liquid towards the

outside of the casing (12).
A bearing according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the tubular portion (52) of the

bearing bush (50) is nested elastically in the annular
housing.
A bearing according to Claim 7, characterised in
that the tubular portion (52) of the retaining bush

(50) is split axially so as to constitute resiliently
deformable lugs (66).
A bearing according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the sealing member (34) is formed

integrally (34) with the free end of the tubular
portion (52) of the retaining bush (50).
A bearing according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that means (60) are provided

for axially immobilising the retaining bush (50) with
respect to the casing (12).
