<ABSTRACT>
Carrier apparatus for the transport of articles on the roof (2) 
of a motor-vehicle, particularly an all-purpose carrier, 

a ski-carrier or the like, including support structure 
(1a;1b) having feet (4,5) which bear on the side edge 

portions of the roof (2). The structure (1a,1b) has at 
least one associated magnetic plate (10) which can be 

applied to the roof (2) to retain the apparatus thereon 
substantially without transmitting the load of the 

articles carried by the support structure (1a;1b) to the 
roof (2), the transmission of the load being entrusted 

substantially only to the resting feet (4,5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carrier apparatus for the 
transport of articles on the roof of a motor vehicle, 
particularly of an all-purpose carrier, ski-carrier or 
the like type, comprising a support structure having feet 
for resting on the side edge portions of the roof. An apparatus of the above type and comprising the features of the 
first part of claim 1 and 14 is known from DE-A 3 135 649 in 
which the resting feet 
are provided with anchoring means for connecting the 
support structure via a magnetic plate to the 
side edges of the motor-vehicle roof during use. Other transport devices are also known which have magnetic 
anchorages for enabling articles to be carried on a 
motor-vehicle roof and which can easily be mounted on 
the roof but these have the disadvantage of a limited 
load-bearing capacity because of the deformations which 
the loads themselves produce in the support zone which is 
substantially central of the roof. The object of the present invention is to provide and further 
develop the transport apparatus of the type defined at the beginning 
of the present description which is particularly 
convenient and easy to install on the roof of a motor  
 
vehicle by the user. According to the invention, this object is achieved by 
the features as defined in claims 1 and 14. By virtue of this characteristic, the apparatus of the 
invention does not require the resting feet to have associated 
anchoring means and can be installed particularly simply and 
quickly by the user and also does not involve a risk of 
causing deformation to the motor-vehicle roof during use 
even when the loads transported are relatively large. 
This transport apparatus may also be removed from the 
motor-vehicle roof when it is not required for use and 
can be placed, for example, in the boot so as to occupy 
little space. The invention will now be described in detail with 
reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by 
way of non-limitative example, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of apparatus 
according to the present invention associated with the  
 
roof of a motor vehicle, Figure 2 illustrates a variant of Figure 1 in which 
particular details of the device are shown, Figure 3 is a partially-sectioned, enlarged side 
elevational view indicated by the arrow III 
of Figure 2, Figure 4 is a perspective view of a variant of 
Figure 2, Figure 5 is a front elevational view, partly 
sectioned along the line V-V of Figure 4, and  Figures 6,7 and 8 are variants of the device of 
Figure 1.

<CLAIMS>
Carrier apparatus for the transport of articles on the roof 
(2) of a motor vehicle, particularly of an all-purpose 

carrier, ski-carrier or the like type, comprising a 
support structure (1a;1b) having feet (4,5) for resting 

on the side edge portions of the roof (2), and at least 
one associated magnetic plate (10);
 
characterised in that 

the at least one associated magnetic plate (10) is arranged 
separately from the resting feet at the support structure 

(1a;1b) which magnetic plate is applied to the roof (2) to retain 
the carrier apparatus 

(1) thereon substantially without transmitting the load 
of the articles carried by the support structure (1a;1b) 

to the roof (2), the load transmission being entrusted 
substantially only to the resting feet (4,5). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the resting feet (4) have respective bases (5) articulated 

about axes substantially perpendicular to the support 
structure (1a;1b). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the or each magnetic plate (10) has at least one 

associated retaining member (8) for attaching it to the 
support structure (1a;1b). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the support structure is a bar (1a) comprising a 

cross-member (3).  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the support structure is a body (1b) shaped 

substantially as a half-shell. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that it includes adjustment means (4a,5a) for adjusting 

the height of the resting feet (4) relative to the body (1b). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the body (1b) includes means (1c) for retaining 

articles to be transported. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 and 4 or 5, characterised 
in that the or each retaining member (8) is connected 

resiliently to the magnetic plate (10). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the or each retaining member (8) is connected 

permanently to the cross-member (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the or each retaining member (8) is connected releasably 

to the cross-member (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 and 4, characterised in 
that each retaining member (8) is connected to the 

magnetic plate (10) at at least two points on opposite 
sides of the cross-member (3).  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the or each magnetic plate (10) has an associated 

pair of retaining members (8) intended to be located 
side-by-side along the cross-member (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that each cross-member (3) has an associated pair of 

magnetic plates (10). 
A unit for the transport of articles on the roof (2) 
of a moto
r-vehicle, particularly an all-purpose carrier, 
ski-carrier or the like, including at least two support 

structures (1a;1b) each of which 
includes at least one magnetic 

plate (10) and resting feet (4,5) for bearing on the side edge 
portions of the roof (2), characterised in that each of the support 

structures (1a;1b) is retained on the roof (2) by means 
of said magnetic plate (10) which is arranged separately from 

the resting feet (4,5) at the support structures (1a;1b) 
while the load of the 

articles transported by the support structures (1a;1b) is 
transmitted to the roof (2) substantially only through the 

resting feet (4,5).
