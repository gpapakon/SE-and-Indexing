<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is capable of framing automatically 
photographic films by means of a first operation according 

to which the film (6) is divided into several photograms (9) and a 
second operation according to which the photograms (9) are 

introduced into the interior of frames (1) which are 
mechanically opened on one side, thus obtaining as the final 

product the "diapositiva", that is slide or filmslide (12). 
The cutting of the film (6) is carried out when the film is partially 
inserted between the two valves (10,11) of the frame (1). The told 

insertion of the photogram (9) is subsequently carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is to provide 
an apparatus to frame automatically photographic films by 
means of a first cutting operation of the same film in 
individual photograms and a second operation which involves 
the introduction of the same photograms in the interior of 
small frames which are mechanically opened on one side thus 
obtaining as the final article the so called "diapositiva" 
that is slide or filmslide. This diapositiva, slide or filmslide, presents 
itself as a small frame of substantially quadrilateral shape 
and with standardized dimensions, the small frame being made 
of a plastic material and being constituted by two 
half-frames or valves which being reciprocally bonded one to 
the other hold the photograms between them. A very well known type of a small frame provides 
the two half-frames or valves being bonded between 
themselves along three sides while the fourth side remains 
free in order to allow the introduction of the photogram 
according to the framing operation. According to the present state of the art, several 
methods and apparatuses are known for the sub-division of  
 
the photographic film in individual photograms and for the 
subsequent operation of framing the same. The main drawback 
of the methods used up to the present in the framing 
operation consists of the possibility of damaging the 
photogram during the insertion of the same in the small 
frame. This is due to the fact that the introduction of the 
photogram through the opening formed by the two free sides 
of the two valves facing each other and the centering of the 
same with respect to the two valves is made through 
entrainment means such as pincers or sucking means which, 
acting on the surfaces of the same photogram cause in 
general scratching and damages and in addition limit the 
speed of operation and production capacity of the apparatus. A partial solution of the problems discussed 
hereinabove is obtained by means of framing apparatuses in 
which the photographic film moves in the orthogonal 
direction towards the open side of the two valves which are 
reciprocally bonded. Therefore, after the initial part of 
the film is inserted in the interior of the small frame, one 
proceeds with cutting of one piece or the photogram by means 
of a cutting blade which acts in the interior of the profile 
of the same small frame. Thus the apparatus on one hand eliminates the 
means for the manipulation of the film because the film 
positions itself automatically in the interior of the frame

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for framing a photographic film which 
comprises: 


a) a storehouse for the hollow frames (1), 
b) means (3) for advancing said hollow frames (1) from 
said storehouse (2) towards a working zone (K-K), each of 

said frames (1) being composed of two valves (10 and 11), 
said valves having four sides and being bonded to each other 

along three sides thereof, said valves having limbs (4 and 
5), 
c) means (23) for advancing said film (6) to said 
working zone, 
d) a profile (17) located transversely with respect to 
said film (6); said limbs (4 and 5) being adapted to 

diverging when they meet said profile (17), said profile 
(17) being constituted by two semi-shells (18 and 19) one of 

which (19) is superimposed over the other (18) and being 
integral between themselves, said two half-shells being 

capable of diverging said limbs (4 and 5) of one of said 
frames (1) whereby a portion of said film (6) is inserted in 

the interior between said valves (10 and 11) of said frame 
(1), said film having an extremity (25), said frame (1) 

having a side (26), whereby a free space is left between 
said extremity of said film (25) and said side (26), 
e) a cutting blade (22), said half-shell (19) which is 
 

superimposed on said half-shell (18) having an opening (21) 
on the shoulder of a bridge (20), said blade (22) going 

through said opening (21) whereby said film (6) is cut 
externally with respect to said frame (1), whereby a 

plurality of photograms is obtained; 
f) a counterblade which is integral with said 
lower-half shell (18), said counterblade being adapted to 

stop said photogram downstream of said cutting blade, means 
(8) for advancing said frame (1) towards said counterblade 

whereby the total insertion of said photogram (9) within 
said frame (1) is achieved. 
The apparatus according to claim (1) wherein said film 
(6) is inserted in said small frame (1) to an extent of 

about 3/4 of the dimension of said frame which is parallel 
to said film. 
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said 
advancing means (3) is a belt, said storehouse (2) is of the 

rotating type and has a plurality of receptacles (27) and 
said frames (1) are placed as a pile within said receptacles 

(27), said receptacles having sides arranged in a direction 
which is other than parallel with respect to the axis of 

said belt 3), also when they are in a position corresponding 
to the direction of said advance of said belt.
