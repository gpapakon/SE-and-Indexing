<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nonaqueous secondary
battery having improved charge and discharge cycle
characteristics and improved safety.Negative electrode active materials for nonaqueous
secondary batteries typically include metallic lithium and
lithium alloys. The problem associated with these active
materials is that metallic lithium grows dendritically during
charging and discharging to cause an internal short circuit,
involving a danger of ignition because of high activity of
the dendritical metal perse. To solve the problem, a
calcined carbonaceous material capable of intercalating and
deintercalating lithium has recently been put to practical
use. However, since the carbonaceous material has electrical
conductivity by itself, metallic lithium is sometimes
precipitated on the carbonaceous material at the time of an
overcharge or a rapid charge. It eventually follows that
lithium grows dendritically thereon. This problem has been
dealt with by altering a charger or reducing the amount of
the positive electrode active material to prevent an
overcharge. Where the latter solution is adopted, however,
the limited amount of the active material leads to a limited
discharge capacity. Further, the carbonaceous material has a 
relatively low density and therefore a low capacity per unit
volume. Thus, the discharge capacity is limited by both the
amount of the active material and the capacity per unit
volume.In addition to metallic lithium, lithium alloys and
the above-mentioned carbonaceous material, negative electrode
active materials so far proposed include TiS2 and LiTiS2
which are capable of intercalating and deintercalating
lithium (U.S. Patent 3,983,476); transition metal oxides
having a rutile structure, such as WO2 (U.S. Patent
4,198,476), spinel compounds, such as LixFe(Fe2)O4 (JP-A-58-220362,
the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application"); a electrochemically
synthesized lithium compound of Fe2O3 (U.S. Patent
4,464,447); a lithium compound of Fe2O3 (JP-A-3-112070); Nb2O5
(JP-B-62-59412 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an
"examined published Japanese patent application") and JP-A-2-82447);
FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, CoO, Co2O3, and Co3O4 (JP-A-3-291862);
amorphous V2O5 (JP-A-4-223061); and transition metal
oxides having their basic crystal structure changed by
intercalation of a lithium ion (EP 567149). Any of these
known compounds has a high oxidation-reduction potential,
failing to provide a nonaqueous secondary battery having a
discharge potential as high
