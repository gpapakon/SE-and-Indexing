<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of setting the use-side bristle ends of at least one bundle of bristles during the production of bristle-bearing articles, in particular toothbrushes, in which the bundle of bristles, which has been inserted into a channel of a carrier and cut to a predetermined size, is brought to bear with its use-side bristle ends on the surface of a setting plate, the surface of which corresponds to the setting of the use-side bristle ends of the bundle of bristles. In order to make it possible for a bundle of bristles or the use-side bristle ends of the bundle of bristles to be able to be set without the need for a carrying plate with pistons for displacing the bundle of bristles or the bristles into the channel of the carrier, the bundle of bristles is brought to bear with its use-side bristle ends on the surface of the setting plate by a compressed gas and/or by a vacuum.
