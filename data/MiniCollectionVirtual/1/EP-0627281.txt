<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a rotary finishing pad for 
finishing of a smoothed surface with substantially 

reduced hydraulic suction, comprising:
 

   a backing substrate;
 

   means for attaching the backing substrate to a 
rotary tool; and

 
   at least one abrasive component attached to the 

backing substrate wherein the total abrasive surface 
area encompassed by the at least one abrasive component 

is from 1% to 30% of the surface area of the pad, 
whereby hydraulic suction is minimized thereby allowing 

greater forces to be placed on the abrasive pad to 
increase abrasive cutting efficiency of a particular 

sized abrasive grit. This equipment can minimize 
hydraulic suction effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to abrasive pads for 
finishing of marble, granite, stone or other irregular 
surfaces which have stepped portions, edges, lips of 
the like which must be traversed during the abrading or 
finishing operation. Rotary abrasive tools are commonly in use in many 
sanding and grinding operations. Generally, abrading 
assemblies used in these rotary tools include a backing 
substrate, such as a foam pad or a rubber backing mat 
or the like, and an abrading pad which can be 
temporarily attached and replaced as the pad wears out 
during the finishing operation. The use of such a tool 
has many advantages including quickness of cutting and 
easy replaceability of the abrasive pads. However, it 
has always been a problem in the use of rotary tools 
that during grinding of irregular large flat areas, 
i.e. greater than the surface area of the pad, the pads 
tend to deteriorate quickly and/or leave an irregular 
surface due to gouging and the like because of 
contacting the irregularities in the surface. While many grinding situations have irregular 
surfaces which tend to tear or break up the pad or 
cause surface deformities therein, a particularly 
problematic area today has been the finishing or 
refinishing of floors which are constructed with tiles 
or stones laid in a mortar base. Such floors have many 
edges to traverse during finishing thereof. This is 
partially because of the spaced stone edges and 
partially because the stones are seldom co-planar one 
to another over the floor surface. Floor finishing units are commonly utilized in 
finishing or reconditioning such floors. Such units 
include three rotating planetary heads and have a base 
which also rotates to provide an even finish to flat 
surfaces such as floors. In these units, various  
 
coarseness abrasive pads are used on each of the heads 
for sanding and final finishing of the floor. In the 
past, this has been problematic in that relatively 
stiff pads were commonly used. Often while such a 
stiff pad is traversing the lip, step or edge from one 
floor stone to another the lack of flexibility in the 
pad can cause gouging of the adjacent stone when the 
pad is canted at the transition area. This reduced the 
quality of the finish. On the other hand, when 
relatively flexible pads are used on such rotary tools 
the useful life of the pad is substantially reduced. 
This is so because when encountering unfinished edges 
or steps from stone to stone, the edge of the pad 
catches on the edges and will tend to be shredded
