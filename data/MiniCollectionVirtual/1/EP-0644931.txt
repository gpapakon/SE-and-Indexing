<DESCRIPTION>
RECOMBINANT HERPESVIRUS OP TURKEYS AND USES THEREOFBackground Of The InventionThe ability to isolate DNA and clone such isolated DNA into bacterial plasmids has greatly expanded the approaches available to make viral vaccines. The methods used to make the present invention involve modifying cloned DNA sequences from various pathogens of animals, by insertions, deletions, single or multiple base changes, and subsequent insertions of these modified sequences into the genome of the virus. One utility of the addition of foreign sequences is achieved when the foreign sequence encodes a foreign protein that is expressed during viral infection of the animal. The resulting live virus may then be used in a vaccine to elicit an immune response in a host animal and provide protection to the animal against disease. A virus with these characteristics is referred to as a viral vector, because it becomes a living vector that will carry and express the foreign protein in the host animal. In effect it becomes an elaborate delivery system for the foreign protein(s) .More specifically, the present invention relates to the use of herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) as a viral vector for vaccination of birds against disease. The group of herpesviruses comprise various pathogenic agents that infect and cause disease in a number of target species: swine, cattle, chickens, horses, dogs, cats, etc. Each herpesvirus is specific for its host species, but they are all related in the structure of their genomes, their mode of 

replication, and to some extent in the pathology they cause in the host animal and in the mechanism of the host immune response to the virus infection.The application of recombinant DNA techniques to animal viruses has a relatively recent history. The first viruses to be engineered have been those with the smallest genomes. In the case of the papovaviruses, because these viruses are so small and cannot accommodate much extra DNA, their use in genetic engineering has been as defective replicons. Foreign gene expression from these viruses requires a wild- type helper virus and is limited to cell culture systems. For adenoviruses, there is a small amount of nonessential DNA that can be replaced by foreign sequences. The only foreign DNA that seems to have been expressed in adenoviruses are the T-antigen genes from papovaviruses (Mansour, et al . , Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . US, 1985; Thummel, et al . , Cell , 1983; Scolnick, et al . , Cell , 1981; Thummel, et al . , Cell , 1981), and the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thy
