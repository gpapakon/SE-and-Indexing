<ABSTRACT>
A universal joint (40) between an upper 
steering shaft (36) and a lower steering shaft (34) in 

a tilt-adjustable motor vehicle steering column 
includes a pair of bifurcated yokes (44,42) formed to 

near-net-shape integrally with the upper and lower 
shafts, a plastic jacket (60,58) moulded in-situ on 

each of the bifurcated yokes, and a plastic centring 
sphere (66). Each of the plastic jackets has a pair 

of exposed, frusto-conical bearing surfaces 
(64A,B;62A,B) moulded thereon which slidably engage 

corresponding frusto-conical side walls (76A,B;78A,B) 
of cross grooves (72,74) in the plastic centring 

sphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tilt-adjustable 
steering columns for motor vehicles, and in particular 
to a universal joint for the steering shaft assembly 
of the steering column. In a widely available tilt-adjustable motor 
vehicle steering column, a bearing support or tilt 
housing is mounted on a stationary tubular mast jacket 
for up and down pivotal movement about a horizontal 
axis. A steering shaft assembly of the steering 
column includes an upper shaft rotatably supported on 
the tilt housing, a lower shaft rotatably supported on 
the mast jacket, and a universal joint therebetween. 
The universal joint includes bifurcated yokes on the 
upper and lower shafts and a plastic centring sphere 
between the yokes. Each of the yokes has 
frusto-conical bearing surfaces machined on opposite 
sides thereof which bearing surfaces seat in 
correspondingly shaped cross grooves in the centring 
sphere. The bearing surfaces slide relative to the 
sides of the cross grooves when the steering shaft 
assembly is rotated with the tilt housing articulated 
relative to the mast jacket. A universal joint according to this 
invention is an improvement relative to the aforesaid 
universal joints having machined bearing surfaces. A universal joint in accordance with the 
present invention is characterised by the features 
specified in the characterising portion of Claim 1. This invention is a new and improved 
universal joint for a steering shaft assembly of a 
tilt adjustable motor vehicle steering column of the 
type including a lower steering shaft rotatably 
supported on a mast jacket of the steering column and 
an upper steering shaft rotatably supported on a tilt  
 
housing of the steering column. The universal joint 
according to this invention includes a cross grooved 
plastic centring sphere and a bifurcated yoke on each 
of the upper and lower steering shafts. Each yoke has 
a pair of frusto-conical wall portions on opposite 
sides thereof characterised as near-net-shape, that 
is, formed integrally with the shafts by a method, 
such as forging, which is not capable of consistently 
achieving dimensional tolerances within ranges 
comparable to ranges achieved by machining in the 
prior steering shaft universal joints. The universal 
joint according to this invention further includes an 
in-situ moulded plastic jacket over each of the 
frusto-conical wall portions of the bifurcated yokes 
which jackets define a pair of frusto-conical bearing 
surfaces on opposite sides of the corresponding yoke.

span; characterised by a first plastic jacket (58) 
moulded in-situ on the first bifurcated yoke and 

defining on opposite sides thereof a first pair of 
exposed frusto-conical bearing surfaces (62A,B) on the 

pair of arc-shaped arms on the first bifurcated yoke; 
by a second plastic jacket (60) moulded in-situ on the 

second bifurcated yoke and defining on opposite sides 
thereof a second pair of exposed frusto-conical 

bearing surfaces (64A,B) on the pair of arc-shaped

respective ones of the second pair of frusto-conical 
bearing surfaces. 
A universal joint as claimed in Claim 1, 
further including a first pair of near-net-shape 

frusto-conical walls (54A,B) on opposite sides of the 
first bifurcated yoke (42) on each of the pair of 

arc-shaped arms (46A,B) on the first bifurcated yoke 
disposed under respective ones of the first pair of 

exposed frusto-conical bearing surfaces (62A,B); and a

a first generally hemispherical segment (68A) of 
plastic material; a second generally hemispherical 

segment (68B) of plastic material; and a spring (70) 
urging relative linear separation between the first 

and the second hemispherical segments thereby to bias 
the frusto-conical side walls (78A,B;76A,B) of the 

first and the second cross grooves (74,72) into

arc-shaped arms (46A,B;50A,B) on the first and the 

second bifurcated yokes (42,44) when the planes of the
