<ABSTRACT>
An adapter for enabling signals produced by a signal source to be 
reproduced as audio sounds by a cassette player audio system comprising a cassette 

audio playback deck of the front-loading type or the side -loading type, comprises a 
housing (10) of a configuration of a cassette normally used with said playback deck, a 

record head (12) supported in a peripheral front wall (14) of said housing, electrical 
conducting means (16) located partly within said housing and extending from said 

housing, the conducting means (16) having one end electrically coupled to said record 
head (12). The housing comprises a first opening (20) in a peripheral side wall (22) of 

said housing, for enabling the conducting means to extend from said adapter from the 
sidewall thereof, such that the adapter may be used with a playback deck of the side 

loading type. The housing further comprises a preformed second opening (36) which is 
closed by closure means (38). The electrical conducting means (16) are fixedly positioned 

in said first opening (20) after final assembly of said adapter for consumer use. The 
housing (10) comprises two housing parts (2,4) being assembled by means of releasable 

assembling means (6), so as to enable a de-assembling of both housing parts. The 
electrical conducting means are releasably positioned in said first opening in one of said 

housing parts (4) after de-assembly of said housing part so as to enable a repositioning 
of the conducting means (16) from the first opening (20) into the preformed second 

opening (36) after removing the closure means (38). After subsequent assembly of said 
adapter so as to enable the use of said adapter with a playback deck of the front-loading 

type, the electrical conducting means (16) are fixedly positioned in said second opening 
(38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an adapter for enabling signals produced by a
signal source to be reproduced as audio sounds by a cassette player audio system
comprising a cassette audio playback deck of the front-loading type or the side -loading
type, wherein a cassette is normally positioned in use substantially completely within the
confines of said cassette playback deck, said adapter comprising:
a housing of a configuration of a cassette normally used with said playback deck,a record head supported in a peripheral front wall of said housing in a position for
contacting a playback head of said playback deck, electrical conducting means located partly within said housing and extending from said
housing, the conducting means having one end electrically coupled to said record head
for providing audio signals to said record head,connector means coupled to an other end of the said electrical conducting means, for
receiving the audio signals for providing to the record head,a first opening in a peripheral side wall of said housing, for enabling the conducting
means to extend from said adapter from the sidewall thereof, such that the adapter may
be used with a playback deck of the side loading type,means being provided in a peripheral rear wall of said housing opposite said record
head for enabling the conducting means to extend from said adapter from the rear wall
thereof, such that the adapter may be used with a playback deck of the front-loading
type, said means comprising a preformed second opening, the housing comprising two
housing parts being assembled by means of releasable assembling means so as to enable
a de-assembling of both housing parts. Such an adapter is known from JP-U 54023701. The adapter described is in the form of a compact cassette. The first
opening in the peripheral side wall and the means provided in the peripheral rear wall 
of the housing of the adapter are combined into one opening provided in the back
corner of the cassette housing. The connecting means loosely extend through said corner
opening so that insertion of the adapter in a playback device of the front-loading type or
the side-loading type is possible, without an obstruction by the connecting means.The known adapter has the disadvantage that the connecting means that
loosely extend through the corner opening might break during continuous use of the
adapter. Further, the corner opening enables dust to enter the adapter.The invention has for its object to offer an improved adapter. To this end,
the adapter in accordance with
