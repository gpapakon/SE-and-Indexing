<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a photovoltaic system comprising a
casing having mounted therein a plurality of solar cells. The casing

has a front and opposite thereto, a rear. The front of the casing is
provided with a light-transmitting panel for transmitting solar light

to the solar cells. The rear is a double wall. A first wall is in
contact with the back of the solar cells, and on its side away from

the solar cells is of a dark-opaque colour, solar-light absorbing surface.
The second wall is a light-transmitting enclosure of the dark-opaque

colour side of the first wall, but spaced therefrom so as to produce a
greenhouse effect. A method to remove snow, frost and ice over a

photovoltaic system involves maintaining the light-transmitting panel
at an angle with the horizontal, receiving reflected solar rays from

the surroundings of the photovoltaic systems through the light-transmitting
enclosure to the outer side being dark-opaque colour to

be absorbed by the outer side and converted into heat to be transmitted
to, and thereby to raise the temperature of the light-transmitting

panel.Simultaneously the light-transmitting enclosure creates
a greenhouse effect and thereby an additional temperature increment

to further raises the temperature of the light-transmitting panel to
melt or sublimate snow, frost and ice present thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photovoltaic system using reflected 
solar rays of the surroundings to dispose of snow, frost ice and the 
like. This invention relates in particular to photovoltaic systems 
having means to efficiently use the reflected solar rays from the 
surroundings of the photovoltaic systems, whether direct or diffused, 
for snow, frost and ice disposal and methods therefor. At present the most sold and profitable photovoltaic systems for 
continental climates such as Canada, must be operative year around in 
sites far remote from civilization, roads and electrical sources. For 
this reason reliability in electricity supply derived from said 
photovoltaic systems is a must coupled with minimum maintenance 
requirement and absence of combustible requirement. The main cause for power failure of these photovoltaic systems, 
is due to snow, frost and ice covering up the cells. Indeed, even a 
partial obstruction suffices to create high energy losses. For instance 
2 cm of snow over photovoltaic systems, decreases the energy 
output by 90%. A few millimetres suffice to reduce the output by half.  
 
Snow covering of the cells also has a cumulative effect, insofar as 
the non-removed snow induces accumulation of future snows and to that 
extent reduces the sun rays able to reach the photovoltaic cells and 
which might be used for instance to heat-up these photovoltaic systems. At present, in order to avoid snow accumulation, the photovoltaic 
systems are placed at an angle which is high with respect to the 
horizontal, they are even vertically placed. This however diminishes 
the energy output without eliminating the snow being blown or the 
glazed frost and the hoar-frost laid by frosted fog, mist and haze. In 
winter, from October to April, the energy loss due to a vertical 
positioning of the photovoltaic systems, instead of an inclination of 
45° or 60°, is greater than 15%, mainly due to the fact that the 
system collects less diffused radiation of the cloudy mass. In summer, 
30% to 40% of the solar radiation is not collected. A search has revealed the following patents all aiming at overcoming 
this problem of snow and ice:
 
   Masakatsu et al teach in JP 53-72487 dated 78.06.27, a solar cell 
unit that reduces the effect of the snow and ice, by providing a 
transparent panel having small friction resistance and thermal transfer 
rate in front of the solar cell module constituted with solar 
cells contained in the transparent material and a removably mounted 
black panel having a
