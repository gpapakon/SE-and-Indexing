<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
elements containing a bicyclic azole coupler and an 
azopyrazolone masking coupler used to correct for 
unwanted absorption in color negative film. More 
particularly, it relates to such elements containing an 
electron-rich aromatic compound having substituents the 
sum of the individual Hammett sigma-para values of 
which is at least as negative as -0.80. The use of 4-phenylazopyrazolone masking 
couplers is known in the art. See, for example, U.S. 
2,428,034; U.S. 2,434,272; U.S. 2,455,170; U.S. 
2,688,539; U.S. 2,704,711; U.S. 2,808,329; U.S. 
3,476,560; U.S. 3,796,574; U.S. 4,427,763; U.S. 
4,777,123, and EP 213,490; as well as those identified 
in Research Disclosure December 1989, Section VII, Part 
G, Publiched by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., 
Dudley Annex, 12A North Street, Emworth, Hampshire PO10 
7DQ, England. These compounds have proven useful since 
they are yellow colored in nonexposed areas and magenta 
colored in exposed areas. Thus, when in reality the 
magenta dye formed in a color negative photographic 
process has a small but significant unwanted absorption 
in the blue range, this may be balanced somewhat by the 
relative loss of blue absorption due to conversion of 
the mask color from yellow to magenta in the exposed 
areas. Then, an adjustment can be made to the spectral 
content of the light used to produce the positive from 
the negative to effectively cancel out the unwanted 
blue absorption, which is now relatively constant 
across both the exposed and unexposed areas of the 
negative.  
 While phenylazopyrazolone masking couplers 
have been employed as a means of offsetting the 
unwanted blue absorption of conventional magenta 
couplers, this means for improving the color rendition 
has now been found to be responsible for the 
degradation during raw stock keeping of bicyclic azole 
image couplers with corresponding losses in contrast, 
optical density and related photographic 
characteristics. The presence of these masking 
couplers results in the degradation and loss of image 
coupler. This is thought to be due to an undesired 
reaction in the raw stock prior to development between 
the masking coupler and undesired oxidants. The 
unwanted degradation of the image coupler eventually 
results in the loss of density in the photographic 
image. It is undesirable to have a film where the 
image density will vary with the length of raw stock 
storage time. European Patent Application 232,101 discloses
