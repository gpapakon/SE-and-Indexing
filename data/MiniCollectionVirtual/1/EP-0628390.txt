<ABSTRACT>
The pump (2) has a proportioning volume (8) serving for proportioning an initial component (3). A proportioned amount of the initial component (3) in the proportioning volume (8) is passed by a conveying stroke of a plunger (5), limiting the proportioning volume (8), into a mixer (1) generating reactive casting compound from the proportioned amount of the initial component (3) and from a proportioned amount of a further initial component (3'). In order to permit accurate proportioning of the initial component (3) over long operating periods, this pump (2) is designed as follows:   - a drive (7), executing the conveying stroke of the plunger (5), has a rotating part monitored by an incremental encoder (21), - the plunger (5) adjoins with a surface facing away from the proportioning volume (8) a pressure-equalising volume (14), which is completely filled with confining fluid and interacts with a pressure-controlling device (17), controlling the pressure of the confining fluid, and - there is provided a pressure-difference monitoring device, which senses the pressure of the initial component (3) in the proportioning volume (8) and the pressure of the confining fluid in the pressure-equalising volume (14) and compares the sensed pressures with each other, and which, after the comparison, forms a signal activating the pressure-controlling device (17) if the amount of the difference between the pressures in the confining fluid and initial component (3) exceeds a predetermined limit value.

Pump (2) for metering a starting component (3) 
and for delivery of a metered amount of the starting 

component into a mixer (1), in which the starting component 
(3) is mixed with a metered amount of a further 

starting component (3') and with optionally provided 
metered amounts of additional starting components to form 

a reactive casting resin compound, having 

a metering volume (8), delimited by a cylinder (4) 
and a movable piston (5), for the starting component, 
a pressure compensation volume (14) which is 
delimited by the cylinder (4) and a surface, remote from 

the metering volume, of the piston (5) and is completely 
filled with sealing liquid, 
a drive (7) which acts on the movable piston (5) for 
altering the metering volume (8) during a conveying 

stroke feeding the starting component into the mixer (1), 
at least one sensor monitoring the conveying stroke 
of the piston (5), and having 
a supervisory unit (20) which processes output 
signals from the at least one sensor and controls the 

drive (7), 
 
characterized by the following features: 


the drive has a part which rotates during the 
execution of the delivery stroke and is monitored by an 

incremental pickup (21) as a sensor for the delivery 
stroke, 
the pressure compensation volume (14) interacts with 
a pressure control unit (17) which controls the pressure 

of the sealing liquid, and 
a pressure-difference monitoring unit is provided, 
which detects the pressure of the starting component (3) 

situated in the metering volume (8) and the pressure of 
the sealing liquid situated in the pressure compensation 

volume (14) and compares the detected pressures with one 
another, and which, following the comparison, forms a 

signal which actuates the pressure control unit (17) if 
the amount of the difference in the pressures in the  

 
sealing liquid and starting component (3) exceeds a 

predetermined limit value. 
Pump according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the limit value is established such that, if the amounts 

of the pressure difference lie below this value, the 
passage of starting component (3) into the pressure 

compensation volume (14) and of sealing liquid into the 
metering volume (8) is avoided. 
Pump according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the speed of the delivery stroke 

can be controlled in accordance with a predetermined 
desired function. 
Pump according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the drive (7) which executes the delivery 

stroke has a linear motor or a geared motor (12) and a 
rotationally fixed spindle (11) which acts on the piston 

(5) with a translational movement. 
Pump according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
that part of the drive (7) which is monitored by the 

incremental pickup (21) is the geared motor (12) or a 
drive element (13) which is rotated by the motor and acts 

on the spindle (11). 
Pump according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized

the end positions of the piston (5) before and 
after a delivery stroke is provided. 
Pump according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
