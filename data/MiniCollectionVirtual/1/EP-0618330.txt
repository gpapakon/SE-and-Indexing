<ABSTRACT>
This mixer (1) comprises a main tank (4-5) fitted with means for introducing a granular product and an additive product, and agitation means (15, 22). It includes an additional tank (11) fitted with means for introducing a second granular product and a second additive product, and second agitation means, as well as means for transferring the contents of the additional tank (11) into an intermediate region (44) of the main tank, as considered along the length of the latter. Application to the preparation of mixtures of granular products with adjuvants and hydrocarbon or hydraulic binders which may or may not be combined, it being possible for the mixtures to be produced cold or hot.

A mixer of the type comprising a first vessel (12) provided with means for introducing a first
granular product and a first additive, and stirrer means (15, 22), a second vessel (11) provided

with means for introducing a second granular product and a second additive, and stirrer means,
and a third vessel (13) for final mixing of the mixed contents of the first and second vessels,

characterized in that the first vessel (12) and the third vessel (13) are two successive parts of a
main vessel, in that the second vessel is an additional vessel (11), and in that the mixer further

comprised means for transferring the contents of the second vessel (11) into an intermediate
region (44) of the main vessel (12-13), as regarded along the length of the latter.
A mixer according to claim 1, characterized in that the additional vessel (11) comprises means
for feeding its contents and opens into the main vessel (12-13) at its front end.
A mixer according to claim 2, characterized in that the main vessel (12-13) comprises means (15,
22) for feeding its contents up to an outlet opening for the final product.
A mixer according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the feeding means of each vessel (11 to
13) are combined with the stirrer means of the vessel.
A mixer according to any of the preceding claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the additional
vessel (11) is mounted above at least part of the width of the main vessel (12-13).
A mixer according to claim 5, characterized in that the additional vessel (11) is mounted in a
position which can be adjusted longitudinaily relative to the main vessel (12-13).
