<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording head
according to the preamble of claim 1 and,
an ink jet head unit and an ink jet
apparatus comprising such an ink jet recording head
which performs the recording by discharging the liquid
(e.g., ink) for recording as tiny liquid droplets
through discharge ports to attach onto the recording
medium, and more particularly to an ink jet head, an
ink jet head unit and an ink jet recording apparatus
for the color printing. The term "recording" for use
with the present invention includes the printing onto
the cloth or plastics.A conventional ink jet recording head is
comprised of a ceiling plate (grooved member) 1120
having a plurality of discharge ports 1105 for discharging
the ink, a recess portion 1118 which is a common
liquid chamber for holding the ink to be supplied to
discharge ports 1105, and ink flow passages 1106 for
communicating the common liquid chamber to discharge
ports 1105, and a silicon substrate 1119 on which
electrothermal converters (not shown) for giving 
discharge energy to the ink within ink flow passages
1106 are formed corresponding to the ink flow passages
1106, the silicon substrate being joined with the
ceiling plate, as shown in Fig. 37 (a perspective view
as looked from the opposite side of the discharge ports)
and Fig. 38 (a perspective view of the ceiling plate
as looked from the side of its junction face with the
substrate). Also, the silicon substrate 1119 has a
drive circuit for driving the electrothermal converters
incorporated therein, this drive circuit being
electrically connected to wire bonding pads 1122 formed
at the end portion of the silicon substrate 1119. And
the silicon substrate 1119 is bonded by thermally
conductive adhesive with an aluminum plate 1121 for
releasing the heat from the silicon substrate 1119.
The aluminum plate 1121 has a Wiring substrate 1125
secured thereto, which relays the signal between the
drive circuit and the ink jet recording apparatus,
the terminals of the Wiring substrate 1125 and the
wire bonding pads 1122 of the silicon substrate 1119
being electrically connected through bonding wires
(external wires) 1123.On the other hand, in making the color printing,
an ink jet unit 1150 having an arrangement of a plurality
of ink jet recording heads 1151 for discharging the
inks of different colors is used, as shown in Fig.
39. However, in this case, the size of the apparatus 
is difficult to reduce because of the employment of
the plurality of ink jet recording heads 1151, and
the cost of
