<ABSTRACT>
The case according to the invention is formed from two identical half-shells with edges (4) which can be snap-fastened over each other. Each half-shell (1) comprises a closing-off peripheral edge (4) equipped with at least two tenons (5, 6) with a rebate (rabbet) (13, 14), which are diametrically opposed and extend the edge (4). Two half-mortices (7, 8) are hollowed out in the diametrically opposed parts of the edge between the successive tenons (5, 6). It is thus possible to produce two identical half-shells.

<CLAIMS>
Box formed of first and second half-shells 
(1, 2) with rims (4) adapted to fit one over the other, 

wherein: 

the two half-shells (1, 2) are identical, 
each half-shell (1) has a closure peripheral rim (4) 
provided with male interengagement means (5, 6) extending 

the rim (4) and female interengagement means (7, 8) 
recessed into the half-shell rim (4) opposite the male 

interengagement means (5, 6), the male interengagement 
means (5, 6) of a first half-shell (1) being shaped and 

disposed to fit with a small clearance in the female 
interengagement means (7, 8) of the second half-shell, 

characterised in that: 
the male interengagement means of one half-shell (1) 
include at least two tenons (5, 6) with rebates (13, 14) 

diametrally opposite each other relative to the centre of 
the half-shell (1), 
the female interengagement means of said half-shell (1) 
include at least two half-mortices (7, 8) diametrally 

opposite each other relative to the centre of the half-shell 
(1) and each accommodated between two successive 

tenons (5, 6) with rebates (13, 14), 
the lateral edges (9, 10) of the tenons (5, 6) with 
rebates (13, 14) of the first half-shell (1) bearing 

against the lateral flanks (11, 12) of the corresponding 
half-mortice of the second half-shell (2). 
Box according to claim 1 characterised in that 
clipping means (22, 23) are moulded into the 

corresponding contact faces of the tenons (5, 6) and the 
half-mortices (7, 8). 
Box according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the clipping means include grooves (22) and ribs (23) 

having a linear longitudinal profile and a trapezoidal 
transverse profile.  

 
Box according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the rebates (13, 14) of the tenons 

(5, 6) face towards the outside of the half-shell 
periphery, the half-mortices (7, 8) being recessed into 

the interior face of the rim (4). 
Box according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the half-mortices (7, 8) have a wall thickness less than 

or equal to half the corresponding half-shell lateral 
wall total thickness, and in that clipping ribs (23) are 

provided on the interior faces of the half-mortices (7, 8) 
and clipping grooves (22) are provided on the exterior 

faces of the tenons (5, 6). 
Box according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that: 


the tenons (5, 6) occupy less than half the perimeter 
of the rim (4), 
the wall of the rim (4) is deformed between a tenon (5) 
and an adjacent half-mortice (8) to constitute an 

exterior housing (15) provided with a half-column (16) 
generally parallel to the wall of the rim (4) and adapted 

to be joined axially to a corresponding half-column of 
the other half-shell to form a post for attaching a 

ring (17). 
Box according to claim 6 characterised in that 
each half-shell (1, 2) has two half-columns (16, 19) 

diametrally opposite each other relative to the centre of 
the half-shell, one half-column (16) having a central 

tenon (20), the other half-column (19) having a central 
mortice in which the tenon (20) can fit. 
Box according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that its periphery is substantially 

circular. 
Box according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that it has a polygonal contour with a 

number of sides that is a multiple of four, with at least  
 

one tenon (5, 6) on alternate sides. 
Box according to any one of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that it further includes interior plate 

retainer spacers (21) adapted to be cut easily and 
projecting from the inside face of the main wall (3).
