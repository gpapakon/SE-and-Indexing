<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to integrated circuit devices 
and more particularly to a base cell device for providing all two input 
functions. In metal programmable gate arrays, it is desirable to be able to 
generate all combinations of N-variables. Base cells are used to create such 
gate arrays. Traditional layouts of base cells have used a combination of two 
P-channel and two N-channel transistors. The gates of the two P-channel 
transistors are typically connected to their respective N-channel counterpart 
transistors. The possible functions of the traditional base cell, obtained by 
connection of metal and contact, are NAND, NOR, NOT, and buffered output 
operations. However, the traditional base cell cannot conveniently perform 
other types of functions such as AND, OR, XOR, or XNOR operations without 
using multiple traditional base cells or requiring multiple logic stages. Further, in order to achieve higher density and lower power, smaller 
transistors are desired to generate the logic while maintaining output drive 
through larger devices. However, traditional base cells require a minimum of 
three metal track connections for the n-channel and p-channel transistors in 
order to provide logic operation and transmission gates. The required 
connections in a traditional base cell limit the ability to reduce the size of 
transistors for logic operations. Therefore, it is desirable to have a base cell 
device that can perform a variety of two input functions with smaller and  
 
fewer transistors at a reduced power consumption than in a traditional base 
cell. From the foregoing it may be appreciated that a need has arisen for a 
base cell device that can perform a wide variety of two input functions. A 
need has also arisen for a base cell device with reduced transistor size and 
reduced power consumption capabilities for performing two input functions. In accordance with the present invention, a base cell device for 
generating two input functions is provided which substantially eliminates or 
reduces disadvantages and problems associated with traditional base cell 
approaches. According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided 
a device for generating two input functions that includes an inverter for 
receiving a control signal and generating an inverted control signal in 
response thereof. A first transmission gate receives a first input, the control 
signal, and the inverted control signal. A second transmission gate receives a 
second input, the control
