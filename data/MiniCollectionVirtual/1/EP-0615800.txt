<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a screw with an ogival point and to a process for obtaining this screw. This process comprises a forging (stamping) step during which the head and the shank of the screw are made, and then a rolling step during which the threads are formed, characterised in that the ogival point (2) of the screw (1) is made before the rolling step, the shape of the envelope of the ogival point corresponding substantially to that obtained after the rolling step.

A process for the production of a screw 
comprising successively a heading phase during which the 

head and the stem of the screw are made, then a phase 

during which an ogival end in continuity with the rest of 
the stem is made and finally, a phase during which the 

threads are formed, characterised in that the threads are 
obtained by rolling so that they are filled regularly 

over the whole length of the ogival end, whereas the 
shape of the shell of the screw thus produced, after 

formation of the threads, corresponds more or less to 
that obtained after formation of the ogival end. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the ogival end is made during the heading phase 

by reducing, at the end of the stem, the diameter of the 
latter by extrusion, then by cold-heading chamfering. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the ogival end is machined. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the means used during the rolling 

phase for the formation of the threads (11) exhibit a 
shell more or less identical to that of the ogival end 

(2) obtained before the rolling phase. 
A process according claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it consists in producing self-cleaning  

 
means (5, 7, 10, 14) on the ogival end of the 

screw. 
A process according to claim 5, characterised 
in that, before the rolling phase, grooves (3, 12, 17 to 

19) are made on the ogival end (2) of the screw. 
A process according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the grooves (3, 12, 17 to 19) exhibit such a 

width that the breadth of the grooves (5) obtained after 
the rolling phase is smaller that than of a thread (11). 
A process according to claim 6 characterised in 
that the shape of the grooves is such that after the 

rolling phase, the thread (6) exhibits a non-constant 
section with provisions for recesses (7, 14). 
A process according to claim 5 characterised in 
that grooves are made on the ogival end of the screw, 

during the rolling phase. 
A process according to any of the claims 5 to 9 
characterised in that the grooves (3) are parallel to the 

axis (4) of the screw. 
A process according to one of the claims 5 to 9 
characterised in that the grooves (17, 18, 19) form a 

non-zero angle with the axis (4) of the screw. 
A process according to one of claims 5 to 11, 
characterised in that it consists in making notches (9, 

20) on the threads (8) during the rolling phase, whereas 
the said notches can accommodate spaces (10, 21). 
A screw with ogival end exhibiting a 
cylindrical section and an ogival end in continuity with 

the cylindrical section, characterised by a thread (11)  
 

whose summit (16) is regularly filled over more or less 
the whole length of the ogival end. 
A screw according to claim 13 characterised in 
that it exhibits self-cleaning means (5, 7, 10, 14) on 

the ogival end (2). 
A screw with ogival end according to claim 14 
characterised in that the self-cleaning means are made of 

grooves (5). 
A screw with ogival end according to claim 15 
characterised in that the number of grooves is equal to 

or greater than 8. 
A screw with ogival end according to claim 14 
characterised in that the self-cleaning means are made by 

the recesses (7, 14) exhibited by the variable section 
thread (6). 
A screw with ogival end according to claim 14 
characterised in that the self-cleaning means are made by 

spaces (10, 21) accommodated by the notches (9, 20) 
exhibited by the thread (8).
