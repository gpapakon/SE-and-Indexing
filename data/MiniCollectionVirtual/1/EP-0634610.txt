gas discharge pipe (3), which pipes are provided at one end with 
connections shut off relative to each other, for connection to the air 

supply and the combustion gas discharge respectively of a burner, and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combined burner air supply 
and combustion gas discharge system, comprising an air supply pipe and 
accommodated therein a combustion gas discharge pipe, which pipes are 
provided at one end with connections shut off relative to each other, for 
connection to the air supply and the combustion gas discharge 
respectively of a burner, and the opposite-lying outside ends of which 
pipes open out into the environment and form an air inlet opening and a 
combustion gas discharge opening, the combustion gas discharge pipe 
running past the air supply pipe. Such a combination is known from Dutch Patent Application 
8700395, which has been laid open for inspection. In this case, a cap is 
placed on top of the end of the combustion gas discharge pipe running 
past the air supply pipe, which means that the air supply pipe opens out 
into the environment along a radially bypassing combustion gas discharge 
opening. The air inlet opening is also formed by the annular gap formed 
between the combustion gas discharge pipe and the end of the air supply 
pipe. The disadvantage of such a combination is that the combustion 
gases discharged in all directions at a higher level can be sucked in 
again through the air supply openings generally disposed very close to 
the underside of the combustion gas discharge opening. At a level 
difference of about twenty centimetres, about 25% recirculation is 
common. In order to prevent this recirculation, it is common to place a 
separating element between the combustion gas discharge opening and the 
air supply opening, but this only slightly limits the amount of 
recirculation. The object of the invention is to provide a combination with 
considerably less recirculation. This is achieved by a combination in 
which the air inlet opening and/or the combustion gas discharge opening 
open out radially on the periphery into the environment only at one 
respective side of the combination, and can be rotated about the 
longitudinal axis of the combination, for purposes of orientation 
relative to the prevailing air flow in the environment under the 
influence of wind orientation means. Through the forced orientation of the blow-out direction and/or 
the suction direction, the degree of recirculation has been found to be 
significantly lower. The greatest effect is obtained by combined  
 
directing of the air inlet opening and the combustion gas discharge 
opening. It has been found that in that situation the recirculation is 
limited to 5% with a level

Combined burner air supply and combustion gas system (1), 
comprising an air supply pipe (2) and accommodated therein a combustion 

gas discharge pipe (3), which pipes at one end are provided with 
connections shut off from each other, for connection to the air supply 

and the combustion gas discharge respectively of a burner, and the 
opposite-lying outside ends of which open out into the environment and 

form an air inlet opening (12, 15) and a combustion gas discharge opening 
(6), the combustion gas discharge pipe running past the air supply pipe, 

characterized in that the air supply opening (12, 15) and/or the 
combustion gas discharge opening (6) open out radially on the periphery 

thereof into the environment only at one axial side of the combination 
(1), and can be rotated about the longitudinal axis of the combination 

(1), for purposes of orientation relative to the prevailing air flow in 
the environment under the influence of wind orientation means (8), 

preferably a weather vane. 
Combination (1) according to Claim 1, wherein at a distance 
from the end of the air supply pipe (2), at the side of the air inlet 

opening (12, 15) an apron (9) is disposed all around the combustion gas 
discharge pipe (3), which apron extends in the direction of the air 

supply pipe (2) and grips around it, and which apron (9) also has over no 
more than half its periphery an area with one or more air inlet openings 

(12, 15), while said apron (9) is rotatable about the longitudinal axis 
of the combination (1). 
Combination (1) according to Claim 2, wherein the apron (9) 
grips loosely around the outer casing (13) surrounding the burner air 

supply (2), while at the free bottom edge of the apron (9) a flange (11) 
runs in the direction of the outer casing (13), leaving an air inlet 

opening (12) in said area between itself and the outer casing (13) or 
said apron (9). 
Combination (1) according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein the apron 
(9) is preferably cooperating with the outer casing (13) in a 

substantially fluid tight manner at its lower region, while said apron 
(9) is provided with one or more openings (15) in its circumferential 

wall on a higher level, such as in the area where the combustion gas 
discharge pipe (3) projects past the burner air supply pipe (2). 
Combination according to any of the preceding claims, wherein 
whithin the apron (9) a duct (20) is provided which only partly, 

 
preferably over about half the circumference, extends around the casing 

(13) at the side where the discharge pipe (3) opens out into the 
environment, and which duct (20) is communicating with the environment 

along at least a part of its length and opens out into the air feed pipe 
(2) at or near one or both of its face ends.

both the air inlet opening (12, 15) and the combustion gas discharge 

opening (6) can be rotated about the longitudinal axis of the combination

(2), at the side of which opening (12) the pipe (3) is at least partially 

enclosed by a buffer plate (27), which consequently is situated between
