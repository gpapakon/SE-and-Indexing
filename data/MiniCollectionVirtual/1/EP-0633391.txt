<ABSTRACT>
A sliding sleeve casing tool apparatus (10) for 
use in a casing string in a wellbore comprises a housing 

(58), a communication port (64) and a sliding sleeve (70) 
to open and close port (64). A radioactive source (146) is 

attached to the housing (58), and the orientation of the 
source may be determined by use of a detector apparatus, 

such as a rotational gamma ray detector. The casing valve 
thus may be aligned with the fracture of a zone of interest 

in the well. A plurality of casing valves may be used, with 
at least one having a radioactive source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
completion tools for use in wellbores, and more 
particularly, to a sliding sleeve casing tool. It is known that sliding sleeve type casing valves 
can be placed in the casing of a well to provide selective 
communication between the casing bore and subsurface 
formation adjacent to the casing valve. One such casing 
valve is shown in our U.S. Patent No. 4,991,654 (Brandell et 
al.), which represents the prior art as referred to in the pre-characterising portion of claim 1. 
The casing valve includes an outer housing with a 
sliding sleeve. First and second seals define a sealed 
annulus within the housing. A latch is disposed in the 
sealed annulus for latching the sliding valve in its first 
and second positions. The housing has a plurality of 
housing ports defined therein and the sliding sleeve has a 
plurality of sleeve ports defined therein. A third seal 
disposed between the sleeve and housing isolates all of the 
housing ports from all of the sleeve ports when the sleeve 
is in its first position relative to the housing. When the 
sleeve is moved to its second position relative to the 
housing, it is aligned so that the sleeve ports are in 
registry with the housing ports. A positioning tool, such 
as that disclosed in our U.S. Patent No. 4,979,561 (Szarka),  
 
is used to position the sleeve in the casing valve. Once 
the sliding sleeve in the casing valve is moved to its 
second position, fluid may be jetted through the jetting 
tool as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,029,644. The jetting 
tool is connected to a rotatable connection to the 
positioning tool. Another of our casing valves has a sliding sleeve 
with a selective latch profile, and a positioning tool has a 
corresponding latch profile so that the positioner block 
will latch only in the profile in the casing valve and not 
engage anything else in the casing string. These prior casing valves have worked well, but 
when positioned may not be optimally aligned with an 
existing downhole fracture in the wellbore. Typically, 
these casing valves are currently run into the wellbore with 
four ports placed approximately 90Â° apart. The ports are 
placed adjacent to the zone of interest with no means of 
placing a port in the plane of the fracture. The resulting 
flow path between the port and fracture, when pumping a 
sand-laden fluid, may thus be quite circuitous and cause 
fracture tortuosity and possible screen-out of the fracture. 
Higher than necessary pump pressures may also be encountered
