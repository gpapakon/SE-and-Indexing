<ABSTRACT>
Of the type that links a set of base stations (2) with a base 
station controller (1) by means of unidirectional transmission lines 

(10). These base stations communicate by radio with at least one mobile 
terminal (3) making use of time division multiple access techniques. 
Communications between any base station (2) and its base station 
controller (1) over unidirectional transmission lines (10) make use of 

a frame structure with the same bit rate as that of the radio link 
between the base stations (2) and the mobile terminals (3), and in 

which the assembly formed by the guard field and the synchronisation 
field is replaced by a reduced synchronisation field and a control 

field to carry out the interchange of control and/or signalling 
information between the base station (2) and its base station 

controller (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a communications subsystem between base
stations, that form radio links with mobile terminals using TDMA
procedures, and base station controllers; this communications subsystem
being implemented by means of unidirectional transmission lines.It is of special application in mobile systems and in cordless
data transmission and telephony systems, like the DECT system (Digital
European Cordless Telecommunications).In any communications structure for cellular telephony, it is well
known how a set of base stations are used to communicate by radio with
the mobile terminals that form part of the system, these stations being
connected to a base station controller which manages their operation.This is explained in the article "Sistemas de Movilidad Local" by
L. Martinez, published in the Revista Española de Electrónica, May
1993, pages 34-39.In this publication various architectures are shown for cordless
subscriber loops consisting of mobile terminals, base stations and
various types of switches that perform the function of base station
controller, for example the cordless private branch exchange of figure
6, page 37, which, in addition to being connected to base stations,
also permits connection with standard and extended service telephone
sets.The connections between the private branch exchange and the base
stations are made, as indicated on page 39 of the article mentioned, by
means of twisted wire pairs over which data are transmitted at 2048
kb/s (CCITT Recommendation G-702).Under these circumstances, although not stated in the article
mentioned, there is a clear need for an interface conversion which
implies the availability of associated subsystems for clock generation,
temporary storage memories in which the read/write processes for
transmission frequency conversion take place, which, in turn, produces
in a small delay that has to be taken into account, etc. As a result, 
the complexity of the equipment, its cost, and the delays produced in interface
conversions that are made in the communications process between the private
branch exchanges and the base stations increase considerably.Document COMMUNICATION AND TRANSMISSION, vol.14, no.1, 1992,
pages 21 - 28, teaches a base station subsystem architecture at least presents
one or more base stations, including the radio and signalling equipment needed
to handle traffic within a cell, a base station controller which controls all the cells
comprising the area of coverage of the base stations subsystem.The base station manages the

A METHOD FOR COMMUNICATING BETWEEN BASE
STATIONS AND BASE STATION CONTROLLERS IN BURST

COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS,
 in which each base station (2) establishes
a radio link with at least one mobile terminal (3) making use of time division

multiple access techniques in the air interface, the frame of which includes a
series of bursts that comprise a guard field (G), a synchronisation field (S1)

and an information field (D) and in which the communications between base
stations (2) and base station controllers (1) are made by means of

unidirectional transmission lines (10); 
characterised
 in that
 the method
further comprises the steps of:


Generating a frame structure with the same bit rate as that of the radio link
between said base station (2) and said mobile terminals (3),

Replacing of the assembly formed by said guard field (G) and said
synchronisation field (S1) by the assembly formed by a reduced

synchronisation field (S2) and a control field (C) to carry out the interchange
of control and/or signalling information between said base station (2) and its

base station controller (1).
The method according to claim 1; 
characterised
 in
that
 said base station controller (1) includes a clock frequency which
generates a single master clock for transmitting information in both directions

between said base station controller (1) and said base stations (2).
The method according to claim 1; 
characterised
 in
that
 said control field (C) includes control and/or signalling information in
both the direction from base station controller (1) to base station (2), and in

the direction from base station (2) to its base station controller (1).
The method according to claim 1; 
characterised
 in
that
 said control field (C) includes a protective mechanism against errors in
the unidirectional transmission line (10), in said control field (C).
The method according to claim 4; 
characterised
 in
that
 said control field (C) includes at least two subfields of control
information, wherein one is a replica of the other and each includes a

command area (CA, CB) that contains the control information and a parity bit
(PA, PB) in order to have error detection by means of parity detection; such

that:

if both parity bits (PA,PB) and both command areas (CA,CB) of both subfields
of control information are equal, then both control information subfields

(CA,CB) are considered error-free,
if only one of the parity bits (PA,PB) of either of the control subfields is correct, 
then the control subfield with the correct parity bit is considered to be error-free,

and
if both parity bits (PA,PB) are erroneous, or if both are correct but the
command areas (CA and CB) are not equal, then an error message is

generated by the part receiving the control field (C) mentioned.
