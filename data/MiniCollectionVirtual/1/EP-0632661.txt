<ABSTRACT>
System for receiving and decoding digital signals according to two image definition levels, comprising:   (A) a transmission channel decoding subassembly (2), itself comprising first and second channel decoders (21, 22) and a changeover switch (23) for selecting one of them; (B) a source decoding subassembly (4), for decoding the highest definition level signals or the lowest definition level signals; (C) a device (5) for displaying the decoded signals which are available at the output of this subassembly (4); (D) on a second output of the subassembly (4), a device (61) for error detection during the source decoding, followed, in series, by a decision circuit (7) for controlling the changeover switch according to the output of the said error-detecting device, as well as for controlling the changing of the decoding subassembly from one of the two source decoding modes to the other.   Application: television signal receivers according to the MPEG standard.

<CLAIMS>
A system for receiving and decoding digital signals in accordance with
two image definition levels, comprising a series arrangement of:


(A) a sub-assembly (2) for decoding the transmission channel in
accordance with a first mode, comprising a first channel decoder (21) for the signals of

the higher definition level and, in parallel therewith, a second channel decoder (22) in
accordance with a second mode for the signals of the lower definition level, and a

switch (23) for selecting one of these decoders;
(B) a source decoding sub-assembly (4) for decoding the signals of the
higher definition level in a first mode and the signals of the lower definition level in a

second mode, which signals are supplied by a first output of the channel decoding sub-assembly;
(C) a device (5) for displaying the signals thus decoded;

characterized in that it also comprises:

(D) at the output of the source decoding sub-assembly, a device (61) for
detecting errors during source decoding, followed, in series, by a decision circuit (7)

for controlling the switch in accordance with the output signal of said error detection
device, as well as for controlling the change-over of the source decoding sub-assembly

from one of the two decoding modes to the other.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it comprises in
series, between said channel and source decoding sub-assemblies, a demultiplexing

device (3) which, for a plurality of signal sequences having a similar definition level,
separates the data corresponding to each of these sequences, respectively, by means of a

first output of said demultiplexing device.
A system as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that it comprises, at a
second output of the demultiplexing device, a second device (62) for detecting errors

during demultiplexing, whose output is connected to a corresponding input of the
decision circuit.
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it 
comprises, at a second output of the channel decoding sub-assembly, a third device (63)

for detecting errors during decoding of the channel, whose output is connected to a
corresponding input of the decision circuit.
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it
comprises means for inverse control of the selection switch (23) for returning to the

mode of decoding the signals having the higher definition level.
