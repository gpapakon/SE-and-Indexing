<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of lining surfaces subjected 
to corrosion in electrochemical cells, especially chlorine 

alkali cells, but also chlorate cells, e.g. in cell covers (2) 
to chlorine alkali cells. The cell cover (2) in question is 

provided with a prefabricated titanium lining (1) which covers 
all surfaces on the cell cover which during operation come 

into contact with the process liquids which are corrosive or 
are in any other way chemically aggressive. The titanium 

lining is prefabricated in dimensions corresponding to the 
measurements of the cell cover, and are mounted in situ at the 

plant by means of clamping joints. To protect the titanium in 
the lining from corrosion it is given an anodic potential via 

a resistance which is connected to a point having anodic 
potential. Exposed parts may also be protected by noble metal 

oxide or noble metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for covering or
lining surfaces of electrochemical cells subjected to
corrosion, especially chlorine-alkali cells, but also chlorate
cells. It also relates to a device for achieving such
protection.Today, the most usual way of protecting parts of electrochemical
cells subjected to corrosion is to line them with
polymer materials. For chlorine cells various forms of hard
rubber are the most common materials. For pipes, polyester
reinforced with fibre glass is commonly used.These materials, however, wear out in the aggressive
environment of the cells, and must be replaced by new linings
after a certain time, about 10-15 years.It has also been shown that the polymer materials, when they
are subjected to high chlorine activities, form highly chlorinated
organic compounds such as hexachlorobenzene and various
dioxines. These compounds are formed by the reaction between
chlorine and the various compounds in the said construction
material. Analyses of the environment in the vicinity of
chlorine factories have shown increased levels of said
environmentally burdening substances.Thus, there is a need for corrosion protection of a different
type which does not generate such environmentally destructive
substances.Titanium is one of the few materials known which is not reactive
in the environment which exists in the anode chamber of a
chlorine alkali cell. It would, therefor, be an excellent
alternative for effective corrosion protection. There is today a technique which makes use of titanium for
corrosion protection for cell covers of chlorine-alkali cells.
According to this technique the cell cover in need of renovation
is sent to a workshop where, by means of a special welding
technique, a titanium cover is attached onto the steel of
the cell cover. Since titanium cannot easily be welded onto
steel, special welding methods are required, which cannot be
carried out just anywhere. Before the titanium is welded on,
the cell cover must be released from old hard rubber in order
to obtain a clean steel surface, which is a time-consuming
and, to a certain extent, an environmentally destructive
procedure, due to, i.a. the use of pyrolysis to release the
rubber. During this process mercury, for example, remaining on
the rubber, as well as possibly existing dioxines may be
released. Not even after cleaning the rubber very carefully
before the pyrolysis may one be sure that all the environmentally
dangerous materials have been removed. Another method
used for removing rubber is the
