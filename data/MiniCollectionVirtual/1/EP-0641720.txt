<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a holder (10) for dosing accessories (12, 13) fixable to a bottle (14). This holder (10) includes a front wall (16), a rear wall (18), two side walls (20, 22), an open top end (24) and a bottom end (26), and has a housing (28) adapted to receive, at least partially, a dosing accessory (12, 13) engaged via the said open top end (24). The housing (28) is delimited by the front, rear and side walls which are made in a single piece. The rear wall is capable of being glued to the bottle and, like the side walls, can be deformed elastically for fitting to bottles of different curvature.

A case (10) for a dosing accessory (12, 13) adapted to be fixed 
on a bottle (14), comprising a front wall (16), a rear wall (18), two side 

walls (20, 22), an open upper end (24) and a lower end (26), said case 
having a housing (28) adapted to receive, at least partially, a dosing 

accessory (12, 13) engaged via said open upper end (24), the housing 
(28) being delimited by the front wall (16), the rear wall (18) and the side 

walls (20, 22), said walls (16, 18, 20, 22) being integral with one another, 
the rear wall (18) being capable of being adhered to the bottle (14) and 

being elastically deformable to fit bottles of different curvatures,
 
   characterised in that the front wall (16) is closed and 

substantially rigid, and in that the rear wall (18) and the side walls (20, 22) 
are elastically deformable to fit bottles of different curvatures. 
The case according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
thickness of the front wall (16) is greater than the thickness of the side 

walls (20, 22) and than the thickness of the rear wall (18). 
The case according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that, in the non-deformed state, the rear wall (18) has a mean radius of 

curvature greater than the mean radius of curvature of the assembly 
constituted by the front wall (16) and the side walls (20, 22). 
The case according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that it further comprises two elastically deformable tongues (30a, 30b) 

extending in the housing (28), substantially towards the rear wall (18), 
separating said housing (28) into a front part (28a) and a rear part (28b), 

each one of said tongues (30a, 30b) having a first side (32a, 32b) that is 
fast with the case (10) at the level of the join of the front wall (16) with one 

of the side walls (20, 22) and a second free side (34a, 34b). 
The case according to claim 4, characterised in that the rear 
part (28b) of the housing (28) is adapted to receive a first dosing 

accessory (13) capable of being maintained in place against the rear wall 
by the elastically deformable tongues (30a, 30b). 
The case according to one of claims 4 and 5, characterised in 
that the front part (28a) of the housing is adapted to receive a second 

dosing accessory (13) capable of being maintained in place against the 
front wall (16) by the elastically deformable tongues (30a, 30b).  

 
The case according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the lower end (26) is open and has means (36, 38) for retaining the 

dosing accessory (12, 13). 
The case according to claim 7, characterised in that the means 
for retaining the dosing accessory (12, 13) comprise a first stop member 

(36) projecting towards the inside of the housing (28) from the rear wall 
(18), and a second stop member (38) projecting towards the inside of the 

housing (28) from the front wall (16). 
The case according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that it comprises tabs (40) extending it downwardly beyond the lower 

end (26) thereof. 
The case according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the rear wall (18) is at least partially coated with an adhesive 

substance (42), and in that it comprises a removable protective film (44) 
initially covering said adhesive substance (42).
