<ABSTRACT>
Novel calibration solutions are provided which are useful, for example, with sensor assemblies used for analysis of CO2, and optionally, for concurrent analysis of O2, especially in combination infusion fluid delivery/blood chemistry analysis systems which include a sensor assembly with each of the assembly electrodes mounted in an electrode cavity in the assembly. The analysis system used in the practice of the present invention typically includes provision for delivering infusion fluid and measuring blood chemistry during reinfusion of the physiological fluid at approximately the same flow rates. The invention calibration solutions are useful for calibrating an array of sensors capable of simultaneously measuring a number of blood chemistry parameters, including the partial pressures (tensions) of carbon dioxide and oxygen, pH (hydrogen ion), sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, ionized magnesium, chloride, glucose, lactate and hematocrit, in body fluids. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of an infusible intravenous solution to facilitate calibration on a regular basis for every individual sensor in a sensor assembly, which is in constant fluid communication with the body regardless of whether the sensors are (ex vivo) or (in vivo).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the diagnostic 
testing of body fluids, typically in conjunction with the 
infusion of fluids. In a particular aspect, the 
invention relates to calibration solutions useful with 
low-cost, disposable, sensor assemblies used in automated 
bedside monitors. Low-cost, disposable, electrochemical electrode 
assemblies have special utility as part of infusion fluid 
delivery systems commonly used in hospital patient care. 
Such systems infuse nutrients, medications, and the like 
directly into the patient at a controlled rate and in 
precise quantities for maximum effectiveness. Infusion 
fluid delivery systems are connected to a patient at an 
intravenous (IV) port, in which a hollow needle/catheter 
combination is inserted into a blood vessel of the 
patient and thereafter an infusion fluid is introduced 
into the vessel at a controlled rate, typically using a 
peristaltic pump. Blood chemistry monitoring systems 
that are combined with infusion delivery systems of this 
kind use the IV port to periodically withdraw a blood 
sample, perform measurements of blood ion concentrations 
and the like, and then discard the blood or reinfuse it 
into the patient. The system then resumes delivery of 
the infusion fluid. Such combined infusion fluid delivery and blood 
chemistry monitoring systems include an infusion line and 
catheter through which the infusion fluid is provided to  
 
the patient and blood samples are withdrawn. The 
infusion line incorporates an electrode assembly having 
electrochemical sensors that are periodically exposed to 
the blood samples and thereby provide electrical signals 
to an analyzer for conversion into corresponding blood 
chemistry data. A control unit periodically halts 
delivery of the infusion fluid for a brief interval, 
during which time a blood sample is withdrawn from the 
patient into the infusion line and routed to the 
electrode assembly, which then generates the electrical 
signals. After the electrical signals have been received 
by the analyzer, the control unit disposes of the blood 
or reinfuses the blood sample into the patient, and the 
flow of infusion fluid is resumed. The electrode assembly typically, among other 
types of electrochemical sensors, includes a reference 
electrode and a plurality of sensing electrodes (sensors) 
that are each sensitive to a particular ion or species of 
interest. All of the electrodes are typically embedded 
in the base of the electrode assembly. For example, 
ion-sensitive electrodes (ISE) generate
