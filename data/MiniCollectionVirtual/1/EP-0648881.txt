<ABSTRACT>
In the squeezing-off of tubular knitted material spread out essentially round, the operating elements of the spreading-out device are exposed to considerable forces during the squeezing process. These forces necessitate a corresponding dimensioning of the operating elements and consequently higher costs in comparison with a known spreading-out device of lightweight construction. The object of the solution according to the invention is to avoid these cost increases, without at the same time bringing about an impairment of the squeezing process. The solution is characterised in that pairs of squeezing rollers 23 are arranged on the outer tube 19a of the central carrier 19 stationarily between the mutually spaced supports 20, 21 of the spreading-out rollers 12 and the rotary-driven squeezing roller 26 having the piston/cylinder unit 27 is positioned diametrically opposite each pair of squeezing rollers 23, in such a way that the squeezing forces "F" directly support one another.

Combined expanding and squeezing 
apparatus, especially for tubular knit goods, 

comprising 

a frame (5) having an expander device, 
the frame (5) accommodating a bearing ring (29), 

which is arranged in a horizontal plane and which is 
driven in rotation, and also a pair of rotationally 

driven bearing rings (28), the bearing ring pair 
(28) being arranged in the horizontal plane parallel 

to the first-mentioned bearing ring (29), and all 
the bearing rings enclosing the expander device, 
piston-cylinder units (27) which, spaced 
apart from one another on a divided circle, are 

connected to the bearing ring pair (28), each 
piston-cylinder unit (27) being so connected to a 

rotationally driven squeezing roller (26) that each 
squeezing roller (26) can exert a pressing force on 

a squeezing roller pair (23) arranged opposite the 
squeezing roller (26) and connected to the expander 

device, 
the expander device held rotatably in the 
frame (5) and having a central carrier (19) of 

telescoping form which comprises an outer tube (19a) 
and an inner tube (19b) which can be pushed in the 

manner of a telescope into the outer tube (19a), and 
there being articulated to the outer and inner tubes 

(19a, 19b) radially expandable supports (20, 21) of 
which the free ends are connected to one another by 

at least one longitudinal connector (31), the 
longitudinal connector (31) accommodating at least 

one rotatably mounted expander roller (12), and each 
squeezing roller pair (23) forming, together with 

the separate squeezing roller (26), a squeezing 
device (13), which squeezing devices (13) have an 

inclined position relative to the longitudinal axis 
of the central carrier (19), characterised in that 

the squeezing roller pairs (23) are rotatably  
 

mounted on the outer tube (19a) of the central 
carrier (19) in stationary receiving members (24, 

25), and the rotationally driven squeezing roller 
(26), together with the piston-cylinder unit (27), 

is so positioned, diametrically opposite each 
squeezing roller pair (23), on the respective 

bearing ring of the bearing ring pair (28) that the 
squeezing forces (F) emanating from the piston-cylinder 

units (27) are directly and mutually 
supporting. 
Combined expanding and squeezing 
apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in 

that the squeezing roller pairs (23) are rotatably 
mounted between an upper and a lower receiving 

member (24, 25) arranged on the outer tube (19a) of 
the central carrier (19).
