<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a torque nut or torque screw, i.e. a fastening device with fastening threads, i.e. threads which are operative for the fastening function of the device, and with an indication means which is integrated in the device to be released at a predetermined tightening torque. The invention comprises an inner fastening member (7) having said fastening threads (8) and outside of the inner fastening member an outer female member (10) rotatable by means of a spanner, a pair of pliers, a screw driver, or other tool, said female member being connected to the inner fastening member by means of a coupling (13) having a sufficient strength to transfer to the inner fastening member a torque of a magnitude for which the fastening device is designed. The outer female member (10) is provided, at the tightening of the coupling, to be released and rotated relative to the inner fastening member (7) but not until the predetermined torque is exceeded. The coupling between the outer female (10) and the inner fastening member (7) consists of a conical screw coupling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a torque nut or torque screw, i.e. a fastening device with 
fastening threads, i.e. threads which are operative for the fastening function of the device 
and with an indication which is integrated in the device to be released at a 
predetermined tightening torque, comprising an inner fastening member having said 
fastening threads and outside of the inner fastening member an outer female member 
rotatable by means of a spanner, a pair of pliers, a screw driver, or other tool, said female 
member being connected to the inner fastening member by means of a coupling having a 
sufficient strength to transfer to the inner fastening member a torque of the magnitude 
for which the fastening device is designed, and wherein the outer female member is 
provided, at the tightening of the coupling, to be released and rotated relative to the 
inner fastening member but not until the predetermined torque is exceeded. It is in many situations desired to be able to tighten nuts and screws with a certain 
predetermined torque. For this purpose special-type tools have been designed which are 
released or which are provided with a signalling device, which is released when a set 
torque has been achieved. These tools, however, are comparatively expensive and are 
not at hand in normal tool kits. Therefore, there is a need for torque nuts and torque 
screws which can be tightened by means of conventional tools, such as conventional 
spanners, pliers, screw drivers and the like, wherein the torque nut and the torque screw, 
respectively, shall be able to take over the releasing or indication function of the 
dynamometric tool (torque tool). Such devices have been suggested in the 
past, e.g. through US-A- 3 667 339 which describes a friction controlled torque threaded fastening which depends upon the static coefficient of friction between contacting surfaces of two parts of the fastening and the normal forces which retain said surfaces in engagement with one another. In US-A-3,841,177 such friction means is replaced by screw threads. The purpose of the invention is to provide torque nuts and torque screws which can take 
over the "indication function" of the dynamometric tool, i.e. which can be tightened with 
a predetermined torque by means of a conventional tool. This can be achieved therein 
that the coupling between the outer female member and the inner fastening member 
consists of a conical screw coupling. The predetermined torque can be set by a certain tightening of the screw coupling. The

the tightening of the coupling, to be released and rotated relative to the inner fastening 

member (7) but not until the predetermined torque is exceeded, 
characterized
 in 
that the coupling between the outer female member (10) and the inner fastening member 

(7) consists of a conical screw coupling. 
The torque nut or torque screw according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the outer female 
member (10) consists of a nut, and that the predetermined torque is set by a certain 

tightening of the screw coupling between the outer nut (10) and the inner fastening 
member (7). 
The torque nut or torque screw according to claim 2, wherein the inner fastening member is an inner 
nut (7), 
characterized
 in that the inner nut (7) is longer than the outer nut (10). 
The torque nut or torque screw according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the inner nut in 
both of its ends extends beyond the outer nut, and that it, in its outer end, has an 

outwardly directed flange (12) or other abutment means against which the outer nut (10) 
abuts and is tightly screwed with such a force that the joint between outer nut and the 

inner fastening member can be released only bv the application of the said predetermined 
torque.
