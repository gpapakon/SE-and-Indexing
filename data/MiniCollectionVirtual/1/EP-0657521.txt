<ABSTRACT>
A water-repellent earth material having grains formed with 
silicone coating is made by mixing the earth material with an 

emulsion of silicone oil in water and drying. The earth 
material may be selected from the group consisting of soil, 

sand, gravel, pebbles, silicon-containing combustion ash of 
household refuses and silicon-containing combustion ash of 

industrial refuses. The earth material may be used to form a 
water-repellent ground surface layer (2a), a water-repellent 

underground layer or a water-repellant enclosure for various 
purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to earth materials, and 
more particularly to an earth material which is treated to have 
water repellency. The present invention also relates to methods 
of making and using a water-repellent earth material. Conventionally, unwanted weeds at various sites (e.g. non-paved 
median strip of a highway, an athletic ground, or a tee 
ground of a golf course) have been removed manually or by using 
a mower or by spraying a chemical (herbicide). However, manual 
or machine mowing is laborious and must be repeated 
periodically, whereas the chemical weed removal gives rise to a 
pollution problem in addition to requiring periodical 
repetition of the same operation. On the other hand, it is often necessary to adjust the 
ground or earth condition in various ways. For instance, it is 
preferable that sports grounds be adjusted to have good water 
drainage. Conversely, grounds in scarcely rainy areas need be 
adjusted to have good water retention for growing various 
plants. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a water-repellant earth material which is non-harmful 
and can be used for various purposes including e.g. prevention 
of weed growing, facilitation of ground drainage, or improvement 
of ground water retention. The present invention also seeks to provide a method of  
 
making a water-repellant earth material. The present invention further provides various ways of 
using a water-repellant earth material. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a water-repellant earth material having grains formed 
with silicone coating. The earth material may be selected from 
the group consisting of soil, sand (either pit sand or sea 
sand), gravel, pebbles, silicon-containing combustion ash of 
household refuses and silicon-containing combustion ash of 
industrial refuses. According to another aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided a method of making a water-repellant earth 
material comprising the steps of: drying a start earth 
material; preparing an emulsion of silicone oil in water; 
soaking the earth material with the emulsion; and heating the 
soaked earth material for drying. The water-repellant earth material thus made may be simply 
spread over the surface of a selected plain ground (namely, 
where no plants are grown) to form a water-repellant surface 
layer. Alternatively, plants may be grown on the ground, and 
the surface layer may have openings only at the plants. According to another use example, the
