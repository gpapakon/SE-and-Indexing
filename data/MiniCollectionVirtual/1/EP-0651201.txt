<ABSTRACT>
The casing (1) contains a member (8) necessary for the electrical supply of at least one lighting lamp (9). In the use position (at the top) a closure grid (2) is placed in front of the casing (1), outside the latter. According to the invention, a free space is provided in the casing (1) which is sufficient so that, in the absence of a lamp, that is to say in the storage and transport position (at the bottom), the closure grid can be replaced in the casing (1).

A luminaire comprising a housing (1) which contains at least one
member (8) necessary for the electrical supply of at least one lamp (9) for lighting

purposes, and provided with an opening for the emission of the light and a closing
lattice (2) which is to be placed at the outside of the housing (1) in the operational

position, in front of said opening, characterized in that a free space is provided in the
housing (1) sufficiently large for the closing lattice (2) to be accommodated in the

housing (1) in the absence of a lamp (9).
A luminaire as claimed in the preceding claim, characterized in that the
closing lattice (2) comprises at least one recessed portion which is adapted so as to fit

the shape of a member (8) when the lattice (2) is accommodated in the housing (1).
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the inner wall of the housing is reflecting.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the closing lattice (2) comprises profiles (4) which reflect light.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the closing lattice (2) is of the louvre type comprising slats (10).
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that it comprises a decorative cover (5) for hiding the member (8) for the electrical

supply, which decorative cover is fixed by means which render it possible to dismount
and remount it without tools.
A luminaire as claimed in the preceding claim, whose closing lattice is of
the louvre type comprising slats, characterized in that the decorative cover (5) is

provided with slots (6) in which the slats of the louvre can lock themselves when the
louvre is inserted in the housing (1).
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, which is of a
type to be incorporated in a ceiling made of suspended elements, with profiled supports

comprising a vertical profile portion and a horizontal profile portion (3) serving as a
support on which the ceiling elements are placed, characterized in that the closing lattice 

is placed on a horizontal profile portion (3) so as to take the place of a ceiling element.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, of the type
which is to be incorporated in a ceiling made of suspended elements, with profiled

supports (3) comprising a vertical profile portion and a horizontal profile portion
serving as a support on which the ceiling elements are placed, characterized in that it is

provided with means (Fig. 2) for placing the housing (1) on top of said vertical profile
portion.
An assembly of a luminaire as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims and its packaging, characterized in that the interior dimensions of the packaging

are substantially those of the housing such that the luminaire can be placed in said
packaging with the closing lattice (2) accommodated in the housing (1).
