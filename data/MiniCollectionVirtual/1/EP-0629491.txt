<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a moulded object (1) which can be manufactured from a core (2) and outer parts (3) of expandable plastic granules, and also the method and the apparatus for manufacturing it. In the case of the moulded object (1), the core (2) may be covered by the outer parts (3) on all sides, with the result that the core (2) can be manufactured from inexpensive material of less good properties, while the outer parts (3) have better properties. The moulded object (1) can be manufactured advantageously with a core (2) of inexpensive recycled material and outer parts (3) of more expensive virgin material. The durability of the bonding of the parts (1, 2 and 3) is outstanding, since it is produced by "thermal welding". The manufacturing method for the moulded object is less time-consuming than in the case of methods according to the prior art. Moulded objects according to the invention can be used predominantly in the construction industry or as parts of packaging.
