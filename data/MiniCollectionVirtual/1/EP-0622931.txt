<ABSTRACT>
In a computer system including a plurality of interlinked computers, 
annotations made on the display of one computer are replicated on the displays 

of the other computers. The annotations may be made in a shared window 
which is a display for an application program running on one of the computers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating a plurality of interlinked computers. Modern telephone systems allow multiple parties at different locations to 
hold a conference. However, telephone conferences do not provide all of the 
conveniences of a face-to-face conference, where participants all meet at a 
common table in a meeting room. For example, in a meeting room, participants 
can view an object of interest, such as a drawing or a product. Such viewing is 
not possible in a telephone conference. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved electronic 
conferencing system. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided 
a method of operating a computer system, including a plurality of interlinked 
computers, characterized by the steps of: running a message-driven operating 
system on each computer; and when any user of a computer generates a message 
of a predetermined type, replicating the message at the other computers. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by telephone lines. Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in Figures 3-14. 
In the example, a calculator program is operated, and annotated, by various 
parties. Figure 3 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 4 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 5 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
operate the calculator, in Application mode. Figure 6 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
operate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode. Figure 7 illustrates how the system responds when a host user attempts to 
annotate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode. Figure 8 illustrates how the system responds to a host user when in View 
mode.  Figure 9 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user attempts 
to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 10 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user 
attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 11 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Application mode. Figure 12 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode. Figure 13 illustrates how the

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a computer system, including a plurality of 
interlinked computers, characterized by the steps of: running a message-driven 

operating system on each computer; and when any user of a computer generates 
a message of a predetermined type, replicating the message at the other 

computers. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized by the steps of 
capturing parameters indicative of the location of a cursor image at one of said 

computers; sending the parameter to the other computers; and generating a 
cursor image on the other computers, based on the parameters. 
A method of operating a computer system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by the steps of drawing a graphic image on a 

display of one of the computers, in response to messages; transmitting similar 
messages to other computers; and causing said graphic image to be displayed at 

the other computers. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
by the steps of displaying visual data in windows of the displays of said 

computers; replicating at least one window in all of said displays; and allowing a 

user to prevent replication of a selected window on the user's display. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
by the steps of running an application program on one of said computers acting 

as a host computer and allowing a selected remote computer to issue commands 
to said application program. 
A computer system for carrying out a method according to any one of 
the preceding claims, including a plurality of interlinked computers, and control 

means adapted, when any user of a computer generates a message of a 
predetermined type, to replicate the message at the other computers.
