<ABSTRACT>
A method of constructing monolithic trench walls, 
sills and hard standings, comprises the following 

steps in a continuous cycle: 

a) excavating a trench or channel (13) by means of 
a cutter (14) fitted to a moving excavating machine 

(10); 
b) extracting the soil excavated in the trench 
(13); 
c) transferring the extracted soil onto a conveyor 
belt (21) interposed between the cutter (14) and a 

container (22, 34) provided with disgregating 
members (23, 35) for crumbling the extracted soil 

and mixing it with a consolidating agent so as to 
form with the extracted and crumbled soil a plastic 

and homogeneous mix; 
d) casting continuously the mix from said 
container (22) to the excavated trench or channel 

(13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an apparatus 
and method of constructing monolithic trench walls, 
sills and hard standings. Methods and apparatuses for constructing 
continuous monolithic trench walls are known from 
Italian Patent applications Nos. 3550-A/89 and 3551-A/89 (EP-A-0 407 934), 
in the name of the same Applicant, in which an 
equipment comprising a cutter having a vertical 
chain is used. The cutter is inserted in the soil 
down to the required depth, and the apparatus 
supporting the cutter is advanced, thereby 
excavating a trench in the direction of advancement. 
The walls of the trench are sustained by a formwork 
following the cutter. A grout supplying hose is 
inserted in the formwork, such that the apparatus 
leaves a trench filled with cement grout in 
advancing along a predetermined path. It is an object of this invention to construct 
monolithic and continuous cement trench walls and 
sills, preferably but not exclusively for 
impermeabilization purposes utilising as aggregate 
the same soil material that is excavated. After  
 
being extracted, the soil is mixed to a 
consolidating agent, preferably cement, with a 
possible addition of water and concrete additives. 
In mixing, the soil has to be crumbled finely in 
order to have a homogeneous mix in which the 
aggregate granules remain covered with the 
consolidating mix. Big uncrushed sods in the 
finished work would compromise impermeability and 
cut down the final resistance of work, and therefore 
have to be carefully avoided. Re-cycling of extracted soil has two purposes: 
that of saving addition of conventional aggregate, 
such as sand and gravel, avoiding any problem 
relative to their cost, availability and 
transportation; that of eliminating problems relative to 
elimination of the excavated material, with a 
consequent saving of time and work. It is another object of this invention to 
provide a method of constructing concrete works in 
which the percentage of the various components 
(water, consolidating agent, aggregate) can be 
controlled by an operator at any time who can 
promptly adjust the percentages in order to 
construct works having maximum structural strength.  
 An apparatus for constructing piles with 
consolidated soil using excavated aggregate is known 
from Italian Patent applications No. 3592-A/89 and 
No. 3488-A/90 (EP-A-0 411 560) in the name of the same Applicant. 
This apparatus comprises a disgregating and mixing 
tool mounted to the lower end of a rotating vertical 
rod. At first, the tool is
