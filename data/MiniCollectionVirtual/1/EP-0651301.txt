<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electronic clock having a time-keeping device and analogue display means which are advanced by the time-keeping device in a stepwise fashion corresponding to the passage of time (time lapse) via an electric drive. The clock has an input device via which the user can input a specific desired clock time for the purpose of setting the time on the clock. The value of this desired clock time is stored after inputting in a register for the desired clock time. The clock has a reference device in which an actual clock time corresponding to a reference setting of the analogue display means is stored in a reference time register. After activation of said reference device, the analogue display means are moved into the relevant reference position when the position of the analogue display means deviates from the reference position. The clock has a synchronisation device after the activation of which the analogue display means are moved from the reference position to the desired clock time which is to be set.

<CLAIMS>
An electronic clock with a time-keeping device
(1) and analog indicating means (2) that are advanced in

steps in accordance with the passage of time by the time-keeping
device (1) by means of an electric drive

mechanism (3),
characterized in that
 the clock includes an input device
(4) which can be used by the user for entering a certain

desired time in order to set the time of the clock, whose
value, following entry, is stored in a desired time

register (5), that the clock includes a reference time
device (6) in which an actual time corresponding to a

reference position of the analog indicating means (2) is
stored in a reference time register (14) and after the

activation of which the analog indicating means (2) are
moved to the reference position concerned if the position

of the analog indicating means (2) deviates from the reference
position, and that the clock includes a synchronization

device (7) after the activation of which the
analog indicating means (2) are moved from the reference

position to the desired time to be set.
The electronic clock as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the reference position is stored
digitally by entering on the input device (4) the momentary

actual time as shown by the analog indicating means
(2), and that the synchronization device (7) can be put

into its activated condition by a manual actuating means.
The clock as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the reference time device (6)
controls the electric drive mechanism (3) for the analog 

indicating means (2) in such a way that the latter can be
moved into their reference position by an operator

through selective actuation of a function button (11)
while observing the step-by-step advance of the analog

indicating means (2), and that the synchronization device
(7) is activated by manual actuation of an actuating

means (10) after the reference position is reached.
The clock as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the reference time register (14)
contains a fixed value, that the analog indicating means

(2) are hands, and that the clock has a sensor (12) for
detecting the position of the hands or the train of

wheels by means of which the hands (2) adjust to the reference
time after activation of the reference time device

(6) before the clock time is set by entry of the desired
time on the input device (4) and the subsequent activation

of the synchronization device (7).
The electronic clock as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that
 activation of the reference time
device (6) takes place by applying a supply voltage to

the clock.
The clock as claimed in claim 5,
characterized in that
 the clock has only hours and
minutes hands (2), enabling the hands (2) to be advanced

to the reference position and to the time to be set at a
relatively high speed of advance.
The clock as claimed in claim 6,
characterized in that
 the clock has a 12-hours
indication, that the minutes hand is advanced only every 

minute by this same unit of time, and that the time it
takes for one rotation of the hands (2) through a full

twelve hours when advancing from the reference position
to the time to be set amounts to less than one minute.
