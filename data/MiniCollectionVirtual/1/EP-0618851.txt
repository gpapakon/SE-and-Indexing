<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a material 
removal process and system, and more particularly, to a 
material removal process and system that uses pulsed 
light from a flashlamp, or equivalent pulsed high energy 
light source (such as a laser), to ablate the material to 
be removed; and also uses optical feedback from the 
surface being ablated to determine when the proper amount 
of material has been removed. Material coatings play an important role in 
our manufactured products based society. Coatings 
provide immunity to corrosion, thermal insulation, 
shielding, as well as appearance enhancement, and an aid 
in identification. During the life of many manufactured products, 
such as bridges, aircraft, automobiles, and ships, 
painted coatings require removal and replacement for a 
variety of reasons. For example, refurbishment of the 
paint on aircraft is a regular maintenance item. 
Commercial airlines repaint their aircraft about every 4-5 
years of service. The United States military typically 
repaints its aircraft after three years of service, or 
less. Coatings on the exterior surfaces of large ships 
or bridges require periodic refurbishment in order to 
prevent or inhibit corrosion. The removal of paint from the surfaces of 
aircraft presents special problems. Such surfaces are 
large, irregularly shaped, and relatively delicate. 
Because the surfaces of aircraft are typically 
lightweight aluminum or organically based composite 
materials, such surfaces and the underlying substrates  
 
are particularly susceptible to damage while undergoing 
paint removal that could degrade their structural 
integrity. Many different methods have been used to remove 
painted coatings. One type, the "particle medium blast" 
(PMB) method involves impinging the surface to be 
stripped with particles such as BB's, plastic media, 
steel shot, wheat starch, and/or sand. However, PMB 
methods that are energetic enough by themselves to remove 
hardened coatings such as paint may damage delicate 
surfaces such as are found on aircraft and automobiles if 
they are not carefully managed. For example, if the 
impinging particles dwell too long at one location, the 
impinged surface may become pitted or stress hardened. 
This is especially important with regard to the surfaces 
of aircraft since pitting or stress hardening may change 
the loading on that portion of the aircraft. PMB may 
also damage putty joints often found on aircraft between 
surface plates. It is also known in the art to apply chemical 
compounds to

A system (11) for removing a layer of 
material (24, 26) from a substrate (28), comprising:

ablate said layer (24, 26) of material;
 
   a control circuit (13) that controls said 

flashlamp (14) so that it irradiates a target area on 
said structure with a series of said pulses of radiant 

energy (18) for the purpose of ablating said layer (24, 
26) of material;

of a prescribed color intensity that is different from a 
known color intensity of the layer of material being 

ablated by said pulses of radiant energy; and
