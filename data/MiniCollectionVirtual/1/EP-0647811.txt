<ABSTRACT>
The device is used typically in filling stations to 
connect the hose (3) of a self-service pump to the 

relative gun (2), and comprises a ball-and-socket 
fitting (10) composed of a first outer connecting 

member (4), and a tubular member (5) of which one 
end affords a spherical head (7) accommodated to a 

fluid-tight fit by the first connecting member (4) 
whilst the remaining end affords a sleeve (11) in 

which the tubular shank (13) of a second connecting 
member (6) is insertable, likewise to a fluid-tight 

fit; the sleeve (11) and the second connecting 
member (6) combine to create a pull-release safety 

coupling (18) equipped with an internal valve (16) 
which is designed to close and seal off the second 

connecting member (6) when this becomes separated 
from the sleeve (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device
in combination with a fluid pipeline and a delivery
appliance. Such a device according to the preamble of claim 1 in disclosed in US-A 4 899 792. Given that the device according to the
present invention is advantageously suitable for
application in the art field of fuel vending and
filling stations generally, reference will be made
throughout the specification to this same field of
use, and in particular to adoption of the device as
a means whereby the flexible hose associated with a
familiar "petrol pump" is connected to the relative
gun; the descriptive content of the disclosure is
thus simplified, albeit implying no limitation of
the invention whatever.It is a principal requirement in any type of piped
delivery system to avoid the risk that a failure or
rupture even of one component part might result in
leakage of the conveyed liquid.In the particular instance, for example, of hoses
and guns used typically to dispense fuels such as
petrol or diesel, it is important to make provision 
for the eventuality that the line carrying the fuel
from the pump to the gun may fail or break. Neither
is it unreasonable to envisage trouble of this kind
occurring at installations of the type in question;
it happens often enough, for example, especially in
self-service filling stations, that when a user has
filled up with fuel, the gun is left accidentally
in the filler neck of the vehicle fuel tank and the
vehicle then driven off, dragging the gun forward
and subjecting the gun-and-hose assembly to tensile
and bending stresses of notable intensity, indeed
sufficient to break the connection between gun and
hose: the ensuing and inevitable consequence is a
leakage of fuel, hence the risk of fire and serious
damage to the environment.The hose line in question must in fact be suitably
long and flexible, and easy to handle, so that the
degree of strength obtainable in construction is
limited. It therefore becomes necessary to reduce
the stresses to which the hose may be subjected, or
to incorporate a safety feature whereby the flow of
fuel can be cut off in the event of the hose line
breaking.To reduce stresses while at the same time enhancing
the practical advantages of the self-service pump, 
recourse has been made to a ball-and-socket type of
fitting interposed between the gun and the hose.Considering the entire length of the hose line, in
effect, the point that tends to be subjected to the
greatest bending stresses is precisely that of the
connection to the gun. It is

<CLAIMS>
A device (1) in combination with a fluid pipeline (3)
and a delivery appliance (2), the device being connected between the fluid pipeline and the delivery appliance by means

of a first outer connecting member (4) and a second connecting member (6),
the device comprising


a ball-and-socket fitting (10)
composed of the first outer connecting member (4),

and a tubular member (5) of which one end affords a
spherical head (7) accommodated to a fluid-tight

fit internally of the first connecting member (4)
and the remaining end terminates in a sleeve (11)

designed to accommodate, in a fluid-tight fit, a tubular shank (13) of the
second connecting member (6);
the sleeve (11) and the second connecting
member (6) forming two parts of a pull-release safety

device (18), associated one with another by way of
coupling means (14) designed to yield elastically

and allow a mutual separation of the two parts when
subjected to a predetermined tensile overload;
comprising valve means (16), located
internally of the second connecting member (6), by 

which the selfsame second connecting member is shut
off and sealed fluid-tight when separated from the

sleeve (11),
 
characterized in that said delivery appliance (2) and

said pipeline (3) are respectively furnished with an
axial vent duct (23, 24), wherein the first connecting

member (4) comprises a rigidly associated fitting (25),
connected to the axial vent duct (23) of the delivery

appliance (2) and to a flexible duct (27) positioned
internally of the tubular member (5), and said valve

means (16) are in fluid-tight association with the axial
vent duct (24) of the pipeline (3) and with the flexible

duct (27), and that spring means (29) are interposed
between the duct (24) and a socket (28) of the valve

means (16) in order to operate in such a manner as to
bring about the closure of the valve means (16, without

occasioning the complete withdrawal of the axial vent
duct (24) of the pipeline (3) from the axial socket (28)

of the valve means (16). 
A device as in claim 1, wherein

second connecting member (6) to a fluid-tight fit,
and the valve means (16) are accommodated by the

axial bore (15) of the tubular shank (13) of the

sliding movement so as to enable alternation
between a delivery position in

which axial movement is disallowed and the valve
means (16) are caused to locate in contact with the

bottom of the axial socket (12) of the sleeve (11),
