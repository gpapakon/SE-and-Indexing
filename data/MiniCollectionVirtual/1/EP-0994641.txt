<ABSTRACT>
A solvent, flux or paste transfer unit (100) is made a slide type and
a plurality of nozzles (8) at a head part which suck and hold

components (33) are moved down simultaneously to transfer the
flux to the electronic components. In comparison with an

electronic component mounting method including a transfer
operation whereby the nozzles are lowered one by one by a

conventional electronic component mounting apparatus
equipped with a rotary type solvent, flux or paste transfer unit, a time

for moving the nozzles up, down is shortened and a total
cycle time is reduced, so that production efficiency is

improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
a method for mounting electronic components which carry out
solvent transfer operation for transferring solvent such as
flux, solder paste, or the like to electronic components
requiring the transfer of the solvent at the time when the
components are mounted to objects to be mounted such as
boards or components.Electronic component mounting apparatuses these
days are required to mount electronic components speedily
correctly to electronic circuit boards, with improving
mounting quality.An example of a conventional electronic component
mounting apparatus will be described below with reference
to Figs. 14, 15, and 16.A conventional electronic component mounting
apparatus 10 shown in Fig. 14 comprises a board transfer
device 4 for carrying in and out circuit boards, a front
component feed device 32a and a rear component feed device
32b each having a plurality of component feed units, a head
part 8 with a mechanism that can load desired suction
nozzles, move up and down, and rotate the loaded suction 
nozzles, a board recognition camera 9, an XY robot 5
movable in X and Y directions, an electronic component
image pickup device 2, and a solvent transfer unit 40.The above conventional electronic component
mounting apparatus 10 operates in a manner as follows. The
board transfer device 4 transfers the circuit board to a
mounting position. The XY robot 5 moves the board
recognition camera 9 over the circuit board thereby
checking positions where electronic components are to be
mounted on the circuit board. The XY robot 5 then moves
the board recognition camera 9 over the front component
feed device 32a and the rear component feed part 32b and
recognizes components 33 to be caught. Subsequently, the
XY robot 5 lets the nozzles 8 hold the electronic
components 33. The electronic components 33 sucked and
held by the nozzles 8 are moved to the solvent transfer
unit 40, where the components 33 are moved down one by one
so that the flux 50 is transferred to each of the
components 33. Attitudes of the electronic components 33
held by the nozzles 8 are picked up by the component image
pickup device 2 and measured, thereby judging the result.
When the measured result of the held attitudes of the
components 33 is normal, the components 33 are corrected in
position on the basis of the obtained image information.
Thereafter the XY robot 5 is moved and the electronic 
components 33 are mounted onto the circuit board.As shown in Figs. 14, 15, and 16, in an example
of the
