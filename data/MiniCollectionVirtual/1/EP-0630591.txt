<ABSTRACT>
Plastic ski boot (5) having at least one rigid part (6) capable of transmitting the vibrations from the ski to the skier. In order to dampen these vibrations, this rigid part is equipped with a vibration-damping element (7) consisting of a viscoelastic material associated with a rigid constraint plate. The damping element may be a component part of the boot such as a stiffening piece (6).

Ski boot made of plastic material comprising damping 
means (1,2;61,62) for damping the vibrations of the ski 

transmitted to the skier by the boots, characterised in 
that the damping means are constituted by at least a 

vibration damping element consisting of at least a 
viscoelastic material (2;62) combined with a rigid 

stress piece (1;61) and fixed on the boot. 
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the rigid piece is a stress plate (1) fixed on a rigid 

part (3;6;8) of the boot via the viscoelastic material. 
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the rigid piece is a constitutive part (61) of the 

boot. 
Ski boot according to claim 3, characterised in that 
said constitutive part (61) of the boot is a strip-shaped 

reinforcing piece extending obliquely from one 
side of the sole to the other passing over the heel. 
Ski boot according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the damping element (4) is fixed on the sole. 
Ski boot according to claim 2, comprising a 
reinforcing element (6,8) for stiffening the boot, 

characterised in that the damping element (7) is fixed 
on said reinforcing element.  

 
Ski boot according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the damping element is fixed to the front end of the 

shell and/or to the heel. 
Ski boot according to any of claim 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the rigid piece (1) has a modulus 

of elasticity E greater than 10
4
 MPa and a thickness 
comprised between 0,5 and 2 mm. 
Ski boot according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the viscoelastic material (2) is 

chosen from the group comprising butyl rubbers, 
synthetic elastomers, individually or as mixtures or 

containing fillers.
