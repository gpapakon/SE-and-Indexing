<ABSTRACT>
A blind fastener (2) has a screw threaded bore, enabling 
the fastener to be set in a workpiece (16) by an appropriate 

tool, and a head portion (6) having an external screw thread (8). 
When set in a workpiece (16,22,28) the fastener can be used in a 

variety of ways for the attachment of other workpieces (18,24,30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with blind fasteners 
set in a hole in a workpiece to provide an anchorage for 
other fasteners. Blind fasteners have for many years been widely used to 
secure work pieces together, but are normally not easily 
released if it is desired to separate the workpieces. With 
the increased interest in the recycling of components, and 
the consequent need to be able to dismantle components 
easily, a requirement has arisen for a fastener which 
enables components easily to be secured together and 
released. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
blind fastener to be set in a hole in a work piece which 
will provide an anchorage for other fasteners to enable a 
further workpiece to be releasably secured to the first. The present invention provides a blind fastener for 
setting in a hole in a work piece
 
   which fastener comprises a cylindrical body having a 
through bore, the body comprising
 
   an enlarged head portion having an external screw 
thread
 
   a thin walled intermediate portion
 
   a thicker tail end portion having an internal screw 
thread
 
   the external diameters of the intermediate portion and 
the tail end portion being the same and less than that of 
the head portion
 
   the internal diameters of the bore in the intermediate 
portion and the head portion being the same and greater than 
that of the tail end portion. A blind fastener embodying the invention will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying drawings in 
which  Figure 1 shows a view, in longitudinal section, of a 
fastener embodying the invention; Figures 2, 3, & 4 show uses of the fastener of Figure 1 
when set in a work piece. The blind fastener (Figure 1) is intended for setting 
in a hole in a work piece to provide an anchorage for 
further fasteners, and comprises a cylindrical body portion 
2 having a through bore 4. The body portion 2 comprises an 
enlarged, generally cylindrical, head portion 6 which is 
provided with an external screw thread 8. Extending from 
the head portion 6 is a thin walled intermediate portion 10, 
from which extends a thicker tail end portion 12 which has 
an internal screw thread 14. The external diameters of the intermediate portion 10 
and the tail end portion 12 are the same and are less than 
that of the head portion 8. The internal diameters of the 
bore 4 in the intermediate portion 10 and the head portion 8 
are the same and greater than that of the screw threaded 
bore of the tail end portion 14. The fastener can be set
