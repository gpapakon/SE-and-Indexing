<ABSTRACT>
In a simultaneous voice and data communications system, a voice signal 
is added to a data signal before transmission over the public switched telephone 

network (PSTN). In particular, in every signaling interval, a signal point is selected 
for transmission as a function of both the voice signal and the data signal. Since the 

voice signal is effectively offset by the data signal, compandors normally found in 
the PSTN are not effective in improving the signal to noise ratio of the transmitted 

voice and data signal. Therefore, the voice signal is additionally companded in the 
transmitter before transmission over the PSTN. This additional companding by the 

transmitter improves the signal to noise ratio of the combined voice and data signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications equipment, e.g., 
modems. In particular, this invention relates to the transmission of both voice and 
data signals over the same communications facility at the same time. While voice signals have a large dynamic amplitude range, they have an 
amplitude probability distribution heavily weighted toward zero, i.e., voice is mostly 
very small in amplitude with only occasional bursts to near full scale. To improve 
performance, telecommunications networks, e.g., the public switched telephone 
network (PSTN), employ companders to amplify weak voice signals in relation to 
the large voice signals. This improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) by raising the 
average voice signal level above the noise floor of the communications network. The co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon 
Bremer and Kenneth D. Ko entitled "Simultaneous Analog and Digital 
Communication," Serial No. 08/076505, filed on June 14, 1993, discloses a 
simultaneous voice and data communication system in which voice signals are added 
to two-dimensional Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) data symbols for 
transmission over a communications channel, e.g., the PSTN, to a receiving modem. 
In particular, each data symbol is a reference signal point value to which is added a 
voice signal vector, which represents a voice signal. The addition of the voice signal 
vector to the data symbol results in a signal point being selected that is a function of 
both the selected data symbol and the size of the voice signal vector. Unfortunately, 
since the voice signal is effectively added to the data signal, the voice signal is 
biased with a different offset for each selected data symbol. The PSTN does not 
expect a voice signal with, what is effectively, a DC offset. Consequently, this 
results in low-level voice signals getting no gain from PSTN compandors - which, 
overall, degrades the quality of the voice transmission through the PSTN. Therefore and in accordance with the invention, the voice signal, or 
analog signal, is companded before application to the PSTN. As a result, low-level 
voice signals are amplified and the quality of voice transmission does not degrade. In an embodiment of the invention, a representation of the voice signal 
is first expanded before it is encoded into a sequence of signal points, where each 
signal point is selected from a two-dimensional signal space and represents a voice 
signal vector.  In another embodiment of the invention, the
