<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tool system for use in milling 
operations. The tool system (1) comprises an intermediate 

piece (6) which can be centred in the holder (2) on a milling 
machine, and which is provided with an exchangeable 

milling tool (14). The intermediate piece (6) creates 
distance between the holder (2) and the milling tool (14), 

and the diameter of the intermediate piece is less than the 
diameter of the milling tool (14). 
The milling tool (14) is centred in the end of the intermediate 
piece (6) by means of four symmetrically arranged, 

radially-extending projections (7) which engage with corresponding 
keyways (8) in the milling tool. The projections 

(7) and the keyways (8) ensure repetitional accuracy by 
being ground to fine tolerances, but mounting is made easy 

by the wedge-shape of the keyways (8) and projections (7). 
It is hereby possible to use short milling tools in deep 
holes in workpieces which are to be milled, and to avoid 

the replacement of tools which are only partly worn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tool system for machine tools
and comprises an intermediate piece, a first end of which
has a cylindrical shank which can be centred in the
machine's tool holder and can be secured herein by means of
at least one conical screw directed laterally relative to
said holder, which screw can engage a conical hole in the
intermediate piece, said intermediate piece being provided
with a screw connection oriented in the axis of rotation
of the machine for the fastening of a milling tool.Such a tool system is known from DE-B 2,328,176, where a
milling tool is fastened with a threaded pin and with
transverse key secured by screws, said key contributing to
transmitting torque to the milling tool. Here, the intermediate
piece serves merely as a power transmission means,
when the milling tool directly abuts against the surface-ground
underside of the holder.The disadvantage of the above-mentioned method for securing
milling tools is that the tool must have a length corresponding
to the desired milling depth from the uppermost
surface of the workpiece. Often, only the end part of the
milling tool is utilized, which is quickly worn, and which
as with a tool with integrated cutting edges as on HSS milling
tools necessitates the changing of the whole tool,
even though most of the cutting part of the tool is intact
and usable. The use of long-shanked milling tools is a
relatively expensive solution due to the cost of material,
and also makes it necessary to have tools with different
shank lengths in order to accommodate the need for short
and herewith more rigid milling tools.From DE-A 2,831,660 there is known a tool system for a
machine tool with an adapter which serves as intermediate 
piece between the holder and various cutting tools,
including milling tools. However, this system is aimed only
at creating an easy replacement between different tools and
does not solve the problem of the wearing-down of tools
used for the machining of areas deep down in the workpiece,
because the various adapters proposed as intermediate
pieces are not designed to increase the working depth of
the tool and are wider than the tools. Conseqently, they
cannot be used for the machining of deep-lying and narrow
areas. Centring between adapters and milling tools is
achieved with cylindrical fits.In US-A 5,259,709 there is described a thread-cutting
tool that possibly may be rotated during the
machining of workpieces. The tool's threading tool is
secured with an elongated intermediate piece and a through-going
screw

<CLAIMS>
Tool system (1) for machine tools and comprising an
intermediate piece (6), a first end of which has a

cylindrical shank (18) which can be centred in the
machine's tool holder (2) and can be fastened herein by

means of at least one conical screw (4) directed laterally
relative to the holder, which screw can engage a conical

hole (10) in the intermediate piece (6), said intermediate
piece (6) being provided with a screw connection (5)

oriented in the axis of rotation of the machine for the
fastening of a milling tool (14), 
characterized
 in that the
intermediate piece (6) separates the milling tool (14) from

the holder (2), that the intermediate piece (6) is elongated
and has a diameter at the end facing the milling tool (14)

that is the same as or less than the diameter of the milling
tool (14), whereas the end of the intermediate piece

(6) facing the milling tool (14) there are at least three
radially directed projections (7) wedge-shaped in the axial

direction which projections are symmetrically disposed
about the axis of rotation (9), and which can engage a

corresponding number of axially wedge-shaped keyways (8) in
the one end of the milling tool (14), and where the extreme

surfaces of the milling tool facing the intermediate piece
are in abutment with surfaces on the intermediate piece.
Tool system (1) according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that the angle between the surfaces which mutually form

the wedge shape on the projections on the intermediate
piece and in the keyways in the milling tool is in the

range of 2 - 10Â°.
Tool system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in
that the intermediate piece (6) is provided with four outwardly-extending

projections (7) disposed in a cruciform
manner, and that the milling tool (14) is provided with a 

number of cruciformly-disposed keyways (8) which corresponds
to the projections (7).
Tool system (1) according to any of the claims 1 - 3,

characterized
 in that the end of the intermediate piece (6)
facing the milling tool (14) is provided with swarf discharge

channels which are arranged symmetrically about the
axis of rotation (9).
Tool system (1) according to any of the claims 1 - 4,

characterized
 in that the screw connection (5) between the
intermediate piece (6) and the milling tool (14) comprises

a screw situated for engaging the milling tool (14), said
screw having a head configured as a bevel gear which is or

may be engaged with a second bevel gear disposed on a first
end of a journal which is rotatably mounted inside the

intermediate piece (6), and where the other end of the
journal is configured to be operated with a tightening

tool.
