<ABSTRACT>
A digital channel multiplexer, intended to be incorporated into a transmission network, comprises more than two access means (CAm) interconnected by a linking means (B) in order to multiplex and demultiplex the digital channels. It is characterised in that the linking means is a bus comprising a set (B2) of data transmission wires (Fm) to each of which are linked, as sender, a single access means (CAm) and, as receiver, all the other access means. The fault tolerance of this multiplexer is enhanced.
