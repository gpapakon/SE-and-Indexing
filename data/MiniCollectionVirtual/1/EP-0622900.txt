<ABSTRACT>
To solve inconvenience of a user in manipulating a key on a remote 
controller more than twice for operating two appliances like VCR and 

television, a data transmission method of a remote controller sets a 
specific key on the remote controller during manufacturing process 

thereof to supply a consecutive plurality of data upon manipulating the 
specific key, and supplies the data regardless of different data formats 

due to being included in different manufacturing companies, thereby 
allowing at least two operations only by user's key manipulation of the 

remote controller once, which is adoptable to appliances such as 
televisions, VCRs and audio systems which employ the remote controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission method for a remote
controller, and more particularly to a data transmission method for a remote
controller, wherein a key on a remote controller is pressed once to simultaneously
supply at least two data for a consecutive multistage operation to a predetermined
apparatus controllable by the remote controller.In electronic products or household electronic appliances a remote controller
is widely used for controlling the operation of a specific appliance over a long
distance. Such a remote controller transmits an operational signal either by radio
transmission or an infrared ray is utilized as a transmission signal.The remote controller is equipped with a plurality of keys for controlling
predetermined operations, and the user's manipulation of a key on the remote
controller supplies only one kind of data corresponding to the key pressed, thereby
initiating a specific function of one appliance. U.S. Patent No. 4,866,434 describes
the efficient storage of data in the memory of a remote control hand unit.In the current trend to functional
improvement of the remote controller, a plurality of appliances are controlled by a
single remote controller. A technique used in such a remote controller is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 5,128,667. It provides a remote controller which is capable of
controlling a plurality of appliances equipped as a set.Furthermore, EP-A-0 392 872 describes addressing of several
independent units by pointing the remote controller in the direction of the device,
which should be controlled.However, the conventional remote controller requires at least two key
manipulations to consecutively operate more than two appliances. More specifically,
when a video cassette recorder (VCR) and a television are equipped as one set, in
order to use the VCR, the user must turn on the power of the VCR, and then set the
channel of the television to three or four by means of a channel adjustment key or to
a video mode. Accordingly, the key of the remote controller is manipulated at least
twice such that the keys are pressed in the order of a power key and then channel
key 3, or the power key and then video/TV mode conversion key. Also, in a remote controller generally used with a VCR, which can operate a
television, the user turns on the power of the VCR to select the television function of
the remote controller and sets the channel number by means of the channel key.
Thus, the user manipulates the keys at least three times according to this order. As

<CLAIMS>
A data transmission method for a remote controller comprising a key matrix (20)
with a plurality of keys, an integrated circuit (10) and a transmission means (R1,

LED, Q) for transmitting a signal for controlling at least two different apparatuses
of distinct types equipped as a set, said method comprising the steps of:


presetting a key for indicating a plurality of data outputs to said integrated circuit of
said remote controller; and
consecutively producing said plurality of data comprising at least first and second
data intended for transmission by said transmission means respectively to a first

and second apparatus of said at least two different apparatuses of distinct types
equipped as a set when a user presses said key to allow said apparatuses to

successively carry out different operations in response to receipt of said plurality
of data.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said plurality of data have the same
format but a different number of bits, respectively.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said plurality of data have different
formats but the same number of bits, respectively.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said plurality of data have different
formats and different number of bits, respectively.
