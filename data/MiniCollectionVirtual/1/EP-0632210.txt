<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a toothed coupling which is suitable especially for a railway vehicle drive unit and which consists essentially of an internally toothed input-side (10) and output-side coupling part (20) and of an externally toothed connecting member (30) operatively connected to these parts. In order to achieve as large as possible a tooth centre distance where the installation space is restricted, the two coupling parts (10, 20) are, according to the invention, designed in such a way that they each have an annular space (15, 25) open on their mutually facing sides, into which the end regions of the hollow cylindrical connecting member (30) project, the latter then surrounding the hubs (11, 21) of the two coupling parts (10, 20) with a radial clearance (50). To facilitate installation and removal of the drive unit, the connecting member (30) is divided into two halves. With its coupling part (10, 20) and corresponding seals (18, 28, 46), each half (35, 36) encloses an oil space (47, 48) which is maintained during the installation and removal of the drive unit.

Gear coupling for connecting a driving shaft (2) with a driven shaft (7),
especially for a power unit of a rail-bound vehicle, with


a first internally geared coupling element (10), having a hub (11) for rotationally
fixed location on the driving shaft (2),
a second internally geared coupling element (20), having a hub (21) for
rotationally fixed location on the driven shaft (7), and
a hollow-cylindrical connecting element (30), having crowned external gearings
(33, 34) on both ends (31, 32), of which one (33) engages with the internal

gearing (14) of the first coupling element (10) and the other (34) with the
internal gearing (24) of the second coupling element (20),
characterized
 in that

the hub (11, 21) of each internally geared coupling element (10, 20) is connected via a
web (12, 22) with a ring (13, 23) having the internal gearing (34, 24), with a unilaterally

open ring space (15, 25) being formed;
the ends (31, 32) of the connecting element (30) extend into the ring space (15, 25), with
the connecting element (30) surrounding the hubs (11, 21) at a radial distance (50);
the connecting element (30) is separated into a first (35) and a second half (36) in a
plane (40) vertical to its rotation axis;
means are provided for force and/or friction-locking, rotationally fixed connection of the
two halves (35, 36);
and that the central bore of each half (35, 36) of the connecting element (30) near the
joint (40) is closed.
Gear coupling acc. to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
the rings (13, 23) having the internal gearing (14, 24) are each connected to a

corresponding web (12, 22) by means of inertia or electron beam welding. 
Gear coupling acc. to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the two
half sections (35, 36) are screwed to each other by means of face-to-face flanges (37,

38).
Gear coupling acc. to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that in addition to
the screws (39) radially aligned bolts (41) are provided, inserted without play in bores

(42), with their axes in the section joint (40).
Gear coupling acc. to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that in addition to
the screws (39) a Hirt gearing (43) is provided, integrated in the two flanges (37, 38).
Gear coupling acc. to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
 in that
on both rings (13, 23) having internal gearing (14,24), there is a supporting ring (16, 26)

on the side opposite each web (12, 22), essentially radially inwards arranged, and that
there is to be at least one pre-loaded spring (17, 27) between each support ring (16, 26)

and the neigh-boring end (31, 32) of the connecting element (30).
Gear coupling acc. to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
 in that
between each support ring (16, 26) and the neighboring end (31, 32) of the connecting

element (39) there is an elastic seal (18, 28).
Gear coupling acc. to at least one of the above claims, 
characterized

in that the profile of an engine and/or transmission-related labyrinth sealing (5) is
integrated in the external sides of the webs (12, 22) of the first (10) and/or the second

internally geared clutch element (20).
