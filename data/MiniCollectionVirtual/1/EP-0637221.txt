<ABSTRACT>
An arthroscopic indenter (10) for measuring creep deformation behavior, stress relaxation behavior and thickness of cartilage in vivo and in situ. A computer-based system (76) measures deformation or force information upon cartilage and processes that information for closed-loop control of an indenter tip (66) while also calculating intrinsic properties associated with the cartilage such as stiffness, compressibility and/or permeability.

 DESCRIPTIONARTHROSCOPIC INDENTER AND METHOD FOR USING THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an arthroscopic indenter in general and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for measuring internal properties of cartilage.2. Description of the Relevant ArtThe effects of articular cartilage degenerative diseases (such as osteoarthritis or 

 patella) are visible to the naked eye when â– '...he disease has reached an advanced stage. Manifestations of these diseases include changes in the tissue's: 1) bio echanical properties (stiffness, permeability, compressibility), 2) biochemical composition (type II collagen, proteoglycan macromolecules, interstitial water content) , and 3) morphological characteristics (surface fibrillation and fraying, osteophyte formation) . At the early stages of cartilage degeneration, the tissues's stiffness decreases and its compressibility and permeability increase. Thus, a reliable means to quantify the initial stages of cartilage degeneration is to obtain its mechanical (or material) properties. This can be accomplished during arthroscopy, which is an in vivo and in situ procedure, using a probe to examine qualitatively the articular surfaces. Using direct vision provided by an arthroscopic fiberoptic tube connected to a videocamera, the probe is used to palpate the tissue and, based on the tissue's indentation, the 

orthopaedist decides on the existence or severity of the disease. During this procedure, the orthopaedist also examines visually the surface characteristics of cartilage. This procedure is neither objective nor successful in determining the early stages of degenerative diseases, during which visual abnormalities are not present.A device used to measure the "deformation resistance" of tissue, and particularly the articular surface of the patella, is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,364,399. This arthroscopic instrument simply measures the amount of resistance pressure exerted by the cartilage at a given indentation. Positioning of the probe is manually accomplished, and perpendicularity of the probe relative to the cartilage surface is subjectively determined. The distance of indentation is mechanically calculated often using manual placement of the pressure transducer against the cartilage surface. Manual indentation process is not sufficiently accurate to allow repeatable, objective measurements. Manual indentation devices cannot programmably vary the applied indentations or forces in order to more
