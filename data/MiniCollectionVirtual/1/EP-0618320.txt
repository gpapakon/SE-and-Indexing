<ABSTRACT>
A lightweight warp knitted textile fabric suitable 
for use as the loop component of a hook-and-loop fastener is 

formed of a set of ground yarns (12) knitted in a relatively 
stretchable construction with a set of loop-forming yarns (14) 

formed in a stitch pattern producing elongated underlap 
loops extending outwardly from the technical back of the 

fabric which can be readily interengaged with the hook 
elements of a mating hook component without any necessity 

for brushing, napping or mechanically raising the loops. In 
one embodiment, a second set of loop-forming yarns (10) is formed 

in a stitch pattern producing elongated loops extending 
outwardly from the technical face of the fabric which can be 

adhered to a backing material such as a carpet backing. In 
another embodiment, filling yarn is inserted weftwise in 

every fabric course. The fabric is preferably finished with 
a starch application to improve handleability during 

subsequent processing and, in the case of the second 
embodiment, a fluorocarbon composition is applied when the 

fabric will be adhered to a foam carpet backing to restrict 
foam penetration into the fabric interstices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fabric
fasteners of the type commonly referred to as hook-and-loop
fasteners. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a novel warp-knitted loop-type textile fastener fabric
and a method of producing such a fastener fabric on a warp
knitting machine.So-called hook-and-loop fasteners have gained
considerable popularity over recent years. Such fasteners
basically include two generally flat components attachable
and detachable to and from face abutting relation with one
another. Typically, each fastener component is of a textile
fabric construction, the hook or "male" component having a
fabric ground layer with a plurality of relatively stiff
hook-shaped elements extending in upstanding relation from
one face of the ground layer and the loop or "female"
component similarly having a fabric ground layer with a
plurality of relatively flexible pile-type loops extending
outwardly from one face of the ground layer. In use, the
hook and loop faces of the fastener components grippingly
engage one another when pressed together in face abutting
relation by penetration of the hook-shaped elements of the
hook component into the loops at the opposing face of the
loop component. The engagement between the hook and loop
faces of the two components resists separation thereof until
a threshold force is exerted on one component in a peeling-like
fashion.Typically, both components of conventional hook-and-loop 
fasteners have been of relatively heavyweight
constructions. For example, many hook components utilize
hook elements formed of relatively heavy denier inflexible
synthetic monofilament yarns firmly secured in a similarly
stiff inflexible ground fabric, to withstand repeated
attachment and detachment to and from a mating loop
component without excessive breakage of the hook elements or
tearing of the ground fabric. Similarly, loop components
commonly have a relatively stiff inflexible ground layer
supporting elongated loops of multifilament synthetic yarns,
which normally are brushed or napped to produce a plush-like
loop surface wherein the individual filaments are mainly
separated from one another, in order to maximize the
available loops for engagement with the mating hook-like
elements of the other fastener component. Thus, although a
number of the individual filaments in the loops may be
broken each time the hook and loop components are attached
and then detached, the large number of available loops owing
to the use of napped or brushed multifilament yarns
