<ABSTRACT>
A process for recovering a concentrate of chromans from a distillate containing chromans is provided comprising the steps of: (1) forming chroman phosphates in the distillate; (2) subjecting the distillate to shearing forces, in the presence of a gas of flotation to form a froth; and (3) recovering the froth containing the concentrate of chroman phosphates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of recovering a concentrate of chromans from a mixture
containing chromans.The chromans are a commercially valuable group of chemicals that show biological
activity as vitamin E and antioxidant properties. In this specification and the claims, the
term "chromans" includes chroman and derivatives of chroman such as the hydroxy
chromans tocopherol and tocotrienol (commonly referred to as the "tocols"), the alpha,
beta gamma and delta forms corresponding to 3,2,1 and 0 methyl groups. They are often
used as dietary supplements. Chromans are second tier free radical scavengers in animals
and humans which work with vitamin C and ubiquinone to minimize oxygen damage to
cells.Chromans are present in many natural lipids. Chroman concentrates are prepared from the
"distillate" created while deodorising the lipids. Lipids are deodorised using a distillation
process designed to remove volatile products. The volatile products are principally free
fatty acids, but also include aldehydes from oxidation and many other substances. The
molten lipid is either purged with super heated steam injection or spread on a large surface
in a flowing steam flux. The volatiles (including the chromans) and the steam are then
condensed and the non-aqueous fraction recovered as the "distillate".Presently, the main source of vitamin E is RRR-α-tocopherol derived from soybean oil.
The raw oil is stripped with steam to strip the lower molecular weight free fatty acid
("FFA") from the oil which has a molecular weight three times that of the FFA. The
chromans have a similar molecular weight to the FFA and therefore follow the FFA into
the distillate. The distillate is then redistilled to give a higher concentration of chromans.
Typically, the chromans must then be methylated to give vitamin E.There are two main problems with the known process. First, if there is a low concentration
of chromans, the relative vapour pressure between the chromans and the FFA in the
distillate is insufficient to enable satisfactory concentration. Second, during the distillation
a high concentration of tocotrienols, phytol and farnesene form and these compounds have 
a low vitamin E activity. Further, the process based on a series of distillations is inefficient
and uses a lot of energy and capital plant.As a result, investigations were made into developing a process to concentrate chromans
which avoids the high temperature refining process.There is a well known art for concentrating hydrophobic molecules from high surface
tensio
