<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display cell comprising a pair of 
substrates, a liquid crystal material sandwiched between said 

pair of substrates, and an optical polarization memory film (5) 
provided on one or both of the substrates. The optical 

polarization memory film (5) is exposed by polarized lights (12) to 
produce a positive orientation means including multiple micro 

domains. In the micro domains, orientation direction is 
uniform in each domain and substantially isotropic as a whole. 

The visual angular dependency is eliminated. No rubbing 
treatment is done, and problems caused by rubbing can be 

solved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display cell and a manufacturing method thereof, and more
particularly to a liquid crystal display cell and a
manufacturing method thereof capable of improving the visual
angle.In a liquid crystal display cell or liquid crystal
cell utilized for a liquid crystal display, a particular
orientation state of liquid crystal molecules is changed to a
different state by some external action as electric field. The
change in the optical property caused by the change of
orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is utilized as a
visual change in a display. Usually, for orientating liquid
crystal molecules in a particular state, the surface of the
glass substrates which sandwich a liquid crystal layer are
subjected to orientation treatment.In a conventional liquid crystal cell of twisted
nematic (TN) type, the orientation treatment is achieved by
rubbing a pair of glass substrates (having electrodes, an
orientation layer, and the like on its surface,) which sandwich 
a liquid crystal layer with a cotton cloth or the like in one
direction, i.e. a so-called rubbing treatment.When rubbing treatment is done to substrates, the
direction of rubbing is arranged in such a way that the rubbing
directions of the upper and lower substrates are orthogonal to
each other. When the liquid crystal cell is of negative
display type, parallel polarizers are disposed in such a way
that one of the rubbing directions is parallel to the
polarization axis of a neighboring polarizer. In the case of
positive display, crossed polarizers are disposed in such a way
that polarization axes are parallel to the rubbing directions
of neighboring substrates.When orientation treatment is done by rubbing as
described above, orientated direction of the liquid crystal
molecules become uniform on the substrate surface. Thus, when
the display is viewed by an observer, there occurs a visual
angle dependency of display, that the display can easily be
observed only from a certain limited range of observation.
Reference can be made on the visual angle dependency of display
to the European patent applications No. 9311415⊘.1 filed on
September 4, 1993, No. 941⊘2⊘⊘4.2 filed on February 9, 1994,
and No. 941⊘2⊘⊘5.9 filed on February 9, 1994.Further, rubbing may generate electrostatic charge,
which may cause dielectric breakdown of the orientation film,
or insufficient orientation of liquid crystal molecules
thereat, and hence, a display defect. In a liquid crystal cell 
employing active (drive) matrix,
