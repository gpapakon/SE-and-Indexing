<ABSTRACT>
A novel chewing gum and confection composition is disclosed which is pourable and includes between about 30 and about 90 percent particles of chewing gum having an average particle size of between about 0.5 and 6 mm. The pourable composition also includes between about 10 and about 70 percent dry, free-flowing, sweet confection. Preferably, the chewing gum particles are bits of bubble gum and the sweet confection is powdered dextrose. A novel method of making this pourable composition is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field
of chewing gum, such as bubble gum, and confections.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
combination and format for chewing gum and a dry, free
flowing sweet confection.It is generally known that novel forms of
chewing gum and confections are popular with
consumers. Over the years, several novel chewing gum
and/or confection productions have been introduced.
These novel products have utilized various
combinations of flavours, types, shapes, texture and
or packaging to interest the consumer. One such
product, sold under the name "DORKS", is described as
bubble gum in particulate form packaged in and poured
from a box.Other novel products have combined chewing
gum and a confection material. For example, the
product described in U.S. Patent No. 4,902,519 is
commercially available under the name "Thumb Suckers".
This product includes a hard candy sucker in an
elastic mold with a bubble gum seal at the bottom of
the mold. Another example is a product known as "Blow
Pops" which include a mass of chewing gum surrounded
by a hard candy sucker. Still another example is a
product known as "Tidal Wave" which is a cube of
chewing gum with a hollow centre filled with a liquid
confection. Yet another example is a chewing gum
product known as "Cinnaburst" which includes small
bits of hard candy dispersed within a mass of chewing
gum.Another prior art composition is French
Patent 238611 which discloses a carbonated candy glass
which when placed in the mouth produces a short lived
popping sensation, mixed with a bubble gum. The
components are from 1.68 mm to 4.76 mm in size. Briefly stated the composition aspect of the present invention is a
pourable chewing gum and confection composition which includes particles of
chewing gum and a dry, free-flowing crystalline or powdered sweetener and a method of making
such a pourable chewing gum and confection composition.In accordance with the composition aspect of the invention, the
particles of chewing gum have an average particle size of from 0.5 to 6
mm. These particles of chewing gum comprise from 30 to 90 percent
of the composition. The composition also includes from 10 to 70
percent dry, free-flowing, sweetener, such as powdered dextrose.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the composition, the
particles of chewing gum have an average particle size of about 3.2 mm and are
present at about 60 percent. Also, in this preferred embodiment, the sweetener
is powdered dextrose with a flavoring agent added. This

<CLAIMS>
A pourable chewing gum and confection
composition comprising:


from 30 to 90 percent particles of chewing
gum product having an average particle size of from

crystalline or powdered sweetener selected from the

group consisting of dextrose, sucrose, corn syrups,
high potency sweetener and combinations thereof, in

addition to the particles of chewing gum product.
A composition as claimed in Claim 1 wherein
the high potency sweetener is selected from the group

consisting of aspartame, acesulfame K, sodium
saccharine, sucralose, as well as combinations

thereof.
A composition as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim
2 wherein the high potency sweetener is treated for

delayed release by encapsulation, agglomeration, or
spray drying.
A composition as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 3 wherein the free flowing sweetener

further comprises a flavouring agent, a colouring
agent or a combination of both.
A composition as claimed in Claim 4 wherein
the flavouring agent is selected to compliment a

flavouring agent in the chewing gum.
A composition as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim
5 wherein the colouring agent is selected so as to 

match the colour of the chewing gum particles.
