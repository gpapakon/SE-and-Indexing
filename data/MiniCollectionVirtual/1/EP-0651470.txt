<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a card edge connector (10) with a 
housing (12) and electrical contacts (14). The electrical 

contacts (14) are spaced from adjacent contacts (14) at a 
center-to-center pitch of 0.64 mm (0.025 inch). The contacts 

(14) each have a middle section (34) that is interference-fit 
in a contact receiving channel (18) of the housing (12). The 

middle sections (34) each have a general ring shape with a 
center electromagnetic reduction aperture. The ring shape 

forms a structural truss to retain structural rigidity of the 
middle section (34) to enable the interference fit to be made 

and, the center electromagnetic reduction aperture reduces 
capacitance between the closely spaced adjacent contacts 

(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a card edge connector as
defined in the preamble portion of patent claim 1. Such a
card edge connector is known from EP-356 156 A2.The art is replete with patents regarding card edge connectors.
Examples can be found in the following U.S. Patents:
4,891,023; 4,894,022; 5,026,292; 4,030,792; and
4,846,734. There is a seemingly ever-present need for reducing
the size of card edge connectors to minimize the
amount of space used by such connectors on mother printed
circuit boards. Present card edge connectors only space
contacts at a center-to-center pitch or spacing of about
0.050 inch because of electromagnetic problems and manufacturability
problems that arise if the present types of
contacts are attempted to be moved closer together.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a card edge connector with a reduced amount of
space used on mother printed circuit boards.EP-356 156 A2 discloses a card edge connector comprising
a housing having a card edge receiving area and two rows
of contact receiving channels on opposite sides of the
card edge receiving area and electrical contacts connected 
to the housing in the contact receiving channels,
each contact having a top spring arm, a bottom solder
tail, and a middle section therebetween. The location of
the pilot hole in this card edge connector does not allow
to reduce the space needed on a mother board.According to the present invention this object is accomplished
with a card edge connector as claimed in claim 1.Dependent claims are directed on features of preferred
embodiments of the invention.The foregoing aspects and other features of the invention
are explained in the following description, taken in
connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:
Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a card edge connector
incorporating features of the present invention;Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of an alternate embodiment
of a card edge connector incorporating features of the 
present invention;Fig. 3 is a top plan view of one end of the housing of the
connector shown in Fig. 1; andFig. 4 is a partial plan top view of a mother printed
circuit board adapted to have the connector shown in Fig.
1 connected thereto.  Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a cross sectional view
of a card edge connector 10 incorporating features of the
present invention. Although the present invention will be
described with reference to the embodiments shown in the
drawings, it should be understood that the present
invention can be
