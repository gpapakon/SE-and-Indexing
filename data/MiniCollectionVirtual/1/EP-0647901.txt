<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to networked computer systems, and particularly to 
temporary restriction of access to such systems. A computer system (2) 

connectable over a network to a plurality of users comprises normal 
access control means for restricting user access to the system (2), the 

control means comprising a user authentication procedure (44, 46) in 
which at logon the user's identity is compared with a first definition of 

authorised users; system-wide profile means referenced (72) by all users 
of the system (2) at logon; and temporary access control facilitation 

means for temporarily preventing access to the system (2) by a normally 
authorised user or users. The facilitation means allow a privileged user 

of the system (2) to create a second definition of temporarily 
unauthorised users, which is referenced by the system-wide profile means 

at logon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to networked computer systems, and 
particularly to temporary restriction of access to such systems. In a computer network, a single system may provide resources to a 
plurality of users connected to the system over a network. On occasions 
the system may become so overloaded that a particular user or users 
cannot operate effectively, and it may be necessary to restrict access to 
the system resources by some or all users for a period of time. In most multiuser systems, a file or files listing valid usernames, 
or valid combinations of usernames and passwords is kept, and a user 
gains access to the system by supplying such a name and password when he 
logs on. One simple prior art method of temporarily preventing a user from 
accessing system resources is to log the user off (if necessary) and 
reset his logon password, preventing him from regaining access. However, 
this is generally undesirable for reasons of administration and security. 
Many systems would not allow the user's original password to be reissued, 
so that the user would have to be notified of the new password to regain 
access. Another prior art method of preventing a user from logging on is to 
remove his username from the file listing authorised users. (This is 
similar to the standard method of deleting a user permanently from a 
system, in which in addition a user's data files, if any, would be 
deleted to release system resources). Normal access would be restored by 
reinstating the user's name in the list of authorised users. A 
disadvantage of this method is the possibility of data loss, especially 
if the file containing usernames contains other critical data which is 
also erased. To facilitate reinstating access in the above method, the file 
listing authorised users could be backed up (i.e. copied to a secure 
location) prior to deleting any users' entries in the active copy checked 
at logon. To restore the system to its original state, the backed-up file 
would be copied back to its original location. However, if the original 
copy were lost, it might be difficult to reinstate access. It is clearly  
 
preferable not to have to alter the files containing usernames or 
passwords. For example, in IBM's AIX operating system, which is a type of UNIX 
operating system, a file called "/etc/passwd" contains the listing of 
usernames, and references to a further file containing encrypted 
passwords. Loss of this file prevents ANY further logon to the system; 
recovery entails a reinstallation of the

<CLAIMS>
A computer system (2) connectable over a network to a plurality of 
users, the system (2) comprising: 

   normal access control means for restricting user access to the 
system (2), the control means comprising a user authentication procedure 

(44, 46) in which at logon the user's identity is compared with a first 
definition of authorised users; 

   system-wide profile means referenced (72) by all users of the 
system (2) at logon; and 

   temporary access control facilitation means for temporarily 
preventing access to the system (2) by a normally authorised user or 

users, the facilitation means allowing a privileged user of the system 
(2) to create a second definition of temporarily unauthorised users, 

which second definition is referenced by the system-wide profile means at 
logon. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the facilitation means is 
adapted to modify (90) the system-wide profile to cause it to reference 

the second definition of temporarily unauthorised users. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the facilitation 
means causes the system-wide profile to provide information regarding the 

temporary access restriction to a user temporarily denied access. 
A system as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
facilitation means includes means for logging off (91) users already 

logged on to the system (2) who are temporarily unauthorised according to 
the second definition. 
A system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the facilitation means is 
adapted to define a grace period and to issue (87) a warning to users 

already logged on to the system (2) that system access will be restricted 
on expiry of the grace period. 
A system as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
facilitation means is operable to automatically reinstate (94) access to 

some or all temporarily unauthorised users at a specified time. 
A system as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which 
the system is a UNIX system. 
A method of temporarily preventing access to a system (2) 
connectable over a network to a plurality of users and having normal 

access control means for restricting user access to the system (2) 
comprising a user authentication procedure (44, 46) in which at logon the 

user's identity is compared to a first definition of authorised users and 
further having system-wide profile means referenced (72) by all users of 

the system (2) at logon, the method comprising the steps of: 
   referencing a second definition of temporarily unauthorised users 

from the system-wide profile means; and 
   denying access to a user who is temporarily unauthorised according 

to the second definition.
