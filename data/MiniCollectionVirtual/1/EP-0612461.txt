Equalization method for amplification of audio 
frequency signals characterized in that it provides first 

means for correcting the response curve for stable 
conditions and at least one second correction means whose 

gain (GT) is different from the gain (GS) of the first 
correction means for correcting the response curve under 

transient conditions, discriminates transients, switches 
from the first correction means to the second correction 

means when a transient is discriminated and switches in 
the opposite direction after the transient. 
Equalization method according to claim 1 
characterized in that detection, discrimination and 

switching in the presence of a transient are effected 
within a total time of less than 5 ms. 
Equalization method according to claim 1 or 
claim 2 characterized in that switching from the second 

correction means to the first correction means is 
effected after a time-delay relative to the transient of 

between 30 ms and 100 ms. 
Equalization method according to claim 1 or 
claim 2 characterized in that switching from the second 

correction means to the first correction means is 
effected progressively as soon as the signal stops rising 

and in a time between 30 ms and 100 ms. 
Equalization method according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterized in that switching between 

the first and second correction means is effected at a 
zero-crossing of the signal. 
Equalizer device for audio frequency amplifiers 
comprising first correction means for stable conditions 

characterized in that it further comprises at least one 

second correction means for transient conditions whose 
gain (GT) is different from the gain (GS) of the first  

 
correction means, a peak detector (O3), transient 

discriminator means (O4) connected to the peak detector, 
and means for switching from the first correction means 

to the second correction means and vice versa, the 
switching means being controlled by the discriminator 

means. 
Equalizer device according to claim 6 
characterized in that the first and second correction 

means are constituted by a single circuit whose gain can 
be set to either of two values by simple switching of a 

resistor (R10). 
Equalizer device according to claim 7 
characterized in that switching of the resistor (R10) is 

effected by means of a transistor (T1) controlled by the 
discriminator means (O4). 
Equalizer device according to any one of claims 
6 to 8 characterized in that it comprises a zero-crossing 

detector associated with the discriminator (O4) in order 
to effect the switching on a zero-crossing of the signal. 
Equalizer device according to any one of 
claims 6 to 9 characterized in that it comprises variable 

time-delay means governing return from the second 
correction means to the first correction means after the 

transient.
