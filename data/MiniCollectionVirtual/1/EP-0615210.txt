<CLAIMS>
A chip card comprising at least one output/input interface, a processor and
a memory for use in a telecommunications terminal connected to a

telecommunications network, wherein user-related data can be stored on the chip
card, characterised in that


the chip card comprises first means for receiving signalling- and useful
data from the telecommunications network, second means for processing

telecommunications protocols and at least one signalling-protocol, and
third means for processing the received signalling- and useful data,
received and processed signalling- and useful data can be stored in the
memory,
by insertion into the telecommunications terminal the chip card can be
directly connected to the telecommunications network by the first means

and
signalling via the first signalling-protocol is effected by the second means
of the chip card in order to facilitate a direct exchange of data between the

telecommunications network and the chip card.
A chip card according to Claim 1 for use with at least one further chip card
and comprising fourth means for checking whether the at least one chip card is

inserted in the telecommunications terminal.
Use of the chip card according to Claim 1 or 2 for the processing of GSM
protocols and/or ISDN protocols.
Use of the chip card according to one of Claims 1 or 2 for handling
telecommunications services.
Use of the chip card according to Claim 1 or 2 for the storage of user
facilities and/or macro-commands. 
Use of the chip card according to Claim 1 or 2 for exchanging signalling-
and useful data between the chip card and a telecommunications network.
Use of the chip card according to Claim 2 for exchanging signalling- and
useful data between at least two identical chip cards or at least two different chip

cards in one telecommunications terminal and/or in different telecommunications
terminals.
