<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the C-alkylation of an acyclic or cyclic ketone compound having at least one hydrogen atom or one ester functional group in the position alpha  with respect to the carbonyl group. The feature of the process of the invention consists in carrying out the alkylation reaction of the said compound, in the position  alpha with respect to the carbonyl group, in the presence of an effective amount of a catalyst comprising a condensed or noncondensed orthophosphate anion. In its preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a process for the C-alkylation of cyclopentanone, of 2-methylcyclopentanone and of substituted cyclopentanones.
