<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing multilayer mirrors for use in conjunction with 
X-rays. Customary multilayer mirrors are composed of discrete, thin layers which 

generally consist of alternating absorption and spacer layers. In order to counteract 
surface roughness of the thin layers, it is known to smoothen the layers by ion etching 

after deposition. A drawback thereof consists in that the material of one layer penetrates 
into the other layer, so that the location of the interface and the thickness of the layers 

of the multilayer mirror are no longer suitably defined. In accordance with the 
invention, a multilayer mirror is manufactured by stimulating the penetration of one of 

the materials into the layer with the other material, after which the original layer 
thickness of the first material is removed by etching. By repeating th
is process one layer 
after the other, a multilayer mirror is obtained which does not consist of an alternation 

of uniform, discrete layers of a different material but of recurrent layers of one of the 
materials in which the other material has penetrated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing multilayer mirrors, in 
which a first layer of a first material and of a first thickness is deposited on a substrate, 
a second layer of a second material and of a second thickness being deposited on the 
first layer, and material being removed from the second layer by ion-etching 
the 
material by ion bombardment, the foregoing steps being repeated at least once. The invention also relates to a multilayer mirror manufactured by means 
of the method of the invention. A method of this kind is disclosed in an article "Ion etching of thin W-layers: 
enhanced reflectivity of W-C multilayer coatings", Applied Surface Science 47 
(1991), (Elsevier Science Publishers, North-Holland), pp. 63 to 76. The term "multilayer mirror" is to be understood to mean not only a 
multilayer mirror which is used in the visible part of the spectrum of electromagnetic 
radiation, but also in other (notably shortwave) parts thereof, or for reflection of 
elementary particles such as neutrons. Known multilayer mirrors are manufactured by providing materials with 
two different refractive indices on one another by physical deposition. The reflectivity 
of one interface layer for electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range smaller than, 
for example 50 nm amounts to some tenths of a percent for angles larger than the 
critical angle. Reflection of electromagnetic radiation on a multilayer mirror is based on 
interference of radiation reflected on the many interfaces of the multilayer mirror and is 
suitably approximated by the known Bragg relation. Therefore, this reflection is of a 
dispersive nature. For reflection angles larger than the critical angle, reflection 
amounting to some tens of percents can thus be obtained. Multilayer mirrors are thus 
used for high reflectivity at large angles relative to the surface of the layers and can 
also be used as dispersive elements because of their dispersive nature. A multilayer 
mirror for the reflection of shortwave radiation consists of periods of each time two 
materials of a different refractive index and of a thickness of the order of magnitude of  
 
the wavelength of the reflected radiation. For shortwave radiation a difference in 
refractive index can be considered as a difference in density, i.e. the atomic number. The total reflectivity of a multilayer mirror is determined by the 
magnitude of the reflection per interface, i.e. by the difference in refractive index. A 
large difference in refractive index implies that one
