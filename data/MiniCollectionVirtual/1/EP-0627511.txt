vertically movable grating (14) over a distance, which
is different from the length (L).

second vertically movable grating (14) is rotatably

connected to the lever (15) by a bar (21).
Loom according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that
a knife (12) of the selecting element is rotatably

connected to a bar (18), which is rotatably connected
to the lever (15), for each of the pile threads to be

bound into the second part of the upper piece and the
lower piece (100, 200) or a part carrying the knife

(12).
Loom according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that
the ratio between the distance (v) between the shaft

(22) or the centre of rotation of the lever (15) and
