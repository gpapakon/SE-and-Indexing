<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a method for treating a textile fabric web, in which a predetermined length of the fabric web is arranged within a treatment appliance, an endless fabric-web loop is made from the fabric web and the fabric-web loop is subsequently transported within the treatment appliance. At the same time, during its transport, the fabric-web loop is subjected to a mechanical and/or thermal treatment, such that, in particular, the volume, handle, surface pattern or water content of the fabric-web loop is thereby varied in a controlled manner, a higher or lower pressure than the particular ambient pressure being set in the treatment appliance. An apparatus for carrying out the method has a treatment appliance which is designed as a pressure-tight autoclave closed on all sides. The autoclave is provided with a loading orifice closeable in a gas-tight manner and with an internal transport appliance, the treatment appliance being assigned an overpressure or underpressure source.
