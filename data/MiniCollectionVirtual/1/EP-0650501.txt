<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to molded polyurethane foams prepared by reacting a specific polyisocyanate with a specific polyol in the presence of water as a blowing agent and a catalyst, wherein (a) the polyisocyanate comprises a mixture of (i) a specified amount of polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate and (ii) an NCO-terminated prepolymer prepared from the reaction of an organic polyisocyanate with a specified amount of poly(oxytetramethylene)glycol, or a specific NCO-terminated prepolymer prepared from the reaction of (i) an organic polyisocyanate, (ii) a specified amount of polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate and (iii) a specified amount of poly(oxytetramethylene)glycol, (b) the polyol contains a specified amont of polymer polyol prepared from the reaction of a polyetherpolyol with an ethylenic unsaturated monomer, and (c) the catalyst contains an organotin compound. The molded polyurethane foams can be prepared under good demoldability and have excellent abrasion resistance, and therefore, can be useful for automotive steering wheels, headrests, armrests and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MOLDED POLYURETHANE FOAMSBACKGROUND OF THE TNVENTTONThe present invention relates to molded polyurethane foams having excellent abrasion resistance useful for automotive material for steering wheels, headrests and armrests, material for furniture and the like.Integral skin polyurethane foams having fine skin are well-known to the public and are widely utilized as automotive material for steering wheels, headrests and armrests, and material for furniture and the like in various fields. The formation of the skin layer in the integral skin foams is based on the function of a blowing agent such as chlorofluorocarbon ("CFC") in the exothermic reaction of a polyisocyanate with a polyol. The use of a physical blowing agent such as CFC provides to the foams excellent skin properties which are required to the stated products. On the contrary, the use of a chemical blowing agent such as water does not usually provide any excellent skin properties to the foams.Some approaches to provide excellent skin properties to molded polyurethane foams have included, for example, those described in Japanese Kokai Patent No. H03-24108, in which a specific catalyst mixture comprising a urethane catalyst and a carbodiimide catalyst is employed to provide low core density in the presence of a non-reactive physical blowing agent, and Japanese Kokai Patent No. H03-33120, in which a specific catalyst mixture is employed in the presence of water as the primary blowing agent. Especially, the technology disclosed in the latter patent may be useful as an alternative technology of a CFC based blowing agent under the Freon Regulation.Since several years ago, it has been pointing out that CFC destroys the ozone layer of the Earth, and consequently, the use of CFC is globally expected to be restricted or abolished in various industrial fields in present and future. In such situation, some approaches to employ water as the primary blowing agent have been trying. However, in such prior arts, there is a technical problem that demolding time of the process employing water as a sole blowing agent is longer than the one of the process employing CFC as a blowing agent, and also that the former foams are not better in skin properties and abrasion resistance than the latter foams prepared by employing CFC.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

 The inventors researched to overcome the stated prior technical problems. That is, the purpose of the present invention is to provide molded polyurethane foams having excellent abrasion resistance under shorter
