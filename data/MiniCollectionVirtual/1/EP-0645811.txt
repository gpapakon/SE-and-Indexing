<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor chip (11) is mounted on a chip-mounting 
section (12). A conduction path forming section 

(20) having a plurality of conduction paths (24) 
formed therein is placed around the chip-mounting section 

(12). A heat sinking board (14) is bonded to the 
backsides of the chip-mounting section (12) and the conduction 

path forming section (20). In the conduction 
path forming section (20), a second insulating layer 

(22) is formed with notches (25), whereby the exposed 
area of conduction paths (24) that are wire-bonded to 

the chip-mounting section (12) is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device
and more particularly to a semiconductor device according to
the preamble of claim 1. Such a device is known from 39th
IEEE/ECC, May 23-24, 1989 Houston, Texas, US, D. Quint et
al.: "Electrical Design Methodology of A 407 Pin Multi Layer
Ceramic Package". This document discloses a semiconductor
chip IC having a plurality of pad electrodes on its top, a
conduction path forming section disposed around said
semiconductor chip, said conduction path forming section
including a plurality of insulating layers (PWR1 plane, PWR2
plane, GND, signal ...) said plurality of insulating layers
being located one over another and having their respective
openings, whereby the openings of the lower three insulating
layers are having the same diameter and beginning from the
top level of the IC, the openings increase in diameter in
irregular steps, said semiconductor chip IC being placed in
the opening of the lower three insulating layers, a plurality
of external terminals arranged on the uppermost one of the
plurality of insulating layers, a first group of conduction
paths formed on an insulating layer and having their one ends
exposed in an opening of the insulating layer above and their
other ends connected to said external terminals, a second 
group of conduction paths formed on another insulating layer
above the insulating layers with the first group of
conduction paths and having their one ends exposed in the
opening of the next insulating layer and their other ends
connected to said external terminals, bonding wires for
electrically connecting said one ends of said second group of
conduction paths with said pad electrodes of said
semiconductor chip IC, and a heat slug.As a form of package used for semiconductor integrated
circuits there is a PGA (pin grid array). The
PGA is arranged such that external terminals or pins are
fixed to a package body at regular intervals vertically
and in the form of grid. The PGA is often used as a
multi-terminal package.Semiconductor devices used in high frequency bands
each have an electrode formed on the entire backside of
their respective semiconductor chip in order to stabiize
their operating characteristics. Hereinafter, such
an electrode is referred to as a backside electrode.FIG. 6 shows a conventional semiconductor device
having a PGA structure. In FIG. 6, the semiconductor
device comprises a semiconductor chip 101, a chip-mounting
section 102, a conducting path forming section
110, a plurality of bonding wires 103, a heat
