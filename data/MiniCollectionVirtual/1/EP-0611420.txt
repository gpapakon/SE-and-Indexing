<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetically releasable spring pressure brake has a stationary coil-bearing housing (1) with a ring-shaped magnet coil (2) and a friction lining rotor (5) that cooperates with a non-revolving, but axially movable armature core disk (4) in order to press the friction lining against a shaft housing or end shield when no current is flowing through the magnet coil, the coil-bearing housing (1) being secured to the shaft housing or end shield. The spring pressure brake also has an electric driving circuit (10) for the magnet coil (2) for driving the same when the brake is released with a considerably increased power in comparaison with the power required to normally hold the brake in the released position. In order to obtain a brake having a simple design, a reduced heat load, short operating and releasing times and no air gap adjustment, the driving circuit (10) has a phase control (32) and means (20) for generating an overexcitation delay. In order to release the brake, the overexcitation delay generator drives the phase control (32) driving circuit (22) so that the firing angle is generated only after a predetermined overexcitation time has elapsed during which the magnet coil is excited by an overexcitation voltage, and afterwards the phase control (32) reduces the power applied to the magnet coil (2) by phase controlling.

Electromagnetically liftable spring-loaded brake 

having a fixed field spool housing (1) disposed 
concentrically to the shaft to be braked with an 

annular magnetic coil (2) therein, also disposed 
concentrically to the shaft, 
having a friction lining rotor (5) connected 
non-rotatably but axially slidably to the shaft to be 

braked via a hub (7), 
having a radially extending armature disc (4) disposed 
non-rotatably but axially slidably axially between the 

friction lining rotor (5) and the field spool housing 
(1), 
having pressure springs (3) disposed in the field spool 
housing (1), which act axially upon the armature disc 

(4) against the force of the magnetic coil (2) in the 
direction of the friction lining rotor in order, when 

the magnetic coil is currentless, to press the friction 
lining for braking against a shaft housing or end 

shield to which the field spool housing (1) is fixed, 
and having an electric control circuit (10) for the 
magnetic coil (2) for actuating same when the brake is 

lifted with a power which is much greater than when the 
brake is held in the released position, 
 
characterised in that the control circuit (10) has phase 

control (32) and a device (20) for generating an 
overexcitation time which, for lifting the brake, actuates a 

circuit which actuates the phase control (32) in order to 
generate the ignition angle only when a specified 

overexcitation time has elapsed, during which the magnetic 
coil is excited with an overexcitation voltage, and in that 

at the end of the overexcitation time the phase control (32) 
effects a reduction in the level of power at the magnetic 

coil (2).  
 
Spring-loaded brake according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the overexcitation time is 100 - 300 msec. 
Spring-loaded brake according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the phase control (32) has a partially 

controlled bridge rectifier (28 to 31). 
Spring-loaded brake according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that when a predetermined magnetic coil (2) 

is used, the phase control (32) is adapted to the respective 
mains voltage. 
Spring-loaded brake according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that when a predetermined phase control 

(32) is used, the magnetic coil (2) is adapted to the 
respective mains voltage. 
Spring-loaded brake according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that the current supply to the magnetic 
coil (2) passes through the end shield to which the 

spring-loaded brake is flanged.
