<ABSTRACT>
An electron beam apparatus focusses an electron 
beam (1) onto a specimen (6) by means of an objective 

magnetic lens (2). In order to detect changes in the 
height of the specimen, a laser light beam (1) from a 

laser source (9) is incident on the specimen (6) and 
the reflected laser beam (11) is detected by a lig
ht 
detector (3). Any change in the height of the 

specimen (6) changes the path of the laser beam (11) 
to the detector (3). Therefore, by monitoring the 

detector (3), the focussing of the electron beam (1) 
on the specimen (6) can be controlled by varying the 

current to an excitation coil (31) of the objective 
magnetic lens (2) or by moving the specimen (6) via a 

mounting stage (10). At least one of the pole pieces 
(28,29) of the objective lens (2) is on the opposite 

side of the path of the laser beam to the source of 
the electron beam (1), so that the objective magnetic 

lens (2) may be close to the specimen (6), permitting 
a short focal length. Thus, the laser beam (11) may 

pass between the pole pieces (28,29). An optical 
microscope (39) may also be provided to permit the 

specimen (6) to be viewed. The viewing path of the 
optical microscope (39) extends through an opening 

(37A) in one or both of the pole pieces (28,29) of the 
objective magnetic lens (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron beam 
apparatus, such as an electron microscope. When an electron microscope is used to 
investigate a specimen, such as a semiconductor wafer, 
an electron beam from an electron source is focussed 
onto the specimen by an objective magnetic lens. When 
an area of the sample is to be investigated, the 
electron beam is caused to scan the specimen, either 
by causing the point of incidence of the electron beam 
on the specimen to change by control of scanning means 
controlling the path of the electron beam, or by 
moving the specimen by moving a mounting stage on 
which the specimen is mounted. Such scanning occurs 
in electron beam lithography, and also in critical-dimension 
measurements, carried out on semiconductor 
wafers. However, in such electron beam apparatus, the 
surface of the sample may not be wholly even, and this 
is a particular problem with large silicon wafers 
having diameters of the order of 20 cm. Thus, the 
height of the surface of the wafer relatively to the 
objective magnetic lens may change, and this may 
result in the electron beam becoming out of focus.  
 For this reason, it has been proposed that means 
are provided for detecting the change in the wafer 
height. The focus of the electron beam may then be 
varied, by controlling the objective lens and/or by 
moving the mounting stage to move the wafer. JP-A-63-254649 disclosed such a height measuring 
means, in which light from a laser was directed onto 
the specimen at a position corresponding substantially 
to the point of incidence of the electron beam, and 
reflection of that light from the specimen was 
detected by a light detector. If the height of the 
specimen changed, there would be a change in the point 
of incidence of light beam on the specimen, and this 
could be detected by movement of the reflected light 
beam at the detector. Hence, by controlling the 
focussing of the electron beam and/or position of the 
wafer using the information from such a light 
detector, it was possible to maintain the electron 
beam in focus. Developments in semiconductor technology have 
permitted finer structures to be formed on 
semiconductor wafers. However, this then requires the 
focal length of the objective magnetic lens of an 
electron beam system to be reduced, bringing the 
objective lens closer to the specimen. In JP-A-63-254649, 
the laser beam passes between the objective 
lens and the specimen, but this becomes more difficult  
 
as the objective lens approaches the
