<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin
composition suitable for the manufacture of household
electrical appliance components, particularly three-dimensional
components such as housings and cases, and
provides for permanent antistatic and high water
resistance, abrasion resistance and other physical
properties.Thermoplastic resins are in broad use as packaging
materials and molding materials for the production of
lighting devices, household electrical appliance parts,
instrument covers and so on. However, shaped articles
molded from thermoplastic resins such as (meth)acrylate
resins, polystyrenic resins, polyolefins, etc. are
generally high in electric resistance and have the
serious drawback that they are easily charged on
friction to attract dust.Therefore, the following technologies have recently
been developed for imparting antistatic properties
to these thermoplastic resins.
(1) Coating the resin surface with an antistatic 
composition and drying;(2) Compounding an internal additive-type
antistatic agent into the resin;(3) Coating the resin surface with a silicone
compound;(4) Modifying the resin itself.Referring to the above technology (1) wherein a
surfactant solution is used as the antistatic agent,
the antistatic agent is easily dislodged from the resin
surface on repeated cleaning or friction, thus failing
to insure a permanent antistatic effect.In accordance with technology (2), glycerol fatty
acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, alkyldiethanolamines,
sodium salts of alkylbenzenesulfonates, quaternary
salts of alkylimidazoles, etc. are generally used
as internal additive-type antistatic agents. The
rationale is that even if the antistatic agent on the
resin surface is removed on repeated cleaning, the
internal additive-type antistatic agent in the depth of
the resin bleeds out onto the resin surface so that a
comparatively long-lasting antistatic effect can be
expected.However, it takes a fairly long time for restoration
of the antistatic performance and when an excess
of the internal antistatic agent bleeds out, the resin 
surface becomes sticky to attract dust more easily.
Moreover, as the surface becomes tacky or "dusted" with
the precipitated antistatic agent, the printability and
appearance of the resin surface are adversely affected.Furthermore, since these antistatic agents are low
molecular weight compounds, they are vaporized by the
heat of molding at high temperature. This means not
only an economic disadvantage, for the antistatic agent
must be used in more than the
