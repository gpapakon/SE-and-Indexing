<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic silver halide developer 
compositions and to a process for forming a black-and-white high contrast 
negative photographic silver image by development of a silver halide photographic 
element with an aqueous alkaline photographic developer composition. In general, the processing of black-and-white silver halide photographic 
materials is performed in the order of development, stopping, fixing and washing. Development is ordinarily carried out with aqueous alkaline developer 
compositions containing a developing agent, usually of the dihydroxybenzene type 
such as hydroquinone. The activity of these developing agents is greatly influenced 
by the pH of the solution and the optimum pH range should not significantly 
change during the useful life of the developer composition; therefore the composition 
possesses a high buffering capacity. The developer compositions are usually 
provided with antifogging agents (in particular inorganic antifogging agents such 
as soluble bromides and organic antifogging agents) to retard the development of 
non-exposed silver halide grains and decrease fog, i.e. silver formed as a result of 
the development of said grains. Antioxidant compounds are usually added to the alkaline developer 
composition to limit oxidation of the developing agents by air. Alkaline and ammonium 
sulfites are the most common compounds used for this purpose, but other 
antioxidant compounds such as hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid can be used instead 
of or in combination with such sulfites. In graphic arts, there are two different conventional processing systems 
well known in the art. The "rapid access" and the "lith" processing system, able 
respectively to treat a "rapid access" film and a "lith" film. The "rapid access" 
processing system is characterised by the combination of a hydroquinone 
developer and an auxiliary developing agent, such as 3-pyrazolidone compounds 
or amino-phenol compounds, and high sulfite content. It has the advantage of  
 
wide processing latitude and excellent chemical stability, but the dot quality 
obtained is relatively poor. The "lith" processing system is characterised by a low 
free sulfite content and the application of hydroquinone as sole developing agent, 
as described by J.A.C. Yule in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. 
239,221-230 (1945). It produces excellent dots and print results, but has very poor 
chemical stability and it needs long developing times. Several alternatives to using a hydroquinone
