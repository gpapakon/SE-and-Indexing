<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method in branching a tube (10) by means of a tube element (12) having a smaller diameter than the tube. An aperture (11) with substantially elliptic shape is made in the wall of the tube and a flange (13), also with substantially elliptic shape, at one end of the tube element (12) is inserted into the aperture from the outside of the tube and is clamped at an intermediate sealing ring against the inside of the tube and is locked in the clamped position. At a predetermined width f of the flange and at a predetermined dimension a of the major axis of the aperture the major axis A and the minor axis B of the flange and the minor axis b of the aperture are determined in accordance with the relationships: b = (a + f) sin  alpha , A = a + 2f, B = b + 2f, wherein  alpha  is the angle between the flange and the axis of the tube element, all dimensions relating to the projection of the aperture and the flange, respectively, on a plane surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method in branching a 
tube having a larger diameter, wherein an oval aperture 
is made in the tube wall and a flange at one end of a 
tube element having a smaller diameter, is inserted into 
the aperture from the outside of the tube and at an 
intermediate sealing ring is clamped against the inside 
of the tube and is locked in the clamped position. For example, the intention may be to provide a 
branch at a predetermined angle on an underground sewer 
in a street for connecting a service line to a building. To provide a branch as indicated is described in 
for example EP-C-307 413. The method is applied mostly to 
plastic tubes but the method can be applied also to tubes 
of other kinds. Usually the branching is made at an angle 
of 45° but also other angles can be provided or can be 
prescribed by an authority. The tube element forming the branch on the larger 
tube is mounted by being rotated 90° when inserted into 
the aperture in the tube wall. Then the aperture in the 
tube wall and the flange on the tube element must have 
such dimensions that a sufficiently large sealing surface 
is available on the flange to obtain the required 
sealing, but at the same time it must be taken into 
account that the aperture in the tube wall should not be 
so large in the peripheral direction of the tube that the 
tube will be substantially weakened. This means that the 
length of the minor axis extending in the peripheral 
direction of the tube must be limited. If the aperture in 
the tube is congruent with the profile obtained when the 
tube is cut at the predetermined angle of the branch, and 
if it should be possible to mount the tube element 
through the aperture in the tube, the width of the 
flange, i.e. the sealing surface, must be 0. Thus, the 
width of the aperture, i.e. the minor axis of the 
aperture, must be larger than the minor axis of the  
 
profile of the cut in order to obtain a sealing surface 
at all. On the other hand the aperture in the tube wall 
must not be made larger than is absolutely necessary 
because the aperture causes a weakening of the tube, 
especially in the peripheral direction thereof, for which 
reason the dimension of the aperture in the peripheral 
direction should be limited as far as possible. The object of the invention is to optimize the 
branching in order to provide the required sealing 
surface on the flange, the weakening of the tube being 
minimized, and for this purpose the method according to 
the invention has obtained the
