<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to release liners, and more 
particularly, to release liners suitable for use with 

highly aggressive pressure-sensitive adhesives. Certain 
pressure-sensitive adhesives, particularly those derived 

from silicone resins, are so aggressive that tapes 
employing them exhibit undesirably high peel forces upon 

removal from known low-adhesion coatings, especially after 
prolonged storage or when used in a high-temperature 

environment. The adhesive of such tapes may carry away, 
and consequently, be contaminated by appreciable amounts 

of the low-adhesion material. If this occurs, the tapes 
will exhibit poor readhesion when applied to "end-use" 

receptor surfaces. This invention provides curable, 
crosslinkable compositions and coatings prepared therefrom 

that can be used to form low-surface energy liners that 
can be used with aggressive pressure-sensitive adhesives, 

such as adhesives formed from silicone resins. The 
release characteristics of these coatings do not diminish 

upon aging and do not adversely affect the readhesion 
properties of adhesives that have come in contact with the 

coatings. The invention further provides substrates 
bearing a layer of the composition of the invention. 

These coated substrates are particularly suitable for 
release liners, especially differential release liners and 

low-adhesion backsizes for pressure-sensitive adhesive 
tapes and sheet materials, especially for 

pressure-sensitive adhesives derived from silicone resins. 
Because the coatings of this invention can have more than 

50% by weight inert oils without significantly reducing 
the readhesion of adhesives removed from them, they 

provide an economic advantage over those coatings prepared 
by using only the more expensive reactive group-containing 

polyfluoropolyethers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to release liners, and 
more particularly, to release liners suitable for use with 
highly aggressive pressure-sensitive adhesives. Pressure-sensitive adhesive tape, which is 
typically wound into rolls, has a low-adhesion backsize 
coating applied to the major surface of the backing not 
bearing adhesive to permit the tape to be unwound without 
delamination and transfer of adhesive to the surface of 
the backing not bearing adhesive. The force required to 
separate the adhesive layer from the low-adhesion backsize 
coating, i.e., peel force, ranges from 6 to 35 Newtons per 
decimeter (N/dm) per unit width. If the tape is not wound 
into a roll, its adhesive layer is customarily protected 
by a disposable web that bears a low-adhesion coating to 
which normally tacky and pressure-sensitive adhesives 
adhere very weakly, e.g., a peel force ranging from about 
0.2 to about 6 N/dm, preferably 0.2 to 2 N/dm. Release 
coatings having peel forces in this preferred range of 0.2 
to 2 N/dm are hereinafter referred to as "premium release" 
coatings. Release coatings must both adhere strongly to 
the backing and be sufficiently cured or rendered 
incompatible with the adhesive so that it does not 
transfer to the adhesive layer and adversely affect 
adhesive power of the adhesive. Low adhesion backsize 
coatings having such properties are disclosed in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 3,318,852; 3,536,749; 4,057,596; and 
4,216,252.  
 Certain pressure-sensitive adhesives, 
particularly those derived from silicone resins, are so 
aggressive that tapes employing them exhibit undesirably 
high peel forces upon removal from known low-adhesion 
coatings, especially after prolonged storage or when used 
in a high-temperature environment. The adhesive of such 
tapes may carry away, and consequently, be contaminated by 
appreciable amounts of the low-adhesion material. If this 
occurs, the tapes will exhibit poor readhesion when 
applied to "end-use" receptor surfaces. Known low-adhesion coatings, e.g., 
poly(urethanes), poly(tetrafluoroethylenes), and 
poly(dimethylsiloxanes), do not provide release peel 
forces in the range 0.2 to 2 N/dm when used with 
poly(dimethylsiloxane) adhesives. The utility of polymeric fluorocarbons as 
release coatings has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,472,480; 4,567,073; and 4,614,667. Uncrosslinked 
fluorinated waxes and oils are frequently used as 
lubricants and mold release agents in applications where 
low adhesion coatings are designed to fail cohesively 
within the
