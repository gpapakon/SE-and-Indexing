<ABSTRACT>
A digital audio and video signal recording system 
and method wherein erasure of a channel has no major 

effect on adjoining audio signals in the case of high 
density recording. The same channel of audio signals 

are recorded arranged in blocks in a direction 
orthogonal to the helical track of the magnetic tape. 

There is a possibility of the occurrence of error at 
the two outside tracks due to narrowing of the tracks 

at the time of editing of a channel, but preferably an 
outer code is added to enable erasure correction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
system (apparatus) for recording a digital audio
signal and a digital video signal, more particularly
relates to a digital audio and video signal recording
method and apparatus for arranging into blocks the
same channel of digital audio signals and recording
them in a direction orthogonal to the helical
(inclined) tracks of the recording medium and a
recording medium on which audio signals are recorded
in this way.In a system for recording and reproducing analog
video signals and analog audio signals (analog type
VTR), the video signals are recorded on the helical
tracks of a magnetic tape and the audio signals are
recorded at the edges running along the longitudinal
direction of the magnetic tape at the areas outward
from where the video signals are recorded.Also, in a system for recording and reproducing
digital video signals and digital audio signals on a 
magnetic tape (digital VTR), for example, in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 56-56075, it has
been proposed to record the audio signals on the helical
tracks with the same orientation as the video signals from
the viewpoint of the advantages of the prevention of loss
of audio signals when scratches etc. occur in the
longitudinal direction of the magnetic tape, the ability
to record and reproduce by the same rotary magnetic head,
etc.Further, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 58-188304, it has been proposed to
change the recording positions of different channels of
audio signals with the aim of rescuing "dropouts" at the
time of reproduction when recording a plurality of
channels of audio signals on the helical tracks of a
magnetic tape.Still further, for example, in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 58-188305, a so-called
method of "H-arrangement" has been proposed to record a
plurality of different types of information on helical
tracks in separate zones and to record information
recorded in a plurality of related adjoining tracks so
that their recording positions are aligned on a line
orthogonal to the direction of extension of the tracks so
that when erasing information recorded on a certain 
helical track by an erasure use rotary magnetic head
at the time of editing etc., it is possible to prevent
information recorded on tracks adjoining the erased
helical track from being erased and, further, it is
possible to prevent the length of the guard-band from
becoming longer.None of these recording methods is intended to
record a
