<ABSTRACT>
Device for displaying a movement of a patient, preferably of a body part being diagnosed or treated by means of radiation. A modulated semiconductor laser (12) generating a punctiform or linear beam is provided, as is an optoelectronic receiving device (14) which receives the light beam reflected from a retroreflector element (18) attached to a patient, and generates a corresponding signal. A display and/or alarm device (24) is connected to the receiving device in order to generate a display and/or alarm signal.

<CLAIMS>
A device for indicating the motion of a patient, the device comprising a semi-conductor
light source generating a beam and an opto-electronic receiving means

(14) which receives the light beam horn a retro-reflector element attached to the
patient and generating a corresponding signal, an indicating and/or alarm means

(24) being connected to the receiving means (14) for generating and/or alarm
signal, characterized in that the light source is a semi-conductor laser which

generates a line-shaped beam (16) which is directly projected onto the patient
(20) and that the semi-conductor laser (12) and the receiving means (14) are

accommodated in a common housing.
