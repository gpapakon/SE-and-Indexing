<ABSTRACT>
An improvement in the oxidation catalyst used for the partial oxidation of n-butane and containing vanadium and phosphorus, zinc, lithium and molybdenum mixed oxides which comprises carrying out the crystallization step under static conditions which allows for more uniform conditions for crystal growth. The static conditions are maintained by refluxing the solvent during the period of crystallization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
molybdenum containing PVO-zinc activated, lithium modified
catalyst for use the in the partial oxidation of
hydrocarbons to prepare dicarboxylic acids and anhydrides.
More particularly, the invention relates to an anhydrous
system for the preparation of phosphorus-vanadium mixed
oxide VPO catalyst.Basically, all of the methods used to prepare oxidation
catalysts seek to obtain vanadium in a valence state of
less than +5. One method of achieving this is to begin
with vanadium in less than the +5 valence state. Another
method and that used most widely in the art is to start
with vanadium in the +5 state and reduce the valency to
less than +5. This invention relates to the latter method.
Several variations on this method have been used to obtain
these catalysts. In one method V2O5 is reduced in a
solution with HCl to obtain vanadyl chloride. A typical
catalyst preparation may involve dissolving the vanadium,
phosphorus, and other components in a common solvent. The
reduced vanadium with a valence of less than 5 is obtained
by initially using a vanadium compound with a valence of
plus 5 such as V2O5 and thereafter reducing to the lower
valence with, for example, hydrochloric acid during the
catalyst preparation to form the vanadium oxysalt, vanadyl
chloride, insitu. The vanadium compound is dissolved in a
reducing solvent, such as hydrochloric acid reduces the
valence of the vanadium compound to a valence of less than
5 and functions as a solvent for the reaction. Preferably,
the vanadium compound is first dissolved in the
hydrochloric acid and thereafter the phosphorus and other
components, if any, are added. The reaction to form the
complex may be accelerated by the application of heat. The
complex formed is then, without a precipitation step, 
deposited as a solution onto a carrier and dried.
Generally, the average valence of the vanadium will be
between about plus 2.5 and 4.6 at the time of deposition
onto the carrier.In another method the catalyst is prepared by
precipitating the metal compounds, either with or without a
carrier, from a colloidal dispersion of the ingredients in
an inert liquid. In some instances the catalyst may be
deposited as molten metal compounds onto a carrier. The
catalysts have also been prepared by heating and mixing
anhydrous forms of phosphorus acids with vanadium compounds
and other components. In any of the methods of
preparation, heat may be applied to accelerate the
formation of the complex.A method of obtaining
