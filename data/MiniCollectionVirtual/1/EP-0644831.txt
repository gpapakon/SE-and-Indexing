<ABSTRACT>
In light-induced thermal printing of images on to transparent receiver sheets, e.g. for 35mm transparencies, an improvement in sensitivity (i.e. the Optical Density of the final image that can be achieved for a given energy input) is improved by providing the dye sheet with a reflective layer positioned such that laser light projected through the receiver sheet and not absorbed on the first pass through the dye sheet is reflected back so as to be absorbed on a second pass. Alternatively, a sensitivity improvement may be achieved by positioning the transparent receiver sheet against a surface having a reflective layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to light-induced thermal printing and
particularly to dye sheets therefor.Thermal transfer printing is a generic term for
processes in which one or more thermally transferable dyes are
caused to transfer from a dye sheet to a receiver sheet in
response to thermal stimuli. Using a dye sheet comprising a thin
substrate supporting a dye coat containing one or more such dyes
uniformly spread over an entire printing area of the dye sheet,
printing can be effected by heating selected discrete areas of
the dye sheet whilst the dye coat is pressed against a receiver
sheet, thereby causing dye to transfer to corresponding areas of
that receiver sheet. The shape of the pattern transferred is
determined by the number and location of the discrete areas which
are subject to heating. Full colour prints can be produced by
printing with different coloured dye coats sequentially in like
manner and the different coloured dye coats are usually provided
as discrete uniform print-size areas in a repeated sequence along
the same dye sheet.A typical receiver sheet comprises a substrate supporting a
receiver coat of a dye-receptive composition containing a
material having an affinity for the dye molecules, and into which
they can readily diffuse when the adjacent area of dye sheet is
heated during printing. Such receiver coats are generally 2-6 Âµm
thick, and examples of suitable materials with good dye-affinity
include saturated polyesters soluble in common solvents to enable
them readily to be applied to the substrate as coating
compositions, and then dried to form the receiver coat.For efficient dye transfer, both the dye coat and the
receiver coat need to be heated and therefore,ideally, the
maximum heat should be generated at the interface between the dye
coat and the receiver coat. In conventional thermal printing
using a printing head, the heat is applied to the face of the dye
sheet remote from the dye coat and hence dye transfer relies on
the conduction of the heat through the dye sheet which inherently 
limits the sensitivity, ie. the Optical Density (OD) of the final
image that can be achieved for a given energy input.Recent developments have shown that the use of a laser as
the energy source can improve the sensitivity as well as
providing much higher resolution.As is well known, the use of a laser requires that there is
effective conversion of the light energy to thermal energy.
Whilst in principle this conversion could be effected by the dyes
themselves, in practice it is more usual, and

<CLAIMS>
A dye sheet for thermal printing comprising a substrate
supporting a dye coat containing one or more dyes transferable in

response to thermal stimulii, having the provision of
material for absorbing and converting laser light to heat to

provide the thermal stimulii and having the provision of a reflective
layer positioned such that laser light projected into the dye

sheet through the surface of the dye coat and not absorbed on the
first pass through the dye coat is reflected back so as to be

absorbed on a second pass.
A dye sheet according to claim 1, wherein the reflective
layer is interposed between the substrate and the dye coat.
A dye sheet according to claim 1, wherein the reflective
layer is positioned on the opposite face of the substrate to the

dye coat.
A dye sheet according to any preceding claim, wherein the
reflective layer has a reflectance of at least 15%.
A dye sheet according to any preceding claim, wherein the
reflective layer is aluminium.
An assembly for light induced thermal printing comprising a
dye sheet comprising a substrate supporting a dye coat containing

one or more dyes transferable in response to thermal stimulii,
and a transparent receiver sheet comprising a substrate

supporting a receiver coat containing a material having an
affinity for dye molecules, having the provision in the

dye sheet of material for absorbing and converting laser light to
heat to provide the thermal stimulii and of a reflective layer

positioned such that when the dye sheet and the receiver sheet
are pressed together, laser light projected into the dye sheet

through the surface of the dye coat and not absorbed on the first

A method of thermal printing comprising positioning a transparent
receiver sheet comprising a substrate supporting a receiver coat

containing a material having an affinity for dye molecules in
contact with a dye sheet comprising a substrate supporting a

reflective layer and, on the reflective layer or on its other
surface, a dye coat containing one or more dyes transferable in

response to thermal stimulii, and light absorbing material, and
applying thermal stimulii, wherein the thermal

stimulii are produced by projecting a laser into the dye coat,
where the laser light is absorbed and converted into heat by the

absorber material, such that any light not absorbed on the first
pass is reflected back so as to be absorbed on a second pass.
