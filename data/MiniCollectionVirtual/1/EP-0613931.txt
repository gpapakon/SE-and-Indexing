<ABSTRACT>
A bake hardenable steel sheet ready for deep drawing is coated on at 
least one side with a continuous chromium bearing epoxy coating. The sheet is 

roll coated with continuous liquid film containing at least 2 wt.% of a water 
dispersible or emulsifiable epoxy resin or a mixture of resins containing the 

epoxy resin, at least 0.5 wt.% of a chromium compound and 25-97 wt.% of water. 
The liquid coated sheet is induction heated at a temperature of 149-227°C for 

sufficient time to form a coating resistant to dissolution of chromium and a steel 
base metal having a yield point elongation no greater than 0.3 % and retaining 

good bake hardenability characteristics. The chromium bearing epoxy coating is 
impervious to moisture, can readily be welded and possesses sufficient 

toughness and lubricity to allow deformation of the sheet without additional 
external lubricant. A deeply drawn article formed from the sheet has enhanced 

painting characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for coating in one step a bake 
hardenable, bare or metallic coated, steel sheet with an induction cured 
thermosetting coating. More particularly, the coating is formed from an aqueous 
solution containing a thermosetting polymer and a chromium compound. The 
coating is formable, impervious to moisture, resistant to dissolution of the 
chromium and is capable of being bonded with a top coating of paint or 
adhesive. It is known to pretreat and/or prepaint steel substrates for improving 
corrosion resistance prior to post painting. The pretreatment generally is a two 
step process including initially applying a dried-in-place inorganic chromium 
primer having a weight of about 0.75 g/m2 or more followed by baking of a 
solvent based organic liquid coating, e.g., epoxy containing a silicate, having a 
weight of about 0.5-1.1 g/m2. The chromium layer beneath the organic layer is 
desirable because it retards the formation of corrosion products by inhibiting the 
hydration of metallic oxides. The organic topcoat provides additional barrier 
protection and is necessary to prevent dissolution of the chromium from the 
primer layer. Electroplating steel sheets with zinc nickel forms a relatively brittle metal 
coating that may have inferior adherence during stamping of the sheet and 
subsequent poor corrosion resistance. Applying an organic coating over the 
zinc nickel coating prior to painting of the sheet acts a barrier film inhibiting 
catastrophic corrosion during field service. Without the organic coating, it would 
be necessary to increase the thickness of the metallic coating to insure the 
necessary corrosion resistance. An increase of the metallic coating thickness, 
however, could adversely affect welding and formability of the sheet. US patent 
4,971,636 discloses coating a zinc coated steel sheet with a composite coating 
of chromium and epoxy resin using a two step process. The zinc coated steel is 
rinsed with a chromic acid solution, dried, coated with an aqueous solution 
containing epoxy and silica and the epoxy coated steel then is baked. In a more recent development EP-A-291260 (US patent 5,001,173) 
discloses a steel sheet pretreated in a one step process with an  
 
organic coating containing chromium. The coating is applied from a solution of 
2-25 wt.% of an organic resin component containing at least one water 
dispersible or emulsifiable epoxy resin or a mixture of resins containing more 
than 50 wt.% of at least one water dispersible or

A method of forming a corrosion resistant organic coating 
on at least one side of a steel sheet ready for deep 

drawing, including the steps of: 

providing an aqueous solution comprising at least 2 wt.%

wt.% of water, 
coating a continuous liquid film of the solution onto a 
bake hardenable steel sheet, 
passing the liquid coated sheet through an induction 
heater, and 
induction heating the sheet at a temperature of 149-227 °C

cured and for the chromium to be reduced to a stable form 
within the organic coating, and thereby to form a chromium

to dissolution of chromium and the steel base metal has a 

yield point elongation no greater than 0.3 % and retains
