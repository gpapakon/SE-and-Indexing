<ABSTRACT>
In two processing channels, which are preferably implemented separately, process representations are generated from the same source data, and stored, independently of each other. Reduced check data (PD1, PD2) are formed from the stored data using a known mathematical or other mapping method, and then checked for agreement of content. As long as this agreement of content exists, the video memories (FB1, FB2) provide data, which permit accurate process representation, to the display unit (S). This test process takes place at specified minimum time intervals, or is event-controlled before the output of safety-critical commands, execution of which is not additionally tested separately. The invention is particularly intended for use in signal boxes and control centres.
