<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device whereby a photoresist 
layer (3) is provided on a surface (1) of a slice of semiconductor material (2), after 

which two photomasks (4, 5; 50, 51; 60, 61; 70, 71) corresponding to adjoining 
portions of a pattern (6) to be formed in the photoresist are projected on the photoresist 

by means of a projection lens, with overlapping edges (7, 8). Strip-shaped transparent 
end portions (10, 11; 52, 53; 62, 63; 72, 73) of the two photomasks which are situated 

within this edge and which overlap one another in projection are provided with strip-shaped 
connection patterns (30; 54, 55; 64, 65; 74, 75) which overlap one another in 

projection and which exhibit a complementary transmittance in projection. To keep the 
quantity of computer data necessary for describing the photomasks comparatively small, 

the strip-shaped transparent end portions of the two photomasks overlapping one another 
in projection are provided at their edges only with strip-shaped connection patterns 

overlapping one another in projection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor
device whereby a photoresist layer is provided on a surface of a slice of semiconductor
material, after which photomasks corresponding to mutually connecting portions of a
pattern to be formed in the photoresist are projected onto the photoresist by means of a
projection lens, with pattern edges superimposed on one another, while strip-shaped
transparent end portions of the photomasks situated within this edge and mutually
overlapping in projection are provided with strip-shaped connection patterns which
overlap one another in projection and which exhibit a complementary transmittance in
projection.In such a method, a pattern which is too large for being projected by
means of a single photomask onto a layer of photoresist is subdivided into mutually
adjoining partial patterns which are accommodated in different photomasks. These
photomasks are projected onto the photoresist with overlapping edges each time, so that
the portions of the pattern to be formed merge into one another again in projection.
Integrated circuits may thus be manufactured which cover a comparatively large surface
area of the semiconductor slice. The total pattern in the photoresist layer is then formed
by the transparent end portions which overlap in projection and lie inside the edges and
by the transparent end portions of the masks which do not overlap in projection and are
not situated within the edges.EP-A-434142 discloses a method of the kind mentioned in the opening
paragraph whereby strip-shaped transparent end portions of the photomasks overlapping
one another in projection are provided over their entire surface areas with connection
patterns having a transmittance which shows a gradient seen in the longitudinal direction
of the strip-shaped transparent end portions. This is achieved in that these strip-shaped
transparent end portions are provided with non-transparent regions whose number
and/or size changes in the longitudinal direction of the strip-shaped end portions and
which are not imaged individually in projection. Were the photomasks not provided with such connection patterns, then the
photoresist layer would receive a total radiation dose at the area of the transparent
portions overlapping one another in projection which is twice the radiation dose at the
area of transparent portions of the photomasks not overlapping one another in
projection. The transparent portions which overlap in projection would then receive a
double radiation dose. With

transparent end portions (10,11) of the photomasks (4,5) which overlap one another in projection are

provided at their edges (31) with strip-shaped connection patterns (30) having a width which,
upon projection on the photoresist, is greater than 0.2 I/NA, where I is equal to the

wavelength of the radiation used in the projection, and NA is equal to the numerical
aperture of the projection lens used in the projection.

connection patterns (30) overlapping one another in projection comprise transparent

regions which are formed as rectangular regions (56,57,66,67) with a length and a width which are

complementary transmittance which remains constant over their entire surface in
projection.

transmittance of substantially 50% over their entire surface.
