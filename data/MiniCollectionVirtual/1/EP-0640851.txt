<ABSTRACT>
The improved infrared heat reflector comprises a fiber-reinforced 
resin matrix composite 

having low infrared surface reflectivity and a quarter-wave optical 
coating on a surface 

of the composite to increase the reflectivity in a portion of the 
infrared and provide the 

surface with dichroic reflection characteristics. 
The optical coating comprises at least one layer of a solid dielectric 

or semiconductor, having a refractive index greater than 3 in the 
infrared spectrum and an optical thickness of 0,5 to 8µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to infrared reflectors having dichroic reflection characteristics. 
The reflectors may be particularly useful in applications where it is desired to 
maximize radiant energy output at particular wavelengths, selectively improving heat 
transfer. All bodies at a temperature above absolute zero radiate energy. For most bodies at 
moderate temperatures, the energy radiated falls in the infrared region of the 
electromagnetic energy spectrum and is commonly called radiant heat. At temperatures 
where the energy source becomes luminous, the energy output will include the visible 
portion of the spectrum as well. Active radiant heat sources are readily available and 
are in wide use. The familiar steam- or fluid-heated radiator may be classified as a dull 
or low temperature source of radiant energy, as are a great many other widely used 
heat sources, for example, resistance heaters, radiant heat panels, ceramic-walled 
space heaters and the like. High temperature or bright energy sources such as 
ordinary incandescent lamps, vitreous quartz glowbars, electrical resistance elements, 
halogen lamps, certain forms of industrial lasers and even focussed sunlight are also 
well known and widely used. Transfer of energy by radiant means occurs over distances, even in a vacuum. Unless 
an object is perfectly transparent, a portion of all of the radiant energy incident upon a 
surface will be absorbed, and a portion reflected. A highly reflective surface will 
reflect substantially all of the incident radiation, absorbing little energy. Reflectivity of 
a surface varies with the wavelength of the incident radiation; that is, a surface does 
not absorb energy equally at all wavelengths. Most non-metallic materials are good 
absorbers over much of the infrared portion of the spectrum, and many organic 
materials have principle absorption bands at wavelengths in the portion from about 2 
to about 5.5 µm, a band termed by some references the thermal heating band. Radiant 
heat sources intended for use in toasting or browning are selected to provide a high-energy 
flux in this portion of the spectrum. In addition, since water and carbon 
dioxide also absorb strongly at wavelength bands within this region, substances 
containing high levels of water, for example, latex films, moist solids and the like, 
may be efficiently dried by using radiant energy in this wavelength region as a means 
for heating.  Design of radiant heating devices is generally directed toward providing maximum 
energy output
