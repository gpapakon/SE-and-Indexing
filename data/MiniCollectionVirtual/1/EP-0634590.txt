<ABSTRACT>
Method for regulating a transmission unit for motor 
vehicles, more particularly for regulating a transmission 

unit of the type that uses a continuously variable 
transmission (2) and that comprises at least a primary 

pulley (3) on an input shaft (4), a secondary pulley (5) 
on an output shaft (6), an endless transmission element 

(7) between said two pulleys (3, 5), a first pressure 
cylinder (8) which operates with the primary pulley (3), 

and a second pressure cylinder (9) which operates with 
the secondary pulley (5), whereby the pulleys (3, 5) and 

the pressure cylinders (8, 9) enable the running radiuses 
(R1, R2) of the endless transmission element (7) on the 

pulleys (3, 5) to be altered, and thus also the 
transmission ratio, characterised in that both the 

primary and the secondary pressure, or in other words 
both the pressure in said first pressure cylinder (8) and 

the pressure in said second cylinder (9), can be 
regulated by means of a control system, whereby a control 

mechanism is created which provides for a controlled 
basic pinching force and a controlled selection force, 

which can be superimposed both on the primary and on the 
secondary side of the transmission respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for regulating the 
transmission unit on motor vehicles, and a transmission 
method using this method. More particularly, it concerns transmission units of the 
type using a continuously variable transmission 
comprising at least a primary pulley on an input shaft, 
a secondary pulley on an output shaft, an endless 
transmission element between the two pulleys, a first 
pressure cylinder that operates on the primary pulley, 
and a secondary pressure cylinder that operates on the 
second pulley, whereby said pulleys and pressure 
cylinders enable the running radius of the endless 
transmission element on the pulleys to be altered, and 
with it the transmission radius. It is known that on the transmission units of the above-mentioned 
type existing until now, the pressure in only 
one of the above-mentioned two pressure cylinders - more 
particularly the pressure cylinder belonging to the 
secondary pulley - is usually kept at a certain value, 
such that a certain pinching force is exercised, while 
the primary pulley is regulated exclusively by means of 
a volume flow, such regulation being known as flow 
regulation, for the purpose of setting the transmission 
ratio. A disadvantage of these known transmission units 
is that under certain dynamic conditions they have 
limitations; in other words, they do not meet the  
 
requirements placed on them. The known transmission units of the above-mentioned type 
have among other things the characteristic that the 
primary pressure, in other words the pressure prevailing 
in the above-mentioned first cylinder, can vary greatly, 
even falling below the slip threshold. This pressure, 
for example, is equal to zero when stationary. Until 
now, it has been assumed that the pinching force on the 
second pulley leads to an equilibrium force on the 
primary pulley. However, this appears to be possible 
only to a limited extent, which under extreme conditions 
accordingly results in slip at the transmission element. 
For instance, in case of very hard braking the 
transmission must return to its original position before 
it is possible to pull away again, otherwise slip occurs. 
This can be achieved by using higher revolution speeds 
for regulation, for example 1,700 rpm, which however is 
undesirable from the point of view of optimum fuel 
consumption. An improvement is known from document JP 1116365, 
according to which a pressure is added to or subtracted 
from a reference pressure. A great disadvantage hereby 
consists in that the

Method for regulating a transmission unit for motor 
vehicles, more particularly for regulating a transmission 

unit of the type that uses a continuously variable 
transmission (2) and that comprises at least a primary 

pulley (3) on an input shaft (4), a secondary pulley (5) 
on an output shaft (6), an endless transmission element 

(7) between said two pulleys (3, 5), a first pressure 
cylinder (8) which operate
s with the primary pulley (3), 
and a second pressure cylinder (9) which operates with 

the secondary pulley (5), whereby the pulleys (3, 5) and 
the pressure cylinders (8, 9) enable the running radiuses 

(R1, R2) of the endless transmission element (7) on the 
pulleys (3, 5) to be altered, and thus also the 

transmission ratio, characterised in that both the 
primary and the secondary pressure, or in other words 

both the pressure in said first pressure cylinder (8) and 
the pressure in said second cylinder (9), can be 

regulated by means of a control system, whereby a control 
mechanism is created which provides for a controlled 

basic pinching force and a controlled selection force, 
which can be superimposed both on the primary and on the 

secondary side of the transmission respectively. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a value is selected for the basic pinching force which is 

slightly higher than the value at which slip occurs 
between the endless transmission element (7) and the 

pulleys (3, 5). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the basic pinching forces applied to the pressure 

cylinders (8, 9) are derived from the engine torque and 
the transmission ratio of the transmission (2). 
Method according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that in determining the above-mentioned 

selection forces on the primary and secondary side 
respectively, at least the difference between the 

required and the measured speed of revolution is taken 
into account. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that 
in the case where the required selection force is less 

than zero, both a basic pinching force and a selection 
force are provided on the primary side, while on the 

secondary side only a basic pinching force is provided, 
and that in the case where the required selection force 

is greater than zero, only a basic pinching force is 
provided on the primary side, while both a basic pinching 

force and a selection force are provided on the secondary 
side. 
Method according to any of the above claims, 
characterised in that determining the transmitted torque 

from the coupling pressure, and determining the pinching 
forces on the basis of this, is done such that the 

endless transmission element (7) can always transmit more 
torque than the coupling. 
Transmission unit using the method of claim 1 and 
being of the type mentioned in claim 1, characterised in 

that it comprises a control system (15) which ensures 
that the pressure in both the first pressure cylinder (8) 

 
and in the second pressure cylinder (9) is controlled, 

and which provides a controlled basic pinching force and 
a controlled selection force both to the primary and to 

the secondary side of the transmission (2). 
Transmission unit according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the control system (15) comprises 

at least a regulator (16) which supplies a signal (20) 
representing the required selection force, whereby said 

signal takes into account at least the difference between 
the required and the measured speed of revolution; an 

arithmetic unit (17) which supplies a signal (21) that 
determines the basic pinching force and is derived from 

the engine torque and the transmission ratio of the 
transmission (2); signal processing means (18) which 

determine two control values (22, 23) and supply 
corresponding control signals (24, 25), whereby the first 

control value (22) is a function of the signal (21) from 
the arithmetic unit (17), so as to provide a basic 

pinching force in order to prevent slip, and, in the case 
where the required selection force is less than zero, 

which is also a function of said signal (20), so as to 
provide a corresponding additional selection force to the 

primary pulley (3), and whereby the second control value 
(23) is also a function of the signal (21) from the 

arithmetic unit (17), also so as to provide a basic 
pinching force, and, in the case where the required 

selection force is greater than zero, is also a function 
of the signal (20) from said regulator (16), so as to 

provide a corresponding additional selection force to the 
secondary pulley (5); and a hydraulic pressure regulation 

circuit (19) which converts said first control signal 
(24) into a pressure on the first pressure cylinder (8) 

and which converts said second control signal (25) into 
 

a pressure on the second pressure cylinder (9).

(19) is of the electro-hydraulic type and essentially 
comprises, on the one hand, pulse-controlled 

electromagnetic valves (39, 40), which provide the
