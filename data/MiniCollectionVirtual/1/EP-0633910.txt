<ABSTRACT>
A polymer composition comprising a mixture of a crystalline or semi-crystalline polyolefin A and a polymer B based on vinyl-aromatic and dicarboxylic acid anhydride monomer units. The polymer B is chemically crosslinked with a compound which contains at least two functional groups which are able to react with the dicarboxylic acid anhydride group of the polymer B; polymer B can also be physically crosslinked.

<DESCRIPTION>
POLYMER COMPOSITION COMPRISING A MIXTURE OF A CRYSTALLINE OR SEMI- CRYSTALLINE POLYOLEFIN AND A POLYMER BASED ON VINYLAROMATIC AND DICARBOXYLIC ACID ANHYDRIDE MONOMER UNITSThe invention relates to a polymer composition comprising a mixture of a crystalline or semi-crystalline polyolefin (A) and a polymer (B) based on vinyl-aromatic an dicarboxylic acid anhydride monomer units.A polymer composition of this type is known from WO-A-9005759. In WO-A-9005759 a polymer mixture of a crystalline or semi-crystalline polyolefin and a second polymer, such as a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride, is described. Since the polyolefin and the secon polymer are not miscible, the polymer mixture contains a compatibiliser. According to this publication, the compatibiliser is a block copolymer of a vinyl-aromatic compound and a conjugated diene or partially hydrogenated derivatives thereof. Here and hereafter a compatibiliser is understood to be a compound which improves the compatibilit of A and B and is primarily located at the interface of the polyolefin A and the polymer B. It is known from JP-A-63.205.341 to use styrene- containing rubber-like copolymers as compatibilisers in polymer compositions consisting of polypropene and styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers. A drawback of these polymer compositions is, however, that the impact strength/rigidity combination (Izod vs. modulus of elas¬ ticity) is poor, as a result of which the polymer com¬ positions are unsuitable for structural moulded components which are used in, for example, cars and furniture.The aim of the invention is to provide a polymer composition of a polyolefin A and a polymer B based on vinyl-aromatic monomer units and dicarboxylic acid anhydrid 

monomer units, which has a good impact strength/rigidity combination. The invention is characterised in that the polymerB is crosslinked. The crosslinking of the polymer B can be either of the chemical or the physical type. Physical crosslinking is effected under the influence of Van der aals forces, dipole-dipole interactions and ionogenic interactions.Polymer B can be chemically crosslinked by a reaction with a compound which contains at least two functional groups which are able to react with the dicarboxylic acid anhydride group of the polymer. A further advantage of the polymer composition according to the invention is that the elongation at break of the polymer composition increases.Another advantage of the polymer composition according to the invention is that the said composition also has good
