<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a welding method capable of forming an oxide passivation film having corrosion resistance and an 
extremely small emission quantity of an outgas during welding at a weld portion and portions nearby, and a process apparatus 

requiring an ultrahigh-clean atmosphere. A back-seal gas comprising an inert gas contaning 1 ppb to 50 ppm of oxygen gas in 
caused to flow during a welding process and an oxide passivation film comprising chromium oxide as a principal component is 

formed on the surface of a weld portion. In a process apparatus using welding for installing the apparatus, a back-seal gas comprising 
an inert gas containing 1 ppb to 50 ppm of oxygen gas is caused to flow during a welding process and an oxide passivation 

film comprising chromium oxide as a principal component is formed on the surface of a weld portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding method for 
forming a oxide passivation film on a weld and a process 
apparatus, particularly to a welding method making it 
possible to form a oxide passivation film mainly made of a 
chromium oxide film on the surface of a weld simultaneously 
with welding. The integration level and the performance of a 
semiconductor device have been improved, a semiconductor-device 
fabricating apparatus meeting the requests has been 
requested, and efforts for creating a higher-vacuum and 
higher-cleanliness atmosphere have been made. To create an ultrahigh-vacuum and very-high-cleanliness 
atmosphere, it is necessary to completely control the out-gas 
discharged from the apparatus or a gas feedind piping  
 
system. The inventors of the present invention completed a 
oxide passivation film treating method after long-time 
research and development, thereby it is possible to form a 
oxide passivation film having a corrosion resistance and a 
very small quantity of out-gas and mainly containing 
chromium oxide on the surface of a weld. As a result, they 
succeeded in creating an atmosphere containing only a very 
small quantity of out-gas discharged from the apparatus, 
which cannot be detected by an existing measuring 
instrument. However, as the apparatus is further increased in size 
and further complicated, the necessity for connecting a pipe 
with the apparatus after forming a oxide passivation film 
has increased. A new problem occures such as the atmosphere 
is contaminated because a weld is not covered with a oxide 
passivation film, gas is easily absorbed to or removed from 
the weld, therefore, when the welded places increased, the 
out-gas quantity discharged from the welds cannot be 
ignored. Moreover, an apparatus and a piping system using a 
corrosive gas has a problem that a weld is corroded and 
thereby contaminating the atmosphere. To form a oxide passivation film on a large complicated  
 
apparatus and piping system, a oxide passivation film 
forming apparatus is also complicated and the cost 
increases. Therefore, a welding method making it possible 
to form a passivation film simultaneously with welding was 
strongly requested. The present invention has an object to provide a 
welding method making it possible to form a oxide 
passivation film having a corrosion resistance and 
discharging only a very small quantity of out-gas on and 
around a weld during the welding process. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
process apparatus
