second member (33) wherein said first member is mounted 

on said second member and includes a radially extending 
surface (54a) spaced from an opposing radially extending 

surface (41a) of said second member, especially 
a hinge pivot mechanism (21) preferably for reclinable 

vehicle seats includes an eccentric planetary gear system, 
having a gear wheel (31) and a gear ring (32) 

which are mounted on an eccentric pivot member (33) and 
located between axially spaced shoulder surfaces (41a, 

54a) of the pivot member and a bushing (34) which is 
mounted on the pivot member, the pivot member having a 

shaft (43) with a pair of notches (45) located on opposite 
sides of the shaft and portions (59) of the sidewall 

of the bushing being pressed into the notches, 
forming a crimp connection between the bushing and the 

pivot member to maintain a predetermined axial spacing 
between the shoulder surfaces with the gear wheel contacted 

by one of the shoulder surfaces and the gear 
ring contacted by the other one of the shoulder 

surfaces to thereby maintain respective tooth systems  
 

(39,40) of the gear wheel and gear ring in operative 
relationship. Also disclosed is apparatus (60) for

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to assemblies, particularly to hinge 
pivot mechanisms for vehicle seat assemblies, having for 
example reclinable seat backs. Various hinge mechanisms have been proposed for vehicle seat 
assemblies which have reclinable seat backs. One such hinge mechanism of 
the so-called "Taumel" type includes an eccentric planetary gear system having 
a gear wheel and a gear ring which are mounted on a pivot axle which includes 
an eccentric portion. The gear wheel is connected to a fixed hinge which is 
secured to the seat cushion frame. The gear ring is connected to a pivotable 
hinge which is secured to the seat back frame. When the pivot axle is rotated, 
relative movement is produced between the gear wheel and the gear ring so 
that the pivotable hinge pivots relative to the fixed hinge, adjusting the 
inclination of the seat back relative to the seat cushion. A bushing, which is mounted on the distal end of the pivot axle, 
cooperates with the pivot axle to maintain the gear wheel and the gear ring in 
an operative relationship with one another. The bushing has a shoulder which 
is spaced axially from a shoulder of the pivot axle. The gear ring and the gear 
wheel are located between and in contact with the axially spaced shoulders of 
the pivot axle and the bushing. The bushing is a cap-like member which is 
received on the distal end of the pivot axle. The bushing is welded to the pivot 
axle at its distal end to maintain fixed the spacing between the shoulders,  
 
thereby maintaining a desired axial relationship between the gear wheel and 
the gear ring. The axial relationship between the gear ring and gear wheel is critical to 
proper operation of the hinge assembly. Failure to maintain the proper axial 
relationship may result in lateral play in the seat back and permit tilting of the 
seat back during adjustment of the seat back position or under collision 
conditions. Because the bushing is welded to the pivot axle, the bushing must 
"cap" the distal end of the pivot axle so that its inner end surface is in contact 
with the end of the pivot axle to define a weld surface. This fixes the axial 
position of the bushing on the pivot axle. Consequently, the tolerance on the 
shoulder-to-shoulder spacing that is achievable for this type of connection in a 
hinge assembly is typically on the order of .33 mm. A further disadvantage of this connection arrangement is that welding of 
the bushing to the pivot axle precludes surface hardening of the pivot axle.
