<ABSTRACT>
A lid (3) for a receptacle (2) includes a sealing portion (8) which, in use, is capable
of forming a hermetic seal between the lid (3) and an opening on the receptacle (2).

The lid (3) and the sealing portion (8) thereof are formed from the same polymer
composition and the sealing portion (8) comprises the composition in the form of

one or more foamed sections.
The lid (3) alleviates the problems of backing off and hermetic sealing and is
recyclable. Furthermore, it is capable of being formed in a single injection

moulding operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lid for a receptacle, to a process for its production and to
a container for a foodstuff which comprises the lid and a receptacle.In order to maximise the shelf-life of foodstuffs which are prone to atmospheric
deterioration or microbiological spoilage caused by contact with air and which are offered
to the consumer in screw lidded receptacles it is generally considered necessary to provide
a seal, between the lid and the receptacle, which is generally hermetic (i.e., substantially
or completely airtight). A hermetic seal can be difficult to achieve using a lid without an
inserted wadding or liner when the receptacle is made from glass or from plastics materials
formed into their final shape by a process incorporating a plastics extrusion stage and an
injection moulding stage. This is because the surface of such glass or plastics
receptacles, at the sealing surface of the receptacle over which the lid is applied, can be
inherently rough. Thus, it is conventional in the art to use a lid which has sealing media,
such as wadding or a deformable lining material inserted into the lid, to seal more
effectively against surface irregularities that occur in the sealing surface of the receptacle.
A further problem suffered by a lid, which has no inserted sealing media, for a receptacle
onto which the lid is screw-fit is that the lid can loosen from the initial torque provided, a 
phenomenon known in the art as "back off". Loosening can be caused by the natural
creep of the materials used or during transportation for instance by continued vibration.
It is, thus, difficult, in the absence of sealing media, to maintain sufficient torque on a
screw-fit lid to prevent it from unscrewing and thus weakening the seal.Attempts to solve the problem of providing a hermetic seal between a container and
a lid which is a screw-fit with the container have involved the use of a deformable insert or
seal in the lid. Thus, it is known to provide sealing media, e.g., a wad of deformable
material in the lid to solve the problems of sealing and to improve the maintenance of
torque to reduce backing off. The incorporation of sealing media into the lid takes place
after the lid has been formed, either by simply physically positioning a wad of deformable
material in the lid or by injection moulding two plastics materials in a single operation into
a single injection moulding cavity; one material being used to produce the load bearing cap
and a further deformable material being injected into the sealing

<CLAIMS>
Lid for a receptacle which lid includes a sealing portion which, in use, is
capable of forming a hermetic seal between the lid and an opening on

the receptacle, wherein the lid and the sealing portion thereof are
formed from the same polymer composition and wherein the sealing

portion comprises the composition in the form of one or more foamed
sections and wherein, in use, the one or more foamed sections are

capable of coming into direct contact with the opening and/or a sealing
surface of the receptacle.
Lid as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sealing portion is adapted to
abut the sealing surface of the receptacle.
Lid as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the receptacle is a bottle
or jar formed from glass or a plastics material.
Lid as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, further comprising means for
releasable attachment to the receptacle.
Lid as claimed in claim 4, wherein said means for releasable
attachment comprises a portion on the lid which is adapted for

corresponding engagement with a formed portion at the neck and/or
mouth of the opening on the receptacle.
Lid as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, which is produced by a
process comprising injection moulding of the composition.
Lid as claimed in claim 6, wherein the sealing portion is formed by
selective blowing of the composition at predetermined locations of the

lid.
Process for producing the lid of any one of claims 1 to 7, comprising
injection moulding a polymeric composition to form an intermediate

moulded body and then selectively blowing a part or parts of the
intermediate moulded body to form the sealing portion of the lid.
Process as claimed in claim 8, wherein the selective blowing of the part
or parts of the moulded body is achieved by forming the said part or

parts at a greater thickness than the remainder of the body such that
the composition in those parts is soft when the moulded body is

released from the mould.
Process as claimed in claim 9, wherein the part or parts are selectively
blown by introducing a gas into the composition and then reducing the

pressure on the moulded body to allow the gas to expand the
composition in those parts which are soft.
Process as claimed in claim 9, wherein the gas comprises carbon
dioxide.
Container for a foodstuff comprising a receptacle for the foodstuff and a
lid according to any one of claims 1 to 7.
