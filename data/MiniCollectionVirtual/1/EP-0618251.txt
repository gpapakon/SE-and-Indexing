<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of highly functional, low-viscosity, pale polyethers in which firstly, at temperatures of 20 - 110@C, an initiator mixture is prepared which contains:     component A) 100 parts by weight of sucrose, component B) 30-1,000 parts by weight of a low-molecular-weight, polyhydric alcohol and/or an alkoxylation product thereof, component C) [0.5-3] . 10

 parts by weight of an alkali metal hydroxide, and the mixture is subsequently reacted with alkylene oxides at 90 - 130@C and at pressures of 0.3 - 4 bar nitrogen overpressure.

viscosity, light coloured polyethers, characterised in

that a starter mixture consisting of:

component A)
100 parts by weight of sucrose
component B)

molecular weight of 62 to 420 and/or

the alkoxylation product thereof
component c)
[0.5-3] · 10
-3
 parts by weight of an
alkali metal hydroxide

is initially produced at temperatures of 20-110°C and
the mixture is then reacted with alkylene oxides at

85-130°C and nitrogen excess pressures of 0.3-4 bar.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that a
water soluble polyol and/or the alkoxylation product

thereof is used as component B.
Process according to claims 1-2, characterised in that
mixtures of polyols and/or the alkoxylation products

thereof are used as component B.
Process according to claims 1-3, characterised in that
potassium hydroxide is used as a concentrated aqueous

solution and/or as an alkoxide of the relatively
highly functional polyether polyol. 
Process according to claims 1-4, characterised in that
potassium hydroxide is used at a concentration of 500-3000

ppm, preferably 600-2500 ppm.
Process according to claims 1-5, characterised in that
2-90 wt.% of ethylene oxide and 10-98 wt.% of

propylene oxide and/or 1,2-butylene oxide are used as
the alkylene oxides.
Process according to claims 1-6, characterised in that
the alkylene oxide used is ethylene oxide, propylene

oxide and/or 1,2-butylene oxide either in succession
or as a mixture in a single batch.
Process according to claims 1-7, characterised in that
the alkylene oxides are used in a quantity wherein

each OH group is reacted with 0.5-4.0 moles of
alkylene oxide.
