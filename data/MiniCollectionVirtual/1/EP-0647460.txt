<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention consists of a device 
for washing metal-containing sludges, said device comprising 

a screw feeder (2) cylinder bearing blades (3) placed between 
the turns and rotatably supported in both senses on its 

horizontal axis within a fixed cylinder containing a 
washing fluid, said fluid being circulated between the 

inside of the screw feeder cylinder and the gap between 
the same and the fixed cylinder. The exhausted washing 

fluid is removed and is replaced within the fixed cylinder 
by fresh washing fluid, according to the adjustment of a 

level control. Said screw feeder cylinder is caused to 
rotate in both senses so as to cause the sludge to be 

washed to go forward and backward so meeting the washing 
fluid inside the cylinder itseld according to a predetermined 

washing program, and after such program has been 
realized, the sludge now washed is removed after filtering. 
Are also subjects of this invention a process for 
washing metal-containing sludges which makes use of such 

kind of device, and a product which is suitable to counteract 
the excess acidity of woodlands, said product being 

made up of the residual sludge of such process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of metal-containing 
sludge washing. More particularly, this invention relates to a 
device for washing metal-containing sludges. It further refers to a process for washing metal-containing 
sludges, which process involves the use of 
such kind of device. At last, this invention relates to a product 
suitable to counteract the excess acidity of woodlands, 
said product being made up of the sludge residue of such 
process. Needs, both of environment and economic nature, of 
processing metal-containing sludges regardless of their 
origin, are widely known, in order to make such sludges 
no longer toxic and to recover metals which would be 
lost with them. Said sludges, even if they are placed in discharge 
places that meet the environment necessities, are always 
a pollution danger of water-bearing strata and a resource 
waste which resources when exhausted will not be available. 
As stated above, "even if", because there are not sufficient 
safe discharge places and not all the sludges 
finish to a discharge place. Therefore, the Applicant of this application had 
already suggested previously a method and device for 
treating such sludges in the Italian Patent no. 1,232,862, 
entitled "Metodo e Dispositivo per il Trattamento di 
Fanghi Contenenti Residui Metallici", (A Method and  
 
Device for Treating Metal Residue-Containing Sludges), 
issued on April 30, 1992 (corresponding application 
number 67501-A/89 of June 20,1989). Briefly, in such patent it was foreseen for metal-containing 
sludges a washing in equicurrent in a rotating 
chamber which rotates in a one sense. However, the yield of such kind of washing was not 
completely satisfying, or it was not much efficient and 
sludge contained appreciable traces of metals. It is the object of this invention to provide a 
device and process which allow to wash metal-containing 
sludges in a substantially complete way and in time which 
is economically valuable. By "substantially complete" it is meant in this 
disclosure that the sludge can contain metal traces just 
up to a few milligrams by kilogram. Such object is attained, according to the teaching 
of this invention, by means of the use of a washing 
chamber that is caused to rotate in both senses, which is 
provided in its inner part with means to cause its sludge 
content to go forward and backward, depending on the 
rotation sense, such means being made up of an Archimedean 
screw or screw, and of sludge lifting means, made up of 
blades placed between the turns
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for washing metal-containing sludges, 
said device comprising: 


a screw feeder cylinder (1) having on its inner surface a screw feeder 
with lifting blades 

(3) placed between the turns (2) of said screw feeder, the 
cylinder being arranged horizontally within a fixed envelope 

(1') and rotatably in both senses; 
driving means (14, 14' , 14'') for causing said screw 
feeder cylinder (1) to rotate in both senses so as to cause the sludge to 

be washed to go forward and backward inside the cylinder, 
and to be shaken in the same; 
said fixed envelope (1') containing the liquid for 
washing the sludge; 
means for circulating (11) and heating 
(12) said washing liquid between said fixed envelope 

(1') and said screw feeder cylinder (1), and means for 
feeding said washing liquid toward said fixed 

envelope and means for removing said washing liquid from said fixed envelope according to the 
adjustment of a level control (13); 
the washing liquid communication from the screw feeder 
cylinder (1) to the fixed envelope (1') being carried out 

through a filtering head (10); 
means for collecting the washed sludge 
(6) and 

means (8) for removing said collected sludge out of the fixed envelope; 
means for programming the difference between the number of revolutions 
per unit time of the screw feeder cylinder in one sense of rotation 

and the opposite sense of rotation as well as the total, in both senses 
of rotation, number of revolutions per unit time of said cylinder, and  

 
means for programming the amount of the washing 
liquid, the amount of the sludge to be introduced as well 

as of the amount of residual sludge to be removed per unit 
time. 
A process for washing metal-containing sludges, 
said process being characterized in that it comprises the  

 
steps of: 


(I) washing said metal-containing sludges by means of a device according to claim 
1, employing an ammonium chloride solution as the washing 

liquid; 
(II) drying the sludge residue; 
(III) washing again with neutralization the sludge 
residue by means of a device according to claim 1, with an 

ammonium sulfate solution, and 
(IV) re-drying of the neutralized sludge residue. 
A product suitable to counteract the excess 
acidity of woodlands, said product being made up of the 

neutralized, dry sludge residue, drenched with ammonium 
sulfate, which product is- obtained by means of the process 

according to claim 2.
