<ABSTRACT>
A machining unit, typically for wood panels (1), 
features a work table (2) afforded by a body (4) of 

prismatic geometry having at least two faces (5, 6) 
and rotatable about an axis (A) which is also its 

instantaneous centre, in such a way as to establish 
at least two movable and tiltable work surfaces; 

the prismatic body (4) is supported by a frame (8) 
encompassing the tool (3) and combining with the 

two faces (5, 6) to create respective independent 
work areas (5a, 6a), one in which panels (1) are 

fed to and from the unit, the other coinciding with 
a station at which machining takes place, and where 

waste and chips generated by machining are cleared 
from the table and the work. The prismatic body (4) 

also functions as the main barrier separating two 
work environments, the one an open external space 

occupied by the operator, the other an enclosure 
disallowing access to the operator while machining 

is in progress.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machining unit,
in particular a machine for routing and/or boring
wood preferably (though not exclusively) in the
form of predominantly flat panels.It is widely appreciated in the art field of wood-working
machines (the field to which the invention
specifically relates, though without excluding the
possibility of its application in similar fields
concerned generally with the processing of parts,
whether machining by the cutting of a chip, or the
fitment of fasteners, accessories, etc.) that one
of the factors most liable to influence the output
capacity of a work station, i.e. a unit composed of
a work table, infeed and outfeed sections and at
least one tool, is down time, or in the parlance of
some authors, time that cannot be "hidden".The significance of this expression derives from
the fact that time not strictly of an operational
nature (i.e. time needed to change the workpiece,
or to effect a change of tool, or a set-up, etc.) 
tends in reality almost never to be "covered" by a
parallel active step in which the tool engages the
work; this is even more of a drawback in machines
of the latest generation, using numerical control,
in which the typical operating times for tools are
far less than the times taken to change or position
the work: accordingly, one must conclude that such
machines do not effectively operate in a situation
where down time can be hidden, and consequently
that their technological sophistication is not in
proportion to their output potential.The main operations typically occasioning down time
are: the infeed/outfeed of work from/to a conveying
surface onto and from the table (almost invariably
horizontal) on which the work can be clamped and
positioned in relation to the tool; clearing the
work table of chips or dust generated by machining;
tipping solid scrap from the table; changing tools
at the end of the machining run and setting up for
a new size of piece, and so forth.Working to a general model of construction for a
machining unit composed, as already intimated, of a
horizontal table on which to secure the work and a
tool assembly mounted over or alongside the table,
it has been sought hitherto by means of particular 
expedients to minimize the down time in question:
by way of example, such expedients have centred on
the adoption of palletization equipment designed to
operate in conjunction with special feed systems
(some employing robotics) by which the workpieces
are supplied to the machining unit, as well as on
ways of speeding up the
