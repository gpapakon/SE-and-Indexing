<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method and a device for controlling an internal combustion engine, especially a diesel engine, with a fan (190) for cooling at least the charge air. A driving device (195) which drives the fan (190) can be controlled and/or regulated as a function of operating parameters.

Method for controlling an internal combustion
engine, in particular a diesel internal combustion

engine, having a fan for cooling at least the charge
air, having a drive device which can be open-loop

and/or closed-loop controlled as a function of an
operating characteristic variable and which drives the

fan, characterized in that a setpoint value for the
charge air temperature is specified as a function of

the load of the internal combustion engine, in that an
actual value of the charge air temperature is measured,

and in that a closed-loop controller which closed-loop
controls the charge air temperature to the setpoint

value forms an actuation signal for actuating the drive
device, and in that a start of injection is specified

as a function of the charge air temperature.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a lower setpoint value for charge air temperature

can be specified in the case of a high load than in the
case of a low load.
Device for controlling an internal combustion
engine, in particular a diesel internal combustion

engine, having a fan for cooling at least the charge
air, having a drive device which can be open-loop

and/or closed-loop controlled as a function of an
operating characteristic variable and which drives the

fan, characterized in that means are provided which
specify a setpoint value for the charge air temperature

as a function of the load of the internal combustion 
engine and measure an actual value of the charge air

temperature, and in that a closed-loop controller which
closed-loop controls the charge air temperature to the

setpoint value forms an actuation signal for actuating
the drive device, and in that the start of injection is

specified as a function of the charge air temperature.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the drive device can be actuated by an engine

control unit and/or by a fan control unit.
Device according to either of Claims 3 or 4,
characterized in that the drive device is a hydrostatic

blower drive.
