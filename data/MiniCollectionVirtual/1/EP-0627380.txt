<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a bobbin (1) made essentially or partially 
of a 

curable resin comprises the steps of: a) providing a mold (10) consisting 
of a 

male portion (12) and of a female portion (11), the gap (13) left between 
the said female 

and the said male portions, in their operational mounted position, being 
of the shape and dimensions of the bobbin (1) which it is desired to 

produce, 
the said mold (10) being provided with a resin inlet (18) and vacuum port 

(19) in 
communication with the said gap (13); b) laying on the surface of the 

male 
part (12) of the mold (10), or winding thereon, any element or material 

which it is 
desired to embed within the resin; c) inserting the male part (12) of 

the mold (10) 
into the female part (11) thereof and securely connecting the said two 

parts, 
the said two parts, when connected, being essentially sealed against 

pressure loss along their contact surfaces; d) causing a curable resin to 
flow into the said gap (13) through the resin inlet (18), while applying 

a vacuum at 
the vacuum port (19), until the empty space provided within the said gap 

(13) is 
substantially entirely filled with resin; e) allowing the resin to 

solidify; 
and f) opening the mold (10) and removing the bobbin (1) from the male 

part (12) thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for
manufacturing bobbins made of composite materials. More particularly,
the invention relates to an industrial process for manufacturing bobbins
adapted to support wound filaments, particularly for optical fibers.It is well known in the art to provide bobbins onto which there are wound
filaments to be paid out from the bobbin at a later time. One particularly
interesting example of filament is the optical fiber. Optical fibers are used
as communication links between moving objects and control stations,
because it is possible to wind a very long fiber, of the order of kilometers,
on a relatively small bobbin, and to transmit data along the fiber at a
high rate. Optical fiber canisters of this type, including an optical fiber
wound on a bobbin, are used in a variety of applications, e.g, for
communication purposes. Throughout this specification reference will be
therefore made to optical fibers, it being understood that the same
applies, mutatis mutandis, to other filaments as well.Bobbins adapted to be used as a base for optical fiber canisters can be
made in a variety of ways and from different materials. For instance, they
may be of aluminum, or can be made of composite material, such as
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,995,698. However, all prior art
manufacturing processes suffer from substantial drawbacks. In the case
of aluminum bobbins, for instance, it is necessary to work the surface of
the bobbin in order to produce the threaded grooved surface which is 
commonly required in order to lay the first layer of optical fiber.
Alternatively, the surface may be prepared for this purpose by other
methods, e.g., by winding first a base wire which creates the grooved
surface.In the case of a composite bobbin such as that made according to the
aforesaid U.S. patent, surface finishing is also needed, in order to smooth
out inequalities of the surface which may have greatly undesirable effect
on the winding of the optical fiber, and to provide the required grooved
surface. Additionally, the bobbin normally is made by stages, the first one
being manufacturing the main body which is frusto-conical in shape.
However, additional elements must be provided, e.g., for fasten the
bobbin onto the body from which the optical fiber is paid out. This is
normally achieved by providing anchoring means, e.g., a ring, connected
to the larger diameter of the bobbin. This of course requires an additional
operation, unless the bobbin is made of cast material, e.g.,

A method of manufacturing a bobbin (1) made essentially or partially
of a resin reinforced with embedded fibrous material which comprises

providing a mold (10) having a male part (12) and a female part (11), the gap
(13,14) left between the female and the male parts (12,11), in their connected

position, being of the shape and dimensions of the bobbin to be produced, said
mold (10) being provided with a resin inlet (18)in communication with the

said gap (13,14), said female part having a grooved inner surface (20), the
