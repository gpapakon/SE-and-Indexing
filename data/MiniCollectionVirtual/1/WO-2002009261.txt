<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a unipolar transverse flux machine, in particular a motor, with a rotor (12), comprising two coaxial, ferromagnetic, toothed rotor rings (14, 15), a permanent axially unipolar magnetised magnet ring (16), arranged between the above, a stator (11), concentric to the rotor shaft (13), a U-shaped stator yoke (19), representing the magnet pole, magnetic return elements (20) and a stator winding (21). In order to achieve an extremely flat construction and guarantee a defined start-up in a particular direction, the stator winding (21) is embodied with two coils (22, 23), the one coil side (221, 231) of which extends across a group of stator yokes (19) and magnetic return elements (20), sequentially arranged in the circumferential direction along the side of the magnetic return elements (20), facing away from the rotor shaft (13) between the arms of the yoke (19). The group spanned by the coil side (221) of the one coil (22) is arranged physically displaced by 90 DEG  on the stator circumference from the group spanned by the coil side (231) of the other coil (23).
