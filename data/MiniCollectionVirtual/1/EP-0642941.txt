<ABSTRACT>
The rain gutter (4) along each side of the roof opening has flanged side walls (5,6) with guides onto which a shaped end piece (9) is clipped with a push-fit assembly. Sprung tags (13,14) on the ends of the end connector locate in recesses (7,8) in the side flanges of the gutters. The end piece has an outlet (26) to which a drainage hose can be clipped. The end piece has a covered duct (22) at the end to guide the water to the outlet duct. A cross groove is injected with a sealing head (28) to seal onto the gutters when the end connector is pushed into place.

A frame of an openable vehicle roof with, extending
laterally of a roof opening, two frame parts (1) comprising

channels (4) for diverting penetrating water and each of
which is bounded by an end piece (9) disposed at the rear

end of the frame part (1) and on which there is a connecting
piece (26) for attachment of a water drain tube,

characterised in that the end piece (9) is fixed to the
frame part (1) by means of a separable clip connection

(15,16;7,8) and a rib connection (17,18; 5,6) comprising at
least one rib (5,6) which can be pushed into a slot-like

groove (17,18).
A frame according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
groove (17,18) comprises a run-on ramp (19) over which the

rib (5,6) can be inserted into the groove (17,18).
A frame according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
clip connection consists of a resiliently disposed tongue

(13,14) provided with a catch hook (15,16) and a recess
(7,8) formed on the mating piece (1) and shaped to match the

catch hook (15,16).
A frame according to Claim 3, characterised in that the clip
connection (15,16; 7,8) and the groove/rib connection

(17,18; 5,6) are so disposed in the jointing direction that
only after the rib (5,6) has been pushed completely into the

groove (17,18) does the clip connection snap into place.
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the end piece (9) has a covering (23)

at the top. 
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the end piece (9) comprises sloping

side walls (22,25) which converge towards the connecting
piece (26).
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the end piece (9) has a rigid closure

part (21) which projects rearwardly beyond the connection
piece (26).
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the end piece (9) comprises a part

(11) which projects laterally outwardly beyond the
connection piece.
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that a seal (28) is provided between the

rear edge of the frame part (1) and a run-on surface (20)
facing the said rear edge and provided on the end piece (9).
A frame according to Claim 9, characterised in that the seal
(28) is rigidly fixed on the end piece (9).
A frame according to Claim 10, characterised in that when
the end piece (9) is produced as a synthetic plastics

injection moulded part, the seal (28) is formed integrally
and directly on the end piece (9) by a two-component

injection moulding process,.
