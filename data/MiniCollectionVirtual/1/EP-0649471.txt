<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE "RECOMBINANT CELLULASES" FIELD OF INVENTION THIS INVENTION relates to recombinant cellulases derived from anaerobic fungi and a method of production of recombinant cellulases and clones utilised in the method.BACKGROUND ART Cellulose is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in nature and consists of a polymer of glucose linked by S-1 , 4-glucosidic bonds. Conversion of cellulose to simple sugars (cellobiose and glucose) involves at least two types of hydrolases: endoglucanases which hydrolyse internal 3-1 , 4- glucosidic linkages in less ordered regions of cellulose and exoglucanases (mainly cellobiohydrolases) which cleave cellobiosyl units from non-reducing ends of cellulose chains. Xylan, similar to the structure of cellulose, consists of a backbone of /3-1 , 4-linked xylose units. The enzymatic cleavage of 3-1,4- xylosidic linkages is performed by endo-3-1 , 4-xylanases (xylanases). These three types of enzymes usually exist separately as individual proteins, each with unique substrate specificity. Many endoglucanases cleave only internal β-λ ,4-glucosidic linkages, producing rapid depolymerisation of a model substrate, carboxymethyl cellulose (CM- cellulose); whereas cellobiohydrolases are able to hydrolyse crystalline cellulose and methylumbelliferyl cellobioside (MUC) and have no or little depolymerising activity against CM-cellulose. Similarly, many xylanases exclusively attack β- , 4-xylosidic linkages. However, not all polysaccharide hydrolases have strict substrate specificity. Due to the similarity in the chemical nature of the substrates, cross specificity occurs not only between two types of cellulase, but also between cellulases and xylanases. A large number 

of cloned cellulases from bacteria have been reported to possess some residual xylanolytic activity (usually < 1%) or vice versa (Saarilahti et al. , 1990; Yague et al. 1990; Hazelwood et al. , 1990; Flint et al., 1991; Taylor et al. , 1987) .Recent studies, based on partial enzyme purification, showed that rumen anaerobic fungi such as Neocalli astix frontalis might produce multi-functional polysaccharide hydrolases (Gomez de Segura & Fevre, 1991; Li & Calza, 1991). Multi-functional poly¬ saccharide hydrolases are of particular interest in genetic manipulation of rumen bacteria to enrich for the lignocellulose-degrading capacity. Simultaneous enhancement of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase and xylanase activities would facilitate the disruption of the complex structure of lignocellulose, of which cellulose and xylan are
