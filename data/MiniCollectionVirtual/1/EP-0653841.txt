<ABSTRACT>
A power control circuit is provided for coupling a load to a power 
source. It includes a transistor for coupling said load to the power 

supply through the transistor dependent upon a control voltage applied to 
a control terminal of the transistor, a charge pump circuit having its 

output connected to the transistor control terminal to apply a controlled 
turn on signal to the transistor when the charge pump is activated, 

wherein the controlled signal gradually increases until the transistor is 
biased into its fully on state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the interconnection of 
electronic cards to electronic system boards. The sudden connection of electronic cards to a powered system board 
can cause problems due to the surge current demanded by uncharged load 
capacitance on the cards. This surge current can cause damage to 
components of the circuit cards and disturb the operation of the system 
board or other cards connected thereto as power transients are generated 
as the power supply for the system board tries to compensate for a sudden 
change in loading. It is known to use connectors with contacts of different lengths to 
provide sequential voltage application when a card is inserted into a 
powered system, with the first to connect having a resistance to limit 
the surge current. This has been described in US patent 4,245,270 issued 
January 13, 1981 and assigned to Rockwell International Corporation. One 
problem with this arrangement is that under circumstances, such as 
quick insertion, the shorter, low resistance connection may make 
contact before the card has been fully charged through the limiting 
resistor defeating the protection. This would cause an uncontrolled 
surge of current to flow. Also, there is no control if the power is 
cycled off and on again with the card already installed as the shorter 
low resistance connection is in full contact with the power supply 
without benefit of the protection of the limiting resistor. Another approach is to use a linear voltage regulation 
scheme, with a controlled rate of change for the current, such as 
described in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 34, No. 4A, 
September 1991, pp. 9,10. This approach suffers from power loss in 
the mode used, and the voltage disturbances, caused by changes in load 
current, that result from the inherent system response time. The maximum level of current flow can be limited by circuits such 
as described by US patent 5,010,293 issued April 23, 1991 and assigned to 
Raynet Corporation. However this does not control the sudden flow of 
current up to the preset limit. This sudden change in current can still 
cause the system power supply to sense a fault and issue a reset pulse to 
the system disrupting normal system use.  Another approach is to use an electronic time delay to keep the 
adaptor card logic disabled until the disturbance caused by the surge 
current has passed. This is described in JP03-278214 and 3935-527. 
Holding the card logic disabled prevents it from creating any false 
signals, but it does not prevent
