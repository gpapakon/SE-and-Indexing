<ABSTRACT>
Various novel phosphono derivatives (XII) of amino acid esters such as the "nonphenyl-type" N-phosphono compounds of formula (IX): R6-CH(NR7-PO(OR4)(OR5))COOR3, the "phenyl-type" N-phosphono compounds of formula (X): R8-CH(NR9-PO(OR4)(OR5))COOR3, and the "phenylethylene-type" N-phosphono compounds of formula (XI): R10-CH(NR11-PO(OR4)(OR5))COOR3 are disclosed as being useful as antiinflammatory and antiarthritic agents. Further disclosed is a method of treating inflammatory and arthritic disease with known N-phosphono derivatives of amino acid esters, the "benzyl-type" N-phosphono compounds of formula (III): R1-CH(NR2-PO(OR4)(OR5))COOR3. Additionally disclosed are N,N'-diphosphonodiamine esters of formula (XV) and phosphonophosphinate esters of formula (XVIII): R14-X-(CW)m1-CR15R16-CH2-CM(P(O)(OR4)(OR5))(P(O)(OR4)(R19)) also useful for treating inflammatory and arthritic diseases.

 PHOSPHONO DERIVA TIVES AS ANTIINFLAMMATORY AND AISΓΠARTΉRΓΠC AGENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The phosphono derivatives (XII) of amino acid esters are useful as antiinflammatory and antiarthritic agents.2. Description of the Related Art French Patent M 6430 (1968) discloses derivatives of N-phosphoaspartic acid and their salts for treating psychic and physic asthenia. French Patents M 7690 (1970) and M3936 (1966) disclose salts of N-phosphohistidine and N-phospholysine for fatigue and as candiotonics.Synthesis 6 444-8 (1988) discloses synthesis of N-dimethylphosphoryl DL-phenylalanine ethyl ester.J. Am. Chem. Soc, 71, 1940 (1949) discloses synthesis of diphenylphosphoryl DL- phenylalanine ethyl ester.European Patent 0085488 (1983) discloses phosphono peptide derivatives as anti- hypertensive agents.Critical Reviews in Biochem., 16,51 (1984) reviews N-, O- and S-phosphoderivatives of amino acids, peptides and proteins. US Patent 5,720,274 discloses aryl etone bearing diphosphonates useful for aniinflammatory and/or antiarthritic use.WO 9,012,017 discloses pyrazoline diphosphonates useful for aniinflammatory and/or antiarthritic use.At the 203rd American Chemical Society National Meeting Spring 1992 (San Fransico) Medicinal Section; Abstract #210; pyrazoline diphosphonates were disclosed as being useful for antiinflammatory and/or antiarthritic use.J. Chem. Soc, 3614 (1971) discloses that diamines can be diphosphorylated with diphenylphosphite or diphenyl phosphorchloroidothionate to produce diphosphorylated diamines. J. Med. Chem., 27, 654 (1984) discloses how to prepare diphosphorylated diamine phenyl esters. The present invention does not include aromatic esters.J. Organomet. Chem., 312, 283 (1986) discloses the preparation of the ethylene phosphate ester (XVI) starting material for the preparation of the phosphonophosphinate esters (XVIII).Heterocycles, 30, 855 (1990) and EPO Publication 0 298 553 Al discloses phosphonophosphinate acids useful for promoting bone growth where the non-phosphate portion includes 2-pyridinyl substitution. The present invention includes esters but not acids, and are 

useful for a different purpose, namely treatment of inflammation and arthritis not bone growth.SUMMARY OF INVENTION Disclosed is a method of treating a human who has arthritis or an inflammatory disease with an antiarthritic effective amount or antiinflammatory effective amount of a "benzyl-type" N-phosphono compounds of formula (HI)RrCH[NR2-PO(OR4)(OR5)]COOR3 (ffl) where R, is
