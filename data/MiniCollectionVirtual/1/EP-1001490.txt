<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for assisting a telephone service subscriber in connecting
telephone equipment to a network services terminating point and in testing telephone

service to the terminating point. A network services terminating point conductor
insertion and test circuit tool allows a subscriber to insert a conductor to a proper

depth in a network services terminating point module without damaging the module.
The telephone service provider's line can be tested to the point of the network services

terminating point by inserting the test circuit into the module.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent
Application Serial No. 60/107,656 filed November 9, 1998, entitled "Network
Services Terminating Point Conductor Insertion and Test Circuit Tool," the disclosure
of which is incorporated herein by reference.This invention relates to an apparatus for assisting a telephone service
subscriber in connecting telephony communication equipment lines to a network
services terminating point and in testing a telephone service provider's line connected
to that terminating point.Since the changes in the regulation of the telephone industry, subscribers
rarely lease telephony communications equipment from the telephone service
provider. More often, subscribers will purchase their own equipment and connect it to
telephone lines provided by the telephone service provider.Telephone service providers often provide subscribers with service to a central
location in a subscriber's home or building. This central point is called the Network
Services Terminating Point (NSTP). Subscribers can then connect the telephone
equipment located throughout their homes or buildings to the NSTP. The NSTP
contains a module which can accept a plurality of conductors from the telephone
service provider and an equal number of mating pairs which correspond to the
telephony communications equipment within the subscribers' homes or buildings. These modules accept a plurality of mated pairs of conductors. The NSTP
module is constructed to accept conductors by pushing the conductors between two
resilient module contacts which spread apart to accept the conductor and then close
together, thereby frictionally holding the conductor in place. A screwdriver can be
used to insert the conductors into the module. The screwdriver, however, will often
bend the module contacts resulting in a less than perfect connection between a
conductor and a module contact.Typically, telephone service providers are responsible for maintenance on the
telephone line up to the NSTP. Telephone service providers normally do not service
the subscribers' privately owned equipment. It is, therefore, important for the
telephone service providers to be able to determine whether a problem exists on their
side of the NSTP or on the subscribers' side of the NSTP. If the problem is on the
telephone service providers' side of the NSTP, a service call will be made to correct
the problem. If, however, the problem is on the subscribers' side of the NSTP, a
service call will not be made and the subscribers must have
