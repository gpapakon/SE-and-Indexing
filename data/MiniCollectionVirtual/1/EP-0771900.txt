<ABSTRACT>
An iron (10) having a steam chamber cover (14) 
connected to the soleplate (12) without the use of 

additional fasteners or adhesives. The soleplate (12) has a 
raised steam chamber wall (18). A top of the steam chamber 

wall (18) has a channel (20). A rim (42) of the steam 
chamber cover (14) is positioned in the channel (20) and a 

portion (22) of the wall (18) is deformed to sealingly lock 

the rim (42) in the channel (20). The cover (14) can also 
be stamped towards the soleplate (12) to press the cover 

(14) against ribs (38) of the soleplate (12) inside the 
steam chamber (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steam iron, in particular 
to an improved steam chamber cover and soleplate connection 
and the method of making the connection. U.S. Patent No 4,471,541 discloses a steam iron where a 
peripheral flange of a cover is located in a channel of the 
soleplate. A pressure roller is then used to deform one 
edge of the soleplate at the channel against the flange of 
the cover. Other U.S. Patents that disclose various 
connections of steam chamber covers to soleplates include 
the following: 
U.S. Patent No 2,846,793U.S. Patent No 3,260,005 U.S. Patent No 3,930,325U.S. Patent No 4,240,217 U.S. Patent No 4,277,900U.S. Patent No 4,995,177 U.S. Patent No 5,079,823U.S. Patent No 5,146,700 The present invention provides a soleplate for an iron, 
which soleplate has a steam chamber wall, characterised in 
that the top of the steam chamber wall has a channel therein 
with an outer wall section on a first side of the channel 
and an inner wall section on a second side of the channel, 
wherein the inner wall section is lower than the outer wall 
section. The invention further provides an iron comprising: 
a steam chamber cover; and a soleplate having a perimeter of the cover located in 
a channel of the soleplate, the channel extending into a 
portion of a top of the soleplate, the portion having a 
first section located on an outer side of the channel and a 
second section located on an inner side of the channel, 
characterised in that the height of the first section is  
 
relatively greater than the height of the second section 
before the first section is deformed, the first section 
being deformed against the perimeter of the cover wherein 
the first and second sections have substantially the same 
height after the first section is deformed. The present invention provides a method of assembling 
an iron comprising the steps of: 
providing a soleplate with a channel on its 
top, a first section of the soleplate at a first side of the 
channel being higher than a second section of the soleplate 
at a second side of the channel; locating a steam chamber cover on the top of the 
soleplate, the cover having a rim that is located inside the 
channel; and deforming the first section of the soleplate into the 
channel to sandwich the rim between the first and second 
sections of the soleplate. The present invention further provides a method of 
assembling an iron comprising the steps of: 
connecting a steam chamber cover to a soleplate by 
deforming a portion of the soleplate onto the cover;

located in a channel (20) of the soleplate (12), the channel 

(20) extending into a portion (18) of a top of the soleplate 
(12), the portion (18) having a first section (22) located 

on an outer side of the channel (20) and a second section 
(24) located on an inner side of the channel (20), 

characterised in that the height of the first section (22) 
is relatively greater than the height of the second section 

(24) before the first section (22) is deformed, the first 
section (22) being deformed against the perimeter of the 

cover (14) wherein the first (22) and second (24) sections 
have substantially the same height after the first section 

is deformed. 
An iron as in Claim 1 characterised in that the 
perimeter of the cover (14) has an outwardly extending 

flange (46). 
An iron according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised 
in that the portion (18) of the soleplate (12) is a raised 

steam chamber wall (18) with the channel (20) being located 
in a top of the wall (18). 
An iron according to any of Claims 1 to 3 characterised 
in that at least a portion of the perimeter (42) of the 

cover (14) is sandwiched between the first (22) and second
