<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetically actuated valve (10) is disclosed having an upper electromagnetic element (32) and a lower electromagnetic element (34), each having a toroidal or annular configuration with a U-shaped cross section and in mirrored relationship with each other. The elements define a central chamber (26) and a central channel (30). A core element (16) has an annular horizontal cross section and is disposed intermediate the upper (32) and lower (34) electromagnetic elements. A connecting plate (18) connects the core element (16) to a valve stem (22). A spring (20) biases the core element (16) to a neutral position. Applying current to the upper electromagnetic element (32) closes the valve and interrupting the current to the upper electromagnetic element (32) and applying current to the lower electromagnetic element (34) opens the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
electromagnetically actuated valve, and more particularly to an
electromagnetically actuated valve with a unique electromagnetic
design to allow the opening and closing of the valve at high frequency
while using less power.In the past, valves have been designed for opening and closing
mechanisms that combine the action of springs with electromagnets.
However, the earlier designs did not operate quickly enough to open
and dose the valves with sufficient speed. For example, valves using
spring action could not be designed with the speed normally required
for the opening and closing of an internal combustion engine's intake
and exhaust valves, or for the speed required for air compressors.There are several clear physical factors for the reason why the
earlier valve designs could not operate at the desired high speeds.
First, the forces that an electromagnet can exert are proportional to the
area of the pole faces of the electromagnet. Second, the moving piece
must provide a return path for the magnetic flux that has the same
cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the flux, as the pole faces. Third,
there is a practical limit to the size of the magnetic field that can be
created in ferromagnetic materials. This limiting factor is referred to as
saturation. These three physical factors act together such that, in
previous designs, the mass of the piece providing the return path for
the magnetic flux could not be made small enough so that it could be 
accelerated quickly enough for the desired
applications, such as the modern internal combustion
engines.An electromagnetically operating setting device according to preamble of claim 1 is
known from US 5,131,624, which comprises two opposed
electromagnets, by means of which an armature actuating
the control element can be moved into two opposing
switching positions, wherein the equilibrium position
of a spring system lies between the switching
positions, and the working stroke of the control
element can be varied by changing the position of the
pole surface of an electromagnet and of the base of one
or more of the springs of the spring system.An actuator is also disclosed in US 4,719,882.
This document discloses an actuator having two opposed
solenoids with an actuator assembly disposed between
the opposing solenoids. By alternately energising the
solenoids, the actuator assembly can be moved between,
and held at, two mutually opposed operating positions. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention
