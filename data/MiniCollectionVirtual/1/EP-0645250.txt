A printing machine (1) having a control panel 
(2), where the housing (6) or suchlike has a panel 

holding fixture (3) to hold the removable control panel 
(2), whereby the control panel is connected by way of a 

cable (9), or without a cable by way of at least one 
infrared transmitter, to the components of the printing 

machine (1) which are to be controlled, characterized 
in that the control panel (2) is fixed in the panel 

holding fixture (3) by means of at least one magnet 
(10) at least in the withdrawal direction, in that the 

panel holding fixture (3) consists of plastics or 
aluminium, and in that in the region of each magnet 

(10) of the control panel (2) a metal insert (12) of 
ferromagnetic material is embedded in the plastics or 

the aluminium. 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to claim 1, characterized in that there is at 

least one permanent magnet (10) on the floor (11) of 
the box-type control panel (2). 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each 

permanent magnet (10) consists of a magnetic foil. 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that the magnets (10) are inlaid on 
the floor (14) of the control panel (2) in a flush 

manner or project from the floor (14) to form feet. 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to at least one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that the panel holding fixture (3) is 
constructed like a box, whereby at at least two 

opposing box walls (19, 20) in each case there is a 
transversely protruding fastening edge (21, 22) and at 

the box floor (11) a cable opening (13) is provided. 
A printing machine having a control panel  
 

according to claim 5, characterized in that the control 
panel (2) has a substantially square housing (24) with 

a circumferential, laterally projecting edge at the 
operating side, the outer dimensions of which 

correspond approximately to those of the cavity (17) of 
the panel holding fixture (3) in the region of the 

opening. 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to claim 6, characterized in that on the 

outside on the floor (14) of the control panel (2) a 
cable channel (25) is arranged which extends over at 

least three sides. 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to claim 7, characterized in that at each of 

the at least three sections of the cable channel (25) 
there is at least one transversely projecting holding 

tongue (26) or suchlike for the cable (9). 
A printing machine having a control panel 
according to one of claims 7 or 8, characterized in 

that a housing opening of the control panel (2) for the 
cable (9) for data transmission is allocated in part to 

at least one of the side walls (15) and in part to the 
floor (14).
