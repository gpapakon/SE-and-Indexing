<ABSTRACT>
A winding system for web-like (strip-like) photographic material is described, in which the photographic strip material (F) can be wound onto a winding core (spool core, bobbin) of a strip material cassette (film reel or film cassette or paper cassette) (1), which can be fitted or positioned on the unwinding side or the winding (take-up) side in the treatment stations of a photographic processing unit. The strip material cassette (1) is equipped with a holding and clamping device (2) for the end of the photographic strip material (F), which holding and clamping device can be optionally actuated manually or with the aid of a preferably automatic actuation device (10) such that the end of the wound photographic strip material (F) is held and clamped in or is present in a loose form.

the winding spool at the unwinding or winding end in processing stations of a
photographic processing installation, and having a holding and clamping appliance (2),

which is applied to the rotatable winding spool, characterised in that the holding and
clamping appliance (2) is arranged in such a way that it releasably clamps and holds the

run-off end of the strip material between clamping elements (23, 24).
Winding spool according to Claim 1, characterised in that the holding and clamping
appliance is attached to the winding spool so that it can be pivoted out.
Winding spool according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the holding and clamping
appliance (2) comprises a movable strap (21, 22) with clamping elements (23, 24)

arranged on it, which strap (21, 22) can be pivoted out of a first stable end position, in
which the end of the strip material is clamped and held between the clamping elements

(23, 24), into a second stable end position, in which the clamping elements (23, 24) are
out of engagement with the end of the strip material.
Winding spool according to Claim 3, characterised in that the strap (21, 22) is provided
in and integrated into a vertical side wall (3) of the strip material cassette (1), and in that

the clamping elements (23, 24) are arranged at their front end in the region of the
periphery of the side wall (3) and extend approximately transverse to the side wall (3)

and to the surface of the strip material (F).
Winding spool according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the strap is in two parts
and comprises an upper and a lower strap part (21 and 22), in that the clamping

elements (23, 24), for example a clamping strip or one or a plurality of clamping fingers,
are respectively arranged at the front end of the strap parts (21, 22), and in that recesses

(26, 27) are provided opposite to one another at the front ends of the strap parts (21,
22). 
Winding spool according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the holding and
clamping appliance (2) is provided in an additional side wall (3) of the strip material

cassette (1), which is connected to the spool core in such a way that it can be slightly
rotated radially relative to the spool core in the op
en condition of the holding and
clamping appliance (2) whereas it can only be rotated with difficulty when the holding

and clamping appliance (2) is in the condition where it is pivoted in.
Winding system having at least one winding spool according to one of Claims 1 to 6 and
having at least one automatic actuation appliance which actuates the holding and

clamping appliance to release or hold the strip material.
System according to Claim 7, characterised in that the at least one automatic actuation
appliance (10, 30) for the holding and clamping appliance (2) is provided on the winding

spool (1) on the winding or unwinding end of one or a plurality of processing stations
and is configured in such a way that it can be brought into engagement with the holding

and clamping appliance (2) in order to open it and to contain the end of the
photographic strip material (F) or to close the holding and clamping appliance (2) so that

the end of the strip material is available in such a way that it is clamped in and held.
System according to Claim 8, characterised in that the at least one automatic actuation
appliance (10, 30) for the holding and clamping appliance (2) provided at the unwinding

or winding end of the one or a plurality of individual processing stations can be
displaced in or against the general transport direction of the strip material (F) in the

respective processing station.
System according to Claim 9, characterised in that each automatic actuation appliance
(10, 30) comprises a slide (11, 31), which can be displaced longitudinally along one or a

plurality of guide rods (12, 32), and a spar (13, 33) extending essentially vertically from
the slide (11, 31), on the upper end of which spar (13, 33) is arranged a cap piece (14,

34) with the device (15, 35) for pivoting the strap parts (21, 22), which device (15, 35)
is also configured for spreading out the clamping elements (23, 24) and comprises a pin

or a similar element which can be moved by an actuator transverse to the transport
direction of the strip material (F) towards the side wall (3) and in the opposite direction. 
System according to Claim 10, characterised in that a flat disc (16, 36), which has a
groove on its end surface, is arranged at the front end of the pin (15, 35), and in that the

diameter of the disc and the width of the groove are selected in such a way that the flat
disc (16, 36) can be pushed into the recesses (26, 27) on the front ends of the strap parts

clamping appliance (2).
System according to Claim 12, characterised in that the capture means are two guide
flaps (17) with one or a plurality of circulating guide tapes (19) which are connected to a

material strip (F) can be guided to the spool core of the strip material cassette (1) so that
it can be captured there.
System according to Claim 14, characterised in that the feed device comprises two
spoon-type guide arms (37, 38), which can be pivoted in, which encompass the winding

core in the pivoted-in condition and which form a narrow guide channel for the leading
end of the material strip (F), which guide channel reaches as far as the spool core from a

transport roller pair (S) at outlet from the respective processing station.
System according to one of Claims 8 to 15, characterised in that one or a plurality of
