<ABSTRACT>
A circuit interconnecting device for industrial 
applications comprising a card-edge connector (13) 

arranged on a mainboard (1) and associable, by 
means of a connector (15) located on a card (14) 

for interconnection with external control devices; 
said card for interconnection also exhibiting 

output connectors (16 and 17) as well as a circuit 
section (18) for interfacing with the external 

control devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit interconnecting 
device, for use in industrial applications 
comprising a plurality of peripheral units which 
are electrically connected with at least one 
terminal wiring board, which is in turn connected 
in output to control devices. In the industrial field the sheer number of 
circuits is enormous, rendering wiring-up of often 
very varied devices an expensive exercise, 
especially with respect to control panels. The above is especially relevant with regard to 
industrial applications where a plurality of 
peripheral devices have to be wired up with minute 
care on at least one mainboard, normally situated 
at the boxed control panel. This mainboard receives all of the wires coming 
from the plurality of peripheral devices, all of 
which are different from one another and obviously 
have interfaces which are also more or less 
equally varied. Bearing in mind the above, it can be seen that the  
 
ordering of the various connection wires, bringing 
them to the respective interface and connecting 
them up to the mainboard or mainboards is a 
considerably complicated task. The task is even more complicated in situations 
where in-house security systems are concerned, 
snince by their nature these require a 
heterogeneous plurality of sensors distributed 
over a whole industrial plant: here the assembly 
of all the wires on the mainboard is extremely 
complicated. For the above reasons devices have been realized 
which attempt to overcome those problems by wiring 
the various sensors and/or peripheral devices to 
groups of like types. A previous patent by the same applicant, Italian 
patent no. 2230A/90, solved this problem in part 
by realizing an interconnecting device which 
allowed the plurality of wires to be connected in 
a simple and orderly fashion, so that the origin 
of each single wire could easily be determined. This mainboard, however, was not universally 
applicable to each control apparatus existing in 
plants downstream of the mainboard itself. In 
fact, for every control apparatus there had to be  
 
an interface for connecting up to the wires in 
output from the mainboard. More precisely, once all of the wires originating 
from the peripheral devices had been orderedly 
arranged on the mainboard, the signals from the 
wires had to be transferred to outputs which by 
their nature are very heterogeneous, ranging from 
internal security circuits to fire-detecting and 
prevention circuits to movement circuits, and so 
on. The prior art offers simple
