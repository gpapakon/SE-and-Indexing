<ABSTRACT>
A safety penetrating instrument comprises an elongate, 
tubular needle having a longitudinal axis, a proximal end 

and a distal end having a peripheral edge, the edge being 
disposed in a plane at an acute angle to the longitudinal 

axis of the needle, thereby defining a sharp tip for 
penetrating anatomical tissue; a safety probe movably 

disposed within the needle and having a proximal end and a 
distal end having an angled end surface, the safety probe 

being movable between an extended position, in which its 
distal end protrudes from the needle tip, and a retracted 

position, in which its angled end surface is substantially 
coplanar with the needle peripheral edge, thereby exposing 

the needle tip and providing a smooth tissue penetrating 
surface; a hub for receiving the proximal ends of the 

needle and the safety probe; bias means for biasing the 
safety probe toward its extended position and which, in 

response to a proximally directed force applied to the 
safety probe distal end, permits the safety probe distal 

end to move to its retracted position; an elongate, tubular 
portal sleeve surrounding the needle and having a distal 

end disposed adjacent the needle distal end and a proximal 
end; a housing which abutts the hub and to which the 

proximal end of the needle is secured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to surgical penetrating 
instruments and, more particularly, to safety surgical 
penetrating instruments having tubular needles for penetrating 
tissue and safety probes for protecting the sharp tips of the 
needles. Surgical penetrating instruments are widely used in 
surgical procedures to gain access to anatomical cavities 
ranging in size from the abdomen to small blood vessels, such 
as veins and arteries, epidural, pleural and subarachnoid 
spaces, heart ventricles and spinal and synovial cavities. 
Such surgical penetrating instruments include a penetrating 
member or implement having a sharp tip or point to pierce or 
penetrate the tissue forming the cavity wall, and the force 
required to penetrate the cavity wall is dependent upon the 
type and thickness of the tissue of the wall. Once the wall 
is penetrated, it is desirable to protect the sharp tip of the 
penetrating member to prevent inadvertent contact with tissue 
in or forming the cavity, and a particular problem exists 
where substantial force is required to penetrate the cavity 
wall in that, once penetration is achieved, the lack of tissue 
resistance can result in the sharp tip travelling too far into 
the cavity and injuring adjacent tissue. Safety penetrating instruments including a safety probe 
biased to extend beyond the sharp tip of a penetrating member 
have become widely accepted for use in penetrating anatomical 
cavities. For example, the Verres needle, commonly used to 
create a pneumoperitoneum, has a spring-loaded inner member 
disposed within a tubular needle. U.S. Patents No. 1,527,291 
to Zorraquin, No. 2,623,521 to Shaw and No. 2,630,803 to Baran 
are exemplary of safety penetrating instruments with a 
spring-loaded inner member disposed in a needle, while U.S.  
 
Patent No. 4,254,762 to Yoon shows an endoscope spring-biased 
in a hollow needle. Safety trocars having a spring-biased 
protective shield disposed between an outer sleeve and an 
inner trocar are marketed by Ethicon, Inc. as the Endopath and 
by United States Surgical Corp. as the Surgiport. U.S. Patents 
No. 4,535,773 to Yoon and No. 4,654,030 to Moll et al are 
exemplary of such safety trocars. German Offenlegungsschrift 
2,544,262 discloses an intrauterine catheter including a tube 
having a distal sharp point, a spring-biased blunt member in 
the tube distal end and a hose or catheter slidable over the 
tube. While the prior art safety penetrating instruments are 
widely used, they suffer from many disadvantages when

<CLAIMS>
A safety penetrating instrument (30) comprising: 
   an elongate, tubular needle (32) having a longitudinal 

axis, a proximal end (51) and a distal end (42) having a 
peripheral edge (44), the edge being disposed in a plane at 

an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of the needle, 
thereby defining a sharp tip (46) for penetrating 

anatomical tissue; 
   a safety probe (34) movably disposed within the needle 

and having a proximal end (70) and a distal end (66) having 
an angled end surface (68), the safety probe being movable 

between an extended position, in which its distal end 
protrudes from the needle tip, and a retracted position, in 

which its angled end surface is substantially coplanar with 
the needle peripheral edge, thereby exposing the needle tip 

and providing a smooth tissue penetrating surface; 
   a hub (38) for receiving the proximal ends of the 

needle and the safety probe; 
   bias means (80) for biasing the safety probe toward 

its extended position and which, in response to a 
proximally directed force applied to the safety probe 

distal end, permits the safety probe distal end to move to 
its retracted position; 

   an elongate, tubular portal sleeve (36) surrounding 
the needle and having a distal end (94) disposed adjacent 

the needle distal end and a proximal end (100); 
   a housing (40) which abutts the hub and to which the 

proximal end of the needle is secured. 
An instrument according to claim 1, wherein the angled 
end surface (68) of the safety probe is rounded to have a 

partially spherical configuration. 
An instrument according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the distal end of the safety probe has a hole (67) therein. 
An instrument according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the angled end surface (122) of the safety probe 

has an expandable rim (124) extending therefrom, the rim 
expanding on movement of the safety probe from its 

 
retracted position to its extended position, thereby 

preventing tissue being trapped between the distal ends of 
the needle and the safety probe.
