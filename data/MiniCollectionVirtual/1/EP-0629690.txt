<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cleaning compositions.
More particularly, the cleaning compositions according to the
present invention are stable aqueous emulsions of nonionic
surfactants.A great variety of cleaning compositions have been described
in the art. For instance, in co-pending European Patent
Application EP-A-598 170, a particular type of cleaning
compositions is described which are aqueous emulsions of a
nonionic surfactant system. Such emulsions find a preferred
application in the formulation of bleaching compositions
comprising hydrogen peroxide or water soluble source thereof
and a liquid hydrophobic bleach activator, or any other
hydrophobic ingredient which needs to be separated from
hydrogen peroxide. Alternatively, such emulsions can be used
to formulate products which do not contain hydrogen peroxide.
In the latter case, such emulsions can be useful because they
allow to keep a given hydrophobic ingredient separate from
the aqueous phase, with which said hydrophobic ingredient 
could react, e.g., by hydrolysis. Another advantage of such
emulsions is that they provide a means to formulate
ingredients with very low water solubility, without the need
for using alcoholic or solvent mixtures, which are usually
undesirable for aesthetic (odour) and toxicity reasons.However, a problem with such emulsions especially with
emulsions containing relatively high concentration of
surfactants, e.g., about 8 %, is that important viscosity
tends to build up, which makes said emulsions difficult to
dispense, and thus unacceptable from a consumer viewpoint.It is thus an object of the present invention to formulate
aqueous emulsions of nonionic surfactants wherein the
viscosity can be conveniently controlled.Various viscosity agents such as sodium cumene sulphonate and
polyacrylates have been tried in this context, which resulted
in a decreased viscosity but also reduced phase stability.It is thus another object of the present invention to provide
aqueous emulsions of nonionic surfactants wherein the
viscosity can be conveniently controlled while maintaining
adequate physical stability.US-4648 987 relates to an aqueous laundry prewash composition
for treating fabric spots and stains comprising a
cosurfactant system, a hydrotrope, xantham gum and water. It has now been found that this object can be efficiently
met by formulating aqueous emulsions of nonionic surfactants
which comprise terephthalate-based polyesters. In other
words, it has now been found that terephthalate-based
polyesters reduce the
