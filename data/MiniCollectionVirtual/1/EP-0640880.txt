<ABSTRACT>
Small and closely spaced features (5) are used for global and local 
alignment during lithographic patterning. The features (5) are sufficiently small so 

that the spun on resist (9) has an approximately planar surface over the features (5) 
thereby eliminating errors in measuring position caused by variations in optical 

thickness of the resist (9). Such variations lead to shifts in the apparent locations of 
the features (5) when the intensity of reflected radiation is measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods for integrated circuit 
manufacturing which includes aligning wafers for lithographic patterning and 
particularly to methods using features on the wafers for alignment and to the 
patterned substrate. Integrated circuit fabrication requires a plurality of lithographic 
patterning steps in which selected portions of a resist covered substrate are exposed 
to radiation transmitted through a mask at each patterning step. The resist, which is 
a radiation sensitive material, is then processed and selected portions removed to 
expose the underlying substrate. Whether the exposed or unexposed portions of the 
resist are removed depends upon whether the resist is a positive or negative resist, 
respectively. The radiation used for patterning features having submicron 
dimensions is, for example, ultraviolet radiation. Further processing of the now 
exposed portions of the substrate, for example, etching, cleaning, or ion 
implantation, is then performed. The term "substrate" is used to mean any material 
that lies underneath and supports another material. The substrate may thus be an 
upper level metal, etc. Device fabrication, of course, requires that each patterning 
step or level be accurately aligned with respect to the preceding step on the wafer. 
The requirements for alignment accuracy increase as device dimensions decrease. 
Satisfaction of alignment requirements is made more difficult because each wafer 
has many chips; each step must be accurately aligned with respect to the preceding 
step for each chip. The projected image for each level comes from a stepper, and the 
projected image must be precisely moved from chip to chip for accurate pattern 
transfer. Methods for aligning the wafer with respect to the projected image from 
the stepper for patterning have been developed. Many of these methods require a 
determination of two or more positions on the substrate. This is frequently done by 
fabricating features, such as islands or trenches in the top layer or in a layer near the 
top layer, and spinning on resist which covers the features. The wafer is then 
illuminated with a radiation source, either broad or narrow band, and the reflected or 
scattered light intensity measured from different positions on the wafer. The 
intensity of the reflected radiation varies because of the presence of the features; in 
particular, there is a minimum in intensity near the edges of the features.
