<ABSTRACT>
A wire-cut electrical 
discharge machine capable of 

controlling a discharge current 
to constant. Provided between 

a main current power source 
(71) and a capacitor (C) is 

a current detecting unit (72) 
which converts electric current 

(I₃) flowing through a closed 
circuit formed by the main 

current power source (71) and 
the capacitor (C) into voltage 

to detect the same, and the 
detected result is transmitted 

to a control unit (500) after it 
is smoothed by a smoothing 

circuit unit (73). Also, electric 
discharge between a wire (49) 

and a work (36) is detected by 
a discharge detecting unit (62). 

A processing unit (52) of the 
control unit (500) calculates 

a sum of the electric current 
(I₃) per one cycle of electric 

discharge machining on the 
basis of the converted voltage 

value of the electric current 
(I₃) transmitted through the 

smoothing circuit unit (73) 
and the number of electric 

discharges counted by a counting unit (53). The discharge control unit (55) controls a pulse width of a drive signal 
(SS) being fed to a main current switches (S2, S3) so that the sum of the electric current (I₃) per one cycle of electric 

discharge machining amounts to a reference value. Accordingly, an appropriate drive signal (SS) can be output 
taking into consideration temperature changes during an operational lag time of the main current switches (S2, S3), 

so that it is possible to readily maintain discharge currents (I
2a,
 I
2b
) at desired values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire-cut electric
discharge machine for machining a workpiece by producing
electric discharge by applying a pulse voltage between a wire
and a workpiece.A wire-cut electric discharge machine effects
electric discharge machining by intermittently flowing a
current between a wire and a workpiece using a switching element
such as an FET or the like. Although the machining
characteristics at the time are affected by a magnitude of a
discharge current, the magnitude of the discharge current is
determined by the discharge pulse width of a main current circuit,
the power supply voltage of the main current circuit and the
circuit impedance of an electric discharge cable and the like.Incidentally, the discharge pulse width is affected
by the operation delay time of a switching circuit and the
operation delay time of the switching circuit is affected by
temperature. As a result, a value of a discharge current is
changed by the change of the operation delay time of the
switching circuit caused by the temperature variation.
Further, the value of the discharge current is also changed by
the change of the power supply voltage of the main current 
circuit and the circuit impedance of the electric discharge
cable and the like due to temperature variation. When the
value of the discharge current is changed, the machining
characteristics are changed and machining cannot be stably
effected.To cope with this problem, although the discharge
pulse width is regulated by sensing a discharge current
flowing to the workpiece and the wire so that a desired
discharge current can be obtained, a problem arises in that
since the operation for sensing the discharge current is
affected by noise, it is difficult to correctly sense the
discharge current and consequently the discharge pulse
width cannot be accurately regulated.An object of the present invention made by taking the
above into consideration is to provide a wire-cut electric
discharge machine capable of easily controlling a discharge
current to an unvaried value.To solve the above problem, according to the present
invention, there is provided, a wire-cut electric discharge
machine for machining a workpiece by producing electric
discharge by applying a pulse voltage between a wire and
the workpiece, the machine comprising:
main current drive means having a main current power
supply and providing a discharge current with a
predetermined electric discharge pulse width which
contributes to actual machining; andcurrent sensing means for sensing
