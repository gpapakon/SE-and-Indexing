<ABSTRACT>
A hanger is intended for receiving T-profile rails (1), which exhibit a border bead (5) on an upwardly projecting profile web. A sheet-metal hanger part (3) is configured in the form of an upside-down U and exhibits two retaining legs (4) which, in the closed state, bear against the outer sides of the border bead (5). The retaining legs (4), which can be bent open elastically, engage on both sides, by means of their bottom ends, angled off with respect to one another, beneath the border bead (5).
