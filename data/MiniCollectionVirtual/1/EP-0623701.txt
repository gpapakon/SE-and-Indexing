<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous finish compositions containing a nitrogen-containing textile 
finish compound for treatment of synthetic fibers are disclosed, 

characterized in that they further contain a nitrosamine inhibitor. 
The use of such compositions for treating synthetic fibers to thereby 

reduce the level of nitrosamine on their surface and fibers so treated 
are further disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new finish compositions for synthetic fibers, 
synthetic fibers treated with such finish compositions and the use of 
such compositions for reducing the amount of nitrosamine on the 
surface of such fibers. More particularly, this invention relates to an 
aqueous finish composition comprising a nitrogen-containing textile 
finish compound for treatment of synthetic fibers characterized in 
that it further contains a nitrosamine inhibitor. This invention 
relates further to the use of such compositions for treating synthetic 
fibers to thereby reduce the level of nitrosamine on their surface and 
fibers so treated. The production and downstream treatment of synthetic or man-made 
fibers entails contacting the fiber at various stages with a 
finish composition to impart various properties, e.g. lubrication and 
antistatic properties. Synthetic fiber production employs textile 
finishes during spinning, drawing, crimping and cutting of the fiber, 
and downstream of the fabric production, e.g. ring-, open-end- and 
air-jet-spinning, knitting, weaving, dyeing and finishing. These 
finish compositions are typically aqueous and often contain a 
nitrogen-containing textile finish compound and are per se known in 
the art. Such compositions typically also contain one or more 
additional agents such as emulsifiers, dispersants, surfactants, 
lubricants, softening agents, wetting agents, antimicrobials, cohesive 
agents, slickening agents, dyeing assistants and the like. A drawback of known textile finish compositions, however, is that 
the nitrogen-containing textile finish compounds they contain can 
form nitrosamines at the high temperatures employed typically 
during the drawing, crimping and drying processes, as well as in the 
downstream heat-requiring steps, e.g. thermobonding processes. The 
nitrogen-containing textile finish compounds are believed to react 
with nitrous oxides (NOx) in the hot air stream and/or the 
atmosphere to form nitrosamines at the fiber surface. Although 
these nitrosamines are typically present only in minute quantities on 
the surface of the fiber, e.g. 10-200 parts per billion (ppb) it is  
 
nevertheless highly desirable to inhibit or completely eliminate their 
formation as nitrosamines are believed to play a role in causing 
cancer and other diseases. It is known in the art to use certain compounds such as 
polyethylenimines or tocopherols to inhibit nitrosamine formation or 
as antioxidants in the context of certain polymer production (cf. e.g.
