<ABSTRACT>
Sensor devices for detecting components in fluid samples, especially by electrolytic analytical methods, comprising a detecting means (usually an anode, especially one of platinum) surrounded by a selectively permeable membrane barrier composed of a mixture of polyvinyl chloride and polyaryl sulphone polymers. Preferred proportions of the polymers are 1 to 9 parts of polyaryl sulphone for each part of polyvinyl chloride, and the mixture may be formed into membranes by solution casting. Preferably this barrier is used with an inner membrane, especially of porous polycarbonate. In use, these polymer mixtures are especially useful in their selective permeability to glucose. Also provided are methods for their use in analysis, and the polyvinyl chloride/polyaryl sulphone polymer compositions themselves and membranes made from them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sensor devices such as are used in 
the determination of a component or components which may be 
present in a fluid sample, such as a physiological fluid (e.g. 
blood) or other fluids of biological origin (e.g. fruit), process 
fluids or effluents. Many forms of sensor have been proposed, and commonly these 
rely on some form of membrane to control the extent to which the 
components present in a sample under examination can gain access 
to an electrode, at which they can then be detected and 
determined. Especially, it is well known to make sensors using 
membranes to separate the media being analysed from the active 
electrode itself. The main function of the membrane is to 
separate, as far as possible, those components which are 
desirable (i.e. can take part in the reactions at the electrode 
on which the desired determination depends) from interferents 
(i.e. compounds which may be present but are undesirable because 
they either interfere with the progress of the desired 
determination reactions or take part in reactions of their own 
which compete with those of the component sought and distort or 
overwhelm the signals which are to be measured. The forms of 
construction have much in common with each other, and mainly 
differ in the nature of the membrane or media within it or 
combined with it in some way. Some forms of sensor rely on the components used to make the 
membrane, while others rely on the mode of fabrication of the 
membrane, selecting its physical properties (for example its 
porosity) or treatments given to it, as these factors can control 
its effectiveness and selectivity in use, or to the conditions 
under which the sensor is used. Other forms of sensors incorporate an enzyme, which converts 
one substrate compound or analyte into another which may then be 
more easily measured. Especially, it is known to use oxidase 
enzymes, which generate hydrogen peroxide -- a substance which 
can be measured very conveniently and very accurately by 
electrolytic methods, especially amperometrically. An example is European Patent No. 216577 (of ICI PLC) which  
 
specifies an enzyme electrode sensor with membrane barrier 
of low (>5%) porosity. Materials which have been proposed for the fabrication 
of membranes for sensors include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) -- 
but it has been stated to be essential for it to be only in 
plasticised form, as described in European Patent 
Application No. 92302131.5 (Publication No. 0503943). It has also been proposed in European
