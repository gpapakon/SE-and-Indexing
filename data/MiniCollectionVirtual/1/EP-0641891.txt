<ABSTRACT>
Base (socket), of the type comprising a base body (10) in the shape of a widely flared bell and having, at the top, a passage (14) for the post (11), characterised in that it comprises, arranged in the base body (10), a support block (15) for at least lateral bearing of the post (11), a mating flange (19) for holding the post (11) against the support block (15), and means (20; 26) for clamping the mating flange (19) which are accessible from outside the base body (10). Advantageously, the support block (15) furthermore comprises a seat (16) providing axial bearing for the bottom of the post (11), which seat may also comprise an axial passage (33) for passage of means (35A, 35B) for fastening the base to the ground or for fastening a rod at one of its ends, its other end being capable of passing through the post (11) in order to make it possible to fasten accessories.

A pedestal base for a post or cylindrical tubular 
foot (11), of the type comprising a widely flared bell-shaped 

pedestal body (10) and having at the top (13) a 
passage (14) for the post (11), comprising, provided in the 

pedestal body (10), an at least lateral support for the post 
(11), a counterflange (19) for maintaining the post (11) 

against the support, and clamping means (20,20'; 26,26') for 
the counterflange (19) accessible from outside the pedestal 

body (10), characterised in that the lateral support is 
formed by the inner surface of a semicylindrical portion 

(17) which has a base block (15) in contination of the 
passage (14), said pedestal body (10) having a vertical 

portion (24) opposite the portion (17), said vertical 
portion (24) being substantially cylindrical, slightly set-back 

in relation to the passage (14) and intended to receive 
the counterflange (19), the pedestal body being formed in 

one piece by moulding. 
A pedestal according to claim 1, characterised in 
that two transverse passages (25,25') for fastening screws 

(20,20') are provided in the pedestal body (10), said 
transverse passages (25,25') opening at one of their ends on 

to the outer surface of the pedestal body (10), and having 
at their other end a blind portion (29,39') extending from 

an abutment surface (30,30') of the portion (17) of the base 
block (15) and provided with a suitable thread (26,26') for 

the fastening screws (20,20') 
A pedestal according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the counterflange (19) is formed by a substantially 

circular clamping half-collar which comprises two securing 
wings (22,22') provided with perforations (23,23') for the 

passage of the fastening screws (20,20') and adapted to cooperate 
with said abutment surfaces (30,30').  

 
A pedestal according to either claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterised in that each of the threads is formed by a 

nut (26,26') accommodated in a recess (27,27') which is 
accessible via an axial passage (21,21') provided in the 

pedestal body (10) and opening on to the inner surface of 
the pedestal body (10). 
A pedestal according to claim 4, characterised in 
that each axial passage (21,21') comprises an axial guide 

groove (28,28') provided in the semicylindrical portion (17) 
of the base block (15). 
A pedestal according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the semicylindrical portion 

(17) of the base block (15) extends vertically up to a 
horizontal circular portion forming a seat (16) intended to 

receive the base of the post (11). 
A pedestal according to claim 6, characterised in 

that the seat (16) has a cup (32) surrounded by an annular 
lip (18), an oblong axial passage (33) and a circular recess 

(34) of a diameter which is substantially larger than that 
of the axial passage (33). 
A pedestal according to either claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterised in that the upper face of the seat (16) is 

arranged at a sufficient distance from the vertical portion 
(24) of the pedestal body (10) receiving the transverse 

passages (25,25') to allow adequate access for the 
installation of the counterflange (19) at the inner surface 

of the pedestal body (10) and to define a retention zone 
which is sufficient to ensure satisfactory fixing and 

satisfactory stability of the post (11). 
A pedestal according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the seat (16) comprises an axial passage (33) for the 

passage of means (35A,35B) for fastening the pedestal to the 
ground. 
A pedestal according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the seat (16) is provided for the fastening of a rod 

(42) threaded at least at both ends, said rod (42) being 
sufficiently long to pass through and extend beyond the  

 
post (11) so as enable accessories to be fastened thereto. 
A pedestal according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that a flat disc (41) for contact with 

the ground is secured under the base (12) of the pedestal 
body (10). 
A pedestal according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
